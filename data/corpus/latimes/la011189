MARYLOUISE OATES: SALUTE TO WISE DRAWS STAR SHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marylouise Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You just don't see a whole lot of invitations like this -- even in a town 
where, in the ever-escalating battle for benefit bucks, committee lists begin 
to look like a litany of the rich 'n' famous. 
</P>
<P>
When director Robert Wise is honored by the American Friends of Tel Aviv 
University on Jan. 21, "special guests" will include Julie Andrews, Walter 
Matthau, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston and Larry Hagman. 
</P>
<P>
Director Taylor Hackford will preside, and Burt Lancaster will do the 
toastmaster honors, while the honorary dinner chairs are Leonard Bernstein, 
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and Dr. Armand Hammer. Paramount's Howard W. Koch is the 
dinner chair -- and, if only 10% of the lengthy list of 52 associate chairmen, 
57 associate dinner chairmen and 76 host committee members show up for the 
Beverly Hilton black-tie event, it will be quite a brand-name jam. 
</P>
<P>
And quite a lucrative one, too, since the ticket price is $1,000 a couple. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Wise has such Hollywood connections. One of America's premier 
directors, he has on his resume "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "I Want to 
Live," "West Side Story," "The Sound of Music," "Audrey Rose" and "Star Trek." 
He has served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
and as president of the Directors Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
BEST L.A. STORY OF THE YEAR -- Just a few days into January and here it is -- 
short and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
As screenwriter Gloria Goldsmith tells it, she took her leased Nissan to the 
leasing company to be serviced. She was called early last week and, when she 
showed up the day after the call to pick up the car, it couldn't be found. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder -- it had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
To a dealer. And when the leasing company tried to buy it back, the dealer had 
already sold it. 
</P>
<P>
But everything turned out OK. The dealer bought it back from the buyer, the 
leasing company bought it back from the dealer, and Goldsmith is driving it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
AT IT AGAIN -- From the folks who brought us last fall's newspaper parody "The 
Washington Possible" now comes the L.A. Inaugural Ball -- "The Political Party 
for the Rest of Us." The invitation for the Jan. 20 bash is a smaller version 
of the newspaper, but this one carries the headline "Bush's Inaugural Message: 
'Don't Worry; Be Happy . . . New President Urges Upbeat Mood During Coming 
Depression." Oh, yes, "present your ACLU card for a 10% discount." The credit 
for the party goes to publicist Josh Baran and Rob Vinson, of the 2nd Coming, 
the new dance club on South Bonnie Brae, two blocks east of Alvarado at 9th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
MARK THE FEBRUARY CALENDARS -- Oakwood School salutes 10 years of service by 
its headmaster, Jim Astman, with a more-than-all-star benefit show at the 
Wiltern Theatre on Feb. 5. Among those performing are Rhea Perlman, Mort Sahl, 
Henry Winkler and David Steinberg in a tribute being written variety-show style 
by Iris Dart and Ann Beckett. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That same Sunday night, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera will be honored by the 
Beverly Hills Charitable Foundation and the Beverly Hills B'nai B'rith Lodge as 
men of the year. Tickets for the black-tie event are $350 and $500 a couple -- 
although the invite does point out that for children, black tie is only 
optional and the tickets are $75. 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason for that striking exception, since the evening begins early 
with Hanna-Barbera costumed characters posing for pictures with young (and 
perhaps not-so-young guests). The party is at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and MCA 
President Sidney Sheinberg is honorary chair, while Great American 
Broadcasting's chairman Charles S. Mechem Jr. is the honorary co-chair. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art unveils "Hispanic Art in the United States 
-- 30 Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors" at a black-tie reception Feb. 1. 
The exhibit has been organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and was 
made possible by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Atlantic 
Richfield Foundation, while the national tour was sponsored by the At&amp;T 
Foundation. The Los Angeles presentation was made possible by the W. Alton 
Jones Foundation.

JACK SMITH: SHOWING THEIR CLAWS OVER HIS CAT THEORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is axiomatic that anything you write about cats will be controversial. I can 
think of no other animal that has so divided humankind into such hostile camps. 
</P>
<P>
In observing the other day that cats were incapable of showing humiliation, I 
have provoked the author John D. Weaver into vigorous disagreement, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
"You are dead wrong," he says simply. "Missy, the amber-eyed, taffy-colored 
tabby that moved in with us four years ago is, as you wrote with your 
characteristic accuracy, 'independent, insolent, intractable, inquisitive, 
infuriating, morally intemperate and intellectually inaccessible.' She is also 
elegant, haughty and deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
(Let me say here that I would certainly have included 'haughty' among the 
traits I listed, except that it doesn't begin with in. I was seeking a literary 
consistency. Also I have never denied that cats are elegant and deceptive. They 
are, in fact, the most duplicitous of creatures.) 
</P>
<P>
"From my workroom sliding glass door," Weaver goes on, "I watch her awaken from 
a nap with a gentle, innocent look and then next morning I'll find a dead blue 
jay on the mat outside the door. Lady Macbeth will be asleep on a patio chair 
nearby." 
</P>
<P>
(That seems to bear out my statement that cats are sinister as well as 
deceptive.) 
</P>
<P>
"She pads about the place with a dignity and grace befitting her ancient 
Egyptian ancestry. The first time I saw her misjudge a routine leap from floor 
to bookcase I was confronted by the most eloquent expression of humiliation I'd 
ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver says that, like me, he admires cats for their independence. "Missy and I 
both know damned well she's never going to fetch me the morning paper. I grew 
up on dogs, but on a recent visit to the San Diego Zoo the animal that held me 
the longest was the wolf. This, I concluded, is what dogs must have been like 
before they sold out." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps their memory of having sold out is what makes dogs so subject to 
embarrassment, an emotion I personally have never observed in cats, despite 
Weaver's Missy. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Silver of Arleta insists that cats are not only capable of embarrassment, 
but also of that even more human emotion -- compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"My white, blue-eyed Persian," she says, "knowing herself to be by far more 
beautiful than the other cats, never associates with them. Yet, when she fell 
off the ironing board in her sleep, the tortoise shell that she had snubbed all 
her life ran over and 'kissed' her all over her face. Of course, Frosty stood 
up and walked away as if nothing had happened, and continued to treat poor 
Gatita like an unwelcome dust ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," she adds, "cats are smarter than most men give them credit for." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several readers note that if I want to give our two new kittens 
names that reflect both the eternal feminine and the sinister, I could do 
better than Lorelei and Pandora (which were only tentative). 
</P>
<P>
"Why not Hedda and Louella?" asks Frank McDonald of Gardena. "After all, you're 
a newspaperman, and you probably remember all the 'spitting and clawing' those 
two did at each other." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald obviously refers to those two feline Hollywood gossip columnists, 
Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the same two names are suggested by Anne Olmstead of La 
Crescenta. "Reading your list of the characteristics you feel that you share 
with cats, the first six suggested two names to me. Independent, insolent, 
indolent, intractable, inquisitive, infuriating -- who but Hedda and Louella? 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps 'indolent' does not suit these long-gone but still remembered 
personalities, and I'm not at all sure what you mean by 'morally intemperate 
and intellectually inaccessible,' but do at least consider my offering." 
</P>
<P>
In case anyone else was uncertain, by "morally intemperate" I meant 
promiscuous, and by "intellectually inaccessible" I meant inscrutable. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Gross of Laguna Hills suggests Sheila and Lolly, obviously referring 
to Louella (Lolly) Parsons and Sheila Graham, another Hollywood columnist who 
was the mistress of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stearns of Santa Barbara says he likes Mandu, the name of a neighbor's 
cat, but his own cat is named Fido. That's a good idea. I might name one Fido 
and the other Rover, just for the incongruity of it. 
</P>
<P>
Might be interesting to see if that embarrassed them.

ALICE KAHN: TV'S ELIXIR TOO STRONG TO RESIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I started back slowly but surely. A "Murphy Brown" here, a "Who's the Boss?" 
there. I guess by the time I got to "Tattinger's" and "Night Caller," I knew I 
was on a bender. I tried to take it one day at a time, but by New Year's Eve I 
was watching reruns of "One Day at a Time." The great TV strike was history. I 
was a Couch Recidivist. 
</P>
<P>
Did anybody do any studies on whether kids got smarter during the TV writers 
strike? Did SAT scores improve? The lack of TV-as-usual must have had some 
effect. Did IQs go up the way death rates go down during a doctors' strike? 
</P>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Writers Guild for that brief 
time when my family life was enriched. The prolonged strike and the delay of 
the TV season did for our family what good intentions never could. We briefly 
kicked the TV habit. 
</P>
<P>
All that's left now are misty, watercolored memories of how we spent our autumn 
evenings together. My husband lit the fire. He helped our daughter, Emma, with 
high school subjects. When a guy at work asked him what he was going to do that 
night, he said, "I've got geometry and a vocabulary quiz." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of hearing my husband yell, "Would you turn that thing down?" I came 
home one night and actually heard him talking to our child, calling her by the 
affectionate name we had used when she was a baby. He was saying, "OK, Nucky, 
you've got a convex regular polygon, and it's got exterior angles equal to 120 
degrees. What are its interior angles equal to?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I helped daughter Hannah write fourth-grade essays. We read stories 
on a whole range of mythological characters, from Big Foot to the Boogie Man. 
We began caring more about Brer Rabbit than Bugs Bunny, Pecos Bill than Bill 
Cosby, Brer Fox than Michael J. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say we didn't watch TV. We still watched Pee-wee because you 
never know where your next myth is coming from. But there is a difference 
between an alcoholic and someone who takes an occasional drink. An alcoholic 
will drink jug Chablis from a cardboard box with a spigot. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a teleholic will watch anything. I knew I had a serious problem 
during the strike when I saw Benny on "L.A. Law" shredding papers for the third 
time. But when I was still watching "L.A. Law" reruns after the strike, I knew 
I had fallen off the wagon. 
</P>
<P>
How 'bout you? Take the following test to see if you exhibit any of the 17 
Deadly Signs of TV Addiction. Do you . . . 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Ever watch "The Best of Carson"? 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Watch anything before 5 p.m.? 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Watch anything in rerun that you hated the first time? ("Hawaii Five-O" is 
diagnostic.) 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Know more about Roseanne's kids than your own? 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Set your alarm clock so you don't miss Morton Downey Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Feel better now that "HeartBeat" is back? 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Watch any show where the men tell gasoline-shortage jokes, wear polyester 
body shirts and sport mutton-chop sideburns? 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Continue to watch "Moonlighting" now that Dave and Maddie have made it? 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Watch all three network news shows on a day when the lead story is 
"Drifter Shoots Self After Holding Wendy's Patrons Hostage in Small Town in 
North Carolina"? 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Tape any sitcom while watching it? 
</P>
<P>
11 -- Watch UHF stations despite "ghosts" and lack of audio? 
</P>
<P>
12 -- Consume massive amounts of light beer and flavored potato chips? 
</P>
<P>
13 -- Worry about what will happen to Vanna now that Pat Sajak has left? 
</P>
<P>
14 -- Say heavy after a particularly deep "Family Ties"? 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Mentally undress the talking heads on "Washington Week in Review"? 
</P>
<P>
16 -- Watch reruns of the original cast of "Three's Company"? 
</P>
<P>
17 -- Want to see the Cosby family grow up? 
</P>
<P>
If you answered yes to 10 or more of these, you have a TV brain level of 
dangerous proportions. Until the next writers strike forces us all to detox, I 
suggest you seek professional help. Or stay tuned to Philor Oprah for advice on 
how to do brainectomies at home.

MEDICINES AND SURGERY CAN AFFECT CHOLESTEROL TEST RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My doctor told me my cholesterol was high, so he made me come back a 
second time after putting me on a diet. The cholesterol count had dropped. 
Could the diet have made such a change in my cholesterol after only a short 
time? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are a number of possible answers to the question you raise. The 
change in diet may have been responsible for your lower cholesterol level, or 
the laboratory may have provided inaccurate results on one or both occasions. 
The chance of this happening would be greater if the two tests had been done by 
different laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that the the circumstances under which the blood sample was 
drawn may have influenced the results. Certain medications or recent surgery, 
for example, may affect cholesterol readings. Even the fact that a patient is 
standing when a sample is drawn can affect the results. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have heard women who used an IUD say it is the best thing ever, and I've 
heard other women say they tried them and they were horrible. Would you 
recommend use of an IUD? 
</P>
<P>
A: You really answer your own question. An intrauterine device (IUD) may be 
good for some women and not good for others. It is not possible to make a 
general recommendation for or against their use. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that about 6% of women in the United States -- or 2.7 million women 
-- use IUD's, so they and their physicians must find them to be a satisfactory 
means of birth control. However, there are also contraindications to their use, 
including a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and severely painful 
menstruation, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Your question about recommending an IUD for a woman must be answered with 
another question: Which woman? Your own physician will have to answer that in 
your case.

Eleven student screenwriters shared $9,000 in prize money Tuesday afternoon 
when the UCLA Extension Writers Program presented the second annual Diane 
Thomas Screenwriting Awards. First place winner of $5,000 was Susan Vaughn of 
Beverly Hills, a free-lance journalist whose script titled "A Cheerleader's 
Story" is based on the murder of a cheerleader in Marin County a few years ago. 
The second prize of $3,000 went to Alexandra Sokoloff of Los Angeles for "The 
Mindworm." Christine Macgenn of Suisan, Calif., got third place and $1,000 for 
her script titled "Ulysses." Last year's first-place winner, Randi Allison 
Mahem, sold her screenplay, "A 22-Cent Romance," to Orion Pictures for $350,000 
and Dennis Quaid has committed to co-produce and star in it. The awards honor 
Thomas, who studied with the UCLA Extension Writers program in late 1970s and 
wrote the script for the 1984 film "Romancing the Stone." She was later killed 
in a car accident. ALEENE MacMINN

Mayor Bradley is out and Police Chief Darryl Gates is in for a cameo part in an 
upcoming "Hunter" segment on NBC. With Bradley involved in the mayoral 
campaign, his appearance would necessitate equal time for other candidates. 
Though Gates has already filmed the role, NBC faces a similar equal time 
situation should he decide to run for governor. The role: a police chief 
delivering a message about cracking down on crime. ALEENE MacMINN

Three-thousand educators, musicians and music industry representatives will 
gather at the Town and Country Hotel in San Diego Thursday through Sunday to 
take part in the 16th annual National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention. The 
group "works to keep jazz alive in schools, clubs and concert halls around the 
world," says executive director Bill McFarlin. 
</P>
<P>
The convention has scheduled panel discussions, seminars and a wide array of 
performances. Among the artists on tap are Bill Watrous and Charles McPherson, 
Thursday; Red Rodney, Rob McConnell and the world premiere of the "Count Basie 
Jazz History Suite" -- performed by the Count Basie Orchestra, directed by 
Frank Foster, with Joe Williams, narrator -- Friday; and Take Six, Branford 
Marsalis and Michael Brecker, as well as big bands from William Patterson 
College, Berklee College of Music and North Texas State University, Saturday. 
The event is open to the public; concert tickets are $10, available at the 
door, or through Ticketmaster (213) 480-3232. Convention information: (619) 
291-7131.

50 YEARS OF BLUE NOTES: On Jan. 6, 1939, Alfred Lion stepped into a New York 
recording studio for the very first time -- producing "Boogie Woogie Dream" and 
three other songs, with piano giants Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis -- and 
inaugurated his Blue Note Record label. Blue Note is still alive and well half 
a century later, as demonstrated by the its healthy new album and reissue 
release schedule, and its recent signing of such artists as singer Lou Rawls, 
pianist McCoy Tyner and new-on-the-scene tenorman Rick Margipza. 
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the golden anniversary, current Blue Note President Bruce 
Lundvall (Lion, who died in 1987, retired in 1969) hosted a bash at New York's 
Birdland jazz club last Friday, which spotlighted many of the line's top 
artists. "Everyone there was really there to play and kill 'em," Lundvall said. 
"We gave 'em each 15 minutes, which quickly stretched to half an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Lundvall said the high points included a duet on "Stormy Monday" with singers 
Rawls and Dianne Reeves; Margipza, who's just joined Miles Davis' band, "who 
has a totally fresh style, out of Coltrane, but very melodic, which knocked 
everybody out;" and a solo set from Tyner, "that was like a symphony." A 
closing jam session, with guitarists Stanley Jordan and Bireli Lagrene, pianist 
Michel Petrucciani and reedmen Stanley Turrentine and Bobby Watson taking part, 
capped the party. "It was a little bit of jazz heaven and you didn't have to 
die to be there," Lundvall quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Fiftieth anniversary plans include the release of a five-record commemorative 
set in May, and Blue Note Nights during most of the major jazz festivals in the 
United States and Europe this summer. Lineups for these events are not yet 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
BEAT OF A NEW DRUMMER: Terry Lyne Carrington, the 23-year-old drummer who has 
toured with saxophonists Wayne Shorter and David Sanborn, has moved to Los 
Angeles from Manhattan to take the drum chair on the new "Arsenio Hall Show." 
Carrington, who has been performing since she was 7, releases her debut solo 
LP, "Real Life Story" (Verve Forecast) -- featuring such notables as guitarists 
Carlos Santana, Hiram Bullock and John Scofield, saxmen Grover Washington, Jr. 
and Gerald Albright and singer Dianne Reeves -- in late February. 
</P>
<P>
AROUND TOWN: Pianist George Gaffney, while a most talented player, isn't 
exactly what you'd call a "name" musician. But he might be, at least here in 
Los Angeles, if he weren't on the road so much. He's usually backing Sarah 
Vaughan, though he recently spent five days working with Frank Sinatra at the 
Circle Star Theatre in San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
And while Gaffney -- a transplanted New Yorker who's been playing behind the 
Divine One steadily since 1980 -- said the job with Vaughan is "wonderful, 
because she's so musical," he tries to get exposure on his own "by working as 
much as I can when I'm in town." 
</P>
<P>
Featured on occasional gigs with small groups led by Bill Berry and Sal 
Marquez, Gaffney is his own boss at Linda's on Melrose Avenue, where he and 
bassist Eric Von Essen hold forth most Fridays and Saturdays. The two offer an 
"eclectic assortment, anything from jazz standards by Monk and Strayhorn to 
very old tunes, like Gershwin's 'Do It Again' ," said the pianist who named Bud 
Powell, Bill Evans and Tyner as his chief inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
When not playing, Gaffney composes and orchestrates -- he was nominated for an 
Emmy in 1987 for a musical sequence he contributed to "Moonlighting" and he 
often orchestrates tunes for Rita Moreno. The pianist has no recordings out 
under his own name, but he's in no hurry. "I trust that'll fall into place in 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENT AND CHOICE ALBUMS: "The Harper Brothers" (Verve) debuts a sparkling, 
young Manhattan-based quintet that embraces the best of '50s mainstream 
qualities without sounding dated. Trumpeter Philip Harper and pianist Stephen 
Scott are standouts, as "Mogie," "Haitian March" and others show, but really 
everybody in this band shines on a prime session where the cooking never stops. 
. . . Local guitarist Carl Verheyen's "No Border" (Chase Music Group) is 
rock-meets-jazz with no apologies. There's complexity ("Gretchen's Theme"), 
blow-it-out wailing ("Highland Shuffle") and simple sweetness ("Big Sur"). 
Verheyen appears Thursday at At My Place in Santa Monica.

'FINISH LINE' EXPLORES STEROID USE, ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Finish Line," airing at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. today on cable's new TNT network, 
uses the hot issue of steroids to explore the down side of competition and the 
obsession with being first in sports and all of life. 
</P>
<P>
A formerly brilliant high school sprinter who is driven to excel by his highly 
competitive architect father, young Glen Shrevelowe is barely surviving on the 
collegiate level, and is drawn into using body-enhancing steroids -- first 
pills, then injections -- with tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Brolin and his real-life father, James Brolin, give affecting performances 
as the Shrevelowes, and "Finish Line" nicely defines the perils of steroids and 
the competitive and societal pressures underlying their use. But Glen's demise 
is accelerated so dramatically -- and with such a heavy hand by writer Norman 
Morrill and director John Nicolella -- that "Finish Line" assumes a somewhat 
unreal aura that undercuts its effectiveness. HOWARD ROSENBERG

'SMOKING': THE MESSAGE IS LOUD AND CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is another 30 minutes on television about the dangers of smoking really 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, if "Smoking: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know" (10:30 tonight 
on HBO cable) has its facts straight. Among its assertions: that 50% of 
American women are unaware that there are dangers to smoking while pregnant, 
and that the tobacco industry needs 1,000 new smokers a day -- recruited mainly 
from the young, of course -- to replace the 1,000 people who die every day from 
tobacco-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Premiering on the 25th anniversary of U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry's 1964 
report linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer, the half-hour is a 
straightforward but concise and vibrantly produced presentation of the case 
against tobacco, with the attack led by current Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett 
Koop. 
</P>
<P>
Without resorting to gross-out scare tactics (like the blackened lungs many of 
us were shown in high school films), the program hammers home the message that 
cigarettes kill. 
</P>
<P>
The show focuses on one particular cancer victim but is enlivened by comments 
from smokers and non-smokers, and by funny and chilling '50s TV ads for 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
It is flawed only by some heavy-handed, droning synthesizer music and Koop's 
gung-ho attitude. The surgeon general sometimes seems willing to cloud anything 
even minutely positive about tobacco consumption when he addresses the question 
of pipe and cigar smoking by beginning in this confusing manner: "I think a lot 
of people kid themselves into thinking it's safer to smoke a pipe or cigar than 
a cigarette. It's true that they are not as dangerous as cigarettes but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Huh? 
</P>
<P>
But the essential message here comes across loud and clear, and maybe it's a 
message that isn't being heard by young people amid all the Just Say No-mania 
over far less lethal drugs. If you smoke cigarettes or are considering trying 
the habit, consider the program's final fact: 
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, heroin, crack, cocaine, 
alcohol, car accidents, fire and murder combined." TERRY ATKINSON

PEER REVIEW REVISITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though it had sailed through the California Legislature with strong 
support, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed medical peer-review legislation last 
autumn and urged further negotiations to produce a law more widely acceptable 
to the professionals whom it would affect. He did the right thing, and his 
proposal is being pursued. 
</P>
<P>
This is a complex and difficult subject because of the risks of abuse. On 
occasion, physicians have used peer review to exclude others who would be 
competitive. There are glaring examples in which disciplinary action has been 
delayed because of the unwillingness of some doctors to report incompetence on 
the part of others. An effective and fair system of peer review is essential to 
maintaining quality on hospital medical staffs. 
</P>
<P>
California already has in place one of the best peer-review laws in the nation, 
and it is working reasonably well. Unless a new law is adopted, however, there 
is a possibility that the provisions of the state law will be preempted by 
federal rules taking effect next October. Even if the federal law does not 
preempt state law, it will open the way for unnecessary litigation in the 
federal courts. The state will benefit from maintaining its own laws, which can 
be fine-tuned in Sacramento, with disputes settled in state rather than federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The California Medical Assn., representing most of the state's doctors, was the 
prime mover for the legislation that the governor vetoed. The California Assn. 
of Hospitals and Health Systems, which was officially neutral when the final 
version of the CMA bill was adopted last fall, is convinced now that existing 
case and statutory law in California is adequate. But it is open to 
consultations, and agrees that the effect of the new federal law could pose 
problems next October. 
</P>
<P>
In those circumstances, representatives of both the medical association and the 
hospitals and health-systems group have agreed to sit down this month and try 
to work out the kind of consensus urged by the governor. That is a good 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
It will serve at least to put aside some misunderstandings that have haunted 
the medical association's bill from the start. At least some of the opposition 
to it has been based on incorrect information. For example, the bill would not, 
as some opponents have said, mandate that lawyers participate at each stage of 
peer review. Indeed, lawyers are excluded from initial phases unless hospitals 
and their medical staffs should make special provision. Many doctors are 
concerned that professional medical relationships would be broken if each phase 
of peer review became a legal confrontation. Provisions of the CMA bill for 
discovery, setting forth what information would have to be provided to the 
physicians under review, are now being refined to limit the risk that these 
could be an invitation to what lawyers call fishing expeditions -- an 
uncontrolled search for information. The burden of proof, which rests with the 
physicians when seeking to join a medical staff but with the medical staff and 
hospital when seeking to discipline an individual, seems reasonable enough. But 
those who drafted the earlier legislation acknowledge its extraordinary 
complexity, and that may be a cause in itself to set sights for clearer and 
simpler rules. 
</P>
<P>
The key task, it seems to us, is to preserve California's discretion over this 
matter. The best way to do that is through compromise among the doctors and 
hospitals so that a fair system -- but a forceful system, with protections 
against abuse -- is the result.

JUDICIAL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Overprotected Judiciary," Dec. 29) concerning the shields 
erected by judges to safeguard themselves against public criticism is not only 
very well taken, but it hardly goes far enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Judicial Performance is not merely inadequate, it is 
incompetent, for the reason that it merely responds to criticisms (and 
criticisms from mere citizens count for nothing). The commission does nothing 
to maintain a standard of quality. It should patrol the courts and weed out 
incompetent judges. The way things work now, each judge is a law unto himself, 
with very little recourse for his victims. A judge can violate more laws in a 
year than a professional criminal can in a lifetime. And no one can do anything 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
But, indeed, you must get after the federal courts. These judges cannot be 
replaced no matter how incompetent they might be. Inevitably they are even 
worse than state judges, for they really are above the law. It is human nature 
that meek, considerate persons become curmudgeons when the President anoints 
them with the gift of infallibility. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vestige of "the divine rights of kings" and it should end!

MIRACLE BEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story about Jean-Pierre Hallet, winner of the 1987 Presidential End Hunger 
Award and his "miracle" winged bean seeds (Metro, Dec. 18) reminds me of a 
cartoon called "The Shmoo" created by Al Capp of Dogpatch fame. One day Li'l 
Abner wandered into a hidden canyon (the Valley of the Shmoon) and discovered 
these amazing and prolific little animals who, with the slightest urging, could 
lay dairy-fresh eggs, give the finest creamy butter and Grade A milk, make 
yummy steaks and, when fried, they taste just like chicken -- and all white 
meat. Their skins even make excellent leather or cloth, depending how thick you 
slice it. Nothing is wasted: even their eyes make splendid suspender buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Hallet's end-hunger campaign, based on his fast-growing, drought-resistant 
soybean-like legume, has not met with much success despite the fact that the 
U.S. Academy of Sciences called it a "supermarket on a stalk." Its leaves are 
like Vitamin A-enriched spinach, the shoots like asparagus, the flowers like 
mushrooms, the young pods like snow peas and the tubers like potatoes. The 
protein-rich brown seeds can be roasted like peanuts, processed into milk or 
ground into flour. 
</P>
<P>
Al Capp's Shmoo was eventually done in by misguided opponents. Hallet, however, 
should not be discouraged and must keep up the good fight. His product has 
deeper roots.

CIGARETTE TAX TAKES EFFECT

<TEXT>
<P>
So Brown, the 48-year-old paralegal described in the article, is seeing his 
effort of fighting against legislators and local officials going up in smoke 
following the passage of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says that Proposition 99 is "a form of extortion," singling out a group 
of people in our society. He states that we might as well tax red meats, using 
the money to fight heart disease; and tax candy because it leads to obesity. 
</P>
<P>
We could just as well attribute Brown's 1 1/2-pack-a-day intake to occasional 
cerebral failure. Think about it, Tom. When was the last time a candy eater 
jeopardized the health of the non-candy eaters in the same room? When have 
non-red meat eaters in a restaurant been gagged by the presence of nearby red 
meat eating patrons, as well as seeing windows clouded as a result of the meat? 
And, of course, let's remember that a scavenger hunt's easiest obstacle is to 
find a crushed cigarette butt, wrapper, or box -- they're on the ground 
practically anywhere you look. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago it was predicted that smoking will be "non-acceptable in society" 
in a decade. Nonsmokers have taken great strides to see that this dream comes 
true.

SENDING STALIN TO SIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For months a special Soviet commission has been poring over records from the 
1930s, reviewing the charges of treason and other high crimes brought against 
hundreds of old Bolsheviks who were executed at Josef Stalin's command. Many of 
the most prominent officials convicted during the infamous purge trials have 
now been exonerated, with the accusations that cost them their lives dismissed 
as fabrications. But for every major figure who was forced to confess to 
imaginary crimes by Stalin's torturers, tens of thousands of ordinary Soviet 
citizens also suffered. Now, as part of the reform effort to shed greater light 
on the Soviet Union's dark and bloody past, the Communist Party's Central 
Committee has proposed the mass rehabilitation of these victims. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a blanket reversal of convictions was probably prompted as much by 
administrative need as by the pleas of the surviving purge victims and their 
families. So enormous was the number of those arrested and condemned to quick 
execution or deadly servitude in the vast Siberian penal empire that reviewing 
their cases on an individual basis would likely take centuries. Those who felt 
the worst of the terror have been clamoring for recognition and fitting 
memorials. It appears that they may soon get both. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet historians, meanwhile, are starting to ask that the archives of the 
period be opened. Even now there are only informed estimates about the number 
of people killed or condemned to slave labor during decades of terror. Western 
experts, using census figures and what is known of the size of various penal 
camps, put the number of those affected at anywhere between 7 and 23 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was the practice of the secret police to arrest someone, force him to name 
eight or ten other supposed anti-state conspirators, and then force the new 
arrestees to implicate still others. The number of victims thus came to expand 
geometrically. In time, suggests Robert Conquest, the foremost Western 
historian of the great terror, the frightful logic of the purges would have led 
to the arrest of every Soviet citizen. And so the terror came to be restricted 
-- though it never disappeared, continuing until Stalin's death in 1953. The 
pain that it still evokes among ordinary Russians is evident. That a system not 
noted for its sensitivity to popular suffering feels compelled now to try to 
address that pain is significant.

After reading Sherry Potter's letter ("Reward", Jan.5) concerning lost wallets 
and rewards, I'd like to describe my own recent experience. While on jury duty 
in Glendale in December, I visited the main Pasadena City Library and found a 
wallet (filled with driver's license and other valuable cards) in the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
I drove over to the owner's address and left a note with my name and telephone 
under his door. When I returned to my parked car, I discovered a $20 parking 
ticket on my windshield. I drove over to Pasadena City Hall and paid the 
ticket. Two days later, the owner of the wallet telephoned and I mailed the 
lost wallet back to his Pasadena address. Lo and behold, the owner( Michael 
Ackley) sent a letter of thanks and enclosed a $25 check to cover the $20 
parking ticket and my expenses.

DEUKMEJIAN MAKES HIS MARK AS PERSON FIRST, POLITICIAN SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PEACE, Steve Peace, a Democrat, is a member of the California Assembly 
from Chula Vista. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What would happen if one morning a normal everyday person, one with no pretense 
for glory or obsession for grand accomplishment, woke to discover that he had 
been elected the governor of California? 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years we have been finding out. Last Thursday, however, Gov. 
George Deukmejian, characteristically choosing the needs of his family over the 
demands of other politicians, announced that he would not seek a third term. By 
now his choice should have come as no surprise. Yet many politicians seemed 
stunned. They had misread Deukmejian once agian. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most in public life, Deukmejian has managed to remain a person first and 
a politician second. For hardened politicians and political analysts alike, 
this has always been a source of great confusion. 
</P>
<P>
His critics, for example, often decry the governor's alleged lack of "vision." 
They forget that by 1982, the year he was elected to his first term, 
Californians had grownso weary of the "farsightedness" of Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr. that Deukmejian's new look at "common sense" became the very birth child of 
Brown's "vision." 
</P>
<P>
It was calculated public relations. Where Brown dreamed of a California space 
program, the Duke would build highways. This "common sense" theme would 
continue to work for Deukmejian over the years because it was consistent with 
the man who embraced it. 
</P>
<P>
The governor sought to implement values with which the great majority of voting 
Californians identified. It was a language that people in the real world could 
understand. But it went right over the heads of many within the political 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's reputation for being inflexible has also been nurtured by his 
fellow politicians' failure to recognize and deal with him as a real person. 
When Deukmejian sensed that support was being withheld from an otherwise 
meritorious proposal in an effort to win concessions on unrelated issues, he 
was appalled, just as any other honest citizen would have been. And when he 
said "no" he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, has been very confusing to a political world accustomed to 
winning and losing for reasons unrelated to merit -- a world in which "no" 
means "what do you have to offer?" and "yes" means "you owe me one." 
</P>
<P>
His ability to put a premium on human, rather than political, motives 
ultimately became one of the governor's greatest weapons. Legislators have 
repeatedly misfired in their attempt to figure out "what the governor really 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
These same values, however, have also caused problems. His very human desire 
never to be embarrassed by a veto over-ride has given right-wing Republicans a 
tremendous amount of leverage over the governor. Indeed, in the Assembly, many 
of the Deukmejian's most significant legislative initiatives -- beginning with 
the 1982 financial plan to wipe out the deficit left over from the Brown 
Administration -- have encountered their most significant opposition from 
within the Republican caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's relationship with Senate Democrats has been more strained. This 
may be due in part to the Senate's responsibility for confirmation of 
gubernatorial appointments and Deukmejian's tendency to view "political" 
appointments as a very personal affair. 
</P>
<P>
More subtly, his own staffing decisions may also have served to reinforce 
already held views rather than to challenge and expand the governor's exposure 
to new ideas. His respect for the formal hierarchy of the process has also 
precluded him from dealing around the legislative leadership to work one-on-one 
with legislators. This has made it almost impossible for him to build any sort 
of semi-permanent working majority. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, his sense of personal responsibility has meant that "only the governor 
speaks for the governor." Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, with more than two 
decades of legislative involvement, has said that this is the only 
Administration that he has encountered in which no one other than the governor 
himself had any authority to make commitments of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has surely derived a great deal of satisfaction in having 
successfully implemented many of his "common sense" goals, despite the 
frustration of having fallen short on others. However, in his press conference 
last week Deukmejian suggested that he'd like to take a "shot at the moon" 
himself over the next two years. This just goes to show that even those most 
solidly rooted to the reality of the present dream of the future. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Deukmejian will pursue his vision as the same normal, everyday person 
he has always been. It might be interesting to find out what would happen if 
120 normal, everyday men and women woke one morning to discover that they had 
been elected to the California Legislature and been given two years to share 
their most private hopes and dreams with "Good Ol' George." 
</P>
<P>
Together they just might discover a shared vision of the future that might 
include the soft echo of our children's voices in a quiet but sincere chorus of 
"Thank you."

2ND DEFENDANT VANISHES IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are seeking a Glendale man who failed to appear Tuesday for a court 
hearing on charges that he stole more than $1 million from a Woodland Hills 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Edward Miller, 27, was to have attended a preliminary hearing on 
charges that he joined in a scheme to embezzle claims funds from Allianz 
Insurance Company. Van Nuys Municipal Judge Beauford M. Phelps issued an arrest 
warrant after Miller failed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also are searching for Miller's co-defendant, Michael Lynn Duncan, 
37, of West Hollywood, who pleaded guilty Nov. 2 to embezzlement but failed to 
appear for his sentencing Dec. 19, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stuart C. Lytton. 
Duncan faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
None of the $1 million has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Duncan's failure to appear in December, prosecutors did not fear that 
Miller also had fled. Lytton said Miller seemed cooperative and had appeared 
for all his previous court hearings, including his most recent, Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Thom Tibor, said he had not spoken to 
his client recently but would not say when their last conversation occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, a former claims supervisor at Allianz, set up phony insurance claims 
under the names of numerous real and fictitious people, Lytton said. Between 
Dec. 3, 1984, and Nov. 20, 1987, Duncan issued more than 200 claim checks for 
amounts as high as $10,000, then cashed the checks himself, Lytton said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said some checks were issued in Miller's name and others were in 
his bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was discovered during a company audit in February, 1988. Miller was 
arrested May 13 and was free from jail on his own recognizance. Duncan was 
arrested June 6 and was free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also is charged with embezzlement and faces up to five years in prison 
if convicted.

BACKERS 'LET CITY TAKE LEAD' IN WAKE OF CHLORINE LEAK; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INITIATIVE CAMPAIGN SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of an initiative that would require Simi Valley to regulate hazardous 
materials have agreed to stop campaigning for the measure while city officials 
work to prevent a recurrence of last week's chlorine gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
Paul La Bonte, a spokesman for Help End Local Pollution, said the homeowner 
group decided not to gather signatures in support of the measure after meeting 
Sunday with city officials. The meeting was convened at HELP's request, La 
Bonte said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've conceded to let the city take the lead on this issue, although we can 
always reintroduce the initiative if we're not satisfied," La Bonte said. "But 
I don't think that's going to happen because the City Council has a real sense 
of urgency about getting tough on toxics after what happened last week." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a square-mile cloud of chlorine gas leaked from a tank at the 
Travelin' West Textiles plant on Easy Street, forcing the evacuation of more 
than 12,000 people for almost 12 hours. Twenty people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has "emphasized the need to do something about toxics sooner than 
later," Councilwoman Vicky Howard said. An ad-hoc committee, appointed by the 
council last summer to review permit and inspection procedures for businesses 
that use hazardous materials, will hold its first meeting Jan. 18, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council expects a report from the committee "as soon as possible" on 
ways to strengthen local control over the storage and use of toxic substances, 
Howard said. The committee is made up of Councilwoman Ann Rock, a planning 
commissioner, a Chamber of Commerce representative and two residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable we'll hire some sort of specialist to inspect businesses," 
Councilman Glen McAdoo said. 
</P>
<P>
But the specialist would not replace inspectors from the Ventura County Fire 
Protection District, responsible under state law for inspecting businesses that 
use hazardous materials, McAdoo said. 
</P>
<P>
About 460 Simi Valley businesses use toxic substances, said Bob Holoway, 
district deputy chief. 
</P>
<P>
The council has also appointed Howard and Rock to investigate the cause of 
Thursday's accident. Ventura County fire officials have said they suspect that 
employees of Olympic Chemical Co., an Orange County firm hired to remove 
chlorine from the tank, failed to completely close a valve. 
</P>
<P>
The tank will be removed this week by Olympic Chemical, which leased it to 
Travelin' West, Battalion Chief Dick Perry said. The leak occurred as Travelin' 
West was closing after a long legal fight with the city over the dumping of 
dyes and chemicals into the sewer system, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
La Bonte praised the City Council's response to Thursday's incident and said 
HELP's initiative appears unnecessary. The initiative -- drafted last summer 
after residents complained about odors emitted by a spa manufacturer -- calls 
for the city to establish a program to regulate the use and storage of 
hazardous materials by businesses. Funding was to come from fees levied on the 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would have required the signatures of 6,667 residents -- 15% of 
the city's voters.

COUNTY OKS STUDIES FOR OFF-ROAD VEHICLE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved spending 
$233,690 to conduct final studies for a controversial park for off-road 
vehicles in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A master plan and an environmental impact report will be prepared for the 
proposed 606-acre park in the rugged Whitney Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The site is two miles north of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeway 
interchange, which is in a sparsely populated area. But the proposed park site 
is not remote enough for two prominent neighbors -- the Placerita Canyon Nature 
Center and a Walt Disney Co. film location ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a group that lends support to the county-operated nature center said 
they are heartsick about the proposal, which they said would destroy one of the 
last remaining oak woodlands in Southern California and increase off-road 
vandalism in the nature center. Disney executives have expressed concern that 
the noise from the park would jeopardize filming at the Golden Oak Ranch, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disheartened," said Linda Larsen, president of Placerita Nature 
Center Associates, which has vowed to continue to fight the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kerstetter, executive vice president at Walt Disney Studios, said Disney's 
sound tests indicate that the park and the film ranch could not coexist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to us, with tests we have run, the type of activity that could 
normally be expected in that off-road vehicle park would render the use of 
highly sensitive sound equipment for motion pictures and television almost 
pointless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the opposition, Jo Anne Darcy, field deputy for Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, said that the proposed $17-million vehicle park, to be funded by 
the state, would be scrapped if it proves environmentally hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Owner's Blow 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key in this whole issue is just because the county approved going 
after the grant money, doesn't mean it's a fait accompli," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The project might have received its biggest blow from the property's owner. On 
Tuesday, Darcy said that Jack Albert told her he was surprised to learn that 
the county wants his land for an off-road park. Darcy quoted Albert as saying 
he is not interested in selling. 
</P>
<P>
Albert could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Riders of dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles have been clamoring for a new 
place to ride since the only park in the area, Indian Dunes Park, was closed in 
1984. County parks officials have said that establishing a new park is 
imperative because many off-road enthusiasts now ride illegally in other areas, 
causing police, fire and noise problems. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, angry homeowners protested when the county proposed using two 
sites in the Agua Dulce area as parks for off-road vehicles. Residents argued 
that the parks would be noisy, environmentally destructive and a traffic 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The two sites, which were ultimately rejected, had been among about 50 
potential spots selected by Los Angeles County's Off-Highway Vehicle Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The county then selected Whitney Canyon and Rowher Flat in the Angeles National 
Forest for consideration. The county explored enlarging Rowher Flat, which is 
already designated as an off-road vehicle site, but concluded that U.S. Forest 
Service regulations would preclude a major expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon park would include eight miles of riding trails, two 20-acre 
motocross tracks, an amphitheater for club meetings and parking for 1,000 
vehicles, said Clyde H. Von Rosenberg, a county parks planning assistant. The 
park's trails would be linked to the off-road trails in the Angeles National 
Forest. The county would prefer that a private concessionaire operate the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study will take seven months to finish, officials said. The 
earliest the park could be completed, if approved by the supervisors, is the 
summer of 1991, they said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: A DAMKEEPER'S HOUSEWORK IS NEVER DONE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. W. McGARRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Bermel is not talkative. That's probably good. Life is lonely in a 
zillion-ton sentry box, where Bermel spends much of his time. A gregarious type 
might have gone bonkers long ago. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, Bermel has been the lone keeper of the Sepulveda Dam. A 
ruddy-faced 55-year-old with silvered hair, he figures on "another seven to 10 
years," before asking the federal government for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The dam is a sort of soldier, standing tall in the middle of the San Fernando 
Valley. Like most soldiers, it tends to be ignored when not desperately needed, 
or else resented as a brutish intruder. The dam just northwest of the 
intersection of the San Diego and Ventura freeways rises 57 feet high out of 
the parkland and golf course like a bulldozer at a tea party. The miles of 
concrete-lined channels that feed its flood-control system form a network of 
Frankenstein sutures on a pretty suburban face. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for them sounds almost comical in the usually dry Valley: They're 
a defense against too much rain. 
</P>
<P>
But before the system went to work in 1941, rainfall brought devastation. The 
now tame river had an annoying habit of carving a new channel with every 
sizable storm, rolling through houses and fields. Spanish padres complained of 
destructive floods in the 18th Century. In the 19th Century, floodwaters rolled 
massive boulders into farming hamlets and swept away railroad bridges. 
</P>
<P>
In 1916, 1934 and 1938, floods washed through truck farms and the first 
suburban homes. Van Nuys Boulevard submerged like a submarine. What 
uncontrolled floods like these would do to the densely populated condo blocks 
of today is sobering to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly enough for a sentry, the U.S. Army built and runs the dam, an 
unmilitary responsibility rooted in Thomas Jefferson's mistrust of a standing 
army. As president, Jefferson figured he could prevent the soldiery from 
bashing republican institutions, then the military fashion in Europe, by 
keeping them busy at odd jobs like dredging rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Bermel's tiny office inside the dam is about 6 feet square, painted in Seabee 
gray. A steel federal-issue desk fills more than half of it. 
</P>
<P>
One floor below is an enormous workroom, basic Fuehrer bunker in style, almost 
empty except for a relic of the Civil Defense era, a drum marked "SK IV 
SANITATION KIT supplies 50 persons." 
</P>
<P>
Below that is five stories of empty, a dank cavern of concrete that feels 
subterranean despite its height. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter and summer, it's always the same temperature -- too cold," says Bermel. 
"You can clap your hands down here and count to eight before the echoes stop." 
</P>
<P>
No pictures are allowed inside the dam, Bermel said, "because of the danger 
from terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Can he really imagine Khomeini dispatching a band of murder-eyed fanatics with 
the words: "We will bring the Great Satan to its knees, brothers; we will blow 
up . . . (dramatic pause) . . . Sepulveda Dam! (Evil chuckle, evil chuckle)"? 
</P>
<P>
He's following orders, Bermel replies. That's usually a wise career move if you 
work for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
He spends little time in the windowless cell of an office, he says, showing a 
visitor the spectacular view from the top of the dam. A damkeeper's housework 
is never done -- painting, hauling trash, chasing out trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
The dam attracts a plague of graffiti-trolls, apparently because it's the 
biggest object they can deface, the Mt. Everest of vandalism. He fights them as 
best he can. He particularly objects to "vulgar stuff about the President and 
the Vice President -- I get that off right away, even if I have to roll 50 
gallons of paint over it." 
</P>
<P>
And there is always the work of turning on and off the Los Angeles River, 
sending water down the 43-mile channel to the Pacific. Usually there is only a 
trickle in the 50-foot-wide main channel at the dam. This week, even after 
months of occasional rain, it was only 10 inches deep. That can change quickly, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the runoff from 152 square miles. When rain falls on Chatsworth it 
starts showing up here in 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the concrete river teems with fish. "We get some big catfish in the 
spring." When water is released suddenly, fish are left behind, stranded and 
flopping, along with "rattlesnakes that wash down out of the hills -- some of 
them 6-footers. I don't go down there then." 
</P>
<P>
In a heavy storm, the dam holds back runoff that would otherwise pour 
downstream into Los Angeles. If the dam ever filled to capacity, the lake would 
submerge the park behind it all the way to Balboa Boulevard, more than a mile 
away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never even come close to capacity," he said. But in rainy years, water 
routinely closes Burbank Boulevard, sometimes stranding motorists who drive 
into 4-foot-deep water at night. "I call the police and Fire Department to get 
them out. But it's been dry lately. We haven't flooded Burbank Boulevard in at 
least three or four years now." 
</P>
<P>
What if the dam filled beyond its capacity? 
</P>
<P>
Some spillways would open automatically, and he'd have to open the gates, which 
would send "a wall of water 500 feet wide and about 11 feet high" toward the 
intersection of the two freeways, Bermel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would probably take out the interchange." His forehead furrowed. Bermel, a 
quiet man who seems comfortable in his solitary job, hopes that retirement 
arrives before any storm like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, the Army Corps of Engineers gives me an updated list with the 
telephone numbers of all the people we'd have to call before I did that. 
There's about 100 numbers on it now. It would be a whole lot of trouble."

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: THINGS GOT GURGLING AT ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unseen hands, hidden in the second-floor gallery, gently tugged at the ropes 
attached to the circular curtain that dominated the rotunda of the San Diego 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
The blue cloth cocoon resisted for a moment before floating upward to reveal 
the triple-tiered fountain that is the centerpiece of the newly named John M. 
and Sally B. Thornton Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
This event actually occurred twice last week, at Thursday's formal dedication 
of the fountain and rotunda and at the lavish gala given Saturday by the 
Thorntons for 340 guests. On both occasions, the guests uncorked an 
appreciative murmur that gave some participants the sensation that they had 
been plunged into a vat of champagne. The feeling was reinforced by the flutes 
of champagne that the crowd raised in a double toast to the Thorntons and the 
fountain. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's dedication, museum President Joseph Hibben told the 90 in 
attendance that "some of you may find this fountain similar to that at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art (in New York). We would like to be more and more 
like the Met." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Thornton took a lighthearted tone as she threw the switch that sent water 
bubbling up through the fountain's pipes. "I threatened to put goldfish in the 
basins -- and maybe I will," she teased. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at both events hurriedly searched trouser pockets and handbags for coins 
to toss into the fountain's brightly tiled pool; Dolly Maw got there first with 
a newly minted penny. At the gala, bits of unusual lore and surprising 
observations made the rounds. It seems, for example, that the Chinese hold 
that, if a borrowed coin is deposited in a fountain, the good luck goes to the 
person who lent it. And then there is the case of the martini-glass-shaped 
tiles in the pool's floor; Charles Melville counted them and noted that it 
takes exactly 10 to describe a 90-degree arc in the pool's circumference. 
</P>
<P>
The Thorntons gave the gala as another highlight in a relationship with the 
museum that dates back to John's membership on the board of trustees in the 
early 1970s and which has become more pronounced in recent years with their 
sponsorship of such exhibits as "American Masters: The Thyssen-Bornemisza 
Collection" in 1985 and the 1987 presentation of "American Women Artists, 
1830-1930." Sally serves as vice president of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably in deference to the fountain, the Thorntons took pains to ensure 
that Saturday's gala was one of the splashiest in the museum's history. Because 
of the rotunda's Spanish-Italian architecture, the evening took on a 
predominantly Spanish theme in such details as the tableau vivant of Spanish 
dancers who posed, with a guitarist, on the grand staircase. Later, flamenco 
dancers made the rounds between sets by the party's two bands. Women dressed to 
the eyebrows; Vicki Rogers assessed the situation neatly by stating, "When 
you're invited to one of Sally's parties, you know you'd better gussie up." 
</P>
<P>
The museum itself was dressed up for the occasion, with dinner tables centered 
by fountain-like floral arrangements that overflowed with red and pink blooms. 
The sheer size of the crowd dictated that dinner seating be spread through the 
American Gallery, the Asian Court, Gallery 12 and Copley Auditorium; guests in 
each room dined on an elaborate menu of wild mushroom ravioli and roast rack of 
lamb. 
</P>
<P>
The menu was accompanied by three types of champagne from Temecula's Culbertson 
Winery, in which the Thorntons hold an interest. The same champagne will be 
poured at the gala that will follow the presidential inauguration of George 
Bush, an event at which a number of the guests at Saturday's event will be 
present. Among them will be banker (and former museum President) Gordon Luce 
and his wife, Karon; Ruth Carpenter; and Dorene and John Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Steven Brezzo found himself hard-pressed to describe the gala. 
"The scale of the evening is unprecedented," he said. He had high praise for 
the hosts. "The fountain is a fitting testimony to the Thorntons' magnificent 
enthusiasm and generosity, not only for the museum, but for the arts in San 
Diego in general."

<P>
PERSONAL MOMENTS WITH ALICE WALKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Walker is unexpected -- simpler, smaller and far more understated than 
one anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Her works are so strong in their convictions, so self-assured and direct in 
their statements, that to find them emanating from an imperturbable slender 
woman, her corn rows lightly brushing girlish shoulders, comes as a vast 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that was precisely the impression received Monday, when this poet and 
novelist, who won a Pulitzer Prize for "The Color Purple," put in an appearance 
at the Los Angeles Theatre Center as part of the center's ongoing poetry 
series. Making it happen, said series producer Alan Mandel in his introduction, 
took three years of relentless pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It took three years," Walker said when she came on, "because some things take 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was not facetious, defensive or playful, but evenhanded -- a key 
to the woman before us who, in the next 80 minutes offered not only poetry and 
prose from her own collections (published and to be published), but just such 
tempered wisdom as well. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed by the bombed-out set for the center's current production of "Stars in 
the Morning Sky" on which she stood, Walker diligently, but without hurry, set 
about the task at hand. Within seconds, the background was forgotten. Her 
informal mix of earthiness and ethereality flooded the room. 
</P>
<P>
By way of introducing herself to the packed auditorium, she read the only poem 
printed in the program: "How Poems Are Made/A Discredited View." It was as much 
a personal credo as a springboard from which the evening would take off, with 
its other poems, prose passages and candid sharing of selective information 
("poetry is so difficult, but at the same time, I was saving my life when I 
wrote"). 
</P>
<P>
Walker took her audience through excerpts from her "Revolutionary Petunias" (a 
collection of poems), spoke of growing up in Eatonton, Ga., with her brothers 
and sisters and making a choice in her late teens between going to West Africa 
or moving to Mississippi. "On the morning that I was going to Senegal, I went 
to Jackson and stayed there for seven years," she said, important years, during 
which she became a woman and began to see this different South with new eyes. 
</P>
<P>
She invited us to share her losses with the same curious mix of passion and 
detachment that she had applied in writing (and now reading) about them, 
telling us of her sister, Molly, "who, in the '50s, left us . . ." and the 
burial of her father's grandmother ("Not pretty, but serviceable, a hard 
worker," who mothered seven children). "I cried," she said, reading, "not for 
the dead, but for the memories . . . seen from the angle of her death." 
</P>
<P>
There was humor in a light poem about the challenge of exercise and, among 
other work, fleeting but telling references to herself (". . . me, destined to 
be wayward . . .") or the larger womanist self ("I am the woman dark, repaired, 
healed . . ." who brings two flowers with twin roots: Justice and Hope, Hope 
and Justice.) 
</P>
<P>
Walker's selections, much like her books, seemed made to instruct by 
indirection. There were statements that half-qualified as confessions but never 
went too far. "Expect nothing," she had read from another poem. "Live frugally 
on surprises. Be nobody's darling. Be an outcast. Be pleased to walk alone. 
Uncool." 
</P>
<P>
This is an artist who values her insularity and carefully guards her mystery. 
She tells enough to startle, never to satiate. 
</P>
<P>
Her poem "The Mornings of Rain," for example, was written, she confessed, to 
celebrate the rebirth of her ability to create poetry after a longish period of 
drought; "First They Said," an amusing litany of complaints against all black 
people with a serious twist ending, is Walker's own humorous but sober comment 
on bigotry everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
For a change of pace and tone (and dialect), she read from "The Color Purple": 
Celie's letter to her sister Nettie about giving up writing to God. The evening 
ended with two passages from her just-finished novel, "The Temple of My 
Familiar" (to be published in May), which Walker described as covering 500,000 
years of history and mystery, a book "about remembering and trusting your own 
innate ability . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The first segment was a wife's seriocomic effort to divorce her husband while 
still wanting to remain with him in an unmarried state that she considers "more 
fun." The second picks up on "Color Purple's" Shug after Celie's death. It 
seems Shug found religion and wrote a "Gospel According to Shug." As Walker 
dispensed its meticulous, eloquent invocations, it became clear that this was 
also a gospel according to Alice. 
</P>
<P>
Why do people love to listen to poets reading their own works? Is it because 
the poet, like the groundhog, tends to remain elusive? Is it a quest for 
demystification? Some poets -- though not Alice Walker who reads her work like 
an angel -- don't even do it very well. It boils down to something simpler: 
Knowing the words and wanting to know the person; loving the words and wanting 
to "touch" the person. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Joseph Campbell wrote about "finding your bliss," he was being 
neither coy nor deliberately obscure. He knew it was a thing one would innately 
recognize -- either in oneself upon achieving it, or when one came across it in 
someone else who had. 
</P>
<P>
The lucky people who saw Walker on Monday were in the presence of a woman who, 
at least momentarily, had found her "bliss." She stood at the radiant epicenter 
of her being where everything becomes possible -- and touched us all.

Exhibition planners in Hartford, Conn., went out on a limb in hanging a 
familiar painting by Georgia O'Keeffe upside-down from its usual position, but 
a curator says that's what the artist wanted. The Wadsworth Atheneum owns the 
1929 painting, "The Lawrence Tree," and hung it with the tree extending from 
the lower right-hand corner of the canvas. However, the painting has been part 
of a traveling retrospective of O'Keeffe's work organized by the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington, and has been hung with the base of the tree at 
the top left corner. The position was changed because of a 1930 photograph and 
a 1931 letter by the artist that were made available to exhibition planners by 
O'Keeffe's longtime companion and the manager of her estate. Elizabeth 
Kornhauser, the Wadsworth's curator of American painting, sculpture and 
drawing, said when O'Keeffe sold the painting to the Wadsworth, "she indicated 
to us that it could be hung in any direction." ALEENE MacMINN

SUPERVISORS OUST DEPT. HEAD AFTER 2-YEAR ABSENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A department director who has received nearly $150,000 in salary, even though 
he has not worked in nearly two years, was removed from office Tuesday by Los 
Angeles County supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The board removed George Tice, director of the Facilities Management 
Department, after quizzing Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon about 
why it took so long to determine that Tice's stress-related illnesses made him 
incapable of returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter, the supervisors also restructured county government by 
removing three county departments from Dixon's control and combining them into 
one new department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money-Saving Move 
</P>
<P>
Most supervisors said the action was not a slap at Dixon but rather a 
consolidation designed to save money and make the departments more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Even Pete Schabarum, a persistent critic of the chief administrator, said he 
saw the shift of authority as a structural change. He would not elaborate on 
statements made Monday by an aide that the supervisor believes Dixon has "gone 
beyond the scope of his authority" and infringed on the policy-making powers of 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not have asked (his aide) to make those comments," Schabarum said in a 
brief interview. Such things "are best discussed" privately between Dixon and 
himself, Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum subtly pressed Dixon, however, on why the Tice disability claim had 
not been settled more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to do a better job of not moving swiftly" on disability claims than 
others, Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
"From my discussions with other public and private employers, I don't think 
that is true," Dixon responded. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said cases like that of Tice -- who left work complaining of dizziness in 
February, 1987, and never returned -- are common. Many off-duty workers 
continue to receive full pay for months or years while their disability claims 
are being decided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said in an interview that he kept abreast of the Tice case and tried to 
move it along but was frustrated by a slow-moving state workers' compensation 
system under which a disability claim by Tice was being processed. 
</P>
<P>
By law, Dixon said, he could not recommend that Tice be fired until medical 
experts agreed that he was capable of returning to work or that he was 
incapable of reassuming his duties. 
</P>
<P>
In December, doctors finally concluded that Tice is "permanently 
incapacitated." The doctors -- a psychiatrist and an internist -- concluded 
that Tice should not return to direct facilities management "because of the 
emotionally stressful nature of that position," Dixon said in a report to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring proposal -- which merges the facilities, purchasing and data 
processing departments now run by Dixon into an independent Internal Services 
Department -- was approved unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich's motion said the change would save money, 
streamline operations "and restore proper lines of authority" in county 
government. His comment reflected a recommendation made earlier by the county 
Economy and Efficiency Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a report to supervisors that it supports the new 
structure because the chief administrative officer's role as principal adviser 
to the supervisors conflicts with the role he assumes when stepping in as an 
interim department head. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich noted that the board had given the chief administrative officer 
control of the three departments since 1987 but only as a temporary measure 
when the department chiefs left county employment. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon supported the restructuring, saying the three departments "could function 
most efficiently as a consolidated department." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said Dixon should be relieved "not to have to be the 
purchasing agent (or) the head janitor, not to have to put gas in our car, not 
all these other functions." 
</P>
<P>
"You'll thank me some day," Hahn said.

CITY TO HIRE MORE INSPECTORS FOR STORAGE TANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's lagging effort to inspect thousands of underground storage tanks -- 
many of them leaking -- got a boost Tuesday from Mayor Tom Bradley, who 
announced plans to nearly double the Fire Department's inspection staff. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious threat. There are 15,000 of these underground storage 
tanks," Bradley told a City Hall news conference. "They present a real danger 
to the community, and we are going to eliminate this danger." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he has asked the City Council for an interim appropriation of 
$440,000 to accelerate inspection and monitoring of underground tanks by 
increasing the tank-inspection staff from 13 to 25 as part of a three-year 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been responsible for inspecting and monitoring underground tanks 
since 1983, when the state Legislature required it. But, Bradley said, a 
three-year program started in the last fiscal year "fell behind" partially 
because of an "underestimation of work." 
</P>
<P>
Citing estimates based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency studies, Fire 
Chief Donald O. Manning said Tuesday that about 20% of the underground tanks in 
the city -- holding a wide range of material ranging from gasoline and paint to 
"dirty" waste products -- are leaking. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones we are concerned about are those that are leaking and no one really 
knows that," Manning said. "There are tanks out there . . . that have been put 
in illegally. One of our efforts is to discover and get those taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department started sending permit applications and tank-testing 
requirements to owners last May. And, starting July 1, inspectors began 
examining tanks and insisting on pressure tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number in Compliance 
</P>
<P>
So far, according to Assistant City Fire Chief Marshal Davis Parsons, about 
2,400 underground tanks in the city are in compliance. Parsons blamed the 
seeming tardiness in enforcing the 1983 law on the time-consuming process of 
determining the scope of the tank problem, developing technology and finally 
getting the money and staff to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
When The Times surveyed local agencies statewide last summer, only about half 
of an estimated 142,000 underground storage tanks in California had been 
tested. Water officials in Southern California expressed fears that pollution 
from leaking tanks could one day limit the region's "banking" of water in 
subterranean basins for dry years. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported then that of the 725 tanks owned by Los Angeles itself, just 
199 had been tested for leaks and 62 monitored. At the same time, Los Angeles 
County said that it oversees about 18,500 tanks in 80 cities and the 
unincorporated area and about 5,100 of that number had met its standards for 
testing and monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
Up to this point, according to Parsons, the Los Angeles Fire Department has 
dealt mostly with tank owners who are complying voluntarily. Inspections were 
"cranked up" more in December, he said, even though no violators have yet been 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector reported last March that a layer of jet fuel up to five feet thick 
had contaminated ground water beneath huge storage tanks at Los Angeles 
International Airport, and airport officials began an assessment of the 
problem. An airport spokesman Tuesday said a consultant has been retained to 
help devise a cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
In April, state officials ordered a multimillion-dollar cleanup beneath the 
Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, where studies estimated that up to 252 
million gallons of fuel had leaked into ground water.

SUPERVISORS TENTATIVELY OK LAW BANNING BIAS AGAINST AIDS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Board of Supervisors tentatively approved an ordinance Tuesday that 
would bar employers, landlords, schools and businesses in unincorporated areas 
of Los Angeles County from discriminating against AIDS victims and those 
suspected of having the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors adopted on a 3-2 vote a sweeping anti-discrimination law that 
makes it illegal to exclude from jobs and promotions AIDS victims, people with 
the AIDS virus and those an employer suspects might be infected. 
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits denial of housing or consumer services to the same people. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will be back before the board next week for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Another 3-2 Vote' 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, who in recent years has often split with conservative 
colleagues Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich on health issues, provided the 
deciding vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Another 3-2 vote," Dana aide Michael Pohndorff said, "but we got it." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich argued against the ordinance, saying it duplicates state and federal 
anti-discrimination laws and would cost thousands of dollars a year to enforce. 
He recommended that the money be spent on hospices for victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and that the county refer discrimination cases to an 
existing mediation board. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Schrader, vice chairman of the county Commission on AIDS, which 
recommended approval of the ordinance, acknowledged that existing law prohibits 
discrimination against AIDS victims. However, he said, the President's 
Commission on AIDS has concluded that existing anti-discrimination laws are 
often ineffective and slow to be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is needed to make the county's position "clear and unequivocal," 
Schrader told the board. "It creates no harm, but it does increase the clarity" 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman agreed. "It's important for this county to make a 
statement and make a statement very clearly that discrimination against people 
with AIDS . . . is not going to be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, the home of the second-largest concentration of AIDS 
victims in the country behind New York City, has trailed a number of large 
California cities and counties in adopting an anti-discrimination law, Edelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county ordinance is modeled after a city law in Los Angeles that was 
adopted in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county ordinance: 
</P>
<P>
* Employers are not allowed to reject job applicants because they have or are 
suspected of having an AIDS-related illness. Nor can they demote or fire 
workers for those reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Employment agencies are prohibited from refusing to refer such people for 
jobs. Labor unions are prohibited from excluding them from membership and 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Landlords cannot refuse housing or evict tenants because they suffer, or 
might suffer, from AIDS. Exempted from this restriction would be housing where 
an owner or lessor or any family member shares the dwelling with the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
* Businesses would not be allowed to deny "goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages and accommodations" on grounds of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
* Educational institutions could not bar admission or impose different 
conditions on students because of fear of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Damages and Costs' 
</P>
<P>
Victims of AIDS discrimination could file lawsuits or obtain injunctions. 
Courts would award "actual damages and costs" to victims who could prove their 
rights were violated, the ordinance says. The county's Dispute Resolution 
Program could also be used to settle disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance is important, Schrader said, because it provides AIDS 
victims, many of whom are "so defeated they don't have strength" to file 
lawsuits, a quick method of resolving their complaints.

CRIME IS DOWN, BUT BLOCK NOT SATISFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crime in Los Angeles County "leveled off at an unacceptable level" in 1988, Los 
Angeles Sheriff Sherman Block said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While overall major crime was down about 4% for the year in the area under the 
sheriff's jurisdiction, Block noted that aggravated assault increased 10%, auto 
theft by 11% and robbery by 7%. There was virtually no change in the number of 
murders committed in the area, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide total for 1988 was 284, compared to 286 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The big picture is that crime, particularly violent crime, has pretty much 
remained at a high level," Block said. "The community seems to have developed 
far too high a tolerance to violence. We seem to accept it as a condition of 
life in the big city or whatever."

POLICEMAN WOUNDS SUSPECTED ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills police shot and wounded a suspected robber Tuesday after he 
allegedly advanced toward a detective while wielding a knife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Quilla, 30, was in serious but stable condition at a Beverly Hills 
hospital after being shot once in the stomach, Lt. Dave Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified officer received a superficial wound when the bullet ricocheted 
from the suspect and struck the officer's leg, Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Quilla entered an elevator with a woman in an office building at 333 S. Beverly 
Drive, Griffey said. The woman later told officers that Quilla threatened her 
with a knife and attempted to rob her. She began screaming, officers said, and 
the suspect ran without taking anything when the elevator doors opened. 
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes officers later saw a man running and carrying a knife near a 
supermarket at Beverly Drive and Olympic Boulevard, police said. The officers 
ordered the man to stop, but he "started running right at our detectives with a 
knife," Griffey said. An officer who was not identified fired one shot, 
wounding Quilla, police said. He will be booked on suspicion of robbery and 
assault with a deadly weapon, Griffey said.

AIRLINES, TRAVELERS FACE FEE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will cost airlines more to fly into Long Beach Airport and travelers more to 
park their cars there under a new fee schedule approved Tuesday by the Long 
Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, which will go into effect after a second reading of the 
ordinance next week, are intended to offset operating losses of $160,000 a 
month at the municipal airport, located just north of the 405 Freeway. 
Long-term parking fees will jump from $6 to $9 a day, and landing fees for 
commercial airlines and private planes will increase, as will terminal gate 
fees.

HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER ACCUSED OF CAMPUS BOOKMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An English teacher accused of taking bets on sporting events from teachers and 
students at a Sun Valley high school has been arrested on suspicion of 
bookmaking, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Hammond, 54, of Van Nuys, was arrested Friday at John H. Francis 
Polytechnic High School, where vice officers found bookmaking records in his 
possession, Capt. Rick Dinse said. 
</P>
<P>
When police later searched Hammond's home, they found a large amount of paper 
work in which Hammond apparently recorded bets from students and teachers, 
Dinse said. Police also found cocaine paraphernalia and a small amount of 
marijuana in the home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond was released from the North Hollywood jail on $500 bail after his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Hammond has been transferred 
to a non-teaching position, but made no other comment. Hammond could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hammond apparently was running a small one-man operation that 
catered to about a dozen teachers and students and took bets of up to $20 on 
pro football games and other sports events. But an investigation is continuing 
to determine how much money Hammond took in and whether other bookmakers were 
involved, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extensive' Records 
</P>
<P>
"The records we got from him are quite extensive," Lt. Brad Merritt said. "But 
so far we have no indications there was anybody else involved." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 110 teachers and administrators and 2,400 students at 
Polytechnic High, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Merritt said the investigation began in early December, when an unidentified 
student told school police that Hammond was taking bets. School police asked 
the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Officers determined that Hammond took bets at the school during lunch breaks 
and after school, recording each transaction in a notebook, Merritt said. "He 
never did it during classes," the police official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state education code and board policies, any teacher found guilty of 
gambling either with students or on school grounds would be subject to 
discipline ranging from a letter of reprimand to dismissal, said Ada Treiger, 
an attorney for the school district.

MASKED GUNMEN BEAT, ROB WRITER-PRODUCER IN BEVERLY HILLS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four masked gunmen invaded a Beverly Hills mansion, held the butler and his 
wife captive and beat and robbed the home's owner of $500,000 in cash and 
jewelry, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Michael Alesia, 45, a television writer-producer, was treated and 
released early Tuesday morning from Beverly Hills Medical Center where it took 
37 stitches to close head wounds inflicted during the Monday night attack, 
according to Lt. Robert Curtis of the Beverly Hills Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The assault on Alesia culminated a five-hour ordeal in which his butler was 
forced at gunpoint into the producer's home in the 800 block of North Elm 
Drive. The robbers held the butler and his wife captive while waiting for 
Alesia. The police did not identify the butler or his wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Dog for Walk 
</P>
<P>
The butler had taken Alesia's dog for a walk about 6 p.m., Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he returned about 6:30 p.m.," Curtis said, "the dog started acting 
strangely and barking. 
</P>
<P>
"From a position of concealment somewhere, the suspect appeared, put a gun to 
the butler's head and forced him inside the house," Curtis said. He was not 
sure where the robber had been hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Three other gunmen, all masked, armed and wearing gloves, also entered the 
house and demanded to know where the valuables were kept. 
</P>
<P>
"When they found out the owner wasn't home . . . , they bound and gagged the 
butler and his wife and waited for the owner to get home." 
</P>
<P>
Alesia, an independent writer-producer whose television credits include 
"Laverne and Shirley" and "Captain Kangaroo," arrived home about 10 p.m., 
Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was confronted at the door by one of the masked robbers, Alesia tried 
to run away but was caught by a gunman and forced to the floor, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banged Head on Floor 
</P>
<P>
"To find out where the valuables were," Curtis said, "they apparently banged 
his head several times on (a hardwood) floor," forcing him to tell them where 
he kept his jewels and cash. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers then bound and gagged Alesia, escaping from the house with about 
$500,000 in valuables, including jewels, cash and Alesia's 1983 Toyota Tercel, 
Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police received a call on an emergency line from a woman yelling that there had 
been a robbery, Curtis said. The call came in at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, 
Curtis said, apparently because it had taken some time for the gagged and bound 
victims to free themselves. 
</P>
<P>
All was quiet Tuesday afternoon at the tree-shaded Tudor-style mansion where 
the assault and robbery occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, identifying herself only as a household employee and speaking through 
an intercom attached to a wrought-iron fence surrounding the house, said 
Alesia, his butler and their wives were in seclusion and unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Alesia's wife was out of town at the time of the assault, said Ralph Goldman, 
Alesia's business manager. She returned Tuesday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said he did not know why Alesia kept such a large amount of cash and 
jewels inside the house. The biggest loss, he added, was the jewelry.

REVENGE CITED AS MOTIVE FOR 4 HOMICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key prosecution witness testified Tuesday that he heard convicted cocaine 
trafficker Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah vow to "have the people on their knees" 
for having robbed him of $1 million in drugs, money and jewelry in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Scott Thorson, said at a Los Angeles Municipal Court preliminary 
hearing that Nash told him he sent his bodyguard, Gregory D. Diles, to a home 
in Laurel Canyon to retrieve the loot. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, two of the alleged robbers and two other people were found 
beaten to death in the home on Wonderland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, a 59-year-old one-time Hollywood nightclub owner, and Diles, 40, are 
accused of the four murders in retaliation for the robbery at Nash's Studio 
City home on July 1, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the oldest pending mass murder cases in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the late pornographic movie superstar John C. Holmes was prosecuted in 
the slayings and acquitted. Afterward, officials said they knew the identities 
of the killers but lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
But murder charges were filed against Nash and Diles in September, 1988, after 
prosecutors came up with new information, primarily from Thorson, a former 
lover of the late entertainer Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson, 31, is an inmate at Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on charges 
of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
He testified Tuesday that he met Nash in mid-1981 and began visiting his home 
frequently to buy cocaine. He said Nash was "very upset" about the robbery and 
had sent Diles out to find Holmes, whom Nash suspected of being an accomplice 
in the theft. A short time later, Thorson said, Diles returned with Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
"Diles had him by the back of the neck," the witness recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eddie Was Screaming' 
</P>
<P>
Standing outside Nash's bedroom, Thorson said, he could hear Nash threatening 
Holmes and banging him against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie was screaming at the top of his lungs," saying he would have Holmes and 
his family killed unless Holmes took Nash to those who had robbed him, Thorson 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have those people on their knees," Nash vowed, according to Thorson. 
</P>
<P>
When Nash, Diles and a disheveled Holmes emerged from the bedroom, Thorson 
said, Nash told Diles and Holmes to go retrieve the stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm through with them, they'll never steal again," Thorson quoted Nash as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
Later, apparently after the killings, Thorson said Nash expressed his regret at 
the "bloody mess." 
</P>
<P>
Thorson quoted Nash as having said that "the whole thing had gotten out of 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
According to Thorson and other witnesses, Holmes had participated in the 
planning of the robbery of Nash's home. The actor died of complications of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other robbery participants were not in the Wonderland Avenue home 
when the killings occurred and are expected to testify if Municipal Judge 
Marion L. Obera finds sufficient evidence to order a trial for Nash and Diles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survivor Recalls Little 
</P>
<P>
The homicide victims were William DeVerell, 42 and Ronald Launius, 37, both of 
whom had participated in the robbery; and Joy A. Miller, 46, and Barbara 
Richardson, 22, who were apparently visiting the Laurel Canyon home. Launius' 
wife, Susan, was seriously injured and says she remembers little of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson sued Liberace in 1982, claiming that in return for being the 
entertainer's former live-in chauffeur, travel secretary, animal trainer and 
lover, Liberace promised him $70,000 a year for life, plus up to $30,000 a year 
for pet care and use of one of his homes. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace, who died in February, 1987, of complications of AIDS, denied there 
was such an agreement. The suit was settled in 1984 out of court.

TRASH-TO-ENERGY FIRM ENLISTS PARTNER, HOPES TO REOPEN COUNTY TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The would-be developer of a trash-to-energy plant in San Marcos enlisted 
another company Tuesday, a joint venture of an Italian firm and a subsidiary of 
a Washington public utility, to operate the recycling component of the 
controversial $250-million project. 
</P>
<P>
With that development, Thermo Electron Corp. hopes in two weeks to resume 
contract negotiations with San Diego County supervisors to privately operate 
the trash-burning power plant next to the county landfill in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have balked at re-entering contract talks with Thermo Electron's 
local company, North County Resource Recovery Associates, to operate the 
recycling and trash-burning facility because it doubted that the firm had the 
financial strength and commitment to see the project through on its own. Three 
previous partners have backed out of the project over the past six years, 
frustrated in large part by the public opposition and lawsuits that have 
delayed its progress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussion Delayed 
</P>
<P>
The issue of the on-and-off contract talks was to be taken up again by 
supervisors Tuesday, but they delayed discussion for two weeks because of 
Tuesday morning's signing of a memorandum of understanding between Thermo 
Electron Energy Systems of Waltham, Mass., and American Recovery Corp. of 
Washington. Thermo Electron Energy Systems is a subsidiary of Thermo Electron 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is intended to give both the county staff and public watchdogs a 
chance to study what effect American Recovery Corp. might have on the project. 
</P>
<P>
American Recovery is a joint venture of Sorain Cecchini Recovery of Italy and 
Potomac Capital Investment, a subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power, a publicly 
held utility that serves the Washington area. Among its other investments, 
Potomac Capital is part owner of five solar energy plants in the Mojave Desert 
and is bidding on projects elsewhere to burn trash for power. 
</P>
<P>
American Recovery's role in San Marcos will be to design, construct and operate 
the recycling system that will filter out the ferrous metals, aluminum, paper, 
plastics and other recyclable materials. The remaining garbage will be burned 
in order to reduce the amount of dumped garbage and to serve as fuel for 
boilers to generate electricity for sale to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
American Recovery President William Sim said he expects 20% of the trash flow 
into the plant to be recycled, using technology developed by Sorain Cecchini, 
which for about 20 years has designed and operated similar recycling operations 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Add Credibility 
</P>
<P>
None of its hardware is now in place in the United States, but the company was 
previously selected by North County Resource Recovery Associates to provide the 
recycling machinery, said Jerry Davis, president of Thermo Electron Energy 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said American Recovery will not be a partner in the San Marcos project, 
but will add to the project's credibility because of its agreement to operate 
and guarantee the recycling operation as a vendor to Thermo Electron. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that supervisors will now agree to authorize staff 
members to meet with NCRRA to negotiate a contract that will set terms such as 
how much NCRRA will charge the county to process trash, how much the county 
will make in royalty revenue based on the sale of recyclable material and to 
what degree the county will have to share in the financial risks. 
</P>
<P>
The county and NCRRA previously had signed a contract for the operation of the 
plant, but that pact was ruled invalid by a San Diego Superior Court judge for 
a variety of reasons, in part unresolved environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The project also is targeted by more than a dozen lawsuits filed by the cities 
of Escondido, Encinitas and Carlsbad, as well as neighboring landowners.

MOTHER, BABY REPORTED RECOVERING

A woman who was struck by a hit-and-run driver while crossing Interstate 5 near 
the Mexican border was in fair condition Tuesday at Scripps Memorial Hospital 
in Chula Vista, and her 10-month-old daughter, abandoned near the border, was 
picked up by her father, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Onecima Lopez, 30, was alert after having her left thigh bone, lower right leg 
and right ankle repaired in surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said. Lopez is in 
traction and may need further surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Her baby, hospitalized after spending two nights in a sewer pipe near the 
border, was picked up Tuesday afternoon by Theodore Lopez, a Los Angeles 
resident who had never seen his daughter before, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Lopez, sporting freshly combed hair and a new pink dress, was holding a 
white, stuffed panda about the same size as she when her father came to pick 
her up, said Mark Morelli, spokesman for Children's Hospital, where Sandra was 
later transferred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Looked Like a Doll' 
</P>
<P>
"She looked like a doll, she really did," Morelli said, "Her dad, he was all 
smiles. He hugged her and kissed her." The two are believed to be in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said there 
was a "good chance" that mother and daughter would not be deported.

3 GENERATIONS OF TUNA FISHERMEN SAW IT ALL CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1900s, Julius Zolezzi and his wife, Victoria, moved to San Diego 
from San Francisco, bought the Pacaritto and began fishing for halibut and rock 
cod with his son, John. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1932, when Zolezzi saw that more money was to be made in the tuna 
industry, he bought the Balboa, a seiner. The Point Loma family has been 
fishing for tuna ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Three generations and eight boats later, Zolezzi's great-grandson, John Zolezzi 
III, is carrying on the tradition. The 33-year-old skipper and his crew are 
scheduled to leave today aboard the Mary Antoinette on an expedition that will 
last anywhere from five weeks to three months in international waters off 
Mexico. Then he'll be back with his family for two or three weeks before 
returning to sea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Like It Used to Be' 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed since his father, John Zolezzi Jr., 56, retired in 1974 and 
turned the seiner over to his son. 
</P>
<P>
Tuna fishing "is not a family operation like it used to be," said John Jr. "We 
are one of the few family-operated and -owned tuna boats." 
</P>
<P>
John Sr., 79, agreed. Families "are selling out to big corporations and foreign 
companies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people in the business that don't know anything about the business," 
complained John Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is the corporate-run fishing boats whose captains take shortcuts and 
make trouble for other fishermen. He cited incidents in which porpoises, which 
are often found near tuna, were killed after becoming tangled in the nets. The 
seiners are now required to have an observer from the National Marine Fisheries 
Service aboard while fishing, in order to protect the mammals, but even before 
that rule, "we tried saving the porpoises all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the porpoise, you can't find the fish. If you do this long-term, you 
do what's proper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$340 to $1,000 a Ton 
</P>
<P>
The changing industry has also changed the face of San Diego. Only a few years 
ago, the city's harbor bustled with tuna seiners that came to unload their 
gorged bellies at half a dozen canneries. Since the last cannery closed in 
1984, the Zolezzi family has gone to the only remaining one nearby, the Pan 
Pacific Cannery at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. There, depending on the 
size of the tuna, the Zolezzis are paid anywhere from $340 to $1,000 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the family has made a determined effort to avoid the shores of 
other countries. In 1979, John Jr.'s brother, Julius, owned one of the eight 
seiners that was seized near the Peruvian border because it was fishing too 
close to the coast. The family now stays 12 to 20 miles offshore. (Julius now 
operates three seiners in the East Pacific, and is director of the American 
Tuna Boat Assn.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite these changes, the big advantage of being a family-run business has 
remained: The Zolezzis are able to set their own schedules. As much as they 
can, they try to stay home for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"A corporation will send you out, Christmas or no Christmas. That's the 
difference between being a corporation and a family," John Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he acknowledges that he is happier now that his son has taken over and 
is thankful for the time he can spend with his grandchildren. "My kids grew up 
and I didn't even know it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John III agreed that being separated from wife, Machelle, daughter, Chalise, 
and son, John IV, isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first week, you don't even think that you're on the boat. Then you 
realize that it's your business; it's your life. You accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Will 7-year-old John IV be the next Zolezzi to fill the shoes of the fisherman? 
His father doubts it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure he'll go to college," John III said. "He loves the boat and 
loves to fish, but I hope he does whatever makes him happy."

REPORT CALLS FAIRGROUNDS AN ECONOMIC BOON TO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to increase their stock as good neighbors, officials at the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds released a report Tuesday indicating that the facility pumped more 
than $74.5 million into the regional economy during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted for the fair board by Economics Research Associates, also 
suggests that visitors to the fairground spent $12 million in the neighboring 
city of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach also benefited from economic activity generated by the 
fairgrounds, the report contends, reaping an estimated $4.6 million during the 
year. All the estimates were based on exit interviews with visitors to horse 
racing and other activities at the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although fair board officials said the report demonstrates the positive impact 
of the fairgrounds, at least one Del Mar official expressed a cautionary note. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame any organization for wanting good PR, but I want to look at the 
figures," said Del Mar Councilwoman Brooke Eisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials, however, gushed about the the report, which detailed money 
spent in the region and neighboring cities by visitors drawn to the 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these figures show the positive impact and good the fair does do for 
the community," said Robert Spanjian, fair board president. "I think it will 
help improve our image in the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quarreled With Leaders 
</P>
<P>
In years past, the fair board has quarreled with leaders of neighboring 
communities over traffic, noise, pollution and other factors. Most recently, 
the board tussled with city officials in Del Mar and Solana Beach over 
automobile racing that was held in 1987 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from benefiting the private sector in the local communities, the 
fairgrounds helped the municipal governments, pumping more than $1.3 million in 
tax revenues into Del Mar coffers and $425,000 to Solana Beach, the report 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that the fairground also created the equivalent of 1,674 
full-time jobs, making it one of the largest employers in the region. The 
equivalent of 220 full-time jobs were held by Del Mar residents, while people 
from Solana Beach held down the equivalent of 88 full-time positions, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the $16,000 study are the feature item in a new fair board 
newsletter that was unveiled at the Tuesday press conference. Officials said 
the four-page, quarterly newsletter will be mailed to 9,000 Del Mar and Solana 
Beach residents at an annual cost of $25,000.

<P>
Instructor Vance Breise, 51, underwent surgery for abdominal injuries and was 
in serious condition Tuesday night in the intensive care unit at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHO PENASQUITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rancho Penasquitos woman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that she tried 
to stab her 11-year-old son to death. 
</P>
<P>
Keon Lee, 37, who had the arraignment proceedings interpreted into Korean for 
her, was ordered held on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is charged with attempted murder, child endangerment, inflicting corporal 
punishment on a child and assault with a deadly weapon. She appeared before San 
Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz in chains and jail clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz unsuccessfully argued that bail should be set at 
$1 million. Katz declined to say how many stab wounds the boy suffered and did 
not divulge the child's name to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go into details of the case. The police are still 
investigating. . . . She's had mental problems in the past," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor did say that Lee tried to buy a gun last month, but did not want 
to wait for the 15-day waiting period that is required for such purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The boy remains hospitalized with wounds suffered in the attack Saturday at the 
family home. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and her husband also have a 13-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Domnitz set a March 3 preliminary hearing.

An Oceanside man pleaded guilty Tuesday to first-degree murder in the slaying 
of a Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Allan Silva, 33, could receive a life sentence for shooting Cpl. Robert 
Winters, 23, in the back on Aug. 31 on the base.

<P>
Silva is also wanted in New Bedford, Mass., in the killing of a woman there in

<P>
Silva's attorney, Charles Adair, said Silva had been seeing Winters' wife, and 
the motive for the shooting was a love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam set sentencing for April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Adair said Silva may plead guilty to second-degree murder once he is extradited 
to Massachusetts in the other case.

CS LONG BEACH DOWNS UTAH STATE, 74-69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's too soon to tell whether this season's Cal State Long Beach team will 
develop into one as good as last season's, but the 49ers accomplished something 
Tuesday night that they were unable to do last year: They beat Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the only team to beat us in our gym last year, that was enough 
(motivation) for me," center John Hatten said after scoring 12 of his team-high 
16 points in the second half of the 49ers' 74-69 victory before 1,088 in the 
university gym. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third straight for the 49ers (6-7 overall, 3-1 in the Big 
West Conference) and their fourth in the last 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Aggies swept 2 games from the 49ers, who had their best season 
(17-12) this decade. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case most of this season, there were many contributors for Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Eastin had 14 points, including 4 straight free throws down the stretch; 
Tyrone Mitchell had 13 points; Darrell Faulkner had 13 points and 5 steals; 
Rolf Jacobs had 7 rebounds and 5 assists, and reserves Rudy Harvey and Marco 
Fleming combined for 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
The game was close throughout. Baskets by Eastin and Harvey at the end of the 
first half gave the 49ers a 41-37 lead, despite 60% shooting by the Aggies in 
the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State's only second-half lead was 45-43, which the 49ers quickly erased by 
scoring 8 straight points, a run Hatten started with 2 inside shots. 
</P>
<P>
But led by veterans Reid Newey and Dan Conway, Utah State (4-9, 2-2) would not 
let the 49ers put the game away. Trailing, 60-59, the Aggies had a chance to 
take the lead, but Faulkner stole the ball from Newey and hit Mitchell for a 
fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
With 43 seconds left, Newey, who led the Aggies with 19 points, hit one of his 
4 3-pointers to cut the lead to 68-67 and force the 49ers to win the game with 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistent in recent games at the foul line, the 49ers were on target this 
time. After Eastin made both ends of a 1-and-1, Faulkner made 2 with 16 seconds 
left after rebounding a 3-point attempt by Nathan Grant. Eastin then added 2 
more.

SANTA BARBARA REMAINS UNBEATEN 
</P>

UC Santa Barbara, still waiting to shake the distinction of being the nation's 
only undefeated but unranked team, pulled away from Cal State Fullerton in the 
second half for a 69-59 Big West Conference victory Tuesday night before a 
sellout crowd of 6,000 in the Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos fell behind by as many as 6 points in the first half, and held only 
a 32-29 halftime lead, but they put the Titans away behind Eric McArthur's 15 
second-half points. McArthur, a 6-foot 6-inch forward, finished with a 
career-high 25 points, and had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Santa Barbara's 11th without a loss this season, setting a 
school record for consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-0 mark is easily Santa Barbara's best start, surpassing last season's 
7-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara is one of 4 undefeated Division I teams in the country. The 
others are No. 1 Duke, No. 2 Illinois and No. 20 Providence. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had its sixth straight loss, falling to 5-7, 0-3 in the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 22-16 lead in the first half, using an aggressive match-up 
zone defense that helped cause several Santa Barbara turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Barbara took over the lead on a 3-point shot by Carrick DeHart (21 
points) that put the Gauchos ahead, 23-22, with about 7 minutes left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton retied the score and then went ahead by 3 again. But a 7-1 run by the 
Gauchos gave them the 3-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton went cold at the start of the second half. Cedric Ceballos, who had 
dispelled talk of a slump by scoring 14 points in the first half without 
missing a shot, missed a layup at the outset. Ceballos finished with 18 points, 
and for the Titans, it only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans didn't score in the second half until more than 4 minutes had 
passed, finally making a basket after Santa Barbara had scored the first 8 
points. Fullerton fell behind by as many as 14 but cut the lead to 6 with 2:47 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans never got any closer as Santa Barbara made 5 of 6 free throws 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of our guys," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "I think they 
probably played about as well as anyone has played Santa Barbara the first 20 
minutes. I thought for 30 minutes we played pretty good basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Titans) haven't surrendered by any means. They're still playing every 
night even though we've lost this many games early. I'm proud of that."

JEFFERIES EMERGES FROM GAF TRIAL WITH HARSHER IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even after pleading guilty to a pair of felonies nearly two years ago, Boyd L. 
Jefferies enjoyed a cleaner reputation than others caught in the securities 
industry corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The word from his lawyers, colleagues and Jefferies himself was that his crimes 
were minor violations of arcane laws, an innocent reflection of the master 
trader's zeal to accommodate clients. 
</P>
<P>
"These were extremely technical, really closer to civil violations," Jefferies, 
the founder of Jefferies &amp; Co., said in an interview a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
But now a harsher image is emerging of how Jefferies turned the Los Angeles 
company into perhaps the most aggressive and innovative stock trading firm off 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
And once again the source is Boyd L. Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
The new tale is being told in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where the 
former executive is the prosecution's star witness in the criminal trial of 
chemical company GAF Corp. and its vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the judge declared a mistrial in the case, ruling that the 
government's failure to disclose possible tampering with a key piece of 
evidence hurt the defendants unfairly. The judge said the second trial would 
begin Thursday, which will put the spotlight back on Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
In his debut on the witness stand last week, Jefferies, 58, described how he 
inflated the price of Union Carbide stock so his client, GAF, could sell 10 
million shares at a higher price. He also acknowledged participating in illegal 
schemes with at least four other customers but did not provide details. 
</P>
<P>
He said he destroyed business documents routinely, even as he was negotiating 
his agreement to cooperate with the government. And he admitted funneling 
thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to politicians through 
company employees. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies is not the only witness expected to provide a glimpse behind the 
scenes at the firm. Another witness on the government list is the firm's 
director of trading, James Melton, who was described by a prosecutor as having 
"joined the (GAF) conspiracy and carried out the illegal arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its plea bargain with Jefferies, however, the government agreed not 
to prosecute other employees and not to revoke the brokerage license of 
Jefferies &amp; Co. for his acts. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Klowden, a lawyer with the firm's outside counsel, Morgan, Lewis 
&amp; Bockius, and a director of the brokerage's parent, Jefferies Group, said 
a company inquiry found that employees involved in violations were following 
orders from Jefferies and did not act independently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Successful Trader 
</P>
<P>
As a result, no one has been fired for participating in any of the schemes. But 
the brokerage firm has instituted new internal controls and hired Paul Bodor, a 
former official with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to monitor 
compliance with U.S. securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Before pleading guilty in April, 1987, and resigning from the firm, Jefferies 
was one of the most successful traders in the country. His tenacity and 
creativity in executing huge trades for large institutional clients and 
takeover specialists had turned his 25-year-old firm into a force in the merger 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the former cattle ranch laborer had become wealthy. His salary 
and bonus in 1986 totaled $1.8 million and he owned 13% of the company. He sold 
a home in Laguna Beach for $8.3 million in 1986 and bought a house in posh 
Indian Wells, near Palm Springs, to go with his ski home in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
When his involvement in the Wall Street scandal surfaced, associates blamed his 
passion for trading and accommodating customers. The charges to which he 
pleaded guilty did not have the odor of self-enrichment that marked the pleas 
of earlier defendants, such as investment banker Dennis B. Levine and stock 
speculator Ivan F. Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
One count involved hiding stock owned by Boesky on the books of Jefferies &amp; 
Co., a practice known as "parking." The other covered permitting an undisclosed 
investor to buy stock without putting up at least the 50% cash required by law, 
a "margin" violation. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the press reported that the margin violation involved the stock of 
Fireman's Fund and other details of Jefferies' activities began to leak out, 
the extent of his stock manipulation remained masked. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, a clearer picture of what Jefferies did began to 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 3, stock speculator Salim B. Lewis was indicted on conspiracy and stock 
manipulation charges in connection with alleged efforts to inflate the price of 
Fireman's Fund stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linked to Bilzerian 
</P>
<P>
According to the charges, Lewis arranged with Jefferies to buy 410,000 shares 
of Fireman's Fund to boost the price the day before American Express sold stock 
and warrants in the company to the public. Lewis has a long connection with 
American Express, but no one at the financial giant has been accused of 
wrongdoing or involvement. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 21, corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian was indicted on 12 counts of 
securities and tax fraud connected with four takeover attempts in 1985 and 
1986. Again, Jefferies was at the center of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme hinged on secret deals between Bilzerian and Jefferies to conceal 
the raider's ownership of stock in four companies, according to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Another alleged secret deal by Jefferies forms the basis of the charges against 
GAF, also a big client of Jefferies &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
This time, prosecutors charge, Jefferies agreed to buy blocks of Union Carbide 
stock to push up its price so GAF could unload 10 million shares at a higher 
price. GAF had acquired the shares in an aborted attempt to take over Union 
Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies testified that he struck the deal with James T. Sherwin, the GAF vice 
chairman indicted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sherwin called me and asked me in summary and in substance if they wanted 
to have Union Carbide close at a specific price for several days in a row, 
would I be willing to do that, and I said yes," said Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sherwin promised to make up any money Jefferies lost in the trades. 
Jefferies said he later sent GAF a fraudulent invoice for $40,000 in phantom 
investment banking services to cover his losses. The government claims 
fraudulent invoices were also used in Jefferies' dealings with Boesky and 
Bilzerian. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by a GAF defense attorney, Jefferies also admitted using 
company employees to conceal illegal campaign contributions to politicians. The 
political twist surprised the top brass at Jefferies &amp; Co., according to 
Frank Baxter, the longtime associate who became chief executive when Jefferies 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said he reimbursed employees for contributions made to unnamed 
politicians, a violation of federal election law. One politician received about 
$17,000 in the scheme, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Girl Scout Cookies 
</P>
<P>
A person familiar with the arrangements said Jefferies had been asked by 
clients to help raise money for politicians but that he was unsuccessful. So 
Jefferies told employees to make the contributions and he reimbursed them with 
his money. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of like when my daughter can't sell enough Girl Scout cookies and 
I buy them from her," said one of the employees involved. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by a defense attorney, Jefferies said his picture still hangs 
in the entry of the firm's headquarters in downtown Los Angeles and that he 
would like to return once his five-year suspension from the securities business 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter refused to discuss the prospects for Jefferies' return, but another 
official close to the firm said: "It's wishful thinking that he'll ever be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
His sentencing has been postponed until Jefferies finishes testifying for the 
government. The maximum sentence is 10 years, but Jefferies said in court that 
he hopes to avoid prison. 
</P>
<P>
"He still views himself as a guy who got caught going through a red light, 
compared to people who were seriously and consciously violating the law for 
personal gain," said a friend.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani began his five-year term denying accusations 
that he was neglecting white-collar crime. He ended it as the nation's most 
celebrated crusader against illegal insider trading and other forms of Wall 
Street corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In his battle against Wall Street lawbreaking, as in his other battles, he was 
simultaneously praised for his effectiveness and damned as a zealot who 
trampled the rights of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as he announced his departure from his powerful post as federal prosecutor 
for Manhattan on Tuesday, allies and adversaries agreed that his departure 
wouldn't -- for a while, at least -- slow the momentum of the 2 1/2-year-old 
Wall Street probes. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations that have brought guilty pleas from Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis 
B. Levine and the Drexel Burnham Lambert securities firm "have just opened a 
spigot," said Peter Romatowksi, a Washington defense attorney and former 
prosecutor in Giuliani's office. "With Giuliani or without him, the water's 
going to keep gushing for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Giuliani agreed, saying he expected the Wall Street 
investigations will succeed at least as well without him as it did with him. 
But he took credit for what he said is a different atmosphere in the securities 
world toward lawbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the atmosphere in the business community has been changed by all these 
cases," he said, citing the securities fraud cases against Boesky and Levine, 
the tax fraud case against financier Marc Rich and other tax fraud cases. "I 
would not have anticipated what we were able to accomplish. I can leave feeling 
that we did a lot more than we thought we would." 
</P>
<P>
Several observers concurred, saying the investigations have created what one 
called a "post-Boesky morality" in the securities industry. And part of that, 
they said, stemmed from Giuliani's eagerness to seek publicity for his team's 
prosecutorial exploits. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of these cases would probably have been just about the same under 
lots of different prosecutors," said Ira Sorkin, a defense lawyer and former 
Securities and Exchange Commission official. "But Giuliani knew how to bring it 
all out for maximum public attention, and that's good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani also appeared to come close to acknowledging that he made an error in 
a case for which he has been roundly criticized, the prosecution of Goldman, 
Sachs &amp; Co. executive Robert Freeman and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
executives Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor. 
</P>
<P>
The three were indicted, arrested and led away in handcuffs in February, 1987. 
But within months, prosecutors had withdrawn the indictments, saying they were 
not prepared to go to trial against the three but promising new indictments 
would follow. They never did, and the three men have reportedly suffered 
greatly while waiting for the prosecutors' next move. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani said he might have handled the case differently "if we had known all 
the things that we have subsequently learned." He declined to discuss the case 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has also been criticized for using the federal anti-racketeering 
statute -- the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as 
RICO -- against securities firms. The statute, which carries heavy prison 
sentences and enormous financial penalties, was used by Giuliani for the first 
time against securities executives last summer with the indictments of five 
executives of Princeton/Newport Partners; Giuliani's men had threatened to use 
it against Drexel Burnham Lambert as well. 
</P>
<P>
The moves drew protests from defense lawyers who had already been complaining 
that Giuliani had been "criminalizing" securities violations by prosecuting 
cases that formerly would have been handled in civil cases by the SEC. They 
asserted that Giuliani was using the RICO weapon to force cooperation from 
unwilling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he overused the criminal law," said Stanley Arkin, a defense lawyer 
who represents Wigton and Salim B. Lewis, another executive who has been 
indicted on stock manipulation and other charges. "There have been a number of 
indictments that would not have been brought." 
</P>
<P>
But others disagreed. "Other prosecutors would have done just what he did," 
said Charles Carberry, who ran Giuliani's securities fraud unit until going 
into private practice last year. He noted that, despite the outcry over the use 
of RICO, it was the U.S. attorney in Chicago, not Giuliani, who last summer 
became the first to bring RICO charges against an individual charged with 
securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
Carberry also said it was "truly ironic" that Giuliani would be accused of 
excesses in such cases, since at the beginning of his term he was faulted for 
allegedly chasing street criminals and ignoring crimes in the corporate suites. 
</P>
<P>
While Giuliani insisted that the Wall Street prosecutions will continue no 
matter who succeeds him, in the past he has seemed to betray doubts. Last year, 
he declined to accept urgings that he run for the U.S. Senate seat held by 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), fearing that some candidates under 
consideration to succeed him might not be as eager as he was to prosecute 
insider trading cases. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one candidate under consideration then -- defense attorney Otto 
Obermaier -- is among the leading candidates for the job now, according to 
sources. Obermaier has represented several defendants charged with securities 
violations, including Robert Chestman of Gruntal &amp; Co. He also represented 
John Mulheren, who was accused of threatening the life of Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier was quoted in the National Law Journal in April, 1987, expressing 
concern that securities law violations were too often handled by prosecutors 
rather than simply by the SEC. "Criminal enforcement has superseded civil 
enforcement, and with that there has been some distortion of the position that 
Congress envisioned," he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
One of the prosecutor's principal adversaries in the Drexel case is a member of 
the committee that has been convened to suggest possible successors to 
Giuliani. The committee member is Michael Armstrong, who represents Drexel 
official Lowell Milken in the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
With Giuliani's departure, the securities prosecutions will be left in the 
hands of Benito Romano, the interim U.S. attorney, and Bruce Baird, who is 
already head of the securities and commodities fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
Romano, 39, was in Giuliani's office between 1980 and 1987 and was the 
third-ranking official when he left. He has since served as staff director of 
the New York State Commission on Government Integrity and, most recently, as a 
lawyer in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, 40, who will carry the most responsibility for the investigations and 
has been in the U.S. attorney's office since 1980, has headed the fraud unit 
since September, 1987. He also worked in the office's organized crime unit 
before becoming one of two deputy chiefs of the office's criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STILL TO COME IN THE WALL STREET CORRUPTION SCANDAL 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The investment firm has reached a tentative 
agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office to plead guilty to six 
criminal charges of mail, wire and securities fraud. Negotiations are 
continuing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle the agency's 
civil suit against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert employees. Indictments or settlements of securities 
violation charges are soon expected from Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and 
several others. 
</P>
<P>
GAF Corp. A mistrial was declared Tuesday in the stock manipulation case 
against the New Jersey chemical and building materials firm and its vice 
chairman, James T. Sherwin. Selection of a new jury is due to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul A. Bilzerian. The Florida corporate raider is due to go to trial May 1 on 
charges that he committed 12 felonies during four abortive takeover attempts in 
1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Freeman, Richard B. Wigton, Timothy L. Tabor. Federal prosecutors have 
said they intend to file new charges against the three securities executives, 
who were indicted for mail, wire and securities fraud nearly two years ago. The 
original indictments were withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton/Newport Partners. Five senior officials of the investment firm have 
been indicted on federal racketeering charges and are awaiting trial. The firm 
is being liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
Fred C. Lee. The SEC has brought charges of securities law violations against 
the Taiwanese businessman, accusing him of trading on inside information 
supplied by Stephen Wang Jr., a former junior stock analyst for Morgan Stanley 
&amp; Co. Wang pleaded guilty last October to charges stemming from his role in 
the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Mulheren. Prosecutors have repeatedly deferred bringing charges against 
the former high-flying stock speculator, who was accused of threatening the 
life of former speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Prosecutors have said they will file 
charges by Feb. 3 or drop the case. Mulheren was understood also to have been 
under investigation for securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
Salim B. Lewis. The securities trader and deal maker was indicted last November 
on 22 counts of stock manipulation, conspiracy and related offenses. His trial 
has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chestman. The former senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co. is 
scheduled to go to trial later this month on charges that he used inside 
information related to the 1986 takeover of Waldbaum's by the Great Atlantic 
&amp; Pacific Tea Co. The SEC has also filed civil charges again Chestman. 
</P>
<P>
Business Week. The investigation into stock trading that relied on advance 
information from the business magazine has already brought guilty pleas from 
two individuals, and others may be ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Haas Securities. A new federal investigation of stock manipulation came to 
light last week with the guilty plea of Stanley Aslanian Jr., former president 
of Haas, a now-defunct "penny stock" securities firm in New York. The 
investigation is said to be continuing.

JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN GAF CASE BUT ORDERS NEW TRIAL FOR THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge declared a mistrial Tuesday in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation 
case because a prosecutor had delayed turning over to defense lawyers a report 
showing that a crucial piece of evidence had been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers Stephen E. Kaufman and Arthur L. Liman immediately said they 
would ask the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to permanently dismiss the 
case. They claimed that a retrial would subject their clients to "double 
jeopardy," which is banned by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, who granted the defense request for 
a mistrial, ordered the lawyers to begin picking a new jury no later than 
Thursday. The judge said the appeal was likely to fail because there wasn't any 
evidence that the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H. Loewenson Jr., had 
intentionally delayed turning over to the defense the report by a documents 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closely Observed Trial 
</P>
<P>
The trial had been under way since Dec. 12. It ended after a week of testimony 
by Boyd L. Jefferies, the government's main witness, who had stated in court 
that he had made an illegal agreement with GAF Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin 
to bid up the price of Union Carbide stock in 1986, when GAF was preparing to 
sell a very large block of Carbide shares. Both GAF Corp. and Sherwin are 
defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been closely followed by the press and by defense attorneys in 
other securities fraud cases, in part because it is the first of the many cases 
set off by the investigation of former Wall Street stock speculator Ivan F. 
Boesky to come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin seemed elated by the judge's decision. He smiled broadly and hugged two 
of his daughters, who had been present throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But Liman, who represents GAF, said: "Nobody is happy to have a mistrial." He 
said a mistrial was necessary because the prosecutor's mistake prejudiced the 
jury's view of the case. "But we (the defense lawyers) agreed that the trial 
was progressing very well for us," Liman said, adding that "we're tired." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on behalf of GAF and Sherwin, a spokesman said: "We are 
disappointed, with the case going so well for the defense, that the 
government's conduct necessitated a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Little Chance 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the defendants would pursue an appeal to get the case 
dismissed permanently on the grounds of the "double jeopardy" provision in the 
Constitution. That protects individuals in some circumstances from being tried 
twice for the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard Uviller, a professor of criminal law at Columbia University, 
said in an interview that he thought GAF's lawyers had little chance of 
persuading the appeals court to throw out the case. 
</P>
<P>
The issue for which the mistrial was granted centered on what Loewenson had 
described as the most crucial piece of evidence in the case. It was an invoice 
from the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Jefferies &amp; Co. for $40,000 for 
"investment banking" services. Boyd Jefferies testified that the invoice was 
fraudulent, drawn up as cover for a $40,000 payment that Jefferies &amp; Co. 
expected from GAF to cover its losses in the illicit Union Carbide trading. 
</P>
<P>
When the government submitted into evidence a copy of the invoice found in 
GAF's files, Liman at the same time introduced a slightly different copy found 
in Jefferies' files. Liman then suggested in court that Jefferies might have 
altered the one in his own files to back up his story. But the report by 
Pennsylvania documents expert Gus R. Lesnivich refuted Liman's theory. 
Lesnivich's report stated that the invoice in Jefferies' files hadn't been 
altered, but that the one taken from GAF's files may have been, with 
"white-out" fluid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prejudice to Defendants 
</P>
<P>
In conferences in the judge's robing room late last week and on Monday, Liman 
argued that he would never have raised questions about the document in 
Jefferies' files if he had known about the report, which was turned over to him 
after he had made his statements in court. 
</P>
<P>
Federal rules of procedure in criminal trials require prosecutors to turn over 
to defense lawyers a broad range of material that might be deemed useful to the 
defense. Kaufman and Liman argued that the new facts brought out in the report 
would irrevocably prejudice the jury against the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In her ruling Tuesday, the judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I find that the failure to produce the expert's report resulted in 
incurable prejudice to the defendants, I grant the defendant's motion for a 
mistrial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Lowe, however, said she believed Loewenson's assertions that the delay in 
turning over the report had been an "oversight" and that he hadn't expected 
Liman to raise the issue that invoices might have been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explaining Terms 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who announced his long-expected 
resignation Tuesday during a press conference, defended Loewenson's actions. 
"The judge made it very clear that he had done nothing wrong," Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the trial had been taken up by Jefferies and other Wall Street experts 
attempting to explain the complex world of securities trading on a level that 
the jury, made up mainly of blue-collar and clerical workers, could understand. 
</P>
<P>
After the judge apologized to the jurors for the mistrial and allowed them to 
leave, one juror, William Patten, said in an interview that the jurors hadn't 
discussed the case among themselves. He said he hadn't yet developed an opinion 
of whether the defendants were guilty or innocent. Patten said he and other the 
jurors were able to follow most of the Wall Street terminology but that at 
times some of the testimony "was pretty hard to understand."

JAMES FLANIGAN: IF THINGS ARE SO GOOD, WHY IS FED SCARED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosperity is everywhere, but appearances may be deceiving. The Tokyo stock 
market is hitting new highs. New York is no slouch either, trading these days 
at its highest levels since the October, 1987, crash. And European stock 
markets are rising strongly for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the world's economies are going great guns. The U.S. economy grew 
last year at a rapid 4%, and unemployment is low. Japanese government officials 
look forward to 4% economic growth in the new fiscal year; and growth in Europe 
is picking up as Common Market nations prepare for economic unity in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence is high. The dollar is strong as world investors want to put money 
in U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think there would be happiness all around. Yet on both Monday and 
Tuesday, the Federal Reserve and other central banks sold dollars in 
international markets in an attempt to keep the currency's value down. 
</P>
<P>
And central banks everywhere are trying to raise interest rates to slow 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
That's no distant thunder. It could mean prohibitive mortgage rates for you 
within the next six months. If you have a variable-rate mortgage, your payments 
could go up; if you plan to buy or sell a house, it could be more difficult to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Negative Side 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? Transition in a world economy in which a growing number of 
newly industrialized countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, Thailand and 
India, are producing more goods than they can consume and sending them to the 
developed countries -- the United States, Canada, Japan and in Europe -- that 
are consuming more than they could possibly produce. That situation has its 
advantages. American consumers and businesses get a lot of goods, from Hyundai 
cars to Radio Shack electronic products, at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
But international monetary authorities see a negative side to the equation. The 
developed economies are growing faster than their capacity to produce for 
themselves, and that can lead to inflation, explains economist Jonathan Francis 
of Roh Management, a New York-based international investment firm. U.S. 
inflation is currently running at 4.75% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, central banks worry because global money flows are accelerating 
beyond their control. When the International Monetary Fund compiled records for 
1988, it discovered more money sloshing around in developed-nation economies 
than it had thought. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the bustling South Koreas and Taiwans, which logically 
should present ideal investment opportunities, are unwilling or unable to 
accept investment from outside, explains economist Albert M. Wojnilower, of 
First Boston. "So the retirement savings of the advanced countries search for 
outlets at home." That has resulted in abnormally high stock prices in Japan, 
and leveraged buyouts and other oddities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Soon Change 
</P>
<P>
Why haven't retirement savings resulted in more productive investment? Because 
many businesses, facing a need to expand capacity in a high-cost country like 
the United States, look over their shoulder at the low labor rates and 
operating costs of a newly industrialized country such as South Korea, and get 
nervous. So spare cash is often invested in money markets, which turn it over 
in financial transactions and give us the paradox of U.S. industry lagging in 
capacity and productivity, while billions churn senselessly in massive buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
That may be about to change, says investment strategist Charles Clough of 
Merrill Lynch. The Federal Reserve is sharply restricting money supplies in the 
U.S. economy, pushing up interest rates. So far the Fed has hit short-term 
rates -- which increases the cost of financing inventories and affects retail 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But to really slow the economy, the Fed must hike long-term interest rates for 
business loans and mortgages. How does it do that? It pushes up short-term 
rates until long-term markets have to offer higher interest to attract 
investors. That is, long-term government bonds will have to go to 10% to 11%, 
which means 12% to 13% mortgages. 
</P>

The prospect is of recession in six months' time, unless the Fed sees business 
activity slowing before then and eases up, explains Robert D. Laurent, an 
economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
And if recession comes? It would signal an initial failure of the world 
economic system to cope with prosperity. The overriding point of the changing 
world economy, after all, is rising living standards. But happily, say economic 
experts, any recession at this time will be short and much less severe than the 
1981-82 downturn -- and the world system will get a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Bull Market 
</P>
<P>
Even pessimists about the current economy forecast the 1990s as a golden 
decade, when more nations join the industrial world, and developed nations 
better coordinate their economies. "It's spread the wealth," says veteran 
investor John Templeton, of Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger, a mutual 
fund company based in London and the Bahamas. "It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Templeton, 76, who made his mark years ago with international 
investing, looks past this year to a "new bull market." He predicts the Dow 
Jones index hitting 4,000 a few years from now (from 2,193.21 on Tuesday), 
while Japan's market stalls and marks time but doesn't crash. 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds like a world in better balance, where the appearance of widespread 
prosperity will also be the reality. For now, however, the Fed and other 
central banks are making ominous moves on interest rates.

Caesars World Inc. announced a shareholder rights plan, which it said is 
designed to deter "coercive or unfair" takeover tactics against the Los 
Angeles-based casino operator. Last month, New York financier Donald J. Trump 
asked federal regulators for clearance to buy 15% or more of Caesars' stock. 
Under the plan adopted by the company's directors, preferred stock purchase 
rights will be distributed as a dividend as of Jan. 23. They will entitle 
shareholders to buy the new preferred, to be exercisable under certain 
conditions.

Shamrock Holdings said the Delaware Supreme Court granted the Burbank firm a 
quick appeal of a Chancery Court judge's ruling last week upholding the 
validity of a Polaroid Corp. employee stock plan. Shamrock, owned by the family 
of Roy E. Disney, has launched a hostile $2.4-billion bid to buy the shares in 
the Cambridge, Mass., instant photography company that it doesn't already own. 
Shamrock wants to overturn the stock plan because it puts 14% of Polaroid's 
stock into the hands of employees, which makes it difficult for Shamrock to 
acquire enough Polaroid stock to complete a merger under Delaware law.

The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Assn. said it estimated that the industry's 
book-to-bill ratio fell to 0.93 in December, down from 0.95 in November, 
reflecting an increase in semiconductor sales for the month but a decrease in 
orders. A book-to-bill ratio of 0.93 means that for every $100 worth of 
computer chips shipped, manufacturers received new orders worth $93. The 
association said an increase in semiconductor sales and a decrease in orders 
led to the decline in the ratio for December, which was a five-week reporting 
month, as opposed to November, a four-week month.

AN ABOUT-FACE INTO FAST-GROWING FIELD;

DIGITAL EQUIPMENT UNVEILS DESKTOP COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of largely ignoring the personal computer market, Digital Equipment 
Corp. on Tuesday announced a broad lineup of desktop machines designed to give 
the nation's No. 3 computer maker a share of the industry's fastest-growing 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
The three new lines unveiled in Boston represent a significant about-face for 
Digital, whose chairman and founder, Kenneth Olsen, just six months ago 
reportedly dismissed the powerful desktop workstation as "a tiny little machine 
on a desk." 
</P>
<P>
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., has been best known for its powerful 
minicomputers that can serve many users at once. With its new offerings, 
however, the company is entering the single-user desktop markets that generated 
more than $50 billion in worldwide sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Desktop computers typically fall into one of two categories: personal computers 
made by companies such as International Business Machines and Apple Computer 
that commonly are found at the home or office, and more sophisticated 
workstations generally used by engineers and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
These markets are dominated by two of the company's most formidable competitors 
-- longtime nemesis IBM and a more recent workstation foe, Sun Microsystems. 
Once the talk of Wall Street, Digital now faces an uphill battle. In trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Digital fell 50 cents to close at $98. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, generally were positive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant announcement," said Jeffrey Canin, a technology analyst at 
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco brokerage. "It's important for Digital's 
future to take advantage of the general migration of users to desktop 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Resolution to Problem 
</P>
<P>
Although the new products represent a major change in Digital's strategy, 
analysts said they may not solve the company's biggest recent problem: a 
slowdown in sales of its most profitable product, the most advanced VAX 
minicomputer. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in November Ken Olsen said the problem with sales was at the high end of 
the line," said Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
"They are adding additional machines at the low end, but that offers no 
resolution to the main problem." 
</P>
<P>
The new products include: 
</P>
<P>
* A family of sophisticated desktop workstations. At the low end is the 
VAXstation 3100, which will be fully compatible with the company's line of VAX 
minicomputers. Prices will start at under $8,000, and shipments are expected as 
early as March. 
</P>
<P>
At the high end is the DECstation 3100, the company's first machine to be based 
on the new, speedy reduced-instruction computer chips. Digital claims that the 
model, priced at $11,900, is the world's fastest desktop workstation. 
Deliveries are scheduled to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
* A line of personal computers built by Tandy Corp., ranging in price from 
$2,630 to $4,960, which will be available this month. The personal computers 
will use the MS-DOS operating system and will be able to work with other MS-DOS 
computers, such as the popular IBM and Compaq models. 
</P>
<P>
* New software, called DECwindows, which allows the new desktop models to share 
information with other Digital machines. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the new products show that Digital finally has understood what 
business customers want: groups of small computers linked together rather than 
a single computer driving and supplying information to a host of terminals with 
no processing power of their own, the type of systems Digital traditionally has 
supplied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Designs 
</P>
<P>
Digital's move also represents several significant breaks from the company's 
tradition of doing things its own way. Not only did Digital introduce desktop 
computers made by Tandy Corp., but some of the models will use operating 
systems and designs, or "architectures," developed outside the company and 
popularized by its primary competitors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the MS-DOS operating system in the personal computers was written 
by Microsoft and was first adopted by IBM. Its top-of-the line DECstation 3100 
will use a version of the UNIX operating system, developed by American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Bell Laboratories and popularized by Sun 
Microsystems. An operating system acts as a computer's traffic cop, directing 
the flow of data in the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Digital's suggested prices for the new machines show that the 
company is serious about making a quick dent in the desktop market. They said 
the company could be firing the first shot in a new round of price wars. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the start of the desktop wars," said UBS Securities analyst Marc 
Shulman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
However, analyst Canin said Digital's low prices probably mean that the 
company's profit margins are slim and high-volume selling will be required for 
Digital to recoup its investment. If the high volumes aren't realized, he said, 
the company's profits will be squeezed.

PAN AM TO SELL CONTRACT SERVICES UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWS $115-MILLION PLANE DEAL WITH BRANIFF 
</P>

<P>
Once-proud Pan Am Corp. said Tuesday that it is putting yet another of its 
properties up for sale in an effort to raise cash to support its money-losing 
airline operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company announced that it wants to sell its contract services division, Pan 
Am World Services. The proposed sale comes less than a week after the carrier 
announced that it was selling to Braniff for $115 million the rights to an 
order of 50 European-made A-320 twin-jet airliners. Pan Am now has a fleet of 
141 airliners. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, portions of Pan Am have been chipped away to raise cash. It 
sold its valuable office building in mid-town New York in 1980. It disposed of 
the Inter-Continental Hotel chain in 1981. In 1986, it sold to United Airlines 
its airline routes in the Pacific for more than $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am World Services, which had revenue of $550 million in 1987 (the company 
has not yet reported 1988 results) and pretax profit of $23 million, provides 
management, housekeeping and technical services for government and commercial 
aerospace projects. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it provides various support services, including security, 
engineering, firefighting and logistics, at the Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida. It operates several airports, including the Westchester County Airport 
outside of New York City and the 30th Street Heliport in mid-Manhattan. It 
participates in the operation of some U.S. military bases and performs pilot 
training for the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commitment to Growth 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am would not say how much money it wants or expects to get for the 
subsidiary. But observers said it is worth about $150 million. Once it is sold, 
Pan Am Corp. will remain the owner only of Pan American World Airways, which 
has lost money throughout the 1980s, its New York-Boston-Washington air 
shuttle, which is making money, and a regional carrier, Pan Am Express, 
formerly Ransome Airlines, which serves 11 cities in the southeastern United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said the proceeds from the sale and 
those from the recent deal with Braniff will be used "to strengthen Pan Am's 
financial and competitive position through further investment in the airline." 
These include, he said, commitments for $61 million for improvements to Pan 
Am's terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York; $25 million for 
refurbishing the interiors of its airliners and $20 million for information 
systems improvements, customer service programs and a series of other related 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In taking this action," Plaskett added, "the board has recognized the progress 
that is being made at Pan Am and has demonstrated its commitment to the growth 
of Pan Am by providing internal sources of capital that will strengthen the 
carrier as it moves ahead with its recovery plan." 
</P>
<P>
But Edward Starkman, airline analyst with the New York investment firm of Paine 
Webber Inc., decried the move. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just what Pan Am should not do," he said. "It should not sell 
money-earning assets to fund the money-losing airline. This is not appealing to 
stockholders."

The dollar finished higher Tuesday against most major currencies in global 
foreign exchange trading despite what dealers described as light dollar-selling 
by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed, falling in New York after rising in Europe. Republic 
National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold as of 4 p.m. EST at $403.80 an 
ounce, down 70 cents from Monday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the European day, after 
opening lower in the wake of central bank intervention on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 1.8300 West German marks for 
most of the day but gathered courage late in the European session after noting 
that the West German Bundesbank had been absent from the open market. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed appeared to have intervened after the dollar edged toward 1.8325 marks 
late in the morning session in New York and reappeared to sell dollars again in 
mid-afternoon when the currency drifted up to about 1.8375 marks, according to 
Daniel Holland, vice president at Discount Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The move was not concerted because the other central banks had already gone 
home for the day," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comments Aid Dollar 
</P>
<P>
But he said the market wanted to know whether the Fed wanted to curb a rise in 
the dollar and found, "The Fed does mean to be here." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rise also was encouraged by reports of comments by Beryl W. 
Sprinkel, the White House chief economic adviser, who questioned the validity 
of central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Holland said the dollar's rise came mainly on speculative activity by 
professionals traders buying to cover earlier promises to sell the dollar 
rather than "real corporate demand for the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
"We have some people throwing in the towel here, saying it doesn't look like 
it's coming down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.39 Japanese yen to 125.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 
126.30 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 126.325 yen from 125.975 yen on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound, which fell to $1.7643 
from $1.7650 late Monday. The dollar also rose against the pound in New York, 
where sterling fell to $1.76475 from $1.77325 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.10 to 
$403.80 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, gold rose in London to $404.75 from $402.75 late Monday; 
climbed to $405.10 in Zurich, Switzerland, from $402.75, and edged up 5 cents 
to $407.23 in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Silver for current delivery slipped 4.7 cents an ounce to $5.916 on the Comex 
in New York. Earlier in London, silver rose to $5.98 from $5.94.

Wall Street broke a four-day winning streak Tuesday, sliding to a modest loss 
after profit taking hit the market at a key technical level. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2,193.21, a decline of 6.25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched index of 30 leading shares was up 5.17 points Monday but it 
failed to close above the key level of 2,200, ending just shy at 2,199.46. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks began the session with a bounce, led by futures-related buying, analysts 
said. But when the programs turned sellers, the market was knocked off its 
perch. 
</P>
<P>
Higher short-term interest rates, unremitting strength in the U.S. economy and 
futures-related selling daunted investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit demoralizing that the market cannot get through that level 
(2,200)," said market analyst Hugh Johnson of First Albany.

Sluggish Market 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market seemed to be catching its breath after having advanced 
in every session of 1989 except the first, setting three post-crash highs in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
There was no major economic news affecting the stock market Tuesday, although 
stocks got continued support from bonds and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose in spite of reports of continued dollar-selling by the Federal 
Reserve, which is trying to restrain the currency's rise. The dollar's strength 
helped buoy bonds, which finished slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, high interest rates, particularly for short-term instruments, 
remain an attractive alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still trying to digest 
stocks dumped on it Monday in a big sell program coordinated by Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co., said Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance Investment 
Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things beyond the power of 
mortal men at times," said Frank Terrizzi, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 140.42 million shares, down from 163.18 
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, share prices finished slightly higher Tuesday, 
after an uneven day that saw sharp movements in several speculative stocks. The 
Financial Times 100-share index ended with a gain of 4.5 points at 1,836.0.

BOND PRICES NUDGED HIGHER BY STRENGTHENING DOLLAR

Bond prices rose slightly in modest trading today, helped by continued strength 
in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or 94 cents per $1,000 
in face value, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell 
to 9.04% from 9.05% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook of a rising dollar helps bond prices by dampening inflation 
prospects and attracting foreign investors to dollar-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the dollar's strength decreases the chance that the Federal 
Reserve will further tighten interest rates, said Robert Chandross, the chief 
economist in the North American head office of Lloyds Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed does not want to raise rates too much because that would make dollars 
even more attractive, Chandross said. The central bank has been trying to hold 
down the dollar through tactics such as sales of dollars in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose Tuesday despite the Fed's limited dollar selling. 
</P>
<P>
Bond trading remained fairly light in the absence of important economic news. 
Traders are looking ahead to Friday's government reports on wholesale prices 
and retail sales, which will give an indication of the inflation outlook. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term government issues were 
1/32 to 3/32 point higher, intermediate maturities were 1/16 point higher and 
long-term issues ranged from 1/16 point to 5/32 point higher, according to 
Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 0.72 to 1,128.70. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate bonds were slightly higher. Moody's investment grade corporate bond 
index, which measures price movements on 80 industrial bonds with maturities of 
five years or longer, rose 0.07 to 294.37. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds was up 7/32 point at 91.5 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield to maturity 
fell to 7.75% from 7.77% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.55% as the discount fell 8 basis 
points to 8.27%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.89% as the discount fell 6 
basis points to 8.41%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.13% as the discount 
fell 2 basis points to 8.46%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.125%, unchanged from late Monday.

President-elect Bush told the National Economic Commission that he wants it to 
present its recommendations for cutting the federal budget deficit March 1 as 
scheduled rather than to continue deliberating until autumn as its leaders had 
hoped. Both Drew Lewis, the NEC's Republican co-chairman, and Robert S. 
Strauss, the panel's Democratic co-chairman, have warned that the commission 
could end up split along party lines if it is forced to meet the deadline. They 
suggested that the NEC could have more impact if the recommendations were 
delayed. The 14-member panel, set up by Congress in 1987, was designed to 
hammer out a bipartisan deficit-cutting plan similar to the way an earlier 
commission formed a new Social Security financing blueprint.

The former law partner of ex-Rep. Mario Biaggi was sentenced to six years in 
prison and fined $222,000 for his role in the Wedtech racketeering case. 
Bernard Ehrlich, 59, who was found guilty of 11 counts of racketeering, 
conspiracy, extortion and bribery, remains free on bail pending appeal. He was 
convicted last summer with Biaggi and three other people of turning the Wedtech 
Corp., the now-defunct South Bronx military contractor, into a racketeering 
enterprise for their personal gain.

Marking the 25th anniversary of Surgeon General Luther L. Terry's landmark 
report Jan. 11, 1964, on smoking and health, current Surgeon General C. Everett 
Koop praised the dramatic changes that have occurred in the nation's smoking 
habits, but urged that efforts be accelerated to discourage more children, 
women, minorities and blue-collar workers from smoking. "In the 1940s and 1950s 
smoking was chic, now, increasingly it is shunned," he said in his annual 
report on smoking. Since 1965, Koop said, nearly half of all living adults who 
have ever smoked have quit.

The Supreme Court, on a 6-3 vote, said that a defendant testifying in his own 
behalf has no right to consult with his lawyer during a brief recess. In 1976, 
the justices said a defendant must be allowed to talk to his lawyer during an 
overnight recess, but the majority refused to extend the ruling. Justice John 
Paul Stevens noted that the defendant in this case was about to be 
cross-examined. "It is entirely appropriate for the trial judge to decide . . . 
that cross-examination is more likely to elicit truthful responses" if the 
witness was not allowed to consult with third parties, Stevens wrote in the 
case (Perry vs. Leeke, 87-6325). The ruling upholds a life sentence given to a 
South Carolina man convicted of murder, kidnaping and assault.

San Francisco police officers used a steel battering ram to smash into an 
apartment where they interrupted an alleged drug deal and set off a shoot-out 
in which two suspects were wounded. Capt. Michael Brush said one group of 
suspects was being ripped off by another group just as the officers entered to 
serve a drug warrant. The suspects reportedly began shooting and the officers 
returned fire. One man was wounded in the knee and another was grazed in the 
head. Nine people were arrested. Officers said they confiscated a large bag 
containing what appeared to be cocaine as well as weapons and ammunition.

Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo explained to President-elect Bush his 
country's concern over the prolonged presence of thousands of Nicaraguan 
Contras in bases in Honduras. "I told him we needed some time . . . to 
formulate our policies," Bush told reporters in a terse statement after the 
30-minute meeting in Washington. Azcona said he outlined for Bush the 
"difficult situation of Honduras in this problem of the Contra revolution." 
Since Congress suspended military aid to the rebels last February, most of the 
estimated 12,500 Contras have suspended operations in Nicaragua and withdrawn 
to bases in Honduras near its border with Nicaragua.

The main Iranian opposition group named 1,107 political prisoners it said have 
been executed by Iran since the August cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War with 
Iraq. In a telegram sent to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, 
Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Iraq-based Moujahedeen organization, said the 
reported figure is only a portion of at least 12,000 political executions 
carried out throughout Iran in the last five months. Rajavi quoted eyewitness 
reports from Iran as saying that a great number of political prisoners have 
been executed in recent weeks with the use of poison gas.

SOVIETS SUSPECTED IN LOSS OF MISSILE PART

The Pentagon is investigating the loss of a flight data recorder from a 
long-range atomic missile test in 1987 and there is a possibility the Soviets 
may have recovered the device, the Pentagon said. The recorder would contain 
valuable information about the performance of the Minuteman 2 missile, 
according to the CBS Evening News, which first reported the story. The missile, 
which carried a dummy warhead, was launched July 7, 1987, in a test shot from 
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California toward Kwajalein Atoll in the western 
Pacific. U.S. officials recovered 400 pounds of debris from a lagoon the next 
morning and shipped it to the United States for analysis, CBS said. But the 
45-day long analysis turned up no sign of the flight data recorder. CBS said 
U.S. officials believe the Soviets, using a small submarine, took the nose 
cone's classified package before the Americans got to the site.

FOR KRUK, 1988 WAS YEAR OF FEAR; 
</P>
<P>
HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE AS FBI CHASED FORMER FRIEND AND HOUSE GUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Kruk, the Padre outfielder who in 1988 had the most disappointing season 
in his professional career, said last week that he lived the season in fear. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk said he was haunted by ongoing FBI surveillance amid an investigation and 
search for former hometown friend Roy Lee Plummer, who has been charged with 
beginning a spree of armed bank robberies shortly before moving into Kruk's 
rented home in San Diego following the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities say Plummer was not staying at Kruk's house during any of 
the alleged robberies, Kruk said he spent last summer being followed by the FBI 
as part of its search for Plummer. He said that as Plummer remained free, he 
was constantly warned by friends and family in his hometown of Keyser, W. Va., 
to "watch yourself." 
</P>
<P>
He said his summer culminated in a visit and questioning by the FBI in August 
during batting practice at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Afterward, he said, 
he became so frightened, "I just didn't care about playing anymore. I'm not 
going to make excuses for anything, but yes, all of this was on my mind. I was 
scared. Yeah, this guy was my friend. But if he did some of the things they 
said he did, you never knew what he might do to me. . . . I mean, I have never 
been so scared in all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer was finally arrested in San Diego last Sept. 19. But Kruk's season was 
shot. After entering it as one of baseball's best young players, he finished as 
one of its most troubled. He hit .241 average (down 72 points from 1987), had 9 
homers (down 11) and 44 RBIs (down 47), and the worst sort of moral defeat. 
Just when he appeared to find his swing, he would lose it. Just when he 
appeared on the verge of breaking out, both his ability and psyche would 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny is usually able to put everything behind him when he takes the field," 
teammate Randy Ready said. "But you could tell he was . . . uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Plummer sits behind bars at the San Diego Metropolitan Correctional 
Center, indicted on five federal counts of armed bank robbery, four in this 
area and one in Maryland; he is being held without bail. Kruk sits in his 
custom house in the West Virginia mountains near his hometown of Keyser, 
wondering how to avoid future collisions of his present and past. 
</P>
<P>
Although teammates have often joked about Kruk's "hillbilly" friends when the 
Keyser bunch attended games in Pittsburgh, this suddenly wasn't funny. Kruk 
wondered if Plummer would find him and harm him. And he felt as if authorities 
were following his every move. 
</P>
<P>
Both fears now seem to have been unfounded. Plummer, who grew up with Kruk in 
Keyser and became a family friend, recently sent Kruk a letter of apology for 
the trouble he caused. And Assistant U.S. Attorney David Katz confirmed that 
Kruk was never under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe John Kruk was involved in any way, and in fact, 
I'm not sure the FBI even followed him," said Katz, who is prosecuting the 
case. "Kruk apparently only shared a place with Plummer and cooperated freely 
with us when we questioned him, and our involvement with him ends there." 
</P>
<P>
Because the case has yet to go to trial, the FBI refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Plummer is accused of robbing a San Diego Home 
Federal Savings and Loan on Oct. 6, 1987. Plummer moved into Kruk's rented 
house sometime thereafter, when Kruk decided to leave San Diego to play winter 
league baseball in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an old friend, a good friend of the family's, and he had stayed with me 
twice the previous summer," said Kruk, who chose not to divulge further details 
of Plummer's stay in his house by request of the FBI. "We've spent hours 
together. He was a great guy, I didn't think it was any big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer eventually moved out. Kruk returned to West Virginia from Mexico to 
finish the offseason with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Then came spring training, and the phone calls from Keyser friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
"They all said the FBI was rooting around asking questions about this guy," 
Kruk said. "They told me that I better be careful, that something was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Kruk says the calls continued into the spring and summer. According to the 
indictment, Plummer committed three more armed bank robberies in San Diego 
County, on May 2, May 10 and June 3. The indictment notes that he wasn't 
necessarily a brilliant thief -- it says he escaped on bicycles and twice lost 
the entire loot when it erupted in his hands because of exploding dye packs. 
Nonetheless, he is charged with taking more than $27,000 total. The FBI knew 
him as the "bandanna bandit" because he covered the lower part of his face with 
a bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
Then in August, while he was dressing in the Jack Murphy Stadium clubhouse 
before a game, Kruk received a phone call from Rhoda Polley, a Padre 
administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"She said there were a couple of guys upstairs who wanted to see me," Kruk 
recalled. "I told her to send them down. Then they walk in the clubhouse and 
flash their badges and I go, 'Whoa.' It was the FBI. Right in front of my 
locker." 
</P>
<P>
The gentlemen escorted Kruk to the bleachers, where during batting practice 
they scared him further. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me things about myself that I didn't even know," Kruk said. "They 
told me everything I had done this year, where I went and who I was. I guess 
they had been following me all during the season. It was really weird." 
</P>
<P>
Kruk said he kept contact with the agents via telephone and that their 
association ended amicably, with one agent jokingly blaming the other for 
causing his bad year. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them not to worry about it," Kruk said. "But I don't know . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, Plummer was finally arrested at a Mission Valley Hotel on the 
local charges and suspicion of nearly a dozen other robberies around the 
country. But because Kruk had heard that another man might have been involved, 
he did not rest easy. He ended the Padres' final homestand staying in a hotel a 
couple of nights and then with Ready for a couple of nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what might happen to me," Kruk said. "If there was another 
person out there . . . I didn't know what danger I was in." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of Kruk's ordeal, Manager Jack McKeon said he was aware of the 
problem but unaware of its effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, Johnny came in and talked to me about it, but it's like a player's 
marital problem or something," McKeon said. "You never know exactly what is 
going on in his mind, and exactly how deep it is hurting him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told Johnny two things. One, they obviously weren't after him, so he 
should stop worrying. And two, this should be a good lesson about picking your 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kruk: "How was I to know? He was always just a regular guy . . . " 
</P>
<P>
With Plummer due to be tried and possibly sentenced by early spring, Kruk hopes 
he will soon feel like a regular guy, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want all of this done, all of this behind me, by the time I get to 
spring training," Kruk said. "I'm feeling healthy, I'm ready to start over." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "If there's one thing I've learned in this last year, it's how to 
deal with the fact that I'm not invincible."

NO NEBRASKA SCHOLARSHIP FOR WAGNER, OSBORNE SAYS 
</P>

The puzzlement over former San Diego State tailback Darrin Wagner's announced 
plans to transfer to Nebraska grew Tuesday when Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said 
he will not offer Wagner a football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't offer him a scholarship when we looked at him out of high school a 
year ago," Osborne said in a telephone interview from Nashville, Tenn., where 
he is attending a convention. "If we didn't recruit him a year ago, why would 
we now?" 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said that as of Tuesday afternoon he had not talked to Wagner. He said 
he did not learn of Wagner's statements that he was transferring to Nebraska, 
published last weekend, until told of them Tuesday by a member of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, The Times' 1987 San Diego County back of the year from Lincoln High 
School, said Tuesday night that he still planned to fly to Lincoln, Neb., 
Thursday and enroll for the spring semester that begins Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be aware that if he comes out, we do not have a scholarship for 
him," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
Darrin's father, Norman, said he talked Tuesday night with Osborne, who told 
him a scholarship would not be offered to his son for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to pay for him to go to Nebraska, we will find a way," Norman 
Wagner said. "He will come out in the spring and show them that he belongs on 
the team. He will earn a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said Wagner's status might have been clarified earlier had SDSU not 
initially denied him permission to talk with Wagner. Under NCAA rules, schools 
must receive permission from the school of a prospective transfer before 
talking to the player. Osborne said he sought permission after Wagner called 
"in October or November" seeking a transfer but was denied in a letter he 
received from Denny Stolz, the former SDSU coach. That permission was granted 
Tuesday, Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had let me talk to him, I would have told him to finish out the year," 
Osborne said. "We never encourage someone to leave school in the middle of his 
first semester." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne also disputed a statement by SDSU Athletic Director Fred Miller that 
Wagner was "tampered" with by "a representative of Nebraska's athletic 
interests." Miller has said that the individual, whom he has declined to 
identify, contacted Wagner while Wagner was a member of the SDSU team and 
improperly influenced him to transfer to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Such actions could violate National Collegiate Athletic Assn. recruiting rules, 
endanger the athlete's eligibility and result in penalties against the 
violating school. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not tampered with Darrin Wagner," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said SDSU's complaints concern Ray Hooper, who was the coach at Lincoln 
High School when Wagner was a freshman. Hooper coached Nebraska quarterback 
Steve Taylor and served as Taylor's legal guardian when Taylor played at 
Lincoln. The Wagners said Hooper is a family friend and that they sought his 
advice because he is familiar with the college recruiting process. Hooper 
accompanied the Wagners to a meeting with Miller and other SDSU officials in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said that Hooper visits Taylor several times a year and is "pretty 
positive about Nebraska," but he said that Hooper does not meet the NCAA 
definition of what is required to be considered "a representative of a school's 
athletic interests." 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules generally define such individuals as financial contributors to a 
university, those who have assisted in the recruitment of athletes for a school 
in the past, those who have helped secure benefits for former athletes and 
anybody else viewed to be operating with the blessing of a university athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray Hooper is not a representative of our athletic interests," Osborne said. 
"He is a good friend of Steve's, apparently a good friend of Darrin's. But we 
never asked Ray to help in recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
It was after Stolz denied Nebraska permission to talk with the Wagners that 
Hooper approached Nebraska about the possibility of Wagner transferring, said 
Dave Gillespie, Nebraska recruiting coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not direct Ray Hooper to do anything," Gillespie said. "Darrin's family 
asked for his help." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said that when Hooper broached the subject with him during the same 
time, he replied, "We can't talk to him. We're not interested in talking to 
him."

CHARGERS, SCHOTTENHEIMER TO TALK AGAIN

Steve Ortmayer and former Cleveland Coach Marty Schottenheimer will meet again 
to discuss the vacant Charger head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
That was the word Tuesday from the Charger front office. Ortmayer, the team's 
director of football operations, was en route to Palo Alto to scout the 
East-West Shrine game and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
It also has been confirmed that Ortmayer has asked the Minnesota Vikings for 
permission to talk to their defensive coordinator, Floyd Peters. Peters has 
never held an NFL head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials said Ortmayer and Schottenheimer met over the weekend in what is 
believed to be the first outside interview since Charger owner Alex Spanos 
fired Coach Al Saunders Dec. 19. Ortmayer already has talked to current Charger 
assistants Ron Lynn, Jerry Rhome and Wayne Sevier about the job. 
</P>
<P>
The word from the Chargers is that Ortmayer still wants to interview George 
Seifert, San Francisco's defensive coordinator, which means the Chargers 
probably won't have a new head coach for at least 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert is preparing for the Jan. 22 Super Bowl. Ortmayer has said he won't 
talk to him until the 49ers' season is over. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer resigned as the Browns' coach after the team lost the Dec. 24 
AFC wild card game to Houston. He and Cleveland owner Art Modell couldn't reach 
an agreement on staff changes proposed by Modell.

TRIP GAVE TORREY PINES GOOD LOOK AT THE BIG BOYS

The Torrey Pines boys' basketball team suffered its first loss of the season in 
the Palms tournament in Ft. Myers, Fla., over the holidays, but it also learned 
it can play with some of the top teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I really take my hat off to the kids," Torrey Pines Coach John Farrell said. 
"We played some great talent, away from home with a 3-hour time difference, 
night after night, and we played well. I'm really proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' biggest victory was against perennial national power Dunbar 
(Washington, D.C.), 67-65. Torrey Pines lost to Miami Carol City, 68-32, in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
But Carol City isn't your typical high school team. Rated No. 8 in the nation 
at the time by USA Today, Carol City has a 7-foot center and two 6-foot 10-inch 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those nights," Farrell said of the loss. "They played their 
best, and we played our worst. They're not 36 points better than us. If we 
played them 10 times, they'd probably beat us 7." 
</P>
<P>
The loss came the day after the victory over Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we just got off to a bad start, and it roller-coasted from there," 
Farrell said. "We played such a hard game the night before and spent a lot of 
energy. And they were big -- they looked more mature than any team we've seen. 
We were a step slow." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines scored the game's first two points, but Miami Carol City then 
reeled off 18 in a row. Torrey Pines never again got close. 
</P>
<P>
Add holiday leftovers: It went nearly unnoticed, but Point Loma's Monica Filer 
set a San Diego Section record for assists in a game (21) in a Dec. 28 victory 
over Bonita Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The Pointers won the game, 56-27. 
</P>
<P>
Filer broke the previous record of 20 set by Hilltop's Mary Hernandez (1985 
against Mar Vista) and El Camino's Sharon Turner (1984 against Basic, Nev.). 
</P>
<P>
In 16 games, Filer has 197 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section Coordinating Council meets this morning and will consider 
making several recommendations at the Board of Managers' meeting Jan. 24: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The maximum number of teams permitted to participate in any one division of 
the section playoffs would be 16. This would affect the basketball playoffs, 
where 19 teams compete in Division I (enrollment of 2,000 or more). The section 
opened the basketball playoffs to all schools for this first time last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rule that gives automatic playoff bids to tri-champions would be 
changed. Before a forfeit last fall, it appeared three football teams from the 
Grossmont 2-A League had earned automatic playoff bids, causing controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boys' volleyball would be moved from spring to fall to coincide with girls' 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The automatic berths to the CIF track preliminaries would be reduced from 
three to two for all 3-A and 2-A leagues and from two to one for the 1-A 
Southern Conference. This recommendation came from the track and field advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego County athletes were named to the Parade All-America football 
team: Morse's Ty Morrison (6-feet 4-inches, 232 pounds) and Vista's Tamasi 
Amituanai (6-3, 295). Morrison was named as a defensive lineman/linebacker and 
Amituanai was chosen as an offensive lineman. At 295 pounds, Amituanai was the 
heaviest player selected. Vista coach Dick Haines called Amituanai the best 
lineman he has seen in 36 years of coaching. . . . Three San Diego-area U.S. 
Junior National Development Camp water polo teams will be picked at Poway High 
School on Saturday at 7 a.m. Coronado water polo Coach Randy Burgess will coach 
the boys' team, and Robin Sanchez of El Capitan and Lynn Garcia of Hilltop will 
co-coach the girls' team. Two boys' teams and a girls' team will be picked. The 
tryout fee is $10. For information, contact Burgess at 522-8926 or Garcia at 
443-1081.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CBS' 'INSIDE EDITION' PUTS A CHILL ON TV'S HARD NEWS COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television needs a lot of things, but not David Frost on a soapbox hosting a 
series. In fact, it may not need Frost at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to set a man free!" Frost, that do-gooder-come-lately, announced at 
the top of Monday's premiere of "Inside Edition" on KCBS-TV Channel 2. That man 
is James Richardson, who has spent 20 years in prison for the murder of his 
children in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the show's own investigation, "I think James Richardson is innocent!" 
Frost proclaimed. Yippee. 
</P>
<P>
If ever a single revolting performance epitomized a show seeking to whip 
viewers into a frenzy, it was that of the huffing, puffing Frost on the opener 
of "Inside Edition," a new, syndicated tabloid series that splashes "the new 
face of reality" across the screen. You may prefer the old face. 
</P>
<P>
The marginally older face that "Inside Edition" supplanted on Channel 2 is "USA 
Today: The Television Show," which offered its own "new look" in its debut 
Monday on KNBC Channel 4. You may prefer no look. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to news, Channel 2 at least gets credit for bizarre eclecticism 
as it continues its eternal struggle to rise from overall third-place in the 
ratings among local network-owned stations. Its new youth brigade of local 
newscasters gives way to the nerve-jangling-Dr. Strangelove-tight Dan Rather, 
who has now become the lead-in for the 7 p.m. "Inside Edition," which has been 
shaped by John Tomlin and Bob Young, former producers of Fox Broadcasting's "A 
Current Affair." 
</P>
<P>
Television is becoming a landfill for junk news, and there may be no turning 
back. Given the popularity of "A Current Affair" and the incestuousness of the 
industry, it's no accident that larger and larger chunks of television are 
resembling the tabloid racks at supermarket check-out counters. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you had to admit that Jon Scott's story on Richardson did have heat and 
passion, perhaps because the field producer was Craig Rivera, brother of 
hot-and-passionate Geraldo Rivera and former employee of "Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
In the bold tradition of yellow journalism, moreover, "Inside Edition" favors 
advocacy over straight reporting, its points of view arriving on the tips of 
nuclear warheads. So what if the Richardson story fell just short of declaring 
outright that he was "set up" by corrupt authorities? Frost was there to tidy 
up that loose end himself: 
</P>
<P>
"How on earth can society pay its debt to James Richardson for 20 years of 
anguish and pain? We'll come back to that in another program. Right now, the 
first priority is to set him free." 
</P>
<P>
Frost urged viewers to write Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and demand that 
Richardson be set free "not next month or next year -- but now! This week! By 
lunchtime tomorrow! If only on parole for a start." 
</P>
<P>
Following the commercial break, it was on to another story, this one about the 
placing of newspaper ads alleged making false promises through special-exchange 
telephone numbers. Ace reporter Marguerite Bardone and a camera crew ambushed 
and harassed the alleged culprit -- Robert Spanville of New York -- as he 
pushed a stroller on a Manhattan street, accompanied by a small girl who 
appeared to be his daughter or grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Spanville eventually gave up trying to mislead us about his ad," the 
smirking Bardone reported. The nerve of him for even trying. 
</P>
<P>
After making a case against Spanville, Bardone claimed that despite his 
denials, he is being investigated by the New York State Attorney General's 
Office and that "criminal and civil prosecutions may follow." The operative 
word here is may. And if Spanville isn't prosecuted? Not to worry, for "Inside 
Edition" has already prosecuted -- and convicted him -- on television. 
</P>
<P>
Well, what to make of all of this? 
</P>
<P>
Richardson -- who made a compelling defense in his own behalf on the show -- 
may indeed have been "set up." And Spanville may actually be the scum that he 
is alleged to be. 
</P>
<P>
But that's for viewers to decide, not a tawdry, rouged-up streetwalker in hot 
pants like "Inside Edition," whose self-parodying anchor sits in a mock, 
three-tiered news set occupied by choreographed extras who move about and 
rustle papers -- probably copies of The Star -- on cue. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who popped up in syndication last year with a series of serious 
interviews with the U.S. presidential candidates, capped the first half-hour of 
"Inside Edition" with a pathetic comedy monologue titled "Frost Bites," 
followed by a promise that the series would include "no three-headed babies. No 
programs devoted to issues like: Should one-legged lesbians be allowed to adopt 
ferrets? No sex surveys. And hopefully, no broken noses for the host." Get it? 
</P>
<P>
How on earth can Channel 2 repay viewers for the anguish and pain of watching 
this show? By freeing the airwaves of "Inside Edition." Not next month or next 
year -- but now! This week! By lunchtime tomorrow! 
</P>
<P>
If "Inside Edition" is your basic screamer, "USA Today: The Television Show" 
continues to be a half hour lacking a pulse on Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
Many expected the much-hyped "USA Today: The Television Show" to ravage the 
competition when it premiered on Channel 2 last fall in the 7 p.m. war zone, an 
especially critical and competitive time period regarded as the gateway to the 
rest of the TV evening. 
</P>
<P>
The series had a disappointing start here and elsewhere, however, victimized by 
its own plastic hipness and shallow, abbreviated stories that reminded you of 
exclamation points without sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The "new look" series is surely better than the original, having scrapped its 
fluid, strolling-anchors format and emphasized content almost as much as style. 
</P>
<P>
Edie Magnus and Bill Macatee now sit behind a traditional anchor desk in the 
Rosslyn, Va., studio, while Robin Young reports from the West. But "USA Today: 
The Television Show" remains a show without an apparent plan or purpose beyond 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Although stories are generally longer than before, the U.S. Supreme Court's 
decision to again reconsider a woman's legal right to abortion was given a mere 
30 seconds Monday. The point is: Why even do a story that inevitably would 
dominate regular newscasts in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
The program opened a weight reduction series with good information -- but 
information that was already available on that day's edition of "Sally Jessy 
Raphael." A piece on the coming inauguration was essentially vapid, and the 
half-hour's strongest story -- Young's report from a Las Vegas electronic show 
-- was nice, but nothing to build a program around. 
</P>
<P>
The final story -- about mummification -- seemed ominously applicable to "USA 
Today: The Television Show" itself, a series wrapped in an aura of doom. The 
worst thing that could happen to it has happened. There is simply no compelling 
reason to watch.

DEUKMEJIAN CALLS FOR 19% CUT IN STATE ARTS COUNCIL BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has proposed a 19% budget reduction for the state agency 
that provides grants and technical assistance to artists and nonprofit arts 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's budget released Tuesday proposes a $3-million cut in the 
California Arts Council's current $15.6-million budget. Deukmejian's 
$12,610,000 proposal for fiscal year 1989-90 marks the largest reduction in the 
council's budget that the governor has recommended since he took office in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
The matter must now go before the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. If 
passed and signed into law, the new budget goes into effect on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this (would be) a tremendous hardship for the field," said council 
Chairman Harvey Stearn. "Our job will be to effect the cuts that have the least 
possible impact on" artists and organizations that receive council support. 
</P>
<P>
The council had recommended to the governor a $2.3 million increase to its 
current budget, which includes about $1 million in federal funds, said council 
director and Deukmejian-appointee Robert H. Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the governor's action, Reid added that Deukmejian made his reduction 
proposal "without any malice" toward the council and that the governor's hand 
was forced largely by Proposition 98, which guarantees public schools roughly 
40% of the state's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP-dominated 11-member council has agreed unanimously -- if the proposal 
becomes law -- to trim $2.8 million from its 10 grant programs (totaling $12.6 
million) and the rest from council operating expenses, Stearn said. The cuts 
will be made "across the board," and no programs will be eliminated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This preserves all the programs and keeps the possibility of restoring them 
back to previous levels at a later date," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the council is probably doing the best thing in its plan to 
execute the cuts," said Susan Hoffman, director of the California Confederation 
of the Arts, an arts advocacy organization. "But, holy cow, $3 million is a 
whole lot of arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Council funding is already so incredibly competitive," Hoffman added. "Within 
the organizational grant category, one out of three applicants now gets 
funding, and for artists fellowships, it's one out of 10." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, agreed that the 
budget reduction could be "crippling." Noting the recent creation of the Los 
Angeles Endowment for the Arts, which is slated to add about $20 million 
annually to the city's arts budget, Davidson said: "We are at too important a 
junction in the history of the development of the arts in the state to take a 
step back now." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his administration, Deukmejian reduced the council's budget by more 
than $2 million during a budget shortfall when all state agencies suffered 
heavy cuts, a council spokeswoman said. Otherwise, the governor has increased 
council funding annually, by at least $800,000 and as much as nearly $2 
million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Assembly Ways and Means Committee reported that California will 
be $1.5 billion short of what it will need to adequately finance state programs 
in its 1989-90 budget. 
</P>
<P>
California currently ranks 35th nationwide in per capita arts funding, 
according to the Washington D.C.-based National Assembly of State Arts 
Agencies.

L.A. CHOREOGRAPHERS AMONG GRANT AWARDEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choreographer Anthony V. Shay of Los Angeles has been recognized with a $10,000 
National Endowment for the Arts grant. Also receiving $7,000 awards were 
choreographers Mary Jane Eisenberg, Linda J. Sohl-Donnell, Fred Strickler, and 
Santa Monica's Raiford C. Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 86 professional choreographers were awarded a total of $804,000 in 
federal grants. Known as Choreographers' Fellowships, the $15,00, $10,000 and 
$7,000 grants were given to recipients from a pool of 631 applicants and 
awarded to dancers in 12 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Four 
three-year fellowships of $45,000 were also awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Fellowship funds can be used for any project or activity that will aid the 
choreographer's creative development.

ABC ADDS 2 DRAMAS TO PRIME-TIME LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two new drama series were added to the ABC prime-time schedule Tuesday as the 
network reshuffled its lineup to eliminate the Saturday-night movie block. 
</P>
<P>
The new shows are "A Man Called Hawk," a spinoff from "Spenser: For Hire" that 
stars Avery Brooks, and "Studio 5B," a "Broadcast News" imitation about the 
people who run a network morning program. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's new Saturday schedule as of Jan. 28 will be "Mission: Impossible" at 8 
p.m, "A Man Called Hawk" at 9 p.m. and "Murphy's Law" at 10 p.m. "Studio 5B" 
will premiere Jan. 29 in the 8 p.m. Sunday slot now occupied by "Mission: 
Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, ABC said that Christina Ferrare, already the 
co-host of "AM Los Angeles" on KABC-TV Channel 7 and the network's "Incredible 
Sunday," will replace Sandy Hill as co-host of the daytime "Home" program. Her 
first appearance with Robb Weller will be Monday, when the weekday show expands 
from 30 minutes to one hour a day. 
</P>
<P>
ABC did not offer an explanation for the change in personnel.

MINORITIES IN TV: BLACK, WHITE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Gail Cameron can laugh about it now, but a tinge of anger still creeps 
into her voice when she recalls auditioning last year for the role of a court 
reporter in a situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The casting director had told her earlier that the role called for her to "be 
professional" in the courtroom, and "relaxed and more animated" when in the 
judge's chambers. 
</P>
<P>
When she arrived to read for the director and producer, the instructions became 
more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they wanted me to be like Vanna White while in the courtroom and 
like Marla Gibbs when I was in the judge's chambers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Her 'Normal Self' 
</P>
<P>
After a run-through, the director said her courtroom performance was just fine, 
but asked if she could "get down" in the judge's chambers, just be her "normal 
self." Cameron could hear what was coming, but she patiently re-read the part. 
Finally, the director told her exactly what for him was the heart of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you be more black?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron exploded. "I told him that I've been black all my life and this is the 
way that I and most of the black people I know talk," she said. "I asked him, 
'How would you act if I asked you to act more white?' I guess they wanted to 
show that black people may sound like the rest of the world in the working 
environment, but they are actually different behind closed doors. Needless to 
say, I didn't get the job." 
</P>
<P>
To many in and around Hollywood, that incident means more than the failure of 
one actor or actress to get a TV role; it tells where blacks and other 
minorities seem to fit into the most powerful and influential medium in 
America, and ultimately where they seem to fit in the minds of Americans as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
While the director's biased view merely reflects attitudes and misinformation 
that many individual Americans share, when he shapes a character for the 
television program, his impression of minorities will be multiplied a 
million-fold week after week. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with nearly 100 actors, writers, producers, casting directors, 
advertising executives, film and television critics, psychologists and 
psychiatrists -- both minority and non-minority -- make clear that a similar 
scenario is played out daily in all of America's visual mediums -- television, 
movies, commercials and music videos. 
</P>
<P>
The result, these experts say, is that those mediums, the most powerful molders 
of public opinion, taste and attitude, reinforce and magnify the gap between 
whites and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising executives say there is fear in corporate offices across the nation 
that using minorities in commercials will keep ad messages from connecting or 
actually turn off white consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, black actors are steered away from certain commercials, while 
television spots identical to the ones on network television are often made 
with Latinos and Asians, but aired only on Spanish-language or Asian-oriented 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry contend that white film and television executives are 
leery of dramatic programs centered on a minority character because they think 
whites aren't interested in seeing them. And, they say, when white writers, 
directors and producers do make such programs, their limited perception of 
minorities is often drawn from earlier distorted movie and television 
stereotypes. Consequently, they further perpetuate the myths. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of minorities who work in similar capacities are confined 
mostly to minority projects and seldom are involved as writers, director or 
producers of films, television shows or commercials about whites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microcosm of Society 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're really seeing is a metaphor of what it is to be a minority 
in the society," said film and television producer Carol Isenberg. "You're 
seeing in media a microcosm of the larger society." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, this does not seem to square with evidence that shows 
minorities atop nearly every major entertainment field. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cosby, for instance, has been America's favorite father on the nation's 
No. 1 show for the last three years. Eddie Murphy is the biggest single box 
office draw in the movie industry, with films that have made nearly a billion 
dollars in the last five years. Oprah Winfrey has replaced a white male, Phil 
Donahue, as the nation's No. 1 daytime talk show host. Chicago Bulls basketball 
star Michael Jordan rakes in millions of dollars in commercial endorsements -- 
far more than white sports celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
But those successes and the images they create obscure the deeper problem, many 
inside Hollywood and the advertising industry say. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't concentrate on the top of the pyramid," said Rodney Mitchell, the 
affirmative action administrator with the Screen Actors Guild. "If you do, 
you'll get a distorted and misleading picture. You've got to look at the heart 
and soul, the performers who make up the body of those films and programs and 
advertisements. That's where you make the real difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13 Minority Characters 
</P>
<P>
Although the Screen Actors Guild contract prods advertisers, film and 
television studios to present "a more accurate view of the American scene," 
there are relatively few minority members among the hundreds of characters 
Americans tune in to see daily. For example, at ABC, on more than 100 shows 
with hundreds of roles, only 13 minority characters -- 12 blacks and one 
Eurasian -- are regularly being portrayed each week. The numbers at CBS are 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, currently the top-rated network, is far ahead of the others with 38 
regular minority characters. It has four all-black shows and four dramatic 
series with minority central characters. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Screen Actors Guild, while blacks, Latinos, Asians and 
American Indians account for about 22% of the nation's population, they made up 
13% of the on-camera appearances in film, television and commercials in 1987. 
But critics argue that even those numbers distort the story. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't tell you the quality, the depth of the role," Mitchell said. "They 
don't say whether it was a lead role, a supporting role, or just a person who 
appeared in the film." 
</P>
<P>
"Minorities are treated as exotics," said Albert Johnson, professor of cinema 
studies at UC Berkeley and longtime director of the San Francisco Film 
Festival. "Most shows say that they're not part of the mainstream. You are not 
part of what makes the system go." 
</P>
<P>
"Minorities are seldom the central theme of a show," actor-producer Robert 
Hooks said. "Just think about all those made-for-TV movies about a woman who is 
dealing with divorce, or wife abuse or a family that has had some dramatic 
circumstance in their life. . . . Minorities deal with these same problems 
(but) we seem to be presented in a separate category. We don't just deal with 
discrimination and gangs and crime. We have human, American stories to tell. 
Why aren't minorities presented in those lights?" 
</P>
<P>
Executives at CBS and ABC declined to discuss the use of minorities in their 
programs, but at NBC, Warren Littlefield, vice president in charge of 
prime-time programs, said the network has made increased minority images part 
of its programming priorities, and it has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we woke up a while ago when we were in third place and we noticed that 
our shows lacked a variety of character," Littlefield said. "We just set out in 
our development to try and do a more interesting picture, and one that more 
reflected the population that was out there in society. Our goal is not to hold 
up a mirror to society. Our goal is to entertain. But I do think we can 
entertain with characters that reflect society." 
</P>
<P>
But industry critics complain that while NBC is far ahead of the other networks 
in minority characters, it still largely represents a "sitcom ghetto." Of the 
38 minority characters on NBC, 26 are on all-black situation comedies. 
</P>
<P>
"Dating from the time of slavery, whites, and some blacks, have seen blacks as 
comedians, comics, the clowns," said Dr. Alvin Pouissant, psychiatrist, Harvard 
University faculty member and script consultant to Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Black Drama Series 
</P>
<P>
"So, when the networks think black, they think comedy. There are no drama 
series, no black soaps, no black Dynasties or Dallases. That's part of a legacy 
of a racially determined perspective. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Latinos and Asians, however, could argue that even a sitcom would be a step 
forward. There are currently no programs of any kind on either network built 
around Latino or Asian characters. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Hispanic point of view, by and large, prime-time television says 
Hispanics are not part of America," said Ed Cervantes, Columbia Pictures vice 
president in charge of comedy and current programs for television. "The Asian 
community could say the same thing. If you do exist, you do so in stereotypical 
roles. It feeds you images to live down to and not those to live up to. It's 
saying to our youth that there's nothing that exists for you." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, questions of a lack of balanced minority presentation must go to 
the genesis of programs and commercials, to the writers, producers, casting 
directors, advertising and the studio executives who create the programs. 
According to industry experts and studies, racial discrimination and bias have 
kept their ranks overwhelmingly white. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at me for example," Cervantes at Columbia Pictures said. "I'm the 
only Hispanic who has a job like this in the entire industry at the studio or 
at a major studio. There are a few in the feature area at smaller independent 
studios. And I've been the only Hispanic doing this job since I got into it in 
1981. The television industry has always thought of itself as more liberal than 
the rest of society. But it's not. People tend to hire who they know, who they 
are comfortable with, who they are familiar with. And that's usually not us." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schultz, who is one of the handful of successful minority film 
directors, adds that minority members are pigeonholed when it comes to the kind 
of work they can expect. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the films that blacks and other minorities produce, those films 
are comedies or music-related or action movies," he said. "You don't get the 
so-callled 'serious film,' the drama, the pieces that are literate." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Morones, who has cast numerous television shows and movies, said that 
despite his accomplishments, it is still tough sledding. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I won the equivalent of the Academy Award for casting for my work on 
'Platoon,' " he said. "Still, I'm lucky if I do two films a year. If I were 
white, I'd be working all the time. Everybody who gets a Hispanic project calls 
me, but that's usually after they're dissatisfied with the white casting 
director they already have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roles Begin With Writers 
</P>
<P>
But roles begin with writers. According to a Screen Writers Guild study of 
hiring practices from 1982 to 1985, racial discrimination accounted for 
minorities making up only 2% of the writers employed each year in films and TV. 
</P>
<P>
"There are entire segments of the industry that are virtually inaccessible to 
minority writers," the study said. "Preconceived notions among those who hire 
writers may shape the opportunities of . . . minority writers more than the 
talents of individual writers would warrant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is that white people can write for anyone, but black people can 
only write for blacks," charges Daryl G. Nickens, who has written for "Benson," 
"Webster," and "Bustin' Loose." "If you say this, everyone is going to deny 
that this is true and point to the exceptions to the rule." 
</P>
<P>
When whites attempt to fashion viewing to appeal to a broad audience, their 
personal perception of what the public thinks of minorities and what they 
themselves think of minorities is ultimately reflected in commercials, 
television programs and film. 
</P>
<P>
Many times those perceptions are misshaped racial stereotypes bred of 
ignorance, bias or even absorption of false images through the mediums in which 
they now operate, critics claim. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got studio executives who do not know blacks or do not know Hispanics 
or Asians," Cervantes at Columbia Pictures said. "They do not eat with them, do 
not lunch with them, do not play with them. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got writers and producers in the exact same scenario, casting directors 
who only know minorities through 8-by-10 glossies or because they had 
previously cast them in a part. 
</P>
<P>
"What they do know about minorities, they know from what they've seen on 
television, and then they write about minorities from what they've seen on TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Our social acceptance in Hollywood is very minimal," added television and film 
producer Topper Carew. "There is no dialogue on the human level or a social 
level that helps bridge this gap that exists between so many of us. So a lot of 
the people who we deal with in this business deal with us on a stereotypical 
basis. They stereotype the cast coming through the door." 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield of NBC said certainly some of that is true. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in a network or in any situation where people get into the power 
seat (is that they) become removed from everything," he said. "I'm influenced 
mostly by my high school and childhood upbringing, where I had a large number 
of minority friends. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the eighth grade, I was bused from a primarily white 
neighborhood in Montclair, N.J., to an inner-city black neighborhood and a 
predominately black school. The high school I went to was about one-third 
black. I ended up making a lot of longtime black friends. I find that is 
unusual compared to the population that I interact with as an executive today." 
</P>
<P>
Either as they attempt to gauge society's intolerance or as a result of their 
own biases, those in control make decisions that perpetuate the gap between the 
races, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"In advertising, there is some reticence on the part of clients in certain 
categories to use minorities or blacks," said Tom Burrell, president of Burrell 
Advertising Agency in Chicago. "You won't see much in cosmetics, hair care, 
personal hygiene or feminine hygiene, things to do with personal care, 
especially as it relates to beauty. I think it's because there's the feeling 
that the standards of American beauty are still decidedly white. That's despite 
the fact that white women and models are going out and getting cosmetic surgery 
to puff up their lips, get their hair frizzed and trying to get suntans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Breakthroughs' 
</P>
<P>
"I h Pe had companies say to me personally that, 'I don't want to depreciate my 
company by having it identified with the black community,' " said Earl Graves, 
publisher of Black Enterprise, a national business magazine oriented toward 
blacks. "There are some breakthroughs, but there are still companies concerned 
about the racist tendencies that might exist in the general market. So they 
leave black people out so as not to offend what they perceive as their base 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Jones, of the Carolyn Jones Advertising agency in New York, said some 
clients have pulled back advertisements featuring blacks because they felt 
their product was being viewed as "too black." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads for Luxury Products 
</P>
<P>
"That would happen particularly if the market studies showed that a large 
percentage of their consumers were black," she said. "They felt that if white 
people perceived the product as largely consumed by blacks, they would not want 
to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Makers of luxury products are often disinclined to use minorities in ads or 
seek minority customers, Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more upscale products feel that by using minorities, it may take away some 
of the sophistication, the specialness, the exclusivity of their products," he 
said. "That's a racist response. In fact, every study out there shows that 
given the choice, minorities, particularly blacks, go for the higher priced, 
more quality product." 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, those who have pursued projects centered on minority characters 
often complain that America can identify with minorities as comedians, but is 
not prepared to accept them as central characters in drama -- as whole human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's considered a gamble," award-winning producer Stan Margulies said. "The 
classic opinion is that the audience responds to someone like themselves who 
has a problem to solve. There are those who say the audience will not identify 
with a Latino or a black or an Asian or a Native American. They are different. 
That's the conventional thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Tim Reid, who has co-starred in three television series and co-produced 
the highly regarded but recently canceled "Frank's Place," said he encountered 
that problem recently when he proposed to studio executives the true story of a 
single black man in Columbus, Ohio, who has adopted 36 children, five of whom 
he sent to college. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked at me and said, 'What's the story?' " he said. "Three white guys 
adopt one baby in 'Three Men and a Baby' and it's a movie, but this guy has 
adopted 36 children with no government assistance, no wife, didn't take the 
easier route of being a foster parent and they say, 'What's the story?' " 
</P>
<P>
A lead role played by Willem Dafoe in the Academy Award-winning movie "Platoon" 
was originally written for an Apache. "The (film) distribution people turned it 
around and said, 'Why don't you make this guy a white guy,' " recalled Morones, 
the casting director. "Even some of the best ideas get turned around because of 
old racist concepts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17 Years of Experience 
</P>
<P>
Morones, who has 17 years of casting experience in television and film, recalls 
that when he wanted to do a show about the up-from-the-streets story of Latino 
boxing champion Paul Gonzalez, the studio executives wanted to center the show 
around a white policeman who had influenced Gonzalez instead of around 
Gonzalez. "They felt you needed a white lead to make people tune in," Morones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same story when San Francisco attorney David Minami and Los Angeles 
producer Joan Marks proposed the dramatic story of Fred Korematsu, a 
Japanese-American whose wrongful conviction during World War II gave legal 
justification for the internment of Japanese-Americans during the war. That 
decision was overturned by a federal judge in 1983, laying the groundwork for 
reparations to those interned or their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and CBS turned down the project immediately. ABC took a run at it, and even 
called for a script, but later backed off. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't feel that the American public would be sufficiently interested in 
an Asian-American story, which many people wanted to forget," Marks said. 
"There are lots of rationalizations. Is there an Asian-American star big enough 
for people to tune in? Was the script good enough? But if it was the same story 
and it was all Caucasian, it would be done in two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
They gave Margulies a similar argument 10 years ago when he wanted to do a 
mini-series about a black family during slavery. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Who is going to tune in on a show that is basically about black 
people,' " Margulies said. "The conventional wisdom was that white America 
might tune in for 10 minutes and say, 'Oh, it's about blacks,' and tune out." 
</P>
<P>
The series was "Roots," still the highest-rated mini-series in the history of 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"The avalanche of enthusiasm after the show aired was overwhelming and everyone 
was dancing in the aisles," Margulies said. "But the hard fact is that in the 
years that followed, there were very few serious shows about blacks in America. 
I like to think that television can be an incredible unifying force, and 
certainly for the week 'Roots' was on the air, it was. But it takes more than 
one book, one television show, one anything to make a lasting impact."

KADAFI'S REVOLUTIONARY DREAMS BECOMING FRAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
TRIPOLI, Libya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a busload of foreign journalists was being expelled from Libya the other 
day, it passed a small, straggling line of people shuffling into a stadium near 
the Aziziya barracks, where Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, nearly lost 
his life in the U.S. air strike on Tripoli three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The people were members of what the Libyan media call "the heroic masses," and 
they were being summoned to yet another "popular rally" staged to show how 
steadfast Libya remains in confronting "American terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
A few in the ragged crowd glanced up at the reporters as the bus inched its way 
through the congested traffic. But apparently being under no obligation to 
demonstrate until they reached the rally, they looked away again, expressions 
of boredom or perhaps resignation etched on drawn and tired faces. 
</P>
<P>
Even on a very short visit to Libya -- short because of the sudden and 
still-unexplained decision to expel the journalists -- it was clear that the 
mood here has mellowed considerably since April, 1986, when U.S. warplanes 
attacked Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for Libya's alleged involvement in 
the bombing of a Berlin discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
There was ample evidence, even then, that ordinary Libyans were becoming 
increasingly fed up with their never-ending revolution, the Orwellian 
double-speak of its ubiquitous slogans and the economic hardships it was 
forcing them to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they could be counted upon to report for demonstrations when the need 
arose, put on a half-hearted show of steadfastness and plaster the city with 
new portraits of Kadafi and posters denouncing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, there were far fewer demonstrations, and those attending 
them seemed even less enthusiastic. Anti-American posters were also notably 
absent, although the United States has not exactly endeared itself to most 
Libyans by shooting down two of their jet fighters last week or by threatening 
to blow up what they have been led to believe is only an innocent 
pharmaceutical plant. 
</P>
<P>
There are still posters of Kadafi on the streets, but most of them are worn and 
frayed, their torn edges fluttering in the gentle sea breeze that, from time to 
time, caresses this cheerless city like an act of pity or kindness. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, this seems appropriate. For, like the old posters, the revolution's 
dreams are also frayed. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, Kadafi's adventures beyond his own shores have all failed. Some 
have done so spectacularly, like his military rout from Chad two years ago. 
Others, such as his efforts to promote Arab unity, have either just fizzled or 
been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Second Nasser 
</P>
<P>
These failures have frustrated Kadafi, who wanted his fellow Arabs to think of 
him as a second Gamel Abdel Nasser, the late and -- in his lifetime -- 
immensely popular Egyptian leader. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, across the length and breadth of the Arab world, from the Persian Gulf 
to North Africa, Kadafi is almost universally regarded as a clown -- and a 
demented one at that. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in desperation, Kadafi turned to terrorism, supporting radical groups 
from the Azores to what is now Zimbabwe. All that earned him, however, was the 
enmity of the West, in particular the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, he seemed to thrive on this. If he couldn't win the world's 
admiration, he could at least earn its disapproval, which was still a form of 
the attention he seemed so desperately to crave. 
</P>
<P>
That also seemed fitting, for Kadafi, who on more than one occasion has 
compared himself to the Prophet Mohammed and to Jesus Christ, still appears to 
hold a grudge against the world for its failure to embrace the "Green Book" in 
the way that it has the Koran or the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Eclectic Anthology 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi's "Green Book" is an eclectic anthology of his thoughts and sayings, 
ranging from art and religion to politics and sports. In it is the "Third 
Universal Theory," which is meant to succeed where communism and capitalism 
have both failed in bestowing political enlightenment upon the world. It is 
chock-a-block with such enlightening stuff as: "The party system aborts 
democracy" and "Democracy is popular rule, not expression." 
</P>
<P>
This sort of double-speak still abounds and is to be found on everything from 
the brass plaques above the reception counters at Libyan hotels to the 
cellophane wrapping on rolls of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
But the striking thing about Libya today is that no one seems to pay much 
attention to the slogans or the ideology any more. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, anyone tuning in to one of Libya's two television stations 
could choose between a documentary on the achievements of the revolution or an 
entertainer, usually Maltese, belting out sayings from the "Green Book" set to 
the tune of a pulsating rock beat. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the evening TV fare usually consists of more conventional variety 
shows and less politicized panel discussions. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other, more significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the power of the dreaded "revolutionary committees" -- 
which functioned like fascist youth squads or, in the Libyan context, what one 
observer called "green thought police" -- has been sharply curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
Private enterprise, banned until only six months ago, is flourishing once more, 
albeit on a small scale. The once shuttered souk is again a bustling 
marketplace where vendors hawk wares ranging from black-market Marlboros to car 
stereos and Turkish-made blue jeans at $30 per pair. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi has opened up his borders with Tunisia, permitting the import of 
foodstuffs and other consumer goods, signed a truce with Chad and moved to 
relax his tense relations with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and other neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The colonel, who once looked to Nasser's Egypt for political inspiration and to 
Mao Tse-tung's China as a model for social reform, now seems to have found a 
new role model -- the perestroika of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union. 
Inevitably perhaps, diplomats here have dubbed Kadafi's reforms "green 
perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
These changes, the diplomats add, have done much to bolster Kadafi's sagging 
popularity, which hit a nadir in 1987 with the rout of Libyan forces from Chad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aura of Impermanence 
</P>
<P>
But, however remarkable, the reforms still seem to have an aura of impermanence 
about them. The vendors in the souk sell their wares from cardboard boxes. They 
are here today but could just as easily be gone tomorrow. The shopkeepers 
themselves remain nervous. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the excesses of the revolutionary committees have been curbed, 
political freedoms remain severely restricted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many layers of control in this country," one Western 
ambassador said. "While people are less afraid than before, they are still 
afraid. No one will express his opinion." 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there is still the matter of the chemical plant at Rabta, 
a remote and heavily fortified desert encampment in the bleak foothills of the 
Tripoli mountains 40 miles southwest of the capital. The Libyans insist that 
the plant is being built to manufacture pharmaceuticals. The United States, 
citing "conclusive evidence" obtained from intelligence channels, says that, 
when completed, the plant will be the largest facility in the Third World for 
the production of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyans, in an effort to support their case, allowed more than 200 
journalists into Tripoli last week and took them to Rabta over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The visit, however, only reinforced suspicions that there was something to 
hide. The journalists were not allowed to inspect the plant and got only a 
brief glimpse of the unlit complex from the windows of their moving bus in the 
dead of night. Then they were taken back to Tripoli and promptly told to pack 
their bags and leave.

MEXICO ARRESTS POWERFUL BOSS OF PEMEX UNION

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unprecedented blow against organized labor, the Mexican government 
Tuesday arrested the powerful leader of the national oil workers union in a 
military raid that officials said netted hundreds of automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina, was detained at his Ciudad Madero 
home in the coastal state of Tamaulipas after a shoot-out between his 
bodyguards and federal police backed by the army. A federal agent was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The government news agency Notimex reported that security forces blew down La 
Quina's front door with a bazooka. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo told reporters that 34 other union 
members were arrested or turned themselves in to authorities. He said Hernandez 
Galicia would be charged with arms trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
In a related case, the attorney general said prominent businessman Sergio 
Bolanos, a reputed front man for Hernandez Galicia, and several of his 
associates were detained on charges of evading $1.5 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Hernandez Galicia, a popular and reputedly corrupt union boss set 
off a demonstration by thousands of angry oil workers through the streets of 
Mexico City and wildcat strikes in at least half of the refineries of Petroleos 
Mexicanos, the national oil company known as Pemex. The army occupied two of 
the refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the world's 6th-largest petroleum producer and the chief supplier of 
the United States' strategic oil reserves. The sagging Mexican economy is 
dependent on the dollars earned from international oil sales. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, police surrounded the headquarters of the Mexican Workers 
Congress, the official labor umbrella group to which the oil workers union 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
The congress is one of the pillars of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, known by its initials as the PRI. Party sources said the politically 
charged decision to arrest Hernandez Galicia could only have been made 
personally by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman, who declined to be identified, asserted that the oil 
workers were conspiring against the government. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a decision by the state for reasons of national security. The oil 
workers had a plan to take over strategic installations of Pemex to destabilize 
the country and show their force against the government," he said. "This 
decision ends the long history of blackmail and corruption on the part of the 
(oil union leaders) . . . a small group who acted outside the law." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials countered that their leader were framed for political reasons, 
a charge that Alvarez del Castillo denied. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said the army found more than 200 Uzi submachine guns, 17 
other high caliber weapons and 25,000 rounds of ammunition in the modest home 
that serves as the union leader's headquarters. The 66-year-old Hernandez 
Galicia is the power behind the union of almost 200,000 members, although the 
secretary general is Salvador Barragan Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
Barragan Camacho told reporters in Mexico City that he escaped arrest because 
he had left his suburban home for an early dental appointment before soldiers 
arrived for him. The union leader said Hernandez Galicia had been arrested in 
his underwear by soldiers who planted the weapons in his house. 
</P>
<P>
Barragan Camacho spent the morning at the headquarters of the Workers Congress 
and then disappeared. The attorney general said he had offered to turn himself 
in but had not done so yet. 
</P>
<P>
Among those detained with Hernandez Galicia were Jose Sosa Martinez, a former 
secretary general of the union, and J. Concepcion Ortega Kuri, coordinator of 
the political affairs for the union. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Galicia built the oil workers union into an empire and has been 
accused of running a parallel government in oil producing areas of the country. 
He turned oil workers into an elite among organized labor, with wages up to 
eight times higher than other workers, inexpensive union stores, subsidized 
housing and even union funeral homes. In exchange, he provided the government 
with stability in a strategic industry. 
</P>
<P>
He and Salinas are longtime foes. As secretary of budget and planning under the 
previous administration, Salinas issued an order to end the traditional 
practice of automatically granting 50% of oil company construction contracts to 
the union. However, the union retained its right to receive 2% of the value of 
all union contracts for "social works." Sources said the union is worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Galicia has long urged Pemex to buy its own fleet of oil tankers, so 
that he could unionize those workers, too, and increase his already immense 
power. Salinas, meanwhile, has proposed breaking the giant oil monopoly into 
several companies, which potentially would diminish the union's power. 
</P>
<P>
Before Salinas was inaugurated, members of the oil union who hold seats in the 
federal Chamber of Deputies publicly accused former Pemex chief Mario Ramon 
Beteta of having embezzled $49 million in a 1985 deal to buy two Yugoslav-built 
oil tankers. The charge was seen as a power play and challenge to Salinas. A 
month later, the PRI-controlled chamber dropped the case. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders viewed Tuesday's arrest as revenge. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the union who declined to be identified said Hernandez 
Galicia had told oil workers at a meeting in Tampico on Sunday that he had new 
evidence against Beteta. The source said the arrest was a preemptive strike.

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASKS $47.8 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
NOT ADEQUATE, HE SAYS, CITING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian sent the Legislature a $47.8-billion budget proposal for 
the next fiscal year Tuesday, acknowledging that it does not "adequately" meet 
state needs although it represents a 5.9% spending increase. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's assessment reflected his unhappiness with increasing budget 
restrictions, including the effects of Proposition 98, the school funding 
initiative voters passed last November. That measure sets minimum spending 
levels for education. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor made the most of another budget initiative, however, 
recommending that $925 million in new tobacco tax revenues, to be generated 
during the next 18 months by Proposition 99, be divided among a multitude of 
state programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Planning Out 
</P>
<P>
Although the budget contains hefty hikes in state support of public schools and 
prisons, it slashes other programs and eliminates the state office of family 
planning, a $36-million-a-year project that provides birth control and abortion 
counseling. The budget also contains no money to meet legal requirements that 
it provide cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients and for aged, blind 
and disabled people receiving aid. These increases can be withheld only with 
the consent of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian complained that the cuts are necessary because not enough money is 
left to go around after schools get the funds coming to them under Proposition 
98. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that our economy is booming and the budget is the largest 
ever, the spending plan I am proposing today does not adequately meet all the 
needs of our people -- not because the spending is too low, but because the 
restrictions placed on us in the budget process are too many," Deukmejian said 
during a breakfast speech to members of Sacramento's Comstock Club on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian announced earlier that he will ask the Legislature to consider 
revising restrictive budget policies, such as numerous "entitlements," or 
guaranteed annual program increases tied to the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the provisions of Proposition 98, which requires that kindergarten 
through high school and community college programs receive roughly 40% of the 
state's $38-billion general fund, the budget provides schools with $15.1 
billion during next fiscal year, an 8% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Of that sum, $400 million would come from Proposition 98. An additional 
$116-million Proposition 98 bonus, according to the Deukmejian Administration, 
will be provided for public schools during the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also contains a $1.1-billion reserve -- a rainy-day fund that 
Deukmejian insists is necessary as a matter of "common sense." 
</P>
<P>
The state is expected to end the current fiscal year June 30 with $3 million in 
the reserve fund that stood at $1.1 billion two years ago. As a result, 
rebuilding the reserve will take $1.1 billion of the $2.8 billion in new sales, 
income and other tax receipts the state expects to receive in the 1989-90 
fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$66.2-Billion Total 
</P>
<P>
Counting federal funds that will be available to the state, spending under 
Deukmejian's plan actually would total $66.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature will conduct months of hearings on the budget before it returns 
the spending plan to Deukmejian in June. The Legislature is required by the 
California Constitution to complete its work on the budget by June 15, but it 
has met that deadline only five times in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the budget recommendations, such as elimination of cost-of-living 
increases for welfare recipients, are expected to be extremely difficult for 
the Democratic-controlled Legislature to accept. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said he would not 
automatically reject Deukmejian's proposals, but he indicated that the governor 
faces a fight in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti called the governor's budget "an opening gambit, not a final offer." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate leader noted that Deukmejian opposed Proposition 98, the school 
funding measure. "(Deukmejian) really wants to make the point that you can't 
have increased educational services and maintain health services at the same 
time. We disagree," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Expectations . . . Dashed' 
</P>
<P>
"The high expectations offered by the governor in his State of the State 
address (Monday) were dashed on the rocks of budget reality. I had hoped for 
more," said John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee. He is to conduct hearings on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This budget is a disaster. Penny wise and pound foolish, it represents a 
cannibalization of California's least fortunate. . . . I will not allow this 
budget to be implemented in this fashion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff, Deukmejian's chief fiscal adviser, called 
the proposed budget the "most difficult" one he has drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 98 and 99, with their legal restrictions and requirements, 
complicated an already tight budget that was strained to the breaking point 
last year by the inflexibility of the voter-approved limit on state government 
spending and an unexpected $1-billion drop in corporate and personal income tax 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in tax revenues resulted from miscalculations of the effect of 
legislation enacted in 1987 conforming state tax codes to federal statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian tried last May to remedy the problem by proposing new tax levies 
that would have raised an additional $800 million annually. The governor 
dropped the plan when he found little support for it in the Legislature, and 
since then he has said he will not support a tax increase to raise revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Tax Increases 
</P>
<P>
Huff, during a nearly 2 1/2-hour briefing for reporters in the Capitol, said, 
"The governor has not changed his position on tax increases. We are not going 
to be proposing any tax increases." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial parts of the proposed budget is the one dealing 
with the governor's plan to spend tobacco tax revenues stemming from 
Proposition 99. It was immediately criticized by the coalition of groups that 
sponsored the initiative measure. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative raised the tax on cigarettes 25 cents a pack and required 
comparable increases in taxes on cigars and other tobacco products. It is 
estimated that the increases will raise $300 million during the remaining six 
months of this fiscal year and $625 million during the next budget year. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions of the initiative require that the money is to be used for the 
treatment and research of tobacco-related diseases, for the support of school 
and community education programs about smoking and for fire prevention and 
environmental conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and his budget writers liberally interpreted the initiative and 
proposed distributing the nearly $1 billion in a variety of programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care for Indigents 
</P>
<P>
The largest single expenditure is a proposal to earmark $258.9 million to 
finance a new California Health Care for Indigents Program. It would finance 
medical services to poor people who otherwise cannot afford medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also proposes to cut $258.7 million from the state-supported 
medically indigent services program. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the initiative complained that the substitution of programs is a 
thinly disguised effort by Deukmejian to finance a state program with tobacco 
tax revenues. Huff denied this, although he conceded that the same recipients 
receiving care under the medically indigent program to be eliminated could 
receive aid under the new program to be created with tobacco tax money. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian put teeth behind his proposals to cut various health and welfare 
programs by threatening a series of vetoes of programs popular with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are a possible $200-million reduction in aid to county mental health 
programs, a $25-million cut in child welfare services, $16 million in 
reductions in alcohol and drug treatment programs and numerous other possible 
vetoes in nutrition, senior citizen, prenatal and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cuts Sought 
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid those vetoes, Deukmejian said, he wants legislation passed 
allowing him to cut $337 million from the health and welfare programs protected 
by law. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, during his breakfast speech, placed blame for the budget problem 
on Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wish to have to make any of these reductions. But if the Legislature 
does not support such actions, I fear that the alternative will be much worse," 
Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, one of the sponsors of 
Proposition 98, said, "This is not a huge, inordinate raid on the treasury by 
the schools." Honig also said it is unfair for Deukmejian to blame the schools 
for health and welfare program cuts. "If we start pitting health people and 
county people against schools, we all lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Deukmejian's budget, the Department of Corrections would get a 12.8% 
increase, the largest percentage boost of any major department. The spending 
proposal would boost the corrections budget by $211 million to $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Huff said the increase is necessary to keep up with the exploding inmate 
population in state prisons. There are 75,000 inmates in state prisons. By June 
30, 1990, there are expected to be 86,000. 
</P>
<P>
The state's highway funding program remains a big problem for Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highway Deficit 
</P>
<P>
Funded by revenues from the gasoline tax and other highway user fees, the 
program is operating with a huge deficit because revenues have not kept pace 
with inflation and demands for highway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The governor had been counting on voter approval of a $1-billion transportation 
bond measure he backed in the June, 1988, primary election. When voters 
rejected the measure, it left the highway funding program with a $666-million 
shortfall for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget contains $3.9 billion for transportation projects, about 1% more 
than it receives now. The Administration had to delay $360 million in proposed 
highway construction and improvement projects for a year and juggle various 
accounts to come up with the money to finance next year's projects. 
</P>
<P>
"As we see it, we will have enough to sustain our program through 1990," Huff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also contains money for hiring 150 new California Highway Patrol 
officers.

BUSH ENDORSES LETTING PARENTS CHOOSE SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS THERE IS 'NATIONAL IMPERATIVE' TO EXPAND SELECTION PROGRAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Bush, endorsing an increasingly popular new idea in American 
education, said Tuesday that it is "a national imperative" to expand so-called 
"choice" programs that allow parents to select the public schools their 
children will attend. 
</P>
<P>
A similar endorsement came from President Reagan earlier in the day. He told 
the same group, the government-sponsored White House Workshop on Choice in 
Education: "Choice works, and it works with a vengeance." But those attending 
were obviously far more excited by the promise of the incoming chief executive, 
who has pledged to be "the education President." 
</P>
<P>
Bush described choice of public schools as "perhaps the most single promising" 
new idea in American education and said that choice programs "give parents back 
their voices and their proper determining roles in the makeup of children's 
education, and they give schools a chance to distinguish themselves from one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorsement Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
The President-elect's pronouncements on choice represented his first formal 
statement on education since the election campaign. The federal government has 
no direct role in determining whether a school district offers such options to 
parents and his endorsement of the idea was an inexpensive way of following up 
on his campaign pledge. Advocates of choice programs welcomed the endorsement 
because they believe that it will encourage more school districts to try the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to outline his full education program at a meeting with 
teachers Jan. 18, two days before his inauguration. He is under great pressure 
to increase federal spending on education substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his remarks Tuesday, did not hint about what he plans to propose next 
week. Describing the federal role in education as "broader . . . than might 
immediately be apparent," Bush promised that "I intend to provide every 
feasible assistance." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We're in tough budgetary times." 
</P>
<P>
In his discussion of choice, Bush said that under traditional systems in which 
school authorities make attendance decisions, parents cannot shift their 
children away from ineffective schools. "It's a system that can perpetuate 
mediocrity," he said. "Poor schools have no incentive to improve. Their 
students are captive clients." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad Schools Get Better' 
</P>
<P>
"Almost without exception, wherever choice has been attempted -- Minnesota, 
East Harlem, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and in a hundred other places in 
between -- choice has worked," Bush went on. " . . . Bad schools get better; 
good ones get better still. . . . Any school reform that can boast such success 
deserves our attention, our emphasis, our effort." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of those invited to the conference by the White House and the 
Department of Education are ardent supporters of choice, there were notes of 
caution. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos warned that many still oppose 
the concept. "We must try to reconcile them with the majority or we will never 
have peace in the American educational system," Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the opposition appears to come from school administrators who fear 
chaos in choice programs and from politicians and minorities who believe that 
it is a step toward voucher or tuition grant programs for private and parochial 
school children. 
</P>
<P>
Other words of caution came from educators who insisted that choice programs 
are of little value if the schools are not of high quality. Seymour Fliegel, a 
New York City official given much of the credit for the successful East Harlem 
program, said: "If you have a child who travels a half-hour to go from one 
lousy school to another lousy school, it doesn't make sense."

CALIFORNIANS HOPE TO SWAY BUSH ON CUTS IN FEDERAL BUDGET 
</P>

California congressmen and lobbyists on Tuesday asked President-elect Bush to 
modify President Reagan's final budget, which they protested would slash 
federal funds for numerous programs in the state, ranging from mass transit to 
reparations for Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"California would lose critical monies, as would all other states," Rep. Don 
Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the state's Democratic congressional 
delegation, said in releasing a lengthy analysis of the budget's impact on 
California programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under Reagan's proposals, Los Angeles' fledgling Metrorail project would suffer 
a possibly fatal $100-million cut in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 
receiving only about $45 million to continue construction. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Blythe, Merced and Crescent City probably would lose all 
airline service under a plan to eliminate federal subsidies for flights to 
small towns. And San Diego would take a particularly big hit if, as proposed, 
California loses all $4.5 million in federal "impact aid" for cities that have 
large military populations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Reagan proposal would make some of the 60,000 aging 
Japanese-Americans, most of them Californians, wait as much as 60 years to 
receive full reparations because of their internment in camps during World War 
II. A law passed last year called for completing the $20,000 payments within 10 
years, sponsors noted in denouncing the Reagan plan as "woefully inadequate," 
but at the rate proposed in the Administration budget it would take six times 
as long to complete the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Reagan budget was bad news for the state, however. For example, 
the University of California said that it would benefit from large proposed 
increases for AIDS research and for Pell grants to low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing a string of proposed cuts, newly installed House Budget Committee 
Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) declared that Reagan's spending plan 
"continues to unravel the social safety net. . . . It is my hope that Mr. Bush 
will come to Congress soon with specific proposals to reduce the deficit in a 
fair, realistic way while addressing the critical priorities, such as child 
care, Head Start and the environment, which he mentioned in his campaign." 
</P>
<P>
While Bush may make some modifications, he is expected to follow Reagan's 
general outlines when he presents his own budget proposals in coming weeks. 
However, lobbyists for various California interests expressed hope that Bush 
would show flexibility if the Democratic-run Congress moves, as it has in the 
past, to reject many of Reagan's proposed trims. 
</P>
<P>
"We are anxiously awaiting the release of President-elect Bush's spending 
priorities in the hope that he will live up to his promise to become 'the 
education President,' " said Jenifer Hartog, a Washington lobbyist for the 
California Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
While the state's Democratic congressmen blasted the Reagan blueprint, 
Republicans generally held their fire. 
</P>
<P>
Sidestepping comment on how the plan would affect California, House Budget 
Committee member William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) said that "the Democrats 
were never going to say they liked Ronald Reagan's last budget. What they'd 
like to see is a Bush budget they can use as an opportunity to promote their 
idea for a tax increase, which I oppose. The fact is the responsibility for 
putting together the federal budget is now the Democrats'." 
</P>
<P>
Identifying cuts that would hit California hard, California Democrats 
complained in a statement that the Reagan budget "eliminates or phases out the 
Coastal Zone Management program and sewage treatment grants. It decreases or 
eliminates support to low-income families for energy assistance, job-training, 
the Nutrition Education and Training Program, community service block grants 
and urban development action grants. It significantly reduces federal 
responsibility for refugees. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Transportation programs would take a number of blows. Besides cutbacks for 
Metrorail and small-town airports, money for Amtrak would be eliminated, 
particularly affecting the popular line between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Metrorail is not getting excited," said James F. Seeley, a lobbyist for the 
city of Los Angeles. "These proposals are pretty much retreads, which Congress 
has never gone for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Causing Concern 
</P>
<P>
UC lobbyist James Savage said the proposed AIDS research hike, while welcomed 
by some researchers, is causing concern that it will drain money from other 
biomedical projects. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed boost in NASA research would be a boon to the state's aerospace 
industry, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Savage said that proposed Medicaid and Medicare cuts would be "particularly 
burdensome" on five hospitals operated by UC because "we pick up the cost of 
indigent care that other hospitals don't do." 
</P>
<P>
He also contended that a proposed funding freeze for UC's agriculture extension 
programs would hurt farmers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacks Contract 
</P>
<P>
In another development affecting the state, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) 
called on Bush to reverse a recent Interior Department decision to renew a 
40-year California water contract that he said "ignores important environmental 
and fiscal considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a prominent critic of large federal irrigation subsidies to farms, 
cities and industries, attacked the contract signed with the Friant Unit of the 
Central Valley Project, which consists of 28 water districts and 
municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple renewal of the contract ignores the potential for water conservation 
and would have a negative impact" on water quality in the San Francisco Bay 
delta, he said.

'VERY DANGEROUS' IN PRESENT CONTEXT, ENVOY SAYS;

U.S. PLANS MANEUVERS OFF COAST, LIBYA CHARGES

The U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet will conduct maneuvers off the Libyan coast next 
week, less than two weeks after two U.S. fighter jets downed a pair of Libyan 
warplanes over the Mediterranean, the Libyan ambassador to the United Nations 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy notified civilian aviation authorities in Libya that the naval 
exercises will take place Jan. 16 and 17 and warned civilian air traffic to 
steer clear of the area, Libyan Ambassador Ali Treiki told U.N. Security 
Council members. 
</P>
<P>
"In the present context, it is very dangerous," Treiki commented to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Navy sources could not confirm the report Tuesday evening, but such 
notification is routine. Defense Department officials stressed that the United 
States had decided not to change any previously scheduled exercises in the wake 
of the aerial clash last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The outgoing Administration is doing its best to make clear to the Libyans 
that this is serious business," said one defense official, referring to the 
Reagan Administration's allegations that Libya is building a plant to produce 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Carriers, 14 Escorts 
</P>
<P>
The dates cited by Treiki for the Navy exercises would find as many as two U.S. 
carriers and about 14 escort ships in the Mediterranean. The carrier Theodore 
Roosevelt neared the mouth of the Mediterranean on Tuesday en route to replace 
the carrier John F. Kennedy, whose aircraft were involved in last week's 
incident. The Kennedy was docked in Haifa, Israel, and was expected to head 
westward out of the Mediterranean soon. 
</P>
<P>
Treiki told Security Council members that the maneuvers would be held inside 
Libyan territorial waters east of the Libyan port of Benghazi, which forms the 
eastern end of Libya's so-called "line of death." 
</P>
<P>
Col. Moammar Kadafi, Libya's leader, claims the waters of the Gulf of Sidra as 
Libya's territorial waters and has warned that navigation through the gulf 
would be regarded as a hostile act. But his claim is not recognized by the 
United States, and in August, 1981, U.S. fighters shot down two Libyan SU-22s 
that had challenged their presence over the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Treiki's comments came as the U.N. Security Council continued debate on a 
resolution condemning the United States for shooting down the Libyan jets last 
week. A draft calls on the United States to suspend its military maneuvers off 
the Libyan coast. The resolution, which the United States has declared it will 
veto, is expected to come to a vote today.

ISRAEL FLOATING MIDEAST PEACE IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Israel has begun to float proposals on the form and substance of eventual 
Middle East peace talks in the hope of countering efforts by the Palestine 
Liberation Organization to begin negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the office of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and in the Foreign 
Ministry say the proposed initiatives center on the 1978 Camp David accords 
between Egypt and Israel, which provided for a period of "autonomy" for 
Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
They say that presentation of a plan will eventually coincide with a publicity 
campaign to win the support of the American public and, specifically, 
influential Jewish groups in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once an Immovable Object 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers have noted that the outlines of the ideas being floated 
are little different from proposals as much as a decade old. They point out, 
however, that because the plans are being weighed by Shamir, who has long been 
considered an immovable object on peace talks, they reflect an effort by the 
government to give a fresh face to Israeli policy. 
</P>
<P>
"What is new is that these ideas come from Shamir," said Yaron Ezrahi, a 
political theorist at Hebrew University. "It seems that at last he recognizes 
that the situation is changing, so Israel must change to keep its head above 
water." 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said: "Shamir has some plans in mind. This is 
clearly movement. But he hasn't reached any final decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir told government radio Tuesday that he had not yet worked out a "formal" 
peace plan. Avi Pazner, his spokesman, would say only that the government is 
"studying now certain ideas based on our principles." 
</P>
<P>
The two comments were part of a denial of a report here in the Nation newspaper 
that said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens gave U.S. Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz a draft peace plan at a meeting on chemical warfare this week in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The report and the denials notwithstanding, a mosaic of proposals has appeared 
here this week, both in conversations with government officials and in 
published articles. Generally, the ideas center on two main issues: to whom 
Israel would talk and what would be talked about. 
</P>
<P>
First, the government remains opposed to talking with the PLO, which it views 
as a terrorist organization committed to destroying Israel. However, Shamir is 
toying with the idea of permitting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip aimed at letting Palestinians choose their own delegates to peace talks. 
Previously, Shamir opposed such elections on the grounds that the PLO would 
intimidate voters into voting for its candidates. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding PLO victory in any such vote, the government views an election 
as the lesser of two evils, the alternative being direct PLO representatives 
chosen outside the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only a Symbolic Role 
</P>
<P>
Talks with the elected Palestinian delegates, plus officials from Egypt and 
Jordan, could be held under the auspices of the United States and Soviet Union 
or of the United Nations. But according to a report on Israel Radio, quoting 
Shamir, the United Nations would play only a symbolic role and not "intervene" 
in any way. 
</P>
<P>
From Israel's point of view, the goal of such talks would be to grant limited 
autonomy, rather than statehood, to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. Autonomy 
is defined as local self-rule by Palestinians until a longer-term resolution is 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, a top Shamir assistant, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said 
that under autonomy, Arabs would be able to select their own local leaders and, 
if Jordan would permit it, legislators in the Jordanian Parliament. Ben-Aharon 
called this a plan for "maximum autonomy." 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon outlined an eventual economic union of Israel and Jordan plus the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip that would permit a free flow of goods and travel 
across the borders of each "entity." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel would maintain security within the West Bank and Gaza in 
order to prohibit the "thrust of Arab power" from settling on Israel's 
doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon blamed an apparent delay in coming up with a new peace policy on the 
coalition of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and the center-left Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"New ideas have to be approved by a lot of people," he said, "and that is a 
slow process." 
</P>
<P>
The pressing interest here in producing a peace plan stems from Washington's 
decision last month to talk with the PLO. The spectacle of Israel's foremost 
ally talking with a group that sees peace coming in the form of a new 
independent Arab state on Israel's borders stunned Israeli officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against any independent state west of the Jordan River," Ben-Aharon 
said. "Talks with the PLO would inevitably turn on the creation of a 
Palestinian state." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan have both recognized the Palestinian state, as has the Soviet 
Union. The Israeli concept of autonomy for the Palestinians is rejected by the 
PLO and its international supporters as a means of creeping annexation of the 
occupied territories by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has embarked on a renewed diplomatic campaign to get its point across, 
but the way does not look easy.

SOVIETS HEDGE ON FEB. 15 AFGHAN PULLOUT DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union warned Tuesday that it might delay the withdrawal of its 
troops from Afghanistan beyond Feb. 15, the date by which it had agreed to 
complete the pullout. 
</P>
<P>
Word of this possibility came from Yuli M. Vorontsov, a first deputy Soviet 
foreign minister and the Kremlin's Afghanistan trouble-shooter, who returned to 
Moscow after touring the region. He met with officials of Pakistan and Iran and 
officials of the rebel forces fighting the Afghan government. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 in an effort to prop up a 
pro-Soviet government. As part of U.N.-mediated accords signed last year in 
Geneva, the Soviets agreed to remove the troops, estimated at 115,000, in 
stages. About 50,000 were withdrawn last year, and the withdrawal was to be 
complete by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov told a news conference Tuesday in Moscow that it is too early to set 
up a firm schedule for removing the last of the troops because of continued 
rebel attacks on Afghan government forces and the unresolved issue of a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets and the Afghan government say their troops have honored a 
cease-fire since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov, referring to the Geneva agreement, said there is "a serious danger 
that things might shape up so that the Soviet Union will be unable to do what 
the Soviet Union agreed to do as a matter of principle." 
</P>
<P>
Any delay in the withdrawal would be extremely unpopular in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "We still expect 
them to meet the deadline." 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the same kind of statements over the last several months, going 
as far back as September and October (and) during the meeting President Reagan 
had with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev in New York," Fitzwater added. 
"They have continually raised these concerns because of the situation there. 
But we simply want to hold them to their commitment." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said, "There's certainly no reason 
that they can't be out by Feb. 15. Their withdrawal has resumed, for some days 
now. So, as a consequence, we certainly expect them to be out." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Vorontsov's complaints about U.S. aid to the guerrillas, Redman 
said U.S. policy remains that Washington will back the rebels for as long as 
Moscow supplies the Afghan army. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, news agency reports from Pakistan on Tuesday quoted Western 
diplomats as saying the Soviets appeared to be making withdrawal preparations. 
</P>
<P>
The reports said that for the past week, there have been night-time departures 
of Soviet aircraft from Kabul, the Afghan capital, that the Soviet military 
hospital has been closed and that almost all of the Soviet military advisers 
have left.

GOP TO HELP QUAYLE PAY SOME STAFF COSTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republican National Committee has made $25,000 available to Vice 
President-elect Dan Quayle to help pay staff costs not met by the government, 
including the expenses of two aides who accompanied Quayle on a family skiing 
trip in Colorado over the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and aides to Quayle said Tuesday 
that the national committee funds would be used because Quayle's legal adviser 
had decided that the government should not be billed but that the Indiana 
senator would not have incurred the expenses if he had not been elected vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
According to Quayle's aides and Fred F. Fielding, a former White House counsel 
who is overseeing legal and ethics matters for Quayle during the transition, 
the vice president-elect paid all of his own costs and those of his wife and 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
Fielding said he had decided that the cost of the trip for the aides should not 
be paid by transition funds provided by the government, "if we could find other 
sources." 
</P>
<P>
The use of Republican Party funds for a vice president-elect would apparently 
violate no ethics rules or laws. And several Democrats who had served in past 
transitions said that they saw nothing improper in the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will not be sworn in as vice president until Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Fahrenkopf said that the fund is similar to assistance the party provides "on a 
regular basis to the President and the vice president." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the national committee routinely sets aside $1 million a year "so 
the public doesn't end up paying for" such things as White House polls, postage 
on President Reagan's Christmas cards and the presidential cuff links that he 
often gives to supporters -- items which might be construed as having a 
political rather than an official purpose. 
</P>
<P>
That fund would not cover the additional expenses that Quayle is incurring as 
vice president-elect, Fahrenkopf said. Thus, he said, the Quayle staff sought 
the additional money in mid-December from the party, to cover Quayle's costs -- 
other than those met by government transition funds -- up to the inauguration, 
to be held a week from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Quayle's staff, the money will be used to pay for the air fare, a 
hotel room shared by the two aides and a $30-a-day meal allowance for each, as 
well as the cost of renting a copying machine and a facsimile machine, 
installing a direct telephone line in Quayle's quarters and the $1,600 rental 
of a four-wheel-drive vehicle for the staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, his wife and three children were chauffeured by Secret Service agents 
during the holiday. The family spent Dec. 22 through Jan. 1 at a condominium 
they rented in Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Fielding said that, in seeking the funding from the Republican National 
Committee, "I didn't ask for any specific amount. I asked if they could help 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The request, he said, was made to Fahrenkopf, who is about to step down as 
chairman of the committee. Fahrenkopf, at a previously scheduled budget meeting 
the next morning, gained approval for a contribution of up to $25,000, Fielding 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, "no bills have been submitted" and the party hasn't made any payments, 
Fahrenkopf said. But he said he expects the party to be billed for the staff 
cost of the Colorado trip -- an amount that he said would be "considerably less 
than $25,000." 
</P>
<P>
A Quayle staff member said that the vice president-elect and his family 
traveled on a commercial airliner.

U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has prosecuted Mafia chieftains, 
millionaire Wall Street insider traders, corrupt municipal officials and drug 
kingpins, announced Tuesday he would resign at the end of the month amid 
speculation he might run for mayor of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, 44, whose high-profile cases earned him a national reputation as a 
crime fighter, declined to disclose his future plans, but showed interest in 
continuing public service. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-haired, quick-spoken Republican with a penchant for gathering 
headlines refused to rule out a race for mayor against Democrat Edward I. Koch, 
who in all probability will seek a record fourth term at City Hall this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer that question," Giuliani responded, when pressed by reporters 
about any mayoral ambitions. "I have not shut the door on the possibility of 
running for mayor." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he was "not close" to making a decision about the 
mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Superb Prosecutor' 
</P>
<P>
Koch called the outgoing U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York "a 
superb prosecutor" and admitted Giuliani would be a "very formidable 
candidate." The mayor pointedly wished him well -- "in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
"Rudy Giuliani has been an outstanding U.S. attorney," said Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh in Washington. "He can be extremely proud of the record of his five 
and one-half years . . . , particularly in the areas of organized crime and 
official corruption." 
</P>
<P>
While serving as U.S. attorney, Giuliani gained convictions of the leaders of 
New York's five organized crime families, brought historic insider trading 
cases that resulted in guilty pleas from financier Ivan F. Boesky, investment 
banker Dennis B. Levine and the securities firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani said Tuesday he believed the Wall Street cases had caused a widespread 
re-examination of business ethics. 
</P>
<P>
He successfully prosecuted former Rep. Mario Biaggi, a one-time hero policeman, 
on bribery charges and also obtained convictions against Bronx Democratic boss 
Stanley Friedman and four co-defendants on charges they turned New York City's 
Parking Violations Bureau into a corrupt enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani successfully prosecuted top members of one of the world's biggest 
heroin rings in the Pizza Connection case. 
</P>
<P>
He also suffered some prominent defeats in court. Just before Christmas, a 
federal court jury found former Miss America Bess Myerson, her boyfriend Carl 
(Andy) Capasso and former state Judge Hortense W. Gabel not guilty of charges 
they conspired to reduce Capasso's alimony payments. 
</P>
<P>
At a crowded news conference in the lobby of the U.S. Attorney's offices near 
the federal courthouse in Manhattan's Foley Square, Giuliani appeared to show 
little interest in being considered for a Cabinet-level post as coordinator of 
the Bush Administration's fight against illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been approached," he said. "I have made it clear I don't want to go 
to Washington. It is a job I am not pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it appears Giuliani's most likely path may be to join the New 
York office of a highly prestigious law firm while pondering his political 
options, which not only could include seeking New York's City Hall, but the 
governor's mansion in Albany -- if Gov. Mario M. Cuomo decides to concentrate 
on presidential politics and not run for a third term in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
While practicing law, Giuliani could quietly determine his potential 
fund-raising and organizational base for both the mayoral or gubernatorial 
races -- campaigns whose possible central theme he put forth at his farewell 
news conference when he charged that New York would be "hiding its head in the 
sand" if it did not realize it was in the "bottom tier of states" in dealing 
with a range of problems, including bribery, corruption and the influence of 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani showed interest in running for the U.S. Senate against Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan last year but took his name out of consideration after 
polls showed Moynihan's popularity high in New York state. With only token 
Republican opposition, the former U.N. ambassador was easily elected in 
November to a second term in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Lurie, executive director of the New York State Republican Committee, 
announced Tuesday that Giuliani and state GOP Chairman Anthony Colavita would 
meet soon to "discuss Giuliani's interests." 
</P>
<P>
The model of a prosecutor's office serving as the springboard for politics is 
hardly new in New York state. Thomas E. Dewey, New York's former governor and 
the one-time Republican presidential nominee, was a headline-hunting Manhattan 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan has been an extremely 
productive and at times fiercely independent part of the nation's criminal 
justice system. That independence was demonstrated by Giuliani, who launched an 
investigation resulting in the indictment of E. Robert Wallach, a close 
confidant of then Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III and Meese's former financial 
adviser, W. Franklyn Chinn, for allegedly defrauding Wedtech, a Bronx defense 
contractor that went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"Wedtech was the most difficult and sensitive case I ever handled in the U.S. 
Attorney's office," Giuliani said Tuesday. " . . . It wasn't a very easy 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani will leave office with his close friend and chief spokesman, Dennison 
Young Jr., the deputy U.S. attorney in the Southern District. Giuliani 
indicated they hoped to continue their close relationship over the years, 
perhaps practicing law together, or engaging in public service. 
</P>
<P>
Until a new U.S. attorney is appointed, Benito Romano, who was a key Giuliani 
aide, will return from private law practice to act as interim head of the 
office, at the request of Atty. Gen. Thornburgh.

PROSECUTOR STRESSES PRESSER AIDES' ROLE IN TRIAL'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS

Wrapping up a 2 1/2-month labor racketeering trial, a federal prosecutor argued 
Tuesday that Teamsters union President Jackie Presser and two associates 
embezzled $700,000 to pay "friends or cronies" who did no union work. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments to jurors in U.S. District Court, prosecutor Stephen 
Jigger stressed the role of Presser's associates in the alleged embezzlement 
scheme. Presser died last July, more than two years after his indictment in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Friedman, a Teamsters international vice president and Ohio's most 
powerful Teamster, and Anthony Hughes, Teamsters Local 507 recording secretary, 
have been on trial since Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Dedicated Leader 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Friedman argued that his client is a dedicated labor leader who 
would not participate in such a scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The trial included testimony from 80 witnesses, many of whom were asked 
detailed questions about day-to-day Teamsters operations. 
</P>
<P>
Pretrial documents included revelations about Presser's role as an FBI 
informant, saying he provided the bureau with information about the union and 
alleged links to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
Presser was the fourth of the last five Teamsters international presidents to 
be indicted; he had inherited the job from Roy Williams when Williams was sent 
to prison for conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
But Presser's declining health caused repeated postponements of the trial, and 
his death from brain cancer left only Friedman and Hughes as co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Racketeering Counts 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, 66, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two of 
embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the Labor Department. He is 
president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters, leader of Teamsters Joint 
Council 41 in northeast Ohio and president of both Teamsters Local 507 and 
Bakery Workers Local 19 in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 52, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one of 
embezzlement. The government contends Hughes was a "ghost employee" at Bakery 
Workers Local 19, which is affiliated with Teamsters Local 507 and shares an 
office with it. 
</P>
<P>
The case will go to the jury after closing arguments are completed and U.S. 
District Judge George W. White issues instructions on the law.

<P>
Blue Shield of California has announced a $2-a-month cut in its rates for 
so-called "Medigap" coverage carried by 60,000 elderly California customers to 
help them defray medical expenses not covered by Medicare. This amounts to a 2% 
to 4% decrease in premiums, depending on the coverage, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"In line with recent expansion of Medicare benefits effective Jan. 1, Blue 
Shield will roll back rates by $2 per month on its series of 'Coronet' Medicare 
supplement health plans," the announcement said.

</P>
<P>
Three of the four spokesmen who will be on the payroll after the cuts take 
effect Feb. 10 will be political appointees. "It was like a bomb went off,"

NCAA CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATOR SAYS PLAYOFF REFORM IS DISCRIMINATORY

Plans to reform the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball tournament 
will discriminate against historically black colleges, a delegate said Tuesday 
at the NCAA Convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that they are fiscally, ethnically and morally discriminatory," 
Chancellor Edward D. Fort of North Carolina A&amp;T said of guidelines 
established last month by the NCAA Executive Committee that give greater 
autonomy to the basketball committee to withhold automatic entrance into the 
NCAA tournament from champions of so-called lesser conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Fort fears that champions of the predominantly black Mid-Eastern Athletic and 
Southwestern Athletic conferences might be excluded from the tournament. North 
Carolina A&amp;T is a member of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. The Ivy 
League is another conference expected to be affected by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1991, the NCAA tournament will be limited to 30 automatic 
qualifiers, although Division I will include 32 conferences. 
</P>
<P>
When a resolution to overturn the Executive Committee's ruling was defeated 
Tuesday, Fort warned that the issue was not dead. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a loud and long and awesome hue that was picked up by this nation, 
if not the world, 20 years ago," Fort said. "That was when a black athlete 
named John Carlos raised his clenched fist. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the young people of today, particularly those on black 
campuses, won't find themselves in a repeat of those kinds of demonstrations 
because they might conclude that this is the only way they can gain justice." 
</P>
<P>
Fort told convention delegates that limiting the number of automatic qualifiers 
would "do nothing more than promulgate the disequalization of athletic 
opportunity for black schools in Division I basketball play." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Jim Shaffer of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference argued that 
"automatic qualification is not a birthright or membership service provided by 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"The (tournament) is not a charitable trust fund. It is something which must be 
earned through innovative hard work and commitment to better yourself, and not 
through rhetorical excuses on why one cannot become stronger." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina A&amp;T has won 7 consecutive conference championships, but has 
lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament each season. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the Aggies to schedule games against predominantly white 
schools, Fort said, because those schools have refused to play in North 
Carolina A&amp;T's 7,500-seat arena in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's much debated Proposition 48 remained unchanged as Division I 
delegates rejected two proposals that would have altered the controversial 
freshman eligibility rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I think mostly it's just an interest in some stability," Steve Morgan, an 
associate executive director of the NCAA, said of the voting. "The legislation 
has been in place for 3 years, and I think there's a lot of interest in just 
letting it settle and seeing where adjustments need to be made over time." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 48, adopted in 1983 and implemented in the 1986-87 school year, 
established minimum academic requirements for freshman eligibility, mandating 
that those who failed to meet the standards would lose a year of eligibility 
while sitting out their freshman year without playing or practicing. 
</P>
<P>
It is controversial because many educators believe that standardized entrance 
exams, which are among the criteria for determining freshman eligibility, are 
discriminatory.

Four men and two women plus an alternate were picked after 2 days of intense

publicity. Opening statements were set to begin today at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>

The last of the six jurors chosen, William Sherman, a postal worker and former 
Air Force sergeant, told attorneys that his daughter was chapter president of 
SADD at her high school in Brandon, a Tampa suburb where the fatal accident 
occurred last Aug. 1.

Behold the assist. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pass, from one basketball player to another, leading to a field goal by 
the receiving party. 
</P>
<P>
It can be plain as a biscuit, fancy as a French pastry. 
</P>
<P>
It can be as elaborate as a yo-yo trick, simple as passing the potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
It is an act of kindness, generosity, selflessness and charity.

"It's like assisting an old lady across the street," says former assist artist

The assist is an art, an act of creating, the genesis of a deuce, a skill as 
highly prized and praised as the scoring itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest National Basketball Assn. statistics, John Stockton of the Utah 
Jazz leads with 13.4 assists a game. Magic Johnson is second with 13.3. Three 
assists separate those players. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton was the league leader last season. Magic was the league leader in 4 of 
the 5 previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with assists is that they are like base hits in baseball -- some 
are obvious, others are a matter of opinion, ruled upon by a supposedly 
impartial judge and subject to a wide range of interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
If I pass you the ball and you wheel and score the hoop, I get an assist. If I 
pass you the ball and you fake left, dribble right, weave through three 
defenders, pump fake the other two foes into the air and hit a fall-away 
jumper, do I get an assist? 
</P>
<P>
No, although it's always a question of judgment. Did the assist assist? 
</P>
<P>
To be an assist, there should be some continuity and connection between pass 
and shot, a flow. The whole sequence should be a pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just give him the ball," says Chamberlain, the only center in 
history to lead the league in assists -- 1967-68. "That's a give. You have to 
help him score." 
</P>
<P>
A fine point, but important if you're Magic Johnson or John Stockton, with 
contract clauses, pride, status, reputation wrapped up in that assist title. It 
is a prestige statistic, second only to scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the only statistic where you can get, uh, help, from a friendly 
scorekeeper, such as the one in your home arena. Other stats are more obvious. 
Nobody can pad Michael Jordan's scoring totals. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain says that he routinely got shorted on the road, assists and 
rebounds. Wilt has a quick, orderly mind, and he would keep his own totals in 
his head as he played -- points, rebounds, assists. He would also keep his 
rival's stats. At any point in the game, Wilt knew how many rebounds he had, 
how many Bill Russell had. 
</P>
<P>
"If a stat guy likes you, you were in good shape," Wilt says. "We'd go to 
Detroit, the guy there would always tell me, 'I took care of you, Wilt.' But I 
knew when I went into Boston, or Madison Square Garden (New York), I'd be 
cheated on rebounds and assists. I felt they were doing a little number on me. 
In fact, I know they were. In San Francisco, I could never out-rebound Nate 
Thurmond." 
</P>
<P>
That disparity would have balanced out at home, except that Wilt played 7 
seasons in Philadelphia, where the head stat man was, and is, the remarkable 
Harvey Pollack, statistician extraordinaire, who wouldn't give his grandmother 
a free rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to Harvey," Wilt says. "I'd say, 'Come on, Harvey, I get . . . in 
Boston and Syracuse and New York, I come home and you play it straight." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey says Wilt frequently complained of getting shorted on rebounds at home. 
Unbeknown to Pollack, Philadelphia Warriors team owner Eddie Gottlieb had a 
close friend of Wilt's sit in the stands 1 game and keep Wilt's rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
End of game, Wilt's buddy had the Big Dipper for 20 rebounds. Pollack had Wilt 
for 25. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the last time Wilt ever complained," Pollack says. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey is still playing it straight. He did extensive research on assists last 
season. At most NBA arenas, the home team gets more assists than the visitors. 
In Utah's Salt Palace, for instance, 70% of the Jazz field goals are assisted, 
whereas only 60.9% of visiting field goals are assisted. At the Forum, the 
numbers are 70% for the Lakers, 63% for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
At Harvey Pollack's Spectrum, the visiting team actually has an edge, 64% to 
63%. 
</P>
<P>
Do stat men fudge for their own guys? Harvey stops short of making that charge, 
saying simply: "If it's 3 or 4 (percentage) points difference, you might 
attribute it to the home team playing better." 
</P>
<P>
Magic is one of the few top NBA assisters who collect more assists on the road, 
partly because he plays fewer minutes at home, where the Lakers blow out many 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to give Magic more assists, but I can't," says Barry Liker, in his 
16th season as the assist counter at Laker home games. "(James) Worthy, for 
instance, makes a lot of pump fakes after he gets the ball, so you can't give 
an assist. Byron (Scott) and (Michael) Cooper usually get the ball and pop it 
right away. Assist. Kareem does a lot of stuff on his own, fakes and things, 
and you can't give an assist on that." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA player today is more likely to get an honest count. Pollack has been 
keeping stats in Philadelphia since the first year of the NBA, 1946. He agrees 
that Wilt, for one, got cheated on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure," Pollack says. "I went with our team to Boston one time and sat in 
the balcony and kept rebounds, without telling anyone. I even wrote down the 
time of each rebound. In the final stats, Wilt was given 10 less rebounds than 
I had him for. I told our writers, and Sports Illustrated wound up writing a 
big story." 
</P>
<P>
Do players still get shorted? 
</P>
<P>
"We played at New Jersey this year," Pollack says. "Maurice Cheeks had 1 
assist. I saw the box score the next day. I thought, 'He brings the ball up 
court on every play, he sets up every play. By accident he has to have more 
than 1 assist.' I took the game film home and scored it. Cheeks had 9 clear-cut 
assists and 2 or 3 others that were judgment calls. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey says the NBA has never had a clinic for score keepers, to discuss and 
define and standardize assists and rebounds and other fine points of 
stat-keeping. If you tip a ball, do you get a rebound? Yes, if it's a 
controlled tip. What constitutes control? 
</P>
<P>
"About 30 years ago they had a meeting of the stat guys in each division," 
Pollack says. "About 3 times in the last 10 years, someone from the league came 
around and gave a written test on the rules -- one to statisticians, one to 
timers, one to 24-second-clock operators. I have no idea what the test results 
were. They never told us. It's like (the qualification to be an NBA 
statistician is), 'Here's a manual, go read it and do the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is too bad, because Magic and Stockton probably will battle to the wire, 
the winner's name chiseled in stone, heralded and honored and rewarded, all on 
the basis of a scorekeeper's whim. 
</P>
<P>
Simple solution: If the stat race is close the last month of the season, enlist 
Harvey Pollack to tally up Magic's and Stockton's assists, via videotapes of 
the Utah and L.A. games. He could do it over breakfast.

NEW PRODUCT ATTRACTS ATTENTION AND TROUT, BUT IS IT SPORTING?; 
</P>
<P>
THE GREAT DE-BAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trout fishermen generally find their prey to be finicky and elusive, and 
therefore pay special attention to what may produce the best results. 
</P>
<P>
Fly fishermen might find an Olive Matuka to work better than a Mayfly Nymph on 
a particular day. Conventional fishermen, on the other hand, might use cheese 
one day and salmon eggs the next. Should either of these fail, a marshmallow 
may do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are such factors as weather, the time of day, the temperature and 
level of the water. All come into play to further challenge one's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Should such baits prove futile, as they often do, or should knowledge of 
conditions do little to fill your stringer, never fear. These variables, in the 
minds of some anyway, have become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Years of testing by chemists and biologists "to figure out just what it is that 
trout like" has resulted in Power Bait, and it's taking California and its 
trout population by storm. 
</P>
<P>
"We never dreamed it would take off like this," said Mike Fine, publicist for 
Berkley, a company in Spirit Lake, Iowa, that manufactures fishing tackle and 
supplies. "It has been phenomenal, the hottest product in (California). And the 
bottom line is, it really works." 
</P>
<P>
From the Eastern Sierra to the city-operated park lakes in and around Los 
Angeles, those using this sticky substance -- either pink or yellow, and soon 
to be available in marshmallow white and fluorescent orange -- have found trout 
to be quite willing to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost automatic," said Larry Hartnett, a longtime fisherman from Covina. 
"If you have it, you're going to catch trout. It doesn't matter if you're a 
weekend fishermen or an experienced fisherman. If you want to catch fish, 
that's what you use." 
</P>
<P>
The concession manager at Pyramid Lake in Los Angeles County agreed, saying, 
"The trout just give themselves up." 
</P>
<P>
At Arizona's Willow Beach, formerly one of the country's great trout fisheries 
and still a favorite fishing hole, the bait is as sought after as the fish 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We go through cases of it," said Lisa Stufkosky from the resort 14 miles below 
Hoover Dam. "People are buying it instead of Zeke's (another popular trout 
bait), and the trout sure seem to like it." 
</P>
<P>
The weekly news release from Irvine Lake reads like an advertisement from 
Berkley: 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Abila of Ontario used Power Bait to entice this week's biggest trout to 
hit. Abila's 12-pound trout topped all other fish. . . . Jim Carley of 
Paramount fished Power Bait to haul out a 7-pound (rainbow trout), and catching 
6 1/2-pound trout were: Danny Karestic of Stanton and Chad Stoddard of Brea. 
Both anglers caught these trout on Power Bait." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Elliott, vice president in charge of operations at Irvine and Santa Ana 
River Lakes, said: "It's one of the most successful new baits I've come across 
in all my years involved in fishing. Last year we sold 800 cases of Velveeta 
cheese, this year half that." 
</P>
<P>
From one of Elliott's employees at Irvine Lake: "We ordered 900 cases when it 
came out and we're close to running out, and 90% of the pictures of big trout 
we have on our wall have been caught with Power Bait." 
</P>
<P>
Power Bait became available last June, about halfway through the Eastern Sierra 
trout season. Its success there was immediate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the back country, 4 or 5 fishermen would go catch 30 or 40 golden trout, 
which is extremely tough to do," said Jim Gieser of Ken's Sporting Goods at 
Bridgeport, Calif. "It was out-fishing all other baits 4 or 5 to 1. We had to 
go directly to Berkley to keep up (with demand). People were buying 6-7 jars at 
a time." 
</P>
<P>
Berkley officials knew from field tests that they had developed a product to 
compete with other trout bait manufacturers, but were as surprised as anyone at 
how fast it caught on. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we could compete with Zeke's but salmon eggs are about as natural a 
bait as you can get so we didn't know how we would do against them," said Dan 
Foote, director of chemical research for the product. 
</P>
<P>
"After the pre-tests (in the company laboratory), we went to the June Lake area 
for a week of fishing for trout. We out-fished salmon eggs 5 or 6 to 1. Same 
with Zeke's. We used a drop line with two hooks, with one of each type of bait 
on each. We caught 150 fish and the numbers were consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Said Berkley vice president Mike Breeny: "Our orders are exceeding plant 
capabilities. We're in a constant battle to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
Berkley's suggested retail price for a 1 3/4-ounce jar of Power Bait is $3.25. 
But California fishermen -- California is Berkley's primary market because, as 
officials said, "most other places are frozen over now" -- will be hard-pressed 
to find it for less than $4. Some can expect to pay up to $7 to enterprising 
fishermen-salesmen at local lakes, where some concessionaires' shelves are 
suspiciously empty. 
</P>
<P>
Some fishermen have voiced complaints that bait shop owners at certain 
reservoirs are either holding onto their supplies to avoid running out, or 
selling out to those who then re-sell it. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's theory: "The Department of Fish and Game stocks lakes with a certain 
(number of trout). That stock is supposed to last (until the next plant) but 
Power Bait worked so well and a few people caught all the fish. Power Bait 
upset the stocking schedule and the concessionaires don't like it because 
people who use it clean all the fish out." 
</P>
<P>
Some callers to The Times in recent weeks have said that concessionaires told 
them to "get it while you can because it's not going to be around for long." 
</P>
<P>
Other complaints say the bait supposedly contains illegal ingredients or it is 
similar to the commercial pellets used by trout hatchery personnel to feed 
fingerling trout. In that case, it could fall victim to DFG restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Foote, who guessed that Berkley has spent "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in 
research on the product, maintains that Power Bait "does have a chemical base, 
but it is made of a combination of natural and chemical ingredients (and 
contains no illegal or harmful ingredients)." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the DFG said it has no plans to restrict any bait simply because 
it works. "Our whole idea is for people to catch fish," said Curt Taucher of 
the DFG's information office. "For us, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
And for fishermen who like a sure thing, it's great, too. 
</P>
<P>
However, fishermen who like the challenge fishing presents suggest that the 
fish are getting less than an even break. Fly fishermen, who consider 
themselves the true outdoors enthusiasts when it comes to fishing, are 
appalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who has to use a bait like that shouldn't consider themselves a 
fisherman," said one Los Angeles-area fly fisher. "There ought to be a law 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hartnett: "It almost takes the sport out of fishing, not that catching 
stocked trout is all that sporting." 
</P>
<P>
Gieser maintains that it's an individual's decision, saying: "If people want to 
lessen their chances, they can fish flies or other bait and catch one or two 
fish. Then if that doesn't work, they can resort to Power Bait to take some 
home." 
</P>
<P>
When told of Hartnett's comment, Foote laughed, and said: "Well, then tell him 
to try fishing with one of his hands tied behind his back."

U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was awarded the Olof Palme prize 
Tuesday and said the cash will be used to set up a scholarship for students to 
study peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar received the $16,000 from Lisbet Palme, widow of the former 
Swedish prime minister and outspoken disarmament supporter who was slain by an 
unknown gunman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Perez de Cuellar's devoted leadership of the United Nations has 
restored world hope for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Olof Palme prize, established in his memory by his family and 
the Social Democratic Party, has been awarded each year for outstanding 
achievement in the field of international understanding and common security.

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution in the area. It has the power to seek court-imposed fines against 
polluters of from $25 to $25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that 
emissions exceed legal limits, the potential danger to the public, whether the 
violation was intentional, accidental or due to negligence and the company's 
history of violations. These are the 10 highest penalties paid in November:

ISLANDERS NEED TO MAKE CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it is easier to start from scratch than rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
When the New York Islanders began in the National Hockey League in 1972-73 as a 
ragtag collection of other teams' castoffs, fans didn't expect much from them 
-- and that's just what they received. 
</P>
<P>
But now, four Stanley Cups are a distant but unforgettable part of Islanders 
lore, making the Islanders' mid-point record of 11-27-2 even harder to take. 
After qualifying for the playoffs in every spring since 1975, the Islanders are 
in danger of being idle in April. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a painful transition, especially since the 1987-88 Islanders were 
the regular-season champions of the Patrick Division -- a deceptive 
accomplishment, as the Islanders were only seven points ahead of the last-place 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Stability has long been an Islanders hallmark, but a series of injuries and the 
Islanders' rapid descent to the division basement changed that. There have been 
35 different players in blue and orange jerseys this year, and two coaches in 
dark suits. Al Arbour returned behind the Islanders' bench, replacing Terry 
Simpson on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Arbour made a reluctant decision to try to help General Manager Bill Torrey 
turn the Islanders around. The Islanders began to show steady improvement under 
Arbour, but quickly reverted to bad habits. After winning three of four games, 
the Islanders suffered a lost weekend with erratic losses against the New York 
Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders have some decisions to make as they head into the second half. Do 
they let youngsters such as centers Rob DiMaio and Tom Fitzgerald develop in 
the minors, or keep them on hand to add a spark as they did in their NHL debuts 
Sunday? How do they encourage the newer players to develop into leaders with 
the intimidating presence of proven winners such as Brent Sutter and Bryan 
Trottier still in the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of kids, and they don't know what it takes to win," Arbour 
said. "It's like going out on your first date. It's part of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that many veterans, and some of them have taken as much as they 
can," Arbour added. "The young guys have got to find their identity. They've 
got to emerge. When something like that happens, something triggers it off and 
it all happens at once. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Gretzky going to L.A. Look at what it's done for some of those 
guys. All of a sudden they started coming into their own. Now, that left some 
of those guys in Edmonton off-balance. It's not the same (for the Oilers). The 
guys are still good hockey players, but maybe they've lost some of that 
cockiness. It's going to take something good to make it really happen." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of maturity can't be forced. It has to develop gradually, and until 
it does, the Islanders can only wait until someone acts as the catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltending: Kelly Hrudey was so spectacular early in the season that he almost 
single-handedly stole two victories for the Islanders. Simpson made Hrudey his 
No. 1 (last season, Hrudey and Bill Smith shared the load almost equally), and 
Hrudey responded at the start. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 38, is getting more playing time under Arbour than Simpson. Smith made 
eight appearances in 27 games under Simpson, five in 13 under Arbour. Hrudey is 
benefiting from the rest, Smith from more frequent work, and both goalies are 
enjoying Arbour's attention to team defense. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Pinpointed as a trouble spot because of Denis Potvin's retirement and 
the three rookies on the blue line, the defense corps, as anticipated, is a 
weakness. But it isn't the kids who have been at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Konroyd started the season carrying a heavy burden as the cornerstone of 
the defense, and it was too much for him to bear. In November, Konroyd and 
forward Bob Bassen were traded to Chicago for Gary Nylund and Marc Bergevin, 
who were billed as heavy hitters but have not lived up to their advance 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Morrow's aching 32-year-old knees were pressed into everyday service 
because of injuries -- especially to Gerald Diduck, who missed 14 games -- and 
he made a gallant effort to contribute. Tomas Jonsson, at 28, experienced such 
a sharp decline that Arbour has reduced his role to strictly special teams. 
Forced to look outside the organization for help, Torrey came up with 
32-year-old Reed Larson, signed as a free agent Dec. 5. Larson's point shot is 
the best on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Pilon, the surprise of training camp, may be the steadiest Islander of all 
on defense in his rookie season. Pilon is now paired with former U.S. Olympian 
Jeff Norton, who has the worst plus-minus on the team (-18) and has had 
difficulty adjusting to the quicker-paced transition game of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders never got a chance to see Dean Chynoweth develop. The No. 1 draft 
pick of 1987 has had a lost season, inactive since he was gouged in the left 
eye by Rick Tocchet on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards: The front line has been full of surprises. Some have been pleasant, 
as in the case of rookie David Volek. Others, in the cases of Mikko Makela and 
Alan Kerr and Trottier, have not. 
</P>
<P>
Volek defected from Czechoslovakia in the summer and has made the difficult 
adjustment to living in the United States and playing in the NHL. His 14 goals 
are second only to Pat LaFontaine's 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with the way Volek has been playing," Arbour said. "Game in, 
game out, he's been one of our most consistent players." 
</P>
<P>
But Makela, a 36-goal scorer last season, has only eight at the midway point. 
Kerr, who missed seven games with a knee injury, has only five goals after a 
24-goal season. Trottier is no longer the dominant player he was during the 
team's glory years. 
</P>
<P>
After a poor start, Brent Sutter is warming up for a strong second half. Sutter 
had only one goal in his first 16 games, then netted 11 in the next 24. With 
Sutter centering for Volek and Patrick Flatley (recently sidelined again after 
a successful return from extensive knee surgery), the Islanders had the makings 
of a line that could provide the game-breaking goals. If Flatley is out for an 
extended time, that chemistry will again be lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: A playoff berth is still a mathematical possibility, but that's about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always hope," Arbour said. "You never give up. You see a lot of 
strange things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the Islanders in the playoffs this year wouldn't be strange. It would be 
just short of miraculous.

IOWA IS WINNING WITH SOME LONG SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY COTTON, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the practice -- two hours of fast-break and shooting drills, defensive 
fundamentals and situation play, scrappy tow-headed point guards and 
seven-footers diving on the floor after loose balls -- the Iowa basketball team 
prepared to leave the Smith Center at the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
One thing remained undone, a ritual that has become a part of each of the 
team's road games. Hovering around the sidelines, players and coaches watched 
as diminutive assistant coach Gary Close attempted a hook shot from half court. 
As he has on every other occasion this season, Close sank it within three 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
"Great," marveled head coach Tom Davis amid the cheers and hand slapping, "now 
we've got a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
Chances are the Hawkeyes' No. 5 ranking and 13-1 record after last Saturday's 
98-97 victory over the Tar Heels have more to do with the Iowa's work ethic 
than trick shots by assistant coaches, but who knows? Besides, the almost-hokey 
touch seems perfectly proper on a team that is achieving far more than it 
probably has any right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
The gifted senior trio of Roy Marble, Ed Horton and B.J. Armstrong can compete 
with anyone in the country and comprises the main reason the Hawkeyes were in 
the top 10 of most pre-season polls. But Iowa lost seven players from last 
year's 24-10 team, and a month ago Matt Bullard and Michael Ingram, juniors who 
were expected to complement the senior trio, were lost to knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
All that remained was one other upperclassman, Les Jepsen, a 7-foot junior who 
never had scored more than six points or collected eight rebounds in a game, 
two redshirt freshmen and five first-year players. Even so, Iowa has thrived, 
slipping only against Cal-Riverside on Christmas in the Chaminade Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to teach, but this is a little too much; we've got the three very good 
seniors, then no one who has played," said Davis, who has a doctorate from 
Maryland. "Last year I could say one word and the team could adjust. Now, I 
have to stop and explain myself and walk through a lot of the stuff we want to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is new for them: life on the road, how to eat, what equipment to 
bring. We're not as good as we were a month ago, but you can't worry about it 
too much or else the young guys start to think that they can't win." 
</P>
<P>
One of the freshmen, Ray Thompson, is averaging 12 points a game and scored 19 
in the win over North Carolina. Another, Wade Lookingbill, was supposed to be 
redshirted this season but was forced to play because of the injuries to 
Bullard and Ingram. He averages five points a game and is willing to stick his 
elbows into anyone's sides. 
</P>
<P>
That's easy to do with the burly Horton there to back him up, but it's also 
typical of the way Iowa plays. Compared to such laser-quick squads as Illinois 
and Michigan, the Hawkeyes may be overmatched in talent but make up for it in 
diligence. Each practice drill is preceded by a huddle in which the coaches 
specify what they want to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
After Davis and his assistants are through, the young players stick around for 
some pointers from the upperclassmen. The process continues off the court, 
where each senior changes roommates for each away game. 
</P>
<P>
"Really we're just being ourselves and I guess it rubs off," Marble, a flashy 
6-6 guard and the school's second all-time leading scorer, said of the seniors. 
"We get there early, stay late and the young guys just hang with us. They don't 
even know they're doing extra work, they're just doing whatever it is we do." 
</P>
<P>
The expectations that the trio plays under makes Davis' job of developing the 
younger players even more impressive. It seems like the three seniors are never 
off the floor, but none of them averages 30 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has become adroit at spotting them, using two while one sits during the 
early portions of games. Against North Carolina, the Hawkeyes made 28 
substitutions in the first half, 19 involving Horton, Marble or Armstrong. 
After intermission, however, there were only 18 substitutions; the three 
seniors were never seated for more than a minute at a time and on the floor 
together for the last six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa trailed, 80-79, with 8:43 remaining last Saturday, but rallied with the 
seniors scoring all but four of the last 18 points. The winning point came on a 
free throw by Marble, who smartly stepped to the line although it was actually 
Horton (who had missed two foul shots in the final minute) who was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that this is our last chance, if we're gonna do something we have 
to do it now," said Marble. "That hit me at the end of my junior year; I've 
never worked as hard in my life as I did to get ready for this season. I lost 
10 or 15 pounds, I lifted weights, I worked on my shooting. Everything I was 
able to do in the past, I can do 10 times better now." 
</P>
<P>
An only child, Armstrong left Detroit for Iowa City because "I knew I could 
grow there," he said. "And even if I had problems, I wouldn't be able to run 
back home -- I'd have to stay and stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
The sense of being challenged hasn't left. That's one reason why, when Davis 
hesitated to schedule North Carolina after the start of the Big Ten season, 
Armstrong was the leader in persuading the coach to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you can play a big game, why back away?" Armstrong reasoned. "It's a 
good test, good competition, and if we have any weaknesses let 'em be exposed 
so we know what to work on." 
</P>
<P>
And the Iowa Hawkeyes would be the first to tell you that hard work -- and a 
little bit of luck -- can take you a long, long way.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAY OF THE 'CONDOR' MARKED JONES' RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall, with an arm span of nearly 7 feet, Dana Jones 
of North Hollywood High has the appropriate nickname of Condor. 
</P>
<P>
But after being grounded for 5 games because of a damaged left wing (sprained 
wrist), several people questioned the Condor's flight condition before a Valley 
Pac-8 Conference opener against Grant on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Would he be able to soar like before? 
</P>
<P>
The answer was a resounding yes as Jones swooped for 19 points, 15 rebounds, 7 
assists, 7 blocked shots and 5 steals in the Huskies' 67-57 victory over the 
Lancers, ranked fifth in The Times Valley Poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really looking forward to that game," Jones said. "I really wanted to 
come back and help the team start winning." 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably only 80%," North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller said. "But 
Dana's the type of player who makes everyone else play better. . . . He just 
seems to bring out the best in his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was particularly impressive in the second quarter when he hit all 6 of 
his field-goal attempts and helped North Hollywood extend a 12-point 
first-quarter lead to a 36-18 advantage at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing an Ace bandage to protect his wrist, the junior made 8 of 10 field-goal 
attempts and has hit 65.6% (42 of 64) of his shots this season. 
</P>
<P>
"My shot felt a little awkward when I was practicing during the week," Jones 
said. "But I think it really came back that night. . . . The wrist felt like it 
was close to 100%. It didn't give me any problems, except on free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Foul shooting is Jones' weakness. He made 3 of 7 against Grant and has hit only 
11 of 24 (45.8%) this season. However his strengths make him irreplaceable in 
the Huskies' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a completely different team without him," Miller said. "He's just such 
an integral part of our offense and defense." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics support Miller's claim. 
</P>
<P>
After Jones suffered a severe wrist sprain in a 69-67 loss to Gardena in the 
fourth game of the season, the Huskies (6-4) struggled to a 2-3 mark in the 
North Hollywood and Bell-Jeff tournaments. Without him, North Hollywood was 
outscored by an average of 66-60. 
</P>
<P>
With Jones in the lineup, the Huskies are 4-1 and have outscored opponents by 
an average of 72-59. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting averages of 19 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 3 steals and 5.6 
blocked shots a game, the Condor is again soaring high.

BRASWELL CRITICIZED FOR ROUT; 
</P>
<P>
CHATSWORTH'S SHAIR SAW A NEED FOR EARLIER RESTRAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Chatsworth High Coach Gary Shair picked up the telephone Monday, Cleveland 
was on his mind -- and not solely because Chatsworth plays at Cleveland at 4 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Shair, in fact, was not at a loss for words to describe Cleveland's colossal, 
126-29 drubbing of Canoga Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Gary, how's the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Could be better and could be worse," he said. "We could be Canoga." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy be damned, Shair said. Cleveland, which is ranked No. 2 in the state, 
held a 65-7 lead at halftime and clearly went too far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the coaches I know would never do that," Shair said. "I know I 
have no desire to do that to another coach, to another team." 
</P>
<P>
Shair said that Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell should have ordered the Cavaliers 
to back off sooner, before the game became a runaway. The wrong lessons were 
taught, Shair said, and Braswell's Cavalier attitude is unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a teacher first -- an educator -- and a coach second," Shair said. 
"Humiliating a kid like that has no place in all of this. He's teaching kids to 
rub it in, to kick 'em while they're down." 
</P>
<P>
Braswell agreed that the game was nothing to boast about -- for Cleveland or 
Canoga Park -- but defended his team's right to play full bore for 4 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked to my assistants (after lifting the press) in the third quarter and 
asked 'What do I do now?' " Braswell said. "Sure, it was embarrassing. But I 
don't teach these kids to miss shots. I honestly think this was a no-win 
situation for us." 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said he believes that the City Section is partly to blame for placing 
the 3-A Division West Valley League in the same conference with the 4-A 
Division North Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unfair to Canoga. They're outmatched. But I don't feel like I 
should have to defend the way we play basketball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell used his entire roster and said that no more than 1 starter was on the 
floor at any time in the second half. He also admitted that the criticism from 
other coaches had put him on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't even there," Braswell said in reference to his critics. "They 
don't know what happened or what I did. The subs were in, the press was off, 
but we're not going to alter our style for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park Coach Joey Nakasone said Monday that the team is relatively 
unaffected by the one-sided loss, in which Cleveland set school records for 
points in a game and quarter (40 in the third). 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have a good attitude," Nakasone said. "They realize it's just a 
game. Some kids would tend to take something like this very hard, but our 
players don't live and die with a basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches from the North Valley League said Braswell might have considered 
using options other than an outright stall to slow the rout and that they would 
never allow their teams to win so decisively. 
</P>
<P>
"You can work on certain aspects of your game that you wouldn't normally work 
on," said Kennedy Coach Yutaka Shimizu, whose team will face the Cavaliers 
twice in league play. "You don't want to stall, but you could work on your 
half-court offense or something. Anything." 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of additional Cleveland routs weigh heavily on the minds of some. 
</P>
<P>
Said Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson, whose team also will face Cleveland 
twice: "I don't think I even want to play them."

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
STRONG FINISH ENABLES BELL-JEFF TO NOTCH 14TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Powered by Nick Sanderson's 29 points and Greg Dunn's 20, Bell-Jeff High rolled 
to an 84-65 victory over St. Genevieve in a San Fernando Valley League game at 
Harvard on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the win, however, Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn was not pleased with the 
play of the Guards (14-1, 2-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
"We've yet to put together four good quarters this season," Dunn said. "I know 
it sounds funny to hear a coach complain when he's 14-1, but I'm always looking 
ahead. Sooner or later, we're going to run into a team that plays well for four 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
With guard Chris Dyer getting into early foul trouble, Bell-Jeff struggled in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Guards trailed St. Genevieve, 24-18, midway through the second quarter 
before reeling off a 12-4 streak to end the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Bell-Jeff began to pick up the defensive intensity and it 
paid off in the fourth quarter when the Guards outscored the Valiants, 33-19. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson scored 15 points in the final quarter and 21 points in the second 
half. Dyer scored 11 of his 13 points in final 2 periods. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cassidy had 21 points and 10 assists for St. Genevieve (1-1 in league 
play). 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 75, Alhambra 67 -- Trailing, 64-59, with 5 minutes to play, Burroughs 
went on a 16-3 tear to win the Foothill League game at Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Marnie Calderon's 3-point shot with 3:30 left gave the Indians a 66-65 lead 
they never relinquished. Calderon also had 8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
All-Foothill League forward Dan Murphy scored a game-high 25 points -- 10 in 
the fourth quarter -- and grabbed 14 rebounds for Burroughs (10-5, 2-0). 
Teammate Tom Clemons had 11 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs made 12 of 15 free throws in the final period and 20 of 30 in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 56, Harvard 45 -- Chris Bruckner scored 7 of his game-high 28 points 
in the fourth quarter and teammate Pete Miller scored 8 of his 12 in the fourth 
quarter as Chaminade pulled away in the San Fernando Valley league game at 
Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 41-38, at the end of the third quarter, Chaminade spread the court in 
the fourth period as Miller and Bruckner took charge, scoring all of the 
Eagles' points. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner, a 6-5 senior forward, made 11 of 14 field-goal attempts and 6 of 7 
free throws and also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Miller added 7 assists for Chaminade (6-6, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Mike Beckwith scored 24 points for Harvard but was held to 2 points in the 
second half as Chaminade's Colin Havert hounded him after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Rick Osterloh added 13 points for Harvard (0-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Agoura 56, Calabasas 54 -- The Chargers outscored the Coyotes, 19-5, in the 
final period to come from behind in the Frontier league game at Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fuller scored 12 points for Agoura (3-8, 1-1) and Tim Friedlander had a 
game-high 23 points for Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill 72, Canyon 69 (OT) -- Shawn Klezovich scored off a turnover to send 
the game into overtime and then made 3 free throws in the extra period to hold 
off Canyon in the Golden League game. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon led by as many as 15 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 70, Burbank 64 -- Brett Wilson scored 12 of his game-high 27 points in the 
fourth quarter to lead Hart (8-7, 2-0) to the Foothill League victory. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, playing in the low post, hit 10 of 17 field-goal attempts. Michael 
Ohlman scored 9 of his 14 points by hitting 3 of 4 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank fell to 0-2 in league play and 2-12 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep 97, Marshall Fundamental 80 -- A second-quarter full-court press 
by Montclair Prep forced Marshall Fundamental into 6 turnovers, turning a 
6-point lead into a 16-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep also converted 36 of 48 free throws, many deriving from fast 
break fouls and fourth-quarter desperation fouls. 
</P>
<P>
J. T. Billingslea and James Gerber scored 25 and 26 points, respectively, for 
Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian 62, L.A. Baptist 56 -- Senior forward Mike Curl scored 11 
first-quarter points, leading Village Christian to a 10-point lead it never 
relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian, took only 6 3-point shots, opting to take advantage of L. A. 
Baptist's sagging zone by pounding the ball inside. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley 45, Providence 38 -- Senior forward Todd Steinman scored a game-high 12 
points to lead Buckley (4-4, 1-0) in a Delphic League opener at Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Community 77, Newbridge 51 -- Grace Community (7-3, 2-0) received a total 
of 52 points from starting guards Scott Lechuga and Anthony Serra in the 
Westside League game. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall 73, Oak Hill 55 -- Robert Ramirez hit 6 3-point shots and scored 
25 points for the Hawks (6-3, 2-0) in the Westside League game at Highland 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith scored 25 points for Oak Hill (5-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Lutheran 52, Antelope Valley Christian 44 -- Junior forward Stephen 
Willweber had team-highs with 16 points and 13 rebounds to lead L. A. Lutheran 
to a nonleague win at home. 
</P>
<P>
West L.A. Baptist 61, West Valley Christian 60 -- Despite 27 points from 
sophomore center Chris McWhorter, West Valley Christian lost its second 
consecutive Westside League game by 1 point.

2 TEAMS STEP UP IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The radically revised structure of the Southern Section basketball playoffs has 
crossed its first hurdle and little has changed since the start of the season: 
Few schools opted for upward mobility and confusion continues to reign. 
</P>
<P>
Among Valley-area teams, only Bell-Jeff and Crespi exercised their option last 
week to move to a higher division should either team qualify for the playoffs. 
Bell-Jeff, of the San Fernando Valley League, has moved from the 2-A to 2-AA. 
Crespi, of the Del Rey League, has moved from the 3-A to the 4-AA. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section has grouped playoff brackets this season by enrollment in 
order to align the section with the state playoff structure. Teams must either 
finish among the top 3 in their respective leagues or have a winning percentage 
of at least .500 to qualify for the playoffs. But when postseason play begins, 
league teams will head in various directions. (Please see accompanying chart.) 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section will crown 9 champions, 3 more than last season, but 
officials admit the plan to form 9 32-team brackets was misguided. After 
grouping teams that automatically qualify for the playoffs, officials planned 
to fill out brackets with teams that played at least .500 ball. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-AA, for example, includes only 32 teams, and only 12 had .500 records or 
better through Friday's games. The 2-A has only 7 teams with records of .500 or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section official Dean Crowley insisted that the 2-AA would remain 
separate from the 2-A. He admitted, however, that some brackets could shrink to 
as few as 16 or even 8 teams.

Crespi Coach Paul Muff and Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn said that they moved up 
because their schools traditionally play at higher levels. But Muff suggested 
that most teams opted for the status quo because of uncertainty surrounding the 
new system. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are still confused and figure they might as well stay where 
they're at," Muff said. "Before, you always knew who you were going to compete 
against. Now everybody is spread around. I don't know if I like the system. I 
just want to see what happens."

Despite shortcomings, Crowley sees signs that the new structure is meeting its 
goal by raising coaches' awareness of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel it's very important to win a Southern Section championship, but 
we want to give our best teams a shot at a state tournament," he said. "If the 
state dropped the championship tournament, we'd go back to our old division 
concept. But as long as the state conducts its tournaments by enrollment, we 
want to follow to get our best schools in the tournament."

STATWATCH: CLEVELAND STARTERS STEAL AWAY TO A QUICK START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a high school basketball team to average 88.8 points a game, it takes 
turnovers, it takes breaks and it takes hot shooting. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, it takes a thief. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (11-2) has players who certainly qualify. Starting guards Adonis 
Jordan and Tim Bowen are averaging more than 9 steals a game between them, 
despite splitting time with several other players in Cleveland's 
run-till-they-drop game plan. Jordan is averaging 5.6 steals and Bowen is 
averaging 3.6. Senior forward Lucious Harris, a projected off-guard in college, 
is averaging 3.4 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Bowen not only taketh away, they also giveth. Jordan is averaging a 
team-high 11.5 assists a game and Bowen is averaging 7.9. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the area's best pickpockets will meet Jan. 25, when Jordan and Bowen 
face Taft senior Dedan Thomas, who is averaging 5.5 steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: No one can say layups have padded Cleveland guard Eddie Hill's scoring 
totals. Hill is averaging 13.1 points a game off the bench, but his methods are 
rather peculiar. Hill, a transfer from Burroughs, has made 47 of 99 field-goal 
attempts (47%), yet is shooting at almost the same clip from 3-point range (14 
of 30 for 46%). . . . It is no secret that the key to stopping Newbury Park is 
stopping Wayne Cook. In the Panthers' 9 wins, Cook has averaged 27 points; in 
their 3 losses, 12.7. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed fairly innocuous when Newbury Park's Tim Lane missed the second of 2 
free throws with 5 seconds left in the third quarter of the Panthers' 64-50 
loss to Westlake on Jan. 4. That miss, however, was Lane's first after making 
21 in a row to start the season. . . . Burroughs' Marnie Calderon is 23 for 50 
(46%) from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
On a team laden with feisty guards and long-range gunners, it is forward 
Lucious Harris who leads Cleveland in 3-point field-goal percentage. Harris has 
made 7 of 10 attempts. . . . With 747 career points at El Camino Real, senior 
forward Brent Lofton needs 78 points to break the school record of 824 set by 
Sean Davis, a 1987 graduate who now plays at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Four players are averaging in double figures for Bell-Jeff: Center Nick 
Sanderson is averaging a team-high 22.3 points, Greg Dunn is averaging 15.5, 
Chris Dyer 12.7 and Ray Witt 10.5. Said Coach Joe Dunn: "Our offense is an 
equal-opportunity employer." 
</P>
<P>
Three Harvard players -- Brian Domyan (14.5 points), Rick Osterloh (13.8) and 
Mike Beckwith (13.6) -- are averaging in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Extra points: El Camino Real has lost 4 games in a row after a 3-1 start. 
Pinpointing the reason is simple -- in the 4 losses, the Conquistadores (3-5) 
have been outscored, 73-28, in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Taft is 11-1, winning its past 6 games, yet will play its first home game today 
at 4 p.m. against Canoga Park. . . . Camarillo has won 4 games in a row and 7 
of its past 8.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
JONES KEEPS COMING BACK ON LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you watch Derek Jones play basketball, minutes and halves and sometimes an 
entire game will pass without it crossing your mind that he was not supposed to 
be able to do this. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' comeback from the shotgun blast to his left side that critically wounded 
him in August of 1987 has been so successful that sometimes, for a while, you 
can forget what he has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
And on occasion, you could almost forget what he has come back against. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has played far better this season than Fullerton coaches could have 
hoped. When George McQuarn sought an additional year of NCAA eligibility for 
Jones so that he could return, he did it more for Jones' emotional benefit than 
out of hope that Jones could help the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones started the season strong, scoring in double figures in each of the 
first 7 games. Against the University of San Diego, he hit a leaning, 
one-handed shot to win the game as time ran out. Against Northeastern, he had a 
22-point, 12-rebound game. 
</P>
<P>
In recent games, he has faltered occasionally, showing signs of what may be 
fatigue and wear. 
</P>
<P>
"We always felt, with the layoff Derek's had, how much endurance could he 
really have, after all he's been through physically," Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Against New Orleans, he struggled some, finishing with 8 points while playing 
all but 5 minutes of a double-overtime game. Two games later, against New 
Mexico State, he scored only 4 points in 33 minutes, playing less because of 
foul trouble. Against Cal State Long Beach Thursday, he scored 11 points, 7 of 
which came at the free-throw line. He made only 2 of 14 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it had to do with the incident, I think it has to do with the 
time off," Jones said. "Your body's not used to the constant pounding, the wear 
and tear. I look at it to be more mental than physical right now. I'm in in a 
kind of a slump. I've faced a little adversity, and my shots are not falling. 
I'm having to cope with it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sneed: "We expected fatigue would be a factor at some point during the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
With the Titans' lack of depth, Sneed has little option of resting Jones, and 
Jones keeps playing, sometimes with less success than others, but always with 
the admirable and charming spirit that has marked his return. 
</P>
<P>
Better late than never: Gena Miller, Cal State Fullerton's 6-foot 3-inch 
sophomore center, apparently tied a school record with a 37-point performance 
in the Titans' victory over UC Irvine Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But in reviewing the box score after the game, Fullerton officials found an 
error, one that had overlooked a point. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of 37 points, Miller had scored 38. And instead of tying the record 
held by Nacny Dunkle and Robin Holmes, she had broken it. 
</P>
<P>
Miller hit 12 of 18 from the field, and 14 of 19 from the line. She also had 12 
rebounds and 4 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
That performance, along with a 17-point, 9-rebound, 7-block game against UC 
Santa Barbara last Thursday, earned Miller Big West Conference player of the 
week honors. 
</P>
<P>
Titan football players A.J. Jenkins, James Howard, Jerry Leggett and Alex 
Stewart are expected to travel to Indianapolis in February for the National 
Football League combine, where they will be timed, drilled and examined by NFL 
scouts in preparation for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, in particular, already has boosted his stock with his performance in 
the Blue-Gray all-star game on Christmas Day.

SCC COMES OUT FIRING IN SECOND HALF TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California College came back from a sluggish first half Tuesday night 
to defeat California Baptist, 96-78, in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
opener for both teams at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde game," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "We 
just didn't have the intensity the first half, but really got things together 
later." 
</P>
<P>
SCC (12-2) is ranked second in the latest National Christian Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. poll. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come out very hard. Maybe we were in awe of their jumping ability, 
but I let (the team) know I was disappointed," Reynolds said. "We needed to 
play Vanguard defense, a little more tenacious with a lot more intensity. " 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards did just that. Trailing, 37-32, they came out from what Reynolds 
called his shortest halftime speech ever to score 8 unanswered points, sparked 
by a steal and layup by junior Terry Scruggs, to take the lead, 40-37. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't say all that much to them. I just spoke for 3 minutes and told 
them what everybody here already knew, that we played poorly in the first half. 
I don't know what they said and decided individually or collectively, but they 
came out and played the style we needed to to beat quality teams, " Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist came within 3 points, 48-45, with 15 minutes to play after SCC's 
Jeff Bickmore, who finished with 21 points and 9 rebounds, traded baskets three 
times with four-time All-Conference player Michael Banks. But SCC was able to 
pull away for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Banks had a game-high 26 points, despite picking up 3 fouls guarding Bickmore 
in the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Bickmore did a great job of faking and played outstandingly on defense, but we 
didn't try to foul Banks, it just happened," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
SCC trailed, 23-13, 6 minutes into the first half, but managed to cut the lead 
to 37-32 at the half. Cal Baptist outrebounded the Vanguards, 13-10, during the 
first half, but SCC forced 12 turnovers and pulled down 18 rebounds in the 
second half.

ESTANCIA FIGURES TO TEST TOP-RANKED SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tall and talented Saddleback High School basketball team will risk its No. 1 
ranking in Orange County at 7:30 tonight when the Roadrunners travel to 
Estancia to open Sea View League play. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (14-1) is the defending league champion with its only loss coming 
against Kennedy, 59-52, in the second round of the Irvine World News 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (13-1) lost four times to Saddleback last year. Estancia's only loss 
this season was to Irvine, 55-50, in the semifinals of the South Coast 
Christmas tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is a tenacious rebounding team with good scoring balance. Center 
Malru Dottin leads the team with a 15.4-point average, followed by guard Craig 
Marshall (15.1) and Tony Agnew (9.6). 
</P>
<P>
Agnew is still recovering from an ankle sprain suffered in the Orange Holiday 
tournament and is not expected to play. Sean Simon replaced Agnew and was named 
to the all-tournament team at Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, considered one of the top defensive players in the county, also leads 
the team in rebounding with a 7.8 average, followed by Dottin at 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anybody pound the boards better than we do," Saddleback Coach 
Pat Quinn said. "We're focused on defending our league title, and there's a lot 
riding on this first game." 
</P>
<P>
Estancia relies on the shooting of guards Mike Curtis (23.9 points per game) 
and Augustin Heredia. (14-point average). 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has made 37 of 68 3-point shots, and Estancia has made 70 of 131 3-point 
shots. The Eagles are also shooting 78% at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"I've scouted Saddleback twice, and they're the best team I've seen in any 
phase of the game," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said. "My biggest concern is the 
physical matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a David vs. Goliath situation with their size. I've told our kids 
not to miss their shots, because we probably won't get many second attempts." 
</P>
<P>
The best matchup figures to be Marshall against Curtis. Marshall has limited 
Mater Dei's Dylan Rigdon to 13 points, Capistrano Valley's Scott McCorkle to 23 
points and El Toro's Greg Reynolds to 8 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Craig is so worked up about guarding Curtis, I just hope the rest of his game 
is all right," Quinn said.

$42 MILLION PROPOSED FOR COLLEGES IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes $42 
million for construction and equipment at UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton and 
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, according to the state Department of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also sets aside $10.2 million for expansion and development of Chino 
Hills State Park and $3.1 million for the Orange County Caltrans office to 
oversee planning and construction of the county's proposed toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor's $48-billion spending plan could force cuts in health and 
social services programs administered by the county at a time when county funds 
are tight. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a mixed bag," said Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
"Transportation looks good. The problem is going to be in the 
county-administered health care programs. It looks as though the counties 
really took the biggest part of the bite." 
</P>
<P>
The "bite," according to Deukmejian and his staff, will occur mainly because of 
the passage of Proposition 98, the November ballot initiative requiring that 
about 42% of the state budget go to kindergarten through 12th-grade schools and 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
So despite proposing a budget that is 5.9% larger than the current year's 
spending plan, the governor has proposed reductions of $485 million in health 
and welfare services and the elimination of state funding for family planning. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts -- which include eliminating cost-of-living increases for welfare 
recipients and the blind, aged and disabled, and reducing spending on in-home 
nursing care for low-income elderly and disabled people -- will require 
cooperation from the Legislature to be implemented. If lawmakers do not go 
along, Deukmejian said, he would make substantial cuts in local mental health 
care, services for abused children, nutrition aid for the elderly and local 
alcohol- and drug-counseling programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of, if you don't like this one, you'll like that one even less," 
said Richard Keefe, director of legislative affairs for Orange County. "It 
sounds like we would get hit even worse if he went through with the threatened 
line-item vetoes." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said he supports many of the 
governor's proposals but doubts that they will be well received by his more 
liberal legislative colleagues. And he said he didn't see how Deukmejian's 
threatened list of cuts fits in with the governor's promise to be more 
conciliatory with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lot of talk about a kinder, gentler California," Ferguson said. "But 
I also heard him say, 'I've got a gun in my pocket, and I'm going to shoot some 
holes in your favorite programs if you don't go along.' " 
</P>
<P>
The situation was not as bleak for area schools and universities. Schools 
statewide, including those in Orange County, will be getting roughly an 8% 
increase, while local colleges and universities are due to receive millions of 
dollars for construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
The budget allocates $25.4 million to Cal State Fullerton for work on an 
engineering building, a science building, a general classroom and a faculty 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine would get about $16 million for a physical science building, a 
science library, an engineering building and the first phase of a project to 
expand the campus roadway system, including construction of a new entrance on 
the south side of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana would get about $630,000 for work on two 
new classroom buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget provides $10.2 million to acquire new land for Chino Hills 
State Park and another $75,000 for the construction of initial park facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan earmarks another $10 million to improve the roadbed for 
Amtrak's San Diegan rail service, which connects Los Angeles to San Diego 
through Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
New state Department of Transportation funds would be enough to hire 47 workers 
to oversee the construction of Orange County's toll roads, which will be built 
by a special local agency and handed over to the state upon completion. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Butler, deputy director of the Orange County Caltrans office, said the 
oversight is needed to ensure that the roads are planned and built to state 
standards, because the state would be liable for any accidents caused by shoddy 
design or construction. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said the office already has seven people, including himself, working on 
the toll roads project full time. The new employees will be mostly engineers, 
he said, but will also include planners, environmental specialists and a 
support staff to back them up.

FOUNDER TO LEAVE CHRISTIAN LAW SCHOOL, ENDING DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The internationally known founder of a small Christian law school in Anaheim 
has agreed to leave the institution, the chairman of school's board of 
directors said Tuesday, ending a year of controversy that included references 
to alleged moral and ethical improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Montgomery, a lawyer, minister, evangelical Christian radio and 
television broadcaster and author of 38 theology books, has agreed to sever his 
ties with the Simon Greenleaf School of Law in Anaheim, an unaccredited, 
60-student night school that blends theology and law to train students for a 
"principled legal career." 
</P>
<P>
"The board and Dr. Montgomery have signed an agreement where he has separated 
himself from the school and is starting his new ministry," said David Berglund, 
chairman of the school's eight-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he could not comment because the agreement was reached through 
a conciliation service that does not allow public statements. Acquaintances 
said Montgomery has denied any wrongdoing at Greenleaf, and efforts to remove 
him reportedly were opposed by a group of faculty members who charged the board 
with "spiritual arrogance" and unethical behavior in "railroading" Montgomery, 
who is highly regarded both for his fund raising and recruiting and for his 
theological arguments and vision. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund, the only board member who could be reached for comment, also declined 
to elaborate on why the school and Montgomery have agreed to part company. "The 
differences of opinion we have are theological things, on a man's activities 
and what a man does," he said. "Nobody is accusing him of anything criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Former board member Walter Martin, an Orange County-based Christian broadcaster 
who said he has counseled Montgomery on his decision, said Montgomery agreed to 
enter mediation 4 weeks ago with the Anaheim-based Christian Conciliation 
Service to preserve the "school's progress. He said, 'If I had to be a casualty 
to keep the school going, I'll do it.' He went into conciliation to get a 
minimal agreement, which he did get." 
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 28 letter to Montgomery, John Wanvig, chairman of a board-appointed 
committee investigating the former dean, outlined the allegations, saying they 
included "circumstances surrounding your divorce. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The letter mentioned other allegations, details of which were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund said that in the midst of controversy, Montgomery stepped down last 
May as dean and administrator of the school and received a 2-year contract as a 
professor, but immediately took a year's sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Raised Year Ago 
</P>
<P>
Complaints against Montgomery were first raised more than a year ago by 
Christian broadcaster John Stewart, a teacher at the school until 1987 and a 
prominent figure in the Jim Bakker-Jessica Hahn scandal. Complaints originally 
were brought to the board members by Stewart and Leonard Stitz, a lawyer and 
former dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Stewart, then a teacher of biblical studies at the school, had helped 
Orange County lawyer Paul Roper draft a lawsuit intended to force televangelist 
Jim Bakker to reveal his affair with Jessica Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his role in confronting Bakker, Stewart said, those at the school 
who had complaints about Montgomery came to him with allegations of 
Montgomery's abrasive treatment of staff and his marital situation. Stewart 
said he and Stitz took those complaints to the board to "let them resolve it. 
They spent a year and a half trying to get to the bottom of things." 
</P>
<P>
Central to the complaints are a divorce that Montgomery's ex-wife, Joyce, 
claimed was completed in 1985 without her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
In a court document, she said that the couple had sought a divorce and signed a 
property settlement in 1977, but that she thought they had reconciled. Since 
then they had "lived together as man and wife, sharing the same house, having 
marital relations, filing joint income tax returns, and entertaining 
professional and business friends as a married couple," she said in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
She said she found out he had requested and obtained a final judgment when her 
son found the papers, which had been mailed to their home in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Married in Eyes of God' 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery "informed me that the divorce did not matter, because we had a valid 
common-law marriage and that 'we were still married in the eyes of God.' 
Because my husband is a minister and an attorney, I believed him. . . ," Joyce 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
She also alleged that Montgomery had physically attacked her several times -- 
once in February because she had turned a heater on. On an earlier occasion, 
she said, she had to go to a hospital emergency room because of "severe 
beatings and kicks in the back" by Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery denied the allegations of physical abuse, claiming his wife 
initiated "provoking conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
"She has refused to cook any of my meals for the past several years and for the 
past 18 months has rejected all marital intimacy," he claimed in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Montgomery declined comment on the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In April, John Montgomery's attorney asked the court for a speedy dissolution 
of his 34-year marriage to Joyce Montgomery because of a planned wedding in 
August in Strasbourg, France. Friends said they received announcements last 
summer that Montgomery had married Lanalee deKant, an Orange County harpist. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oct. 28 letter, Wanvig, chairman of the investigating committee, wrote 
that the board "has become convinced that the fundamental underlying issue in 
this matter is a spiritual matter -- which transcends all others." In November, 
the committee recommended hearings to consider dismissal. "Based on our 
biblical duty to exercise spiritual oversight in the Simon Greenleaf community, 
we will proceed with our due process hearing procedure," Wanvig wrote. A copy 
of the letter was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But a Nov. 7 letter to the board from nine faculty members in the school's 
master of arts program complained that Montgomery was being treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locks, Phones Changed 
</P>
<P>
The letter complained that the board had cut off Montgomery's salary and 
support for his radio program, "Christianity on Trial," which had been heard on 
KYMS in Orange, had canceled his telephone credit card, and had changed the 
library locks and the telephone number in his office, which Berglund said 
Montgomery also used for his private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
It also claimed that as a result of the board's actions, "the Simon Greenleaf 
staff is down to two and one-half people, there is no dean or full-time 
administrator, there is virtually no fund raising or recruitment taking place 
(and) this year's student enrollment is nearly half that of last year's, with 
next year's student enrollment in jeopardy altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also said the board's actions were jeopardizing the school's 
purpose, which the letter described as "providing bright young Christian men 
and women the essential wisdom they will need to go out into a dying world, to 
combat such enemies as academic error and intellectual deceit, to return 
intellectual credibility to our faith . . . and to bring our Lord's salvation 
to the lost." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's supporters included his pastor, Pomeroy J. Moore of Trinity 
Lutheran Church in Anaheim, who charged that the board overstepped its bounds 
by judging Montgomery on moral grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the support for Montgomery, the board proceeded, and after Montgomery 
and the board entered mediation they reached an agreement to part company, 
Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
No hearings were held because Montgomery asked for Christian conciliation, a 
process that aims to avoid lawsuits between Christians by following scriptural 
teachings, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Dean Being Sought 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, the school will return to Montgomery portions of 
his library of rare and legal books, which Berglund said had been appraised at 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a task force that is working on finding a new dean," Berglund said. 
"We have a new direction for the school and are very encouraged about the 
future of the school." 
</P>
<P>
A frequent world traveler, Montgomery owns an apartment in London and another 
in Strasbourg, France. He returned to Orange County from England on Monday but 
declined all comment in a brief telephone conversation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He does feel very hurt, that the board had made mountains out of molehills," 
said former board member Martin, the Christian broadcaster. Martin said 
Montgomery, characterized as a brilliant scholar with a history of stormy 
relationships, lost his temper many times with board members who believed his 
reaction was inconsistent with what a "Christian clergyman should be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery has made plans to start a new organization, the Institute for 
Theology and Law, with Greenleaf faculty member Michael Smythe as director. 
</P>
<P>
A form letter, sent out by Montgomery to "Christian friends" recently, 
describes the institute as a radio and television ministry that will produce 
"Christianity on Trial" -- also the name of Montgomery's biweekly television 
series broadcast on the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network -- continue 
his call-in radio program, and put on seminars in Christian apologetics (a 
branch of theology involving defense of the faith) and study programs in France 
and China. The letter also says the institute will offer unspecified academic 
programs to train "defenders of the historic Christian messages to impact our 
secular society on all levels -- to change the climate of opinion for our Lord 
and Savior." 
</P>
<P>
"Law teaching has been a great challenge, but its effects are necessarily 
limited by the fairly small number of students in such a program," the letter 
says. "The institute's boundaries are virtually unlimited! 
</P>
<P>
"A new year of wonderful opportunities in the defense of the Gospel is upon 
us," Montgomery wrote. " 'Old things are passed away: all things are become 
new.' (II Corinthians 5:17)."

MOBILE HOME RENT PROPOSAL TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has hired a private law firm to review the legality of a mobile home 
rent control proposal that still must be approved by the City Council or set 
for a special election, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rochelle Brown, with the Los Angeles law firm of Richards, Watson &amp; 
Gershon, will be paid $175 an hour for the review, although the amount of work 
to be done remains under negotiation, a city spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jack White asked for the review by an outside attorney to avoid any 
conflict of interest in reviewing the proposed ordinance. It has qualified for 
a vote of the City Council or electorate after being signed by 16,935 
registered voters in the city. The ordinance would require the city attorney to 
advise a proposed rent control board on legal questions and to defend board 
actions. The county registrar of voters certified the initiative signatures 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
White said that could require him to defend an action he earlier had advised 
the board was not enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the initiative would roll back mobile home space rental rates to 
adjusted 1984 levels and limit future increases. 
</P>
<P>
A fiscal impact report on the proposed ordinance is due before the City Council 
by Jan. 14.

<P>
9 IN VAN INJURED AS IT OVERTURNS AFTER COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine people traveling in a Toyota van were injured Tuesday when the van 
collided with a Dodge Aries at a Huntington Beach intersection, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:20 a.m. when Sandra Greeley, 48, of Huntington 
Beach was traveling eastbound on Atlanta Avenue in her Dodge Aries and collided 
with the van driven by Christine Greasley, 36, who was traveling southbound on 
Beach Boulevard, Police Lt. Bill Mamelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"Greeley's vehicle struck the right side of Greasley's vehicle," he said. "The 
van went out of control, rolled over and ejected three of the nine occupants." 
</P>
<P>
The driver and all of the passengers in the van were injured. The driver of the 
Aries was not, Mamelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The most seriously injured were identified as Joan Greasley, 61, of 
Leicestershire, England, who suffered a concussion and a fractured skull; and 
Linda Tacey, 38, of Cornwall, England, who also suffered a concussion. They 
were in serious condition at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital &amp; Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The others who suffered minor injuries, including cuts and bruises, were 
identified as Christine Greasley, 36; Phil Greasley, 38; Michelle Tacey, 6, and 
Laura Greasley, 2, all of Huntington Beach; Derrick Greasley, 31, and Albert 
Greasley, 62, of Leicestershire, England; and Richard Handley, 50, of Cornwall, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Neither driver was cited, but the accident remains under investigation.

SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
2 INNOCENT BYSTANDERS STRUCK BY STRAY BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Santa Ana men in their 20s were in stable condition Tuesday after they were 
struck by stray bullets from a shooting in which they were not involved, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana police officer was writing a traffic ticket at about 7 p.m. Monday 
at the intersection of McFadden Avenue and Raitt Street when he heard several 
gunshots. Thinking someone was possibly shooting at him, the officer requested 
assistance, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Collie Provence said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived in an alley near 700 S. Raitt St., they found Miguel 
Rosas, 24, of Santa Ana, who had been shot once in the buttocks, Provence said. 
Witnesses told police that another victim, Fredrico Briseno, 20, had been shot 
in the neck and was taken by friends to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that both victims had been hit by stray bullets fired by (people) 
in an unrelated fight that the victims were not involved in," Provence said. 
"(It also) appears that none of the gunshots had been fired at the officer, and 
the gunshots the officer heard go by him were stray rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the weapon used was a small-caliber pistol. Officers did 
not have any suspects, and the shooting was under investigation to determine if 
it was gang-related, Provence said.

RILEY SAYS CUTS HURT BIG PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kicking off his 1-year term as chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Thomas F. 
Riley said Tuesday that citizen-backed tax-and-spending restrictions have left 
county government behind schedule on such construction and repair of projects 
as the airport, roads and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned . . . as a result of Proposition 13 and the Gann initiative that we 
would have to do more with less," Riley said. When combined with cutbacks from 
the state and federal government, he added, "the unfortunate result is that 
many critical public works projects were put on hold." 
</P>
<P>
"The county's major infrastructure systems have met their breaking point, and 
Orange County residents have suffered as a result," said Riley, who was named 
chairman of the board last week, a position that rotates among the five 
supervisors at the beginning of every year. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, beginning his 15th year on the board, is the county's senior supervisor 
and is serving his fourth term as board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be a bit bruised by some of the sobering realities of the '80s," Riley 
said. "However, we have developed significant tools for dealing with the 
challenges and have cleared sizable hurdles toward gaining the information and 
expertise needed to move forward -- in a positive manner -- into the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Riley highlighted the county's accomplishments in several areas of service, 
such as the creation of new parks, managed development, traffic reduction, 
renovation of the airport and planning for new jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to 1989 as being the year that Orange County turned 100 and the 
year that we made our forefathers proud by grappling head on with problems and 
reaching timely and workable solutions," he said.

FRESHMEN AT UCI ARE A CLASS APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national study of college freshmen shows that UC Irvine first-year students 
are more ethnically diverse than their counterparts at other U.S. colleges. The 
study also found that they are less likely than other college students to drink 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials this week released results of the survey, which is made annually 
by the American Council of Education-UCLA Cooperative Institutional Research 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's UCI freshmen came from high schools and neighborhoods more 
racially diverse than their national counterparts," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, 
a UCI spokeswoman. "Thirty-four percent (of this year's UCI freshmen) said 
English was not their first language, compared with 5.6% at other universities. 
Only 47% said they came from a mostly white high school, while 62% at other 
universities did." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler said this year's freshmen survey shows how much UCI has changed 
since a 1978 analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1978, the vast majority -- 67% -- of UCI freshmen were Caucasian," 
Bentley-Adler said. "Nearly 8% were black; 15% Asian; nearly 8% Chicano/Latino 
and 1% American Indian. Ten years later, 50% are Caucasian; 2.4% black; 40% 
Asian; 5.2% Chicano/Latino, and 1% American Indian." 
</P>
<P>
The survey's questions about religion also produced results showing how diverse 
UCI has become, Bentley-Adler noted. "By far there are more Buddhists at UCI -- 
6% -- than at other universities," she said. "Ten years ago, Buddhism was not 
even listed as a choice (on the annual freshman survey)." 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 survey found that UCI freshmen are academically brighter and less 
likely to drink alcoholic beverages than their counterparts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler said that "more than 90% of the 1988 UCI freshmen class rated 
themselves in the top 10% in academic ability, compared with 77% at other 
universities." 
</P>
<P>
She said the survey also found that less than half of the 1988 UCI freshmen had 
ever drunk beer, wine or liquor, compared to nearly 70% at other campuses.

MUNICIPAL JUDGES DECIDE TO ACCEPT STATE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several months of negotiations with county administrators, the county's 
municipal judges voted Tuesday to join a new state program for financing court 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is expected to give final approval for county 
participation in the program, set up under the state's Trial Court Funding Act, 
at its meeting today. The county's Superior Court judges voted last month to 
join the program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the county is to receive about $9 million in the next 6 
months that it needs to avert a budget crisis. The courts will get an 
additional $3.5 million, including money for five new Superior Court 
judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
The county's troubled budget got another needed boost Monday when the county 
retirement board agreed to a bailout that will save the county about $8 million 
in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said it is now unlikely that layoffs or program cutbacks will 
be necessary. But a hiring freeze the supervisors adopted last month will be 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Trial Court Funding Act, which was intended to bail out financially 
strapped counties statewide, the state will assume much of the cost of 
operating the courts. But before the county could join the program, an 
agreement for disbursing the state funds had to be reached with all the 
county's judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court will get five new judges and clerical staff to serve them. 
The Municipal Court will get more than 60 new clerical positions. The judges 
will also be granted the same retirement benefits given to Superior Court 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the marshal's office was given $406,000 for new positions; the 
court clerk's office received $275,000.

SUSPECT CAUGHT BY A DOG SLIPS LEASH ON POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robbery suspect who couldn't elude a police dog managed to escape from his 
human captors Tuesday while being treated for dog bites at a hospital, Santa 
Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Moore had been captured under a house on West Cubbon Street by a police 
dog after Alfredo Torrez, 36, flagged down officers and said two men had taken 
his wallet and two gold rings, according to Maureen Thomas, a police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who was bitten several times during his capture, was taken to Western 
Medical Center at about 4:30 a.m., where he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're investigating how he got away," Thomas said. "Some of our officers were 
present, but he managed to escape at some point when being examined for his 
bite injuries." 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy arrested with Moore was also treated for dog bites and taken 
to Juvenile Hall.

NEWPORT BEACH VERSION; 
</P>
<P>
IS A GAME BY ANY OTHER NAME NOT A MONOPOLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bet you thought monopolies were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they usually are -- unless it's the monopoly on Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Brothers says it has the rights to the world's best-known board game and 
any obvious variations. And that includes Newportopoly, a takeoff on the 
original with Newport Beach business names. 
</P>
<P>
Newportopoly was a sellout hit at selected Orange County retail outlets last 
holiday season, and its local creators are gearing up to go into a second 
production run. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two partners of G&amp;L Enterprises of Laguna Beach say they 
are thinking about putting out a Los Angeles edition of the game and maybe 
additional versions based on other areas in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But Parker Brothers may have something to say about those plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly, Mass., game manufacturer owns the copyright and trademark to 
Monopoly, the classic, wheeler-dealer board game invented in 1933 by Charles 
Darrow. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Atlantic City place names, Monopoly still earns Parker Brothers 
millions of dollars annually. In 1985, sales of the game in the United States 
alone netted the company $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
And according to Manhattan lawyer Steven Weinberg, who represents Parker 
Brothers, "the Monopoly (trademark and copyright) are alive and well and 
registered and enforceable. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The very fact that people call their games 'opoly' and set up a board to look 
like the Monopoly board indicates they're trying to ride off the reputation 
that Parker Brothers has in the Monopoly symbols," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey A. Airey and Lacy Michelle Johnston -- the two young entrepreneurs who 
produced Newportopoly and founded G&amp;L Enterprises -- said they consulted an 
attorney about legalities before introducing their board game and were assured 
that it was all right. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our main concerns is that we weren't infringing on anyone else," 
Johnston said in an interview Tuesday. "We're not interested in getting into 
any problems here." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg, it turns out, wasn't even aware of the existence of Newportopoly 
until a reporter called to ask about Parker Brothers' approval of that and 
similar ventures. It seems that the manufacturer gets calls "every day" from 
people who want to use the game or its trademark, said company spokeswoman 
Patricia McGovern. While some are approved, she said, "we very aggressively 
protect the Monopoly trademark." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg said he cannot give an opinion on Newportopoly until he sees the game. 
But if Parker Brothers decides to challenge its production, it will be the 
latest in a series of hassles that G&amp;L Enterprises has had in producing the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said she "had the idea in her head" for some time before she 
approached Airey last September about actually putting it out. She said she 
later learned that the idea wasn't exactly new. 
</P>
<P>
According to Weinberg, about 20 cities across the country have put out 
personalized real-estate board games, often to raise money for local civic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said Parker Brothers objects only to those games that it considers 
"substantially similar" to Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of personalizing the game to Newport Beach seemed a natural, Johnston 
said. "That's probably the most exclusive city in Orange County," she said. 
"People here identify with Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge: Start at go, produce the game and get it into stores with just a 
few months before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with her concept only, Johnston began trotting to local businesses, 
explaining her idea and mentioning La Jollaopoly, a similar game based on La 
Jolla place names. La Jollaopoly was produced in 1987 by an unrelated company. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston concentrated on companies that would seem to want the sort of 
"long-term advertising" she was selling. For $350, she would print a business's 
name, telephone number and a small slogan on a Newportopoly space. The original 
idea was to produce 1,000 games. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the idea didn't exactly outsell hot cakes. Some businesses -- yacht 
brokers and beauty salons, for example -- just weren't interested. But others 
-- notably hotels, restaurants and an auto dealership -- were very enthusiastic 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I like promotions that are community related, and I'm always looking for new 
ideas and creative things. This sounded workable," said Jim Wood, manager of 
Merrill Lynch Realty in Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Wood invested about $4,000. He paid $550 to be on the "Risk" space -- 
Newportopoly's equivalent of the "Chance" or "Community Chest" cards. The rest 
was to purchase 300 games at a wholesale price of $12 each to use as holiday 
promotions for Merrill Lynch clients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for kids because it's got local areas. And it's just different. 
It's not something that everybody has," said Mike Martin, owner of Balboa 
Pharmacy, which plunked down $350 for an orange space on the Newportopoly 
board. 
</P>
<P>
But after the 28 board spaces were sold, Johnston and Airey found that their 
problems were just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it turned out that everybody wanted to be on blue, green, yellow 
or red spaces. "People would say, 'You're not going to put me on the cheap 
spaces, are you?' " Johnston recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were more practical problems: How do two recent UCLA graduates -- 
with backgrounds in sports medicine and economics -- come up with art? And a 
game board? Then a matching box, deed cards, instruction cards, fake money, and 
teensy red and green, plastic houses? And then, how to get it into the stores? 
</P>
<P>
But once the bugs were worked out, the game was a startling success. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the 1,000 games Johnston and Airey originally planned to produce, 
they ended up making and selling their entire stock of 2,500 games. 
</P>
<P>
The games were carried at Nordstrom, Bernans in Costa Mesa, At Ease at Fashion 
Island and the Toy Shop in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fabulous. We sold 48 of them the first day we put them on the floor," 
said Peggy Zamberlan, general manager of Bernans. The children's department 
store ended up selling at least 130 of the games in about 4 days at $23 apiece, 
said Zamberlan. 
</P>
<P>
The initial printing of 2,500 games grossed Airey and Johnston about $26,000 -- 
about half of which was profit. 
</P>
<P>
According to their lawyer, Thomas Juettner, a copyright and trademark 
specialist with San Diego's Juettner, Pyle, Lloyd &amp; Verbeck, producing 
Newportopoly should be no problem from a legal standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"Newportopoly is not a copy of Monopoly," the attorney said. "The idea for the 
game is the same, but the game is not. My clients did not copy the Monopoly 
game -- and copyright law protects expression of ideas. It doesn't protect 
ideas per se." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, to look at Newportopoly, there are some striking similarities to the 
original board game. 
</P>
<P>
G&amp;L's version, for instance, reproduces the Monopoly color combination on 
its board and the particular order of the properties. There are orange and 
yellow cards -- albeit called Risk and Newport Treasures instead of Chance and 
Community Chest. And just like Monopoly, the Newportopoly corners have squares 
marked "Go," "Free Parking," Just Visiting" with a cartoon of man behind bars, 
and "Go to Jail" with a cartoon of a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Airey and Johnston are optimistic that their game is different enough that it 
won't cause a problem. For one thing, Johnston pointed out, the word 
Newportopoly is written horizontally across the board -- not diagonally, like 
the original game. And Newportopoly has a colored cartoon on its board -- 
whereas the original game has no such drawing. 
</P>
<P>
But Parker Brothers' lawyer says those differences may not mean much in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Brothers has valid copyright and trademark protection, he said. And as 
far as Juettner's argument that Newportopoly only borrows the Monopoly idea, 
"every defendant in every case in copyright always claims they're just using 
the idea. . . . That's the classic defense." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Weinberg said, under copyright law, "the test is not how dissimilar" 
something is." Instead, "it's whether an ordinary person would believe that No. 
2 was copied from No. 1. Or are people likely to be confused into believing 
that Parker Brothers has sponsored, or is in some way connected with No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
"If the answer is yes," he said, "there's copyright infringement."

WYNN'S CHIEF DOUBTS TAKEOVER BY BUYER OF 6.1% STAKE IN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of a Michigan automotive company recently acquired a 6.1% stake in 
Fullerton-based Wynn's International, but Wynn's President James Carroll said 
Tuesday that he is not concerned about the possibility of a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that Heinz Prechter, chairman of ASC Inc. in Southgate, Mich., 
telephoned him Friday before filing the Securities and Exchange Commission 
documents that disclosed his Dec. 29 purchase of 50,000 shares of Wynn's stock 
for $20.75. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained his company and its background, and he mentioned that he had made 
an investment. We never discussed takeovers, and it's my impression that that's 
not in the cards," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Prechter nor other ASC officials could be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's makes automotive parts and engine additives and had sales of $226 
million for the first 9 months of 1988. Privately held ASC specializes in 
manufacturing and installing convertible tops for several U.S. and foreign auto 
manufacturers. Crain's Detroit Business, a Michigan business magazine, 
estimated ASC's annual sales at about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Wynn's International has quietly been gaining a following by 
some of the country's top professional investors. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gamco Investors Inc., a New York money management firm with $2.7 
billion under management, increased its stake in Wynn's to 13.7%. Gamco made 
the investment because "we feel in the next 5 to 10 years Wynn's could become a 
major participant in the auto after-market," said Mario J. Gabelli, head of 
Gamco. 
</P>
<P>
Gamco, which specializes in auto industry investments, ranked fifth among U.S. 
money managers in 1988 and first over a 5-year period, according to a recent 
survey of 420 independent money management firms by CDA Investment Technologies 
in New York. Gamco, which manages investments for several Fortune 500 
companies, saw its investments grow 38% in 1988, according to CDA. 
</P>
<P>
Shufro, Rose &amp; Ehrman, another New York money mangement firm, holds 19% of 
the company's outstanding shares, the largest single block. The estate of Carl 
E. Wynn, the company's founder, holds the second largest block, 18.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Investors and analysts agree that a management shake-up of the company in 
January, 1988, in which Carroll took charge of the company, signaled a change 
in fortunes for Wynn's. The company had grown rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, 
largely on the strength of its engine additive products. But its growth has 
stagnated for much of the 1980s, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big transition year for the company," William D. Tichy, a securities 
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco, said. "This is a very 
financially strong company that has some valuable franchises in the automotive 
and petrochemical additive business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of 1988, the company reported profits of $2.2 million on 
sales of $226 million, compared to profits of $3.1 million on sales of $230 
million for the same period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The company was hurt in 1988 by a poor performance in its automotive 
air-conditioning division, which makes up the bulk of Wynn's sales. The unit 
lost several large contracts to competing divisions of Mazda and Hyundai and 
was forced to lay off about 260 workers. 
</P>
<P>
But other divisions fared well, Tichy said. For the first 9 months of the year, 
for example, Wynn's engine additives division showed increased profits of 19% 
and improved sales of 53% over the same period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Carroll was one of two company insiders who each unsuccessfully 
attempted to take the company private in competing takeover bids. Carroll 
joined forces in 1987 with Security Pacific Corp.'s venture capital unit in a 
$27.25 bid. At the time, Carroll was head of Wynn's Precision Rubber division 
in Lebanon, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Lillicrop, whom Carroll replaced as president last January, also 
attempted to arrange financing for a leveraged buyout. But both bids fell 
victim to the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 months, Wynn's shares have ranged from a low of $15.75 to a 
high of $23.25. The stock closed on Tuesday at $23, up 12.5 cents.

GLUT OF STORE SPACE IN COUNTY PROMPTS INCENTIVES FOR TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is so much empty store space in most parts of Orange County that 
landlords have begun offering new tenants incentives such as a couple of months 
free rent, a practice common to the overbuilt office market but extremely 
unusual in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
That's the finding of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services, the 
county's largest commercial real estate brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the southern half of the county -- where a housing boom ensures lots of 
new customers for retailers -- the demand for store space is expected to slack 
off again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, construction of new stores and shopping centers -- and the 
sprucing up of old retail space -- will level off at about the same rate as 
last year, said Robert A. Peterson, a Coldwell Banker vice president in Anaheim 
who spoke at the company's year-end press briefing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have told the brokerage that they will build or renovate about 3 
million square feet of retail space this year. But Peterson says it is more 
likely to be 2 million, about the same amount that was built in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not really bad news," he said. "It's keeping the market in line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projection Too Large 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker said that last year it had been told 4 million square feet of 
retail space would be built in 1988, about twice as much as was actually 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
But tenants -- particularly big anchor stores for shopping centers, such as 
supermarkets and department stores -- didn't materialize in 1988 and 
construction of some centers was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the scarcity of anchors: The mergers last year of big 
supermarket chains like Vons with Safeway and Lucky with Alpha Beta means that 
there are fewer big companies around to supply the anchor tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason: With the rush of retailers to the booming Southern California 
market in the last few years, there are few big retailers who are not already 
here. So the prospect of landing a new one to anchor a shopping center is slim. 
</P>
<P>
And among smaller stores, certain types have saturated much of the Orange 
County market, including frozen yogurt, pizza, video rental, clothing and shoe 
stores, said the brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"In some markets there's one on every corner," said Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1988's Rents Rose 5% 
</P>
<P>
Rents rose a less-than-impressive 5% last year, averaging $19.52 a square foot 
per year last year for all but anchor tenants in the bigger shopping centers. 
This year rents will not increase much at all, the brokerage forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a different story in the south county, where much of Orange County's 
growth has moved in recent years because there is still vacant land there. 
</P>
<P>
"The south county still has a lot of demand for retail space and will grow a 
lot more briskly than central or northern Orange County," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
But even the southern part of the county is not without its problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many new homeowners there have less disposable income than longtime homeowners 
in the older northern half of the county, who bought their houses at a much 
lower price, said Scott Perley, a Coldwell Banker vice president in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETAIL SPACE IS NOT AT A PREMIUM 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of a glut of empty store space, retail rents in the county rose 
a less-than-impressive 5% last year, Coldwell Banker said. This year rents will 
not increase much at all, and new construction will level off, the brokerage 
forecasts.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: ORIGINALITY CAN BE BAD, PROFESSOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of classical music, the question of "What's new?" too frequently 
supersedes all others, even that of "What's good?" 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the feeling of Bernard Gilmore, professor of music and 
composition at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often, when students bring a piece into my office, they really disregard 
its quality," Gilmore said in a recent interview. "They're (more) concerned 
with doing what's never been done before. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it's impossible. No matter how innovative a piece is, it's beholden 
to something in the past. My feeling is that they are concerned with the wrong 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore plans to fulminate against what he calls the "obsession with 
creativity" in a talk entitled "Originality and Other Sins" at noon Thursday at 
UCI's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm neither an aesthetician nor a musicologist. I am a composer," he said. "My 
interest in the subject comes out of composing and, more particularly, having 
taught music composition for several years and realizing with how obsessed 
(students) are with originality." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilmore doesn't blame his students alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The public also tends to admire 'originality,' and I think that admiration is 
misplaced and is part of the same tendency to venerate a few masterpieces and 
'definitive' performances," he said. "It's an issue blown way out of 
proportion." 
</P>
<P>
"We've all become enamored with such terms as 'the cutting edge.' But the 
emphasis is all misplaced, particularly with respect to a young composer. . . . 
It can really stifle creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore, 51, has taught composition, music theory and conducting at UCI since 
1982; last year, he also was acting dean of the School of Fine Arts. He was 
reared in the San Fernando Valley, did undergraduate and graduate work at UCLA 
and received his doctorate in performing arts from Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore insists that preoccupation with "originality" is a comparatively recent 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, originality is a 19th-Century idea -- which we're stuck with 
today," he said. "If you read the letters of Mozart, you will never find him 
worried about being original. Mozart just ignores it. It's not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"What he talks about is skill, generally. For example, in one letter to his 
father, he brags he can imitate any style. His writings tend to be very 
practical in their orientation." 
</P>
<P>
But things changed with the "heaven-storming" composers of the Romantic 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"The 19th Century develops the conception of artist-as-hero," Gilmore said, 
and, to clarify the term, borrowed from the writings of mythology expert Joseph 
Campbell's description of the mythic hero: "The mythic hero has to journey to 
Hades or past the pillars of Medusa, slaying the dragons of the status quo, to 
achieve rebirth. From the 19th Century on, we tend to look at the artist that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Like many an academic, Gilmore proceeds by defining terms. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we probably have some common understanding when we say a work is 
'original,' " he said. "But if we start to pin (the word) down, we reveal 
paradoxes and incongruities. . . . We think we know what we're talking about, 
but we don't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The more we talk about it, the more confusing it is, arriving (finally) at the 
understanding that it is really an irrelevant notion." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore plans to play parts of three works commonly referred to as "original" 
and ask, "What it is about them that causes us to say they are original works?" 
</P>
<P>
The works include Stravinsky's "Le sacre du printemps," Debussy's "Prelude a 
l'apres-midi d'un faune," and Charles Ives' "Three Places in New England." 
</P>
<P>
"In my process of defining, the works which we call original are those which 
reveal new possibilities to us or new relationships. There is a revelatory 
quality in all those works we call 'original.' 
</P>
<P>
"For a composer to create such a piece, he has to be open to those 
possibilities of a child. For an adult, a pot is a pot; whereas to a kid, it 
can be a helmet or a drum or all sorts of things." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilmore wonders whether it is even possible to be original any more, "given 
the fact that every possible sound has been made." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to draw on excerpts from the works of minimalist composer John Adams 
("Nixon in China") to show that what is considered original and new may merely 
be ideas whose times have come. 
</P>
<P>
"The point I want to make with Adams is the irony that, just as with 
representational painting -- which we filter through our experience of decades 
of non-representational painting -- these very familiar sounds (by Adams), had 
they been written in 1940, we wouldn't have paid any attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they sound fresh. Here again, it's a paradox of 'originality.' " 
</P>
<P>
In his own teaching, Gilmore advises his students to follow Stravinsky's 
description of composing as "an act of speculative volition. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge my students to speculate, 'What would happen if I do this?' To work 
more out of their head and on paper rather than to realize on paper sounds that 
they have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the composer needs to be much more attuned to the process of 
composition rather than (to) the product. What results, results. If it's 
original, fine. If not, is it good? Is it interesting?" 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore sees his approach as "taking pressure off the students." 
</P>
<P>
'That was the original purpose of the talk," he said. "We all value innovation 
and freshness, but if there were less obsession with the masterpiece and the 
original masterpiece, we would have more of a comprehensive view of the arts 
and a more practical conception of creating the arts." 
</P>
<P>
That is not, however, a process that ends with training in a composition class 
or at a university, he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone graduates from here with a Ph.D. in composition, I hope they would 
not think they are a finished composer," he said. "You're never completely 
developed as a composer. You learn all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Haydn's quote when he was on his deathbed, 'I have just learned how 
to write for the winds, and now I must leave this world. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
As for whom historians will regard as the creators of our time, Gilmore said, 
"I prefer to avoid speculating." But he thinks things "are going in a very 
fruitful direction. 
</P>
<P>
"As Stravinsky (forced us to do) in the 'teens and '20s, we are forced to look 
at the tradition again and come to terms with it," he said. "I'm optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Gilmore will lecture on "Originality and Other Sins" at noon on 
Thursday in the Steward Room of the Bren Events Center, Bridge Street at Campus 
Drive, on the UC Irvine campus. The lecture is free. Information: (714) 
856-8748.

The heart of a 15-year-old boy -- transplanted into the girl he loved three 
years ago -- is being rejected by the girl's body, and she will have to undergo 
another transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are looking for a suitable heart for Donna Ashlock, 18, who has been 
living on the heart of Felipe Garza since Jan. 4, 1986. Doctors learned last 
month that the Garza heart has been permanently damaged by repeated attempts by 
Donna's body to reject it. Garza died of a broken blood vessel in his brain 
only a few days after he told his mother that he had had a premonition of death 
and that he wanted his heart to go to Donna, who had learned a year earlier 
that she needed a transplant.

Marilyn Quayle may break precedent for a vice president's wife by hitting the 
job market while Dan Quayle is in office, an aide said today. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, a lawyer, plans an active search a few months after the 
inauguration of President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle on 
Jan. 20, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
A paying job in law, lobbying or a related field for Mrs. Quayle, 39, could 
raise serious appearances of conflicts of interest, according to Senate aides. 
</P>
<P>
"As to both her job-hunting and her interests and causes -- whatever she 
decides to do from a public standpoint -- it will probably be this spring 
sometime," said Quayle spokesman David Beckwith. 
</P>
<P>
He said Marilyn Quayle is serious about getting a job, "but there are obvious 
constraints -- you can't be perceived as having a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Washington law jobs are lucrative, often paying into the high six figures. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, aides said the Quayles are seeking $150,000 in private donations to 
refurbish the vice presidential mansion. 
</P>
<P>
They said the Quayles wanted to give more room to their three children. 
President-elect Bush and his wife, Barbara, raised $187,000 in a similar manner 
for redoing the mansion in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Quayle, 41, heir to a publishing fortune, resigned this month from the 
Senate, where he earned $89,500 a year. He will make $115,000 as vice 
president, have a paid staff of about 90 and will get a pay boost to $175,000 
if a proposed pay increase clears Congress.

Two West German universities have been ordered to stop using the remains of 
Nazi extermination victims -- some of them decapitated -- in medical education, 
a state government official said today. 
</P>

Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed shock over the practice after Israel and the 
West German Jewish community urged him to ensure that the remains of Communists 
and mentally handicapped people murdered by the Nazis were removed. Christoph 
Keller, spokesman for the Baden-Wuerttemberg Science and Culture Ministry, said 
three tissue samples and 150 specimens from Nazi victims had been taken away 
from the prestigious universities of Heidelberg and Tuebingen.

Police have put a 24-hour guard on the New Zealand Embassy after comments by 
the New Zealand defense minister that Emperor Hirohito should have been 
executed, an embassy spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Bob Tizard said Monday that Hirohito, who died last week at 
the age of 87, "should have been shot or publicly chopped up at the end of the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister David Lange later issued a statement saying Tizard's comments 
did not reflect the views of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing extremists in Japan have been known to react violently to perceived 
insults to Hirohito, the object of veneration by many traditionalists. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile today, police said a 38-year-old cook has become the first person to 
commit hara-kiri, or ritual suicide by knife, out of devotion to Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
Tadao Tanaka was found with gashes in his stomach and heart, bowed down on a 
white sheet before the grave of an ancestor in Hakata, southwestern Japan. He 
left a note that said: "Because the emperor died, now I cannot live any more."

FIRMS INVOLVED IN ALLEGED TOXIC ARMS PLANT, SOURCES SAY

The Bonn government has secured evidence that West German firms helped Libya 
build an alleged chemical weapons plant, government sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
"As of yesterday we are in possession of evidence which shows that the American 
allegations are not groundless," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State George P. Shultz gave Chancellor Helmut Kohl a list in 
November of West German firms that Washington says helped Libya build the plant 
at Rabta, near Tripoli. Libya insists the plant will be used to produce 
medicines. 
</P>
<P>
The first company named by the United States, Imhausen-Chemie, was cleared last 
week in an initial inquiry by West German finance authorities. The firm has 
categorically denied having anything to do with the plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Viewpoint 
</P>
<P>
But a government source said, "Imhausen will not be able to extricate itself 
from the matter now." 
</P>
<P>
The source said it was still unclear if Imhausen had been involved directly or 
through intermediaries in the construction of the plant, and whether the firm 
knew it could be used to build chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The government sources said the evidence they now have appears to support 
reports in the West German and U.S. media that Imhausen and IBI Engineering, a 
Frankfurt firm owned by Ihsan Barbouti, an Iraqi living in London, were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government has urged the United States to give more evidence to back 
up its charges of widespread involvement by West German firms in the Rabta 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inaction Defended 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has criticized Washington for what he called a concerted anti-German 
media campaign, repeated today that Bonn had been right not to act on what he 
called speculation against West German companies. 
</P>
<P>
"In a law-abiding state one cannot base one's work on speculation. That in my 
view is completely unacceptable," Kohl told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In The Hague, a private newsletter for diplomats, Media Monitor, said Dutch 
intelligence officials knew more than two years ago of Libyan plans to build a 
chemical arms plant in Rabta. 
</P>
<P>
They learned of the plans when a Dutch businessman began seeking bids for the 
plant in Western Europe, it said. 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry spokesman said Dutch intelligence had known for some time 
that Libya was building a plant for chemical products. He would not say whether 
it was known that chemical weapons were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Media Monitor said the Dutch businessman had been told he would receive 
compensation for a business the Libyans had nationalized only if he helped 
Tripoli obtain contracts for the design of a chemical weapons plant.

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball, accused of killing two teen-agers while 
driving drunk, pleaded guilty today on the first day of his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball faces up to 22 years in prison on the two counts of drunk-driving 
manslaughter. Sentencing was set for Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete had originally pleaded not guilty, and a jury was selected Tuesday 
to hear the case. Opening arguments were delivered today, and the first witness 
had testified when attorneys asked to enter the guilty pleas before Circuit 
Judge Harry Lee Coe. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball killed two youths Aug. 1 when his sports car roared through a dead-end 
street in Brandon known as "the spot." The area was a hangout for teen-agers 
and was filled with young people at the time. Four other teen-agers were 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, 25, won a silver medal in platform diving at the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles. The accident came just weeks after the tryouts for the Seoul Olympics, 
but Kimball still competed, despite vociferous opposition from Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving. He failed to qualify for the team.

REAGAN MAKING LAST STAB AT SELLING NAVAL OIL RESERVE

<P>
President Reagan is making one last stab at selling off the Naval Petroleum 
Reserve, telling Congress to unload it or else. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of trying unsuccessfully to persuade Congress that the 
government should get out of the oil business, Reagan in his final budget this 
week tied the sale of the reserves to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"He is telling Congress that if they don't sell (the Naval Petroleum Reserve), 
they had better find the money somewhere else to fill up the SPR," a 
congressional staffer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan proposal will be endorsed by President-elect Bush when he takes over 
later this month, Administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House plan calls for the sale in fiscal year 1990 of the Naval 
Petroleum Reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo., for a bonus 
payment of $1 billion. Under the proposed terms, the purchaser would be 
required to deliver 50,000 barrels per day for five years to the SPR salt domes 
along the Gulf Coast. Additionally, the buyer would also have to provide 10 
million barrels of oil to a newly established Defense Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress balks at selling the Naval Reserves, so-called because they were 
established to keep Navy ships in fuel in emergencies, the SPR would be filled 
at a rate of only 22,000 barrels a day in fiscal 1990 under Reagan's plan since 
the Energy Department would get only $127 million for this purpose.

Concerted intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and several European central 
banks succeeded in knocking down the dollar in active trading today. 
</P>
<P>
But the market's short-term bullish sentiment still helped the currency bounce 
up from its session lows. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were down. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the first orchestrated intervention of the year, with 
moderate participation by the Fed, the West German Bundesbank and the central 
banks of Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, added a note 
of caution to trading. 
</P>
<P>
But they said it didn't stop the market from testing higher levels again. 
</P>
<P>
"The intervention wasn't enough to completely dent the dollar's ambitions," 
said Nigel Green, assistant foreign exchange director at EBC Amro Bank. "The 
market is likely to play a cat and mouse game with the central banks for the 
next few days." 
</P>
<P>
Strong U.S. interest rates and technical factors have been helping the dollar 
in recent weeks, although one trader said the overall long-term outlook was 
somewhat bearish. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook will be bearish until we see or hear some very positive news on 
the U.S. trade and budget front," he said, referring to the twin deficits. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.25 yen to a closing 126.95 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 
126.15 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the British pound in London. Sterling fetched $1.7815, 
up from $1.7643 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $403.50 an ounce, compared with 
$404.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $403.30 an ounce, up from 
$405.10.

Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.70 to close at a bid $404.48.

FORD OFFERS 4.9% RATE, REBATES ON 4 MODELS

<P>
Ford Motor Co. today fired the first round in what could be a new auto 
incentives war, announcing that it is offering 4.9% financing programs on four 
models, or cash rebates of around $750. 
</P>
<P>
Ford also announced huge rebates of up to $3,000 for some 1988-model cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said it is offering the 4.9% rate on 24-month loans on its 1989 Ford 
Escort and Festiva small cars, Mercury Tracer subcompact and the Ford Ranger 
small truck. 
</P>
<P>
It is offering a 3.9% financing rate on Tracer models sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, buyers can choose cash rebates of $300 and $400 on Festiva 
models, $500 on Escort, $750 on Tracer and $500 to $750 off Ranger truck 
models. 
</P>
<P>
Ford also said it would offer big rebates on leftover 1988 cars. The largest 
incentive, $3,000, is being offered on the Merkur XR4Ti model, discontinued 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other big rebates on last year's models include $2,000 off on 1988 Scorpio 
models, $1,000 off on 1988 Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and Mercury Cougar XR7, 
and $600 off on other 1988 Thunderbird and Cougar models. Ford recently brought 
out restyled versions of the two autos. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford rebate and incentive offers run through March 2. Ford's previous 
incentive offer was scheduled to expire Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Vice President Robert Rewey, head of North American sales operations, said 
the low-interest rate programs were prompted by concern over consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We achieved significant sales gains in our cars and trucks during 1988, and 
sales continue to look good overall in the first 10 days of the new year, but 
slowly climbing interest rates are causing some customer concern," Rewey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said car buyers told Ford that they would like to have an option of cash 
allowances or low-rate financing to better fit their needs.

Household International Inc., the diversified financial services company that 
owns Household Finance, today announced a restructuring that will eliminate its 
manufacturing holdings through spinoffs and asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
Household's shares surged $4.675 to $61.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in 
reaction to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Household's stockholders will receive shares in three new 
companies to be created from operations that make up most of its Household 
Manufacturing subsidiary. Six units will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the transactions will be to reduce debt and sharpen the company's 
focus on financial services. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing unit's 1988 sales amounted to more than $1 billion and 
represented more than 20% of the total sales and profits for the company, based 
in Prospect Heights, Ill. Its businesses ranged from Thermos Inc., maker of 
insulated consumer products, to Scotsman ice makers and GC-Thorsen tools. 
</P>
<P>
"These actions are intended to create more focused entities and should increase 
the value of Household shareholders' investment," Chairman Donald Clark said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Household shareholders will receive shares of Eljer Industries Inc., a building 
products company; Schwitzer Inc., which makes turbochargers, engine cooling 
systems and vibration dampers, and Scotsman Industries Inc., which makes 
commercial ice makers and drink dispensing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
April Distribution 
</P>
<P>
The distribution, at a ratio of one new share of each of the three spun off 
units for every five shares of Household International, is planned for April 
15. It is subject to various approvals, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's investment banking adviser, J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., said the 
shares of the manufacturing division will trade "at higher market valuations 
than these businesses are now accorded as part of Household International." 
</P>
<P>
Among the six units of Household that will be sold are Albion Industries, which 
makes heavy duty casters for material handling; King-Seeley, a supplier of 
cooking appliance controls and timers; Omni Products International, a supplier 
of leisure furniture, and WaterTest Corp., which provides water testing 
services.

NCAA TIGHTENS ACADEMIC RULE FOR FRESHMEN

NCAA Division I delegates reversed themselves today and toughened Proposition 
48, which governs freshman academic eligibility standards. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 163 to 154, the large schools eliminated the partial qualifier 
category, which pertains to high school graduates who meet only part of the 
eligibility standards. About 600 partial qualifiers have been admitted each 
year for the last three years, an NCAA staff member said. The new provision 
takes effect Aug. 1, 1990, and will not affect anyone now in school. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the same schools defeated the proposal 159 to 151, but it is not 
uncommon for delegates to reconsider items. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argued that eliminating the partial qualifier would "send a stronger 
message" to high school students and teachers that they must emphasize academic 
achievement in order to play at NCAA schools. 
</P>
<P>
A partial qualifier is a high school graduate whose overall grade-point average 
is 2.0 but who fails to meet minimum test score requirements or post a 2.0 
average in required college preparatory courses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bias Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said eliminating the partial qualifier would tend to be hardest on 
inner-city youths and those from disadvantaged backgrounds who, they believe, 
generally score lower on standardized college entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
Several black delegates criticized the elimination of the partial qualifier as 
showing bias against minority students.

"It's unfair not only for minorities but for persons of low income," said Al 
Avant, athletic director at Chicago State University. "But whether or not that 
proposal passed, Proposition 48 is a failure. It's just an attempt by the NCAA 
to look good." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Chandler-Williams, faculty representative of Clark College in Georgia, 
also viewed the action harshly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical of the exploitation of minorities by the NCAA," she said. "I see 
that all the way down the line." 
</P>
<P>
The change occurred a day after the delegates to the 87th NCAA convention 
decided to keep the three-year-old Proposition 48 rule intact, either defeating 
or withdrawing several measures to alter freshman eligibility standards.

WEST DENIES LAKERS WILL PUT KAREEM ON THE BENCH

Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West has denied a published report 
that he is considering making six-time NBA Most Valuable Player Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar a backup center. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point and time, everything that was written was asinine," West said 
about an article published today in the Daily Breeze of Torrance. "Nothing's 
going on right now." 
</P>
<P>
The story said that Abdul-Jabbar, at 41 the oldest player in NBA history as 
well as the league's all-time leading scorer, would average 14 minutes per game 
in a backup role. 
</P>
<P>
Also, unidentified sources close to the two-time defending NBA champions were 
quoted as saying the club is actively pursuing a trade that would bring Indiana 
forward Herb Williams to Los Angeles in exchange for Laker forward Orlando 
Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge was signed to a five-year contract last summer after he became a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
The story was written Tuesday night, after the Lakers suffered their eighth 
straight road loss, a 106-97 decision at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
West was quoted in the story as saying: "I won't confirm or deny that 
speculation. I will say this: If we ever ask Kareem to evaluate his status it 
would be out of respect for everything he's done for this franchise. Our 
primary interest is that he goes out with the dignity he's earned over a great 
career." 
</P>
<P>
West met with Pacer executives Donnie Walsh and George Irvine over the weekend, 
the Breeze quoted their sources as saying. The newspaper said the 
Williams-Woolridge trade was "among other possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh and Irvine attended the two Laker games -- at the Forum in nearby 
Inglewood on Sunday and Tuesday night in Sacramento -- where the Lakers equaled 
their longest road losing streak since the team moved to Los Angeles in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Lakers coach Pat Riley said he still plans on starting Abdul-Jabbar, but he 
added: "We need something to shake things up. I believe the road defeats are 
mental, and our grading system shows some players are 100% less effective on 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Abdul-Jabbar tried to evade reporters while heading for the team 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing effectively," was all the team captain would say. 
Abdul-Jabbar played only 17 minutes against Sacramento.

Atlanta Falcons strong safety Robert Moore has undergone arthroscopic surgery 
on his right knee, the NFL club announced today. The Falcons said Moore, 24, 
injured the knee in the final game of the season against New Orleans. Team 
doctor John Garrett said Moore, who started all 16 games and had 117 tackles 
and five interceptions, is expected to be released from the hospital Thursday 
and will begin a six-month rehabilitation program.

City police turned reporters away from the Cincinnati Bengals' practice complex 
today after the team, preparing to play Jan. 22 in the Super Bowl, abruptly 
canceled a scheduled news conference with coach Sam Wyche. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche decided to cancel the meeting with reporters because he needed the time 
to prepare for the Super Bowl game against the San Francisco 49ers, said Allan 
Heim, the Bengals' director of public relations. The Bengals had previously 
issued a media advisory to reporters in which the NFL team said Wyche would be 
available at specified times every day this week. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers stopped reporters at the gate of the Bengals' Spinney Field 
training complex to say the facility was closed to the press. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche had already spent some time Monday and Tuesday with reporters and will be 
available to them Thursday and Friday, so he decided to cancel today's session.
