PETER COOKSON; ACTOR AND WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Cookson, 76, an actor and writer best known in the theatrical world for 
his portrayal in 1947 of Morris Townsend, the fortune-seeking philanderer in 
"The Heiress." Often working with his wife, actress Beatrice Straight, 
Cookson's career as a stage actor was busiest in the 1940s both on and off 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
He went to New York for "The Heiress," based on the Henry James novel 
"Washington Square," after studying and performing at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
He appeared opposite and later married Straight, who portrayed the plain but 
wealthy protagonist in the play. In the 1950s he produced "The Innocents" and 
in 1953 was the male lead in the Cole Porter musical "Can-Can." Most recently 
he had published a novel, "Henderson's Head," and a play, "Pigeons." In 1984 
his play "Unique Species" was staged to unflattering reviews at Los Angeles' 
Pan Andreas Theatre. In Southfield, Mass., of bone cancer on Saturday.

FATHER OLIVARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Claretian priest living and working at La Placita church, I take exception 
to many inaccuracies in Rodolfo Acuna's column "A Uniquely Needy Flock Mustn't 
Lose Its Padre" (California Commentary, Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
* The transfer of Father Luis Olivares will not mean "a weakening of the 
church's commitment to the cause of social justice . . . " or " . . . also mean 
a loss of faith." 
</P>
<P>
There is a very long list of Claretian priests and brothers, and dedicated 
parishioners, since 1910 who have labored for the poor, the immigrant, and the 
Hispanic for social justice. 
</P>
<P>
* Father Olivares' initial term of three years was renewed; even after six 
years as pastor, special permission was sought from Rome to allow him three 
more years, a total of nine years as pastor! 
</P>
<P>
* There are other dedicated Mexican American Claretians who offered to be 
considered as the new pastor. They have credentials not only of words, but of 
feeding and clothing the poor. 
</P>
<P>
* I personally have not seen Rodolfo Acuna at La Placita. We welcome his 
presence -- and that of his students -- to come and bring clothes for the poor, 
and perhaps come once a week to feed the hungry! 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Acuna mentions a demonstration at St. Basil's church 20 years ago. What 
he fails to mention is that at Communion time, a member of the self-proclaimed 
group, Catolicos por la Raza, took the consecrated host, yelled a slogan, and 
threw the consecrated host to the floor! After that moment, this group lost all 
support in the Hispanic Catholic community! 
</P>
<P>
* La Placita will continue to be a haven for the poor as long as the Claretian 
priests and brothers are given the privilege of working here.

<P>
An open letter to Jesse Jackson: 
</P>
<P>
The world has changed since we both walked behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a 
quarter-century ago. Still, we share that shining memory and, I suppose, a 
common allegiance to our country and its people. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, we differ on many issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, I have to say I find your column on Panama not only mean-spirited but 
riddled with error. Let me point out the most egregious. Do you really think 
that "democracy is not created at the point of a bayonet"? What did 
Washington's brave, beleaguered army carry on their bayonets in 1776, then? 
What did the GIs splashing ashore in Normandy and across France into Germany 
bring, if not democracy? What brought democracy to Japan, if not bayonets? What 
but bayonets brought down Ceausescu, and may yet bring democracy to Romania? 
You deplore bayonets in Panama? Perhaps you preferred Noriega? 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the Panamanian people appear to disagree with you, but the General 
Assembly of the United Nations, for the first time in years, failed to muster a 
majority condemning the United States in a vote on this issue. Think about it.

THE DEMOCRATS' IRRESPONSIBLE ROGUE;

<P>
POLITICS: NO MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN IS AS FAR TO THE RIGHT AS JESSE JACKSON IS 
TO THE LEFT -- AND HE'S THE STAR OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

American Spectator.

<TEXT>
<P>
Which aspiring Democratic presidential candidate compares the American 
military's action in Panama with the massacre of defenseless protesters in Tian 
An Men Square by the loathsome Chinese 27th Army? The redoubtable Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
When the average American is asked to name the most prominent Democrat in the 
country, whom do you suppose he names most frequently? Is it the benign Speaker 
of the House? You know, Congressman What's-His-Name, the one who just had his 
dog, Alice, put to sleep? You know, the one who replaced that wheeler-dealer 
Texan, Jim Wright? No, he is not the most prominent Democrat. Well, would it be 
the congressman who had the homosexual prostitute staying in his home, or, 
perhaps, the recent House whip who absconded from Washington before the Ethics 
Committee sent a posse out to haul him in? No, again. The most prominent 
Democrat of all is either Sen. Edward Kennedy, the guy whose Oldsmobile could 
not swim, or, perhaps a point or two more frequently mentioned, Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Thus I think we can all see why, absent Jackson on the national scene, the 
Democrats would be in rather bad odor with the American people. With Jackson on 
the scene they are in worse odor. There are many nice, polite Democrats at all 
levels of American government. Their problem is that there are also many 
irresponsible rogues among the party's eminences and Jackson is the most 
irresponsible of all. He is not just insufferable. He is a left-wing rigorist 
whose presence reminds ordinary Americans that not all anti-Americans live in 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
It is the misfortune of mainstream Democrats that about the time that former 
Sen. George McGovern won the Democratic presidential nomination, these 
left-wing anti-Americans gained a hoof-hold in the Democratic Party. They have 
not been dislodged. Many are as far to the left as various right-wing fringe 
groups are far to the right, but right-wing fringe groups are beyond the bounds 
of the Republican Party. Left-wing fringe groups, as alienated from America as 
are their right-wing equivalents, now figure prominently at every Democratic 
presidential convention, and their candidate is Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing our invasion of Panama with the Chinese army's slaughter of its 
fellow citizens in Tian An Men Square is as irrational a flight of malevolence 
as it would be to compare our invasion of Panama with the Soviets' invasions of 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan. No normal mind would think of such a 
wild comparison, but Jackson's did, and he is right now quite possibly the 
front-runner for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. He said that our 
action was similar to those Soviet invasions. He said that we had lost our 
claim to moral high ground. He said that our troops were burying Panamanian 
civilians "in mass graves," and that the corpses numbered more than 1,200. This 
he declared when most estimates settled on 300 civilians killed (the official 
U.S. government figure is now 220), and when there was relief on all sides that 
the tyrant Noriega was in irons. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the statements of an ordinary Democrat, an ordinary black 
Democrat or even an ordinary liberal Democrat. They are the statements of a 
far-out left-wing zealot receiving ideas from fringe groups such as something 
called the Caribbean Action Lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's spokesman cites the Caribbean Action Lobby as his source of the 
intelligence on Panama. It is an organization that is very hard to track down. 
A Washington journalist tried and finally found a telephone number somewhere in 
Brooklyn, where a somewhat distracted woman, speaking over the din of noisy 
children, suggested calling back in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that is the enlightened source of this prominent presidential candidate's 
utterances, and he ventilates his extremist claptrap regularly, sometimes on 
national television, sometimes before distinguished Democratic audiences. Early 
this month at a prayer service honoring New York's Mayor David Dinkins, he 
declared Christ's birthplace "under occupation" by Israel. Well, those who now 
occupy Bethlehem are its original inhabitants, Christ's fellow Jews. But that 
is not what Jackson meant. Once again he was making an extremist point from the 
swales of the far left.

CUT A RISING, REGRESSIVE TAX, UNMASK THE MONSTER DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SECURITY: REVENUES ARE BEING USED FOR THE SLOW, SURREPTITIOUS 
SEMI-REPEAL OF A GREAT LIBERAL ACHIEVEMENT: HEAVY RELIANCE ON THE INCOME TAX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first tick of the clock on New Year's Day triggered another phase of one of 
the nine tax increases of the nine Reagan-Bush years. And this year will be 
just 23 days old when Sen. Pat Moynihan proposes a bill to repeal this most 
recent tax increase, and thereby begin to stop "the leakage of reality from 
American life." 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) would repeal the Social Security tax hike. That increase was 
proposed by the 1983 Greenspan Commission, of which he was a member. He also 
would further cut the Social Security tax rate on Jan. 1, 1991. This would 
sharply increase the reported budget deficit (by $62 billion through 1991 
alone), but only by revealing what the government's real operating deficit is. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's measure would stop the swelling of a huge Social Security surplus. 
By including that surplus (and those of other trust funds) in the unified 
budget, the real deficit -- approaching $300 billion -- is cut in half, 
cosmetically. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenspan Commission proposed the Social Security tax increases to build 
reserves for the population "bubble" of baby-boom retirees next century. But 
the reserves are not being reserved. They are being spent, masking the real 
deficit. So either way, large tax increases will be needed in the future. By 
making it official that Social Security is an intergenerational 
transfer-payment program, on a pay-as-you-go basis, Moynihan would make the 
real deficit -- the gap between government outlays and non-Social Security 
revenues -- visible. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan is practicing sauce-for-the-gander politics, doing for Democrats what 
Reagan and Stockman did to Democrats. In 1981, Reagan and Stockman said to 
themselves, in effect: Maybe our tax cuts will be self-financing -- so 
stimulative to the economy that no deficit will occur. But if not, the deficits 
will serve a political good by applying pressure for restraint on the growth of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan denounced this reckless abuse of fiscal policy for political purposes. 
But now he, too, is willing, and rightly so, to reduce the revenue base of the 
government for therapeutic purposes. In 1983, he supported the schedule of 
Social Security tax increases on the assumption that the surpluses would be put 
to some use other than the perpetuation of fraud, the disguising of the 
government's operating deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Moynihan's proposal would confront the government with the need either 
to make politically difficult spending cuts or adopt more candid, rational and 
equitable revenue sources to shrink the real huge deficit, suddenly made 
visible. Alas, as the 1980s showed, there is a third course -- a borrowing 
binge to finance the deficits. However, a necessary precondition for sound 
policy is a willingness to face facts, such as this: After five years under 
Gramm-Rudman, the government's operating deficit is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Some liberals may flinch from Moynihan's radical budget surgery. Because 
taxophobia is the strongest political passion today, some liberals believe that 
the flow of Social Security tax dollars is necessary for domestic spending 
programs. But liberals cannot remain liberals and remain collaborators in the 
current process whereby Social Security revenues are used for the slow, 
surreptitious semi-repeal of a great liberal achievement: the 16th Amendment, 
and heavy reliance on the income tax. 
</P>
<P>
This has been happening, with the connivance of a Democratic-controlled 
Congress. Federal taxes in the first year of the Bush Administration are about 
what they were in the last year of the Carter Administration, around 19% of 
GNP. What the "Reagan revolution" changed radically is the incidence of 
taxation. Income taxes were cut and made less progressive. The regressive 
Social Security tax rate (the same rate for all payers; income above $51,300 is 
exempt) increased 25% in the 1980s. Now the burden of the Social Security tax 
(including the employer's share) is larger than the income-tax burden for 74% 
of all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives, too, should rally 'round Moynihan, and not just because some of 
them have never met a tax cut they didn't like. Thoughtful conservatives fear 
that the Social Security surplus, perhaps supplemented by a "peace dividend" 
carved from the defense budget, may be used by liberals to fund new government 
programs, perhaps addressing the most pervasive anxiety of the 1990s -- health 
care for an aging population of parents who caused the baby boom. 
</P>
<P>
Spending, say, $50 billion on a continuing basis for a politically well-crafted 
program could, says Texas' Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, "move millions of 
votes." Gramm fears a paradox: The anti-communist rebellion against statism in 
the Soviet Bloc could give rise to a defense-cutting euphoria that, combined 
with Social Security surpluses, results in too much government here. 
</P>
<P>
That is one possible choice. But before the choosing begins, Moynihan's bill, a 
blow for candor and equity, should be passed. It would deprive Democrats and 
Republicans of the choice of continuing the pretense that the deficit is 
disappearing.

<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: A COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE, HOWEVER FRAGILE AND UNCERTAIN, SEEMS TO 
BE EMERGING. WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO NOURISH AND ENCOURAGE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN J. COHEN, Herman J. Cohen is assistant secretary of state for African 
affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although overshadowed by events in Eastern Europe, the political climate in 
South Africa, too, is undergoing significant change. South Africans, black and 
white, are shaking off old assumptions and rigidities and contemplating fresh 
approaches to differences that seemed irreconcilable even a year ago. The 
evolving process is still fragile and uncertain, but there is new hope on all 
sides that it may yet prove possible to reach agreement on a peaceful 
transition to a non-racial, democratic society in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's meeting between then-President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson 
Mandela, imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, was a signal of 
the South African government's recognition that the country's future cannot be 
settled unless there is dialogue with credible opposition leaders. Internal and 
external pressures, among which sanctions are only one element, have helped 
persuade South African leaders that the well-being of the white minority cannot 
be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in 
political equality for all South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming a mandate for change after last fall's elections, President Frederik 
W. de Klerk has taken a number of encouraging steps to get this process under 
way. He has permitted peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and rallies, freed 
leading political prisoners, announced plans to discard the Separate Amenities 
Act, scaled down the state security apparatus and met with credible black 
leaders, including Mandela. It is premature to predict whether these steps will 
lead to a continuing dialogue, but they constitute tangible evidence that 
things are changing, and they offer reason for hope. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long regarded dialogue among all South Africans as the 
most important first step in the process of change. Moves that would further 
enhance prospects for dialogue include: an end to violence on all sides; the 
release of all political prisoners, including Mandela; the lifting of the state 
of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity and freedom of 
association for the black opposition, and the unbanning of all political 
organizations, including the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy toward South Africa is guided by five basic principles: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unequivocal opposition to apartheid; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Commitment to building a post-apartheid democratic South Africa through 
assistance to black South Africans; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Active U.S. diplomacy to resolve conflicts and support economic development 
throughout southern Africa; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cooperation with our allies and other concerned nations in a multilateral 
approach to South Africa; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maintenance of a bipartisan consensus with Congress on our general approach 
to the region. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the anti-apartheid movement must look beyond the rhetoric of the 
past to find creative ways of responding to the unexpected opportunities that 
may now be arising. Anti-apartheid activists should work to achieve consensus 
among diverse and often hostile opposition elements, and to formulate 
constructive principles for the negotiating process that may be emerging. There 
are signs that such an effort, with the support of the international community, 
is already beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has indicated that it is taking the possibility of dialogue seriously. 
Its expressed preference for the path of negotiated and peaceful settlement was 
endorsed in 1989 by the Organization of African Unity. The consensus 
declaration adopted at the conclusion of the United Nations special session on 
apartheid Dec. 14 not only urged the people of South Africa to join together to 
negotiate an end to apartheid; it also postulated fundamental principles that 
could constitute the basis for an internationally acceptable solution in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a non-racial, democratic South Africa is not yet at hand. While their 
overall numbers have diminished, political detainees, including Nelson Mandela, 
are still in custody, the state of emergency remains in effect and 
black-on-black violence has not abated. But there is a growing sense that the 
majority of South Africans of all races may be ready to seize this opportunity 
to break out of the isolation imposed by apartheid and rejoin the international 
community of free nations. 
</P>
<P>
The United States stands ready, through contact with all parties, to do 
everything possible to promote this process. And we hope that negotiations and 
peaceful change, as called for in the recent U.N. declaration, will become the 
norm for the international community's approach to South Africa.

AZTECS ARE LEFT INSIDE

LARAMIE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wyoming's control of the inside, especially by sophomore forward Reginald 
Slater, and a dismal performance at the free throw line had the San Diego State 
men's basketball team in trouble most of the way Thursday night and resulted in 
a 76-60 Western Athletic Conference loss in front of 8,203 at Wyoming's 
Arena-Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, whose mother was hospitalized in Houston earlier in the day with an 
undisclosed illness, scored 22 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while dominating 
on both ends of the floor. He had 12 rebounds in the second half, seven on 
offense, and reached double figures in both scoring and rebounding for the 
eighth time in 14 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Slater turned his mind to family concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried my eyes out after the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs fell to 9-7 and 1-2 in the WAC with their third consecutive loss in 
Laramie. Wyoming improved to 9-5 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
As much damage as Slater and the Cowboys' inside game caused -- they also set a 
team single-game record with 15 blocked shots and had a 50-40 rebounding 
advantage -- SDSU did at least as much to self-destruct at the foul line. The 
two teams shot 74 free throws but with wildly varying rates of success. The 
Aztecs made just 17 of 36; the Cowboys were 32 for 38 and made 13 in a row in 
the last seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a nice job on the free throws, didn't we?" SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg 
asked sarcastically. "Free throws become a confidence thing. We spend plenty of 
time on it. Missed free throws and missed layups caused problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed, 36-27, at halftime. Center Marty Dow then did his best to 
drag them back into the game, taking a 44-35 deficit with 16:20 remaining and 
scoring six of SDSU's next nine points to close it to 49-44 with 13 minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wyoming's next possession, Slater had three offensive rebounds. He 
converted the third to give the Cowboys a seven-point lead and start them on a 
12-3 run that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Dow had 21 points on 10-of-14 shooting, plus eight rebounds and a blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Dow hurt us," said Wyoming Coach Benny Dees. "But that will happen when we 
have to put our freshmen on a post player. Dow played an excellent game for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming is the conference's youngest team, starting a senior, three sophomores 
and a freshman. Freshman center Reggie Page had four of the blocked shots.

MORNING BRIEFING: MOTTA IN SACRAMENTO: THE REST OF THE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several NBA reporters raised an eyebrow when Dick Motta was hired to coach the 
Sacramento Kings. Jan Hubbard of Newsday suspects an ulterior motive was 
involved: 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmmmm. Two of the finalists for the Sacramento Kings' job were John MacLeod 
and Bob Weiss. Dick Motta was hired. MacLeod is the guy who replaced Motta when 
Motta left the Dallas Mavericks. MacLeod coached the Mavericks to the Western 
Conference finals, which is further than they ever advanced during seven years 
under Motta. 
</P>
<P>
"And Weiss, who would have been hired had Motta not accepted the job, was 
Motta's assistant in Dallas for six years. But the working relationship between 
the two did not end on ideal terms when Weiss was hired by the San Antonio 
Spurs in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"So could it be possible that Motta saw two guys he either did not respect or 
of whom he was jealous and decided to shaft both of them by taking the Kings 
job? 
</P>
<P>
"Ugly thoughts. And about such a nice, loyal guy." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Through 1989, what high school produced the most NFL players? 
</P>
<P>
Cartoons were on: Rookie guard Doug Widell of the Denver Broncos, asked about 
Earnest Byner's fumble that preserved the Broncos' 38-33 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns in the 1987 AFC championship game: 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't that big of a fan of NFL football when I was in college. I watched 
the Super Bowls, but I get bored watching football games on television. Maybe I 
saw that game, but I probably fell asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Add cartoons: After the Clippers lost to the Detroit Pistons Jan. 3, center 
Benoit Benjamin showered, dressed and began spraying rancid-smelling cologne 
all over himself. Teammate Charles Smith began fanning the air and complaining. 
Benjamin looked at reporters and said, "Might get them out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Question of balance: The New York Knicks' Kenny Walker started three games in 
place of injured Charles Oakley last week. He missed all seven of his shots in 
the first game but made all 10 of his free throws. In the second game, Walker 
was five for seven from the field but two for six from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"Next game it will all come together," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
It did. Walker was one for five from the field and one for four from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Tears of a clown: Frank Layden, who quit as coach of the Utah Jazz last winter, 
on what he would have done differently: "I would have stopped the comic act a 
long time ago. I thought I had to be like Casey Stengel to take people's minds 
off our bad team. But after we got good, I kept joking, and I don't know if 
anyone ever took me seriously as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Bunch of flunkies: Buddy Ryan, coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, gave print 
reporters an A for their reporting this season and assessed TV reporters a 
B-minus. Ryan said: "Radio guys, you guys are down in the Gs. That's even below 
Fs." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Big Spring High in Big Spring, Tex., 11. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Notre Dame football Coach Lou Holtz on Bo Schembechler, new 
president of the Detroit Tigers: "I just love to listen to Bo talk. Maybe it's 
because I don't have much choice when we're together." GARR KLUENDER

TV-RADIO: HE'S NOT A GENIUS, BUT HIS GRADES ARE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Walsh may have a future in broadcasting after all. At least he's 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who will team with Dick Enberg on NBC's coverage of Sunday's AFC 
championship game between Cleveland and Denver, admits his first season has 
been tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season I was having quite a few bad games," he said. "I'd have a 
good game, then a bad game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think I've reduced the number of those games and been more effective the 
last five games." 
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty accurate evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had his best game last Sunday, when he was particularly candid and 
opinionated during Denver's one-point win over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
About Walsh's troubles, partner Dick Enberg said: "He's had a heavy load to 
carry. Commentators have to do a lot more than just provide commentary. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be story-telling was the responsibility of the play-by-play man, 
but now it's a role for the commentator. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also had to learn to work the telestrator, and I think he's now doing it 
as well as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Said Walsh: "I think I've learned that you'd better just be yourself in this 
role. There's only one John Madden, and only one Dan Dierdorf. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be myself and let the viewers decide whether I have a sense of humor 
and if I can be interesting." 
</P>
<P>
As for his attempts at humor, Walsh said: "Sometimes Dick forces me to 
rehearse. But what I hope comes across is that Dick and I really enjoy each 
other's company." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed at times during last Sunday's Ram-Giant game that CBS announcers Pat 
Summerall and John Madden were Giant announcers. 
</P>
<P>
It was not that they openly rooted for New York, but too often they were 
telling viewers what the Giants were doing right or what the Giants were doing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
They may have been affected by CBS executives, most of whom live in New York 
and cheer for the Giants, although Bob Stenner, the producer of the telecast, 
is from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Madden, in particular, irked Ram fans by saying the pass interference call in 
overtime that set up the winning touchdown shouldn't have been called. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm against is such a marginal call being made at that point of the 
game," Madden said this week after arriving back at his home in the Bay Area. 
"It doesn't matter who it's on." 
</P>
<P>
Summerall and Madden remain the best announcing team in pro football, and 
besides working Sunday's NFC title game between the Rams and San Francisco, 
they will also work the Super Bowl on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
A reminder: With both conference championship games being played in the West, 
the AFC game doesn't start until 10:30 a.m., PST, and the NFC game starts at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl in New Orleans will also start at 2 p.m., PST. 
</P>
<P>
Madden, who travels from game to game by bus, said he still enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was always on the bus, it might get to me," he said. "But I can make it 
across the country in two days. We left the Meadowlands at 5 p.m. Eastern time 
on Sunday, and I was home by 5 p.m. our time Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound not only provides Madden with his bus but also with two drivers who 
alternate shifts. So the bus is going almost the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Going in, Monday night's pay-per-view fight between George Foreman and Gerry 
Cooney seems to be the most-ridiculed bout in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS boxing commentator Gil Clancy, who, in his younger days, trained world 
champions Emile Griffith and Ken Buchanan, thinks the criticism is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, who took some time off from CBS to train Cooney, said: "I know Gerry is 
taking this fight seriously. He's in the best shape of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, 67, who once trained Foreman, said he agreed to handle Cooney after a 
meeting with the 33-year-old fighter who has had only two bouts since 1984 and 
none in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to see him work out and could tell he was dead serious," Clancy said 
from Atlantic City, N.J., the site of the fight. "I liked what I saw and I 
liked what he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked his potential when he was a 17-year-old kid, but he was never handled 
by the right people." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, who was a commentator on the pay-per-view telecast of the recent Sugar 
Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran fight, goes back to work for CBS on Jan. 27, when 
Lindell Holmes and Frank Tate square off in New Orleans as a part of Super Bowl 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's undercard begins at 6 p.m., the main event about 7:30. 
Highlighting the undercard is a scheduled 12-round middleweight bout between 
Doug DeWitt and Matthew Hilton, a substitute for injured Iran Barkley but a 
hard puncher. 
</P>
<P>
The main event is scheduled for 10 rounds but doesn't figure to go that long. 
</P>
<P>
Most cable companies are charging $20 for the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Awards show: The Ace Awards, cable television's Emmy Awards, will be presented 
Sunday night, during a show televised from 5 to 7:30 p.m., at the Wiltern 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen cable networks, including TBS, TNT and SportsChannel America, will 
televise the show. 
</P>
<P>
Individual nominees in sports categories include Chris Berman, Mike Patrick and 
Dick Vitale of ESPN, Roy Firestone for "Sportslook," Jim Lampley for HBO boxing 
and Marv Albert for Knicks basketball on the Madison Square Garden network. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Namath and Dinah Shore are among the hosts. Mike Tyson and Don King are 
among the presenters. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
KFI's Joe McDonnell says he will break a new twist to how the Raiders may be 
kept in Los Angeles on his talk show Sunday night. McDonnell said he will have 
guests on during the 9 o'clock hour who have a plan for keeping the Raiders in 
Los Angeles County but not necessarily at the Coliseum. . . . KMPC has gotten a 
jump on the Angel season. The radio station is already carrying "Angel Update," 
a weekly call-in show on Wednesday nights, with Al Conin and Ken Brett. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13's Vic (the Brick) Jacobs was among the guests on HBO's "First and

Channel 7's Jim Hill will receive the Westwood Shrine Club's Sports Achievement 
Award at a dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel Jan. 17. Stu Nahan will be the 
master of ceremonies. . . . The way Channel 4's Fred Roggin treated the story 
about a possible one-on-one game between Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, you

earlier.

Phil Henderson said it was a case of making the last run stick as 10th-ranked 
Duke ended No. 9 Georgia Tech's perfect record with a 96-91 Atlantic Coast 
Conference victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who led the Blue Devils with 26 points, called the game "a 
dogfight." 
</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner added 23 points for Duke (11-2, 2-0), which ended a 
five-game losing streak at Atlanta by overcoming a 10-point deficit in the 
final nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson scored seven points and Laettner hit five free throws in a 17-2 run 
after Tech (10-1, 1-1) had taken a 78-68 lead with just under nine minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Louisville 79, S. Carolina 66 -- Keith Williams made eight of nine shots 
in scoring a career-high 24 points as the Cardinals won a Metro Conference game 
at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Williams scored eight of his team's first 14 points to help Louisville (11-2, 
1-1) take a 36-18 halftime lead over the error-prone, cold-shooting Gamecocks 
(5-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 86, No. 16 Minnesota 78 -- Ryan Berning scored all 13 of his points in 
the final nine minutes, including six free throws in the final 71 seconds, as 
the Boilermakers snapped the Gophers' 10-game winning streak in a Big Ten game 
at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (10-2, 2-0) led 43-30 at halftime and stretched it to 71-53 before the 
Gophers (10-2, 1-1) staged a rally in the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane 81, No. 20 Memphis St. 80 -- Michael Christian hit a three-pointer with 
28 seconds left to give the Green Wave a Metro Conference victory in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Reed scored 25 points for Tulane (3-8, 1-2). Memphis State is 9-4 and 
1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Temple 73, W. Virginia 69 -- Mark Macon scored 27 points and Duane Causwell 
made two crucial free throws with five seconds left as the Owls snapped the 
Mountaineers' six-game winning streak in an Atlantic 10 game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Temple (6-5, 4-1) rallied in each half, trailing by as many as 16 points in the 
first half and by 62-54 with 7:53 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 78, N.C. Asheville 54 -- Senior forward Kirkland Howling came off the 
bench to score 17 points, including five of eight three-pointers, at Clemson, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 10-3. N.C. Asheville is 6-6.

balanced attack as the Spartans got their 1,000th basketball victory in a Big 
Ten game at East Lansing, Mich.

ARIZONA PULLS AWAY, BEATS USC, 90-75; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TROJANS GET 19 POINTS FROM MINER IN FIRST HALF AND TRAIL BY ONLY 
ONE AT THE INTERMISSION. 
</P>

USC Coach George Raveling had a premonition that the Trojans would upset No. 18 
Arizona Thursday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll probably think I'm crazy, but to be perfectly honest I felt we were 
going to beat them," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling's prediction didn't look too bad after the first half, when the 
Trojans trailed, 45-44. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Harold Miner played an extraordinary first half, scoring 19 
points. Miner hit five three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wildcats went to a box-and-one defense to slow Miner in the second 
half, holding him to seven points and USC folded, losing 90-75, before 5,043 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pressuring me and reaching in and it was hard to get loose," Miner 
said. "Their defense kind of wore me down." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Matt Muehlebach did a superb job of defending Miner in the second half, 
forcing him to miss five of eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I just played Miner man-to-man," Muehlebach said. "After he hit about five 
shots in a row he was hot. It's a little easier to stay with a guy like Miner 
in a box and one than it is when everybody is playing man." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson praised Muehlebach's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Matt did a good job against Miner," Olson said. "He keyed the 
defensive effort, but it was the help of the others in the box that supported 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Miner just flat out lit us up in the first half. He's so explosive. He didn't 
always have a clear shot in the first half, but he gets up so quickly and they 
were falling for him." 
</P>
<P>
The shots fell for Arizona forward Jud Buechler in the second half. Buechler 
made seven of 14 shots from the field and seven of eight free throws to finish 
with 22 points. He also had 10 rebounds as Arizona (9-2 overall, 4-2 in the 
Pac-10) won its eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"Buechler's the glue that holds Arizona together," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Sean Rooks added 18 points off the bench, and forward Wayne Womack had 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Although Miner was averaging 24 points in his last four games, skeptics pointed 
out that the Trojans had played inferior opponents such as Central Connecticut 
State. 
</P>
<P>
But Miner proved that he can score against good teams as the Trojans outplayed 
Arizona in the first half. Miner made six of 11 shots in the half. 
</P>
<P>
After Miner scored 14 of the Trojans first 20 points, including three 
three-pointers, Arizona paid Miner the ultimate compliment, going to a box and 
one defense against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans lost Ronnie Coleman when he picked up his third foul with 13:26 
left in the first half. But center Chris Munk picked up the slack, scoring 20 
points, including 14 in the first half. Munk hit four of five shots from the 
floor and all six of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Munk hit two free throws with 40 seconds left to give USC a 44-43 lead. But the 
Wildcats worked for the last shot as Rooks fed Buechler for a layup at the 
buzzer to give the Wildcats a 45-44 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Womack led the Wildcats with 11 points in the first half. Brian Williams added 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
USC had trouble getting the ball to Miner in the first nine minutes of the 
second half as Arizona took a 66-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We just seemed to hit a lull in the second half," Raveling said. "We're not at 
the point yet where we can match talent with talent. We have to play a cerebral 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"When we hit that lull in the last two games that's all the opponents needed. 
And when Coleman doesn't have a good game that puts pressure on Miner to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
Muehlebach did a superb job of checking Miner. But the Trojans didn't do a very 
good job of setting any screens for Miner. Miner finally made his first shot of 
the second half with 10:19 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans play Arizona State Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Lyon Center on the USC 
campus. All 2,200 tickets for the game have been sold. The game was moved from 
the Sports Arena due to a conflict with an ice show. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be my first sellout since I've been at SC," Coach George Raveling 
said. "After the game we should take the floor and cut it up and sell it. As 
far as I'm concerned, they can move all of them there for the rest of the 
season. It wouldn't bother me at all. It would help our recruiting. I'd tell 
our recruits come to USC we play before sellout crowds, standing room only 
every night." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Bill Frieder isn't happy with the switch to the Lyon Center. 
"That's something that could never ever happen in the Big Ten," the former 
Michigan coach said. "Playing them in the Lyon Center is going to be a tough, 
tough situation and certainly to their advantage."

<P>
VACATION HELPED EXEMPLARY LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a trainer and an owner put a stakes-class 3-year-old on the shelf halfway 
through a season laden with rich opportunities, you immediately ask, "What went 
wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
And when the trainer answers, "Nothing, we just wanted to back off for a 
while," the immediate reaction is, "Yeah, sure. So where's he going to stud? 
Singapore?" 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of Exemplary Leader, one of several upset possibilities in 
Sunday's San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita, his five-month vacation at the end 
of 1989 should be taken at face value, according to his trainer, Brian 
Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing sixth in the La Jolla Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 6, Exemplary 
Leader was given an easy 2 1/2 months around the barn. He began serious 
training again in October, then resurfaced in the Malibu Stakes on Santa 
Anita's opening day, Dec. 26, to run an impressive second behind the San 
Fernando favorite, Music Merci. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving him time off was an arbitrary decision on my part," said Mayberry, who 
is currently on top in the Santa Anita standings. "With year-round racing, 
you've got to stop sooner or later. I prefer to do it sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Later, added Mayberry, is sometimes too late. A trainer must know when a horse 
hits his peak and when that peak has passed. To do otherwise is to risk 
debilitating illness or a career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very intuitive thing," Mayberry said. 'A lot of guys don't recognize 
when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Exemplary Leader had been in steady training for 18 months when he finally got 
his holiday. He ran seven times as a 2-year-old in 1988 and 10 times before the 
Malibu in '89, winning one stakes and placing in four others for Jan, Mace and 
Samantha Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on Mayberry's recommendation, the Siegels paid $58,000 for Exemplary 
Leader at a 1987 yearling sale in Kentucky. So far, the son of Vigors has 
returned $170,038 on the investment. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard-nosed colt," Mayberry said. "He did most of his maturing between 
the ages of 3 and 4. That's another reason we stopped on him -- his sire didn't 
get really good until he turned 5." 
</P>
<P>
Vigors, dubbed the White Corvette because of his distinctive coat and his 
electrifying acceleration, won only five of 29 starts from ages 2 through 4. As 
a 5-year-old, however, he started just five times and won four major stakes in 
1978, including the Santa Anita Handicap and the San Antonio Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry got lucky this week when Neil Drysdale decided not to run Breeders' 
Cup Turf winner Prized in the San Fernando. That allowed Prized's rider, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, to return on Exemplary Leader after their promising collaboration 
in the Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"This colt likes to make one big run at the end, and Eddie seems to have 
mastered knowing just when to move," Mayberry said. "I don't know if he's quite 
good enough to win Sunday, but I think we've given him a chance to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 35 horses who worked six furlongs Wednesday morning at Santa Anita, the 
slowest was also the best known. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, last seen nipping at Bayakoa's heels at the end of the Breeders' Cup 
Distaff, barely broke a sweat as she strolled along in 1:18 1/5 for the 
distance. The exercise said nothing about her ability, which is considerable, 
and everything about the style of Drysdale, her trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Six days earlier, Drysdale matched the 4-year-old daughter of Slew o' Gold 
against Prized in a "full-pads scrimmage" at about 7 1/2 furlongs. They 
responded with an official seven-furlong clocking of 1:24 1/5 that track 
clockers described as "breezing" rather than "handily," indicating a minimum of 
effort that produced maximum results. 
</P>
<P>
"She went right along in that work," Drysdale said. "Did quite a bit, actually. 
After that, she didn't need anything much more than a 1:16 or a 1:17 on 
Wednesday. Just something to keep her interested." 
</P>
<P>
Racing fans will be watching with interest Monday when Gorgeous returns in the 
El Encino Stakes at 1 1/16 miles. Of all the stars of 1989, Gorgeous was the 
most enigmatic. She ran only six times, popping up at six different tracks in 
California, New York, Kentucky and Florida. She won four races and finished 
second twice, and the only horses to beat her, Bayakoa and Open Mind, were 
later named champions. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, Bayakoa's trainer, singled out Gorgeous as the horse to beat in 
the Nov. 4 Distaff a full two months before the race, despite the fact that 
Open Mind, Goodbye Halo, Miss Brio and Colonial Waters were all making 
headlines at the time. Gorgeous, on the other hand, had just recovered from a 
minor leg injury and was back in light training. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a light-bodied filly, the kind you can't train too hard," McAnally said. 
"I could tell the way Neil was handling her that he was gearing her up to fire 
her best shot when he brought her back. And that's exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale said Gorgeous has put on weight and thickened in the right places. 
Delahoussaye, her rider, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll never be a monster," Delahoussaye said. "She's stronger now, but she 
still has that more refined look you see in those old English paintings. 
Anyway, it's how they look at the finish that counts, and you can't fault her 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect will have no excuses in Saturday's seven-furlong San Carlos 
Handicap. The powerful gelding drew the outside post in a field of nine, 
guaranteeing the clear trip he did not get in the Palos Verdes Handicap on Dec. 
30. The opposition consists of Oraibi, Candi's Gold, Raise a Stanza, On the 
Menu, Tanker Port, Order, Ron Bon and Doncareer, who hung on so well to finish 
third in the Malibu Stakes opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The former European colt, Lowell, makes his main-track debut for trainer 
Richard Cross in today's featured eighth race. Lowell finished a close fourth 
in the Hollywood Derby on Nov. 19, after which he was purchased by Bruce 
McNall. . . . The attractive feature is surrounded by eight claiming races, 
three of them for maidens, proving how difficult it is for even Santa Anita to 
present consistently high-quality programs in this era of year-round 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., has launched an aggressive response to the 
devaluation of two of its major races by the North American Graded Stakes 
Committee. The track will run an ad in all editions of Saturday's Daily Racing 
Form, ridiculing the grading process. In addition, Oaklawn will delete all 
references to race grades in its advertising, programs, and condition books. 
Oaklawn management hit the roof when it was learned the Apple Blossom Handicap 
for older fillies and mares had lost its Grade I rating. Four of the last five 
champions in the division competed in the race, including 1989 winner Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis returned to action Thursday after missing Wednesday's card because 
of what was apparently food poisoning. "Must have been the ski lodge pizza," 
said his agent, Jeff Franklin. "He was back working horses the next morning."

LOYOLA MAKES UP LOST GROUND;

<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER A 2-4 START, THE LADY LIONS IMPROVE RECORD TO 7-7. 
THEY FACE SANTA CLARA IN THE CONFERENCE OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A surging Loyola Marymount women's basketball team has lifted its record to 
.500 (7-7) just in time to take on Santa Clara University in its West Coast 
Conference opener tonight at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
By WCC standards, Loyola is a relatively big team, with three starters 
5-foot-10 or taller, that likes to run. The team is hoping to control the game 
by taking the perimeter shot away from Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be able to dictate the places that Santa Clara is going to be able 
to shoot from," said Loyola Coach Todd Corman. "We have to be able to control 
the boards." 
</P>
<P>
The advantage is definitely in the hands of Loyola, which has had all of its 
victories at home. The only home loss this season came against Arizona State, 
82-72. The Lady Lions are in the middle of a five-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
After upset victories over Fresno State and Georgia Tech, Santa Clara's Lady 
Broncos (4-9) have lost five straight. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clara is definitely a finesse team that doesn't have a tough inside 
game," Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions have won five of their last eight games after a 2-4 start, including 
a 61-50 victory over Cal State Dominguez Hills on Monday. The game was touted 
as a tough matchup and lived up to it. At the end of the first half the score 
was 24-24. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Loyola pulled away to an 11-point lead on the solid play of 
Lynn Flanagan (14 points), Tricia Gibson (13 points, 11 rebounds) and Kristen 
Bruich (13 points, five assists). 
</P>
<P>
"It was something of a letdown when we played Dominguez because we didn't play 
hard the entire game," Corman said. "We know who we are playing and I think we 
played down because it was Division I against Division II." 
</P>
<P>
Bruich, Flanagan and Gibson have provided most of the offensive and defensive 
punch for the Lions. Bruich, a 5-foot-8 junior guard, is averaging 15.1 points 
and leads the conference in steals with an average of 3.9 per game. Flanagan, a 
5-foot-8 junior, is having the best year of her career, scoring 14.3 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, a 6-foot-3 junior center, leads the conference in shot blocking, 
averaging three per game. 
</P>
<P>
The leading scorer for Santa Clara is Julie Lienert at 14.1 per game. Jennifer 
Lucas is leading the conference in assists with an average of 7.3. 
</P>
<P>
The game against Santa Clara is a tuneup for a Saturday night game against the 
University of San Diego (11-3). Corman says this is going to be a pivotal 
weekend that could determine how the rest of the season goes. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego plays at Pepperdine tonight.

<P>
BOWL-GAME INJURY PAINS PARKINSON AS HIS CONCERNS FOR A PRO CAREER GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a simple home movie. It was supposed to be a happy film. 
It was supposed to be the Parkinson family's final chapter in the chronicle of 
the four-year USC football career of their son, Brent, as he played in his 
third and final Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
What was planned was "Chariots of Fire." But what the Parkinsons got, faster 
than you can say medial collateral ligament, was "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, a four-year starter on the USC offensive line, appears on the New 
Year's Day home movie in a blur, charging from the tunnel at the Rose Bowl and 
engaging his teammates in raucous hand-slapping moments before the game against 
Michigan is to begin. At 6-foot-6 and 260 pounds, a few of his zealous 
high-fives nearly topple smaller teammates onto the Rose Bowl turf. 
</P>
<P>
The game begins, and Parkinson is shown hammering away at two Michigan linemen 
in the first few plays. And then, suddenly, he is sitting on a trainer's table 
on the USC sideline, his face etched in pain. 
</P>
<P>
End of film. End of collegiate career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just six plays into the game," Parkinson said. "It was a running play 
for Leroy Holt and I found my linebacker and got a good hit on him. Then the 
pile formed and it was kind of a stalemate. Then someone fell on my foot, 
someone else fell against my leg and I felt my right knee collapse inward. And 
I heard something pop." 
</P>
<P>
The injury was diagnosed as a ligament strain. It required no surgery and 
doctors say Parkinson could be back at full strength in six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, doesn't ease the burning disappointment the former Canyon High 
standout feels these days as he hobbles about the USC campus, his injured knee 
strapped into a heavy metal brace as his mind dances back to a Rose Bowl game 
that was supposed to be a final showcase for his skills, a game his team won 
over Michigan, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
And the favorable prognosis doesn't do much to ease Parkinson's worries about 
his future, either. 
</P>
<P>
Six to eight weeks is not when he needs his knee back. He needs it back at the 
end of this month, when he and hundreds of other college players gather at the 
invitation-only NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis, where many futures will 
be decided. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, who was named to the All-Pacific 10 Conference team as a guard after 
a sterling senior season, got his invitation to the NFL prospects' camp Jan. 2, 
the day after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first piece of mail I opened," he said. "I just thought to myself, 
'Oh, terrific. I'll still go and take the written tests and maybe do some 
bench-press stuff. But I won't be able to run.' 
</P>
<P>
"I have plenty of films showing me in action against some of the best defensive 
linemen in the country. I have the films, and maybe I can get some NFL teams to 
look at them. But I don't know how much this injury will mean to them. I know 
it will make it harder for me to get a shot at the NFL, though." 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, it seems, has made a career of hardships. 
</P>
<P>
His current knee injury is neither his first nor his most severe. That dubious 
honor was given to a 1987 injury to his left knee that required surgery early 
in 1988 to repair the cruciate ligament. But with great dedication and 
countless painful hours in the gym, he came back from that injury to regain a 
starting job for the final five games of the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, early in 1989, when he was at full strength for the first time in a year, 
another bomb dropped. He was ruled academically ineligible at USC and had to 
miss spring practice as he took makeup courses at Cal State Northridge. 
Parkinson completed the classes, however, rejoined the team before the season 
and regained his starting position after the first game. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent has had a few opportunities to quit, but he's always come back," his 
father, Bill, said. "I expect he'll do it again this time." 
</P>
<P>
When Parkinson hobbled from the Rose Bowl field, his father came quickly from 
his seat and made his way to the sideline. There, father and son were captured 
by NBC cameras in a most emotional moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the TV film a few times," Bill Parkinson said, "and I can't describe 
the feeling it gives. Here's this 6-foot-6, 260-pound kid with his head on my 
shoulder. But no matter how big he might be, he will always be my little boy. 
And I know this kid's hopes and dreams better than anyone, and I know they 
include playing pro football one day. 
</P>
<P>
"At that moment in the Rose Bowl, as we sat there together, it seemed all those 
hopes and dreams were gone, and it was, well, there hasn't been a sadder moment 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
In the days since, however, with the diagnosis of a strained ligament that 
should heal with rest, the spirit of both Parkinsons has been lifted. And, 
according to USC Coach Larry Smith, the next chapter in the Parkinson story 
could be the best one of all. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent had an excellent career here," Smith said. "This year he really reached 
his potential, as evidenced by his making the All-Pac-10 team. I think his past 
success was clouded somewhat by the knee injury, but I really believe his best 
football is ahead of him. He will be a strong consideration in the NFL draft." 
</P>
<P>
Which is all Brent Parkinson has ever wanted. Just to be considered. Just to 
get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has been a dream for a long time," he said. "I came to USC because I 
knew I'd get to play against the best defensive people in the country. I did 
that, and I proved I can handle them. I know I can pull out of the line and get 
on my man. I've proved it to myself. Now I have to hope I've proved it to 
others." 
</P>
<P>
The results will be known late in April, when the NFL holds its draft. In the 
meantime, Parkinson will attend the scouting combine and try to convince NFL 
team officials that he deserves a chance. He will bring reels of game film and 
a load of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And both he and his father hope that over the next few months, the scarred 
memories of a Rose Bowl gone wrong will fade. 
</P>
<P>
But they might linger a bit longer for Bill Parkinson than they do for his son. 
</P>
<P>
"Your own hopes and dreams go with your children," he said. "Brent had such a 
great feeling going into that game and then, in an instant, they seemed to 
vanish. 
</P>
<P>
"The sadness I felt for him that day is still with me. But I think I'll get 
over this. And I think Brent will overcome this obstacle too."

SCORING OFF THE BOARD;

<P>
BASKETBALL: MATIJASEVIC DITCHES SKATEBOARD TO BECOME A CRESCENTA VALLEY FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silly Paul Matijasevic. For a moment, he expected a modicum of praise from 
Crescenta Valley High Coach John Goffredo for his performance in a recent 
victory over Burbank. Instead, awaiting Matijasevic in the locker room was a 
mortar blast of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency was the problem. At times, Matijasevic would hustle. At other 
times, he would loaf. Some players run with the speed of a deer; Matijasevic 
posted up with the timidity of one. 
</P>
<P>
A quick check of the scorebook silenced Goffredo. Matijasevic had scored 20 
points and grabbed 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some pretty high expectations," Goffredo said. "Most coaches would have 
patted him on the back and said, 'You're wonderful.' I was on his butt." 
</P>
<P>
For good reason. Goffredo has held a flame to the 6-foot-7 senior before, and 
the results have been remarkable. Matijasevic's turnaround in the past three 
years has been more impressive than a 360-degree dunk. He changed from an 
aimless skateboard fanatic to one of the top high school frontcourt players in 
the Valley area. The transformation took place on the basketball court but the 
effects were felt in the classroom and in his personal life, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was not an immediate elixir. The discipline of practices frustrated 
Matijasevic during his first two seasons. He often considered quitting the 
team. Life was simple on a skateboard. There were no rules on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was quite a challenge because Paul wasn't quite ready to knuckle 
down with it," Paul's mother, Elizabeth, said. "I don't think he knew how much 
he would have to give of himself to basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Dividends began to trickle in when he made the varsity last season. The local 
press took notice of his play. He got attention on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a big difference," Elizabeth said. "He thought, 'Maybe it's worth all 
the time and effort I put into it.' Then, the skateboard was thrown aside." 
</P>
<P>
He often would go to school at 6 a.m. on school days to shoot on his own. He 
spent his spare time scouting games with Goffredo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I turned it around," Matijasevic said. "Coach just started 
helping me." 
</P>
<P>
And Matijasevic, who was gangly and awkward as a freshman, has flourished. He 
now averages 15 points and 10 rebounds a game, and he scored 28 points against 
Montebello. He was chosen the most valuable player of the Saugus tournament and 
named to the All-Crescenta Valley tournament team. In a showdown last month 
with North Hollywood's Dana Jones, Matijasevic outscored the Pepperdine-bound 
center, 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
"He's great near the basket," Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said of Matijasevic. 
"A very good inside player. He's got a real good touch in there and he jumps 
real well too." 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic, once resistant to authority, has come to terms with occasional 
lambastings from Goffredo. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're doing something wrong, he gets on you a lot and that sort of makes 
me mad," Matijasevic said. "But that's just him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've got my act together." 
</P>
<P>
Had it not come together, Matijasevic might have been sprawled across some La 
Crescenta street. Although he has forsaken his skateboard, he used to ride for 
hours every day. His favorite game was to lie on his board in a position aptly 
dubbed "the coffin" and plummet feet first down the steepest, most toe-tingling 
hill he could find. It was a sort of urban luge run. Friends drove alongside 
the then-6-foot-5 missile and, Matijasevic says, clocked him at more than 40 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the one-armed handstand. 
</P>
<P>
"The shorter kids could do it with ease," Matijasevic said. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't. As proof, a nasty, cigar-sized scar runs along the inside of his 
left elbow. While skateboarding during his freshman year, he attempted the move 
and fractured his arm in three places. He still has trouble fully extending the 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
The risky antics terrified his mother. "We tried everything with the 
skateboard," she said. "Confiscate it. Nothing worked. He and his skateboard 
always seemed to get together." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he and academia drifted briskly apart. Matijasevic's grades plunged 
more quickly than he did in "the coffin." His record of classroom offenses grew 
as long as his shaggy blond hair. He had a 1.1 grade-point average after his 
freshman year. It has since improved to 2.9. 
</P>
<P>
"I would come to school and teachers would say that Paul's done this or that -- 
disrupting the class," Elizabeth said. "He was very mischievous. I wouldn't say 
he was a bad kid." 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad kid, but an apathetic one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just disinterested in school," Crescenta Valley Principal Ken Biermann 
said. "Or just simply, if I have to (go to school), I have to." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Goffredo, who lives little more than a long jump shot from the 
Matijasevics. He had seen the lanky youngster skateboarding around the 
neighborhood. As a 6-foot-4 eighth-grader, Matijasevic was tough to miss. He 
was also a regular at the local video arcade owned by Norm Jones, the Falcons' 
freshman basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Goffredo approached him once but Matijasevic said that he would be attending 
St. Francis High and did not plan to play basketball. His grades were too low 
for St. Francis, however, and he wound up at Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The metamorphosis on the court has not been complete. 
</P>
<P>
"He loses focus," Goffredo said. "He'll put out and then he'll drift. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an emotional player and he has to stay emotional. If he's not, then he's 
not effective. You have to be intense. Nobody cares how tall you are." 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic plans to attend a junior college and would like to play eventually 
for Loyola Marymount. According to Goffredo, he would face long odds in making 
a Division I roster. 
</P>
<P>
About as long as the odds that basketball could change Matijasevic.

FISHING NOTES;

<P>
1989 HIGHLIGHTS: HALIBUT, SEA BASS, SAND BASS ABUNDANT IN LOCAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting on last year's sportfishing season for South Bay anglers: 
</P>
<P>
The spring run of halibut in Santa Monica Bay was good. 
</P>
<P>
White sea bass at the Deep Hole provided tackle-busting action. 
</P>
<P>
The reliable migratory sand bass returned to sandy beaches and limits on day 
and sundown trips were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Barracuda roamed a wide area and anglers had to be at the right spot at the 
right time. One day it was a wide-open bite at Rocky Point, the next it was 
Catalina Island action only. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow summer start, exotics made a strong showing in late July. Albacore 
were located 100 miles from Point Loma, averaging six to 10 pounds. South Bay 
boats chased the long fins on three-day trips. 
</P>
<P>
This changed in early August as bluefin and yellowfin tuna moved to within a 
one- or two-day trip for South Bay sportfishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned Aug. 19 with 581 tuna up to 
100 pounds, a possible record catch for a South Bay sportfisher. 
</P>
<P>
At Avalon, 1989 was the best year ever for marlin. Those weighed in shattered 
all previous records. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing outlook for this year is optimistic. The water is warmer and has 
sparked game-fish action. 
</P>
<P>
Bonito and yellowtail have been interested in baited hooks at Rocky Point and 
San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
An armada of shark fishermen in small boats has been covering an area from 
Santa Monica Beach to Malibu seeking great whites. 
</P>
<P>
It started with West Los Angeles shark fisherman Bill Barlow landing a 
170-pound white shark two weeks ago. Three have been caught since.

<P>
INCONSISTENT CS NORTHRIDGE FIGURES TO RATE HIGHLY -- AMONG ALSO-RANS; 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCE RACE: SAN LUIS OBISPO, BAKERSFIELD AND UC RIVERSIDE ARE CONSIDERED 
THE FAVORITES.

Cal State Northridge will not have to wait long to see how it fares against the 
top teams in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. The Matadors will open 
conference play on the road against a pair of highly regarded teams -- Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, at 8:05 tonight, and Cal State Bakersfield, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo (10-3), Bakersfield (12-1) and defending CCAA champion UC 
Riverside (10-3) are the tri-favorites in the conference race, while Northridge 
appears to be a leading member of the second echelon that includes Chapman and 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors (5-8) might have the talent to contend for the title. However, 
they have played inconsistently the past three weeks, losing three of five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Their victories have come at home against NAIA teams Biola (62-54) and the 
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (59-37), while their losses have 
been on the road against NCAA Division II teams UC Davis (69-68), Cal State 
Sacramento (71-65) and Division I Southern Utah State (94-79). 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a healthy and consistent ballclub, we can compete with any other 
team in the conference," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "It's just a 
matter of us playing consistently." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will not be at full strength for at least another week, when guard 
Eugene Humphrey hopes to return to the lineup. Humphrey has been sidelined for 
the past three games after suffering a severely bruised right hamstring against 
Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers, an All-CCAA second-team selection last season, leads the 
Matadors, who are 0-6 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers has team-high averages of 20.3 points and 8.8 rebounds a game and he 
ranks third and fifth in the CCAA in those categories. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo finished a game behind Northridge at 6-8 in the conference last 
season, but four starters return for the Mustangs, including All-CCAA forward 
Coby Naess (14.3 points) and guard James Gamma (11.8). 
</P>
<P>
Guard Stuart Thomas is averaging 14.2 points and a team-high 7.0 rebounds for 
the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, which tied for third in the CCAA last season at 9-5, is the 
hottest team in the conference, having won 11 games in a row after losing to 
San Francisco State, 68-64. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners are led by guard Wade Green and forwards Marvin Redeemer and 
Beau Redstone. 
</P>
<P>
Green is averaging 15.5 points, a conference-leading 7.1 assists and 2.5 steals 
a game, and Redeemer sports averages of 17.8 points and 7.2 rebounds. Redstone 
leads the team in rebounding with a 9.3 average and is fourth in scoring 
(11.2). 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside advanced to the semifinals of the Division II tournament last 
season and has four starters returning, including forward-center Chris Ceballos 
(18.4 ppg, 6.1 rpg). 
</P>
<P>
Also returning are three-point marksmen Mike Ritter (13.2 ppg) and Reggie 
Howard (12.2 ppg). Ritter has made 35 of 64 (54.7%) three-point shots, and 
Howard has hit 34 of 78 (43.6%) from beyond the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman (8-5) is led by sophomore forward-center Roger Middleton, the leading 
scorer (22.1) and No. 2 rebounder (10.9) in the conference. Guard Robert 
Barksdale (18.5 points, 5.2 assists) will power Dominguez Hills (4-9). 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L. A. was 0-14 in conference play last season, but the Golden Eagles 
(6-6) are vastly improved, led by forward-center LaVar Ball (16.9 points, 8.9 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Center Terry Ross is averaging 20.7 points and a CCAA-leading 12.7 rebounds a 
game for Cal Poly Pomona (6-7).

SDYC READY TO MAKE FINAL LEGAL MOVE IN AMERICA'S CUP FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within about two months, the two-year legal battle between the Mercury Bay 
Boating Club and the San Diego Yacht Club over the America's Cup will be 
history. And no one will be happier than Tom Ehman, executive vice president of 
the SDYC's Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick of the whole thing, and I think everybody else is, too," Ehman said 
Thursday at a press conference announcing that the SDYC had filed its final 
legal papers with the New York Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The SDYC's action is in response to an appeal filed in December by the New 
Zealand's MBBC. The Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments from both sides 
in Albany, N.Y., on Feb. 8. A final decision is expected in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
The MBBC, representing Michael Fay, has asked the state's highest court to 
overturn a September 1989 decision by the Appellate Division of the New York 
Supreme Court that said the SDYC's catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, was an 
eligible yacht when it won the America's Cup in a match race off San Diego a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said "I can hardly imagine losing this one," the sixth battle the SDYC 
and MBBC have waged in the courts dating back to September 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do lose, we'll probably take our lumps and get on with it," Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Latham &amp; Watkins attorney Mark Smith, who helps represent the SDYC, said 
the losing side at this level will have virtually no recourse. 
</P>
<P>
"The only remaining option is to ask the (seven) judges to reconsider, and that 
is rarely done," Smith said. "There is no basis for jurisdiction in any federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad it's finally over with. I hate what it's done to this event." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the 43-page brief, prepared mostly by Smith, "convincingly refutes 
every argument advanced by Mercury Bay Boating Club." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there has ever been a more detailed analysis of what the 
America's Cup is all about than in this brief," Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he did not directly respond to the MBBC's latest arguments in his 
brief, mainly because he didn't think they carried much weight. Smith also said 
he is not worried about the "friend of the court" brief filed in the MBBC's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Bay has gathered a number of other yachtsman and former America's Cup 
skippers, including Ted Turner, to support its argument that the SDYC should 
forfeit the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it really adds too much to the discourse before the court," 
Smith said. "(The MBBC) doesn't have any new arguments at all. It looks to me 
like it's taking a poll. It's a bunch of people coming in and saying that we 
prefer that New Zealand win. We could go out and get a bunch of people that 
say, 'We prefer San Diego win,' but we're not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said he is already making plans for SDYC to be host to America's Cup in 
May of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a record number of challenging nations and we have already agreed to 
the rules which would prevent this maverick challenge of the Mercury Bay Yacht 
Club, or something similar, from ever happening again."

Smoking Gun: David Goerlitz, a former top model for Winston cigarettes, has 
turned on the tobacco industry. He said his 3 1/2-pack-a-day smoking habit led 
to a stroke. "I was paid $2,500 a day . . . to make (smoking) look rugged and 
make it look successful . . . make it look wonderful," the 40-year-old Goerlitz 
said Wednesday. "All these ads are nothing more than mere lies." Goerlitz spoke 
at an Albany, N.Y., public forum on New York State's new smoking law, which 
prohibits smoking in many public places. Goerlitz said the stroke has taken 
away feeling in the left side of his face and has robbed him of his ability to 
taste food.

Food for Peace: Jihan Sadat, widow of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, 
journeyed to Omaha this week to help raise money for the Center for Human 
Nutrition at the University of Nebraska and to talk on "Women and World Peace." 
According to a spokeswoman, Sadat's appearance at a luncheon and a dinner 
grossed about $75,000 for the center.

Review on the Run: Novelist Salman Rushdie, in hiding from Muslim extremists 
who have vowed to kill him, has written a book review praising a novelist famed 
for being reclusive. Rushdie's review for next Sunday's New York Times praises 
"Vineland" by Thomas Pynchon, a writer who refuses interviews and photographs. 
In the review, which he has written in a California-slang style much like that 
used by Pynchon, Rushdie says: "So he wants a private life and no photographs 
and nobody to know his home address. I can dig it, I can relate to that (but 
like, he should try it when it's compulsory instead of a free-choice option)."

Quayle Baiting: Just how smart is Dan Quayle? A new book, "Scandal Annual 1990 
-- Who Got Caught Doing What in 1989," a compendium of last year's silly 
wrongdoings, includes a chapter titled "How Dumb is Danny?" The book says 
determining Quayle's intellectual ability is a matter of national security and 
that the question could be settled by having the Vice President be a contestant 
on "Jeopardy." YEMI TOURE

SOME THOUGHTS ON UNTRASHING L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "The Waste Queen" (Dec. 29): As a working mother with six children, my days 
are very busy without sorting out my trash. Even though I am well aware that we 
are overflowing our landfills, I can only do so much. 
</P>
<P>
I feel people like myself are more the rule than the exception. Who has time to 
bundle newspapers, take bottles and cans to recycling centers, tie tree 
branches? Who wants to have trash accumulating in their homes? I'm always 
afraid the cockroaches will find the aluminum cans before they are taken to the 
ultimate destination. 
</P>
<P>
After reading "The Waste Queen," I asked myself what would it take for me to 
get behind Joan Edwards refuse plan? 
</P>
<P>
This was what I came up with: Get together with a large trash-container 
manufacturer, and have them agree to manufacture color-coded, 30-gallon trash 
containers. Then have the Department of Waste Management distribute a 
color-coded chart of what items are recycleable and which color trash bin to 
use when disposing of such items. Try to put this chart on something that won't 
get thrown away, and make sure everyone gets one. If we could simply throw 
these items into the appropriate waste can and be assured that in the near 
future pick-up will be provided, we can all help with little effort.

SOME THOUGHTS ON UNTRASHING L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed the article regarding the highly respected waste organizer, Joan 
Edwards, hired by L.A. City to reduce the voluminous mountains of trash 
currently dumped into the landfills. 
</P>
<P>
I hope she is able to bring about discipline to our disposable society. 
</P>
<P>
I also hope she can bring about some change in the bottled drink industry. It 
bothers me that only the beer and soda companies have a deposit/return system 
to encourage recycling, while the juice industry, with those heavy, valuable 
glass bottles, offers no incentive at all. 
</P>
<P>
I support Joan Edwards' ideals and trust that her office will remain free of 
special interests.

White Girls by Lynn Lauber (Norton: $17.95; 187 pp) 
</P>
<P>
If you had the luck (good or bad, depending on your point of view) to grow up 
in a town with a single family-owned department store, a couple of drive-ins 
and maybe -- like Union, Ohio -- an exotic dining spot that offered Chinese 
pressed duck; if there was a "right" side and a "wrong" side of the tracks, 
then you won't care if "White Girls" is a novel or a collection of vignettes. 
You'll be back there in the boondocks with the narrator of this beguiling book, 
dreaming of escape, determined to avoid reliving your mother's life, becoming a 
teen-age expert in deceit and deception. 
</P>
<P>
Divided, like the town itself, into halves, "White Girls" begins with a first 
person account of Loretta Dardio's immediate neighborhood, Rosewood Avenue. 
She's still in grade school, at Marcus Aurelius, where "the ceilings were low, 
and the floors made so slick by the black janitor, Mr. Jefferson, that visitors 
from the PTA often slipped and fell on their tail bones when they came inside." 
Lauber doesn't have to tell you that Marcus Aurelius was hastily built of 
cinder block and acoustical tile in time to receive the surprise crop of baby 
boomers. You'll know the corridors of that school, just the way you'll 
recognize the author's mother, who changed "that year we moved to Rosewood, 
when she saw that my brother and I were all she would accomplish in life." 
</P>
<P>
Union, Ohio, was just large enough to have its own TV station; the hours from 
11 to 2 were filled by Coral Baker's talk show, watched "mostly by shut-ins or 
ironing mothers," the celebrity guests the chairman of the March of Dimes, the 
secretary of the Parks Department and that day's birthday child. In Union, you 
didn't get television from Burbank on your 9-inch screen, although there was a 
Goodwill and a Men's Mission competing for the limited amount of castoffs, and 
curiously, a permanent population of vagrants and prostitutes, who functioned 
as a "warning to the girls of Union that if they couldn't type fifty words per 
minute, or bear clerking at Woolworth's candy counter (next to the bird 
department, so that the ju-jus and chocolate-covered peanuts tasted of molt), 
or find a mild husband to prop themselves up, this might also be their lot." At 
this point in her life, Loretta is still an observer, commenting precociously 
on the ladies' bowling team, Gregg's Department Store, summer vacation at the 
lake and the agonies of Dardio family reunions. 
</P>
<P>
By Part II, she's in high school and even more spirited and defiant. Having 
served her apprenticeship as a spectator at life's smorgasbord, she's 
desperately eager to sample some of the more exotic delicacies. With teased 
hair and kohl-rimmed eyes, she manages to attract the interest of Luther Biggs, 
one of Union High's few black students. The number of whispered late-night 
telephone conversations finally arouses her abstracted mother's suspicions, and 
Loretta finds herself in the office of Dr. Erwin, surely the town's only 
psychologist, who cautions her firmly against becoming involved with someone in 
Luther's "cultural milieu." Up to this point, "White Girls" is a delightful 
diversion, but the tone darkens almost at once. Dr. Erwin's mincing euphemism 
is a goad, and Loretta dives headfirst into Luther's world. 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar Street," the second half of the book, describes her total immersion into 
a thrilling and perilous emotional adventure, involved not only with Luther 
himself, but with his generous and capable mother, Annie, his skeptical sister, 
Nettie, and the other members of Union's black community. Infatuation deprives 
Loretta of the detachment that lent the first half of the book its tart charm, 
replacing her innocence with premature wisdom: Even in Union, Ohio, where the 
gulf separating Rosewood Avenue from Sugar Street seems relatively narrow, one 
crosses the division at considerable personal risk; Loretta gambles and loses. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this taut and affecting memoir, Loretta has taken a giant step 
away from her mother's drab and disappointing life, but not quite in the 
direction she would have chosen had she been less desperate to get away, had 
she been patient for a year or two longer. Honest, wry and rueful, "White 
Girls" is the coming-of-age novel with a vengeance.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: ARGUMENT FOR A COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Why is it that when my husband and I argue, we never reach a 
solution? I don't think this is my fault because I'm always willing to continue 
the discussion and search for a compromise, while my husband wants to 
discontinue the discussion or pretend there's really no problem. One result is 
that I'm frustrated because nothing changes. -- V.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR V.C.: Men and women generally have different goals when there are 
disagreements. According to Dr. John Gottman, a psychologist at the University 
of Illinois, men tend to want to avoid conflicts in marriage, while women are 
more willing to confront them. 
</P>
<P>
The wife wants to resolve the argument so she feels closer to her husband and 
respected by him, but his main concern is avoiding a blowup. The husband, Dr. 
Gottman says, doesn't see the disagreement as an opportunity for closeness, but 
for trouble. He believes one of the reasons is because men are more vulnerable 
than women to physical stress from emotional confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that when arguments are never settled or resolved in a positive 
way, the differences remain and eat away at the relationship. Resentments 
build, and eventually this interferes with the quality of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm married to a brilliant and successful engineer, but his 
lack of understanding of me and his two children sometimes amazes me. I know in 
my heart that he loves us, but he's demanding. At times, all of us rebel and 
want to clobber him. He refuses to get any counseling and seems to think the 
difficulties and problems are all directly due to our defects. -- S.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.B.: Analysts who work in communities where there are many engineers and 
high-tech workers often comment on the great power of precision of those 
workers, and on their lack of persuasion and inability to express feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers tend to be perfectionists and, according to psychologist Judah 
Landes, this often causes family conflict. Obviously, this doesn't mean all 
engineers are difficult and uncommunicative, but Landes points out that those 
who suffer from what she calls the Lockheed Syndrome usually try to avoid 
conflict by turning to hobbies, hiding behind stereo headphones or escaping by 
sitting for hours in front of a TV set. 
</P>
<P>
Very often, scientists and engineers are happy being by themselves, doing 
something they have control over. Since they have little control at home, they 
may feel deep frustration, which they are unable to express. You can help your 
husband by urging him to share his feelings. There's no reason he can't be less 
of a perfectionist at home.

THE GRAMMYS, ROUND 1;

<P>
POP MUSIC: ROCK 'N' ROLL VETERANS LEAD PACK OF RECORDING INDUSTRY AWARDS 
NOMINEES.

Los Angeles-based rock veterans Don Henley, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt and the 
Traveling Wilburys will compete with English soul band the Fine Young Cannibals 
in the album of the year category in the 32nd annual Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The nominations were announced Thursday at a Beverly Hills press conference. 
Winners will be named in nationally televised ceremonies from the Shrine 
Auditorium on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The album field consists of ex-Eagle Henley's sardonic "The End of the 
Innocence," rocker Petty's darkly humorous "Full Moon Fever," blueswoman 
Raitt's reflective "Nick of Time," the informal "supergroup" the Traveling 
Wilburys' good-natured "Volume One" and the Cannibals' soul-flavored "The Raw 
&amp; the Cooked." 
</P>
<P>
Henley, with his album's title track, and the Cannibals, with "She Drives Me 
Crazy," were also named in the record of the year category, along with Billy 
Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" Mike + the Mechanics' "The Living Years" and 
Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's "Innocence" was also named in the song and male rock vocal categories, 
giving him four nominations. Other artists with four nominations are Petty, 
Prince, Raitt, Dave Grusin and Mike + the Mechanics' Mike Rutherford. Triple 
nominees are five-time winner Joel, Fine Young Cannibals, Midler, Soul II Soul, 
Janet Jackson, Bruce Hornsby, Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, BeBe Winans and 
James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
While nominations in the two top categories generally followed industry 
predictions, there were some surprising absences, most notably Richard Marx, 
whose "Repeat Offender" album was one of 1989's biggest sellers and featured 
many mainstream textures often favored by Grammy voters. Others who had been 
widely touted for either album or single nominations included the Rolling 
Stones, Janet Jackson, Neneh Cherry and Paula Abdul. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting is conducted among the 6,000 members of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences. The eligibility period for the 32nd annual 
competition ran from Oct. 1, 1988 to Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The competitors for best song (a songwriter's award) are Henley and Bruce 
Hornsby ("The End of the Innocence"), Rutherford and Brian Robertson ("The 
Living Years"), Joel ("We Didn't Start the Fire"), Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar 
("Wind Beneath My Wings") and the trio of Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Tom Snow 
("Don't Know Much"). 
</P>
<P>
Competing against Soul II Soul (which had two other nominations) in the 
new-artist category are Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Milli Vanilli and Tone Loc. 
</P>
<P>
In other key categories, Joel and Prince are up against Michael Bolton, Richard 
Marx and Roy Orbison for male pop vocal, while Raitt and Midler will be 
challenged by Linda Ronstadt, Gloria Estefan and Paula Abdul for female pop 
vocal honors. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists in the female rock vocal competition, along with Raitt, are 
Melissa Etheridge, Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper and Pat Benatar. Vying with Henley 
for the male rock vocal award are Petty, Neil Young, Lou Reed and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
In the rock group vocal category, U2 is nominated twice -- for the album 
"Rattle and Hum" and for the single "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration 
with B. B. King. The group's challengers are the Rolling Stones, the Traveling 
Wilburys and Living Colour. 
</P>
<P>
The female R&amp;B vocal nominees are Vanessa Williams, Anita Baker, Natalie 
Cole, Janet Jackson and Aretha Franklin, while the contenders for the R&amp;B 
male vocal award are Prince, Bobby Brown, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross and 
Smokey Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists for best rap performance are Young MC, Public Enemy, Tone Loc, D. 
J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince and De La Soul. 
</P>
<P>
In country, k.d. lang and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band both received two 
nominations, lang for best country vocal and as co-writer of "Luck in My Eyes," 
and Dirt Band for best group vocal and vocal collaboration. Lang's competitors 
for female country vocal honors are Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, Dolly Parton 
and Kathy Mattea. The challengers for the male country vocal award are Rodney 
Crowell, Keith Whitley, Randy Travis, Clint Black and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeter Miles Davis is the leading nominee in jazz genre with three -- for 
jazz fusion, solo jazz and big-band jazz performances. In the solo jazz 
category, he'll be vying with Andre Previn, John Patitucci, Wynton Marsalis and 
Chick Corea. For the jazz group instrumental award, it's brother against 
brother -- Wynton vs. Branford Marsalis. Previn, for his "After Hours" album 
was also nominated in this category, along with the Yellowjackets and the Chick

Both repertory and performers in the classical album category are more offbeat 
than usual, though sentimental voting might favor a valedictory award to 
Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Symphony for their Bruckner Eighth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees also include the Gerard Schwarz/Seattle Symphony disc of Howard 
Hanson symphonies and the Emerson Quartet's Bartok set (both up in two other 
categories as well), and the Christoph von Dohnanyi/Garrick Ohlsson/Cleveland 
Orchestra version of Busoni's Piano Concerto and the James Levine/Metropolitan 
Opera recording of "Die Walkure," each with one other nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The Robert Shaw Grammy machine in Atlanta has a recording of Britten's "War 
Requiem" on the ticket in two categories.

U.S. PAVILION AT EXPO '92 A VICTIM OF FEDERAL BUDGET CUT; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: L.A. ARCHITECT IS 'APPALLED' THAT THE NATION WON'T BE AT SPAIN'S FAIR 
MARKING AMERICA'S DISCOVERY.

<P>
Expo '92, the major world's fair planned for Seville, Spain, will celebrate the 
500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America -- and it looks like the 
United States of America will not be represented. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the $30-million Seville U.S. pavilion, designed by a Los Angeles team 
led by architects Barton Myers Associates, has been cut from the federal 
budget. The bill that created funding for the pavilion was eliminated from the 
1990 federal appropriations measure recently passed by both houses of Congress 
and signed into law by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The pavilion's funding is a victim of the struggle to balance the federal 
budget. Rep. Neil Smith (D-Iowa), chairman of a House subcommittee that 
oversees the U.S. Information Agency, declared that Seville "is a low priority 
for taxpayers' money at a time when lawmakers are trying to reduce the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Barton Myers said he is "frankly appalled" at the government's 
failure to fund the project. Myers' design, which won a national architectural 
competition and has been widely praised by critics across the country, has now 
missed the ground-breaking deadline set for this spring on the Expo '92 site, 
an island in the Guadalquivir River. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret that the U.S., alone among the world's major nations, may well 
fail to be represented at Seville, in a fair that highlights the Age of 
Discovery," Myers said. "This is despite the fact that President Reagan wrote 
personally to King Juan Carlos promising that the U.S. would most certainly be 
present in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
About 110 countries have committed to build pavilions at the fair site. Among 
the nations that will not be represented are South Africa, Albania, Iraq, Syria 
and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' design for the Seville U.S. pavilion imaginatively develops the fair's 
theme of discovery. Passing through an entry under a wall of water, visitors 
cross a bridge over an "ocean," which symbolizes Columbus' voyages to the New 
World. Inside the pavilion three high-tech, sun-tracking "shade sails" invoke 
images of Columbus' vessels: the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty pylons, representing the states, double as cooling towers that draw hot, 
dry air through a layer of moistened pads. This energy-saving device avoids the 
need for air conditioning in the Andalusian summer and demonstrates American 
ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
If the pavilion is to be built after all, it will either require a special 
federal appropriation or its backers will have to seek private-sector funding, 
Myers said. Even if the private sector can be persuaded to fund the pavilion, 
whose construction would have to be rushed, Myers questioned whether the United 
States should be represented at this major international fair by private 
interests rather than a government agency.

USIA officials in Washington declined to comment on the pavilion situation. 
Agency spokesman Frank Johnson said it is "hopeful" that funding will be found 
in time for a fall start on construction.

Peter L. Spurney, a Washington fair-management specialist involved with Expo 
'92, said, "Seville will reflect what's going on in Europe in 1992. Like it or 
not, it's going to be the place to be." 
</P>
<P>
But not, it seems, for the United States. As Heller remarked, "the U.S. effort 
in Seville is so far dead in the water."

'TORVILL &amp; DEAN': ANOTHER THAW IN COLD WAR; 
</P>
<P>
ICE-SKATING: BRITISH COUPLE JOIN FORCES WITH A MOSCOW-BASED COMPANY IN THEIR 
SHOW AT UNIVERSAL AMPHITHEATRE.

<P>
It's multinational politics on ice as British ice skaters Jayne Torvill and 
Christopher Dean perform "Torvill &amp; Dean and the Russian Allstars" at the 
Universal Amphitheatre through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of Torvill and Dean's unconventional programming is their solo number 
called "Missing," which Dean described as "the oppression of those who are 
missing, who just disappeared without a trace, and of the people -- brothers, 
sisters, husbands, wives, others -- who are looking for them, who have no 
redress and just have to accept that their loved ones are missing." 
</P>
<P>
"We see images in front of us, of people disappearing, and we're shocked by 
them," Torvill, 32, added. "They're images of desperation." 
</P>
<P>
At opening night Tuesday, the political number got a big hand from the 
audience, which filled about two-thirds of the Amphitheatre. In the two-hour 
production, the couple also perform six other solo numbers -- including 
"Bolero," which won them a string of perfect scores at the 1984 Winter Olympics 
at Sarajevo and got a standing ovation, the vaudeville-influenced "Hatrick" in 
which they pass derbies back and forth over most of their bodies, and an 
Astaire/Rogers duet. They also join forces with 20 members of a Moscow-based 
company of Soviet skating champions called the Russian Allstars, and give the 
Soviets, led by former European champion Yuri Ovchinikov, the spotlight for 
selections ranging from Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances" to a Phil Collins medley. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographed primarily by Dean and renowned Soviet coach Tatyana Tarasova -- 
who created the Allstars company in 1983 with Ovchinikov -- the show premiered 
in Moscow in August, 1988. The ensemble then spent six months touring Australia 
and New Zealand and another three in England, and is now in the last two weeks 
of a four-month, 60-city North American tour presented by Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laurel Plaza Ice Capades Chalet in North Hollywood, where the ensemble 
was rehearsing last week, Dean, 31, said: "The producers thought it was good 
because of the climate of glasnost, and the easing of the Cold War, which no 
longer exists. So you could view the show on a number of fronts." 
</P>
<P>
The appellation "The Russian Allstars," incidentally, was not adopted for easy 
identification with non-Soviet audiences. "That's the translation of their 
company name," Torvill said. "We wanted them to change it -- we said, 'In the 
Western world, that sounds like a football team.' But that's the way they're 
known in their country, and they were adamant." 
</P>
<P>
The working relationship between the two factions proceeded more smoothly, the 
dancers said, though there were inevitable adjustments. "They were surprised at 
how long we rehearse, and I think it took them a little while to get used to 
our system of working and the way Chris wanted things done as the 
choreographer," Torvill noted. "They weren't used to working in groups of five 
and six." 
</P>
<P>
There were also stylistic differences with which to contend. "It was hard for a 
little while to soften them out, make their skating smoother," Dean recalled. 
"We were trying to capture the essence of something, as opposed to the 
technical feat -- we had to spend a lot of time on detail. For the finale (a 
Hollywood tribute set to music by Gershwin and Berlin), the feeling we wanted 
was of very relaxed movements, and that was also foreign to them: They didn't 
know who Fred Astaire was. But eventually we showed them videotapes, and they 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
As for choreographer Tarasova, Dean said wryly, "We've had our ups and downs. 
It's quite healthy to have a few clashes. At the end of the day, we're all 
aiming for the same thing, a good show." 
</P>
<P>
Tarasova on this day was sidelined by a massive toothache, but colleague 
Ovchinikov, 39, who doubles as the Allstars' director and lead skater, said 
through an interpreter that the two choreographers "had found a common 
language. (The Allstars) have gotten a lot of interesting work from Jayne and 
Chris, because they are very interesting skaters and professionals on a high 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of the tour, the company has drawn closer personally as well as 
professionally, Torvill and Dean said. "The kids have begun to trust us more -- 
they'd been brought up in a society where no one trusts anyone, least of all a 
foreigner," Torvill observed. "We can sit down and talk to them about political 
things -- our country, their country. They're pretty open about things. They're 
as interested in what's happening in the world now as we are. They're excited 
about (the dramatic events of the past few weeks), find them positive steps."

BOND'S FINANCIAL EMPIRE TEETERS ON BRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, who captured the America's Cup seven years 
ago, is fighting to prevent the collapse of his financially troubled brewing 
and media empire, which is more than $5 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bond empire collapses, it would be the biggest failure in Australian 
corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
As creditors demand that the company make delinquent payments, Bond Corp. 
Holdings Ltd., is waging a legal battle to unseat a court-appointed receiver 
and manager of its Australian brewing operations. The cash strapped Bond Corp. 
is Australia's second-largest beer maker. It moved into the U.S. beer market 
three years ago and has interests in G. Heileman Brewing Co. and Pittsburgh 
Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Losing control of the brewing interests is the company's most worrisome problem 
because it could trigger the default of other existing loans and cause other 
creditors to protect their loans. That, in turn, could bring the house of Bond 
down, according to company officials. Already, a group of U.S. investors, who 
recently failed to receive a $32 million interest payment from Bond Corp., is 
demanding immediate repayment of a $510 million in debentures issued by the 
Australian brewery.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: IS THERE A FUTURE IN DEAD-END PUBLISHING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Psssst. Wanna buy a book with profiles of 12 condemned killers, a history of 
capital punishment, and a complete listing of the nation's Death Row inmates? 
</P>
<P>
If so, call Hare Productions in Carlsbad. They've got 13,000 copies in the 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
It's called "Death Row" ($19.95, 225 pages, fully illustrated). It's the latest 
creation of Glenn Hare, 58, a former San Diego cop turned magazine publisher 
and emergency gear manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"We started working on it at about the time of the Ted Bundy execution," Hare 
said. "I realized there is a public fascination and curiosity about capital 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Hare was on the San Diego force from 1962 to 1966. He left to start a company 
making traction splints; his Dyna Corp. now manufactures 100 paramedic-style 
items (cots, gurneys, extraction devices, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
From that, he went into publishing. Hare Productions publishes Police magazine 
(circulation 55,000) and Emergency magazine (35,000) and does the printing for 
a dozen more magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Hare sold 2,000 copies of "Death Row" through an ad in Police. He hopes to sell 
the remaining 13,000 through bookstores and ads on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see an update every three months, telling about new arrivals on Death 
Row, who's been cleared, and who's finally been executed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hare is pro-death penalty. But "Death Penalty" is not a tirade against liberal 
judges and the ACLU. The prose is straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Casey, an assistant to San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, wrote the 
overview chapter and a profile of Robert Alton Harris, who murdered two Mira 
Mesa teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
As a cop, Hare took part in one of San Diego's most celebrated shoot-outs: a 
four-hour downtown gun battle in 1965 with the killer of a jewelry store 
manager. Robert Anderson was captured and sentenced to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the state Supreme Court used Anderson's case to rule the death penalty 
unconstitutional. He was paroled in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"He's walking the streets of Seattle these days," Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flimsy Jail Humor 
</P>
<P>
It's all true. 
</P>
<P>
* The flight of inmates from the county's flimsy facility in East County has 
bred its own humor. Fleeing prisoners are said to have issued themselves a writ 
of habeas escapus. 
</P>
<P>
When Supervisor Susan Golding received a crystal bowl from her colleagues this 
week in appreciation of her year as chairwoman, she found the box packed with 
tiny curlicues of Styrofoam. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she figured the fluffy stuff was building materials from the El 
Cajon Jail. 
</P>
<P>
* Golfers, Replace your Mantras! 
</P>
<P>
MiraCosta College of Oceanside is offering a course in "Zen and the Golf 
Swing." Golfers will be taught the posture exercises and breathing techniques 
of Zen. 
</P>
<P>
* Patricia Shaffer, professor of chemistry at the University of San Diego, has 
received a $200,000 grant to study genes in connection with leukemia and 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
It's not your usual grant: It's the largest grant ever received by a USD 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Shaffer is not your usual professor: She's a Sacred Heart nun (Rome 
'57) as well as a Ph.D in chemistry (UC San Diego, '75). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He's No Padres Fan 
</P>
<P>
It started with a joking headline on Times sports editor Dave Distel's column 
on Thursday: "Have a Credit Card Ready and Call Now! 1-800-BUY-PADRES." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cole, co-owner of Emslee Products of Cleveland, Ohio, is not laughing. 
His company sells sanitary napkins. Its number is 1-800-BUY PADS. 
</P>
<P>
"Our phone has been ringing all day," Cole said. "My secretary can't get any 
work done, I'm losing orders, I'm paying 12-cents per minute for every call, 
what in hell are you people doing out there?" 
</P>
<P>
Cole hopes people will stop phoning. He spent an exasperating day telling 
callers he's not related to Joan Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'Listen, I can't sell you a baseball team, but if you need 
sanitary napkins, toilet seat covers or diapers, I'm your man,' " Cole said. "I 
didn't make a single sale!"

'RECYCLED' GLASS WINDING UP AT LANDFILLS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: COLLECTORS SAY GLASS COMPANIES ARE REFUSING THEIR LOADS TO PROTEST 
THE HIGH PRICE OF SCRAP. THE INDUSTRY SAYS THE REAL PROBLEM IS CONTAMINANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tons and tons of glass collected and sorted for recycling is instead ending up 
in landfills, recyclers and manufacturers agreed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, they disagreed on why the glass is being thrown out with the trash. 
Recyclers say the glass companies don't want to pay the state-fixed rate. Glass 
companies say the recyclers are offering contaminated goods. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the Miramar Landfill, six glass recyclers from San 
Diego and Orange counties claimed that California glass companies are chafing 
under a state-imposed price that is nearly twice as high as the cost of raw 
materials. As a result, they said, at least two Los Angeles area glass 
companies have begun rejecting recyclers' loads without good cause, in order to 
send a message to the state. 
</P>
<P>
A glass industry spokesman acknowledged that the companies believe the price of 
scrap glass is too high, at nearly $94 a ton, but he said they are rejecting 
only about 5% of what they receive -- about the same percentage rejected before 
the state implemented the California Recycling Law in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
If Southern California recyclers are being turned away it is because they have 
done poor work, the industry contends. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (one San Diego recycler), 'You've got to find a way to get the 
contaminants out of your glass,' " said Lee Wiegand, president of California 
Glass Recycling Corp., a nonprofit coalition that represents the state's glass 
industry. "The percentage of rejections has not gone up. The glass industry has 
been doing its level best to provide a market." 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Conservation, that market is not big 
enough. Ralph Chandler, the chief of the department's recycling division, sent 
a letter to all certified recyclers acknowledging the "problems arising from 
the recycling of glass" and outlining how recyclers who dump glass into 
landfills could be reimbursed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to recent rejections of glass by end-users in the California market and 
temporary glass-plant closures, certified recyclers are unable to market glass 
redeemed at their sites," says the letter, dated Dec. 21. "While the Division 
does not advocate, and has never advocated nor encouraged, the disposal of any 
beverage container material type, it is apparent that the only recourse for 
processors (middlemen) to continue to accept glass from recyclers is if they, 
in turn, are able to dispose of the glass in accordance with current 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The letter included a copy of a "Notice to Dispose" form that would allow the 
recyclers to be reimbursed for what they paid out to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Local recyclers, disappointed by the letter, believe the public will be 
unsympathetic when it discovers it wasted its time separating bottles from 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
For six years, said Brooke A. Nash, executive director of Solana Recyclers 
Inc., her Solana Beach company took tons of used glass to market and never had 
a single load rejected by the glass industry. In October, she said, something 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"In three months, we had three loads rejected for 'contaminants,' " Nash said, 
quoting the term glass manufacturers use to describe ceramics or other 
non-meltable products mixed in with the glass. "It's a recycler's nightmare. 
We've been working for years to build community support -- the last thing in 
the world we want to do is say, 'We can't take your glass anymore.' But we 
can't sell it." 
</P>
<P>
The result was visible Thursday from the top of a man-made mountain of trash at 
Miramar Landfill. Far below, two trucks dumped more than 20 tons of "recycled" 
glass onto the ground. Then, with a crunch audible from 100 yards away, a 
bulldozer crushed the bottles and pushed them into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
Coy Smith, head of San Diego Recycling, sighed and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally sell that glass to make money to cover the cost to pick it up," he 
said. "Now we are paying to dump it here, and it is taking up space in this 
landfill. It's a double loss." 
</P>
<P>
Wiegand said his industry is proud of its track record. Before 1987, he said, 
the glass industry collected about 100,000 tons of used glass a year. Now it 
collects about 400,000 tons, rejecting about 20,000 of that. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego recyclers claim that in recent months, more loads than usual have 
been rejected by the Owens Brockway Glass Container Division, a division of 
Owens Illinois in Vernon, and by So Cal Glass Beneficiation in Huntington Park, 
two of the major glass purchasers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Recycling reported that, since August, 25% of its loads have been 
rejected. Before August, not one load had been turned down, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to landfill 30 tons to date," Smith said. "If you ask the glass 
industry, they say we are producing sloppy loads of glass. But we're not doing 
anything different." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Pepper, operations manager at IMS Recycling Services, the largest glass 
collector in San Diego, said her company has 1 million pounds of glass it can't 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, recyclers said, is that both Owens Brockway and So Cal 
have recently shut for brief periods, turning away all vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"So Cal was closed over Christmas for two weeks," said Nick Candela, vice 
president of the Recycling Division of CR&amp;R Inc., based in Stanton. "Owens 
Brockway closed their doors Tuesday, claiming they're full." 
</P>
<P>
Candela said he has 300 tons of glass in storage that has been rejected by the 
industry, which he believes is "forcing the issue" by refusing to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones, president of So Cal, acknowledged that the state-mandated price of 
scrap glass "creates a disincentive for glass companies to buy the material 
back. If the prices were competitive with raw material prices, more would be 
used." 
</P>
<P>
But he said any rejections are made strictly on the quality of the glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, the glass has always been poor from most recyclers," he said. 
"We try to give them the benefit of the doubt, because we're 100% behind 
recycling. But you have recyclers believing they are protected by the law and 
expecting us to take the loads no matter what they've got. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just my opinion that a lot of the glass generated in San Diego has had 
quality problems wherever they've gone. That's what I hear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Bailey, head of the Owens Brockway recycling center, did not return phone 
calls Thursday.

RESEARCHERS SAY NEW S.D. CANCER DATA WILL PROVIDE 'A LEAP AHEAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans develop cancers at rates comparable to elsewhere in the United 
States, according to local researchers who are monitoring new cancer cases 
reported to health officials. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer incidence rates were tabulated by the San Diego and Imperial 
Organization for Cancer Control, a state-funded organization that began 
collecting cancer data in California's two southernmost counties Jan. 1, 1988. 
The state-funded cancer registry is one of 10 systems being formed to track 
cancer statewide, said UC San Diego pathology professor Sidney L. Saltzstein, 
the organizations's director. 
</P>
<P>
Data released during a Thursday press conference provided a "snapshot" of the 
types and incidence of cancer among San Diegans during 1988, Saltzstein said. 
The types and numbers of cancers reported during 1988 were "well within the 
realm of the usual numbers" generated by previous surveys elsewhere in the 
country, Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
According to SANDIOCC's preliminary data, 6,361 new cases of cancer were 
reported in San Diego during 1988, and 189 cases were reported in Imperial 
County. A complete report will be issued in about four months, Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the registry, the leading types of cancers reported in San Diego 
County in 1988 were genital, 1,475 cases; digestive-tract, 1,222; breast, 
1,051, and lung, 966. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study's first-year results will help researchers learn more about 
cancer in San Diego, the "true value" of the registry will become evident with 
"the accumulation of data over many years," Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with data from several years, researchers will be better equipped to 
determine whether suspected cancer clusters are linked to environmental causes, 
Saltzstein said. Researchers now must rely on incidental data that often is 
incomplete, Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers will also use the new registry to try to better understand why 
various populations are more susceptible to certain types of cancer. And, 
researchers will be able to track the long-term progress of individual cancer 
cases, Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the registry will generate data about the incidence and type of cancer 
in San Diego, its reporting mechanism is designed to protect the 
confidentiality of individual cancer patients, Saltzstein said. SANDIOCC won't 
identify cancer victims or the doctors and hospitals that provide treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The registry will release geographical data about where the cancers develop. 
Researchers will use that data to learn whether suspected clusters of cancers 
are linked to environmental causes, said Cedric Garland, an associate professor 
of family medicine at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Garland believes data could help settle the debate about whether 
electric transmission lines generate electromagnetic fields that cause cancers. 
Researchers could plot the exact incidence of cancers in a given area and 
"superimpose a map of the power lines to see if there is a relationship," 
Garland said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the registry's first year is "valuable, but (the project) will get 
more valuable with each year's additions," Garland said. "This is a leap ahead" 
for researchers, Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 researchers already have submitted data requests to SANDIOCC, 
according to SANDIOCC program manager Joe Raffa. 
</P>
<P>
Before the SANDIOCC project, most data about the incidence and type of cancer 
in San Diego was drawn from a statewide project that, since the 1940s, has 
surveyed 10% of Californians who developed cancer. That data, while accurate, 
did not give researchers enough information to focus on individual populations 
or specific geographic areas, Saltzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in cancer registries is growing, Raffa said. Nearly 40 states are 
creating registries or have passed legislation enabling the creation of 
registries. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought is that we'd eventually have a national registry," Saltzstein 
said. "This is the obvious way to start." 
</P>
<P>
The state-financed cancer registry is modeled after an Orange County one, which 
began in 1980. State legislators approved funding for a statewide system of 
registries in 1985, Saltzstein said.

NORTH COUNTY TRASH-TRANSFER PLAN GETS COOL RECEPTION FROM OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was grumbling and a bit of finger-pointing Thursday as staff members from 
half a dozen North County cities got their first chance to comment on a county 
plan to put seven urban trash-collection sites in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, devised by a San Francisco-based consulting firm and county public 
works engineers, recommends that local communities choose seven of a total of 
17 sites nominated as potential trash "transfer stations" where local trash 
haulers would dump. The trash would then be sorted for recycling and reloaded 
in large tractor-trailer trucks for the long journey to a distant landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines announced her opposition to the one site 
nominated for the San Dieguito area, at the southeast corner of El Camino Real 
and Olivenhain Road. She said the site is one of the few in the city of 
Encinitas suitable for light industrial development, "and we need it for that." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos city representatives said one of three sites selected in their 
community, along Via Vera Cruz south of California 78, contains vernal pools 
that would make it ineligible for development. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Walsh, chief deputy director of the county Department of Public Works, 
reminded the community representatives that "the trash is going to have to go 
someplace" after the county landfill near San Marcos fills and is closed by the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh asked the city representatives to temper their criticism of the county 
report "with constructive recommendations" on alternative sites in the same 
vicinity. When the San Marcos landfill is closed, the urban transfer stations 
will be needed as way stations to a landfill far from the coastal area where 
the trash is generated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Public comment on the proposed in-city transfer stations will come at 10 
community meetings scheduled to be held from next Wednesday through Feb. 20. 
The scheduled meetings are: 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 17: Vista City Council at 2 p.m.; Encinitas City Council at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 23: Carlsbad City Council at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 24: Oceanside City Council at 9 a.m.; Escondido City Council at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 5: Solana Beach City Council at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 6: Bonsall Planning Group at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 13: San Marcos City Council at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 19: Fallbrook Planning Group at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 20: Del Mar City Council at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sites recommended in the study are: 
</P>
<P>
Vista: two sites off Sycamore Avenue in the southern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas: a single candidate at El Camino Real and Olivenhain Road. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad: five sites east of Interstate 5 along Palomar Airport Road. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside: two sites, one off Mission Avenue east of the Oceanside Municipal 
Airport, the other north of Oceanside Boulevard east of El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido: two sites, one on a linear strip along California 78 west of 
Interstate 15, the other south of Washington Avenue west of Spruce Street. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos: three sites, one on Via Vera Cruz and two off Questhaven Road west 
of the existing county landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook: two sites east of I-15, north of Pala Road. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh answered criticism from community officials about the many sites by 
explaining that selection of seven way stations would lessen traffic at any 
single site. But, Walsh conceded, if community opposition were fierce, the 
county Board of Supervisors, which has the final say in the selection, may opt 
to pare down the number of sites. 
</P>
<P>
The county board also will be considering a plan to offer incentives to 
communities who agree to accept trash from their neighbors.

SAN DIEGO CAN EXPECT UP TO HALF AN INCH OF RAIN THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weather this weekend should be ideal for alphabetizing your record 
collection, regrouting the bathroom tile or camping out in front of the 
television to watch the Rams-49ers football game. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it's going to pour. Maybe buckets. At the very least, San Diego 
can expect up to half an inch of rain along the coast and more than an inch in 
the mountains this weekend, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm will also bring lower temperatures countywide, plus winds of up to 25 
m.p.h. along the coast and of up to 40 m.p.h. in the mountains, said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara. Snow in the mountains may reach 
the 5,500-foot level, he added. 
</P>
<P>
High tides combined with surf of up to 6 feet may pose problems at the beaches, 
Shigehara said. Today's high tide will be 7 feet. It will be 6.4 feet at 10:09 
a.m. Saturday and 5.7 feet at 10:48 a.m. Sunday, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tides are fairly large now, and, with the surf at 4 to 6 feet, we could 
see some wind-generated waves up to 8 feet on the weekend," he said. "We may 
have some minor overflow problems at the beaches. . . . I don't think we should 
let our guards down." 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for this wet and wild weekend is the tail of a large Gulf of Alaska 
storm that wreaked havoc on the Pacific Northwest earlier this week, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beach highs through Sunday are expected to range from 57 to 62 degrees, he 
said. The ocean temperature is 58. 
</P>
<P>
Highs today along the coast will range from 62 to 67 and dip to 60 to 65 on the 
weekend, Shigehara said. Overnight lows of 49 to 54 tonight and in the mid-40s 
Saturday night are forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs will imitate coastal temperatures through Sunday. Overnight lows 
are forecast to be from 42 to 50 tonight, from 38 to 46 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains are in for a bluster, with winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h., 
Shigehara said. Daytime highs this weekend will struggle to get past 40 
degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain lows will be between 32 and 40 tonight and 28 and 35 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs today will range from 70 to 78 and from 65 to 70 on the weekend. 
Overnight lows will be in the mid-40s tonight and Saturday night, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego should start drying out Sunday night, but another storm is expected 
to hit late Wednesday, Shigehara said. The new storm is expected to bring even 
lower temperatures and frost advisories to the agricultural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old man was found guilty Thursday of first-degree murder in the 
bludgeoning death of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
After five hours of deliberations, a San Diego Superior Court jury convicted 
Filomeno Huerta of Escondido in the Sept. 5 death of Silvia Flores, 23, also

<P>
Judge William Kennedy set sentencing for Feb. 8. Huerta could be sentenced to a 
maximum of 25 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the defendant testified at the trial that Huerta talked about the 
murder and even drove out to the site with one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was hit over the head with a broken concrete block and also stabbed. 
The body was found Sept. 16 in a drainage ditch near San Pasqual Road. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
He remains in jail without bail.

rose 59% to $807.3 million. The congressionally chartered private firm, which 
buys mortgages from banks and other lenders and repackages them as investment 
instruments, said "lower interest rates created a strong secondary market for 
fixed-rate mortgage purchases at attractive spreads and also provided an

American Medical International Inc.: The Beverly Hills health-care firm posted 
a first-quarter loss of $53.7 million, contrasted with a profit of $440,000 a 
year ago, as a result of one-time merger costs totaling $128 million relating 
to IMA Holdings Corp.'s purchase of about 86% of AMI's outstanding common 
shares. Revenue rose 13% to $728 million. The firm, which operates 48 acute 
care and six psychiatric hospitals in the United States, plus 24 hospitals 
overseas, noted that excluding the merger costs, there were increased patient 
activity levels and progress in its cost-reduction and divestiture programs.

'MISS DAISY' CAST SKILLFULLY AVOIDS PITFALLS OF SCRIPT 
</P>

Morgan Freeman's performances this year in "Lean on Me," "Johnny Handsome," 
and, now, "Driving Miss Daisy," have been among the best reasons to go to the 
movies. (He's also in "Glory," the Civil War drama opening today.) Freeman has 
an infuriating habit of being extraordinary even in mediocre movies; his 
presence, alas, makes them must-sees. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy," (at selected San Diego County theaters), directed by 
Bruce Beresford and adapted by Alfred Uhry from his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1987 
play, isn't mediocre. It's musty and schematic, though, with a measured pace 
that's meant to incur our respect. This is "quality" theater transferred 
relatively intact to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The central relationship is between Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy), a cranky 
Atlanta widow and Hoke (Freeman), the chauffeur hired by Daisy's son Boolie 
(Dan Aykroyd) to keep her from plowing her brand-new '48 Packard into the 
neighbor's flower beds. The film takes us through 25 years of winsome acrimony 
between these two. Their mellowing relationship is meant to mirror the growth 
of civil rights in the South. Daisy is Jewish, and so the movie is structured 
as a tale of two outcasts bonded by their stubborn pride. 
</P>
<P>
It is to everybody's credit that the stubbornness never gets mushed into 
sentimentality, at least not overtly. Freeman and Tandy have their own 
performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in 
particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion. When something 
heartfelt occurs in this movie, you accept it without too much squirming. The 
disciplined yet intuitive way in which these actors connect is a model of 
ensemble performance. 
</P>
<P>
One of the film's pleasant oddities is that Hoke and Daisy seem to look younger 
as they grow older. Bickering brings out their human contours; it gets their 
spirit up. Hoke plays a canny game with Daisy; he does her bidding without 
lapsing into servility. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been easy for Freeman to distance himself from this character by 
cuing us with modern attitudes. Instead, he accepts Hoke's subservience as a 
characteristic of the man's innate graciousness. Daisy is, in fact, subservient 
to him, but he never throws her helplessness back at her. The shadow play 
between Hoke and Daisy is immensely subtle, even though the film is structured 
as a series of mini-revelations about the nature of interracial brotherhood. 
The actors know those lessons don't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
The predictability of "Driving Miss Daisy" (rated PG) derives from the play's 
tone of civic uplift. The tensions between Hoke and Daisy exist only to be 
resolved. Their 25-year communion is more than a personal triumph; it is 
intended as a moral triumph as well. This may be too much baggage for such a 
frail vehicle, and the occasional bulletins from the front -- like the bombing 
of the local synagogue or a speech by Martin Luther King -- don't seem to be 
taking place in Hoke and Daisy's shuttered universe. 
</P>
<P>
Since Uhry bothered to "open up" the play, he should have opened up the cast of 
characters a bit more, too. The sequences in which Hoke talks with his friends, 
or with Daisy's maid, Idella (Esther Rolle), are revelatory. We can see how he 
drops his guard with them, how he moves freer, talks more animatedly. There's 
more of an edge to his sequences with Idella, in fact, than with Daisy, and 
that's largely because in those moments Uhry isn't pushing his customary 
principled restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Rolle's role is small, but it's a major performance. The same indignities that 
Hoke has braced himself against all his life have all but destroyed her. But 
Idella isn't anybody's mammy, and her sass gives the movie a much-needed jolt 
of rage. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sort of rage that would be out of place in Hoke's life, or in 
Freeman's performance. I hope nobody chooses to jump on Freeman's work here as 
a species of Uncle Tom-ism. By staying within the modest restraints of the 
role, Freeman does justice to Hoke's circumstances. The performance is not an 
apologia, it's a tribute. Freeman recognizes the heroism of a man who creates a 
life for himself based on kindness in an unkind world. 
</P>

The state-funded gallery, home of some of the greatest art treasures in 
Britain, said in a statement that the painting -- "The Madonna and Child With 
St. Joseph and the Infant Baptist" -- was cut in nine places in Wednesday's 
attack. Guards wrested the knife from the assailant, identified as Martin Came, 
27. The National Gallery said its conservation and restoration department will 
take "maybe more than a year" to repair the painting, which is said to be worth 
up to $1.6 million by one source and as much as $25 million by a British art 
critic. It has been on display since 1831. CLAUDIA PUIG

BEST OF THE SHORTS ARE BRITISH IN NORTHRIDGE ANIMATION FESTIVAL 
</P>

"The 1990 Festival of Animation," a program of 17 shorts from the United 
States, Canada, England and Holland opening tonight at the Cal State Northridge 
Campus Theater, features three extraordinary films by British artists that 
illustrate the versatility of the animator's art. 
</P>
<P>
Easily the most beautiful film in the program, Erica Russell's exquisitely 
sensual "Feet of Song," stands out as an example of sophisticated design and a 
celebration of the joy of motion. Semi-abstract figures composed of geometric 
shapes and brush lines of brilliant color dance to an upbeat Latin score. As 
the film progresses, groups of figures form complex patterns that recall the 
exuberance of Matisse's dance paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baker creates a bizarre, two-dimensional world of square sheep, circular 
chickens and angular people in "The Hill Farm." Although the antics of these 
odd creatures are often hilarious -- a ravenous pig devours its supper like an 
amoeba engulfing a smaller microbe; a farmhand scares off a Gargantuan bear by 
tapping it on the nose with a shepherd's crook -- Baker somehow manages to make 
their lives seem compelling. "The Hill Farm" has already won the British 
equivalent of the Academy Award, as well as prizes at major festivals in France 
and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
In "In and Out," the Canadian/British husband-and-wife team of David Fine and 
Alison Snowden infuse the familiar theme of the Seven Ages of Man with 
delightful absurdity that characterized their Oscar-nominated shorts, "Second 
Class Mail" and "George and Rosemary." During the wedding scene, the toy bride 
and groom leave the top of the cake for a lower layer furnished with miniature 
armchairs and a television set. 
</P>
<P>
Two films by American artists demonstrate the latest developments in 
computer-assisted character animation. The previously reviewed "Knickknack" by 
PIXAR's John Lasseter and Bill Reeves (who won the Oscar last year for "Tin 
Toy") focuses on the frustrations of a tiny snowman struggling to escape from a 
souvenir paperweight. "Locomotion" by Steve Goldberg of Pacific Data Images 
depicts a cartoon locomotive's determination to arrive on schedule -- at any 
cost. The opening sequence of the train emerging from a tunnel into a forest 
offers a dazzling example of the trompe-l'oeil realism that computer graphics 
can achieve. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining films in the Festival are less impressive. "Creature Comforts" 
from the British stop-motion studio, Aardman Animations, features clever 
designs and polished movements, but the voice artists provide all the humor and 
render the visuals superfluous. Bill Plimpton's "25 Ways to Quit Smoking" 
(U.S.A.) is basically a retread of his popular "Your Face." As pointless as it 
is ugly, "Black Hula" (Canada) by Marv Newland provides a good opportunity to 
sneak out for a cigarette, even if you don't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1990 Festival of Animation" continues at the Campus Theater through Jan. 
25, then plays at the State Theater in Pasadena, Jan. 26 through Feb. 3.

'INTERNAL AFFAIRS': GLOWERS, GLARES AND A PERFECTLY CAST GERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even at 40, Richard Gere has such a sensual smoothie's face -- like an evil 
grown-up boy with glittering eyes and an omnipresent cheek-tweaking smile -- 
that he's perfect casting for the sexy bad cop in the nervous, shallow cop 
thriller "Internal Affairs" (citywide). 
</P>
<P>
Gere's role, corrupt Dennis Peck, is an LAPD street cop, high-roller and 
all-around hedonist. Gere hasn't done a pure heavy like this since 1977's 
"Looking for Mr. Goodbar" -- and he plays Peck with relish: a happy, sly, 
sure-footed stud killing and conniving his way to the juiciest plums. Peck 
wears an omnipresent cocky, intimate grin, and he's so perpetually pleased with 
himself, he's such a master at pushing psychological buttons, he can talk 
almost anybody into almost anything. When that fails, he turns ruthless, whips 
out a gun or a choke-hold. Gere makes him a carnally hip seducer rotten with 
buoyant malice and sleek, rough-trade dandyism. 
</P>
<P>
The movie itself is another doppleganger melodrama, about cops and crooks 
having interchangeable personalities. Here, the man chasing Peck -- Andy Garcia 
as Internal Affairs investigator Raymond Avila -- gets so obsessed, he begins 
taking on Peck's personality, turning ruthless and seductive. When Peck goes 
after Avila's wife (Nancy Travis), leering and tossing around sadistic-erotic 
hints like Robert Mitchum's reptilian rapist in "Cape Fear," the circle is 
joined. Peck is the man who seduces everybody. When he can't, as with Avila's 
Lesbian partner Amy (Laurie Metcalf), he may as well try to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
There are all kinds of possibilities here for a classy, glossy thriller with 
dark undercurrents, but the movie fumbles them. It's fitfully exciting, 
erratically absorbing. But, scudded along on its smooth surfaces, you're always 
aware of chances muffed and cliches embraced. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, director Mike Figgis, who cooked up a lurid, smoky film noir stew of 
a style in "Stormy Monday," doesn't do much with Los Angeles here, even though 
his cinematographer, John Alonzo, once shot "Chinatown." The streets look flat 
and bright, empty and monotonous, like a stage set where everyone is waiting 
for the dry ice and steam to arrive. The first half of "Affairs" seems 
unusually set-bound. Then, suddenly we're deluged with car chases, murders and 
double-murders. 
</P>
<P>
The plot construction is erratic, almost as if scenarist Henry Bean had written 
all the scenes, and then shuffled them -- and the ending looks like another 
absurd last-minute tack-on. There's a thread here, but it develops High 
Concept-style, hopping along like an amphetamine-driven kangaroo. Only a few 
things hold it all together: Gere's bent villainy, an interesting jazz-rock 
score by Figgis , Anthony Marinelli and Brian Banks and the movie's leitmotif 
of glowering and glaring. Garcia has a drilling, killing stare that looks like 
a cartoon buzzard. Metcalf tops him; she has the sullen, eye-shadow stare of a 
robot grouch, programmed to humiliate. Meanwhile, Gere twinkles, smirks and 
flirts, as if he wanted to get an orgy going. 
</P>
<P>
Gere, Garcia and Metcalf are all magnetic actors and a battle of wits among 
them should be fascinating. But the battle here is half-witted. By the end of 
the film, Peck seems completely crazy, trying to pull off murderous stunts and 
scams no one could manage, juggling so many villainous balls -- including a 
murder-for-hire and complicated financial swindles -- that they're bound to 
tumble. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps things interesting are the two leads and a supporting actor or two, 
like Metcalf and yeoman Richard Bradford, wasted again as a growly superior. 
The story itself floats away half-way through -- leaving them all to glower and 
glare, dodge cars and bullets and wait for the inevitable last-stand crisis. 
Lost too is a potentially compelling theme: "Quis Custodiet" or "Who will keep 
the keepers themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
"Internal Affairs" (rated R for sex, violence, language) seems to be reaching 
for something new -- and near the end, there's a moment of black lunacy during 
Peck's rampage that suggests it's twisting toward nightmare comedy. But it 
never cuts loose. No matter how much come-hither villainy Gere generates, or 
how much envy and menace Garcia throws back at him, they're still trapped there 
in that bare, empty story, waiting for the dry ice and the steam to arrive.

'RITE OF SPRING' ON PBS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American dance has always taken genius for granted, forever pushing toward new 
artistic frontiers and discarding any previous achievements that seemed dated. 
Increasingly, however, cultural historians have worked to reclaim lost 
artifacts of dance history, aware in an era of conservation that creative 
greatness is just as perishable a resource as fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Crowning this interest in restoration and revival was a dance-reconstruction of 
miraculous proportions: the legendary, short-lived 1913 Vaslav Nijinsky 
choreography for "Le Sacre du Printemps," pieced together from the most meager 
and scattered evidence imaginable. The background of both the original Paris 
production and the 1987 re-creation for the Joffrey Ballet forms an 
introduction to a studio-taped performance on "The Search for Nijinsky's 'Rite 
of Spring' " tonight on PBS "Dance in America" (9:30 on KCET Channel 28). 
</P>
<P>
With Nicholas Roerich's stage designs enlarged to sound-stage proportions, this 
"Sacre" has a different look than in the theater -- and a different rhythm. 
Much of the work is devoted to formal group dancing: the hardest kind of 
choreography to make legible on the small screen. Director Thomas Grimm and 
editor Katarina Jonsson attempt to solve the problem by emphasizing short takes 
of small groups, and by carefully synchronizing their camera-cutting to Igor 
Stravinsky's score. 
</P>
<P>
This approach deprives the viewer of the work's brilliant 
movement-counterpoint, but it helps isolate Nijinsky's motifs and keeps lucid 
the relationship between dance and music. It gives us the building-blocks of 
"Sacre," if not the architecture. Led by Beatriz Rodriguez as the Chosen One, 
the Joffrey forces dance with a fervor that suggests the ritualistic power the 
ballet can attain on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Judy Kinberg and written by Holy Brubach, the documentary prologue 
is far less successful: superficial, badly organized, full of platitudes 
without ever really defining the artistic importance of the ballet under 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
It does, however, have Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer patiently explaining 
their research on "Sacre": the mixture of detective-work and educated guesses 
that led to the Joffrey production. Best of all, it has familiar but invaluable 
interview footage of Stravinsky and Marie Rambert (Nijinsky's assistant on 
"Sacre") that conveys the turbulent circumstances of the work's creation and 
premiere. LEWIS SEGAL

In Roy Dowell's latest paintings billboards have as much to do with figuring 
out the meaning of life as fine art ever could. He makes that blatantly clear 
by layering pieces of greatly enlarged commercial color separations into chunks 
of Cubist space and plugging in other pieces of a painterly vocabulary like 
various appliances on a power strip. 
</P>
<P>
Compositions that resemble game boards take on some significance with titles 
like "Truth or Consequences." Visually, however, there is just enough 
information to be vague. Oddly enough the painting's insistence on meaning 
eventually wins and understanding quickly becomes its own perceptual game -- 
one where reason and order come through as random assignments. That's a lot to 
get out of disparate patterns, spliced together into a dense arrangement of 
razor sharp, geometric shapes. Yet perhaps clued to the modern, megabyte mind 
set, they work. Together the paintings form a loose contemporary text on 
abstraction that, with typical pluralist acceptance, directs thought to a 
myriad of possible conclusions -- any and all of which are right. (Rosamund 
Felsen Gallery, 669 N. La Cienega Blvd., to Feb. 3.). SUVAN GEER

There is an edge of retribution brewing in the heartlands outside Peter Dean's 
verdant gardens. On the one hand all is calm. 
</P>
<P>
Thick, vivid color whips up a lush Van Gogh jungle-garden in Expressionist 
paint or lets slip a slick tourist-art sunset over a royal blue highway. But 
where people intrude, so does danger. Madness and violence bubble in the narrow 
boat of two cartoon-like good ol' boys in a swamp slicing the legs off frogs. 
One tilts his head back, exposing his neck to the bloody knife of the other 
figure, who has a red-spattered bucket. 
</P>
<P>
While Dean wanders the dangerous edges of insanity in a Red Groom's world going 
venomous, Janet Tholen's shallow three-dimensional paintings haunt the deserted 
temples and sites of ancient civilizations. Each slopes outward from the wall 
with sharp, single-point perspective, bearing a load of garishly artificial 
color and carefully scaled materials that give the feeling of miniature stage 
sets. The theatrical ploys give the temple scenes and deep cracks in the ground 
lined with sharpened sticks an unreal, manipulative edge that is further 
emphasized by the way the artist consistently bars entry into the suggested 
depths. The space initially appears open, but entry is impossible. It is 
tempting to see this play with the illusion of painterly space as a metaphor 
for the impenetrability of ancient cultures, but we can't help wondering at the 
Universal Studio's Tour approach that makes the whole thing so Hollywood.

Looking at Darren Waterston's atmospheric, virtually colorless landscape 
paintings is a bit like imagining familiar objects in knotholes. Silhouettes of 
waterfalls, mountains, trees and ghostly wanderers are conjured up through the 
alchemy of wood grain, thin washes of black and pale yellow oil paint, touches 
of graphite and veils of wax. The stately images sometimes seem calculated to 
evoke the ink paintings of Chinese masters -- particularly in the long, thin 
scroll-like formats of two "Scenes from Purgatory and Paradise." Several works 
have a darkly romantic, brooding quality created with liquid shapes and blurry 
points of light. 
</P>
<P>
A rather fey 18th-Century air permeates "Portrait of a Plague" in which a 
transparent, all-white, elegantly attenuated male figure stands on tiptoe with 
his palms out and his face a mask of fear. In a trio of small, wonderfully 
resonant "Myth" paintings, blurry lights and elusive figures hint at major 
themes in the realms of politics, religion and magic. Deftly slipping in and 
out of memories of historical periods of time with the most sparing of illusory 
means, Waterston is already sui generis -- pretty impressive for an artist 
still in his mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
Alison Saar's small folk art-style figures have the matter-of-factness of back 
fence gossip and the prideful toughness of lives that have endured stormy 
weather. Pieced together with bits of tin, chips of china and the sort of odds 
and ends you'd find in an old sewing basket, these wall pieces celebrate folks 
like "Jesus Jones" -- a guy with a halo and stigmata on both hands, who also 
holds a cigarette and has a transistor radio stuck in his rolled-up shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Plate Special" is a humorous way of describing Salome (with a rusted 
metal nude body and bright-red lips and nipples) carrying the head of John the 
Baptist on a plate. Saar's approach is like vernacular religion. Pieces with no 
apparent religious references usually suffer in comparison. But in "Chilley 
Willie," the image of a washboard musician -- made with a real washboard and a 
row of thimbles -- she translates the funky appeal of the music-making right 
into the heart of the work. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to Feb. 
10.) CATHY CURTIS

There's no one home inside the twisting overcoats that scud through many of Ed 
Nunnery's phantasmagoric paintings. Fires burn, night closes in, ragged 
buildings loom, empty streets suggest immanent menace and pending catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Nunnery knits together borrowings from Bosch, film noir, sci-fi thrillers and 
the zombie aspects of late 20th-Century life. Yet black humor -- or even a dash 
of genuine hope -- percolates through the swirling chaos and gloomy 
surroundings. In "It Could Be Worse," the passengers on a train all wear gas 
masks and a broken shark's head is visible through the windows. But one man 
reaches out for the hand of a fellow traveler, a sign of fellow-feeling even 
among the damned. 
</P>
<P>
"The Studio" surveys nocturnal spookiness on a huge, rambling scale. Small 
irritations inside the studio (a smoking phone, a fallen coffeepot) rise to a 
crescendo of weirdness in the city outside, with gloved fingers rising from the 
water, a burning church, a cowering blue ghost, a skeleton on the loose. Even 
when certain images seem rather cliche, the crazed intensity that animates his 
dream visions keeps the work vital. But in "Paper Airplane," he finds a strong, 
fresh image of civilization in decay: brilliant white paper airplanes landing 
in the gloom near a barbed wire fence, a hulking tank and a mirage-like Greek 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
Nunnery, who carves his painting frames into frenetic zig-zags, also makes 
goofily apocalyptic sculpture. A heraldic black "Bat" carved from cardboard has 
a vast wingspread, forked tongue and devilish tail. A cardboard "Tank" has the 
simple lines of a child's pull toy and the dark, pockmarked bulk of an 
instrument of doom. (Ovsey Gallery, 126 N. La Brea Ave., to Feb. 3.) -- C.C.

'MARRY ME A LITTLE': SONDHEIM TUNES FOR STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When this production of Stephen Sondheim's "Marry Me a Little" opened in San 
Francisco (to a healthy run at the Zephyr Theatre), the Chronicle's Gerald 
Nachman called it "more than a revue and not quite a musical." 
</P>
<P>
It can be one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Marry Me" concerns two lonely people in separate but adjacent Brooklyn 
apartments, spending a forlorn summer Saturday evening bemoaning their 
singularity. They never meet, except in their fantasies. The only plot line is 
the intermingling of those fantasies and the realization that they probably 
will never say hello to one another even as they pass in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
What makes it almost a musical is the couple's byplay as they hear each other 
moving about in their reveries to Sondheim's bright, clever songs, all rejects 
from other Sondheim scores. What makes it almost a revue is lack of linear 
connection between the songs. 
</P>
<P>
Directorial concept is all in "Marry Me a Little," and Art Manke leans heavily 
toward the revue format at the Coronet. His couple (Cynthia Gates and Kevin 
McMahon) actually see one another and are constantly aware of each other's 
presence. The only time the sense of their never meeting occurs is at the 
opening, as they arrive home from shopping, at the generic apartment that 
serves them both (Manke also designed the clever setting), and near the end of 
the show's 75 minutes, when she hears his shoes drop above and he hears her 
anger below as she slaughters roaches in her sink -- an ongoing New York 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they watch each other move around the apartment and, when the songs 
dictate, face front like the troupers they are -- Sondheim in revue. 
</P>
<P>
As revuers, Gates and McMahon are charming and handle with enthusiasm the ins 
and outs of Sondheim's melodies. Lem Jay Ignacio's keyboard accompaniment is a 
little plonky (Barry Lloyd is musical director) and sometimes overpowers the 
vocalists, but they manage to hold their own most of the time, particularly in 
Gates' bawdy "Can That Boy Foxtrot" and McMahon's "Uptown, Downtown" and a 
couple of the more rousing duets. 
</P>
<P>
Without the effect of the Man and Woman never seeing one another, dancing 
together without touching and without acknowledging each other's presence, the 
sum of this "Marry Me," is less than its parts, those wonderful Sondheim tunes 
saved from oblivion by Craig Lucas and Norman Rene (who created the original 
production). This staging is for Sondheim fans only, who want to relish the 
sound of his genius, even in outtakes.

The dual-deck VCR, which is a boon to piracy in the home-video market, will 
finally be available to consumers March 28 -- after five years of product 
development and legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
This revolutionary machine, marketed by Go-Video of Scottsdale, Ariz., and 
manufactured by the Korean company Samsung, was on display at the Consumers 
Electronics Show, which concluded here this week. Known as the VCR-2, the 
machine, anticipated with both glee and dread depending on who you're talking 
to in the home-video industry, may have far-reaching effects. 
</P>
<P>
Though the VCR-2 will certainly be attractive to consumers, it's also a 
blessing for small video retailers. For video manufacturers, though, it's as 
welcome as a plague. 
</P>
<P>
Selling for $999, the VCR-2 has two wells, one for a blank tape and one for a 
recorded cassette -- markedly simplifying home cassette-copying. Want your own 
copy of "When Harry Met Sally . . ." but don't want to shell out $90 for it? 
With the VCR-2 you can rent a copy for $2 and transfer it to a blank tape that 
you bought for $5. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, copying tapes at home is only possible by hooking two VCRs 
together. This procedure is not only expensive -- buying two VCRs -- but it 
also usually results in inferior copies, with fuzzy images and blurred colors. 
The low-quality dupes and the hassle of using two machines has discouraged 
home-copying. 
</P>
<P>
But with the dual-deck VCR, dubbing -- or copying -- is a breeze. It's much 
like using the double-welled decks in your stereo system for copying audio 
tapes. Judging from the demonstration at the Go-Video exhibit, making a copy on 
the VCR-2 -- which is done in real time rather than high speed -- is an 
uncomplicated process. 
</P>
<P>
The VCR-2's most attractive feature, though, is that it makes excellent copies. 
A display at the Go-Video exhibit showed how even a fifth-generation copy -- 
with all copies made on the Go-Video deck -- was only slightly inferior to the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
This VCR is the first of its kind available anywhere in the world, boasted 
Terry Dunlap, co-inventor of the machine and chief executive officer of 
Go-Video. 
</P>
<P>
What has kept the machine off the market so long is legal battles with Japanese 
manufacturers who, Dunlap charged, didn't want it competing with the standard, 
single-deck VCR, most of which are made in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese cartel didn't want our machine out there competing against their 
machines," he said. "We had to file antitrust suits against them. The battle is 
still going on, but we've gotten $2 million in settlements. We're trying to 
recover some of the revenues and profits we've lost by being kept out of the 
marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Dunlap tried to have the machine manufactured in Japan. "But they 
banded together to freeze me out of the market," he said. "But Samsung (a 
Korean company) came to me and said they'd manufacture it." 
</P>
<P>
Only 80,000 to 150,000 machines will be made by the end of the year, Dunlap 
said, so the major effect of the machine may be a few years away. Still, its 
availability may quickly be felt in Hollywood if many of the first units are 
purchased by small video retailers. In their struggle to compete with 
prosperous chains, they could cut their overhead by buying one copy of a title 
and making several others. 
</P>
<P>
Such an action would be an illegal copyright infringement, but it would be 
difficult for video distributors to police the thousands of video outlets 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Not all tapes can be copied, however. The dual-deck VCR does not override 
Macrovision, the anti-copying process added to many videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
This is the result of an agreement made in September, 1988, with the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America, which speaks for the video companies that lose 
revenue when their product is illegally copied. Now the association, according 
the public affairs director Charlene Soltz, hails the VCR-2. 
</P>
<P>
But video companies still aren't likely to embrace it. Though most of the major 
movies are encoded with Macrovision, many titles aren't. According the Dunlap, 
only 15% of the new movies released on home video last year were protected by 
Macrovision. Companies use Macrovision sparingly because its cost cuts into 
their already narrow profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
"We may all have to use Macrovision if this machine becomes popular," said Reg 
Childs, president of Nelson Entertainment. What the VCR-2 can do, he said, "is 
just plain thievery." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the consumer may suffer -- as well as video retailers who don't 
resort to copying. Video manufacturers, to make up for the cost of Macrovision 
and lost revenues from copying, may raise wholesale prices. Such hikes, of 
course, will be passed on to the consumer through rental increases.

Topping many critics' best-of-'89 lists, Spike Lee's provocative "Do the Right 
Thing" (MCA, $89.95, R) is a controversial drama concerning racial tensions on 
a summer day in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant community. The cast includes 
Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Lee himself. "The Women of Brewster 
Place" (J2, $79.95 for the two-cassette set) is a 180-minute release that 
combines the two parts of this thoughtfully made TV movie about seven black 
women who work together to improve their lives. This was Oprah Winfrey's TV 
acting debut, and the filming of Gloria Naylor's novel also stars Cicely Tyson, 
Robin Givens and Paula Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Also concerning social strife, though for the young people of Northern Ireland, 
is "Children in the Crossfire" (Vestron, $79.98), a George Schaefer-directed TV 
movie from 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Hollywood-as-usual, "Pink Cadillac" (Warner, $89.95, PG-13) throws 
together Clint Eastwood and Bernadette Peters in an action-comedy about a 
skip-tracer (someone who hunts down people who skip bail) and his involvement 
with the woman he pursues. If the plot reminds you of the 1988 Robert De 
Niro-Charles Grodin film "Midnight Run," the quality probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
More Hollywood-as-usual: "Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!" (IVE, 
$89.95, PG-13), and "Signs of Life" (IVE, $89.95, PG-13). 
</P>
<P>
From Britain: "Paperhouse" (Vestron, $89.98, PG-13), an intelligent 1988 horror 
film starring Ben Cross and Glenne Headly, which, like the "Nightmare on Elm" 
series, has scary fun with the confusion between dreams and reality; and 
"Wonderland" (Vestron, $79.98, R), a Philip Savile-directed drama about two 
boys who witness a murder. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Two excellent 100-minute documentaries shown on PBS, "W.C. Fields Straight Up" 
(narrated by Dudley Moore) and "The Marx Brothers in a Nutshell" (narrated by 
Gene Kelly), lovingly survey the careers of some of the funniest performers who 
ever lived, with generous film clips. They're $59.98 each from Vestron. TERRY

The Country Club, the area's longtime showcase of popular music, plans to try 
again this year to regain the liquor privileges it lost in November, 1988. 
Since losing its right to serve alcohol -- a group of residents had complained 
that rowdy club patrons created disturbances in the neighborhood -- the Reseda 
club has generally catered to young crowds who will forgo drinking to follow 
their favorite speed metal or punk band. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what has kept us alive," said Scott Hurowitz, the club's general 
manager. "These kids don't need to drink. They love their bands." The club will 
continue to feature metal and punk bands. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, the Circle Jerks, a Los Angeles-based punk band, will perform at 8 
p.m. The show costs $15. And on Jan. 27, two commercial metal bands, Terriff 
and Burn, will play. According to promoter Jason Lord, Terriff is close to 
being signed by a major record label. The show costs $12. 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz added that the club, which featured familiar performers like Deborah 
Harry, and the Replacements in 1989, will again try to book popular acts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rock 'n' roll at other venues in the Valley will continue to 
highlight local bands with loyal followings and well-known acts. At other clubs 
around the Valley: 
</P>
<P>
FM Station: Local metal rock is also this club's forte, and owner Filthy 
McNasty said that's not likely to change this year, although he said the North 
Hollywood club will try to bring back well-known performers like Dr. Hook, Leon 
Russell and Eric Burdon. 
</P>
<P>
"But this club is not going to do too many revival acts," McNasty said. "There 
are too many oldies coming back. If we did that, the new groups would stay 
away, thinking we don't have any new and hip groups." 
</P>
<P>
McNasty added the club should hold its long-postponed television pilot this 
year. The show, FM Station Live, was supposed to be taped last year, but 
scheduling conflicts caused several cancellations. The show would tape the 
area's best unsigned local bands performing live each week. McNasty said he 
hopes to persuade a local or national television station to carry the show. 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, the club has booked with an array of local talent: Jan. 17, 
Big Guns; Feb. 1, Fire in the Sky; and Feb. 14, Wyld Hearts. Shows cost either 
$4 or $5. Doors open at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Palomino: Bill Thomas, owner of the North Hollywood club, said tentative plans 
are under way to initiate a weekly "BAM JAM" -- an all-out jam by various local 
bands. Discussions are still preliminary, but Thomas hopes to have 
representatives from BAM magazine critique the contesting groups. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, no major changes are anticipated. Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance, which 
was carried on KCSN-FM until the station switched to classical music in 
November, will continue each Tuesday night at 9. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 16, Mack and a host of other performers will celebrate the Barn Dance's 
two-year anniversary. Among the scheduled guests: Big Jay McNeely, whose 1959 
pop hit, "There Is Something on Your Mind," made the R&amp;B charts; Gene 
Clark, an original member of the Byrds; Carla Olson, lead singer of the 
Textones, and singer Lucinda Williams, who performs a variety of folk, country 
and blues. Mack said he will keep trying to find radio stations to carry the 
concerts, but "we'll continue regardless." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 30, Barn Dance will host a special album release party for Chris 
Gaffney, recently voted by Music Connection magazine as the second most popular 
country act. Gaffney will do a variety of hillbilly, rockabilly, rhythm and 
blues, and Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
Bebop Records and Fine Art: Owner Richard Bruland has fought a nonstop battle 
to stay one step ahead of financial disaster, frequently holding benefits to 
keep the club alive. For now, Bruland said there is no threat of imminent 
closure, and the Reseda club will continue to present its distinctive blend of 
rock, pop and alternative music. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming shows include: Hollis, a female vocalist who combines pop and country, 
on Jan. 26; Eugene Chadborne, former member of Shockabilly, on Feb. 6, and This 
Great Religion on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Concerts will remain free, with donations voluntary. Shows begin at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn Saloon: On Feb. 6, at 8 p.m., the Canoga Park club will celebrate Dave 
Durham's 36th birthday with a special tribute, including harmonica player David 
McKelvy and singer Dean Dobbins. In the last two years, Dobbins has had three 
singles reach the top five in the national independent country charts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Silk 'N Spurs, the winners of the California Country Music Assn.'s 
Dance Team of the Year, will perform. 
</P>
<P>
Durham of Van Nuys, who was voted songwriter of 1989 by CCMA for his hit 
single, "In My Car," also will be treated to Billboard's top 10 country songs 
from Feb. 5, 1954, the date of his birth. Among the hits: "I Really Don't Want 
to Know," by Eddy Arnold; "Secret Love," by Slim Whitman; and "I Don't Hurt Any 
More," by Hank Snow. The songs will be performed by several guest disc jockeys 
from Los Angeles-based radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
Durham captured a host of country music awards in the past year. He and his 
band, the Bull Durham Band, were voted by CCMA as 1989's best group.

U.S. SEES BALTIC STATES WINNING THEIR FREEDOM

<P>
The Bush Administration has concluded that Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia 
probably will succeed in winning some form of independence from the Soviet 
Union and has decided that the best policy for the United States is simply to 
keep out of the way, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think independence is coming" for the three Baltic states, one official 
said. "It may take some time, and there may be a transitional period first. But 
the whole direction of the process is toward independence." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long called for independence for the three tiny states, 
which were seized and incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. But only in 
the past two years, as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has allowed 
nationalist movements to organize in the area, has the goal become real. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, now that independence may finally be in sight, the Administration 
has decided to stop speaking about it in public, officials said. "We've decided 
that saying nothing may be the best course," one declared. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, President Bush and other officials have taken pains to praise Gorbachev 
for his approach to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"To the man's credit, he has been the big advocate of peaceful change," Bush 
told reporters last week in response to a question on the Baltic states. "He 
has been the advocate of reform. . . . I hope that this approach that he has 
taken, for which we give credit, will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Bush even referred to the Baltic states as "internal affairs" of the Soviet 
Union -- a description that violates the formal U.S. refusal to recognize their 
absorption by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials said the formal position still stands. But they said that, in 
practice, the best way to encourage Moscow to grant independence to the Baltic 
states is to make the process as painless as possible for Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see us talking more about 'self-determination' for the 
Baltics, instead of 'independence,' " one official said. "The word 
'independence' is like sticking a finger in the Soviets' eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The officials say they expect serious negotiations between Moscow and Baltic 
political leaders to begin after Soviet elections this spring. Lithuania's 
local Communist Party already has decided to allow multi-party elections, and 
Latvia and Estonia are expected to follow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will be aimed at devising arrangements for the autonomy of the 
Baltic states within the Soviet Union. "But it is clearly the intention of most 
people in the Baltics to turn autonomy into independence," one U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the three republics may evolve quickly into states that are 
formally part of the Soviet Union, but independent in "everything except 
foreign policy and defense." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who began a three-day visit to Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on 
Thursday, "may come away with a much better grasp of how strong the desire for 
independence is," the official said. The fact that Gorbachev took several 
members of the Soviet leadership with him suggested that he may be seeking to 
build a consensus for his relatively liberal policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has promised Bush that he will not use force to put down the peaceful 
independence movements of the Baltics, according to American officials. "He 
(Gorbachev) keeps reiterating his conviction about peaceful change," Bush said 
last week. "So, I support that. But we did have an opportunity to discuss in 
broad philosophical terms this question" at the Malta summit last month. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Gorbachev's policy, one U.S. official said, is "peaceful change." As 
long as the nationalist movements in the Baltics remain nonviolent, the Soviet 
leader appears willing to negotiate with them. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Baltics have been very good about sticking to nonviolence," he added. 
"That has not been the case in other parts of the Soviet Union, like 
Azerbaijan." 
</P>
<P>
Official U.S. spokesmen stuck carefully to the Administration's decision to 
avoid saying anything that might get in Gorbachev's way. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to speculate on the political difficulties in the Soviet 
Union," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "The President 
certainly supports the reforms and the efforts that . . . Gorbachev has made." 
When questioned by reporters, Fitzwater acknowledged that the United States 
still does not recognize the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet 
Union. But, he added, "We don't want to take any positions that are not helpful 
to either side."

MATSUI MAY SEEK CRANSTON SENATE SEAT 
</P>

<P>
Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) has decided to challenge Sen. Alan 
Cranston of California for the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992, hoping to 
capitalize on Cranston's flagging popularity in the wake of the Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan scandal, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui, a six-term House member, is the first of what may be several potential 
Democratic challengers to Cranston, who is under investigation by the Senate 
Ethics Committee for his efforts on behalf of the Irvine thrift's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's decision to challenge Cranston is a measure of how seriously the 
incumbent has been weakened politically by Lincoln's $2-billion collapse and 
the subsequent ethics scandal. Until recently, no other Democrat would have 
dared to challenge the Senate's second-ranking Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cranston's campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, greeted the news of 
Matsui's decision with scorn. "If he runs," said Kuwata, "he'll end his 
career." 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Matsui has told many of his closest acquaintances in 
Washington that he has made a firm decision to enter the Senate race shortly 
after this November's election, when he hopes to be reelected to a seventh 
House term. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matsui declined to confirm the reports, he acknowledged that he is 
considering a bid against Cranston. "People are talking to me about it, and I 
am looking," he said in a telephone interview from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
One source in Washington said Matsui is reluctant to announce his intentions 
now because "he does not want to appear to be dancing on Alan's grave." 
</P>
<P>
As a Japanese-American who led a congressional battle to win $1.25 billion in 
reparations for 66,000 people who, like himself, lived in detention camps 
during World War II, Matsui can expect considerable financial and voter support 
from California's Asian-American community. In addition, his service on the 
House Ways and Means Committee gives him access to contributions from many 
national political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Matsui was encouraged to enter the race by a recent Times poll 
showing that Cranston's popularity had plunged from a 56% favorable, 32% 
unfavorable reading as recently as early October to a 32% favorable, 58% 
unfavorable rating in early December. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, a consummate political fund-raiser, acknowledged last month that the 
Lincoln scandal had hurt his ability to raise money for his 1992 race. But he 
predicted that he would make up for lost time during the congressional recess 
that ends Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democratic Party leaders in California are hoping Cranston will decide not 
to seek reelection in the face of primary opposition. But the incumbent, who 
will be 78 years old in 1992, has said frequently he has no intention of 
reconsidering his decision to seek a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said Cranston's longstanding image as a champion of the 
little guy was tarnished by his intervention with federal regulators on behalf 
of Lincoln, which was seized by the government last April and is expected to 
become the nation's most costly S&amp;L collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. was a major contributor to Cranston's 1986 
reelection race, and Cranston later joined four other senators in meeting with 
regulators to discuss Keating's complaints about their efforts to crack down on 
the institution. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Lincoln's collapse expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, 
it rendered worthless nearly $250 million in bonds issued by Lincoln's parent 
company and purchased in many cases by elderly thrift customers. Several 
bondholders have said they hold Cranston personally responsible for their 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
If Cranston bows out, according to sources, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) 
would probably enter the race against Matsui. Even if Cranston remains in the 
race, Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) is likely to seek the nomination with 
the strong support of pro-choice activists in California. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matsui, Boxer and Levine may not enjoy statewide name recognition, 
each lawmaker already has a House campaign war chest that could be spent on a 
Senate race. Any California-based challenger would have to start a federal 
political action committee from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's campaign fund currently contains $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, party strategists believe that Matsui should waste no time in 
announcing his candidacy for 1992. Because Matsui has twice previously declined 
to run statewide after considering a race, they said, Democrats will be 
skeptical of his intentions until he actually throws his hat in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tendency to like the idea of talking about running instead of 
actually running," Kuwata said. "My guess is he'll look at the race, consider 
it and decide he is not running."

Preparing for the historic criminal trial of a foreign head of state, the 
government is quietly maneuvering to ease out its self-declared chief 
prosecutor in the Manuel A. Noriega drug racketeering case, the brilliant but 
volcanic U.S. attorney in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a shake-up appears likely in the ousted dictator's defense team, 
with a nationally known defense attorney saying he has been approached about 
the case and other knowledgeable lawyers predicting a change. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind the possible shifts on both sides, attorneys and other 
officials close to the case said Thursday, is to put in place high-powered, 
seasoned legal practitioners for a trial that appears likely to make its mark 
in both history and legal books. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of putting together the strongest possible prosecution 
team," David Runkel, chief spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said 
Thursday. He insisted that no decisions have been made and that a "number of 
options are still under consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said Justice Department officials are pressing U.S. Atty. 
Dexter Lehtinen, a former state legislator who has declared his intention to 
try the case, to take a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
"There are discussions going on between here and Dexter Lehtinen's office," 
Runkel acknowledged, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, well-known New York defense lawyer Barry I. Slotnick, who 
represented subway gunman Bernard Goetz, said he has been approached to take 
over the Noriega defense from two Miami attorneys, Frank A. Rubino and Steven 
Kollin. 
</P>
<P>
The office of Richard (Racehorse) Haynes, a prominent defense attorney who is 
currently representing a woman accused of looting $16 million from an Orange 
County thrift, said Haynes has received a similar approach, although the report 
could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
And Neal R. Sonnett, a prominent Miami defense attorney who withdrew as 
Noriega's chief legal strategist last week over conflicts with Rubino and 
Kollin, said he is "leaving the door open" to rejoining a reorganized team. 
</P>
<P>
Other attorneys connected with the case, in which Noriega and 15 others have 
been indicted on drug-trafficking charges, said they anticipate a change in the 
former dictator's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual pretrial shifting is a sign of the importance of the Noriega case 
and the complexity of the issues it is likely to raise. 
</P>
<P>
Lehtinen, a Democrat-turned-Republican state legislator, was named U.S. 
attorney by Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III in June, 1988, but has not yet been 
nominated for the post by President Bush and is serving under temporary court 
appointment. He served as the government's chief courtroom lawyer at Noriega's 
hearings this week and last. 
</P>
<P>
Even before being formally nominated, Lehtinen stirred controversy with what 
has been described as a quick temper and a domineering style in the office, 
which presides over some of the government's most important drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
At a staff reorganization meeting last April, he waved in the air a rubber 
replica of a Russian AK-47 assault rifle and told startled prosecutors: "We're 
in a war, and the enemy is using real bullets," according to an account of the 
meeting by the Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, former prosecutors in the office said, he has displayed a 
volatile temper, throwing pens across the room, shouting at staff members and 
slamming doors. 
</P>
<P>
An Army lieutenant in Vietnam who lost his sight in one eye and suffered 
extensive facial injuries from shrapnel wounds that required 18 months of 
hospitalization, Lehtinen often uses military slogans and analogies to make his 
point with subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
"Learn the chain of command and follow it," he has told them. Runkel said the 
Justice Department this week sent to the White House the FBI background check 
on Lehtinen and related papers, usually the last step before a nomination is 
sent to the Senate for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. attorneys, who serve as the chief federal law enforcement officers for 
their districts, often personally try high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
But the demands of the high-volume Miami office, coupled with Lehtinen's 
limited courtroom experience over the last decade and his reportedly low 
boiling point, make him a less than ideal candidate for the Noriega trial, 
government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Cossin, chief spokeswoman for Lehtinen, said: "I will not comment on any 
rumor or speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Ostrow reported from Washington and Jackson reported from Miami. Special 
correspondent Mike Clary contributed to this story from Miami.

CHENEY SAYS REFORMS WILL SAVE $39 BILLION; 
</P>

DEFENSE: THE PENTAGON CHIEF'S 5-YEAR PLAN CALLS FOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES TO 
SIMPLIFY WEAPONS BUYING. HE URGES CUTTING 42,000 ACQUISITION OFFICIALS.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in the latest Defense Department management 
review, announced Thursday that reforms already under way will save $39 billion 
in the coming five years and reduce the rolls of officials who buy equipment 
and supplies by 42,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney unveiled a welter of management changes designed to slash bureaucratic 
red tape in the weapons-buying process, create a cadre of full-time acquisition 
experts and salvage relationships with experienced defense contractors that are 
now shunning new business with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cheney warned that coming cutbacks in defense spending will force 
"extensive" base closings beyond those approved by Congress last year. He 
refused to offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Leading lawmakers said they are "encouraged" by the Pentagon's new focus on 
management but they criticized the lack of a plan for implementing it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Management Review issued today offers no blueprint for 
implementation," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.). "We need one. That's where reform efforts have failed in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and six other 
lawmakers, in a letter to Cheney, urged the defense chief to join Congress in 
an "acquisition summit." 
</P>
<P>
Cautioning that radical changes will not come quickly, Cheney said that "$600 
toilet seats are sexy and easy to get people to focus on. The work of getting 
the Department of Defense to function in such a way that we don't have $600 
toilet seats is hard and complex and involves a lot of nitty-gritty detail." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who called on Congress to conduct a similar review of its demands on 
the Pentagon, likened the department's efforts to "three yards and a cloud of 
dust. It's not a 60-yard touchdown pass." 
</P>
<P>
In 1991 alone, Cheney said, the Defense Management Review is expected to save 
$2.3 billion and reduce the Pentagon's payroll by 16,000 military and civilian 
employees. Officials said that almost all of the prospective manpower cuts 
could be made by not replacing employees who retire or resign. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's reform efforts focus on reducing the number of people and 
systems needed to run the Pentagon's $300-billion-per-year operations. Cheney 
said he hopes to give more responsibility to lower-level acquisition 
professionals and to make them more accountable for their work. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the initiatives Cheney unveiled: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce regulations. Almost half of the regulations that guide Defense 
Department officials deal with the acquisition of goods and services. Of 400 
such directives reviewed, 50% were deemed unnecessary or duplicative and will 
be dropped or folded into other regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, about two-thirds of the 12,000 clauses regularly inserted into 
Pentagon contracts can be deleted "without hurting anything," according to 
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Simplify military specifications. The "milspecs" that dictate the 
requirements of a defense contract have swelled to more than 50,000, which are 
being reviewed to determine whether they remain useful. 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder it takes 20 pages of specifications to buy a fruitcake," said John 
A. Betti, undersecretary of defense for acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make the Pentagon shoulder the risk of high-technology contracts. With some 
of the Defense Department's most dependable contractors unwilling to bid on 
many Pentagon contracts, Atwood said that contracts must reduce unnecessary 
financial risks to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Atwood said the Pentagon will discontinue "wherever practical" the 
use of fixed-price contracts, which "tend to put contractors in the untenable 
position of developing high-risk programs at a fixed price." Such contracts 
became common during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage industry ethics and review financial arrangements. Defense 
contractors should police themselves for ethical practices, with Defense 
Department monitoring, Atwood said. In addition, he said the Pentagon will 
review its current policies on contractor profits and on progress payments -- 
funds disbursed in regular increments to defense contractors working on 
long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Atwood said the Pentagon is developing a contractor review system that 
will give firms with a solid history of performance on defense contracts an 
edge in winning new ones.

ADMIRAL QUITS AT BELEAGUERED MARITIME SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
The president of the beleaguered California Maritime Academy has resigned after 
sharp criticism that he permitted sexual harassment to occur aboard the 
academy's training ship and then failed to discipline those involved. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Adm. John J. Ekelund said in a letter to Bruce Johnston, chairman of 
the Academy Board of Governors, that he is retiring because "it is apparent 
that the academy is seriously threatened unless management changes are made." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors did not act on Ekelund's letter when it met at the 
Vallejo campus on Wednesday but sources at the academy said the resignation 
would be accepted and the search for a new president would begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a scathing report made public last fall, the National Maritime 
Administration accused Ekelund and other administrators of allowing female 
students to be sexually harassed on the annual cruises of the training ship 
Golden Bear and of not imposing appropriate discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Ekelund and others came under additional criticism at a hearing held by the 
state Senate Select Committee on the Maritime Industry last week. State Sen. 
Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) called on both Ekelund and Johnston to resign 
and other legislators have suggested that the state should stop funding the 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed meeting of his select committee Thursday, Marks said he was 
"sorry the academy has gotten itself into such a position that it is necessary 
for the admiral to resign." 
</P>
<P>
But Marks said "there is no excuse for the problems" at the merchant marine 
school and repeated his suggestion that Johnston and a majority of the Board of 
Governors also should resign. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's board meeting, after what one observer called "an hour and a 
half of acrimonious discussion," a vote of no confidence in Johnston was 
defeated, 3 to 2, with Johnston casting the deciding vote for himself. "That's 
pretty unusual," Marks said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip C. Kazanjian, the board member who introduced the "no confidence" 
motion, said he might try again next month, if all seven voting board members 
are present. 
</P>
<P>
Kazanjian said board members "seemed to like my idea" for an outside 
investigation of the Maritime Academy but they want it done by a retired 
service academy official, not by a lawyer, as Kazanjian had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume they think a lawyer would be pretty thorough and somebody else might 
not be as unkind," said Kazanjian, a Glendale attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Marks said his committee has decided to hold a hearing on a recent 
legislative analyst's report that suggested the state might not need the 
Maritime Academy because of an apparent national surplus of merchant marine 
deck and engineering officers. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old academy where merchant marine officers are trained has 410 
students, a faculty of 40 and a budget of about $9.7 million, of which $7.5 
million is provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Ekelund, a former U.S. Navy officer, has been president since 1983.

'STORM DOOR' CREAKING OPEN

<P>
Southern Californians can expect a wet weather pattern to prevail for three to 
five days, beginning today with a chance of showers in the moisture-starved Los 
Angeles Basin, forecasters say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at an increasing chance of rain through the weekend," said 
meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. "It looks like we have a chance of rain Sunday, unsettled conditions 
Monday and a chance of rain Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann's outlook is supported by the National Weather Service, which sees a 
30% chance of showers today in the Los Angeles area, advancing to 60% on 
Saturday with windy, cooler weather and highs in the middle to upper 60s. 
</P>
<P>
As for next week, Dittmann said, he is keeping his fingers crossed that the 
passing weather front will open the "storm door" for California and bring much 
needed rain and snow. His thinking goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
As a slow-moving low-pressure system, which has produced a "100-year" storm in 
parts of the Pacific Northwest, moves eastward it may carve out a low-pressure 
area behind it off the coast, permitting the jet stream to pour through and 
bring a succession of precipitation-rich weather fronts to California, now in 
the third year of subnormal rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a possibility at this time," Dittmann said. "But now we are starting 
to see some good signs. And, that's what California needs." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann noted that since the current rainfall season started on July 1 only 
1.52 inches of moisture have been recorded at the Los Angeles Civic Center as 
of Thursday, compared to the normal rainfall for the date of 5.47 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heavy blanket of fog that reduced visibility to nearly zero in 
parts of Southern California and moved into inland valleys Wednesday night and 
early Thursday is expected to diminish as the weather front moves in. 
</P>
<P>
The dense fog caused more than a half-dozen flights to be diverted from Orange 
County's John Wayne Airport to as far away as San Diego Wednesday night. But 
officials said flight operations at Los Angeles International Airport were not 
significantly affected. 
</P>
<P>
The fog led agriculture officials to cancel scheduled spraying for Medflies in 
the San Gabriel Valley for a second straight night Thursday. Fog slowed 
Wednesday morning commuter traffic on metropolitan streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service issued an advisory, warning of fog in coastal areas from 
Santa Barbara to southern Orange County. It was canceled about mid-morning on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature at the Civic Center on Thursday was 75 degrees.

LOBBYIST TESTIFIES $500 WAS GIVEN TO INFLUENCE MONTOYA

<P>
A lobbyist who gave the nickname "El Bandito" to Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
testified Thursday that he did not recall the senator ever asking for a payment 
in exchange for his vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Cline, a former Republican assemblyman from Los Angeles, told a 
federal court jury that "money talked" in the state Capitol and that his 
clients gave Montoya a $500 campaign contribution in an effort to influence the 
Whittier Democrat's vote on a crucial bill. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is on trial on 12 counts of extortion, racketeering, bribery and 
money-laundering. One of the counts alleges that the senator solicited a $500 
contribution from Cline's client, the California Independent Producers Assn., 
which was seeking passage of legislation giving it a competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In an illuminating discussion of how the political system sometimes works, 
Cline said he recommended that the oil producers' association make 
contributions to five members of a Senate committee, including Montoya, in 
order to secure passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Cline said he told his clients that "legislators tend to vote for their 
friends. One way of showing friendship is to be a contributor." 
</P>
<P>
After the oil producers agreed to make contributions to the senators, Cline 
said he told Montoya a donation was coming. "I felt it better to have a 
pro-active contribution and not put myself in the position of being solicited 
for one," Cline told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Called as a witness in Montoya's defense, Cline testified that there was no 
"quid pro quo." And, in testimony that could be helpful to the senator, the 
lobbyist testified he did not recall an alleged conversation in which Montoya 
asked about the money. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, prosecution witness Thomas Hunt, executive vice president 
of the association, said Montoya approached Cline after the hearing and asked, 
"Has my matter been taken care of?" Hunt said Cline responded, "Yes, Senator, I 
think so," and then, as the senator walked away, repeated the nickname, "El 
Bandito." 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Cline told the jury that he did not recall such a conversation 
and remembered only that Montoya was in a rush to leave. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged calling the senator "El Bandito" on an earlier occasion when 
the lobbyist met with Hunt and other members of the association to discuss 
making a contribution to the senator. He said the nickname was based on 
Montoya's reputation in the Capitol and that he regretted using it, adding that 
his irreverence was "misplaced." 
</P>
<P>
Two other defense witnesses, Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) and 
Assemblywoman Sonny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) testified that they received 
honorariums of $10,000 each in 1987 as awards from the California Correctional 
Peace Officers Assn. The group represents the state's prison guards, who have 
long lobbied for building new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael Sands was attempting to show that the two legislators 
did little to earn the money. Both said they delivered brief speeches at the 
association's annual convention in Reno and that the checks were an award from 
the group for their past support. 
</P>
<P>
However, on cross-examination, Presley and Mojonnier said they never did 
anything to solicit the money and never offered to exchange their vote for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said the Fair Political Practices Commission examined her award 
payment and concluded "that there was nothing unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, it was business as usual for Montoya for about 90 minutes 
as he chaired a meeting of his Senate Business and Professions Committee in the 
Capitol, four blocks from the courthouse where he is on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing somewhat subdued, Montoya attempted to work out compromises on such 
matters as a bill that would require grocery stores to provide customers with 
their choice of plastic or paper bags. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Les Howe, a lobbyist for retail stores, pointed out that the bill 
would include no penalty for stores that failed to provide one bag or the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to put a felony (penalty) in there?" Montoya asked facetiously. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) was rejected by the committee on a 
4-4 vote. Montoya voted for the measure telling his colleagues, "I just cast a 
vote for it to try to help him out." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Montoya was asked whether being on trial 3 1/2 days each 
week was making it difficult for him to perform his Senate duties. "Well, I 
would say that I have no comment," the senator said. "I think you can draw you 
own conclusions, as (defense attorney) Michael Sands would say."

ASTRONAUTS TURN PLUMBERS TO TACKLE LEAK ON SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thursday was a "relatively easy day in orbit" for the five astronauts of the 
space shuttle Columbia, NASA officials said, despite the fact that they had to 
spend three hours sopping up one to two gallons of water from a leaky 
dehumidifier. 
</P>
<P>
Their schedule had purposely been kept light in case the launch of a Navy 
communications satellite, successfully deployed Wednesday, had to be moved back 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
After the cleanup, pilot Daniel C. Brandenstein spent most of the day making a 
series of small rocket burns that will bring the shuttle within 35 feet of the 
failing Long Duration Exposure Facility by 6:48 PST this morning. At that time, 
mission specialist Bonnie J. Dunbar will grapple it with the shuttle remote 
manipulator arm. 
</P>
<P>
The leaking water was discovered in mid-deck by Brandenstein early Thursday. 
The crew immediately switched to a backup dehumidifier and he and mission 
specialist G. David Low spent more than two hours cleaning up the water, which 
collected in large and small globules around the apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
The pair used towels and a vacuum hose to collect the water before it could 
damage sensitive electronic equipment, then dried cables and other apparatus by 
shining a flashlight on them. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the mid-deck mess in the middle of the cleanup, Brandenstein told 
Houston: "I'll get the plumber-of-the-year award, but not the 
housekeeper-of-the-year award." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, capsule communicator Frank Culbertson in Houston remarked that 
"it's a good thing those Navy boys have to go through Bilge Cleaning 101." 
Brandenstein is a Navy captain, pilot James D. Wetherbee a lieutenant 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials later said the dehumidifier had been clogged by lint and lithium 
hydroxide dust, but that the leak would not impair the shuttle's main mission: 
capture of the LDEF, which will crash into the atmosphere if not retrieved by 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
When the astronauts arose late Thursday night they were in roughly the same 
orbit as LDEF and about 390 nautical miles behind it. With the rocket firings 
Thursday, they expected to be about 50 nautical miles away when they wake up 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Another three computer controlled firings will bring them to within a few 
hundred feet of LDEF, at which time Brandenstein will take over the controls 
and manually fly the ship to within about 35 feet of the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia will fly underneath LDEF, then come up in front of the satellite with 
the ship perpendicular to the Earth and the payload bay doors pointing toward 
the satellite. This approach was chosen because it requires the least amount of 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
Once Columbia is close enough to LDEF, Dunbar will grasp it with the 
50-foot-long, $100-million remote manipulator arm and hold it for about 4.5

experiments aboard from the mid-deck area. Dunbar will then gently lower the 
satellite into a specially built cradle in the payload bay. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials anticipate no problems with loading the 12-ton, schoolbus-sized 
satellite into the cradle. In fact, when LDEF was deployed with the remote 
manipulator arm in 1984, the astronauts successfully tested reloading the 
satellite before finally releasing it into orbit.

The 10-day mission is scheduled to end next Friday with a 2:47 a.m. PST landing 
at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

CHINESE RETURN TO TIAN AN MEN SQUARE

Hundreds of Beijing residents streamed into Tian An Men Square on Thursday 
after martial law was lifted, but sporadic acts of defiance were quickly 
suppressed by police. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese expressed relief at the withdrawal of the widely hated martial-law 
troops who shot their way into the capital last June and since had sealed off 
the vast square and mounted armed patrols throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"At last, Tian An Men Square is back in the hands of the people," said one 
middle-aged worker on the 100-acre expanse of concrete that was occupied by 
protesting students from late April last year until the army moved in June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng on Wednesday announced the end of martial law, officially in 
force since May 20, 1989, and at the stroke of midnight troops and armed police 
marched off the square. 
</P>
<P>
With the ending of martial law, authorities placed the People's Armed Police 
throughout Beijing on maximum alert, an officer in the force said. Security 
personnel mingled with swelling crowds in Tian An Men Square, poised to pounce 
at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
They quickly moved in on one old man who began screaming at uniformed police 
preventing people from getting near the Monument to the People's Heroes, a tall 
obelisk in the center of the square. 
</P>
<P>
"The dead cannot be brought back to life and the living must not die," the man 
yelled, punching the air in a frenzy, apparently referring to those killed in 
the June army assault. 
</P>
<P>
Two people, apparently friends or relatives, restrained him, and police ran 
over to lead him away. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was detained by police after she gave an interview to a foreign 
television crew. 
</P>
<P>
A Beijing student who arrived at the square intent on pasting up a wallposter 
said he was scared off by tight security. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents were prohibited from laying wreaths at the monument, where 
deceased Chinese leaders are often mourned and which served as a headquarters 
for the student movement last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Although tough anti-protest laws and surveillance of university campuses remain 
in place, many expressed relief that martial law was over. "This is the way it 
should be," said a high school student about the opening of the square to the 
public again. 
</P>
<P>
But others, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the end of martial 
law will have little meaning as long as political repression continues. 
</P>
<P>
"The government draws a circle and you have to stand inside," said a Beijing 
teacher. "It's like the Russian gulag (labor camp), only a different size," he 
said, adding that "we haven't forgotten the students" who stood up to the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people were killed when troops stormed into 
the capital last June 3-4 to drive student demonstrators from the square. Since 
then, thousands of political activists have been arrested, and many languish in 
jail without formal charges.

PRIVATE OPERATOR SOUGHT FOR U.S. DRUG PROGRAM; UNION OBJECTS

The Justice Department is seeking a private firm to run a major anti-drug 
program and to coordinate federal attempts to curb juvenile crime, a move that 
"defies common sense," a government union charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the department would replace 48 government employees in the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention by signing a contract with a private firm to do their work. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ronald Reagan Administration tried on several occasions to 
eliminate the Office of Juvenile Justice by not requesting any funds for its 
operation, but Congress invariably stepped in to rescue the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another good way to destroy it," said Stu Smith, president of Local 
2830 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said 27 of the affected employees are social scientists, and eliminating 
those positions would wipe out more than 60% of the office's professional work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Post 
Office and Civil Service Committee that oversees the government's 
contracting-out program, challenged the proposal in a letter to Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Kanjorski said the employees who would be affected by the change were 
performing legitimate governmental functions. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Abell, assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice 
Programs, announced last week that the department would accept bids from 
private firms to do the work now performed by social science program 
specialists in the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Justice Assistance supervises the use of $446 million in funds 
for anti-drug operations by state and local governments as well as private 
groups. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has an annual 
budget of $72.5 million to finance its coordination of all federal youth 
program activities. 
</P>
<P>
In protesting the move, AFSCME Local 2830 said the two agencies make sure that 
government funds are spent according to Congress' specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees filling many of these positions . . . operate programs to teach 
law enforcement officers about child abuse, train juvenile court judges, help 
communities fight drug trafficking and coordinate the fight against crime with 
other government agencies," the union said. 
</P>
<P>
"To allow the private sector to take over such operations defies common sense 
and mocks the congressional intent of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and the 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention statutes. The intended or 
unintended result would be to destroy the integrity of two major government 
programs."

COCAINE USE FOUND IN 18.2% OF N. Y. TRAFFIC DEATHS

A study of 643 people killed in New York City traffic accidents shows that 
18.2% had used cocaine within 48 hours of the accident, researchers said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They said that of those 643, blood-alcohol and cocaine tests were available for 
378 drivers, and 56% had used one or both. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a national problem," the lead researcher, Dr. Peter M. Marzuk, 
said. "I think if you looked at driver fatalities in other large cities you 
might find relatively comparable results." 
</P>
<P>
Marzuk and his colleagues at Cornell University Medical College in New York 
City and at the New York City medical examiner's office looked at records of 
the 905 traffic fatalities of passengers or drivers from 1984 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriate autopsy findings were available for 643 of the traffic victims, and 
18.2% showed evidence of cocaine use within 48 hours before the accident, the 
researchers reported in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Among the drivers -- 70% of the 643 -- the prevalence of cocaine use was 20%. 
Of the drivers ages 16 to 45, the prevalence was 24.3%, the researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"That's high. That's the highest I've seen," said Steven Gust, a research 
psychologist with the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies had found prevalences ranging from 3% to 11%, he said, adding 
that there are regional differences in cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
The authors cautioned that their findings do not prove that cocaine use caused 
the accidents, but the study said that there are several reasons to suggest 
that cocaine might compromise driving ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Minutes after cocaine administration, users report feeling hyper-alert and 
euphoric but can also report aggressiveness, irritability, psychotic 
distortions and a tendency toward greater risk-taking," it said.

Albania, the last bastion of Stalinist communism in Eastern Europe, celebrated 
its national day Thursday, declaring that it has no need of Gorbachev-style 
reforms and denying reports of a crackdown on unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Communist Party newspaper, which Wednesday accused Albanian exiles 
of trying to foment a popular uprising and restore the monarchy, dismissed the 
perestroika reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"The prescriptions of the capitalist road, of perestroika and bourgeois 
reformism are unacceptable to our people and party," the daily Zeri i Popullit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An editorial marking the 44th anniversary of the founding of the republic said 
the Albanian people fully support the policies of Communist leader Ramiz Alia. 
</P>
<P>
"Our country develops and progresses relying completely on its own forces, 
being independent from the foreign powers or their economic, military and 
political blocs," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
The popular uprisings in the rest of Eastern Europe have left ultra-orthodox 
Albania isolated in its dogged pursuit of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Orthodox Church in neighboring Greece, meanwhile, warned the 
Albanian government that its present policies will lead to bloodshed and its 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"I am warning the Tirana regime the policy it has followed up to now will lead 
to international isolation and certain collapse," Archbishop Seraphim, the 
primate of the Orthodox Church in Greece, told a rally in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
After the rally, about 5,000 demonstrators marched through Athens chanting, 
"Stop the Murder Now," then went to the Albanian Embassy to demand immediate 
religious and political freedom in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Seraphim said the Albanian government must grant human rights immediately to 
its citizens "if it wishes to avoid bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 ethnic Greeks live in Albania, which has a population of around 3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Greek-Albanian relations have become increasingly tense since Greek Foreign 
Minister Antonis Samaras called for religious freedom last month.

The United States said a Soviet decision to upgrade its relations with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization is detrimental to Middle East peace efforts. 
The Kremlin announced Wednesday that it would allow the PLO's Moscow 
representation to be upgraded to an embassy. The decision by the Kremlin had 
been widely expected since November, 1988, when the Soviet Union recognized the 
PLO proclamation of a Palestinian state.

NEW PRESIDENT TAKES A HAMMER TO NORIEGA'S REDOUBT;

<P>
President Guillermo Endara, swinging a heavy sledgehammer, began the demolition 
Thursday of the Comandancia, the seat and symbol of Manuel A. Noriega's power. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good feeling to see a hated institution come down," Endara declared. 
"And it is good to see that housing for the poor will go up in its place." 
</P>
<P>
The hammer blows Endara delivered against a cement railing at the front of the 
building signaled the start of a two-month dismantling project that is to be 
followed by a multimillion-dollar public housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The Comandancia, built just after World War II, served many purposes, but after 
Noriega took power in 1981, its main purpose was to remind Panamanians of the 
control he exercised from his corner office on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
From the barred windows, Noriega could see the headquarters of his secret 
police and the warehouse-like building where agents known as sapos (toads) beat 
Noriega's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street were the barracks of the Machos de Montes, a special battalion 
of the Panama Defense Forces thought to be particularly loyal to Noriega and 
particularly brutal in carrying out his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few minutes in the early morning darkness of Dec. 20, the Comandancia 
and the other nearby symbols of power were all but destroyed. Their roofs were 
blown off, their walls raked by artillery and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The Comandancia was among the first important targets of invading U.S. troops, 
who used mortars, tanks and helicopter gunships in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
For a handful of foreign journalists who were brought to the Comandancia and 
abused one night last May, the sight of the wrecked compound provided feelings 
both of satisfaction and detachment. The buildings that had seemed so 
forbidding were now no more threatening than a child's playhouse, one said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Endara, Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon and other 
victims of Noriega's brutality took turns in hammering at the Comandancia. 
</P>
<P>
Harmodio Arias, whose father's newspapers were confiscated by the military 
rulers, looked on and commented: "Fantastic. I never imagined I would see this 
day, and I can't tell you in any language how this makes me feel." 
</P>
<P>
The Comandancia, an architectural oddity that was meant to be futuristic, did 
not fall easily to the U.S. weaponry, and it resisted the blows that fell on it 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so solid," Capt. Kirk Amundson of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. 
"We would have to use so much explosive to bring it down that the damage in the 
surrounding neighborhood would be unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Instead the walls will be brought down by wrecking balls, bulldozers, backhoes 
and men swinging 16-pound sledges. 
</P>
<P>
The weight of the hammer was almost too much for Endara. His first blow was on 
target, but the next went awry, and the flying debris it dislodged sent 
onlookers scurrying. Endara laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Arias grinned broadly as he delivered two strong blows directly 
on target, tearing out large chunks of material. 
</P>
<P>
Arias told the crowd: "It was an affront to have this in this neighborhood. Now 
we can use the money, the resources that were wasted on corruption, to build 
housing for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
The site is El Chorrillo, one of Panama City's poorest districts, and the 
shooting that destroyed Noriega's offices also destroyed several acres of slum 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under a plan drawn up by the military in 1981, the new government plans to 
construct apartments for 2,880 families. The land where the Comandancia stood 
will become a park called the Plaza of Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
To speed the project along, hundreds of people took part in Thursday's 
demolition ceremony. Chunks of walls were pulled loose and carried away. 
Plumbing fixtures were ripped out, along with floor coverings. 
</P>
<P>
The most sought-after souvenirs were documents, magazines, pamphlets and 
personal papers left by the soldiers, including a 1988 Christmas card to 
Noriega signed by the British military attache, Lt. Col. Robert Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
And there was a singed copy of a 1988 pamphlet complaining about U.S. influence 
all through Panama's history. Its title: "Panama, the Country Invaded by the 
United States."

REGULATORS CONFIRM BUSH'S SON WAS QUESTIONED IN THRIFT PROBE

<P>
Federal regulators said Thursday that the former chairman of Silverado Banking, 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has been penalized, and confirmed that one of 
President Bush's sons has been questioned in connection with the failure of the 
Colorado thrift. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision would not discuss the 
nature of the agency's recent discussions with Neil Bush, who served on 
Silverado's board from 1985 until August, 1988, a month before regulators 
seized the Denver institution. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been here a couple of times in the past week and a half," said OTS 
spokesman William Fulwider, who declined to confirm details of a Houston Post 
report that the President's son met for four hours Monday with OTS enforcement 
officer Rosemary Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Fulwider confirmed, however, that OTS officials are actively pursuing their 
investigation of Silverado, which was on the ropes financially when the 
government stepped in at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the questioning of Neil Bush could be interpreted as a signal 
that the President's son is a target of the investigation, Fulwider responded: 
"You can assume everybody in a senior position is likely to have been 
interviewed in one way or another, and that does not necessarily mean that any 
action is likely to be taken against them." 
</P>
<P>
The OTS announced Thursday that former Silverado Chairman and Chief Executive 
Michael R. Wise had signed a consent agreement barring him from entering into 
any working relationship with a federally insured financial institution without 
prior approval of federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar action Wednesday, the agency said that identical agreements had 
been signed by two other former Silverado directors, Richard K. Vandapool and 
Robert M. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three former officers admitted any wrongdoing. "Wise denied any 
wrongdoing and maintained that he had consented to avoid the time and expense 
that would be involved in litigating the case," the OTS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the latest enforcement action, the OTS cited its "grave concern 
about the soundness of Silverado's management in the months before its 
closing." 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that its concern focused on the danger of "too great a 
concentration of business in commercial loans in a depressed market" and "an 
exceptionally large number of problem transactions with related parties," a 
reference to so-called insider loans. 
</P>
<P>
James Monroney, a former staff analyst at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 
Topeka, Kan., has alleged that Silverado would have been taken over much sooner 
if Neil Bush had not been a board member. But Bush has denied those 
accusations.

There was no confirmation of ash in the plume, but it probably contained some,

Restoration of $24 million in state funds for family-planning clinics for the

The justices issued a stay, halting further proceedings, while they consider a 
challenge by the Deukmejian Administration to a lower-court ruling that would 
require release of the disputed money. The high court set no timetable for 
action in the case. The battle over funding began last summer when Gov. George 
Deukmejian, exercising his line-item veto powers, trimmed two-thirds of a 
$36-million appropriation for the clinics in the state budget.

Directors of the Calaveras County Fair have postponed a decision on allowing 
African Goliath frogs to compete in the annual frog-jumping contest after the 
state attorney general's office told them it would be illegal to meet in secret 
on the matter. Instead of a secret executive session Friday on a possible rules 
change that would ban the huge frogs from the contest, the directors will use 
the gathering to solicit public comment, said Diane Baumann of the 39th 
District Agricultural Assn., which hosts the May 17-20 contest. A Seattle man's 
plan to win the $1,500 in prize money by entering Goliath frogs, which are up 
to three feet long and reportedly can jump 30 feet or more in a bound, has 
attracted worldwide publicity to the contest, made famous in a Mark Twain short 
story.

Corona del Mar presented the medical clinic with $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The donation launches a campus-wide campaign that officials hope will bring in 
more than $200 million over the next few years. "This gift is most exciting 
because it assures the institute the funding necessary to remain at the 
forefront of laser biomedicine," said Dr. Michael Berns, the institute's 
director and co-founder. About $5.2 million of the donation will go toward the 
institute's research endowment, while the rest will complete a pledge made last 
year by the Beckman foundation to support new research positions.

GROWERS EXPRESS FEARS AND ANXIETY OVER MEDFLY WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN and ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California growers expressed heightened frustration and anxiety Thursday about 
Southern California's stubborn infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies, saying 
they particularly feared erosion of the public's acceptance of aerial pesticide 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Amid these concerns, state officials gloomily announced Thursday the discovery 
of another fly outside the 300-square-mile eradication zone. A mated female was 
found on Wednesday in Garden Grove, requiring an escalation of the spraying 
campaign into the Orange County community. 
</P>
<P>
Such discoveries have rattled the nerves of California's agricultural industry. 
Some growers, fearful that a fly may eventually make it over the Tehachapi 
Mountains, want to ensure early detection by increasing the number of Medfly 
traps in the farm-rich San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although growers said they remain confident the state can eventually eradicate 
the pest, they are uneasy about government's year-after-year failure to keep 
the insect out of California. In Southern California, aerial spraying to combat 
the Medfly has been required in 1980, 1981, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1989 and now in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anything that is discouraging, it is the frequency, the number of 
times that the Medfly has been reintroduced to California," said Bob Krauter, 
spokesman for the California Farm Bureau. "It's just frustrating for farmers to 
see that we have another Medfly introduction." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Durando, president of the California Grape and Tree Fruit League, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer it takes to eradicate and the more often we become re-infested -- 
whatever the region of the state -- citizens probably become more skeptical and 
thereby lose their will to get in and attack the problem," Durando said. 
</P>
<P>
Durando said his organization contacts officials at the California Department 
of Food and Agriculture on an almost daily basis to press them to continue to 
wage an aggressive eradication campaign. So far, the league and other growers' 
groups are satisfied that the state is doing all it can. 
</P>
<P>
"Growers are anxious, particularly those who are well versed on the issue, 
because they understand the potential for damage to our industry," Durando 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Magee, associate director of the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said his agency feels pressure not from agriculture, but from 
public officials whose constituents are unhappy about pesticide spraying over 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always concerned about the public opinion of your program, and 
certainly spraying over the top of them is not going to make most people feel 
very comfortable," Magee said. "I don't have any other choice now." 
</P>
<P>
Some growers, admitting they naively assumed aerial spraying would be accepted 
by Southern Californians, say they are now scared that opposition might curtail 
the eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sarabian, whose family owns a fruit and nut farm in Fresno, said he did 
not appreciate the depth of public concern over aerial spraying until he read 
recently about an anonymous claim that flies have been released deliberately to 
halt eradication efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It became obvious there are people who are forcefully against spraying," he 
said. "They stop spraying, and we would be in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Government agricultural officials originally believed the current infestation 
could be contained with a single application of malathion and the release of 
sterile flies, which are used to breed fertile flies out of existence. But the 
infestation proved to be more widespread than thought, and the effort quickly 
exhausted all available sterile flies. Officials now plan to apply pesticides 
over each infested neighborhood a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding anxiety among growers and the general public are newly expressed 
doubts by some scientists that the fly can be eradicated soon, if at all, from 
Southern California. Durando said he wishes these scientists would keep their 
opinions to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it demoralizes the effort and confuses the issue," Durando said, 
adding apologetically, "That is a selfish statement I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
Most growers and agricultural officials blame the public for the infestations. 
The flies are believed to have reached California through fruit shipped in the 
mail or brought back in luggage from places where the insect is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason all this is happening is we are not doing enough at entry points," 
complained Carl Lindgren, an Irvine-based citrus and vegetable grower. "The 
average person who brings in Medflies might not even know they are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
State agricultural officials, mindful of such complaints, will soon announce a 
grower-financed $10,000 reward for any information leading to the prosecution 
of individuals who bring quarantined produce to California. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have been haggling with the U.S. Postal Service for months over 
the entry into California of packages containing infested fruit. The state 
wants to be able to open suspicious packages sent through first-class mail, but 
postal officials fear such inspections could violate constitutional 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
Second-, third- or fourth-class mail can be opened for inspection. To determine 
how much infested fruit may be entering this way, state officials are planning 
to send packages of treated fruit susceptible to Medflies to California from 
various parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll know how many we send and how many get through, and then we can start 
having some meetings with these people to tighten things up," said Magee. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists who believe repeated aerial spraying campaigns are wasteful and 
potentially harmful contend the state must begin to plan for ways to cope with 
an endemic Medfly population. 
</P>
<P>
But growers applauded the state for failing to undertake such planning, fearing 
it would divert resources away from eradication efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Living with the Medfly "is not an option, period," said Durando. "A scientist 
might think so, but his income does not depend on growing and shipping a crop." 
</P>
<P>
If the fly became endemic, growers said, they would lose their export markets 
or be forced to undertake costly treatment of fruit that would drive up its 
price and potentially reduce its quality. The state's fruit crop is worth at 
least $1.5 billion annually, with exports in 1988 totaling $429 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always concern, but they've always been able to keep things in check," 
said Sarabian, the Fresno grower. "But this seems to be a nagging one. They 
find one fly here and then another one there. It's not localized. This is not 
typical. It's gotten everyone confused."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTION PAVES WAY FOR NEW POLICE SUBSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved an agreement that paves the way for a 
police substation to open in Chinatown later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The city Police Department will operate the substation at a facility owned by 
the Chinatown Public Safety Assn., a nonprofit group organized by local Chinese 
citizens eight years ago to bring a permanent substation to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The safety group is building a $980,000 two-story facility at 823 N. Hill St., 
with $681,000 in grants and loans from the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency, and public donations. A Chinatown police service center has operated 
out of a donated office since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The association will lease 1,500 square feet of office space and five parking 
spaces to the Police Department for $1 a year for 10 years.

BILL BOYARSKY: A GOOD CASE FOR VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BIll Boyarsky 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it was unintentional, Supervisor Pete Schabarum made a convincing case 
for the Voting Rights Act when he testified Tuesday in the federal government's 
redistricting lawsuit against Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum doesn't like the Voting Rights Act, enacted by President Lyndon B. 
Johnson and Congress in 1965 to assure that minorities are represented in 
government. He made that clear on Tuesday. A cold had turned his voice into a 
hoarse growl and eliminated any trace of humor from a man who snarls even on 
his good days. The fact that he was being questioned by a type he can't stand 
-- a liberal ACLU lawyer -- made his mood even worse. 
</P>
<P>
But as he answered questions for four hours, his words were most enlightening. 
They added up to a solid argument for applying the act here. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, along with the American Civil Liberties Union and the 
Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, says county supervisors violated the 
Voting Rights Act when, in 1981, they drew the boundaries that define today's 
five supervisorial districts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the supervisors deliberately scattered the county's 
growing Latino population among the districts to prevent election of a Latino 
to the board. They did this, the lawsuit charges, to preserve the jobs of the 
incumbents -- all of them Anglos -- and to assure continued control of the 
board by its conservative majority. 
</P>
<P>
As Schabarum answered questions by ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum, his views on 
Latinos became very clear: They should make it on their own, just like everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, something else became just as clear: Schabarum knew nothing -- and had 
no interest in learning -- of the problems in large areas of his district where 
some of the county's poorest Latinos live. Conditions there are so bad that few 
can make it on their own. These people need representation at the highest 
levels of government so they can get a fairer share of an admittedly small 
public pie. 
</P>
<P>
His ignorance, or lack of interest in these conditions, pointed up the reason 
why the Voting Rights Act, passed by Democrats, has been enforced by subsequent 
Democratic and Republican administrations. All have agreed that unwilling state 
and local governments must be forced to give minorities a place at the 
decision-making table. In fact, the suit against the county was filed by the 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's making-it-on-their-own philosophy came out indirectly when he was 
talking about his only Latino deputy, Sarah Flores. 
</P>
<P>
He could not have picked a more admirable person to be a symbol for his views. 
Sarah Flores has definitely made it on her own. Starting as a low-ranked 
secretary in the office of Schabarum's predecessor, she worked her way up to 
chief secretary. Recognizing her ability, Schabarum made her a deputy, and now 
she's his assistant chief deputy. In the Hall of Administration, a 
strong-minded deputy like Flores can be more powerful than a department head. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone has her intelligence, toughness, strong family background and 
good fortune. In the poorest parts of Schabarum's district, the immigrant 
barrios of Southeast Los Angeles County, economic, social, educational, even 
health barriers prevent people from making it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's disinterest in these areas became clear under Rosenbaum's 
questioning. The supervisor knew only one community organization operating in 
Hispanic areas, the United Neighborhood Organizations, born in Eastside 
Catholic parish houses and now a powerful community voice. He spoke of UNO with 
contempt. "I have difficulty in communicating with a group of Catholic clergy 
who have taken upon themselves a political role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hageman, his field deputy for those areas, speaks no Spanish, Schabarum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hageman is a conscientious public servant. But I, as a non-Spanish speaking 
reporter, have been in the health clinics in Southeast county barrios, where 
women and children wait in extended lines for treatment or examinations. I 
can't find out what's going on. The county health workers won't talk. That 
leaves the patients as the only source of real information. And Hageman, not 
speaking Spanish, is cut off from them. 
</P>
<P>
That's a very basic example of the harm done by denial of political 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody argues that financially strapped local governments will be able to solve 
all the problems of the minority poor. But in the city of Los Angeles, after a 
similar Justice Department suit increased Latino representation, services have 
improved in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
In his long morning on the witness stand, Schabarum showed why the Justice 
Department, through conservative and liberal administrations, has found it 
necessary to insist on continued obedience to the Voting Rights Act.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCDONALD'S TO OFFER DISCOUNTS TO HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonald's Corp. has volunteered to provide discounted Big Macs and other 
fast-food meals to homeless families enrolled in the city's emergency shelter 
and voucher program, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's, which will be reimbursed by the city, will provide 4,000 meal 
coupons for distribution by nine social service agencies involved in the city's 
program of offering hotel vouchers to homeless families whenever temperatures 
dip below 40 degrees, or under 50 degrees when rain is likely. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is an innovative approach," Bradley said at a news conference at 
the downtown Chicana Service Action Center, one of the nine facilities for 
coupon distribution. "It is one of the ways in which other food service 
corporations in this community can serve their social consciousness," Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Hogan, a spokesman for McDonald's, said the program was a first for the 
company in Southern California.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 85, RAPED, BEATEN TO DEATH IN BED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy on an 85-year-old woman, who died at a Van Nuys nursing home, 
revealed that she was raped and beaten to death in her bed, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Libbie Noble, who had lived at the retirement home only 10 days, was found dead 
at 7 a.m. Sunday at the Valley View Retirement Center in the 7700 block of 
Woodman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
When the body was found, police saw blood on the pillow and noted a facial 
bruise on the woman. Because she was known to have dizzy spells and used a 
walker, detectives initially believed she might have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
But because Noble's nightgown was pulled up and a blanket had been pulled off 
the bed, police ordered the autopsy, which found evidence of sexual assault. 
Cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma to the head. She had been 
struck hard enough to knock loose a tooth.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTHERN PACIFIC TO PAY $7,000 IN ASBESTOS 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. was ordered Thursday to pay $7,050 in fines 
and penalties after being convicted of illegally demolishing a building 
containing asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The fines were imposed by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Owen Lee Kwong after 
Southern Pacific attorneys pleaded no contest to three violations of a state 
Health and Safety Code section that makes it a misdemeanor to fail to comply 
with federal regulations in the handling of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Donald Kass said the charges stemmed from the Oct. 5, 1988, 
razing of a single-story building near Southern Pacific headquarters adjacent 
to the Los Angeles River and Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The demolition was carried out by Cal Pacific, a Huntington Park company that 
pleaded no contest in the case last October and was fined $2,350.

<P>
Sheriff's officials on Thursday released a 21-year-old unemployed Norwalk man 
who had been arrested as part of the investigation into a series of rapes and 
break-ins in a Norwalk neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Ross was arrested by deputies Tuesday morning in the four-block area 
where three rapes, an attempted rape and several break-ins have occurred since 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who was wandering around the neighborhood when he was spotted by 
deputies, who thought he resembled the suspect described by witnesses, Lt. 
Ronald T. Wagner said. However, none of the victims or witnesses could identify 
Ross, and there was no other evidence that he had committed any crime, Wagner

AQMD URGES BAN ON REFINERY USAGE OF TOXIC CHEMICAL; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: STAFF MEMBERS SURPRISE AND PLEASE TORRANCE CITY OFFICIALS BY SUGGESTING 
A BAN ON HYDROGEN FLUORIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District staff members disclosed Thursday 
that they will propose a ban on refinery use of the highly toxic chemical 
hydrogen fluoride. 
</P>
<P>
The staff decision was contained in a brief memo to members of a hydrogen 
fluoride task force, which was created to study the dangers that use of the 
chemical poses to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a ban brought cheers from Torrance city officials, who had 
been outraged by a draft report done for the task force. It had recommended 
additional safety measures instead of a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Startled refinery officials questioned why district staff would come to a 
conclusion so different from the draft conclusions of the district's own task 
force, which is composed of 45 government, industry and public safety 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the dangers of earthquakes, sabotage and human error, the memo by deputy 
executive officer Edward Camarena said "the life-threatening consequences" of a 
hydrogen fluoride spill led the staff to conclude that it would be "prudent 
public policy to phase out the use of this acutely hazardous material where 
viable" and less dangerous chemicals are available. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeahhhh!" said Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, who is sponsoring a March 
ballot initiative that would force the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance to stop 
using hydrogen fluoride. "That's just great." 
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen fluoride, known in its liquid state as hydrofluoric acid, is used at 
four Los Angeles area refineries as a catalyst in the production of unleaded 
gasoline. The chemical also is used at Allied-Signal Corp. in El Segundo to 
manufacture refrigerants. 
</P>
<P>
If spilled, the chemical creates a deadly gas cloud. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries could use sulfuric acid instead, but they would have to spend 
millions of dollars and several years building new equipment to make the 
conversion. No other chemical could be substituted at Allied-Signal, said 
officials of both the company and the air quality district. 
</P>
<P>
The district staff's recommendation and the task force report, which will be 
finalized in coming weeks, will be considered by the full AQMD board at a March 
2 meeting. If the AQMD decides to limit hydrogen fluoride use, state 
legislation implementing the ban would then have to be approved in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena said the staff's decision was based largely on a computerized study -- 
not yet released to the public -- of how spills of hydrogen fluoride and its 
alternative, sulfuric acid, would affect an urbanized area. Release of the 
study is expected early next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that there cannot be absolute guarantees against certain events 
-- earthquake, human error, things of that nature -- and one needs to then ask, 
are there risks that we can avoid by seeking viable alternatives?" Camarena 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said the computer study will provide valuable 
scientific support for her city's pending lawsuit against Mobil, which seeks 
additional power to regulate the refinery by having it declared a public 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting for this. This is very good news," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Refinery officials said they had assumed that the district's staff 
recommendation would parallel the task force's draft report. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a surprise to me. I was not aware that they had undertaken any 
(computer) modeling," said Mobil refinery general manager Wyman Robb, a 
non-voting industry member of the task force. Mobil's own modeling studies 
showed little danger of a fatality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent months and months and months tuning the fairly sophisticated models 
on hydrogen fluoride dispersion," Robb said. "I don't know how long they've 
been working on this. . . . There's more information that I need to see before 
I can make any comment about that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil uses an average of 459 gallons of hydrofluoric acid each day. Robb 
estimated that it would cost more than $100 million and take three to four 
years to convert to sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Equally surprised by the decision were officials at two Santa Fe Springs 
refineries -- Powerine Oil Company, which uses 73 gallons per day, and Golden 
West Refinery, which uses 81 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Refinery manager Marshall A. (Bud) Bell of Ultramar Refinery in Wilmington, 
which needs a daily supply of 283 gallons, said that the initial cost of 
converting to sulfuric acid would be about $45 million. He said operating costs 
would also be higher. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be devastating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Thursday, Ultramar, which has the region's second 
largest alkylation unit using hydrofluoric acid, released a risk assessment 
report that estimates that their use of the chemical would cause one death 
every 100 years. The estimate is about the same as one that Mobil came up with 
in a similar risk assessment report. 
</P>
<P>
Ultramar's study, Bell said, proves that the firm's use of hydrogen fluoride is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
At Allied-Signal, which leads usage in Los Angeles with 4,320 gallons consumed 
each day, officials were generally not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't really impact us here because they're talking about viable 
alternatives, and it's already been established that we don't have any," acting 
plant manager John Haddad said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Allied-Signal uses hydrogen fluoride to make refrigerants that are less 
dangerous to the ozone layer than other types of refrigerants, Camarena said 
air quality district staff members will have to balance that positive 
consideration with the toxic dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"One needs to crank all the considerations into coming up with a 
recommendation," he said. "Where there aren't alternatives, then that pretty 
well answers that." 
</P>

<P>
DEVELOPMENT: BUILDER GOES AHEAD WITH PAVING DESPITE REFUSAL OF A COASTAL 
COMMISSION PERMIT. THEN HE ASKS THE PANEL TO APPROVE THE COMPLETED ROAD. IT DID 
NOT.

<P>
When real estate developer Charles Tarrats began paving a twisting, 2 1/2-mile 
road in Malibu's pristine upper Ramirez Canyon without a permit last May, the 
state Coastal Commission ordered him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
He did -- for two days. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Coastal Commission turned down his request for an emergency permit. 
Regardless, Tarrats' workmen returned to finish the road that area 
environmentalists scorned as an "abomination" on the Santa Monica Mountains 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shortcomings critics find in Tarrats, they cannot fault him for a lack 
of tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a lawyer for the Malibu real estate broker asked the Coastal 
Commission for after-the-fact approval of the same road-paving project that 
state law enforcement officials have accused Tarrats and his partners of 
carrying out illegally. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the 12-member panel denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
However, few of the dozen people who testified at the Coastal Commission's 
meeting in opposition to Tarrats' request were ready to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the road's still there, the damage has been done," resident Bill 
Brackenridge said. "It won't be time to bring out the champagne until they rip 
that road completely out." 
</P>
<P>
He and others complain that the asphalt road, which winds as high as 2,000 feet 
into the hills between Kanan Dume Road and Latigo Canyon Road, threatens to 
speed development in the largely unspoiled area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
They insist that the road is poorly built and dangerous, and that its 
construction resulted in the unlawful destruction of several plant and animal 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy waiting to happen," area resident Matt Clark said. "No 
engineering went into it. It's only a matter of time before there is a severe 
traffic accident up there. And the way it was built, it won't be long before it 
starts to fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
What becomes of the unpopular roadway may depend on the outcome of a lawsuit 
the state attorney general's office filed against more than 40 Malibu property 
owners, headed by Tarrats, who allegedly pooled their money to pave it. The 
state is asking for millions of dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing, attorney Joseph Gughemetti offered what may be a preview 
of the argument that Tarrats and the others may present if, and when, the 
lawsuit -- filed last July in Los Angeles Superior Court -- comes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gughemetti said Tarrats ignored the stop-work papers served on him last May and 
continued paving what had been two contiguous roads in the belief that he was 
not violating any laws. 
</P>
<P>
"My client's paving was predicated on already having a county permit to do the 
work. He was not aware that Coastal Commission approval was needed," Gughemetti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the argument did not impress many of the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"These applications have been around for years. . . . The real estate brokers 
(who do business within the five-mile coastal zone) know about the Coastal 
Act," Commissioner Dorill Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Tarrats declined to be interviewed, referring questions to 
Gughemetti. Although he attended the hearing, Tarrats did not testify. He sat 
behind his lawyer, clutching a Bible during much of the three-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last year, he denied that the 20-foot-wide road was built to 
speed development in the area, saying that the property owners who contributed 
to the project just wanted to improve access to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, opponents say he has tried to capitalize on the new road access. 
The road was featured in an advertisement placed by Tarrats' company last 
summer in an edition of the Malibu Homes directory, which listed a 24-acre 
property in upper Ramirez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The ad said: "A beautiful private park-like setting with close proximity to 
Pacific Coast Highway and easy access off a newly paved road. . . . There is 
room for all amenities. $795,000." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Gughemetti insisted that his client has never been interested in trying to 
develop the property, saying that Tarrats is only interested in building a home 
on the site.

LANDING STRIP FOR SHUTTLE SINKING FROM USE OF WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
WATER: OFFICIALS SAY GROWTH IN ANTELOPE VALLEY HAS INCREASED PUMPING, WHICH HAS 
CAUSED THE LAKE BED AT EDWARDS TO SUBSIDE AS MUCH AS THREE FEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The dry lake runways at Edwards Air Force Base, famous as the landing ground of 
the space shuttles, are cracking and sinking, apparently because the Antelope 
Valley's growing population is sucking ground water from beneath them, federal 
officials reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing by the California Water Commission in Lancaster, officials of 
the Air Force and the U.S. Geological Survey said they believe development 
there and in nearby Palmdale had led to lower ground water levels, causing the 
soil under the air base to settle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very obvious ground water pumpage throughout the Antelope Valley is 
having an impact on the subsidence at Edwards Air Force Base," said John Klein, 
district chief of the survey's water resources division. The agency is 
conducting a five-year, $6-million study of the problem and other water-use 
issues for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the base's 44-square-mile Rogers Dry Lake bed, used by space 
shuttles and "The Right Stuff" test pilots, are believed to have subsided as 
much as three feet. Air Force officials said the lake bed is broken by fissures 
up to 3 feet wide, 2 feet deep and hundreds of feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and Air Force officials told the commission that the subsidence problem 
at the base, as well as a related drinking water shortage there, could worsen 
unless, in Klein's words, "major steps are taken to limit further withdrawals" 
of ground water in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so serious that the Air Force has been able to continue using 
the clay runways only by using up to 10 people full time to fill in the cracks. 
"We're seeing severe cracks throughout the whole lake bed," but the Air Force 
will be able to continue using the lake bed as a runway as long as repairs are 
kept up, said Col. Peter Walsh, the base's civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Located about 35 miles northeast of Lancaster, Edwards is home of the Air 
Force's famed Flight Test Center and is the second-largest Air Force base in 
the continental United States, covering about 300,000 acres, officials said. 
The entire region gets its water from the same underground source. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the population of the Antelope Valley has nearly 
doubled from 100,000 to almost 200,000 and water use has climbed. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials stressed that they were not calling for a slowdown of 
residential development in the region. Instead, they asked that the area's 
water agencies shift away from ground water and instead use more supplies from 
the California Aqueduct, which carries water from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The region already gets about 40% to 50% of its water from the State Water 
Project's aqueduct, said Wallace Spinarski, general manager of the Antelope 
Valley/East Kern Water Agency. But that supply has not been secure, 
particularly during droughts, and officials have also relied on local ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the ground water level at Edwards has dropped from about 10 feet 
below the surface in 1948 to a recent level of about 100 feet below. But Klein 
said it is difficult to tell how much of the decline is attributable to the 
rapid growth of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials first noticed the problem several years ago, Walsh said, 
and "the rate of subsidence is increasing . . . as the rate of withdrawal from 
the aquifer increases." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ground water pumping, Klein said, massive development in the 
Lancaster-Palmdale area also appears to have contributed to Edwards' water 
problem by blocking rainfall from reaching formerly open areas, shifting the 
underground water flow away from Edwards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the base "a national asset," Walsh said the Antelope Valley region 
needs to develop a comprehensive water management plan that would address the 
need to preserve the area's ground water. That presumably would halt further 
damage to the base's dry lake bed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the base's only problem. During the past summer, the facility 
was plagued by a drinking water shortage and had to adopt strict conservation 
measures because many of its ground water wells, the base's only water supply 
for now, had to be shut down, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine wells have been closed, three because of natural arsenic contamination and 
the others because of aging equipment and declining water flow, Walsh said. 
Twelve remaining wells should carry the base through low water use months until 
this summer.

GANG-RELATED KILLINGS IN COUNTY, CITY SET RECORD IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang-related killings in Los Angeles County skyrocketed to a record 570 in 
1989, outstripping 1988's total of 452, according to estimates released 
Thursday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police reported that an unprecedented 303 people were slain in 
gang-related killings in the city last year, a nearly 18% increase over the 
record 257 slayings logged in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Wes McBride said there were 116 gang-related slayings in 1989 in 
unincorporated areas of the county and in cities patrolled by the Sheriff's 
Department -- also an all-time high -- surpassing 1988's record of 96 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials partly blamed the rise in gang-related slayings on a 
worsening drug war between the region's street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials define gang-related slayings as killings in which either the 
assailant or the victim is a gang member. These homicides do not necessarily 
result from gang activity. A more limited category, gang-motivated homicides, 
includes only those killings stemming directly from gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
That category usually yields lower totals, but those figures were not available 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of push and pull for drug locations," said an LAPD anti-gang 
officer who asked that he not be identified. "It's like the Prohibition Era. 
We've got a mini-Chicago here." 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Fred Nixon said a portion of the increase in gang slayings was due 
to the growth of police files that list known gang members, enabling 
investigators to more easily identify which victims belong to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 600 gangs with 70,000 members in Los Angeles County, according 
to law enforcement estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also estimate that there are about 25,000 members making up about 
260 so-called sets of the Bloods and Crips, the city's two largest primarily 
black gangs. There are also between 40,000 and 50,000 Latino gang members,. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in gang-related slayings, the killings do not appear to 
account for a larger proportion of all homicides, Nixon said. The number of 
gang-related killings in the city increased 17.9% in 1989 while the overall 
number of slayings increased at nearly the same pace, up 17.2%, from 745 deaths 
in 1988 to 873 deaths in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, too, cited drugs as a chief reason for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be foolish to ignore the influence that narcotics trafficking has on 
our crime statistics, particularly on homicide stats," he said. "We know, for 
instance, that more than half of the homicides that we've seen in the 1980s 
were somehow related to drug abuse or drug trafficking. We certainly attribute 
a lot of these numbers to the scourge of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about turf wars to protect drug markets; we're talking about 
people committing crimes while under the influence, and people committing 
crimes to get money to purchase drugs."

ONE SUIT FILED, ANOTHER OKD TO OPPOSE PRISONS

Although Los Angeles County contributes about 40% of the state's prison 
population, local officials in two separate actions Thursday opposed proposed 
state prisons for an industrial area near the Civic Center and in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying through on their threats, Los Angeles city officials and Eastside 
activists filed a lawsuit in the morning to block construction of a 1,450-bed 
facility on a 20-acre site next to the Los Angeles River. Later in the day, the 
county Board of Supervisors voted to sue to block a similar facility on 
county-owned land in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants these prisons," explained urban planner Frank Villalobos, head of 
a Latino coalition that opposes the downtown prison next to the Los Angeles 
River at Santa Fe Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there are no state prisons in the county. The two proposed sites 
were part of a delicate compromise worked out in the Legislature several years 
ago. They were linked after Democratic lawmakers from Los Angeles complained 
that Republican constituents in rural parts of the county ought to accept equal 
share of the prison burden. 
</P>
<P>
Under a legislative compromise, neither prison could be occupied until 
construction is begun on the other. 
</P>
<P>
But that did little to quell opposition to either proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, for example, is but 
the latest move in the five-year fight against the prison by Latino activists 
and others who contend that Eastside neighborhoods have more than their share 
of jails. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the state Department of Corrections violated state guidelines by 
ignoring environmental considerations concerning the proposed prison. Although 
an environmental impact report was approved for the site, the suit argued that 
the EIR was inadequate because it ignored the impact on the character and 
social fabric of the surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said state planners also failed to study possible soil contamination 
from toxics in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of SB18, the compromise bill that 
authorized the two prison sites in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"By authorizing two different prisons, neither one of which could be passed 
without the other in the same legislation, passage of this bill . . . 
constituted classic 'logrolling,' in violation of the California Constitution," 
the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections said she regretted the 
lawsuit's filing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that the city of Los Angeles did not see fit to work with 
us on this much-needed project," spokeswoman Christine May said from 
Sacramento. "We feel confident that the environmental impact report will pass 
any scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, a longtime prison foe, said it hurt her to 
review the 113-page lawsuit as it was filed in the downtown County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very painful because, as I'm reading it, I'm reliving all of those 
years of protests against it," she said. "It's painful to see the utter 
disregard for this community, which doesn't want this prison." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres, Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard and City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, all local Democrats, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The county supervisors, on a 3-0 vote, agreed to sue the state to block the 
Lancaster prison at the urging of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who termed as 
"frivolous" the lawsuit against the downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor said he opposes the Mira Loma site in Lancaster because the 
county has owned the 232-acre parcel of land for 42 years and now needs it to 
provide the fast-growing Antelope Valley with expanded hospital, police 
protection, probation, animal care and other services. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the places, they picked the one owned by the county for 42 years," 
Antonovich said. He said the state's acquisition of that site for a prison 
would amount to "double taxation," in that county taxpayers would have to pay 
for land to replace the Mira Loma site, which is located at Avenue J and 60th 
Street West in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich would not say when a suit would be filed by the county, which can 
legally challenge the prison environmental impact report until Jan. 29. He and 
fellow Supervisor Deane Dana suggested that the state move the prison to 
state-owned property in Hungry Valley, a remote area west of I-5 and south of 
Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster City Council last week voted to authorize a lawsuit to block the 
Mira Loma prison site but has not yet filed it.

PETITIONS AGAINST TRACT REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
WESTLAKE VILLAGE: OPPONENTS OF A MAJOR PROJECT SUFFER A SETBACK. OFFICIALS SAY 
THEY FAILED TO INCLUDE THE TEXT OF LAWS THAT ARE TARGETED. 
</P>

<P>
Westlake Village officials have rejected petitions filed by a citizens group 
seeking to overturn approval of the largest development project in the town's 
history, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Michael Jenkins said the petitions were invalid because they lacked 
the text of the targeted city ordinances, as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
After the City Council approved the Westlake North residential and commercial 
project on Dec. 6, the group began circulating the petitions in an attempt to 
force the council to reverse its decision or put the issue to a binding public 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the petition deadline last week, the group submitted 681 
signatures, considerably more than the 483 needed to require the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North was approved under two ordinances that form a stack of documents 
about an inch thick. The group's petitions contained a brief synopsis of the 
ordinances, but courts have interpreted state election law as requiring the 
laws' full text so that signers may "see what it is they are protesting 
against," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North would be built on 129 acres north of the Ventura Freeway and 
Lindero Canyon Road. It would include 250 apartments or condominiums and a 
1.4-million-square-foot commercial center with four-story buildings. The 
developer, Westlake Village Associates, has agreed to preserve the town's golf 
course and to pay millions of dollars for street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group objects to the project's size and the traffic it would 
generate. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach leaders of the group were unsuccessful Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement mailed to the news media last week, the group said it was 
"flabbergasted when the city staff seemingly tried to go out of its way to find 
minor procedural flaws with our submitted petitions. 
</P>
<P>
". . . . We are more than confident that everyone that signed the petition was 
aware of this project, and they felt that the major issues associated with it 
needed to be voted upon."

LIBRARY BOARD SAYS IT CAN'T FUND EXPANSION IN STUDIO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city library commissioners said Thursday they do not have $1.6 
million in their budget to buy land to expand the crowded Studio City branch 
library, but they encouraged a homeowners group and Councilman Michael Woo's 
office to explore other sources of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City Residents Assn. and Woo's office previously had urged the 
Library Commission to buy a 19,000-square-foot vacant lot at the northwest 
corner of Moorpark Street and Whitsett Avenue to expand the library next door. 
The library has 58,000 books, twice its designed capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Library Commission President Martha Katsufrakis told the group that the 
department does not have money for the purchase. The property, owned by Tony 
Dell'Acqua, has been appraised at $1.6 million by city officials. It was 
previously the site of a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
However, Katsufrakis and Commissioner Doug Ring, a real estate attorney, urged 
the homeowner group to seek creative ways to fund the project. Ring suggested 
that local developers might contribute to a library expansion fund if the 
homeowner group in return lobbied city officials for their projects. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also turned down an appeal from residents association board 
member Jerry Kurland to change the commission's master plan to identify the 
Moorpark-Whitsett parcel as the preferred site for expansion of the Studio City 
branch library. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan currently envisions moving the library to Ventura Boulevard 
when funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Gaines, attorney for the association, said revising the master plan would 
help the group persuade Dell'Acqua not to sell the property to another party. 
The owner has been amenable to the association's requests that he first 
consider selling to the city, but it is uncertain how long he will wait, Gaines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, a deputy to Woo, who represents the area where the library 
is located, joined the homeowner group in seeking commission support for the 
purchase. Brueggemann noted that Woo's office had received a petition signed by 
1,300 residents urging that the Moorpark-Whitsett site be used for library 
expansion.

GARDENA CHECKS RESTAURANTS THAT MAY BE BARS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: GARDENA OFFICIALS ASK STATE TO INVESTIGATE TWO RESTAURANTS 
SUSPECTED OF VIOLATING THEIR LIQUOR LICENSES BY NOT OFFERING BONA FIDE MEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gardena city officials have asked the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control to investigate whether two restaurants are violating their liquor 
licenses and are operating as bars. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they want to find out if the Kyoto and Nami restaurants, both on 
Western Avenue, have curtailed or shut down their kitchen operations and are 
concentrating on serving drinks. Both restaurants are licensed by the state 
agency to serve alcohol as long as they are also serving bona fide meals, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mas Fukai, who said he had received complaints from other restaurant 
owners that the restaurants were operating illegally, raised the issue at 
Tuesday's council meeting when both restaurants came before the council for 
entertainment permit renewals. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Hayashi, owner of Kyoto, told the council that the management has had 
difficulty finding and retaining Japanese cooks, but that food is available in 
the dining area of the restaurant and at a sushi bar downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Through an interpreter, the owner of Nami, Moon Kyeong Koh, told the council 
that her restaurant serves Korean and Japanese home-style meals as well as 
alcoholic drinks, but that meals account for less than 50% of her business. 
Moon said she is trying to advertise the menu in Japanese- and Korean-language 
newspapers to increase the restaurant clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Fukai asked Gardena City Manager Kenneth Landau to request the state 
investigation, and Landau said Thursday that the request had been made. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Fukai said there appears to be a trend among some restaurants 
in Gardena and elsewhere -- particularly Japanese and Korean establishments -- 
to start out as full-fledged restaurants and then convert into more lucrative 
Asian hostess bars, serving only light appetizers or sushi but earning most of 
their money from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"I notice most of these are people who come from Korea and Japan, opening up a 
restaurant and calling it a restaurant, and they turn it into a bar" even 
though their license does not permit it, Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>
Fukai said two or three other restaurants in the city may be violating their 
liquor licenses, and that the city may ask the state to investigate them when 
their entertainment permits come up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Emanuel Espinoza, chief deputy director of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control, said the agency issues two types of licenses, Type 47 for restaurants 
and Type 48 for bars. State law defines restaurants as places "that regularly 
and in a bona fide manner are used and kept open for the serving of meals to 
guests for compensation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants serving only light meals, such as sandwiches or salads, would not 
be eligible for a restaurant liquor license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to serve hot dogs and potato chips and operate with a microwave, 
that's not going to make it either," Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Suspected violations are given high priority, Espinoza said. "If it comes to 
our attention, we get on it right away." Penalties could include suspension or 
revocation of the license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, the council voted to renew the entertainment permits for 
both Nami and Kyoto but set a condition that the restaurants must serve full 
meals. In addition to the state investigation, Landau said, city officials will 
inspect both restaurants over the next two months to confirm whether they are 
selling meals. If they are not, the city could suspend or revoke the 
entertainment permits, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In their permit renewal applications, both establishments said they offer live 
piano music and patron dancing as entertainment, and Kyoto also listed a 
popular form of Japanese entertainment called karaoke, or singing along with 
recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena residents and city officials have traditionally taken a strong stance 
against the sale of alcohol. The city passed an ordinance about five years ago 
requiring new business owners who plan to sell liquor to apply for a 
conditional-use permit, Landau said. Since then, the city has granted such 
permits only for bona fide eating establishments and not for bars, he said.

SERVICES, DANCING, SINGING AMONG EVENTS HONORING MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY

<P>
Korean dancers, a choir of singers from seven churches and a student drill team 
will highlight Martin Luther King Day events in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers and choir will appear during services Monday night titled "His 
Dream Is Our Dream," sponsored by the Valley Interfaith Council, a coalition of 
about 200 churches. 
</P>
<P>
The service will start with a procession of about 40 elected officials and 
clergy from various religious faiths. Rabbi Aaron Weis, who walked with King in 
Alabama, will be among the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is get a Hispanic, Jewish, Korean, Protestant 
representation out here . . . to demonstrate that it's not just a holiday for 
blacks," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the interfaith council. The 
services will begin at 7:30 p.m. at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, 
18115 Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a drill team, choirs and dancers from at least 10 area schools 
will perform during a five-hour tribute beginning at 10 a.m. in the Pacoima 
Community Center at Glen Oaks and Van Nuys boulevards. Essays and art with the 
theme "His Dream Is Our Dream" will be shown at the Youth Culture Center, next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watch the young people perform, it's like a class," said Arthur 
Broadous, youth center director, who has seen the King tribute at least seven 
years. "A lot of kids never sat in the back of the bus, knew what it was like 
not to be able to eat in a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a student discussion of the "unfinished business" in King's legacy 
will end three hours of programming on the activist aired on KLCS-TV, Channel 
58, the educational station of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
programs begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In events today Harding Street School in Sylmar will hold its 21st annual 
commemoration of King, featuring a six-foot mural of the activist and 150 
students singing his favorite hymns. 
</P>
<P>
"The music is fantastic," said Susan Alves, a teacher and co-director of the 
program. "We had a dress rehearsal and two teachers were crying. . . ." 
Programs begin at 9 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. The school is at 13060 Harding St. 
</P>
<P>
Other events today include reenactments of Rosa Parks' bus trip in Alabama, 
where she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, triggering civil 
rights demonstrations. Re-enactments will be performed at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 
p.m. at Fenton Avenue School, 11828 Gain St. in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
All events are free and open to the public.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUNK DRIVER JAILED IN FATAL HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood woman was sentenced Thursday to a year in jail and three 
years probation for drunk driving that killed a 49-year-old Sherman Oaks woman 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael B. Farrell listened to impassioned 
testimony from the family of the accident victim, Mary Kay Chaleff, before 
sentencing Cheryl Lynn Ewell, 26, on one count each of hit-and-run and drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Chaleff's three sons, Michael, Andrew, and Daniel, said they forgive Ewell for 
the April 8 accident but asked the judge to send a message to the community by 
giving Ewell a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ewell's attorney, Andrew R. Willing, asked that Ewell be sentenced to a work 
furlough program or put under house arrest because she has no prior criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver pointed out that Ewell not only caused a death, 
but also fled the scene of the accident. Los Angeles police, who arrested 
Ewell, said she leaped from her car and hid in bushes until a witness persuaded 
her to return to the intersection where the accident had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
She faced a maximum term of four years in jail, Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
Ewell had a blood-alcohol level of 0.1%, the legal standard then for 
intoxication, when she struck Chaleff's car at Addison Street and Woodman 
Avenue.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN SENTENCED IN ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A39-year-old woman who lost custody of her children after suffering a nervous 
breakdown was sentenced Thursday to 2 1/2 years in prison for attempting to 
kidnap a 9-month-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Medrano pleaded guilty in San Fernando Superior Court Thursday to one 
count of attempted kidnaping for grabbing Eric Lukes from the arms of his 
mother, Diane Lukes, on Victory Boulevard in Sherman Oaks on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn said Medrano approached Diane Lukes, said 
"you cannot take care of that baby," struck Lukes in the face, grabbed the 
child and fled. 
</P>
<P>
She was stopped by two passers-by, who returned the child to Lukes and left 
without identifying themselves. Police found Medrano sitting on a curb nearby, 
Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The women did not know each other. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn said Medrano is mentally unstable and has been homeless for the last 1 1/2 
years. Her two children, whose ages were not available, live with Medrano's 
mother in Van Nuys.

3 DIE, 3 HURT WHEN PICKUP STRIKES SIDE OF CLIFF ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pickup struck the side of a cliff on the Antelope Valley Freeway near Agua 
Dulce on Thursday, killing three passengers and injuring three others, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The dead, who were riding in the bed of the pickup, were thrown onto the 
roadway, Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger thrown from the truck bed suffered major injuries and was 
taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver appeared to have been under the influence of alcohol, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the truck appeared to have rolled several times, littering the 
pavement with debris. 
</P>
<P>
No other vehicles were involved, and there were no witnesses, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and a passenger in the truck cab were being treated at Palmdale 
Hospital Medical Center for moderate injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the dead and injured were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 8:30 p.m. just south of the Escondido Canyon Road 
on-ramp, on the southbound side of the freeway, authorities said.

IT'S CHRISTMAS IN JANUARY FOR SOME ILLEGAL PARKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica and Beverly Hills municipal courts are giving delinquent 
parking violators a belated Christmas gift: no late penalty if the tickets are 
paid before Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
City officials from Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood -- which 
uses the Beverly Hills court -- persuaded the presiding judges of the two 
courts to approve the amnesty program. Officials hope the program will clear 
out a backlog of more than 400,000 outstanding parking tickets issued in the 
three cities, each aggressive in parking enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Clearing the paper work could also provide a financial windfall for the cities. 
If all the outstanding tickets were paid, Santa Monica would collect $4 
million, Beverly Hills $1.85 million, and West Hollywood $2 million. Each city 
keeps 85% to 90% of the amount collected, with the county keeping the balance. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects all the late tickets to be paid, city officials said. But if 
only 5% of the fines are collected in Santa Monica, for example, it would bring 
in $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica officials are trying to make up for about $110,000 that was 
refunded to about 3,000 motorists last year after officials discovered a mix-up 
over vehicle descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The three cities involved in the amnesty program are setting up a joint 
database to provide better access to information about repeat offenders in 
their jurisdictions. New computerized equipment allows parking enforcement 
officers to identify such vehicles in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Under local laws, vehicles with five or more outstanding citations can be towed 
or immobilized with a device similar to the Denver Boot, which is locked onto a 
tire to prevent the vehicle from moving. In addition, the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles can delay registration renewals for vehicles with that many 
unpaid tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The cities are sending letters to motorists with five or more outstanding 
tickets notifying them of the amnesty program. The waiver does not apply to 
delinquent tickets already paid or to any vehicle already towed or immobilized.

LATERALLY SPEAKING, IT WAS CLAY'S PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
AFC CHAMPIONSHIP: BROWNS' LINEBACKER ALMOST COST HIS TEAM A PLAYOFF BERTH, BUT 
THEN HE MADE THE GAME-SAVING INTERCEPTION AGAINST THE BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long-suffering Cleveland Brown fans, who still talk about the Drive and the 
Fumble, infamous plays that knocked their beloved Dawgs out of the Super Bowl, 
have a new topic of conversation this season: the Lateral. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Clay Matthews of the Browns scooped up a fumble and headed for the 
goal line in the fourth quarter of their last regular-season game at Houston. A 
posse of Oilers in pursuit, Matthews tried to lateral -- to, of all people, 
Chris Pike, a lumbering defensive tackle at 6-feet-8 and 290 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The ball never got to Pike. 
</P>
<P>
It sailed over his head. The Oilers recovered and scored on the next play to 
take a 20-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, the Browns came back to win, 24-20, as tailback Kevin Mack 
scored with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
That was a saving touchdown for Matthews. If the Browns had lost, they would 
have been eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd lost, I would have put Clay on the propeller for the plane ride back 
to Cleveland," Brown Coach Bud Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Matthews' father, Clay Sr.: "I almost died when I saw the lateral, I 
really did. I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, there goes his whole career on one lousy 
play.' 
</P>
<P>
"When they scored and won, I knew he was the most relieved guy in the whole 
stadium." 
</P>
<P>
After the victory over the Oilers, which gave the Browns the AFC Central 
championship, Matthews wore a big smile as he left the Astrodome field. 
</P>
<P>
But he has refused to acknowledge that he almost threw away the 1989 playoffs. 
And he hasn't grasped the idea that he would have been forever remembered in 
Cleveland for the Lateral, despite 12 exceptional seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I would have gone around the rest of my life feeling that I had 
ruined my career if we'd lost," Matthews said. "But if someone (on the Browns) 
would have caught it and gone in for a touchdown, I can't say that I would have 
gone around thinking that I was the greatest thing since sliced bread." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews considers the lateral to have been a smart play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unusual play, but for those who have followed my career closely I 
had lateraled five times before that, including twice in one game, and one went 
for a touchdown of 60 yards," Matthews said. "I had one where I intercepted a 
pass and ran for 36 yards and lateraled to Big Daddy Carl Hairston, who ran for 
another 40 and a touchdown against Cincinnati in 1987. That was the most 
talked-about play of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when you're five for five on laterals, it made perfect sense to me to go 
six for six. Obviously, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to. But not 
everything does." 
</P>
<P>
When the Browns returned to practice after the Houston game, Matthews arrived 
wearing a T-shirt with the inscription: "No Brains, No Headache." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a headache and some people are making the case that I don't have 
any brains," Matthews told Cleveland reporters. "I guess the smart thing to do 
would have been to fall down." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews did that smart thing after intercepting a pass with three seconds 
remaining to preserve the Browns' 34-30 win over the Buffalo Bills last 
weekend. That victory propelled the Browns into the AFC championship game for 
the third time in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Had Carson considered that Matthews might lateral after the interception? 
</P>
<P>
"Clay wasn't going to lateral that one," Carson said. "I had a gun on him and 
he wasn't going to get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
And why didn't Matthews try another lateral? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I didn't know where the Buffalo guys were," he said. "If I had caught 
it in an open space, I might have faked a couple of laterals and then fallen 
down just to give everybody a little jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Until that interception, running back Thurman Thomas had been beating Matthews 
all afternoon, having caught catching 13 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. 
But on the big play, Matthews stepped in front of Thomas and intercepted 
quarterback Jim Kelly's pass for his first postseason interception. 
</P>
<P>
Big plays are nothing new to Matthews, who has made a lot of them since joining 
the Browns. The first linebacker selected in the 1978 NFL draft, Matthews has 
become probably the best linebacker in Browns' history. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American inside linebacker at USC, Matthews was moved to outside 
linebacker in Cleveland. And there he has flourished, averaging 86 tackles a 
season. He also has rung up 51 sacks, third best in club history. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matthews had to adjust to a new defensive system under Carson, who 
switched the Browns from a 3-4 alignment to a 4-3, he had an extraordinary 
season and made the Pro Bowl for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' freedom as a pass rusher was restricted in Carson's structured 
defensive system. He was moved from the right side, where he was free to rush 
the passer, having only a blocking back to deal with, to the left side of the 
defense, where he lines up over the tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who said he thinks sacks are the ultimate for a linebacker, had just 
three of them this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been fortunate to play as long as I have, one of the last areas 
where you can still brainstorm and show some creativity is the pass rush," 
Matthews said. "When you're covering someone (in zone pass coverage) you're 
limited in what you can do. When you play the run it's almost like you see the 
stimulus and react. 
</P>
<P>
"But in pass rush, there are a thousand different ways you can to try to get to 
the quarterback. It's probably the last area of creativity left on the football 
field defensively. "I was disappointed that I wasn't involved in the rush as 
much as I had been in the past, but we don't always get what we want. We've 
been successful this year so onward and upward." 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Newsome, the Browns' tight end, and Matthews are the senior players with 
the Browns. Although Newsome, 33, has said that this is his final season, 
Matthews still approaches football with youthful zeal. Matthews, 33, has more 
kid in him than most rookies fresh out of college and he admits it. 
</P>
<P>
In the final year of his contract, he cringed at the mention of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep playing as long as it's still fun," Matthews said. "One of these 
days when I grow up, I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do for a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND 
</P>
<P>
Although he has spent his entire pro career in Cleveland, Matthews seems as 
misplaced in Cleveland as Howard the Duck, who, in a movie, landed there from 
outer space. Not many Clevelanders, for instance, have taken acting lessons and 
appeared on a platform with President Bush. Matthews received a lot of negative 
mail after he and several teammates had endorsed Bush during the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a California flake," said Tony Grossi, a sportswriter who covers the 
Browns for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "He's so atypical from Clevelanders that 
it's amazing that he's played here for 12 years. He has no conception of what 
'Cleveland blue collar' is all about." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the season ends, Matthews escapes to his home in Agoura Hills, where 
his idea of a good time is playing basketball on the regulation court in his 
backyard. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't return to Cleveland until training camp opens, and even though he 
doesn't participate in the Browns' off-season conditioning program, he always 
arrives at camp in top shape. He has lowered his time in the 40-yard dash for 
the last three seasons while adding 20 pounds of muscle. 
</P>
<P>
But Matthews is hardly a slick Hollywood creation who dresses in three-piece 
suits and drives an expensive foreign car. 
</P>
<P>
He owns the same 1973 Mercury Capri that he has driven back and forth from 
California to Cleveland ever since he was drafted. The odometer stopped at 
89,000 miles five years ago. And although he has grown wealthy in the Southern 
California real estate market, he doesn't flaunt his wealth, dressing in 
T-shirts and jeans. Long-time friends say they have never seen him in a suit 
and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' life revolves around his family, which includes five children, 
Jennifer, 8; Kyle, 7; Brian, 4; Clay, 3, and Casey, 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
William Clay Matthews Jr. might have been born to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
His father, also Clay, played offensive tackle, tight end and linebacker for 
the San Francisco 49ers in 1950 and from 1953-55. His younger brother, Bruce, 
is an offensive tackle for the Houston Oilers. Clay and Bruce will play 
together in the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Matthews didn't push his sons into football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't try to take out any of my frustrations or lack of success on them," 
he said. "I made a deal with them. I told them, 'If you ask me something, I'll 
be glad to help you, but if you don't ask, I'll assume you know what you're 
doing.' 
</P>
<P>
"They both asked for help in the same way, and it really surprised me. It had 
nothing to do with technique. Both of them were high school All-Americans and 
pretty highly publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"And strangely enough, both of them came to me and said, 'I'd like to go to 
USC, do you think I can play there?' And I told them, 'If you're going to be 
the best, you might as well play with the best; and if you think that USC is 
the best that there is, why don't you go find out?' " 
</P>
<P>
Clay and Bruce became All-Americans at USC. After graduating from USC in 1983, 
Bruce was selected in the first round by the Oilers. The Matthews brothers have 
played against one another twice a year since. 
</P>
<P>
Whom does their father root for when the Oilers play the Browns? 
</P>
<P>
"I answer that question every year," Matthews said. "When a reporter from 
Houston called me this year I said, 'Aren't you tired of writing the same story 
seven years in a row?' And he said, 'No, people forget about it from one year 
to the next.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm going to give you the same answer I gave him. I really don't know who 
I'm pulling for when they play. I can rationalize it in my mind and say that 
I'm pulling for Clay because he's in his 12th year and Bruce is only in his 
seventh year and I want Clay to go to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"But what really happens is that as the game goes on, I pull for whoever gets 
behind. I once did an interview in the Astrodome and I said that I was the only 
person in the Dome who can't lose." Although the senior Matthews is proud of 
sons Clay and Bruce, he's even prouder of his two other sons, twins Bradley and 
Raymond, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Although retarded, Bradley and Raymond held jobs and maintained their own 
apartments. Both excelled in the Special Olympics. Bradley was the state 
swimming champion at 25 meters, and Raymond was the state champion at 50 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hadn't been retarded, we'd have four Matthews in the NFL," Clay said 
of his brothers.

WILLIAMS GIVES MARYLAND FANS SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

COLLEGE PARK, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Cole Field House floor late Wednesday night, the Maryland basketball 
players were locked in an embrace, a regular, rugby-scrum circle of love. 
Meantime, in the sold-out, knocked-out, rocked-out stands, they were singing, 
"Aaaa-men, A-men, A-men." Party time, and don't wait up. 
</P>
<P>
When Gary Williams, the new coach, walked by the student section after the 
game, he was trailed by shouts of "Ga-ry, Ga-ry, Ga-ry." No one had ever 
chanted "Bob." (Of course, Bo-ob is a tough chant. Try it.) 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Bob Wade era at Maryland is officially over. You could tell it 
on the floor, where the Maryland team was playing defense with unaccustomed 
ferocity and offense with recognizable design. You could tell it in the stands, 
where there was the old-time frenzy. Given essentially the same cast Wade put 
on the floor a year ago, Gary Williams has won more games, more league games, 
more mind games, more of every kind of game, and in only half a season. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may be too early to suggest that the long siege at Maryland is 
finally at end, it is not too early to predict as much. We know this: In one 
game, Williams accomplished what Wade never did: He beat North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Beating Carolina is cause for celebration, not just in College Park, but 
wherever it may come. This is not like knocking over some Central American 
country, after all. Beating Carolina is overcoming history. Beating Carolina is 
more than you can hope for, all you can pray for. When any team beats North 
Carolina, the party follows and doesn't end until at least the next game. 
</P>
<P>
And so, let the good times roll. There's no point, if you're from Maryland, in 
taking a harder look. But at Carolina, they have to. There's something strange 
going on, other than just a loss to the Terps. What's really strange is this 
North Carolina team. 
</P>
<P>
It's so, well, so very average. 
</P>
<P>
It is so unranked (no Carolina team since 1970 has ended a season that way). It 
doesn't make half its shots. It is slow. 
</P>
<P>
The players, high-school All-Americans all, of course, are lost in the famed 
Smith system. Once, there were stars who had to sublimate their talents to fit 
in (Dean Smith is the punch line to the old joke: Who's the only person who 
could hold Walter Davis to 15 points?). Now, there are no such stars. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the traps? The backdoor cuts? The precise passing? The killer 
defense? 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Tar Heels don't have the people. Early in the first half against 
Maryland, King Rice, who plays point guard, the position Dean Smith made 
famous, dribbled a ball off his foot. It was the start of a series of misplays 
nearly too painful to watch. And the way to beat Maryland Wednesday was to 
pressure Walt Williams, a delightful, 6-foot-8 point guard, who can make a game 
exciting for either side. But Carolina couldn't do anything with him but watch 
him score 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
That North Carolina came back in the end can be attributed, in equal parts, to 
history-steeped Carolina belief and to Maryland's game-ending prevent defense. 
The effort made Smith happy. Nothing else did. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a learning experience," he would say after the game. "But we have to 
start doing it, not just learning." 
</P>
<P>
Losing is learning at North Carolina, which is about to pass Kentucky to become 
the winningest team of all time. The Tar Heels finished the last decade with 
nine consecutive top 10 finishes, capped by at least a Final 16 showing in the 
NCAA Tournament. And now this North Carolina team, picked first preseason, as 
usual, is 10-6 and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The players are confused. No, they're dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
What in the name of Michael Jordan is going on? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem is we're trying to get better all at once," said Rick Fox, 
who is Carolina's best player. "We need to concentrate better on what we're 
doing each game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a certain amount of pressure to live up to the North Carolina 
tradition. Right now, we're trying to build Rome in an hour." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Smith has been a selective recruiter, going after only those players 
who have a chance both to graduate and, for 30-odd nights a year, to be 
otherworldly. In the past few years, he has missed on some of the players he 
wanted. And one he got, J.R. Reid, he was happy to leave a year early for the 
pros after last season. And so, he is left with a team that doesn't have a 
great shooter, that can't play the trap, that is missing the usual 
ball-handling, that makes mistakes. It is what happens to every program, except 
that it has never happened to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hard," said senior center Scott Williams. "But the season isn't over. 
There is a lot still to salvage." 
</P>
<P>
The usual salvage job at North Carolina is making up for losing the ACC 
tournament by trying to make the Final Four. This year, for the first time in 
what seems like forever, Carolina is not a sure thing to even make the NCAA 
Tournament. Try believing that. You know they can't in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Smith must have trouble with the concept. He is a good and honest man who 
stands for everything that is right in college sports. And, from all reports, 
he is having, even by Carolina standards, a terrific recruiting year. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, it's Maryland doing the celebrating. And Smith who's having to 
say, as he did the other night, "No one's responsible for the way we're playing 
-- except me."

DEFENSIVE BACKS: 49ERS' LOTT CONCENTRATES ON STOPPING THE PASS FIRST. RAMS' 
GRAY HAS TO DO A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the NFL champion San Francisco 49ers, it was touch and go in the Super Bowl 
at Miami last year when the Cincinnati Bengals sent rookie running back Ickey 
Woods prancing out around the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Woods had been having a big game. Indeed, he'd had a big season, making rookie 
of the year. But this time, he didn't even cross the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
As he turned to cut upfield, he was surprised to see 49er free safety Ronnie 
Lott, who, as he plowed into Woods' chest, was moving very fast. 
</P>
<P>
It was as if a bomb had gone off in the big running back's chest. He stopped, 
shuddered perceptibly and dropped to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Woods played again that day, though not very well. And, injured this season, he 
hasn't done much since. 
</P>
<P>
Lott, however, is still in business, still knocking down passes and people -- 
seemingly indiscriminately -- on his way to his eighth Pro Bowl in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"As a defensive back, my job is pass defense," he said. "Tackling running backs 
is kind of an afterthought, kind of a bonus. Against the Rams (Sunday) my 
focus, as usual, will be on the pass, not the run. It doesn't matter whether 
we're man for man or in a zone defense. I'll be thinking pass at the start of 
every play." 
</P>
<P>
So how does a free safety think pass and see run? And get up fast enough to 
tackle Woods for a loss? 
</P>
<P>
"That time I was reading the back-side tight end," Lott said, identifying a 
back-side player as one who lines up away from the side where the ball is 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all keys and reads and responses," he said. "Say Damone Johnson is at 
tight end for the Rams. He might release outside or inside, or fire straight 
out. Those are keys. My job is to read the key correctly and respond 
instantly." 
</P>
<P>
Again this year, the Rams have a 1,000-yard rusher, Greg Bell. Plus guile and 
speed at wide receiver in Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson. In the NFC 
championship game, how will Lott cope with all that? 
</P>
<P>
"When Jim Everett is at quarterback, in a game of this magnitude, you look for 
a pass on every down," he said. "They won't throw on every play, but you look 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
On third-and-one? 
</P>
<P>
"Third-and-one will really be second-and-one," Lott said. "In this game, the 
Rams will be going for it (on fourth down)." 
</P>
<P>
What if Lott is chasing Ellard as Bell blasts through with the ball? 
</P>
<P>
"You hope that somebody in the front seven will get him," Lott said. "My job, 
if Greg Bell or Robert Delpino has the ball, is to react -- to make sure I get 
in front of them. Greg is a powerful runner -- he can run over you -- but I 
don't mind being run over if I can hold on. We'll let him have his nine or 10 
(yards)." 
</P>
<P>
So, it's Flipper Anderson first? 
</P>
<P>
Said Lott: "I'm thinking Flipper first, second, third and fourth." 
</P>
<P>
GRAY HAS IT TOUGHER 
</P>
<P>
At Anaheim this week, the defensive emphasis in Ram practices has been slightly 
different. Whereas the 49er secondary concentrates on pass plays, Ram coaches 
involve their secondary in runs and passes both. 
</P>
<P>
The only 49er defensive back who has much running-play responsibility is the 
strong safety, Chet Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Rams, in their famous zone defenses, frequently use 
cornerbacks on force plays against runs. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ram cornerback Jerry Gray, who will join Lott in the NFC Pro Bowl 
lineup next month for the fourth consecutive year, agrees that it's tougher 
playing his position on his team than it would be on most other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just the 49ers," said Gray, who led the Rams in tackles this season 
with 67. "Most clubs tell their cornerbacks not to worry about the run, just 
watch the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem for me -- at the start of every play -- is getting mentally ready 
for two totally different things. A Ram cornerback has to be an excellent 
tackler and an excellent cover guy -- but you never know what you'll be doing 
next." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's job really gets complicated in a 49er game, in which quarterback Joe 
Montana is always a threat to throw to a wide receiver, Jerry Rice or John 
Taylor, or a tight end -- or back. And, in which halfback Roger Craig is always 
a threat to run away. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal Sunday is to be set every time to stop either the deep ball or the 
running game," Gray said. "I can do either. I learned the keys and the 
techniques years ago. So it's all mental -- trying to be ready for anything, 
for everything. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't let the 49ers get their running game going. They can put 
together a 60-yard drive in a minute and a half. No team in the league does a 
better job of mixing it up -- dumping the ball off, getting it deep, running 
the ball. First, you think through what you might have to do, then you do it." 
</P>
<P>
In playing mental football, when you're up against the 49ers, what's the most 
important requirement? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't let yourself get discouraged if they get a play on you," Gray said. 
"You have to keep your confidence and enthusiasm up when they hit you with a 
big play -- as they will. 
</P>
<P>
"John Taylor runs passes with a punt returner's skills. Jerry Rice is the top 
offensive player in the league. Roger Craig is the most determined runner in 
the league. You know all about Joe Montana. You don't shut those guys out." 
</P>
<P>
In a 49er game, after Montana makes a big play, what does it take to keep 
confidence up? 
</P>
<P>
"You need the shortest memory in the stadium," Gray said. "You have to 
completely forget what they just did. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go back out there, you have to forget the past and get ready for 
anything: a dink, a bomb or Roger Craig. It's all mental." 
</P>
<P>
A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
<P>
In the third Ram-49er game of the season, Gray and Lott agree, the winning 
players will be those who most effectively defend against Montana and Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is to visualize the play the way you want to make it, and then make 
it," Gray said. "I think of myself closing on Jerry Rice before the ball closes 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I visualize getting Roger Craig down any way I can. He's such a powerful, 
high-knee action runner that you have to grab whatever you can grab. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to be completely ready for Rice and Craig at the same time. The 
things you've got to do to stop Rice are crazily different from what it takes 
to stop Craig. And you never know what Montana is going to do with that ball 
until he does it. But it helps a lot to visualize yourself making both kinds of 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Ram who concerns the 49ers most, Lott said, isn't Ellard or Bell but 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody raves about Everett's strong arm," Lott said. "It isn't that at all. 
It's his strong mind. He has the nerve to wait and fall back and throw the ball 
at just the right split second. I think Jim Everett should be the first 
$3-million man in football." 
</P>
<P>
If Lott and Gray sometimes talk like coaches, one reason is that both have 
studied the game for years. Both, unlike many athletes, are college graduates 
who have worked and willed their way into many Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The summer after his rookie year with the Rams, Gray hustled back to Texas to 
earn his degree in communications. 
</P>
<P>
One of eight children of a Lubbock dock loader, Gray, who stands just under 6 
feet and weighs 183 pounds, still spends the spring months in the peace and 
quiet of Austin, getting ready for Rice and Craig. 
</P>
<P>
Lott, a 203-pounder at 6-1, grew up in Rialto but has moved to the San 
Francisco area. Between morning and afternoon 49er practices, he goes home for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
One of three children of a regular army master sergeant, Lott, a public 
administration major, graduated with his USC class in four years, going to 
school year-round for two of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be worth giving up a few summer evenings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a free safety, Lott sees the world from a perspective that is somewhat 
different from that of Gray, a cornerback who plays free safety only in the 
Rams' nickel defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to keep a notebook with entries on every NFL receiver and running back, 
but I don't do that anymore," Lott said. "I'm convinced now that pro defense 
isn't a question of whether they're going to run at you, or throw the ball, on 
any given play. 
</P>
<P>
"Football today is a coordinators' game. I try to understand the whole 
situation. I try to understand what the offensive coordinators are up to. If I 
can get a little handle on that, I don't worry so much about whether they're 
going to throw it to Ellard this time, or hand it to Bell. It's more helpful to 
understand the overall philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
What Lott means is that at times he can guess what's coming -- in somewhat the 
same sense that, occasionally, some hitters can correctly guess the location of 
a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
With a big game coming up, however, he wouldn't say that. 
</P>
<P>
What he said was: "There are weak areas in every defense, and a good 
coordinator is a guy who properly attacks the weak points. That's what makes 
(Ram coordinator) Ernie Zampese a genius. 
</P>
<P>
"NFL coordinators are all different, and so the offenses are all different, 
with players that are much the same. That makes defensive football about 80% 
mental. 
</P>
<P>
"But the game is won or lost with the other 20% of what you've got. You still 
have to make the play. I've known some great readers who weren't very good 
players. The real key is the quickness, the athletic ability, to jump right now 
when your head says jump." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve months ago, Lott combined the 80% and the 20% to put Ickey Woods away, 
but in all these years, truthfully, he's never been able to hit Greg Bell that 
hard.

KAY HURT, DOUBTFUL FOR DENVER

<TEXT>
<P>
Starting tight end Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos suffered a pulled thigh 
muscle in practice, putting his status for Sunday's AFC championship game in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Kay injured the muscle in his left thigh while running wind sprints at the end 
of Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, you'd have to list him as doubtful," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. 
"If it's sore today, I'd say it would be even more sore tomorrow. And he 
doesn't have much time to recover. A thigh muscle is awful hard to come back 
from." 
</P>
<P>
If Kay can't play on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, it would be a blow to 
Denver's running game. Kay is considered one of the best run-blocking tight 
ends in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said Pat Kelly probably will make his first pro start if Kay can't play, 
with Orson Mobley in reserve. The Broncos might also activate former USC tight 
end Paul Green. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Newsome of the Browns has reached all but one of his goals in pro 
football. And time is running out in his quest to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accomplished everything a tight end can accomplish except getting the 
opportunity to play in the Super Bowl," Newsome said. "That's the one thing 
that has eluded me. I guess that's why this has such a big meaning to me." 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Newsome is the NFL's all-time leading tight end with 639 
receptions -- fifth among all receivers. His streak of 150 consecutive games 
with at least one catch ended Oct. 29 against Houston, but he has remained an 
important part of the offense. In last week's 34-30 victory over Buffalo, he 
had four catches for 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several weeks, his resolve to retire at the end of the season 
seems to have weakened, and Newsome now says he won't make a final decision on 
his career until the Browns finish the year. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates, however, are treating the playoffs as though they are Newsome's 
last gasp. Cleveland's kicking team chanted his name before the opening kickoff 
against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
So they're 0-3 in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So another loss in the big game will tie them with Minnesota for the worst 
Super Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
But the Denver Broncos are still willing to risk everything for another chance 
at the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, they are fully aware of the talk of the town: if the Broncos are 
going to be humiliated again in the Super Bowl, they're better off losing 
Sunday's AFC championship game against Cleveland before they even get to New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard that they're saying, 'Hopefully we won't go back because we don't 
want to go and lose again,' " quarterback John Elway said. "Those people who 
ask, 'Why go back?' ought to go hide in their closets. That's the easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a chance, at least a chance to step up to bat. We'll give it all we've 
got. If we lose, we lose. If we win, we're world champs. I'd hate to be stuck 
in my closet. No one wants to go 0-4 like the Minnesota Vikings, but I'm not 
worried about that."

AGENT CALLS NEGOTIATIONS CORDIAL, BUT JOYNER FILES FOR ARBITRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
First baseman Wally Joyner, whose contract negotiations with the Angels have 
been marked by occasional bitterness, filed for salary arbitration Thursday, 
but his attorney had only nice things to say about the club. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Axelrod left the impression that the matter of Joyner's contract could be 
resolved short of an arbitration hearing in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been extremely cordial, and I'd say that given the history of 
our relationship (with the Angels), there's more than a possibility that we'll 
talk again," Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner filed for arbitration last year before agreeing to a 1989 contract for 
$920,000. He made another $50,000 in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Players who file for arbitration will exchange figures with their clubs 
Tuesday. An arbitrator will then choose the figures of one or the other after a 
hearing in February. The player and his club can continue negotiating until the 
hearing begins. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod, who represents Joyner in association with Michael Watkins, said that 
for the first time in their relationship the Angels came in with a competitive 
offer, but that "enough of a difference" remains for Joyner to protect his 
options by filing. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said the wave of remarkable signings this winter has complicated 
negotiations by making it difficult to draw comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably a $500,000 range in which we could put Wally and be valid 
seeking either the top end or the bottom," he said. "We could make a good 
argument for our figure, and the Angels could make a good argument for theirs. 
I think both sides made an effort to come in at market value." 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said he broached a multiyear contract in his talks with the club, but 
was told that with so much going on in the market, so many players yet to sign 
(the Angels have 10 others eligible for arbitration) and so much doubt about 
the course of the collective bargaining talks, the Angels would rather consider 
only a one-year contract at this time. ROSS NEWHAN

RAMS, 49ERS SHOW RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just exactly what is it that familiarity breeds? 
</P>
<P>
If you believe what the Rams and 49ers are saying these days, it's respect. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson says the 49ers are "the best team of the decade and 
this may be the best of all those good 49er teams." Joe Montana says the 49ers 
"always felt that somewhere down the line" they would play the Rams a third 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
They have butted heads enough to know physical strengths and weaknesses. But 
what about strategy? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be some trickery," Ram quarterback Jim Everett said. "Both 
sides will for the jugular." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson describes it as more of a chess game. 
</P>
<P>
"You tend to get a sense of how the other team reacts to you," he said. "In the 
first two games, you plot out certain ideas and you know the next time they'll 
take them away. So you do something slightly different . . . (but) it would be 
foolish for either of us try and alter our style of offense." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the defenses try to come up with ways to confuse the quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder for you to surprise them," said Fritz Shurmur, Ram defensive 
coordinator. "Even if you do something new, it will be out of your basic 
defense, and so those things are not so hard for them to adjust to. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd like to get yourself into a situation where Joe's rhythm is somewhat 
disturbed. If you can do that and limit the big plays, then you've got a chance 
to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams certainly don't want to become any more familiar with the "five-yard 
pass and mile-and-a-half run" as Robinson calls 49er receiver John Taylor's 
touchdowns of 92 and 95 yards in the Rams' 30-27 loss Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
They're even practicing adjusting their angle of attack against the short slant 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
"What these people (Taylor and Jerry Rice) do is that when they catch short 
passes, they become backs running through the secondary very quickly," Robinson 
said. "Most receivers running the slant pause and gather themselves to prepare 
to absorb the hit. For a fraction of a second, anyway, they're kind of 
stationary targets. 
</P>
<P>
"But both of these guys are instantaneously moving through the secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Montana scoffs at the notion that the 49ers are out to prove they can win a 
Super Bowl without the guidance of Bill Walsh. But the 49er quarterback does 
think the coaching change has had positive residual effects on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made everyone spend a lot more time in the (play) book," Montana said. 
"There's been a lot more mental preparation. There have been just enough subtle 
changes to make everyone have to buckle down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Everett thinks the Rams are a better team because of their loss to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that game burned our nerves a little bit," he said. "It made us 
tougher, gave us a stronger will to win." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said safety Vince Newsome probably will not test his sprained ankle 
until Sunday before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks good standing and watching practice, but there's a question of 
whether or not he can run," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game will be a case of friendly rivalry for 49er wide receiver Mike 
Sherrard and Ram receiver Flipper Anderson, who went to UCLA together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough. I enjoy watching him and I want him to do well when 
he's not playing us," Sherrard said. "He's a good receiver. He didn't start 
last year because of politics. He was a second-round pick and Aaron Cox was a 
first-round and you have to give him the nod, regardless. He's really done 
well. He's playing hard and you can really tell he's focused in." 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard, a walk-on at UCLA who set school records with 124 receptions and 
1,937 receiving yards, caught 41 passes for 744 yards as a rookie with the 
Cowboys in 1986 but has missed the past three seasons because of recurring leg 
fractures. The 26-year-old wide receiver, who was activated from the physically 
unable to perform list Jan. 5, played against Minnesota last week but did not 
make any receptions.

MANNING: A STARTING RESERVE; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: HE'S STILL CLASSIFIED AS A SUBSTITUTE, BUT INJURY TO NORMAN HAS 
BROUGHT MORE PLAYING TIME, BETTER PRODUCTION.

<P>
He made the layup. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning. Here at the Bradley Center, last Jan. 4. Late in the first 
quarter, he made the layup that cut the Milwaukee Bucks' lead to 25-17 against 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Then he limped upcourt and, a few seconds later, to the bench. Finally, the 
locker room. The Bucks' physician announced at game's end that Manning had 
hyper-extended his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers lost the game, lost Manning for the final three games of the trip 
as he returned to Los Angeles for further examinations and then lost him for 
the season after it was determined that the injury was actually a severely torn 
ligament. Manning underwent surgery, and the Clippers underwent a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
Manning returns to the Bradley Center tonight in the Clippers' next-to-last 
stop of an eight-game trip, insisting that stepping back onto the court where 
he was injured so badly will have no special significance. That's the past. 
</P>
<P>
The present? He will start in the Clipper front court, just as when last here, 
but only because Ken Norman is injured. Manning has been frustrated with his 
sometimes limited role in the offense, often feeling frozen out as Ron Harper 
and Benoit Benjamin are given more attention. He has struggled to reclaim his 
shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
"But everything with Danny is a plus," Coach Don Casey said. "People still have 
to remember he's really only a rookie in terms of games played with no training 
camp and playing under a guideline of minutes. I think he has done well. He's 
had some days when his timing has been off, but that could be expected. And he 
has worked hard to correct it." 
</P>
<P>
The physical aspect of the comeback has been a textbook success -- no swelling, 
no pain, no apparent loss of speed or mobility, even with a brace. But the 
things that used to come naturally have taken the most time to return. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who underwent a 2 1/2-hour operation at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center in Inglewood a year ago Sunday, started shooting baskets about two weeks 
after his his release from the hospital. Without doctors knowing, he went to a 
park near his Hermosa Beach home, put pressure on the good leg and fired away 
in solitude, limped after the ball and shot some more. 
</P>
<P>
He always got the ball then. Now, there are teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get into the game and we run a lot of isolation plays (clearing an area 
of defenders to give a player a clean shot), it gets frustrating for me," 
Manning said. "I don't think it's griping to say you want the ball. It's hard 
because I'm only in there 15 or 20 or 30 minutes, and so much of that is 
getting out of the way of other people." 
</P>
<P>
It has improved recently. Maybe because his time limit is at a comfortable 35 
minutes, maybe because more of the plays are coming his way. Whatever, it's 
getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said. "As long as we come out and move the ball around, it's cool." 
</P>
<P>
The concerns over his shooting have dissipated with recent showings, starting 
with a 12-for-17 effort last Friday at Boston. Manning was more concerned with 
his performance at the free-throw line than from the field, but he made a 
self-examination of both, recalling the simple mechanics that had helped make 
him the 1988 college player of the year, No. 1 draft pick and a 16.7-point 
scorer in 26 games of 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been obvious. In the last four games, all starts in place of 
Norman, he is averaging 22.8 points and shooting 59.1%. The recent run has 
boosted Manning's season numbers to 13.4 and 52.9%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was his shooting touch," Casey said. "It was timing -- him 
getting the ball at the right time, us getting him into the right flow with our 
offense. He's a movement player, a guy who plays with a lot of cutting and 
penetration." 
</P>
<P>
He's also, basically, a reserve. Manning has started in eight of his 21 
appearances this season, and seven were when Norman was injured. The other 
start, Dec. 13 against Detroit at the Sports Arena, was Norman's first game 
back from tendinitis in a knee and a sore wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Manning has no problem with coming off the bench at this stage and has told 
Casey as much. Getting minutes is the main thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with that," he said. "My thing is, 'Just tell me what you 
want from me.' I don't want to be uncertain about my role. Winning is the 
bottom line. That's all I want to do."

RALPHS ASSERTS INDEPENDENCE, SAYS IT'S FINANCIALLY FIT DESPITE PARENT'S WOES

<P>
Ralphs Grocery Co. Chairman Byron Allumbaugh spent much of Thursday trying to 
put distance between the supermarket chain and its financially troubled owner 
Campeau Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a totally separate corporation with our own bonds, with our own banks," 
said Allumbaugh on Thursday, a few hours before he made the same point before a 
room of 400 concerned suppliers. "We are about as bulletproof and stand alone 
as you can be." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Ralphs' bullish executive, industry analysts say the Southern 
California supermarket chain is financially fit and insulated from Campeau's 
woes. But some speculate that Ralphs might be sold off if Campeau deteriorates 
and that the grocery chain will face even stiffer local competition down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs, which became part of the Campeau retailing empire as part of the 
takeover of Federated Stores in 1988, estimates that it will cut net losses to 
$31.7 million in 1989 from $72.6 million in 1988. And the Compton-based chain 
said it expects sales to grow to $4.5 billion by 1994 from an estimated $2.6 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Ralphs generates enough cash to make payments on its nearly $1 
billion of debt and to remodel and open new stores in the never-ending race to 
capture a share of the $23 billion that Southern Californians spend annually on 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Ralphs has $40 million on hand to pay off $11.3 million in debt 
due at the end of this month, says Andrew Leinoff, a senior securities analyst 
at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei in Montpelier, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
"Ralphs has been doing everything that it needs to do to be successful," said 
Leinoff, who noted that the chain also plans to spend $100 million on 
remodeling and building new stores. "It's more than enough to fund their 
expansion and competitive position." 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs might have also gained some breathing room thanks to a recent round of 
supermarket industry restructuring that has left some of its competitors, such 
as Vons, with a lot of debt. Furthermore, the merger of Alpha Beta, which is 
owned by American Stores Corp, and Lucky Stores has been delayed after the 
state attorney general opposed the combination on anti-competitive grounds. The 
case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole industry is moving ahead more cautiously than they have been because 
of all the debt," said one supermarket industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralphs relationship with financially troubled Campeau has tainted its image 
and worried suppliers. Allumbaugh, who sits on the Campeau board, has 
continually denied rumors that Ralphs will file for bankruptcy and that Campeau 
will siphon off cash from the chain. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be dragged into it," said Allumbaugh of Campeau's financial 
predicament. "It's important that our suppliers and our customers understand 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs officials say the company is structured so the bankruptcy of sister 
companies Allied and Federated stores, both owned by Campeau, would not include 
the supermarket chain. Campeau itself has stated that Ralphs is not included in 
any potential bankruptcy filing plans, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
Allumbaugh also disputed speculation that Ralphs would be sold if Campeau filed 
for bankruptcy. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late 
Wednesday, Campeau's advisers said Ralphs could fetch up to $1.6 billion in a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no intention of selling Ralphs because we are such a major asset to 
them," Allumbaugh said. "Selling Ralphs would also trigger a huge tax liability 
to Campeau." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say whatever happens with Campeau the chain will have to tangle with 
bolder competitors who will have digested acquisitions and paid off debt within 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"In three years, they might have to spend more to remain competitive with Vons 
and American Stores," said Leinoff. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah A. Stack, retailing analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, said, 
"Vons has gained market share in the past two years because of its success in 
remodeling stores and opening new types of units," such as Pavilions and 
Tianguis. 
</P>
<P>
"But Ralphs and Lucky have not demonstrated that they can garner market share 
by diversification in format," Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials say Ralphs will remain a major industry player. 
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the most experienced food retailers in America," said Jack 
Brown, chairman of Stater Bros. supermarkets. "We have not seen any weakness."

FLORIDA'S CHRISTMAS FREEZE WAS A GIFT TO BRAZIL; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: THE LATEST DISASTER FOR THE U.S. CITRUS INDUSTRY HAS HELPED CEMENT 
THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S STATUS AS THE WORLD'S JUICE MAKER.

Nothing has had more impact on the orange juice industry in Brazil than the 
Florida thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
When it registered freezing temperatures in 1962, it made juice processors look 
south for oranges. They found Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
When it heralded another tree-killing freeze in 1977, it handed Brazil an 
estimated 50% of the U.S. juice market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
And when it brought four devastating freezes in the first five years of the 
1980s, it symbolized Brazil's permanent status as juice maker to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing temperatures over the Christmas weekend struck yet another blow to 
Florida's citrus industry, destroying nearly 29% of the orange crop and cutting 
juice production by about 50%, officials with the Florida Agricultural 
Statistics Service announced Thursday in their first post-freeze crop report. 
</P>
<P>
And Brazil has gained again. 
</P>
<P>
"This freeze comes at a time when Brazil has a record crop," said Ed Missiaen, 
an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agriculture 
Service. "And we're in the situation where we were in the early '80s. Brazil 
will have over half of our market again." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's juice exports are expected to increase as much as 36% worldwide, 
Brazilian diplomatic sources said Thursday, as the country moves into markets 
that belonged to Florida before temperatures plunged into the teens. 
</P>
<P>
Damaged oranges still litter groves in north-central Florida, where they lie on 
a carpet of leaves that also fell victim to subfreezing temperatures nearly 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the fallen leaves are a good sign, growers say, an indication that the 
trees survived the cold. The worst portent is a tree covered in burst bark and 
bristling with dead foliage. Such trees are a total loss, like an estimated 10% 
of Jim Simpson's 600 acres in Mt. Dora, northwest of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"The bark is mildewed underneath," says Simpson, owner of Simpson Fruit Co. 
"You can scrape through the bark. It's no longer green. It's slick, slimy, with 
a black mildew to it." 
</P>
<P>
During the Christmas freeze -- Florida's ninth in the past 100 years -- 
temperatures began to drop on Dec. 23. At 11 a.m., it was 32 degrees in Mt. 
Dora. Three hours later, Simpson's thermometer was registering 28 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. on Dec. 24, the temperature had plunged to 17 degrees. The low later 
that night was 22 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts say tree damage begins after only four hours of 28-degree 
temperatures. So Simpson spent the weekend monitoring the cold and trying to 
protect his livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent two days without sleeping more than 45 minutes," Simpson said. But he 
was luckier this time than in the 1985 freeze, when he was forced to bulldoze 
85% of his trees because of cold damage. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hensel, who raises citrus, cattle and poultry, said his trees should be 
fine, but his 50-acre orange crop is a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
"In Florida, the only way to go is diversify," Hensel said, as he surveyed his 
ruined crop this week. "If you don't, something like this will kill you, put 
you out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's citrus industry had troubles of its own in the 1950s, when nearly all 
of its orange trees were destroyed by a virus called Tristeza. 
</P>
<P>
When Florida fell victim to the 1962 freeze, replanting had just begun in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1962 freeze is really what sent the message to Brazil," said Pat Cockrell, 
director of commodity activities for the Florida Farm Bureau Federation. 
"That's what really got Brazil back onto the path to citrus." 
</P>
<P>
But the country's processors did not do it alone. Multinational corporations 
began to invest in joint ventures with the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
One notable example, Cockrell said, was an agreement between Sucocitrico 
Cutrale S.A. and Coca Cola's Minute Maid division, whereby Minute Maid would 
buy whatever Cutrale could process. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the 1977 freeze hit, Brazil was able to fill the void, shipping 
64,000 metric tons of frozen concentrated orange juice to the United States, an 
incredible jump from the 2,000 metric tons exported a decade before. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, the Brazilian industry really took off," said one Brazilian 
diplomatic source. "All of a sudden there was a huge potential market outside 
of Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
But until the 1980s, Brazil was still a secondary supplier, a kind of 
pantry-on-demand that U.S. processors could ignore in good times. 
</P>
<P>
"Into 1980, we saw Brazil have excess frozen concentrated orange juice," 
Cockrell said. "They were producing more than the market could absorb. But with 
our freezes, starting in 1981, the Brazilians moved from that secondary 
position to become a major supplier." 
</P>
<P>
And they plan to stay in that position. Between 1974 and 1989, the number of 
orange trees in Brazil more than doubled, from 68 million to 151 million. 
Projections for 1990 run as high as 18 million to 20 million new trees in the 
state of Sao Paolo. 
</P>
<P>
During that same time, Florida's total citrus acreage dropped from 860,000 to 
700,000. Although current tree damage has yet to be assessed, the Christmas 
freeze will probably cause that figure to shrink yet again, Florida agriculture 
experts predict. 
</P>
<P>
What they do know for certain, however, is that the state's orange crop will 
probably drop 29% -- from an estimated 130 million 90-pound boxes to about 92 
million, state officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the oranges that are salvaged will not yield as much juice as last 
year's crop, also because of freeze damage. Juice production will probably drop 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the freeze in Florida and Texas, California fresh orange 
prices increased briefly, said Mike Henry, spokesman for the California Farm 
Bureau Federation in Sacramento. Retail prices jumped 5 to 10 cents a pound, 
but have since returned to normal. Juice prices in California were not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
"The full extent of the freeze damage on industry and the local economy will 
take some time to assess," said Robert Behr, economic research director for the 
Florida Department of Citrus. "It will be months before we know the extent of 
tree damage and its impact on future production." 
</P>
<P>
For now, he said, Brazil will take over the market that Florida cannot supply. 
To Behr, that's not entirely bad. 
</P>
<P>
"That helps in the long term by keeping the market alive," Behr said. "We see 
that, in some sense, as a valued availability of juice." 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE FREEZE 
</P>
<P>
Overall production 
</P>
<P>
Citrus production, including oranges and grapefruit, expected to decline 25% 
from the 1988-89 season to 9.63 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
Orange production expected to drop 24% this season to fewer than 158 million 
boxes. 
</P>

CAMPEAU WILL SPLIT OFF ITS U.S. RETAIL OPERATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: ROBERT CAMPEAU WILL NO LONGER BE INVOLVED IN RUNNING THOSE UNITS. A 
SEPARATE BOARD WILL BE APPOINTED. 
</P>

<P>
Campeau Corp., after staggering for months under huge takeover debts, 
officially stripped the company's founder of most of his power and disclosed a 
major overhaul late Thursday to rescue its vast U.S. department store chains 
from near-collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The move was another in a series of shattering personal blows to Robert 
Campeau, 66, a one-time factory hand and home builder who dreamed of running a 
glamorous retailing empire. He will continue to develop and manage real estate 
holdings but will have no authority over the company's expansive U.S. 
operations, according to a statement from the company. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau Corp. was widely expected to seek bankruptcy court protection for its 
troubled department store divisions. But at least for now, officials said they 
would put the U.S. stores into a trust insulated from the Toronto-based parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The company's announcement was the biggest surprise in a series of developments 
to roil the the U.S. retail and apparel industries in recent months. Over much 
of the country, Campeau is a major power in retailing with such prominent 
chains as Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Strauss, Burdines, Jordan Marsh and the 
Bon Marche. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's 258 department stores account for an estimated 3% of the nation's 
general merchandise sales, and they comprise the second-largest U.S. department 
store organization in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, however, Campeau's only retail business is the 
143-store Ralphs supermarkets chain. That Compton-based business is independent 
of Federated and Allied and is considered in good financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau became a retailing force by buying Allied Stores for $3.4 billion in 
1986 and acquiring Federated Department Stores for $6.6 billion after a 
drawn-out takeover battle in 1988. Analysts have said most of the Federated and 
Allied chains are solid stores and would thrive if their takeover debts were 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
"You took good companies and you got into a Wall Street bidding war that 
burdened them with too much debt," explained Geoffrey D. Lurie, president of 
G.D.L. Management Inc., a corporate turnaround consultant in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for Campeau's U.S. operations have appeared bleak at least since 
September. At that time, crushing interest expenses from takeover debts forced 
Campeau to seek an 11th-hour bailout loan of $250 million from the secretive 
and hugely wealthy Reichmann brothers, owners of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; 
York Developments. As part of the deal, Robert Campeau was forced to relinquish 
some of his managerial authority, but his exact role had been somewhat unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the September deal, suppliers began curtailing shipments to Campeau 
department stores at the urging of credit managers who were concerned about the 
ability of the stores to pay bills. In recent weeks, the supply problem edged 
toward a crisis, threatening to leave the stores with half-empty shelves this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Many apparel manufacturing executives have urged Campeau to seek Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection, a maneuver that helps beleaguered businesses get fresh 
credit for new merchandise. Instead, however, Campeau apparently is trying to 
restore the confidence of lenders and suppliers with a thorough reorganization 
not requiring a bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the setup, Robert Campeau would be separated from his company's U.S. 
operations by several layers of authority. "He has no involvement whatsoever 
with the U.S. companies," Byron Allumbaugh, chairman of Ralphs and currently a 
member of the Campeau board, said in a telephone interview after returning to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
First, a group of independent trustees will be appointed to represent Campeau 
and other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
After that, a new board -- composed mostly of outside directors -- would be 
created to direct the Campeau U.S. operations. In addition, the company will 
add three key executives to manage the enterprise: a chief executive, a chief 
operating officer and a chairman of the department store operations. 
</P>
<P>
The top management of Campeau's U.S. organization also will include Allumbaugh, 
who will continue to head the Ralphs division, and Chance Bahadur, who was 
named Wednesday to assume the duties of chief financial officer for the U.S. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Allumbaugh said Campeau is close to naming the new directors and executives, a 
group that he promised would be headed by a "very prominent person." 
</P>
<P>
He gave few details about the four days of lengthy board meetings that led to 
Thursday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Allumbaugh said, however, that the fiery Robert Campeau gave up much of his 
authority willingly. "His feeling was that if he was a detriment to the 
company's U.S. interests, he would bow out." 
</P>
<P>
The Ralphs chairman said that there would be further announcements from Campeau 
in coming days but that they would mainly "fill in the gaps" left in Thursday's 
disclosures, including the names of new company officials. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have predicted that the Campeau organization would eventually emerge 
from a bankruptcy or another form of reorganization by selling Ralphs and some 
of its prestigious department store chains. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau "is going to go on," said Michael Gould, president of Giorgio Beverly 
Hills, which supplies fragrances to the company's department stores. "It's just 
going to be run by different people." 
</P>
<P>
Within months after Robert Campeau toasted his Federated acquisition, his plans 
began to unravel. The organization was hurt by softness in women's apparel 
sales and the disappointing purchase prices it collected upon selling its Ann 
Taylor and Gold Circle chains. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beset by high expenses and lackluster sales, the company burned up 
its working capital. Last September, Campeau Corp. moved to stave off disaster 
by putting up for sale its crown jewel, Bloomingdale's. It also launched 
efforts to buy back its $2.4 billion in junk bond debt at a discount to cut 
interest expenses, sending the junk bond market into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 12, Allied and Federated warned in a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that they might have to file for protection from creditors 
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if lenders didn't reschedule their 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects looked even worse 10 days later when a syndicate led by New York's 
Citibank threatened to call in its $2.34 billion in loans if Federated and 
Allied did not demonstrate their solvency by this Monday. There was no 
indication whether Thursday's announcement would satisfy the banks. 
</P>
<P>
The long-apparent prospect of a bankruptcy filing complicated, at times, 
Campeau's efforts to turn itself around. Efforts to sell the glitzy, 17-store 
Bloomingdale's chain were hindered, sources said, by concerns among would-be 
buyers that a deal might eventually be voided or altered by a bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's attracted interest from about a half-dozen parties, including 
groups led by Marvin Traub, chairman of Bloomingdale's, and Joseph E. Brooks, 
chairman of the Ann Taylor chain. Others who expressed interest included real 
estate developer Donald Trump, along with JMB Realty Corp., a big Chicago-based 
real estate syndicator, and Japan's TokyuCQ Department Store Co. 
</P>
<P>
But sources said that all of the offers were less than $1 billion, far below 
the purchase price of more than $1.2 billion sought by Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau negotiators also tried, unsuccessfully, to use the threat of bankruptcy 
as a cudgel to win concessions from holders of its junk bond debt. The company 
tried to buy back the bonds at a sharp discount, in part by raising the 
probability that bond holders would suffer even more if they waited months or 
perhaps years for a bankruptcy judge to rule on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, the question of who was steering Campeau has been in question. 
The Reichmann brothers appeared to become the most influential shareholders. By 
virtue of providing the $250 million in financing in September, they acquired 
or gained the right to acquire 38.4% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Canada, however, emerged with the equivalent a 22.5% stake 
this month when it seized about half of Robert Campeau's holdings when two of 
his personal companies defaulted on loans. Meanwhile, Campeau continued to hold 
a 20.7% stake. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., an Ohio shopping mall developer who helped Campeau buy 
Federated, also played a role as a key creditor and holder of a 7.5% in the 
Federated unit itself.

Geffen Balks at Sale: David Geffen disavowed a published report that he was 
"entertaining" bids as high as $800 million from Paramount Communications and 
other potential buyers for his Geffen Records music label. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have tried to get me to sell, and I've not said yes," Geffen said. 
He added: "I don't know that I will now or in the future. Nobody has made me an 
offer I couldn't refuse." A Paramount spokesman declined to comment on the 
report. Geffen distributes its records through Time Warner Inc. under a deal 
that is set to expire in the next year.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: NEW IDEAS TO HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Applegate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Computerized catalogues and multiline cordless telephones are two new products 
designed to help small businesses improve customer service in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Xentek, a Vista, Calif.-based power supply maker recently launched its 
catalogue-on-a-disk as a way to encourage computer designers and engineers to 
include Xentek power supplies in their new computers and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Trenberth, Xentek's former marketing director, sat down with advertising 
executive Peggy Lefebvre to figure out a way to "add pizazz" to Xentek's 
marketing program. Because Trenberth and Lefebvre are both technically 
oriented, they decided to put Xentek's 32-page product catalogue on a computer 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea was to have the disk become an electronic salesman that would help 
educate customers about the products," said Lefebvre, whose Anaheim advertising 
agency specializes in helping high technology clients promote their products 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue-on-a-disk idea has met with such positive response from clients 
that Lefebvre has set up a division in her agency to produce computerized 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
And Trenberth has left Xentek to open her own Vista-based business called 
Teledisk. She said Teledisk will specialize in developing software programs for 
putting catalogue information on computer disks. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is not totally new. A few years ago, Trenberth said Motorola 
released its product catalogue on a computer disk, but did not do much to 
promote it. 
</P>
<P>
Trenberth said any company with a catalogue of 20 pages or more could save 
money by putting the information on a computer disk. She said the major expense 
is paying a computer programmer to put the catalogue information on a disk. In 
Xentek's case, the job went to a staff member. After that, updating the disk is 
simple and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs about $1.80 a copy to produce a two-color, 36-page catalogue, 
compared with about 82 cents to produce each computer disk," said Trenberth. 
She said the computerized catalogues are designed to be easy to use even by 
people not totally comfortable with computers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, response from Xentek's customers to its 5 1/4 -inch floppy "Powerdisk" 
computerized catalogue has been positive, Trenberth said. One computer company 
recently asked for six Powerdisks so every engineer could keep one next to his 
or her computer. Currently, Xentek customers who select products from the 
Powerdisk call in their orders by telephone, but Trenberth said eventually 
orders could be placed over phone lines with the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Trenberth said any company with an inventory of products to sell should 
consider making product information available on a disk in addition to or 
instead of a printed catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Cordless telephones have been around for a while, but last month American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph released a new, multiline Merlin model designed 
specifically for busy small businesses. Unlike the single-line home version, 
the new phone can handle up to five lines simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Morris, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said the new cordless phone was developed 
to enhance the Merlin phone system, which is designed to serve small businesses 
needing two to 100 phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Mitchell, owner of Lew Mitchell's Orient restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard 
in Los Angeles, was among the first AT&amp;T customers to buy the cordless 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business is based on service," said Mitchell. "People come here to eat, 
but they also come here to do business." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of asking customers to walk across the room to accept calls, he brings 
the phone to their table. 
</P>
<P>
"I just walk in there and say, 'This is for you,"' said Mitchell. "I can leave 
the phone on the table and trust him not to call Uganda." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who paid about $500 each for the phones, said he considers them a 
good investment. 
</P>
<P>
Other phone makers also offer multiline cordless phones. For example, Radio 
Shack has a two-line model for about $160. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where the Hot Prospects Will Be in the New Decade 
</P>
<P>
Children's fitness centers, senior day-care centers and sock shops are among 
the hot business prospects for the 1990s, according to Entrepreneur magazine. 
Kiddie gyms are popping up across the country, as are day-care centers designed 
to care for elderly people. These senior centers provide a lower cost 
alternative to home care for ambulatory seniors who enjoy being part of a 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Brew pubs, which are restaurants with small beer breweries, are also a good 
investment. On the West Coast, the number of brew pubs has grown from 50 to 82 
in recent years. (Gorky's Restaurant in Hollywood is one of the newer ones.) 
</P>
<P>
Mobile automotive services and home inspection services are also attractive 
business opportunities, according to the magazine's editors. 
</P>
<P>
Selling bottled water is also a good way to make money, since the sale of 
bottled water doubled from $1 billion in 1985 to $2 billion in 1988. The 
public's interest in health, combined with the taste of some local tap waters, 
has encouraged new bottled water companies to compete against the industry 
veterans, Sparkletts and Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
If you like children, opening a day-care center has great potential this year. 
Currently, about 2 million children are spending their time in 65,000 
child-care centers across the country. But, every month, more mothers return to 
work and are looking for somewhere safe and stimulating to leave their 
children. Being a wedding or event planner is also an option for the 1990s 
because people are too busy to organize things themselves. Or if you are a 
computer whiz, there will be about 8 million home computers sold this year, and 
most of those new buyers will need training and instruction.

BUSINESSLAND INC. TO CUT 200 JOBS IN RESTRUCTURING

<TEXT>
<P>
Businessland Inc., a personal computer retailer, announced plans Thursday to 
cut about 200 jobs in a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland said it would make a one-time staff reduction of 5% to 7% of its 
3,900 worldwide work force, meaning a loss of from 195 to 273 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the cuts were due to recent acquisitions and streamlining 
through a multimillion-dollar investment in automating information systems and 
field distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland, which resells personal computers and workstations to a mostly 
corporate market, did not indicate where the jobs would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose-based company, which reported soft sales in its first quarter 
ended last Sept. 30, said the restructuring is targeted to take advantage of 
cost savings from new management information systems and ongoing consolidation 
of distribution operations. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland, founded in 1982, reported sales last year of $1.2 billion. The 
company said sales growth remains strong, with revenue estimated at more than 
$370 million for the second quarter ended Dec. 31.

Allowing local phone companies to provide cable television and computerized 
information services could stifle development of the unfolding information age 
while depriving low-income, disabled, elderly and rural customers of services 
they need, a coalition of consumer groups argued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A report prepared for the Consumer Federation of America and the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons disputes phone company arguments that federal rules and 
regulations should be eased to let them become the single electronic doorway 
into households -- carrying not only conversations and computer data but new 
video information services and cable television as well. 
</P>
<P>
The report marks an opening shot in what many observers believe will develop 
into a major political and consumer battle. The seven regional Bell telephone 
companies, which include San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, are prodding 
Congress to free them from restrictions of the agreement that broke up the old 
Bell System and from strictures in the 1984 Cable Act that prevent them from 
owning cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected to consider removing the restrictions this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the consumer report argues against "centralizing" information power in 
huge, computerized switches owned by local phone companies instead of 
maintaining a "decentralized" system in which they serve as conduits for phone 
and computer services. The report claimed that a centralized, single-wire 
system would inflate, not reduce, costs; stifle entrepreneurial innovation, and 
benefit chiefly those best able to pay higher prices. One result would be to 
create information "have-nots," including low-income people, the elderly and 
rural residents, the report claimed. 
</P>
<P>
A Bell Atlantic spokesman disputed the validity of the report's "either-or" 
depiction.

A state-owned East German company has agreed to buy a small U.S. distributor of 
printing machinery in what officials said Thursday was the first foreign 
acquisition by a state-run East German firm. 
</P>
<P>
Veb Kombinat Polygraph Leipzig Werner Lambertz, a maker of printing machinery 
for the graphic arts industry, has agreed to buy its U.S. importer and 
distributor, Royal Zenith Inc. of Great Neck, N.Y., for $25 million, according 
to the West German bank financing the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Zenith was sold by Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp., a New York-based investment 
firm. DKM did not require any U.S. government approval to sell Royal Zenith, 
which it had owned for about 10 years, said John Fitzsimons, DKM's general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Zenith, which has been renamed Planeta North America Inc., has been 
Polygraph's sole U.S. distributor for about 30 years, said Allan Malachuk, 
president of the U.S. company.

FORD AEROSPACE EXECUTIVES MEET TO WEIGH FIRM'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top executives at Ford Aerospace are meeting today at company headquarters in 
Newport Beach, and Donald Rassier, president of the firm, is expected to 
discuss the company's sale -- in whole or part -- by parent Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Company sources said the early-morning meeting will include all the top 
executives of the defense and space company, and officials including Rassier 
will then fly to the Bay Area to meet with managers at the firm's facilities in 
the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the impending sale of the company began to emerge in late December, and 
reports last week indicated that a final decision would be made by Ford 
directors at a board meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The company has declined to comment on the reports, and no announcement was 
made after the board meeting. Ford's stock climbed 50 cents to $45 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace has revenue of about $2 billion and says it is profitable, 
though Ford does not provide financial information about the subsidiary. The 
Aeronutronics division in Newport Beach manufactures tactical weapons systems, 
including the Sidewinder and Chapparal heat-seeking missiles, and employs 2,700 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon budget cuts are expected to result in hard times for many defense 
contractors, and analysts say Ford is eager to marshal its resources in the 
face of intensifying international competition in the automobile business. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler announced recently that it would sell its defense operations, though 
General Motors has said it has no intention of shedding its huge Hughes 
Aircraft unit. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Demisch, a defense analyst at UBS Securities, said "it would be 
logical" for Ford to sell its defense business, noting that the firm had made a 
major commitment in buying Jaguar and was generally facing a tough auto market. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts note that it might be difficult to sell a defense business in the 
current climate: "Who would want to buy them? Who would want to buy any defense 
contractor now?," asked Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that Ford Aerospace might fetch anywhere from $1.5 billion 
to $2 billion, and the list of companies commonly cited as possible buyers 
includes Boeing, Martin Marietta, TRW, Rockwell, Hughes and Lockheed. Foreign 
firms, especially Alcatel of France, might also be interested, though they 
could run into political problems because 70% of Ford Aerospace's business is 
with the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
Ford might also choose to sell some segments of the business on its own, or 
spin off parts of the unit to management or shareholders, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the weapons division based in Newport Beach, Ford Aerospace has 
satellite manufacturing, ground systems, and satellite tracking and control 
operations in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. It also does engineering and support 
work for the NASA space center in Houston, and manages training ranges for the 
military out of its technical support division in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Ford Aerospace bought BDM Inc., a Washington-area defense consulting 
and engineering organization, for $425 million in what some had believed was an 
indication of renewed commitment to the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggest that a buyer might keep some pieces of the business and 
sell others, since the divisions operate on an independent basis.

Craig Holmes was pedaling south on Balboa Avenue in the Granada Hills area last 
year when he suddenly found himself flung off his expensive racing bike and 
into the world of bicycle accident litigation. 
</P>
<P>
As the amateur marathon cyclist crossed the intersection of Rinaldi Street on 
the 20-mile commute to his job as a brewery supervisor, a car turned into the 
path of another car. The second driver decided it would be better to ram into 
the bike than to be hit by the other auto, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes was dragged and bounced along the road for 80 feet. Rough pavement broke 
his glasses and skinned his lips, face and left side. "It was like somebody 
lighting me on fire, my clothes burned into my skin so I couldn't even bleed," 
he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It took $800 to repair his expensive racing bike, hundreds more to heal his own 
wounds. In the end, he won a generous out-of-court settlement with the driver's 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
More than 89 million Americans rode bicycles last year, many lured to the sport 
by the country's fixation with health, flashy new bicycle technology and 
clothes and the star status of competing cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
But while cycling has been elevated in status, so too has it become 
increasingly risky. More than 900 bicyclists were killed last year, including 
138 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Another 500,000 ended up in hospital emergency rooms across the country -- 
suffering scrapes that cyclists call "road rash," as well as dislocated 
shoulders, smashed knees, broken bones and brain injuries. Half of the victims 
are children under 16. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more bike riders collide on the streets with car-loving citizens, 
they call on a new breed of attorney to help them seek damages. 
</P>
<P>
Known as bike lawyers, they specialize in bicycle law, advertise in bicycle 
magazines and ride to accident scenes on their own bikes to better understand 
the mechanics of the accident. Once in court, they call forth an array of 
product and safety experts who, in great detail, explain why the pedal fell 
off, why the tire left its fork and why the bicyclist could not get out of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Among the handful of Los Angeles bike attorneys is William Harris, whose first 
client seven years ago was his 14-year-old daughter, DeDe. She had been 
training for a national track championship when she was hit by a motorist 
turning left in front of her. The accident sidelined her from competition. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the insurance company wanted to treat the claim "like a 
run-of-the-mill whiplash case." The first settlement offer was low, he said, 
but he received a better one when he established that she had lost the chance 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
In untangling the case, Harris found that "police, personal injury experts and 
insurance adjusters just didn't understand the mechanics of bike accidents." So 
Harris, who bicycles more than a 100 miles a week, began to advertise in bike 
magazines and was surprised by the large response. He receives about a dozen 
inquiries a week, most involving serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Bicyclers are often treated like second-class citizens, even though legally 
they have the same responsibilities and rights that motorists do," Harris said. 
"Problems arise because motorists don't know where they are supposed to be in 
relationship to bikers." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of accidents are the fault of motorists who do not understand or 
respect bicyclists' rights, federal traffic safety experts say. But other 
accidents are caused by faulty equipment and poorly designed bike paths. Often, 
bicyclists themselves are their own enemy, failing to heed road rules or wear 
safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Except for most freeways, where they are outlawed, bicyclers have the same 
access to the roads as do cars. They are required to ride with traffic and as 
far to the right as possible, except to pass slow-moving vehicles, avoid debris 
or when the lanes are substandard widths. 
</P>
<P>
While attorneys for insurance companies argue that bicyclists have accidents 
because they break laws or are inexperienced, National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration statistics show that in most car-bicycle accidents involving 
riders over 16, the motorist usually is at fault. In those involving children 
under 16, however, the child usually is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
A tactic of insurance companies, bike lawyers claim, is to zero in on the 
alleged negligence of bicyclists, asking why they weren't wearing a helmet, 
weren't acrobatic enough to avoid the collision, or by even trying to show that 
bicyclists are "weird people." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ryan, a Los Angeles-area toy designer, said that after her bicycle 
accident in Redondo Beach in 1985, she was chastised by police and given 
inadequate legal representation. Crossing the street with the light in a 
crosswalk, Ryan said she was hit by a motorist turning left. "I was airborne 
for at least 10 feet and landed on my knees. I had a concussion, neck and back 
injuries and ended up having surgery on both knees." 
</P>
<P>
While in the emergency room, Ryan said, the investigating police officer 
lectured her. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude was that bikes don't belong on the streets and that I should have 
yielded to the car. He wrote up an unfavorable report, even though I had the 
right of way." 
</P>
<P>
The first attorney who handled her case, she said, didn't understand how 
vehicle codes pertained to bicyclists. "I lost the case in non-binding 
arbitration because she didn't explain that I was in the bike path when it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bike lawyer Harris is now handling her case. She has had more than $15,000 in 
medical bills, has been unable to climb steps, has problems with her neck and 
jaw, and has been afraid to ride on the streets. "I keep reliving that 
accident," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most lawsuits filed by injured bicyclists are settled out of court. The 
settlements often start at around $5,000 and work their way upward as the 
severity of the accident increases, some in the $250,000 range. Brain-injured 
bicyclists win the highest awards because lifetime care runs into the millions. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest awards was $8 million recently given to a Midwestern boy who 
suffered brain damage after falling from his bike when the wheel fell off on a 
railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
"How to survive is becoming the bottom line," said Alex LaRiviere, who has 
worked for the National Safety Council on bike safety and who investigates 
accidents for bicycle attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The second-generation owner of a San Jose bike store, LaRiviere said, "My 
father thinks someday all these investigations will do something to my mind. 
Already, I sometimes find it difficult to be a retailer and know that bicyclers 
are getting killed and mangled out there." Such accidents are beginning to 
generate calls for safer equipment, more and better designed bike paths, and 
increased education for bicyclists and motorists. In one program, errant 
bicyclists in Palo Alto are ticketed and must attend traffic school. Most 
emphasis has been placed on helmets, which studies show could prevent 85% of 
all brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst accidents occurred last year on the bicycle lane of U.S. 101 
near the Gaviota rest stop in Santa Barbara County. Five members of a race team 
had just completed a 60-mile training ride in the early morning and were 
returning home when a drunk driver crossed the white line separating cars from 
bikes and slammed into the group. 
</P>
<P>
Harold (Chip) Wessburg, a triathlete and race team coach, was killed. Ken 
Foraker, a highly ranked racer, lost a leg, and others received minor injuries. 
Recently a jury found Douglas Bishop, 57, guilty of second-degree murder and 
sentenced him to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has also had its share of gruesome accidents. Don Hendricks, a 
Fullerton College art professor, suffered fatal head injuries when a car 
slammed into him as he rode his cycle to work early one morning last February. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Pulley, a popular eighth-grader from Huntington Beach, was killed when 
she pedaled her father's bike into the path of an oncoming car while on the way 
to her job as a horse exerciser at a local stable on the last day of 
Thanksgiving weekend, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the cyclist hit in May by a car driven by a 76-year-old woman in 
Orange. The woman apparently never saw Francisco Rodriguez as she made a right 
turn, only stopping the car after she heard scraping sounds coming from the 
vehicle's undercarriage. Rodriguez, who suffered severe cuts and crushed lungs, 
died before rescue crews could pull him from beneath the car. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Staiger of Los Angeles has fought them on the streets and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Staiger, who logs thousands of miles a year on her bicycle, had qualified for 
the grueling transcontinental Race Across America in 1987 when she was hit on 
her bicycle at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Temescal Canyon in 
Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going about 12 m.p.h. and had proceeded through the intersection with 
the green light," she recalled. "I saw the car sitting at the red light. The 
driver looked right at me. But the next thing I know, she puts on the gas and 
runs into my bike. I go head over the bike and skid down the road on my 
helmet." 
</P>
<P>
Staiger competed in the race that year, but didn't finish. The next year, she 
won the 3,063-mile race with a time of 12 days, 3 hours and 55 minutes. She 
also won her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident she recalled, " I was coming down Palos Verdes Drive when a 
guy in a black Porsche with a little boy in the car kept honking his horn," she 
said. "I pulled as far to the right as possible, but he roars around me 
screaming. Then he hits his brakes on purpose and I had to go around him down 
the center line bumps to keep from running into him. He goes around me again 
and hits the brakes again. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, something just broke in me. At the stop light, I caught up with him. He 
had an open sunroof. Guess where my water bottle went?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it's the bicycle pathway that harms the bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles River Bike Trail near Paramount used to wind down to the 
riverbed at a spot where water pooled. A bicyclist, riding the path for the 
first time, slipped in the algae and crashed. He obtained a settlement, and the 
bikeway was eventually rerouted to avoid the water. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, bicyclists say, the paths, which also meander along the Santa Ana 
River and other routes in Orange County, are not policed to keep them clear of 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"I even saw a lady lay her baby down on the path to change its diaper," said 
Frederick Bodner, a 31-year-old Santa Monica mountain biker. Once, a leashed 
dog lunged and hit his riding partner's bike, sending him flying and bending 
the back wheel. But his worst experience, Bodner said, occurred on a Venice 
bike path, where a shop had set up a kite for an advertisement and the string 
strayed across the path. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the string pull down into my sunglasses, obscuring my vision," he 
recalled. "It cut my head, ripped my arm, slashed my jersey. I thought I was 
going to be decapitated." 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclists are not only pressing for safer pathways, they have argued for 
better equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"With new equipment coming out all the time, you get new injuries. You never 
know what is going to happen next," said bike lawyer Mace Simon of Los Angeles, 
who rides to accident sites on his own bike so that he can get a better idea of 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Product liability cases are on the upswing partly because of the popularity of 
mountain bikes and the lightweight materials used by manufacturers, attorneys 
said. Simon noted that there have been several recent cases involving breakage 
of the handlebar stem when bikers add extension bars out front to place 
themselves in a more aerodynamic position. 
</P>
<P>
Suing foreign bicycle makers for product liability is often a long and 
expensive task, said bike lawyer Harris. Unlike American firms, foreign 
companies are less likely to approve out-of-court settlements, and are willing 
to spend endless money to go to trial, bike lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Spiller, a Los Angeles attorney whose firm often defends bike 
manufacturers, contends that many suits brought by bicyclists are unwarranted 
and the result of "user error and lack of common sense." He said that given the 
"litigious nature" of consumers, he expects claims to soon increase to one 
claim for every 2,000 bikes produced. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, he noted, a woman was sitting on the handlebars of a bike being 
ridden by her husband. The bike hit a rut and she flew off, landed on her head 
and died two days later. The spouse filed a $6-million suit against the company 
for failing to place a warning on the bike against riding on the handlebars. 
Spiller said he was able to extricate his client from the suit, which is still 
pending against the city of St. Joseph, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, meanwhile, are taking it on themselves to toughen laws against 
dangerous cycling practices. In Westminster, a proposed new ordinance would put 
bicyclists riding on sidewalks at fault if they collide with cars leaving or 
entering driveways. 
</P>
<P>
Safety experts believe that serious injuries could drop significantly if more 
riders would wear helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all bicycle-related deaths are caused by head injuries. Of the 500,000 
bike accident victims admitted to emergency rooms each year, more than half 
suffer head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this perception that bicycles are cute toys. You can fall off a bike 
in your driveway and lie there and die from a devastating head injury because 
you didn't have a helmet on," said David Thom, a research associate at USC's 
Department of Safety Science. 
</P>
<P>
Thom noted that good helmets have been available to consumers since 1984 when 
the American National Standards Institute came up with industry standards, but 
many bicyclists refuse to wear them because they consider them hot and 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the U.S. Cycling Federation made helmets mandatory for 
sanctioned races. In most foreign races, including the Tour de France, helmets 
are not usually worn. American Greg LeMond, who won the race last year, gave 
helmets a boost by wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Stalnaker, an engineering professor at Ohio State University, is 
doing helmet studies for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He 
said the ideal helmet is one that absorbs energy of the impact and 
disintegrates, leaving the rider protected. 
</P>
<P>
However, this concept is often lost on the juries hearing bike cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If a jury sees a helmet that went through an accident without a scratch, they 
think, 'Gee, it must be a good helmet,"' Stalnaker said. "If they see one torn 
up they say, 'No wonder he's dead.' But in reality, the helmet only remains in 
good condition if it doesn't absorb enough energy and, instead, passes it on to 
the victim's head." 
</P>
<P>
Stalnaker says: "It's easier to make helmets better than to make autos 
friendlier."

EISNER GRILLED: Thursday's Disneyland press conference was supposed to be 
nostalgic (B6), but from the media ranks came a barbed question: Won't new 
admission prices ($25.50 for adults, up 8.5%) keep families away? . . . The 
question came from Samantha Test, 11, of La Palma, "cub" reporter for the 
Irvine-based Bear Essential News for Kids and caught Disney CEO Michael Eisner 
by surprise. "That's the toughest question I've had in a year," he said with a

EARTHQUAKE PANEL PRODS CITIES ON MASONRY DANGER; 
</P>
<P>
SEISMIC SAFETY: NEWPORT BEACH, ONE OF SEVEN ORANGE COUNTY CITIES THAT HAVE 
REPORTED TO THE PANEL, LEADS THE COUNTY IN UNREINFORCED BUILDINGS WITH 127.

<P>
More than half of the cities in the most earthquake-prone parts of California 
have failed to complete the first steps toward upgrading their most dangerous 
masonry buildings, a Seismic Safety Commission report released Thursday showed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives are threatened by these buildings, and cities that have ignored the 
law or that have adopted ineffective programs are simply letting us down," 
Commission Director L. Thomas Tobin said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin said only a fourth of the 366 cities and counties in the regions most 
threatened by earthquakes have identified their masonry buildings and embarked 
on programs to bring them up to safety standards. Another 20% claim to have no 
unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin's analysis was released as the commission continued its investigation of 
the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. Officials say at least 10 of the 62 deaths 
during the quake are blamed on unreinforced masonry buildings, including five 
people who were crushed when a wall of bricks fell onto a parking lot in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Legislature passed a law calling on cities and counties to 
identify hazardous masonry buildings. They were also to adopt and begin 
implementing plans for bringing those buildings up to minimum safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The law had a Jan. 1 deadline but included no penalties for failure to comply. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the progress," Tobin said, "but on the other hand, we are 
disappointed that over half of the cities and counties covered under the law 
have yet to comply." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and several neighboring cities are in the forefront of requiring 
owners to fix their unreinforced masonry buildings. But Tobin said 49 
municipalities and counties have failed to so much as inform the commission 
about any progress they may have made. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, Monterey and Imperial counties, as well as several cities in Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, are among those that have failed to 
contact the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff is not sure of the extent of the problem in the 49 cities 
and counties that failed to respond. But the commission estimated that 
Escondido has 24 unreinforced masonry buildings, El Monte has 25, San Clemente 
35, Rialto 40 and San Gabriel 50. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Councilwoman Holly Ann Veale said Thursday night that the city did 
not report to the commission because it had not completed its tally of 
unreinforced masonry buildings. "We do not have the same resources as do larger 
cities," Veale said. "We're doing the best we can, and we hope to complete it 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Several cities identified as among those attempting to comply with the 
requirement, in fact, have a long way to go. San Francisco, for example, has 
more than 2,000 unreinforced masonry buildings, more than any other city in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven cities in Orange County that have complied with the commission's 
reporting requirement, Newport Beach has the highest number with 127 
unreinforced buildings. The others are Huntington Beach, 152; Brea, 27; Santa 
Ana, 20; Anaheim, 16; Placentia, 16, and La Habra, 15. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin called on the commission to back legislation that would penalize cities 
that failed to bring the masonry buildings up to minimum seismic safety 
standards. Such a law also would provide money for seismic upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Tobin went on to advocate extending the requirement that brick 
buildings be brought up to minimum standards to Central California and San 
Diego -- areas thought to be less threatened by earthquakes. The commission 
postponed discussion of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, University of California President David Gardner said he 
opposed suggestions that warning signs be posted on campus buildings that would 
be unsafe in major quakes. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner noted that the main libraries at UCLA and UC Berkeley are thought to be 
unsafe in major earthquakes, but he said warning signs "artificially deal with 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"What is a student to do?" Gardner asked. "They really don't have the 
discretion to go in or not go in."

DOCTORS' ESSAY DETAILS WAYS TO HEAL THE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an article in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn., three UC 
Irvine doctors and a Costa Mesa health advocate have written a primer on 
strategies for helping the poor to get medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Their essay describes the history of a 4 1/2-year-old, 50-member group, the 
Orange County Task Force on Indigent Care, and its battles with local 
bureaucrats to make medical care available to some of about 400,000 county 
residents who have no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Although their article details the efforts of one local group, the authors -- 
Howard Waitzkin, F. Allan Hubbell and Lloyd Rucker, all UCI internists, and 
Vicki Mayster, a health advocate with the SOS Free Medical Clinic in Costa Mesa 
-- say some of their tactics could be used around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every community is different, but there are some things that transfer," said 
Mayster, a former seminary student who, with Waitzkin, heads the health group. 
</P>
<P>
According to the article -- titled "Legal Advocacy for the Medically Indigent: 
Strategies and Accomplishments in One County" -- the doctors, medical 
residents, lawyers, clergy and civic volunteers in the group have used a 
three-pronged approach toward making "modest improvements" in medical programs 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Members have written medical journal reports documenting the difficulties that 
poor residents face in finding basic medical care in one of the nation's 
wealthiest counties. They have taken political action, testifying before county 
and state officials. And sometimes, the article said, they have turned to 
lawyers to argue their case. 
</P>
<P>
In all, "they have been a thorn in the side of bureaucrats," noted Chauncey 
Alexander, chairman of United Way of Orange County's Health Care Task Force, 
who has worked alongside the group's members. 
</P>
<P>
But several county officials who saw an advance copy of the article said it 
overstates the group's gains. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even sure who they are," said Marianne Maxwell, special projects 
director of the county Health Care Agency, who started the county's Indigent 
Medical Services health insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
Cautioning that she had only briefly reviewed the article, Maxwell said she 
believes that other community groups such as United Way deserve more credit for 
changing county policies toward the indigent than Waitzkin's and Mayster's. 
</P>
<P>
Mayster responded: "I don't want to claim we're taking credit for things other 
people were involved in." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the article repeatedly describes her group's members as working 
with other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the article notes, her group contributed to well-publicized and 
highly critical reports on local health care by the League of Women Voters and 
United Way. 
</P>
<P>
The group also conducted studies of its own. One, published in the 1989 
American Journal of Medical Science, showed that 94 patients, or 5% of one UCI 
clinic's caseload, did not receive such needed care as surgery, medication or 
ultrasound studies because they could not afford them. 
</P>
<P>
The article also credits the Task Force on Indigent Care with helping persuade 
county officials to sharply increase prenatal services to poor women and to 
streamline eligibility requirements for the county's Indigent Medical Services 
(IMS) program. 
</P>
<P>
It also says the group's members took part in "targeting health-care 
institutions." In 1985 and 1986, they helped "organize a broad coalition" that 
successfully opposed the sale of UC Irvine Medical Center to a for-profit 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the article says that the group lobbied to prevent medical center 
administrators from closing satellite and pediatric clinics and has used 
"limited" legal actions. An attorney for the group recently persuaded county 
officials to make a major policy change in the IMS program, for the first time 
allowing immigrants approved for amnesty to be covered by that health 
insurance. That change, the article says, "makes health care available to 
thousands of immigrants in the county." 
</P>
<P>
For all the pluses, the article also concludes that each tactic has some 
weaknesses. For example, political activity "remains basically defensive. . . . 
Efforts to maintain services at a minimum level do not lead to more creative 
and proactive programs" that would improve overall health care. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the article says, organized advocacy is a "piecemeal approach" that 
will not produce a well-organized health care system. Only a national health 
care system can do that, the authors say, and in the meantime, "we and other 
health advocates can only continue to hold the line." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Waitzkin and Mayster said, since the article was accepted by the 
medical journal, health care for Orange County's poor has deteriorated. One of 
the county's four trauma centers closed in December, poor women still have few 
places they can go to deliver their babies and, Waitzkin said, "There's been a 
whole bunch of commissions and task forces, and the only thing that has 
happened is an exchange of words." 
</P>
<P>
He and Mayster said their group is so upset with county officials, especially 
county supervisors, that they are thinking of changing strategy and becoming 
more "confrontational." 
</P>
<P>
What do they intend to do? Both declined to say.

SHOWERS EXPECTED TO WASH AWAY DENSE FOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An approaching weekend storm is expected to replace the dense fog that has 
shrouded Orange County in recent days and forced the closure of John Wayne 
Airport, stranding scores of travelers because of canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
The fog was thickest Wednesday night, when John Wayne Airport was shut down 
from 6:45 to 10:45 p.m., said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly 
Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Fog-related problems at the airport continued Thursday morning, when one flight 
was canceled and three others were rerouted, according to airline officials. 
But by Thursday night, operations were back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of Pacific storms lined up in the Gulf of Alaska is expected to 
begin sweeping across California, bringing a 30% chance of rain to Orange 
County today and a 60% chance on Saturday with windy conditions. Rain also is 
likely on Sunday, both here and in San Francisco, where the Los Angeles Rams 
meet the San Francisco 49ers for the National Football Conference championship. 
The wet weather will continue into early next week, forecasters say. 
</P>
<P>
"It does look like we could get some real rain," said Rick Dittmann, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
While the weekend storm could cause new travel delays, the promise of 
measurable rain would be a welcome relief to parched Orange County, 
experiencing its fourth straight winter of below-average rainfall. Total 
rainfall for the county since July is 1.04 inches, a third below normal, 
WeatherData officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said a changing weather pattern is the result of a developing onshore 
flow that should blow away the dense fog that has plagued the area. 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, Northwest Airlines reported that its 6:50 a.m. flight to 
Minneapolis was canceled because of low visibility. An airline spokeswoman said 
passengers were taken by shuttle bus to Los Angeles International Airport and 
placed aboard another Minnesota-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
Three other early-morning flights scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport were 
rerouted. A Northwest flight from Seattle and a Delta Airlines flight from 
Tampa, Fla., were diverted to San Diego's Lindbergh Field, while an American 
Airlines flight from Oakland landed at Ontario International Airport, where 
passengers boarded buses and were driven to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A total of eight flights bound for John Wayne, including five Wednesday night, 
were diverted because of fog to other Southern California airports over a 
two-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Edwards, a spokeswoman for John Wayne Airport, said federal 
regulations prohibit planes from landing if visibility is less than half a 
mile, and from taking off if visibility is below a quarter-mile and passengers 
are on board. 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers who were stranded at John Wayne early Thursday appeared to take 
the delays in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to read the newspaper for once and relax," said Beverly Richards, who 
was booked aboard an early-morning Northwest Airlines flight to the Bay Area. 
"I would have had to go to work when I got home, anyway. I don't mind missing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who had been attending a convention in Orange County, eventually got 
on a northbound flight that departed John Wayne at 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bauer, a Costa Mesa resident who was on his way back to his Navy post in 
Jacksonville, Fla., said he was among the lucky passengers who got advance 
warning of delays and managed to make other travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer was booked to leave from John Wayne Airport early Thursday morning, but 
changed his plans and left at 11:30 a.m. aboard an America West flight to Los 
Angeles, where he caught a connecting flight to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no big deal," Bauer said. "At least I didn't have to be here early . . 
. and wait around." 
</P>
<P>
Fog-related delays were also reported at Long Beach Airport, where three 
flights were canceled Thursday morning because of near-zero visibility. The fog 
also grounded state helicopters scheduled to spray the pesticide malathion 
Wednesday night over several San Gabriel Valley communities infested with the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
While aerial operations were sharply affected by the fog, the weather problems 
apparently did not hamper motorists. The California Highway Patrol reported no 
fog-related traffic problems in Orange County on Wednesday night or early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said the soupy fog that has blanketed the coastline and extended up to 
10 miles inland was caused by a combination of a low marine layer and a belt of 
low-lying warm air. 
</P>
<P>
"With a shallow marine layer and an inversion (a warm air mass) of around 2,000 
or 3,000 feet, you're going to get a squashed layer of clouds that goes down to 
the surface," Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The fog was so thick in spots that temperatures varied by as much as 20 degrees 
in areas of the Los Angeles basin Wednesday, Dittmann said.

JUDGE IN GIONIS CASE WON'T DISQUALIFY SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused to disqualify himself Thursday from hearing the 
child custody dispute between Dr. Thomas Gionis and his former wife, Aissa 
Wayne, rejecting Gionis' claim that the judge is biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' lawyer, Catherine A. Vincent, contended in court papers that Superior 
Court Judge Ronald E. Owen is biased in favor of the district attorney's 
office, which is prosecuting an assault case against Gionis stemming from an 
October, 1988, attack on Wayne and her then-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled for March 6. 
</P>
<P>
Owen refused to recuse himself, so another judge will hear the motion for 
disqualification. The judge has not yet been selected, and no hearing date has 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
In a written motion seeking the disqualification, Vincent focused on Owen's 
refusal last month to grant Gionis unmonitored visits with his daughter, 
2-year-old Anastasia, who lives with her mother. She also attacked the way Owen 
handled the appointment of the monitors and said Owen's friendship with Wayne's 
attorney, E. Robert Lemkin, influenced his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said Owen first approved three monitors, then immediately disapproved 
them when Lemkin noted that it could create a conflict of interest because they 
worked for the district attorney's office. If they overheard private statements 
by Gionis, he could use that to try to dismiss the assault case, Lemkin had 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
Lemkin said Thursday that Vincent's motion is unfounded because he is not 
"bosom buddies" with Owen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the judge is prejudiced," Lemkin said. "Remember, he first 
awarded custody (of Anastasia) to Dr. Gionis in the beginning. He clearly is 
not biased against him." CATHERINE GEWERTZ

WOMAN, 88, NAMES SUSPECT AS RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An 88-year-old woman on the witness stand in Orange County Superior Court on 
Thursday identified Danny Harris as the man who raped her on April 6, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 39, of Buena Park, is charged with 61 counts of rape, sexual 
molestation and burglary. The trial will be the first in Orange County in which 
a suspect's genetic makeup will be introduced as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-convict is accused of terrorizing women in several Orange County cities 
from 1985 to 1988 by breaking into their homes and sexually assaulting them. 
The 20 victims range in age from 25 to the late 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors plan to introduce results of "genetic fingerprinting" in the case. 
The tests use samples of blood, semen, body tissue or hair found found at a 
crime scene to determine if they match a suspect's. Each sample carries an 
individual's DNA pattern, a unique genetic code. Apart from identical twins, as 
few as one in several billion people share the same combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Dennis D. Bauer said prosecutors planned to introduce the 
fingerprinting because they did not know if witnesses would positively identify 
Harris. When the first witness identified Harris at his preliminary hearing 
Thursday, Bauer said, "it was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly woman said in a soft voice that the assailant pressed a 12-inch 
dagger against her neck. She could identify him, she said, because, "it was 
something that just shocked me. I had a feeling that he's the one. Something 
was telling me that I was facing the one who had raped me." 
</P>
<P>
A second witness on Thursday said she she awoke the night of April 12 to find a 
stranger standing over her and touching her. When she screamed, he fled. The 
woman, 28, said she could not positively identify Harris but that he resembled 
the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony will continue on Jan. 22. STEPHEN C. CHAVEZ

PAY, HEALTH BENEFITS STALL TEACHERS' PACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With more than 200 teachers marching and chanting outside, representatives from 
the Ocean View School District and its teachers union made little headway 
Thursday in resolving their contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
After more than seven hours of negotiations with state mediator Tom McCarthy 
and an exchange of proposals, the two sides remain "$1 million apart," said 
Gayle Wayne, assistant to the district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Halbach, president of the Ocean View Teachers Assn., said she was "very 
disappointed" with the lack of progress. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers from the district's 17 Huntington Beach schools, which serve 8,400 
students, picketed for 90 minutes in front of the district offices, carrying 
signs and chanting, "We want a contract." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy directed both sides to continue to exchange proposals next week, and 
if no settlement in the 10-week dispute is reached by next Friday, he will 
authorize a fact-finding effort, the next step in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The major issues at stake include teachers' salaries and health benefits, and 
how money from the state lottery and Proposition 98 will be spent. The union's 
latest proposal calls for a 9.3% pay raise and full health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The district countered with an offer that did not address salaries and included 
an increased contribution to health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The district paid for health care for its employees until this school year, 
when the cost of its Blue Shield plan soared 50% -- a cost that was passed on 
to the teachers. JOHN PENNER

FATHER JAILED AGAIN OVER CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph C. Codsi won a dubious distinction Thursday: He became one of the few 
people who have been jailed twice for contempt of court in a child support 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Codsi, a Cypress man who has made a crusade of refusing to pay his ex-wife 
$17,000 in child support, was taken into custody by a deputy marshal in 
Superior Court, where he had gone to deliver an eyebrow-raising letter to the 
judge who has been hearing his case. 
</P>
<P>
Codsi's letter to Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam began, "With my 
utter contempt," then went on to accuse the judge of being "stupid, incompetent 
and abusive." Codsi proclaimed himself a "dissenter and a refusenik," saying he 
is entitled to disobey the law based on his "personal feelings." 
</P>
<P>
The judge declined to discuss the letter, which was signed, "Joseph C. Codsi, a 
free man." 
</P>
<P>
Rylaarsdam issued an arrest warrant for Codsi, 56, on Tuesday when Codsi failed 
to appear for a hearing. But civil arrest warrants take a few days to process, 
so marshals had not yet been sent to his home to arrest him. Codsi's 
unannounced court visit saved them a trip. 
</P>
<P>
In a string of hearings that began last fall, Codsi steadfastly refused to 
detail his assets and unloaded a streak of insults on the judge. He was jailed 
for contempt, but his ex-wife's lawyers finally gave up and released him after 
26 days, concluding that jail time was not softening his resolve. 
</P>
<P>
When Codsi again refused to answer questions about his assets on Thursday, he 
was jailed. He has vowed never to cough up the money, saying the child support 
law is "stupid and immoral." 
</P>
<P>
Denver, Colo., attorney Thomas P. Malone, an expert on alimony and child 
support cases, said it is rare -- although not unheard of -- for someone to be 
jailed twice for refusing to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
"Most judges say it's amazing how money turns up after someone spends even a 
few hours in jail," he said. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

CHURCH GETS BREAK ON DAY-CARE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city Planning Commission voted to give a child-care program at Lutheran 
Church of the Master a six-month reprieve from a requirement that it build a 
block wall to protect neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted Monday to allow a trial period to determine whether a 
chain-link fence would provide adequate security and privacy for neighbors of 
the church at 1601 W. La Habra Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The commission had previously ordered the church to build a 6-foot-high block 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a nonprofit corporation," said church spokesman Howard Koch. "We have a 
small congregation. We're just not in a position to afford a block wall." 
</P>
<P>
Day-care director Mary Ann Borders also told the commission there is a shortage 
of day care for preschoolers in the community. The day-care program began 
operating at the end of November and serves 27 children. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners David Cheverton and Charles Taylor agreed. Taylor suggested that 
the center be allowed six months to prove its contention that the chain-link 
fence would provide adequate protection for the neighbors.

PUBLIC SEEKS A REMEDY TO AID CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a migration of hippies to Laguna Beach created the need for a free clinic 
in the late 1960s, Neal Purcell, then a police officer, wasn't one of its 
biggest fans. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Police Chief Purcell is among those working to save that financially 
troubled Laguna Beach Community Clinic, which serves people from all over 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A public meeting will be held Saturday at City Hall beginning at 10 a.m. to 
discuss ideas to raise money for the clinic. City officials called the meeting 
after they voted to forgive a $20,000 loan to the clinic, which has 
subsequently reduced its deficit from $60,000 to about $30,000, said Ronald 
Woelfle, president of its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now trying to increase public awareness of what we do," he said. "If I 
leave any legacy, it'll be for the clinic not to face another crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Purcell, who has watched the clinic grow and change since it opened in 1970, 
said: "Hopefully, these talks will attract people from outside (of the city) to 
be supportive. A lot of people say, 'Why does affluent Laguna Beach need a 
clinic like this?' But this is a clinic for the entire area. I'd hate to see it 
fold." 
</P>
<P>
Purcell admits that he didn't feel that way in the late 1960s, when thousands 
of young people came to Laguna Beach, seeking the mild weather and 
permissiveness associated with the renowned artists' colony. 
</P>
<P>
Venereal disease and drug overdoses were near epidemic then, Purcell said. So 
community doctors, dentists and church leaders proposed a free clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from residents who feared that it would draw more hippies to 
the small seaside hamlet, the Laguna Beach Free Clinic opened in a converted 
two-bedroom-and-den home at 460 Ocean Ave. 
</P>
<P>
"The town was inundated with hippie types, dopers and transients," Purcell 
said. "That was the major clientele when it first opened." 
</P>
<P>
"I was not for it" then, he said. "I thought it would create more problems than 
resolve them. But now it would be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, services were added to the original birth control and venereal 
disease services. Flu shots, dentistry, psychological counseling, a rape crisis 
and family violence unit and legal counseling werea added. A blood pressure 
clinic, school and work physicals and a prenatal care program were also 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell said the most noticeable shift came in 1975 when the clinic started 
serving the elderly, including people from Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
"Gradually, it started shifting from serving transients in Laguna Beach to all 
segments of the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 11,000 people pass through the doors each year from as far away as Brea 
and Buena Park, Woelfle said. But the price of that service has been financial 
trouble for several years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the clinic faced a $40,000 deficit and possible closure. The city then 
gave it an interest-free, $30,000 loan. The clinic changed its name to the 
Laguna Beach Community Clinic and began charging fees on a sliding scale. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were still losing funding from the public domain," Woelfle said. "We 
had a crisis a year and were literally on the doors of bankruptcy last 
October." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the clinic has become "leaner and meaner, but not to our clients," 
Woelfle said. "We're doing more with less. We are much more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
Paid staff has been cut to 10 people, and more than 250 volunteers donate 
35,000 hours a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And there are so many other things people can do," Woelfle said. "We need 
volunteers for scheduling, the front desk and fund-raising events." LESLIE

POLICE DONATING OLD UNIFORMS TO MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The uniforms that once outfitted the city's 330-member police force will soon 
be seen on the streets of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police changed the color of their uniforms from tan to blue last year, 
leaving the department with about 2,500 unwanted sets of tan shirts and pants. 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of good will, most of the uniforms will be donated to needy law 
enforcement agencies in Mexico, Capt. Randy Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
Local police occasionally work with Mexican authorities to catch suspects who 
flee the United States, Gaston said, and police officials hope the donation of 
uniforms will increase cooperation on these cases. Such cooperation must be 
solicited since there is no legal requirement for Mexican police to assist with 
investigations of crimes committed in this country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the uniforms have been given to charity or destroyed. The uniforms 
are worth less than $100 each, according to Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
Following the City Council's approval of the donation, the Police Department 
will decide which Mexican police agencies will receive the uniforms, Gaston 
said. In addition, some uniforms and other equipment such as batons will be 
donated to the police academy at Golden West College.

APPLY KING TEACHINGS TO DRUGS, POVERTY, SEMINAR TOLD

In the keynote address of a three-day symposium honoring Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. on Thursday night, a prominent educator urged the audience of a packed 
church on the campus of UC Irvine not to "freeze" the memory of the late civil 
rights leader but to apply his teachings to today's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jawanza Kunjufu, founder of African-American Images, a Chicago-based 
publishing and consulting firm that deals mainly with academic achievement 
among black youths, said that society has failed to apply King's message of 
nonviolent resistance to the problems of poverty and drug abuse that plague 
inner cities and the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now in Los Angeles and Chicago and other cities . . . we're losing 
between 300 and 1,000 brothers a year to homicide," Kunjufu said. "We need to 
be able to use whatever Dr. King said between 1929 and 1968 (King's lifetime) 
to deal with our homicide problem today." 
</P>
<P>
While praising King's work, Kunjufu also said he believed that King made a 
mistake during the civil rights movement in not continuing the 381-day 
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1956. Continuing the boycott, Kunjufu said, 
could possibly have led to the establishment of a black-owned transportation 
service and set the civil rights movement on a course toward economic 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, we need to realize that maybe freedom is starting our own 
businesses," Kunjufu said in his lecture at the University United Methodist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights movement, he said, also failed to use federal grants in the 
1960s to further black-owned businesses and institutions, a fault that is now 
manifesting itself in economic problems facing African-American communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to use that (grant) money to create some goods and services, so when 
the money leaves, fine," Kunjufu said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times before his speech, Kunjufu also emphasized the 
point of economic advancement among African-Americans. His consulting firm, 
which he founded in 1980, promotes that notion by urging school systems around 
the country to raise self-esteem among black youths. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at the issue of education, and ultimately empowerment of our 
own community," Kunjufu said. "We still look to others for basic goods and 
services." 
</P>
<P>
African-American Images, he said, seeks to further self-esteem among blacks and 
advance academic achievement by targeting youths as early as the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are concerned about black men who are 18 or 20 hanging out on 
the street corners," Kunjufu said. "My concern was, let's try to catch it 
before it starts. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug problem is caused by low self-esteem," he added. "You don't deal and 
use drugs if you feel good about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
UCI's symposium honoring King -- who would have been 61 years old Monday -- 
concludes today with a march through Irvine to the campus starting at 10 a.m. 
at Mason Park and followed by a noon rally at the school's Gateway Plaza.

BECKMAN GIVES $6.2 MILLION TO UCI LASER CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
PHILANTHROPY: GIFT IS THE LARGEST RECEIVED IN THE UNIVERSITY'S HISTORY. IT 
LAUNCHES A CAMPUSWIDE CAMPAIGN TO RAISE ITS ENDOWMENT TO $200 MILLION.

The UC Irvine Beckman Laser Institute received the largest single cash 
contribution in the university's history Thursday as the Arnold and Mabel 
Beckman Foundation of Corona del Mar presented the medical clinic with $6.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The gift launches a campuswide campaign that officials hope will bring in more 
than $200 million over the next few years and continued support from the Orange 
County community. 
</P>
<P>
"This gift is most exciting because it assures the institute the funding 
necessary to remain at the forefront of laser biomedicine," said the 
institute's director and co-founder, Dr. Michael Berns. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the donation -- $5.2 million -- will be directed toward the 
institute's research endowment, while the remaining portion will complete a 
pledge made last year by the Beckman foundation to support new research 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
The gift brings the laser institute's endowment to more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The laser institute, which is named for Dr. Arnold O. Beckman, is reported to 
be the first facility in the world where laser research and treatment take 
place side by side. The $7-million building that houses the clinic was 
specially designed around lasers, which number more than 30, with a special 
lasers distribution system, portable lasers and special walls to diffuse an 
ill-directed light beam. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, who has contributed more than $11 million to the institute since its 
inception in 1982, said he is continuing his support of the clinic to further 
the research of laser technology and to ensure the clinic's international 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been especially pleased by the progress made toward establishing the 
laser institute as an internationally recognized facility," Beckman said. "The 
institute has become renowned for the quality of its research. Scientists come 
here from all over the world to participate in collaborative projects. It's 
serving as a model for the creation of laser facilities in Europe and the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County philanthropist has reportedly donated more than $160 million 
during the past five years to medical and science research around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, who suffers from hearing loss, added that he was also pleased about 
the institute's research into optic fiber laser surgery within the inner ear to 
correct impaired hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which also receives $2 million in government grants each year, 
uses lasers to reshape human corneas, treat infertility in women, remove 
birthmarks from children, and diagnose and treat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Along with adding three senior-level scientists to the clinic staff, 
administrators say they also hope to establish with the Beckman gift an 
in-house residency program that will allow scientists from around the world to 
join in research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This endowment provides us the flexibility to continue to do highly innovative 
research and collaborate with other top institutions," Berns said. "To attract 
top talent, you must have the funds." 
</P>
<P>
UCI received more than $32.8 million in private gifts during the 1988-89 school 
year, making it Orange County's largest fund-raiser, according to UCI spokesman 
Scott Nelson.

ADULT-ORIENTED-BUSINESS CURBS PROPOSED

<P>
A series of proposals aimed at curbing some of the problems caused by 
adult-oriented businesses have been unveiled and could lead to new restrictions 
on adult bookstores, peep shows, billiard parlors and businesses serving 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
At a study session Wednesday night, City Manager George Tindall and 
administrative analyst Catherine C. Standiford presented the City Council with 
what they termed a "matrix" of proposed changes in city ordinances and policies 
for dealing with adult uses and businesses regulated by the state Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible changes are restrictions on the number of hours the adult 
bookstores and peep shows may operate (many are open 24 hours a day), and 
zoning regulations that would space the businesses farther apart. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed changes include requiring a conditional-use permit for adult 
uses, or possibly changing the zoning along Garden Grove Boulevard to 
residential or commercial zones that do not allow adult-only uses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all agree with these in concept," said Councilman Robert F. Dinsen 
at the conclusion of the study session. Many of the recommendations are 
expected to be brought back to the council later for formal action. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove has seven adult bookstores and peep shows, and the city has 
battled for years to regulate those businesses, all of which are located along 
Garden Grove Boulevard. Tindall said that in the area between Beach Boulevard 
and Magnolia Street, the crime rate is 50% higher than other areas of the 
thoroughfare, and twice as high as the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program of changes is "not going to get rid of adult uses. It's going to 
give us better control of them," Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members were not in favor of creating a special zone for adult uses, 
like the notorious "combat zone" in Boston in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to Boston and seen the combat zone," said Councilman Frank Kessler, 
a former chief of police. "It was appropriately named. Believe me, you don't 
want a 'combat zone' in Garden Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Also coming under scrutiny were billiard parlors and pool halls, which have 
proliferated in the city with the influx of Southeast Asian residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime doesn't necessarily happen in the billiard parlors," said Police Chief 
John Robertson, "but crimes such as shootings have happened nearby, and they 
have become a hangout for local gangs."

LA HABRA BANK HIT BY $3,880 ROBBERY; MAN, GIRL ARRESTED

<P>
Authorities arrested a 24-year-old Covina man and a 17-year-old girl Thursday 
about two hours after a La Habra bank was robbed of $3,880. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina police arrested Mark Anthony Alvarado of Covina and his companion 
at her West Covina residence, said La Habra Police Lt. John Buchholz. 
</P>
<P>
A man brandishing a handgun entered the Security Pacific Bank branch in the 200 
block of South Beach Boulevard around 10:20 a.m., announced the robbery, and 
ordered a teller to stuff an envelope with cash, Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
The man then dashed out of the bank and jumped into a black 1976 Volkswagen 
beetle driven by a young woman, Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said officers recovered $1,300 in cash that the suspect dropped as he 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina police saw a car matching the getaway vehicle's description parked 
in front of a residence and arrested the two suspects without incident, 
Buchholz said. They were turned over to La Habra police. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said that when police made the arrests they found an additional $700 
that they believe came from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and was being held at 
Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. Buchholz added that there was also 
a no-bail hold on the West Covina man for a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being detained at 
Juvenile Hall.

PREP BASKETBALL: JOE EIMERS HAS HAD 11 OPERATIONS, BUT HE STILL MANAGES TO PLAY 
FOR SANTA MARGARITA HIGH SCHOOL'S JUNIOR VARSITY TEAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Eimers has the face of a cherub and the knees of a war veteran. 
</P>
<P>
You look at him with his large blue eyes, round cheeks and tousled, straight 
brown hair and you remember the triumphs and trials of being 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But then you see his knees. 
</P>
<P>
On his left knee, there are four scars, each nearly two inches long. Near his 
right knee is another scar, this one more than six inches long and an inch 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
The scars are a result of 11 knee operations in the last five years for Eimers, 
who first injured his knees and broke his leg in a bicycle accident when he was 
9. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Eimers runs on these knees every day as a member of the Santa Margarita 
High School junior varsity basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on my bike," Eimers said of the accident. "I live on a cul-de-sac, and 
there was a camper on the corner. I had to go out in the middle of the street 
to avoid it, but there was a car coming down the street and it swerved, and I 
swerved, and I hit it." 
</P>
<P>
The main problem in Eimers' case was his age, said Dr. Stephen Bayley, an 
orthopedic surgeon and director of the sports medicine clinic at Pomona Valley 
Hospital. Because he was still growing, the cartilage was in danger of healing 
with bone rather than cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
"So you have to go in and straighten it out," Bayley said. "And then it grows 
crooked again, and you have to go in again." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Eimers started playing basketball soon after the accident. Last 
year, he went out for the freshman team at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
"At tryouts, I noticed this kid, limping," said Rich Schaaf, varsity coach at 
Santa Margarita. "It almost made me sick to look at his knees -- you can just 
see he's got to be in pain when he walks or runs. 
</P>
<P>
"But Joe has this attitude of 'whatever anybody else does, I'll do,' and he did 
everything (the coaches) asked of him." 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Eimers scored one point on a team that finished 19-6. "It was 
funny, the way he scored," JV Coach John Lester said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the day before he went in for knee surgery. In the last few seconds of 
the game, another small boy, Danny Donovan, got fouled, then threw Joe the ball 
and ran down to the other end of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The ref didn't know who got fouled, gave Joe the ball and he made his free 
throw." 
</P>
<P>
Eimers, who is 5-feet-6, continues to work out to strengthen his knees. And he 
remains upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"After a surgery or two ago," he said, "I just knew it was going to be better." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, he nearly became manager of the football team, but then decided he 
wanted to play sports, not just watch. And the only sport he wanted to play was 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went out for basketball because it looked like fun," Eimers said. "I 
like to play golf, casually. I watch football on TV, but I like basketball. I 
have no desire to play any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I play with friends around my neighborhood -- I can beat everybody except my 
next-door neighbor, and I'm working on him." 
</P>
<P>
Eimers cannot straighten his right knee, so he has changed his running style, 
favoring his left foot, turning his right foot inward to compensate. And 
although it might look strange, it works well for Eimers. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts after I've been running constantly but otherwise it's OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eimers scored his first three points of the season last weekend against Valley 
Christian. "The kids just went crazy," Schaaf said. "The whole crowd likes 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Schaaf said Eimers' cheerful, never-say-die attitude has ensured his spot on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget, about this time last year -- it was a Monday -- his dad 
came in and said something had gone wrong, and Joe was going to have to have 
another operation," Schaaf said. "Of course I figured that was the end of his 
high school basketball career. But about a month and a half later, I see Joe in 
the weight room, doing squats. And then he went out for the team again. I 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, in only its third year of existence, has five basketball 
teams: varsity, junior varsity, sophomore and two freshman teams. Instead of 
keeping Eimers on the sophomore team, Schaaf bumped him up to junior varsity 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's real smart," Schaaf said. "His handicap -- although I'm sure he doesn't 
consider it a handicap -- forces him to be smart. Nobody can tell him he's not 
considered a player like the other kids -- we need good attitudes as well as 
good players." 
</P>
<P>
Eimers said he was surprised and pleased at the promotion, but all he really 
cares about is his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know if I was going to be on the sophomore team, but just before 
the season, Coach told me I was going to be on JV. I was pretty stoked," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope the team wins."

Capistrano Valley Christian High School was awarded a forfeit over Brethren 
Thursday when the Olympic League girls' basketball game was stopped after the 
Brethren team was pulled from the court by its coach in a dispute over 
officiating.

<P>
Capistrano Valley Christian led, 37-19, when the game was stopped at the end of 
the third quarter. The Brethren coach was called for a technical foul in the 
second quarter and another in the third. She was ejected for arguing with the 
referee, according to Tim Shelton, Capistrano Valley Christian coach.

PHOENIX GROUP SELLS 80% OF FOREIGN MARKETING ARM 
</P>

<P>
Phoenix Group International Inc. said Thursday that it has sold an 80% interest 
in its foreign marketing arm and certain future foreign commercial rights to a 
British company in an all-stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, Albany Management Group Ltd. of Guernsey, paid for the transaction 
with 1.6 million shares of Phoenix Group stock that it owned. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Group said it will retire those shares, reducing its shares outstanding 
by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Albany's new unit, Phoenix World Trade Ltd., will establish foreign trade and 
counter-trade representation for various subsidiaries of the Phoenix Group, 
particularly in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, said Phoenix Group 
spokesman Jack Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
The deal excludes the recently announced joint venture between American PC -- a 
Phoenix subsidiary -- and the Soviet Union in which American PC is to supply up 
to 6 million personal computers to Soviet schools and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said that Phoenix World Trade will work predominantly to broker 
"counter-trade" items that Phoenix units receive for their goods. 
</P>
<P>
Counter-trade is the practice of paying for purchases with commodities rather 
than currency. An Eastern European government, for example, might pay for 
computers from a Phoenix subsidiary with several thousand tons of coal or 
steel, which Phoenix World Trade would then sell to generate currency. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said Phoenix Group officials have received "a large number" of 
inquiries from potential customers in the Soviet Union since the announcement 
of the computer deal in September and currently is negotiating several other 
transactions that Phoenix World Trade would handle. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Missler, Phoenix Group chairman, and Alan J. Mattal, chairman and chief 
executive of Netcom Research Inc., a Phoenix Group subsidiary, will serve on 
the board of directors of Phoenix World Trade.

GOLDMAN, SACHS PURCHASES SHARES IN CATALINA CORP. 
</P>

<P>
Catalina Marketing Corp., the nation's leading in-store electronic marketer, 
said Thursday that investment banker Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and affiliates 
have purchased 11.5% of the privately held company's outstanding common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs paid an undisclosed cash sum for the shares, which were 
purchased from some of Catalina's original founders and some former managers, 
said Joseph Proctor, Catalina's chief financial officer and vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction makes Goldman Sachs the largest shareholder in Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old firm offers consumer coupon and incentive programs through 
computer systems at grocery store checkout counters. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina developed the "Coupon Solution," a computer process that allows 
supermarket checkers to hand cents-off coupons to customers at the cash 
register. In October, the company began a nine-month test of a "frequent 
shopper" reward system -- akin to trading stamps or frequent-flyer programs -- 
which offers rebates or merchandise to loyal shoppers at selected supermarket 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's revenue totaled $25 million in 1989 -- its first year of 
profitability -- up from $12 million the previous year, Proctor said. The 
company has 150 employees in 13 offices throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of shares to Goldman, Sachs was made because the sellers wanted 
liquidity in their investments, Proctor said. Representatives of Goldman, Sachs 
could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The investment banker's decision to invest in Catalina shows that "the 
financial community recognizes Catalina as a tremendous growth company," said 
Catalina's chief executive, Michael O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
With the sale, the largest shareholders -- in addition to Goldman, Sachs -- are 
O'Brien and Pacific Telecomm Inc., a Northwestern utility company. Proctor 
declined to reveal their respective interests but said the top three have 
almost the same number of shares.

Citing health reasons, soprano Stephanie Friede has withdrawn from three 
upcoming performances in the title role of Verdi's "La Traviata" at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, Opera Pacific announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Friede, who reportedly became ill during rehearsals, will be replaced as 
Violetta by Brenda Harris at performances at 2 p.m. on Sunday and by Nova 
Thomas at 8 p.m. on Jan. 19 and 2 p.m. on Jan. 21, company general director 
David DiChiera said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, an American singer, has sung Violetta with the New York City Opera 
touring company and has also appeared with Ft. Worth Opera and Connecticut 
Grand Opera, among others. Thomas, also a young American soprano, is a native 
of Lilesville, N.C., and was heard as Adalgisa in Opera Pacific's production of 
Bellini's "Norma," with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge last February at 
the Performing Arts Center. CHRIS PASLES

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Hyang Chon, 12921 Fern St., Stanton. (714) 891-5166. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eel, grilled short ribs and barbecued herring are just a few items on this 
Korean restaurant's exotic and varied menu. Pan cha, colorful side dishes, are 
especially good here, with such specialties as gae jang, raw marinated crab, 
and jap chae, glass noodle with meat and vegetable. Lunchtime prices are a 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9314. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular 
during the fifties and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes 
in credible versions of plain old American food-prime rib, pan fried chicken, 
turkey with all the trimmings-all churned out with dependable regularity. The 
menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice of 
Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the tapioca 
pudding you get for free. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner 
Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prie fixe dinners that are 
elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the 
evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like 
appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike 
Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is 
well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and 
lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. Service is performed by smiling waitresses in 
print uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Ghandi, 3820-D Plaza Drive, South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714) 
556-7273. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi could be called new wave Indian: it roasts quail in its clay oven and 
pours Beaujolais nouveau as often as beer. Phlegmatic waiters in fancy tuxedos 
perform service on the brass enclosed patio, a former pizzeria that looks more 
like Paris than Delhi. Appetizers like chicken tikka salad and the various 
tandoori dishes are refined and pleasant. Spicy dishes like lamb in spinach 
puree and curried eggplant are even better. Expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa, 2304 W. Ocean Front, Newport Beach. (714) 675-1930. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Grappa, housed in what used to be Zeppa, is yet another beachfront Italian 
restaurant in Newport. New owner Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed the basic 
concept: The restaurant still resembles a Florentine villa, with a kitchen that 
churns out such favorites as great fried calamari, salads with lots of balsamic 
vinegar, and upscale pastas such as agnolotti and penne. Nodino alla griglia, 
an excellent veal chop grilled with aromatic herbs, is a standout. Desserts are 
intelligently underindulgent. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open daily 
except Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa, 2106 Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except Sundays 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is 
circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes 
alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup. 
Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics 
as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining" 
-- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental 
specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and 
cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos 
flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust. 
</P>
<P>
Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some 
mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional 
food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, mountains of 
flour dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet barbecue that 
kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with 
fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are 
predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
Baci, 18478 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays 
through Sundays from 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some 
cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles 
with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain 
the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. (714) 
750-4321. Open Fridays through Tuesdays from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch times. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there 
can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is 
predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the 
mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is 
extensive and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11, Sundays from 5:30 to 
11 only. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish, 
French, and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. 
Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid 
array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and 
warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting 
main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort 
of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta to have a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni are other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 p.m. to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You will think you've wandered 
into a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking 
of Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most 
beautiful $14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at 
$50 per person, is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill-conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. Curried 
beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, scallops and 
shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
The Towers, in the Surf and Sand Hotel, 155 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. 
(714) 497-4477. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and for dinner from 5:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a task to upstage the commanding sweep of the California coastline at the 
Towers, a Laguna Beach restaurant perched atop a beachfront hotel. New 
executive chef Jackson Kenworth tries his mightiest. He came from Citrus in Los 
Angeles, and he shows his mettle in a variety of dishes. Home-cured salmon is a 
delight, served in bite-size nubs. Sea scallops in a Citrus-like potato risotto 
are sensational. Warm short rib terrine with vegetables in a mustard 
vinaigrette is as original as they come. 
</P>
<P>
Capers, 34150 Coast Highway, Dana Point. (714) 661-3983. Open daily from 11:30 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers is a bright new seafood restaurant occupying the site of the former 
Dana Trader, and it has a beachy, casual air well suited to the location. The 
food isn't half bad when the kitchen plays it straight, but the kitchen tries 
too hard to be creative, often with disastrous results. There is a noble, 
garlicky Caesar, not for wimps, some fair broiled fish and several good shrimp 
dishes. Be wary of the ill-conceived attempts at nouvelle, especially anything 
with the horrid lime dipping sauce, coconut batter -- or capers, the 
restaurant's signature condiment. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Tuesdays through 
Thursdays and Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off. Just remember that the steamed fish 
might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, and 
the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood restaurant, 
but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items such as the Peking 
spareribs or the mouth-watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys such as chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful.

My friend Janet goes through stages where she cancels social plans at the last 
minute. Her excuses vary and are always complex. She talks to my answering 
machine, never to me. 
</P>
<P>
The former local beauty pageant contestant is obsessed with numbers; the ones 
on a scale, her age, her dress size. She buys designer clothes, but they are 
cut bigger so she can boast that she wears a size 4. 
</P>
<P>
Janet, 36, is convinced that an extra 15 pounds separates her from finding love 
and happiness. She has lost those same 15 pounds over and over in the last five 
years, and each time she does she looks gaunt. 
</P>
<P>
Weight is not her only obsession. "Do you think I should have my eyes done?" 
she asked me. 
</P>
<P>
Her "saddlebag thighs" were liposuctioned a year ago, and before that, she had 
her nose straightened. She is about six sutures away from becoming a plastic 
surgery junkie. 
</P>
<P>
"Men expect women to look like they do in Playboy," Janet said. Really? Should 
we all look airbrushed? 
</P>
<P>
My friend Buzz -- who lives in New York -- believes that Californians are 
obsessed with looks. "People here don't have the preoccupation with beauty that 
Californians do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Our conversation caused me to wonder whether people in other parts of the 
country judge looks differently, and that maybe New York -- compared with 
California -- is not such a jungle after all. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Colleen is sure we are obsessed. She has lived all over the United 
States, most recently in Chicago. "I never, ever heard the expression 'hard 
bodies' until I came back to Orange County after 14 years in Chicago," she 
grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"And here, when people talk about hard bodies, you don't know whether they're 
referring to a physique or Ferrari. Both, I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have one, you better have the other, she said with a laugh: "Here, 
if you're five pounds overweight, the fat police issue a warning citation." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it that women feel driven to strive for this kind of superficial 
perfection," said John, a 30-year-old bachelor with looks that compare to Tom 
Selleck's. "People here are skin deep." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach contractor said he has dated women from other parts of the 
country and has noticed some differences: "Women back East are far more 
intellectual and more sincere. You can even discuss politics with them. You 
can't find a woman in Orange County who will talk politics; even the men here 
aren't well versed politically." 
</P>
<P>
He said women from the South and Midwest are more down to earth: "They don't 
shun you if you don't happen to drive the right car or have a body like 
Stallone." 
</P>
<P>
But some, he said, try too hard to be glamorous. "I've noticed that women from 
other parts of the country, especially the South and Midwest, get ideas about 
what they should look like based on watching TV or going to the movies. But 
they always seem to be about a year behind the times." 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who moved here from Missouri 12 years ago, believes that the reason so 
many people are obsessed with physical beauty in California is related to 
climate and the outdoor life-style. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember too," he said, "that Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the 
world; it attracts a lot of young, beautiful and ambitious people." 
</P>
<P>
He suspects that as they age (not always gracefully), the pressure to compete 
in a youth-oriented culture results in insecurity, paranoia -- and more wealth 
for plastic surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
It seems unarguably true that men are judged by different standards than women. 
Take Buzz, for example. He is handsome, sexy, erudite. He is also an 
accomplished writer. He took the big five-oh if not in stride, at least in 
earnest; he began lifting weights and running. 
</P>
<P>
And now Buzz is buff. His grayish hair is beginning to thin? No matter. He's 
still sexy. And those crinkled lines in his face? They serve to heighten his 
smoldering masculinity. Mom was right: Life is not fair. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Connery was recently voted "Sexiest Man Alive" by a People magazine 
reader's poll. He is as bald as a billiard ball, sixty-something, and he 
admitted twice on national TV that if a woman behaves poorly it's not such a 
bad idea to give her a whack now and then. Gee, what a guy. 
</P>
<P>
When was the last time a 60ish woman was voted anything, much less sexy? 
</P>
<P>
John Goodman, Roseanne Barr's hefty TV sidekick, was voted "Sexiest Big Guy" in 
the same poll. Where was the "Sexiest Big Gal" category? The fat jokes are 
reserved for women such as Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Society is not one-sided. Women can be as hypercritical as men when selecting a 
date. Tiffany, a 23-year-old beach beauty, tossed her flaxen mane in that 
special California way and proudly proclaimed: "A guy I date has to take me out 
to nice places, be a sharp dresser and give me a lot of attention. He can't 
smoke, and he has to have great hair." 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope that in 25 years we don't find Tiffany going steady with some guy 
she found lying face down in the gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
But Brenda, a recent Boston transplant, said: "Maybe it's true that single 
people here hold each other up to a higher physical standard; maybe they feel 
entitled. I've traveled all over the world, and everywhere you go people say 
that Southern Californians are the healthiest and most attractive of all. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to come here to be with all the pretty people." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she's right. After all, the Beach Boys did not sing "I wish they all 
could be North Dakotan."

COLD HANDS USUALLY NOT DANGER SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By KAT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are your hands always cold? It's a fairly common but rarely serious condition, 
says Dr. Thomas Shook, a cardiologist who directs the coronary care unit at the 
Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
People with cold hands often have a normal body temperature but lower skin 
temperature, says Shook, who suspects that cold-handed people might simply be 
more sensitive to temperature changes. 
</P>
<P>
Cold hands are not usually a sign of an underlying problem, such as abnormal 
circulation, Shook says. But rarely, cold hands can be a symptom of Raynaud's 
phenomenon, a condition in which the hands turn white, then blue, then red. 
</P>
<P>
"Raynaud's by itself is not serious," Shook says. "But it can be associated 
with more troublesome conditions like scleroderma, a skin disorder, or drug 
allergies." 
</P>
<P>
Short of gloves and hand warmers, there's not much for cold-handed people to 
do, Shook says. Except maybe find solace in the old "cold hands, warm heart" 
theory. By KATHLEEN DOHENY Youngsters in preschool through high school are 
invited to participate in a one-day "mail art" show to be presented March 3 at 
the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. Any subject is acceptable, but all works must 
be two-dimensional and postcard-size (about 4 by 6 inches). Each entry must 
include the artist's name, age and address (the student's name must also be 
printed on the image side of the entry), and all work received will become the 
property of the museum. Mail entries by Feb. 26 to the Bowers Museum Office of 
Education, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana, CA 92706. For further information, call 
(714) 972-1900. Wendy Bargiel, 17, of El Toro has been selected as a regional 
semifinalist in TEEN Magazine's Great Model Search. She was one of 240 
candidates selected from an estimated 24,000 entries. Her photo is appearing in 
the January issue of the magazine. The winner will appear on the cover of the 
October issue. The winner will also receive a $5,000 cash award, a trip for two 
to a resort and a wardrobe of gowns. California State Summer School for the 
Arts is conducting a statewide search to identify the most talented high school 
artists. Those teen-age artists who are selected will attend one of the 
country's premier summer art institutes at Mills College in Oakland. Brochures 
describing the school's visual and performing arts programs, and the 
application process, are currently available through local high schools, 
libraries and arts councils. Those interested should contact their local arts 
councils or the CSSSA at (916) 323-9614. "Talk is cheap because supply exceeds 
demand." -- Unknown

SCUBA TEAM TAKES OVER PE CLASSES TO TEACH TEENS HOW TO DIVE SAFELY FOR FUN AND 
EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER DONLEY, Jennifer Donley is a senior at Orange High School, where 
she is a reporter for the student newspaper, the Reflector, and a member of the 
ski club. She passed the scuba class last year, and plans to attend Rancho 
Santiago College in the fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no basketballs, footballs, baseballs or soccer balls in sight. There 
aren't any softballs, golf balls, tennis balls, volleyballs or water polo 
balls, either. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is a physical education class, but there aren't any games to be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Fun, yes; games, no. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 students in about 40 high schools throughout the Southland each 
year are choosing to learn to scuba dive as part of their PE requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Each participating school is visited once a year by a teaching team from Scuba 
Safety Inc. in La Mirada, which has been providing school-site instruction for 
the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a school of scuba education, not a dive shop," said John Sims, general 
manager of Scuba Safety Inc. "We go to groups of people and provide instruction 
. . . from Thousand Oaks to Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cocktrell, a freshman at Orange High School, recently completed the 
five-week course. "I took the class for the experience of scuba diving and 
being able to use it in the future," she said. The basics of diving are taught 
both in and out of the water, as a day of classroom preparation is usually 
followed by a day of practical experience in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy working with students and teaching them the useful skill of diving," 
said Rick Lebel, one of 20 Scuba Safety instructors. He was recently assisted 
pool-side at Orange High by Tim Holterman, 18, a graduate of Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the basics, students are taught underwater signals, the skills 
needed to figure out depth in the water and safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting to learn how to scuba dive and be able to communicate under 
water," Orange senior Melissa Levers said. 
</P>
<P>
In classes of 25, students practice skills in the shallow end of the pool until 
the instructors believe they are ready to go off the deep end. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was coming up from the deep end of the pool, I thought I was getting 
the bends," said first-time diver Cedric Ward, a junior at Orange. "But I was 
just panicking." 
</P>
<P>
No ocean dives are required to earn PE credit, but if students want to be 
certified, they'll need to take to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to get full certification in scuba diving so I can dive at any time," 
said Sean Demarit, an Orange freshman. 
</P>
<P>
A limited certification requires a student to make two ocean dives with an 
instructor. Full certification -- which means a diver can dive anywhere and at 
any time without an instructor present -- can be gained after five ocean dives 
and six to eight hours of extra training. 
</P>
<P>
Limited certification through Scuba Safety Inc. costs $65 and full 
certification costs $165. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a cool class," Ward said. "I can't wait to get my certification, 
even though it's going to cost me some money." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students say that weekend dives, which are offered at discount 
prices, are the highlight of the class. Students meet early in the morning at 
Corona del Mar State Beach, a south-facing beach with relatively small waves 
and clear water. 
</P>
<P>
There, they dive and then later talk about what they've seen under water. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was diving at Corona del Mar," said Demarit, recalling an unusual 
experience, "a big crab got on the back of my pack, crawled over my back and 
was right up at my mask before I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
But Levers said, "I haven't seen anything really strange, but seeing the other 
people I was diving with, it seemed strange to see them underwater, breathing 
and being able to move." 
</P>

MANY TEENS GET EXERCISE THROUGH SPORTS, PUSH-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been written lately about the physical condition of today's 
teen-agers. The experts often pin the blame on television and video games for a 
generation of out-of-shape kids. 
</P>
<P>
Are teen-agers wasting away their spare time -- as well as their bodies -- in 
the pursuit of nothing? Hot Topics wonders: "What kind of exercise do you get 
on the weekend?" 
</P>
<P>
"I like to go on really long walks with my dog and my Walkman. I also go to the 
gym and lift weights -- I don't know of many girls that do that -- and I go 
dancing at clubs."

Maribel Lopez, 17, senior, Santa Ana Valley 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to my jazz dancing class for a couple of hours. Now, I like to

Racquetball World to work out with my friends."

</P>
<P>
Duane Nguyen, 15, junior, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
"I do everything under the sun since I'm going on a diet. Right now, it's 
getting my dog into the bathtub to get her clean, and strengthening my wrists 
by catching up on all the homework I didn't do during the week." 
</P>
<P>
David Hoenig, 17, senior, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
"There's no time for exercise!" 
</P>

<P>
"I usually go surfing. It is very good exercise for the upper body and legs."

</P>
<P>
"I run up and down the beach looking at surfers."

Collins, Milli Vanilli Battle for Top Spot 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins and Milli Vanilli are playing musical chairs with the top spot on 
the Billboard chart. Collins' " . . . But Seriously" reclaimed No. 1, bouncing 
the Milli Vanilli duo's "Girl You Know It's True" back to second place. But 
Collins shouldn't get too comfortable up there. Milli Vanilli's single "All or 
Nothing" is so hot -- with definite No. 1 potential -- that it's bound to push 
their album back to No. 1. Quincy Jones' "Back on the Block" is shaping up into 
a big hit, climbing five notches to No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
* This album by promising white-soul singer Michael Bolton was off to such a 
slow start over a half-year ago, that it seemed doomed. But his single, "How am 
I Supposed to Live Without You" -- which rose to top of the pop chart this week 
-- salvaged the "Soul Provider" album, which jumped 10 places to No. 22. DENNIS

HOW TO DETERMINE FRAME SIZE 
</P>
<P>
To determine your frame size, extend your arm and bend the forearm up at a 
90-degree angle. Keep fingers straight and turn the inside of your wrist toward 
your body. Place thumb and index finger of your other hand on the two prominent 
bones on each side of your elbow. Measure the space between your fingers 
against a ruler or tape measure. Compare it with the following guide for 
medium-framed men and women. If the measurement is less than that stated here, 
you have a small frame; if it is more, you have a large frame:

<TEXT>
<P>
Interim President Ion Iliescu, bowing to demands of thousands of demonstrators, 
declared today the Communist Party had been abolished in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing an estimated 10,000 protesters from the balcony of the headquarters 
of the ruling National Salvation Front, Iliescu also said the government will 
hold a referendum on Jan. 28 on the issue of reinstating the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
He said the front will also set up a special committee to deal with other 
demands raised by opposition groups since the front replaced Communist executed 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu's unexpected decrees addressed three of the main demands raised by 
thousands of demonstrators during several rallies today in Bucharest. His 
announcement of the abolition of the Communist Party was met with wild cheering 
and chants of the "Communist Party is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand demonstrators massed outside the provisional government 
headquarters in Romania's largest demonstration since the overthrow of 
Ceausescu on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-hour rally that often seemed as confused as it was passionate, the 
crowd shouted slogans for democracy but also chanted "Death for death" in 
calling for the execution of members of Ceausescu's secret police, accused of 
killing thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
At one point the crowd jeered and whistled at Iliescu, who warned that 
Romania's democratic revolution must not be allowed to slip into anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"We must prove that we can stay alive in democratic conditions. If not it's 
going to become a dictatorship again," he said, shouting to be heard above the 
din. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration climaxed a day of rallies and religious services honoring the 
10,000 reported killed in last month's pro-democracy revolution. What started 
as a solemn memorial service for the slain turned into an angry protest against 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds attending the earlier rallies shouted anti-communist slogans and some 
burned Communist Party membership cards. At one ceremony hundreds of people 
marched on the Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest and began banging on 
the doors. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of violence or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The rally at Bucharest's Victory Square, which faces the headquarters of the 
ruling National Salvation Front, began in the mid-afternoon and swelled to 
include about 10,000 people by 7 p.m. The demonstrators listened to dozens of 
speakers who led them chant after chant, including "Down with communism," "We 
are the people," "Freedom," and "Death for death." 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu and other government officials who addressed the crowd were only able 
usually to say a few lines at a time before their voices were lost in the 
chanting. 
</P>
<P>
At times other people who climbed on the tank used as a speaker's platform 
would snatch the microphone away to demand explanations for the officials' 
former links to the Communist Party.

LITHUANIANS COOL TO VOW OF PLEBISCITE ON SECESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised a national vote on the republics' right 
to secede, but Lithuanian leaders today rejected it as a "trap" and said 
Gorbachev has underestimated their republic's desire for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, meanwhile, traveled to the Lithuanian countryside in an effort to 
stop Lithuania's independence campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The president, his voice cracking with emotion at times, predicted on Thursday 
night that Lithuanians will choose to stay in the Soviet Union once they 
realize the difficulty of secession and the hardships it would place on ethnic 
groups in their republic. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, people don't know what awaits them," he said. "They've been told fairy 
tales, Russian fairy tales and Lithuanian fairy tales." 
</P>
<P>
His comments were broadcast today on Lithuanian television. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin leader is in the middle of what so far has been a futile campaign 
to stop the secession movement, probably the worst political crisis Gorbachev 
has faced in his nearly five years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev noted that the Soviet Constitution guarantees each of the country's 
15 republics the right to secede and disclosed that the first draft of a law 
detailing the process of secession has been written. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of Lithuania's pro-independence Sajudis movement, Vytautas 
Landsbergis, today said of the announcement, "It's a propaganda trap." 
</P>
<P>
"If we get entangled in the mechanism of seceding from the Soviet Union, we 
automatically act as if we were a legal part of the Soviet Union." His group 
maintains that Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 was 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev promised a national discussion and referendum on the law, which would 
require republics to hold their own plebiscite on breaking away. 
</P>
<P>
"I favor the existence of a mechanism (to secede) to stop this speculation. . . 
. Let there be a choice by the people," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience broke into applause and broad smiles. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no clear details about the draft law but implied it would require a 
republic considering secession to make detailed plans, set out the exact costs, 
both financial and in terms of human dislocation, and then hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Lithuanians will reject secession in favor of a loose Soviet 
federation, saying they will never feel free if their lives improve at the 
expense of ethnic Russians, Poles and other non-Lithuanians who live in the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
When the audience objected, Gorbachev's voice rose. "It will never happen," he 
nearly shouted. "You are a civilized people. Your conscience won't let you."

$1-BILLION DISNEY PARK; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH, ANAHEIM IN CONTENTION

<P>
The Walt Disney Co. today announced that a $1-billion theme park will be built 
in Southern California and unveiled plans for about a dozen new attractions at 
Disneyland that will give the venerable park more of a Hollywood flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The new park will be built either next to Disneyland in Anaheim or near the 
Queen Mary-Spruce Goose attraction -- bought by Disney from the Wrather Corp. 
in 1988 -- in Long Beach, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends a lot on which community wants us more," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney will go to the city that demonstrates the best plan for handling the 
traffic and parking needed for the massive project, Eisner said. He declined to 
release details of the park, saying its theme, size and opening date will 
depend on where it is built. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Disney owns about 66 acres around Disneyland. In Long Beach, the 
company leases 55 acres and holds the option to develop 256 acres of water 
surrounding the Queen Mary attraction. Previously, Disney officials had 
mentioned the idea of a water theme park for this site. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a new park is likely to set off a bidding war between 
Anaheim and Long Beach, two cities that already compete for lucrative 
convention business. Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter was first to the punch today as 
he presented Eisner with a proclamation honoring Disneyland's 35th anniversary 
being celebrated this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I have the first opportunity before Long Beach to say the answer is yes, 
yes, yes," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, some Long Beach officials were given a presentation about the 
possibility of a theme park. Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, 
who represents the downtown area and the Queen Mary site, said Long Beach 
offers a superior infrastructure and transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go as far as we have to go as long as it makes economic sense" to get 
the theme park, Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner also announced plans for a "Disney Decade" that will include the most 
ambitious expansion in Disneyland's history. The expansions will tie the 
Disney's increasingly successful movie operations to the theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, a Dick Tracy stage show at Disneyland will open, timed to 
accompany the release of the company's Dick Tracy movie. In 1991, the Muppets 
will have their own attraction and daily parade and a "Young Indiana Jones" 
stunt show will also open.

Later in the 1990s, two new "lands" will be built: Mickey's Starland, which 
will include the Muppets and an attraction based on the animated film "The 
Little Mermaid," and "Hollywoodland," a reconstruction of Hollywood Boulevard 
as it looked in the 1930s and 1940s, plus two new Roger Rabbit attractions. 
Disneyland's "Tomorrowland" area will also be entirely remodeled.

A federal magistrate set $1-million bond for a co-defendant of deposed 
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega today and attorneys huddled for discussions 
about Noriega's detention in the courthouse basement. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo set the $1 million bail for Daniel Miranda, who 
is charged with flying from Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Lauderdale to Panama with $800,000 in laundered drug money. But prosecutors 
appealed the bail, meaning that Miranda, 36, could not immediately be released. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane was late to court because he was attacked 
near his home by a masked man with a foot-long crowbar. Police have a suspected 
assailant under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kane, his head bandaged but still bleeding when he arrived in court, said his 
attacker offered to tell who sent him only if assault charges were dropped, but 
the attorney said he does not plan to drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kane's report of the attack prompted federal marshals to increase security 
for Palermo.

A fire in a North Hollywood commercial building this morning caused an 
estimated $6 million in property losses, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. 
There were no injuries and the cause of the fire was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 4:14 a.m. in the single-story complex in the 7400 
block of Fulton Avenue, spokesman Greg Acevedo said. About 130 firefighters 
controlled the blaze in about an hour. The 45,000-square-foot building was 
severely damaged and flames burned through the roof, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials estimated damage to the building at more than $4 million; the 
loss of contents was estimated at $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
The building had once been an air-conditioning warehouse and was used by 
several small businesses, including a flag manufacturer, a novelty company, a 
trophy and plaque maker and a video production company. 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo said several employees were working at the production company when the 
fire was reported. They escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
Because of heavy damage to the building, investigators had not yet pinpointed 
where the fire started, Acevedo said.

E. GERMAN DROPS SECRET POLICE PLAN

<P>
East Germany's Communist premier today bowed to opposition demands and dropped 
a plan to form a new secret police force before the nation's first multiparty 
elections in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Through May 6, no offices will be created in this area," Premier Hans Modrow 
said, referring to election day and the controversial plan. Members of East 
Germany's 500-member Parliament responded with a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
As Parliament met to discuss the country's woes, more than 200 East Berlin taxi 
drivers drove in a line to the Parliament building, honking their horns to show 
their displeasure with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for a new national security agency, including a secret police force, had 
drawn bitter opposition from members of Modrow's coalition government as well 
as from the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The reformist Communist government last month abolished the hated Stasi secret 
police, but Modrow had said some kind of internal security force is needed to 
guard against alleged dangers from neo-Nazis and others. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said decisions on the sensitive issues of internal security 
should wait until a democratically elected government takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow still faces further challenges to his leadership before the elections, 
including demands of proof that the old secret police apparatus has been fully 
dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the non-Communist partners in the coalition government 
oppose election rules drawn up by the Communists, which they say could hurt the 
non-Communists' chances of winning in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"If the law is passed in its present form, our party may not be able to stay in 
the government," Christian Democratic Chairman Lothar de Maiziere said in an 
interview today with the West Berlin radio station RIAS. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats, another coalition partner, also oppose the draft 
election law. 
</P>
<P>
Objections focus on a provision of the law that would ban campaign aid from 
outside the country. The provision is aimed at West Germans already gearing up 
to help the opposition and non-Communist parties. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday evening, 3,000 pro-democracy supporters staged a noisy protest outside 
Parliament. "Down with the Communists!" and "Out with the Stasi!" they chanted. 
Stasi, a shortened form of Staatssicherheit, or "state security," is the 
popular name for the secret police force.

President Hosni Mubarak today fired the head of the nation's police forces 
after the ironfisted and outspoken minister was quoted as saying Muslim 
extremists should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Zaki Badr, known for his harsh and sustained crackdowns on 
the extremists, lost his job less than a month after surviving an apparent 
bombing assassination attempt blamed on members of the extremist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Badr's sharp tongue and harsh security operations had drawn criticism from the 
militants and from the nation's opposition political parties. 
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb went off in suburban Cairo on Dec. 16, seconds before Badr's 
motorcade arrived at his sports club. A medical student from Assiut University 
was arrested at the site, and about 300 people were rounded up later. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 500 had been detained in Assiut the week before the explosion after a 
provincewide security sweep typical of Badr's methods. 
</P>
<P>
At one point last year, 6,000 alleged Muslim militants were held in prison 
after being arrested during raids on areas considered militant strongholds. 
Many militant leaders used their publications to attack him. 
</P>
<P>
Before today, Mubarak had ignored such criticism and retained Badr, a 
practicing Muslim who was named to the post in 1986.

A federal judge fined Par Pharmaceutical Inc. and its Quad Pharmaceuticals unit 
a total of $400,000 today for their role in a Food and Drug Administration 
payoff scandal involving generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Par was fined $150,000 and Quad $250,000 in a proceeding before U.S. District 
Judge John Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
Par and Quad faced maximum fines of $500,000 each after agreeing to plead 
guilty to criminal charges stemming from a nearly two-year government probe of 
the generic drug industry and its regulation by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
In July, federal prosecutors had charged that Par and Quad executives gave cash 
payoffs to an FDA chemist when the chemist was reviewing the companies' drug 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Par, based in Spring Valley, N.Y., remains the focus of a separate criminal 
investigation being pursued by the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigations 
subcommittee disclosed in September that Par was under Justice Department 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee staff said in a memo that Par's drug development process was 
found to be "rife with problems such as material false statements, systematic 
destruction of unfavorable test results . . . and material alterations in 
chemical formulations between . . . tested and marketed products."

T. Boone Pickens is carrying his Japanese corporate battle to court with a 
lawsuit to gain access to the financial books of Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd., 
the auto parts maker of which he is the largest shareholder, Pickens' lawyer 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens filed the lawsuit in Tokyo District Court, his lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that Pickens will win. But it is all up to the judges," 
Ishizumi said. 
</P>
<P>
Koito has not agreed to Pickens' request for the right to look over its account 
books covering the years from April 1, 1979, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koito told Pickens to wait until Jan. 22 for a response, Ishizumi said. "But 
there is no reason why we have to wait that long," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens holds a 26% stake in Koito through his private investment firm Boone 
Co. Toyota Motor Corp. holds 19% of Koito's shares, buys the bulk of its 
output, and has three seats on its board. Pickens has been denied any seats.

1989 RETAIL SALES UP 5%, SMALLEST GAIN IN 7 YEARS

<P>
Retail sales, reflecting a sluggish economy, rose just 5% in 1989, the smallest 
gain in seven years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales for all of 1989 totaled $1.71 trillion, down 
from 1988's 7.1% gain. It was the smallest advance since a 2.9% increase in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The economy was pinched through much of last year by high interest rates caused 
by the Federal Reserve's tight credit policies designed to contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and 
thus are one barometer of the extent to which the Fed's anti-inflation policies 
have slowed the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2% in December to a seasonally 
adjusted $144.4 billion after rising 0.5% in November. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the November increase was attributed by analysts to the early start of 
Christmas shopping during the weekend after Thanksgiving and raised 
expectations of many merchants and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
But the December sales turned out to be modest, and the Department of Commerce 
said spending during the November-December period rose only 3.8% over the same 
period in 1988, when sales were up 6.6% over the previous two-month period. It 
was the lowest November-December gain since sales rose 2.9% in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Half or more of retail profits come from business done between Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items such as cars and household 
appliances expected to last more than three years -- fell 0.6% after edging up 
0.1% in November. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods, which often are financed by loans and thus are susceptible to 
interest rates, have been hit hardest by Fed policies. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, which have been in the doldrums, fell 0.7% in December after a 0.4% 
decline in November. Auto sales finished the year up just 2.2% contrasted with 
a 10.3% gain in 1988. It was the lowest since sales declined 8.1% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding autos, overall sales in December were up 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Among other durable sales, building materials rose 0.1% on top of a 0.7% rise 
in November, while furniture and other home furnishings declined 1% after a 
0.7% increase a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.6% after gaining 0.8% in November. 
</P>
<P>
Gains were posted in grocery stores, up 0.6%, and gasoline stations, up 1.3%, 
due in part to higher prices. Apparel sales advanced 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Declines were posted in department store sales, down 0.4%; restaurants and 
bars, down 0.9%, and drug stores, down 1%. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months from October through December, overall retail sales were 
up 3.6%.

today by Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, at the network's 
semi-annual press gathering in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roundtree will star as Daniel Reubens, a doctor forced to live in hiding for

make his first on-air appearance Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Roundtree starred as John Shaft in a trio of movies about the private eye: 
"Shaft," "Shaft's Big Score" and "Shaft In Africa." He also starred in a 
90-minute television version, "Shaft." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff said the addition of Roundtree is "further indication of our 
commitment to and confidence" in "Generations," which debuted last year.

'ROSEANNE' GETS A PEACEMAKER

A producer who specializes in handling hot-blooded talent has been brought in 
to smooth relations between Roseanne Barr and the producers of her top-ranked 
ABC-TV comedy series, "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Daniel, a former producer at ABC's "Moonlighting," joined "Roseanne" with 
the title of executive producer for Carsey-Werner Productions, David Brokaw, a 
spokesman for the company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Barr reportedly has wanted her character to express more anger than the 
producers and writers would agree to. She had the show's creator and original 
executive producer, Matt Williams, fired, and recently asked to get rid of his 
successor, Jeff Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to make Roseanne happier," said Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner. 
"Roseanne feels she needs another person to listen to her. So whatever we can 
do to make her happy we'll do. The shows are wonderful, so whatever Roseanne 
has to go through to get there, in the end, results in great television." 
</P>
<P>
At "Moonlighting," Daniel was credited with settling problems between the 
production company and Cybill Shepherd, who starred in the show with Bruce 
Willis.

'ROGER &amp; ME' DEBUTS IN DETROIT

"Roger &amp; Me," the controversial film about how layoffs by General Motors 
Corp. decimated Flint, Mich., made its Detroit premiere before a capacity crowd 
Thursday night in the shadow of GM's world headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Moore, the 35-year-old former editor of Mother Jones magazine who 
wrote, directed and starred in the film, said the movie "will be GM's worst 
nightmare come true" if it succeeds at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Shown to a sold-out audience of 1,150 at the Detroit Institute of Arts, "Roger 
&amp; Me" is a dark comedy that loosely chronicles how the city of Flint tried 
to cope with its economic woes after a series of massive layoffs at GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
The "Roger" of the title is GM Chairman Roger B. Smith, who in one scene is 
shown quoting Charles Dickens at a GM Christmas party juxtaposed with 
gut-wrenching scenes of a Flint family being evicted on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, also former editor of the Flint Voice alternative newspaper, is seen 
dogging Smith in a tongue-in-cheek effort to ask the GM chief to tour Flint and 
view the devastation caused by the layoffs of 32,000 workers during the last 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Both GM and Smith have refrained from making public comment about the movie, 
although they have privately called Moore "a social radical." 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the profits from the film will be put toward a nonprofit company 
to encourage other novice filmmakers with relevant stories to tell.

CURTIN IN, ALDA OUT AS NBC PLOTS FALL STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Alda won't be on NBC next fall in a regular series as planned. But Jane 
Curtin, who wasn't expected to return to series television, will. So will a 
new, big-budget, prime-time version of "Dark Shadows," the Gothic serial. 
</P>
<P>
These were some of the announcements made Thursday by Brandon Tartikoff, 
president of NBC Entertainment, in a press conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also announced that NBC will counter-program baseball's league 
playoffs and World Series next fall with four to six hours of made-for-TV movie 
versions of Jackie Collins and Danielle Steel books, to which the network 
recently obtained rights. 
</P>
<P>
NBC lost the rights last year to major league baseball in a bidding war with 
CBS. Tartikoff said this is NBC's answer. "We're not taking it lying down. . . 
. No one's ever seriously counter-programmed the World Series, but we are." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would watch movies based on Collins' books, "Lucky" and 
"Chances," or watch the World Series, Tartikoff said, "I have a VCR." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also announced that "Fall From Grace," a made-for-TV movie based 
about Jim and Tammy Bakker's television ministry, is going into production. And 
two miniseries -- one about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the other based on 
the "The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All" best-seller -- will be 
filmed for next season on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff explained the loss of a regular series starring Alan Alda next fall 
as being the result of a decision by Alda not to return to weekly television. 
The plan for the series was Alda starring as a middle-aged man facing mid-life 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Alda had completed one script, which Tartikoff said NBC will own and might 
produce with another star in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened for Alan, though," Tartikoff said, "is that his directing 
career is in high gear. Disney has a major motion picture they want him to get 
involved in. And nobody knows the demands of weekly series television better 
than Alan." 
</P>
<P>
He announced no details of the comedy planned for Curtin but said that "Dark 
Shadows" -- which is still a cult series after a daytime run years ago -- will 
premiere as a two-hour movie featuring some members of the original cast next 
fall. Dan ("War and Remembrance") Curtis, creator of the original series, will 
be executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments at NBC, "The Ann Jillian Show" has been pulled from the 
schedule and is going in for a major overhaul with new producers. "My Two Dads" 
will return Sunday evenings starting Jan. 21.

Spotting Miss America during her Missouri Capitol homecoming was easy -- just 
look for her official escort. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen state troopers, deputy sheriffs and Capitol Complex police, many in 
dress uniforms, walked Debbye Turner through visits with the governor, both 
chambers of the Legislature, and individual officeholders Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, an Arkansas native who is the first Missouri resident to wear the Miss 
America crown, also addressed the House and Senate after talking to 400 
children in the Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
Turner explained how others told her she could never be Miss America because 
she is black and too short and because her talent -- marimba playing -- was too 
oddball for pageants. 
</P>
<P>
"If this marimba-playing, 5-foot-7 minority can be be Miss America, then you 
can do anything," she said.

Lucille Ball "was not funny off stage" and Desi Arnaz "ended up a drunk," but 
daughter Lucie Arnaz said she doesn't resent her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Her mom was "a control freak," Arnaz said on "The Joan Rivers Show" taped 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The show will be telecast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to be in charge 24 hours a day," Arnaz said. "She loved us in her own 
way. I'm sure she loved us in the only way she knew how." 
</P>
<P>
Desi used to say that Lucille was "so funny," but, according to his daughter, 
Desi was "a lot funnier" than Lucille. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, as far as doing the physical stuff, she (Lucy) was the queen. But . . 
. I get my humor from my dad, not from her -- which is odd, but I do. He's a 
naturally funny kind of guy. And he always used to see things funny, so that's 
kind of depressing that he ended up a drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Arnaz said her father "never got the acclaim that I think he deserved, because 
he was the brains behind all that comedy talent."

<P>
Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker, preparing for next week's Australian Open, were 
beaten today in the quarterfinals of the New South Wales Open. 
</P>
<P>
West German Carl-Uwe Steeb downed Becker, his Davis Cup teammate, 7-6 (7-3), 
6-3, and Yannick Noah played brilliantly to frustrate Lendl and cruise to a 
6-1, 6-4 win. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl and Becker, the world's top-ranked players, were using the tournament to 
fine-tune their games for the Australian Open, which begins Monday in 
Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Steeb, who four weeks ago teamed up with Becker to give West Germany a second 
straight Davis Cup title, beat his compatriot with clinical precision, while 
Noah overpowered Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Noah now faces defending champion Aaron Krickstein of the United States, a 6-1, 
7-6 (7-3) winner over American qualifier David Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
Steeb, ranked 16th in the world, will play fifth-seeded Mats Wilander of 
Sweden, who downed American Pete Sampras 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 6-0 in his 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's quarterfinals, Austrians Barbara Paulus and Judith Wiesner, 
American teen-ager Amy Frazier and Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
In Adelaide, Australia, meanwhile, John McEnroe struggled for nearly two hours 
Friday night before beating fellow American Jim Courier and advancing to the 
final of the Rio Challenge exhibition tennis tournament at Memorial Drive. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe won 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 to finish on top of the blue group in the round-robin 
event with a 2-0 record. Frenchman Henri Leconte was 1-1, and Courier was 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander next plays Sweden's Stefan Edberg, ranked third in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Masters champion Edberg was given a tough match by Austrian Thomas Muster 
before winning 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (5-7), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In Auckland, New Zealand, defending champion Ramesh Krishnan of India upset 
third-seeded Swede Magnus Gustafsson 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 today and advanced to the 
semifinals of the New Zealand Open tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan earned a meeting Saturday with eighth-seeded American Scott Davis, a 
6-2, 7-6 (7-0) winner over New Zealand veteran Steven Guy. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to the semifinals were top seed Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet 
Union and 1988 champion Amos Mansdorf of Israel. Chesnokov ousted Canadian 
Grant Connell 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, while Mansdorf beat American Jimmy Arias 6-3, 7-6 
(7-3).

The company that supplies equipment and services for the Sports Action betting 
game has joined the state of Oregon in asking that the NBA's lawsuit against 
the Oregon Lottery be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Gtech Corp. of Providence, R.I., one of the defendants in the lawsuit, filed 
the motion Thursday in U.S. District Court in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon attorney general's office filed a motion for dismissal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA lawsuit says the Sports Action game, the nation's only lottery game 
based on pro sports, violates state and federal law because it is not a game of 
chance. The game allows people to wager $1 or more on three to 14 professional 
football or basketball games against point spreads set by a Las Vegas odds 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA is expected to file its response within 10 days.

Raiders owner Al Davis met today with city and county officials to see if they 
could agree on a $528-million proposal to bring the NFL team back to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited about the prospects. We've been working for 12 months to get 
to this day," said Don Perata, chairman of the Alameda County Board of 
Supervisors. "This meeting is pivotal. . . . This is a good contract that can 
only benefit the community and the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the Oakland Coliseum was the first time Davis, who moved the 
team in 1982, has sat down with local officials to discuss the proposed deal. 
Negotiations with the team began a year ago, and representatives of both sides 
finished working out details during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento also is wooing the Raiders, and Los Angeles is trying to keep the 
team, which has a 10-year lease to play in the city. Davis, talking briefly 
with reporters as he went into the meeting, was noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no commitments," he said. "I'm going to this meeting to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, however, also said he felt positive about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I have positive feelings, or I wouldn't be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement was not expected after today's meeting, and any accord would 
require the approval of the Oakland City Council, county supervisors and the 
board of the Coliseum, which is owned by the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said he was optimistic that the Raiders would 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best place to bring the Raiders. I think Los Angeles is looking 
for an expansion team, and Sacramento isn't established to handle the team," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal being offered to Davis includes an unconditional 15-year lease and 
would pay the Raiders a $54.9-million franchise fee and at least $3.7 million a 
year from the lease of executive seats, guaranteed sellouts of general 
admission seats and $3.6 million from club seats.
