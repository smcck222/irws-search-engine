GAO CITES FRAUD IN FAILURES OF S&amp;LS; 
</P>

OFFICIAL CALLS MISCONDUCT RAMPANT IN TROUBLED FIRMS EXAMINED BY AGENCY

<P>
A massive wave of fraud and other criminal behavior may have played a much 
bigger role in the financial collapse of hundreds of savings and loan 
associations than has previously been disclosed, the General Accounting Office 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an intensive investigation of a group of failed S&amp;Ls, including some of 
the largest of them, the GAO found that fraud or insider abuse existed in every 
case, GAO official Frederick D. Wolf said during a hearing here of the House 
Banking Committee at which he previewed a GAO report that will be issued soon. 
</P>
<P>
The report implies that the massive wave of collapses in the U.S. savings and 
loan industry will be viewed ultimately as the biggest white-collar crime in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Previously, federal regulators had insisted that, although fraud was a problem, 
it was only a minor issue compared with the collapse of oil prices and real 
estate values in Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall told Congress earlier this 
week that fraud apparently was involved in just 20% or 25% of thrift failures. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolf said Friday that illegal behavior was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraud or insider abuse existed at each and every one of the failed thrifts 
(surveyed)," said Wolf, who is director of the accounting and financial 
management division of the GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities combined with the impact of an economic slump to drive 
S&amp;Ls into financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Honestly run S&amp;Ls, by contrast, weathered the economic slump. As the report 
puts it: "On the other hand, many thrifts which operated prudently survived the 
same adverse conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The pervasiveness of corruption was uncovered in the GAO's review of 26 
institutions from among the 284 failed or failing S&amp;Ls that were merged, 
liquidated or helped by federal regulators between the beginning of 1985 and 
Sept. 30, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The companies in the sample accounted for $11.4 billion in losses to the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. fund, or 57% of the losses suffered by 
the fund in connection with all 284 cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 companies were not identified, Wolf said, because disclosure could 
jeopardize "the government's efforts to seek recoveries in civil suits or to 
prosecute alleged criminal acts." 
</P>
<P>
The frauds included a wide variety of abuses. For example, the owner of one 
thrift used $2 million of the S&amp;L's funds to buy himself a beach house and 
spent an additional $500,000 on furnishings and maintenance while he lived 
there. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L owners often would arrange for loans to friends and business associates 
based on hugely inflated and false appraisals of real estate properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phony Land Sales 
</P>
<P>
Parcels of land would be swapped and sold among S&amp;Ls at ever-higher 
appraisals. A piece of land might be sold from one dummy company to another, 
getting a higher appraisal each time. When the ostensible value was swollen to 
millions of dollars, a loan would be arranged. There are many pieces of land in 
Texas and other properties whose true value is a tiny fraction of the money 
that was lent on these properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some borrowers received large amounts of money under false pretenses. One 
received $2 million to buy land for a ski resort but used only $200,000 to buy 
the land and directed the rest of the money to personal uses. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents and other investigators expect to continue their probes into the 
extent of the frauds in the Southwest for years. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf told the hearing also that the federal bailouts of insolvent thrifts last 
year may only worsen the crisis. He said the sales to private investors could 
cost the taxpayers more than if the government had simply closed the 
institutions and paid off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board provided more than $37 billion in federal notes and tax breaks 
to private investors who agreed to take over insolvent thrifts in 1988. But 
Wolf said the actual cost of the deals may be closer to $50 billion by the time 
all the notes are paid off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Prolong Problem 
</P>
<P>
"We also have serious reservations about whether these assistance actions will 
result in permanent solutions or simply prolong the problem and increase its 
ultimate cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, James Cirona, president of the San Francisco Home Loan Bank, 
told the committee that the FBI and the Justice Department need more money to 
pursue white-collar criminals in the savings and loan business. 
</P>
<P>
"Judges must take these crimes more seriously and sentence convicted felons to 
substantial prison terms," Cirona said. "Some sentences in this district have 
been scandalously weak. We must deter future looting of thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) asked witness Larry Taggart, who served as 
California savings and loan commissioner during a period of major savings and 
loan growth in 1983 and 1984: "How did all these crooks get into the S&amp;L 
industry in the state?" 
</P>
<P>
Taggart responded: "I'd have to have your definition of a crook." Taggart said 
many of the industry's problems could have been managed if federal regulators 
had not acted too quickly in closing down troubled institutions. "There was a 
tremendous amount of seizure mania," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry observers say just the opposite -- that many thrifts were allowed 
to remain alive long after it was clear that they would never return to 
profitability. The losses such companies continued to accumulate, these critics 
say, greatly intensified the crisis in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to Regan Cited 
</P>
<P>
The committee distributed a letter that Taggart wrote in 1986, when he was a 
private consultant, appealing to White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan for 
help against federal S&amp;L regulators. The bank board's actions "are likely 
to have a very adverse impact on the ability of our party to raise needed 
campaign funds in the upcoming elections," Taggart's letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said he sent the letter because federal regulators were acting unfairly 
toward the industry, especially in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Banking Committee members were sharply critical of Taggart and had 
particularly strong praise for Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, who undertook a stepped-up enforcement campaign during 
his 1983-87 term. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Taggart, Gray told the committee: "It seems as if he was 
running a little club out there (in California). I get the impression he saw 
the people he was regulating as people he would do business with after 
leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Gray spoke at length of his frustrations in trying to get more money to hire 
additional examiners and to increase regulation despite the opposition of the 
S&amp;L industry and of Reagan Administration budget officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had 'Ragtag Band' 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little ragtag band of examiners. We were being denied the kind of 
help we needed," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norman D. Shumway (R-Stockton) said: "I can corroborate Ed Gray's message 
during the time of his tenure." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing laughter from the audience, Rep. Lehman said to Gray, "You are damn 
near always right. You deserve all the credit you've given yourself this 
morning."

RESCUE OF 6 IN ARMENIA MAY BE HOAX 
</P>

<P>
With the nation still aglow over the news of six men being rescued after more 
than a month beneath the rubble of the Armenian earthquake, the Soviet press 
raised the possibility Friday that the rescue story is a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded face of electrician Aikaz Akopyan had become a familiar sight on 
television after widespread publicity given to the account of his rescue from 
beneath the wreckage of a building in Leninakan. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, had quoted Akopyan, now hospitalized in 
Yerevan, as saying he had been trapped in the building's basement for 35 days, 
along with five neighbors, surviving on canned vegetables, pickles and a smoked 
ham. 
</P>
<P>
Akopyan was said to have massaged another man's broken arm with the healing 
power of a specialist in folk medicine. He reportedly sang songs to keep up his 
neighbors' spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Akopyan reportedly stuck to his story when he was interviewed again Friday. 
Doctors said that he was suffering from pneumonia and stress but appeared to be 
lucid. 
</P>
<P>
But reporters for the government newspaper Izvestia said they now have deep 
suspicions about the story. They are not yet calling Akopyan a liar, but they 
have raised strong doubts about his story. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Friday, "Regrettably we are unable to confirm with full certainty the 
authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian colleagues about the 
'Leninakan miracle,' nor can we categorically deny them." 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said that Akopyan is indeed in a clinic in Yerevan -- he was 
interviewed there for Thursday night's national TV news program -- but that 
efforts to trace the other five survivors have proved unavailing. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that officials in Leninakan can find no evidence of a rescue 
having taken place Wednesday, when Akopyan was said to have been pulled from 
the rubble of the nine-story building. Moreover, the woman who took Akopyan to 
the hospital in Yerevan has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy chief of the Yerevan hospital said he was "greatly surprised" at the 
woman's failure to appear. She identified herself as Akopyan's sister, and the 
hospital official said that relatives of other people injured in the earthquake 
had stayed by the side of their relatives for days. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a hoax came to light when the Izvestia reporters happened, 
shortly after the rescue was announced, to be on the street in Leninakan where 
Akopyan said he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said no one in the neighborhood was aware that anyone had been pulled 
from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to believe that such an event could pass totally unnoticed by people 
who live in the area," an official of the local rescue effort said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures, nearly 25,000 people were killed in the Dec. 7 
earthquake. Leninakan was one of the worst-hit towns. The search for survivors 
was called off two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
A Health Ministry official told Izvestia that no trace could be found of the 
other five alleged survivors and that clinics in the area reported that they 
had no new patients on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Tunan, head of the Health and Social Security Department of the Armenian 
Council of Ministers, confirmed that he had alerted reporters to the rescue 
story after being told about it by bystanders in front of a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Tunan said that Akopyan, when asked why he did not know his rescuers, replied 
that they had blindfolded him, presumably to protect his eyes from sunlight 
after so many days in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said that when its reporters visited Akopyan in the hospital he was 
being interviewed by a psychiatrist. The unidentified psychiatrist, while 
noting that Akopyan had tied his head in a sash to protect himself "against 
falling objects in his bed," had recognized a Leninakan neighbor in the room 
and was believed to be sane. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, not all the doctors we talked to shared this professional 
opinion," Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
On television, Akopyan appeared to be dazed. He talked with apparent 
difficulty. When he was first asked what he remembered of the rescue, he 
replied, "I remember nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia noted that many earlier reports of unusual rescues have been 
disproved. 
</P>
<P>
A Tass correspondent, Kirill Dibrova, wrote, "One wants to believe that this 
nearly incredible story will eventually turn out to be true."

ALLEGED WIRETAP SCHEME INVESTIGATED IN CINCINNATI

Bob Draise never cared much for black militants and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
So, he says now, when a Cincinnati police sergeant asked him in 1972 to wiretap 
the local Black Muslim headquarters, and later the homes of people the police 
said were criminals, Draise, a telephone installer for Cincinnati Bell, readily 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
He even gave the police the name of a co-worker he said would help. Soon, 
however, the two phone workers claim, they were tapping the lines of 
congressmen, federal judges, defense contractors, city officials, businessmen, 
news reporters, lawyers and even top local FBI and police officials -- all at 
the direction of either the police intelligence unit or their Cincinnati Bell 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a federal grand jury is investigating charges of illegal wiretapping by 
the police and the telephone company. In testimony before it, Draise and 
Leonard Gates, the other Bell employee, claim to have tapped more than 1,300 
phones from 1972 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, they did President Ford when he came to town," Draise said in an 
interview. "The movers and shakers of this town have been wiretapped, the 
people who control the money in this town." 
</P>
<P>
According to allegations made before the grand jury and in a separate 
$112-million class-action lawsuit filed against Cincinnati Bell and the Police 
Department, employees of the telephone company, in addition to doing the Police 
Department's bidding, also sold commercially sensitive information obtained by 
wiretaps to "preferred Bell customers." 
</P>
<P>
The spying operation headed by the police allegedly involved other illegal 
acts, including burglaries and arson. 
</P>
<P>
Five police officers, including a former police chief, have taken the Fifth 
Amendment before the grand jury rather than answer questions about their roles 
in the wiretapping scheme. Spokesmen for Cincinnati Bell flatly deny that the 
allegations are true. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Draise and Mr. Gates are lying when they say that Cincinnati Bell forced 
or authorized them to do any illegal wiretaps," company spokeswoman Cyndi 
Cantoni said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Bid for Revenge 
</P>
<P>
She contends that the two men are making the allegations as retribution against 
the company for firing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Draise was fired because he got caught doing wiretapping and Mr. Gates was 
fired because he was a bad manager," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Draise was convicted in 1979 in federal court of wiretapping a telephone for a 
friend. He was forced to resign. Gates was fired in 1986. He alleges that he 
was fired partly because he refused to place any more illegal wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men's allegations have been corroborated before the grand jury by 
others with knowledge of the wiretapping operation, including a police sergeant 
and the former chief of security at the hotel where then-President Gerald R. 
Ford stayed when he visited Cincinnati in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Lucas, the former Stouffer's Hotel security chief, said in an interview 
that he was approached by a police sergeant for access to the hotel's telephone 
switching room a month before Ford's visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recognized as Officers 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who refused the request, said the police sergeant had come to the hotel 
with five men, several of whom he recognized as police officers, and a Bell 
workmen whom he has since learned was Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Lucas refused the police request, he said he found wiretapping 
equipment and a voice-activated tape recorder hidden in the telephone switching 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the telephone company nor the Police Department acknowledged that it 
owned the equipment, so he destroyed it, Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw some of the men at the hotel on two other occasions before 
Ford's visit, but that he never found any more wiretapping equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has said, however, that he succeeded in tapping Ford's room, despite 
Lucas' resistance. Gates said he was told that the wiretapping was being done 
at the behest of the FBI for security purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Other wiretap targets allegedly included Procter &amp; Gamble and Wren Business 
Communications Systems, a rival of Cincinnati Bell. Draise told investigators 
that Bell employees routinely monitored customer calls to Wren. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Felt They Had a Ghost' 
</P>
<P>
"I was not surprised by the allegations," said David Stoner, president of Wren 
Communications. "It made sense because of things that had occurred that were 
improbable statistically. . . . Our marketing people felt they had a ghost 
continually. 
</P>
<P>
"Repeatedly, we would talk to people who were dissatisfied with Cincinnati 
Bell. For the sake of an example, let's say that we would talk to someone on a 
Tuesday and make an appointment to see them on a Thursday or a Wednesday. Well, 
on Wednesday or Thursday, Cincinnati Bell would already be on the site without 
having been called," Stoner said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to other occurrences that he termed "curious," Stoner said: "I'm not 
convinced that it has stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lawrence Whalen and former Chief Carl Goodin, who headed the 
department from 1971 to 1976, have both denied any knowledge of wiretapping 
activities. They have yet to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chief Myron Leistler, who retired in 1985, invoked the Fifth Amendment 
last month when he was asked about wiretapping. 
</P>
<P>
A police sergeant who has been granted limited immunity from prosecution has 
testified that the police intelligence unit worked closely with Cincinnati Bell 
to perform illegal wiretaps and that the illegally gained information was 
shared with the FBI and other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The police intelligence unit even was supplied with Cincinnati Bell equipment, 
including a Bell truck, so that policemen who were capable of performing 
wiretaps could perform them on their own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence unit was created in 1968 to gather information about 
subversive groups and organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit, which was filed by three former policemen who say that 
they were themselves wiretap targets, allege that the unit quickly developed "a 
life of its own" and began investigating anyone it deemed "suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Some former officers allege that the police went so far as to deliberately set 
a fire that destroyed the offices of an underground newspaper, the Independent 
Eye, in 1970. That arson case is still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Draise and Gates also allege that they were involved in spying that took place 
at a General Electric plant here. 
</P>
<P>
Gates contends that he wiretapped two lines at the plant in late 1983 and early 
1984. Draise, who was permanently stationed at GE for 1 1/2 years to service 
their telephone system, said he gathered information on the plant's computer 
modems, data transmission lines and telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
The men said that they were ordered to do this by supervisors at Bell but that 
they have no idea how the information gleaned from the wiretaps was used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Is Investigating 
</P>
<P>
GE has refused to comment on the wiretapping stories, but the Mt. Washington 
Press, a weekly newspaper that has aggressively covered the scandal, has 
reported that the defense contractor is investigating a possible link between 
the alleged wiretaps and the loss of defense contracts to Pratt &amp; Whitney, 
a competitor in the aircraft-engine industry. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that GE had verified the presence of wiretaps on its 
telephones as recently as August of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Both Draise and Gates say that at the time of their firing, they had begun to 
question whether what they were doing was proper. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think that with drug dealers, the ends justified the means," Draise 
said. "I don't particularly like drugs, period. And however they put them in 
jail I don't care. But it was getting to the point where you had to ask where 
do you draw the line as to what is OK and what's not OK." 
</P>
<P>
The GE episode, which both men say they suspected was espionage, was the 
incident that first gave them pause, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Draise said the last straw came when he was asked to tap the phones of a 
columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer, Frank Weikle. He said he felt the police 
wanted the line tapped so that they could learn the identity of Weikle's 
anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
The men say they were told many of the wiretaps were for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Some local politicians were wiretapped, they were told, because they opposed 
Bell rate hikes. Sometimes, they said, they were asked by police officers and 
FBI agents to place wiretaps on other law enforcers, including two police 
chiefs and the special agent in charge of the Cincinnati FBI office, because 
the targets were suspected of improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this goes back to the 1950s and the era of McCarthy, with Hoover 
heading the FBI and conducting surveillance of American citizens," said Stoner, 
who was himself allegedly the target of wiretapping. "I think you've got a 
situation that started and never stopped, despite the fact that the FBI 
promised to cease and desist." 
</P>
<P>
A 1968 federal law forbade wiretapping except by court order or for reasons of 
national security. In either case, the attorney general is supposed to approve 
each instance of domestic electronic surveillance by federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it started with a monopoly that thought it could do anything and a 
justice system that was prompting it," said Stoner, "and I think it progressed 
from there to a situation where it was done with the local police." 
</P>
<P>
Draise and Gates said they were never challenged while on their wiretapping 
assignments. "Nobody ever challenges a telephone repairman when he's wearing 
his belt," Draise said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Top-Level Discussions 
</P>
<P>
Gates maintains that he met in parking garages with the late Cincinnati Bell 
President Richard Dugan three times to discuss his concerns about the wiretaps. 
He said he was assured that while wiretapping was a "gray area" of the law, the 
activities were "authorized." 
</P>
<P>
Bell spokeswoman Cantoni disputed this, saying: "We think it's very convenient 
that Mr. Dugan is dead and is not here to defend himself." 
</P>
<P>
Gates claims he first went outside Bell to get help to stop the wiretapping in 
1981, when he anonymously called the office of Ohio Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum. 
Later, in 1985, Gates and his attorney met with Rep. Bill Gradison to inform 
him of the wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gates and Draise say that they first were approached to do wiretapping by 
Police Sgt. Jerry Berry, who paid them up to $100 per wiretap out of a police 
informants fund. Later, they said, they received their orders from former Bell 
security officers Peter Gabor and James West, who have both denied the 
allegations. Draise and Gates said they were paid overtime for doing them. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations, which have shaken the faith many Cincinnatians had in their 
police force and in the phone company, also could have disastrous consequences 
in the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
One case based on possibly tainted police evidence was to come to trial on 
Tuesday amid fears that an untold number of previous convictions could be 
overturned if the wiretap allegations prove to be true. 
</P>
<P>
However, the defendant, Robert G. Joseph, an automobile dealer charged with 
mishandling federally insured loans to his dealership, pleaded guilty Thursday 
in a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer had argued that the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office illegally 
obtained evidence against him through telephone wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has testified that he wiretapped Joseph's lawyer and several members of 
Joseph's family on orders from his Bell superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph's attorney said after the plea agreement that he had been unable to 
identify what information the investigators got from wiretaps.

BONN, IN SHIFT, WILL PROBE FIRM OVER LIBYA PLANT

<P>
The West German government sharply reversed itself Friday as officials 
announced that legal proceedings will be undertaken against a West German firm 
that the United States has accused of supplying critical help to a Libyan plant 
it contends was built to make chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The about-face is causing considerable embarrassment in government circles. 
Only last week the Finance Ministry had cleared the firm, Imhausen-Chemie, in 
southwestern Germany, of involvement. But Friday, Werner Botz, a spokesman for 
the regional state prosecutor's office in Offenburg, announced that 
Imhausen-Chemie is under criminal investigation for possible violation of 
export controls dealing with materials that could have a military application. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Frey, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, 
confirmed that the investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
It has become clear that West German firms have been much more deeply involved 
with the Libyan plant than had been suspected, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
been forced to change his public position. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kohl angrily objected to U.S. leaks to the American news media 
accusing West German firms of helping the Libyans build the plant, which 
according to Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi is intended to produce 
pharmaceuticals. Other West German officials said their investigations had not 
turned up evidence of West German commercial involvement and complained that 
information provided by the United States had been inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kohl said in televised remarks that his government now has 
documents indicating that West German firms were involved in the design and 
construction of the plant, which is situated at Rabta, about 40 miles southwest 
of Tripoli, the Libyan capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Information' 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, Kohl's personal spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, admitted that the 
government had received "serious information" about Imhausen-Chemie from the 
BND, the West German intelligence service, as far back as October. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Friday that the 
United States had provided visiting West German officials with additional 
information on the nature of the Rabta plant and the involvement of West German 
firms in its construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussions have been useful and productive," Redman said. "We are trying 
to be responsible in providing as much information as is possible." 
</P>
<P>
The information was passed during a two-day meeting of American and West German 
technical experts that ended Friday. Redman said that details of the talks were 
kept secret because most of the information involved classified intelligence. 
He refused even to divulge the specific location of the talks, which were 
arranged earlier this week when Secretary of State George P. Shultz met with 
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Paris, where both were 
attending a 149-nation conference on chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Redman said that Bonn's finance minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, met 
Friday with Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead "to continue our 
high-level dialogue on the Libyan chemical weapons program." Stoltenberg was in 
Washington for talks on economic and financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, in a curbside news conference outside the State Department, said 
of Friday's news about the action against Imhausen-Chemie: "There was no proof 
a week ago . . . and now there is some new information in the last days . . . 
which could lead to criminal prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
But he said "it's not a final decision. . . . We must have complete evidence 
(to prosecute)." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials welcomed Bonn's decision to begin legal proceedings 
against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Kohl himself apparently had no knowledge of the BND reports from its 
agents in the Middle East when he was in Washington in November and met with 
Shultz, who told him what U.S. officials knew about the involvement of West 
German firms in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
Then and later, Kohl dismissed, apparently as inadequate, the American evidence 
of West German involvement. Several West German officials said they were 
surprised that Kohl took such a strong position on the U.S. charges even though 
it was clear that the CIA had some kind of proof. 
</P>
<P>
"If you noticed," a senior West German official said, "Genscher played it very 
cool and cautious. He did not deny the American evidence and called for 
stronger export controls immediately. Kohl, on the other hand, was very rash, 
very strong with his statements. And now he looks pretty silly." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, according to sources here, not only had intelligence from 
workers at the plant and satellite photos that established the plant's 
character; it had monitored communications between Libya and the German 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this evidence was in the form of communication intercepts," one source 
said, "and thus was very sensitive. To make it public would show that the 
United States could intercept and record telephone conversations between West 
Germany and Libya, and presumably elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Why the tardy reaction to the American evidence? 
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, in order for West German officials to accept the 
American evidence it had to be able to stand up in court, not just provide the 
basis for Bonn to undertake an investigation of its own. 
</P>
<P>
The West German magazine Bunte suggested that secret intelligence service 
reports were "misplaced" and that Kohl never saw the West German evidence in 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources suggested that West Germany's tradition of firmly supporting its 
companies' exports, no matter what the circumstances, has led to a 
head-in-the-sand posture when charges of illegalities are made. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's various federal and state agencies apparently took their 
unaggressive lead from Kohl, who had publicly dismissed the U.S. evidence and 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The head of Imhausen-Chemie, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, heatedly denied last 
week that his firm was in any way connected with projects in Libya. And after 
an investigation that lasted just three days, Finance Ministry officials 
absolved the company of any illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie on Friday said the firm 
would have no comment on the latest developments. 
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough in the case came with the report in the national magazine Stern 
that IBI Engineering, a company with a Frankfurt office and run by a 
London-based Iraqi national named Ihsan Barbouti, had served as a conduit for 
personnel, plans and supplies for the Libyan plant. IBI was reported to have 
coordinated, through Imhausen-Chemie, the construction of the Rabta plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits Libya Connection 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Times of London on Thursday, Barbouti admitted through his 
lawyers that he was a consulting engineer in Libya in 1985, and had been the 
contractor on many factories on the same site as the Rabta complex. He 
maintained that the controversial Rabta installation is a pharmaceutical plant. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that Barbouti organized the movement of supplies to Libya through 
the Frankfurt office and that the operation involved about 30 West German 
companies, several Austrian engineers and Swiss banks. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that equipment from many of these companies ended up in Libya 
after passing through middlemen. Stern said that chemical equipment was shipped 
under the supervision of the Hamburg office of a firm called 
Pen-Tsao-Materia-Medica, consigned that firm's subsidiary in Hong Kong, which 
represents Imhausen. The equipment ended up in Libya, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
Although IBI Frankfurt is now defunct, West German investigators have managed 
with Stern's help to obtain 12 cases of records from the company's former 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the records led Kohl to remark Thursday that "certain 
documents have been seized in the past few days from which some possible new -- 
something I don't know yet -- conclusive material could be borne out, and not 
just suppositions." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, Belgian newspapers disclosed that an Antwerp shipping agent 
named Jozef Gedopt confessed to falsifying freight documents for shipments of 
chemicals to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
An Antwerp magistrate, Walter Desmedt, confirmed that Gedopt had been arrested 
on export violation charges. Desmedt described the shipments as "everything to 
build a factory and chemical products used in the working of it." 
</P>
<P>
Gedopt reportedly forged documents to obtain export licenses on behalf of 
Imhausen-Chemie and other German companies. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive chemical plant materials were reportedly loaded in Hamburg and 
Antwerp and ostensibly bound for Hong Kong, but were off-loaded in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and his Cabinet, after staving off American warnings, are now urging that 
West German export controls be tightened on sensitive materials such as those 
that could be used in chemical warfare. But many American and West German 
observers believe that this reaction is somewhat belated. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative national daily Frankfurter Allgemeine observed Friday in a 
front-page commentary: "The Cabinet's decision to tighten export controls comes 
as a surprise, considering the politicians' statements of the past few days 
regarding the U.S. allegations. The German response that 'no evidence could be 
found of legal violations' did not really address the American accusations. If 
it is indeed true that no such violations occurred, why did Bonn suddenly 
decide to tighten export controls? 
</P>
<P>
"The logical conclusion can only be that German export practices and 
legislation provide grounds for complaints. Considering it took Bonn six months 
to proceed with investigations against the Imhausen firm, the sometimes-harsh 
U.S. campaign just may have been the last straw to spur the authorities into 
taking action." 
</P>
<P>
Ulrich Kienzle, a commentator for West German state television, said: "To put 
it harshly, the situation was akin to a free market in the means of mass 
destruction. No wonder the Americans have presented us with a long list of our 
sins." 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush, traveling Friday from Washington to Islamorada, Fla., 
where he is spending the pre-inaugural weekend fishing, appeared to be trying 
to smooth over any U.S.-German ill feelings from the affair when he said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans have had a chance to analyze this evidence, but I have never 
doubted Chancellor Kohl's commitment to the control and elimination of chemical 
weapons. . . . The more we can come together on this information, and what it 
means, the better it is." 
</P>
<P>
Bush called for more intelligence-sharing efforts between nations to root out 
suspected chemical weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after arriving at the Marathon, Fla., airport, Bush told reporters that 
he would strive to keep pressure on the world community to take action against 
countries producing chemical weapons. He characterized the Paris conference as 
a first step in world understanding of the inherent dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is . . . much more understanding now about that Rabta plant, and 
I think that's a good thing. But I think the way to approach it now is to build 
on what happened there (in Paris) in terms of worldwide understanding, to start 
with a determination to stop proliferation and then proceed as best we can to 
the process of elimination of both chemical and biological" weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Norman Kempster, in Washington, and Cathleen Decker, in 
Islamorada, Fla., contributed to this story.

A British Tornado fighter jet collided in the air Friday with two West German 
military aircraft and crashed near the town of Wiesmoor in the northwest corner 
of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The two crewmen in the British plane were killed, officials said, and a West 
German pilot was injured. Five houses were slightly damaged by falling debris 
but no injuries were reported among the townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is certain to renew public opposition to low-level military 
flights over West Germany, sources in Bonn said Friday. Officials of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization are concerned that a reduction in training flights 
will reduce combat efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's incident occurred when the British jet, which was on a routine flight, 
flew into a formation of West German Alfajet trainers preparing to land at 
Wittmund Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
The British plane collided with two of the West German planes, causing one to 
crash and the other to make a forced landing at the base. 
</P>
<P>
The British pilot and navigator were killed. The West German pilot whose 
damaged aircraft crashed was injured but parachuted safely to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the British plane crashed about 500 yards from a village school 
at Wiesmoor. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said the planes had been flying at an altitude of about 560 
feet over lowlands near the North Sea, just east of the Dutch border.

An Iranian leader, in Tehran's strongest condemnation so far, said Friday that 
Iran is disgusted by the fighting between rival Shiite Muslim militias in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party 
of God) militia and the rival Syrian-backed Amal group "are both committing 
murder and the Islamic Republic is disgusted," the Iranian news agency IRNA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
He told a mass prayer meeting in Tehran that the clashes are revolting. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran finances Hezbollah and praises it as the standard-bearer of true Islam 
in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
At least 116 people have been killed in the past two weeks in some of the worst 
fighting between Amal and Hezbollah in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

DEATHS UP 19% ON HIGHWAYS WHERE SPEED LIMIT WAS RAISED TO 65

Fatalities increased by 19% on rural highways on which the speed limit was 
raised to 65 m.p.h., an increase nearly three times as high as in states that 
kept the limit at 55, a government study has found. 
</P>
<P>
The study, released Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, is the first of three annual reports since Congress voted in 
April, 1987, to allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. on highways 
passing through rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
The study involved 38 states that raised the speed limit in 1987 and 10 states 
that did not. The report noted that all rural interstate fatalities increased 
in 1987 over 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The number of fatalities in the states that stayed with 55 m.p.h. increased by 
7%, a significantly lower increase than in those states that raised the speed 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic safety officials cautioned that the higher speed limit has not been in 
effect long enough to measure its long-term impact on highway safety.

PALL OVER A MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, a major new shopping mall in Southwest Los 
Angeles, has been billed as a showcase of business opportunity in Los Angeles' 
black community. So why was the experienced black manager hired to run the 
place suddenly ousted and replaced by a white person with no mall experience? 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Haagen, the developer of the mall project, insists that the dismissal 
of Louis George after only four months on the job was not racially or 
politically motivated. But the cold facts of the case raise troubling 
questions. George came to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza after managing three 
other major malls over the last 16 years. He has been replaced by Janice Hahn 
Baucum, an assistant manager at the plaza who had no experience in mall 
management before joining Haagen's development company late last year. Her 
co-manager is Leo Ray, a black architect who is also an associate of Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about George's removal have been raised not just because Baucum is 
white and inexperienced, however. She is also the daughter of Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who represents the South-Central Los Angeles 
area. Haagen is a friend and political supporter of Hahn and other members of 
the county Board of Supervisors. No one is suggesting that Hahn had any role in 
his daughter's sudden promotion. In fact, given the supervisor's long record of 
service to the black community and his reputation as a savvy politician, such 
an egregiously tactless move would be uncharacteristic. But what is going on? 
</P>
<P>
Local civil-rights leaders are understandably upset by the decision to replace 
George, who gave up a position managing a large mall in La Jolla to come to the 
Crenshaw district. John Mack, president of the Urban League, said that the 
black community "deserves some straight answers to some serious questions" 
about George's firing. We agree.

A BAD COMMITMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect George Bush has promised a continued flow of American arms to 
the guerrillas at war with the government of Angola, a most regrettable 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
We have been told that he promised the guns to facilitate national 
reconciliation talks and because he is convinced that the resumption of 
clandestine arms shipments by the United States in 1986 was a key factor in 
winning the Southern Africa peace agreement now in place. We think him mistaken 
on both counts. Reconciliation in Angola can best be spurred by leaving the 
conciliation to African states while cutting off the flow of arms that have 
devastated the land, killing thousands and leaving a terrible legacy of maimed 
civilians -- many of them the deliberate targets of guerrilla land mines. We 
are convinced that the peace agreement that has emerged is the result of South 
Africa's decision, after eight years of costly delay, to end its war against 
Angola and to grant independence to Namibia. The flow of American arms served 
essentially to prolong the violence and encourage South Africa to prolong its 
illegal hold on Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
We regret also the timing of Bush's initiative, coming just as the first Cuban 
troops were being withdrawn from Angola in conformity with the peace agreement 
that was negotiated by the United States. The principal function of the Cuban 
troops has been to defend the Angolan government, and the American petroleum 
installations in Angola, from attacks by South African troops and by the UNITA 
rebels armed by South Africa and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There is an ominous suggestion in this Bush initiative that the new 
Administration will pursue the failed policy of the old in terms of unleashing 
military power, instead of diplomatic power and economic reform, to address 
isolated crises in the developing world -- including Nicaragua. Peace prospects 
have been improved in Southern Africa because South Africa has decided to tame 
its bellicose policies against its neighbors, not because of the flow of U.S. 
arms to UNITA rebels. Peace prospects have improved in Central America not 
because American arms have raised the level of hostilities but because the 
leaders of the nations in the region have begun to take responsibility for 
ending the hostilities.

A CAMPAIGNER'S METTLE OF HONOR; 
</P>
<P>
IN POLITICS, AS IN BUSINESS, THE OFFICE DRUDGE DOES IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN FLORES, John Flores is a writer who lives on a farm in Grandview, Tex. 
He worked as materials coordinator for the Bentsen campaign. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the election season is history, I can relax and reflect on the 
experience. I was on the staff of Lloyd Bentsen's election committee (the 
successful one, the one that got him re-elected as Texas' Democratic senator 
while he was also running for vice president). It was the kind of job that 
everyone should have at least once in a lifetime. It was the kind of job that 
could make a troubled teen-ager go straight. 
</P>
<P>
There are not many paid staff members at a campaign headquarters; in fact, 
there are only a few key people -- people who know who they are, what they are 
doing and how to make others feel lost and confused. 
</P>
<P>
When a campaign is going full steam, people don't just move, they scurry, 
usually in a pack; you'll even see them trying to get through the front door 
all at the same time, like the Twelve Stooges. But not you; you just sit at 
your post waiting to do your job: answering the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
You are the telephone answering machine, and the reason they hired you is 
because you don't use batteries, and there is no assembly required. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings and rings while you are trying to assist an angry constituent 
who has just come in, and your boss comes by to yell at you for letting the 
phone ring too long. So you smile obediently and answer the phone while the 
constituent complains about you to the boss, who nods her head as if in 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you are the human answering machine, taking calls from everybody, all of 
them very important. These calls come in all at once when there are a hundred 
other important things for you to do. When you're caught up and sitting quietly 
in front of it, the phone only rings once or twice per hour. 
</P>
<P>
As your co-workers come in, they will ask if so-and-so called, and they will 
look through the messages you've just handed them, and then they will ask the 
question again. 
</P>
<P>
In a political campaign, as in any organization, there are three levels in the 
hierarchy: the Big Wigs, the Little Wigs and the Baldies. You can always tell a 
Big Wig, because he will never look directly at you while he's talking, but 
will mumble in your direction as he flips through the stack of messages you've 
taken for him. The Little Wig will go through his stack with eyes narrowed. If 
you've misspelled his name or circled a.m. instead of p.m. on the message pad, 
he will point out your error, especially if important people are sitting around 
waiting to see the Big Wigs. The Baldies are those little people like you who 
never speak and are just thankful to ever get a message at all. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign goes along like that, on the edge of the abyss of madness, and you 
stand in the middle of the chaos trying to please the Big Wigs, the Little Wigs 
and sometimes even a Baldy. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just when you are frazzled into an unidentifiable heap, your co-worker 
comes to you smiling and says, "The senator will be here Friday." 
</P>
<P>
So you clean and sweep and rearrange boxes, trying to make it look like you 
have hardly any campaign material left in hopes the senator will think to 
himself, "Hmmm, these people really know how to move campaign material." In 
reality he won't notice anything, because when he finally comes through the 
door, the press has preceded him, filling the place with grim and grizzly 
faces, flashing cameras and machine-gun bursts of questions, so he wouldn't 
know the rooms even had walls, let alone tons of carefully concealed campaign 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Friday comes, and there you are, standing by the phone when the 
senator arrives. His is the only calm face in the procession of Big Wigs, 
Little Wigs and a few straggling Baldies. He looks at you as he strolls past 
your desk, as if to invite a handshake, and you reach over, careful not to get 
too far away from your post, and he moves his shoulder a little, lifting a hand 
to meet yours. But the crowd cannot be stopped for even a short moment, and the 
pressure builds behind the senator's hesitation. You can almost hear knees 
locking like the wheels of some lurching locomotive being held in place on a 
railroad track. The senator reaches further, and you abandon your post 
altogether to grasp his hand and hear what he has to say. Your boss tries to 
distract him, pointing to the Little Wig who is standing first in line, but the 
senator ignores her, leans toward you and says, "Thank you for all your help." 
</P>
<P>
There is a moment of silence and then you think you hear the phone, but the 
sound is obscured by the procession in retreat. You return to your post and 
indulge in a smile.

There is no other way to describe this year's Rose Parade, than to say that it 
was a most outstanding, superb, fantastic, and smashing show on earth. 
Definitely the best. 
</P>
<P>
Above it, it couldn't have happened without all those talented people, who put 
this wonderful event together. They were blessed by God with special gifts.

Your series emphasized my biggest complaint with television coverage of the 
Rose Parade -- the cutting away from bands to provide commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Young people who are part of a school band are hard-working dedicated students 
who put in many hundreds of hours practicing their music, and marching 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving an invitation to march in the Rose Parade must be among the top 
recognitions those kids receive. Acceptance of such an invitation then means 
extensive fund-raising to allow their participation. 
</P>
<P>
Let America see these shining examples of dedicated and deservingly proud 
youngsters. Let the "folks back home" enjoy that surge of pride when their 
hometown band marches across the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Since sponsor fees are what provide the presentation to home viewers, the 
commercials are necessary. Certainly, creative people could devise a way to 
announce their sponsorship without cutting away from the parade.

U.S. NAVY SHOOTS DOWN 2 LIBYAN JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times editorial "America as Vigilante" (Jan. 5) was irresponsible, naive, 
and insulting to the men and women of America's armed forces and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Libya is a world leader in state-sponsored terrorism. Clearly, the facts have 
shown that the Soviet-supplied MIG fighter planes were taking aggressive action 
against U.S. aircraft over international waters. The Libyan jets got exactly 
what they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Libya poses a threat to vital U.S. interests in the region. They are a threat 
to Israel and to Arab states in the region who are striving for political 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
Libyan dictator Col. Moammar Kadafi's sacrificing of two aircraft may have been 
designed to divert attention away from the new chemical weapons plant. What 
else can you say about a country that is even building such a plant in the face 
of worldwide condemnation of such facilities? 
</P>
<P>
The Times editorial and other "blame America first" commentary only serves to 
undermine the high purpose of our Middle East policy, which aim to bring 
stability to the region and peace to the world.

I applaud your editorial stand against the "vigilante" role our country has 
assumed in regard to Libya. You are to be honored for resisting what Walter 
Cronkite called the "subtle ideological intimidation" which stilled so many 
critics of our past unilateral actions in Grenada and Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
The ideological intimidation isn't really subtle. The outcry about the "threat" 
from a nation of 3.9 million people is quite blatant. Can't we see that from 
the Libyan standpoint it is the U.S. who threatens them? We bombed them in 
April, 1986, in retaliation for a terrorist act in Berlin which belatedly was 
found to be attributable to others. We are fulminating against their possible 
production of chemical weapons, when we have that capability and a lot more. 
Our planes and warships are near their coast. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that our government will apologize, offer compensation, accept Libya's 
invitation to inspect the controversial facility, and henceforth abide by 
international law.

AMBASSADOR HOTEL CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The site of the closed Ambassador Hotel -- favorably situated on the main 
street of Los Angeles and not far from the heart of downtown Los Angeles -- 
should remain an urban oasis. The setback of the hotel building and the garden 
areas provides agreeable relief. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that, unlike some cities, such as London, Los Angeles has a 
paucity of green spaces. The suggestion for mixed use -- residential, 
commercial, and hotel -- sounds bad. Los Angeles already is built up just about 
to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the hotel can be preserved. If not, something else very special and 
equally meritorious, which retains the open space, should occupy the site.

PASADENA TOURNAMENT OF ROSES MARKS ITS CENTENNIAL FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Having been born and raised in Pasadena starting in 1914, I feel I have a right 
to complain about the commercialization of so many of the floats in the "modern 
day" Tournament of Roses parade. The parade was originally conceived as a happy 
and joyful celebration of the coming of the new year; not as a money-making 
advertising media for corporations. It is both derading and debasing to the 
original concept for these companies to compete for the biggest, the tallest 
and the most gaudy float. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the line the Tournament of Roses committee has lost sight of 
the original concept -- the personally decorated carriages, automobiles, and 
horses. My mother would spend days putting together a wreath and other 
decorations for dad's horse which he proudly rode to celebrate the New Year.

Your series on the Tournament of Roses was fascinating (Part I, Dec. 29-Jan. 
1). I have attended probably half of the 100 parades over the years, having 
been initiated by my late mother Grace Moore Gales, who was exactly 1 year old 
when the first parade was held. Seeing the 1913 picture of the woman in a cart 
drawn by the ostrich reminded me that my mother worked at the Cawston Ostrich 
Farm about then, and she once rode in the parade with her brother driving a 
decorated power lawn mower provided by the Annandale Country Club. How the 
floats have changed! 
</P>
<P>
If sponsoring companies calculate so carefully the cost of a float versus the 
minutes of exposure on television, I cannot understand why their drivers don't 
keep recommended distances from the participant ahead of them. Too many 
"tailgate" on the parade route as if they were in traffic rather than keeping 
back so spectators can fully enjoy each entry until it has completely passed 
by. Leaders of marching bands and banner carriers are even worse at tailgating. 
</P>
<P>
If committee members wants to get a cut of the vending money and benefit 
spectators too, they should sell an audio tape through street hawkers. Using 
information only available to the association, it would describe each float's 
motif and flowers, tell who is on board, give tales about horses and 
participating bands like one hears on TV. One does not have time to read a 
program about each float and watch it too, but one could listen to a tape while 
watching to enhance the enjoyment of the visual spectacle. One would just have 
to remember to bring one's own tape player or buy or rent one there.

RETIREMENT COMPLEX SOLD AT AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents wore buttons saying "Everything is Going to Be OK," but after their 
retirement village was auctioned Friday, they weren't so sure anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what will happen to us now," said Carl W. Segerhammar, 81, who 
has lived in La Serena retirement village in Thousand Oaks for six years. "It 
would be so expensive to move." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for LAV Care Corp., which bought the retirement home for $6 million 
by entering a last-minute bid, declined comment on the company's plans for the 
150-unit complex, where 85 senior citizens reside. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll let you know in two weeks," Ronald D. Aubert told a stunned group of 
about 10 elderly residents who attended the auction at a title company in 
Ventura. Many wore small buttons that said "EGBOK" -- shorthand for "Everything 
is Going to Be OK." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illinois Operator 
</P>
<P>
Residents had hoped that the financially troubled facility would be bought at 
the foreclosure sale by Lutheran General Health Care System, a retirement home 
operator based in Park Ridge, Ill., Segerhammar said. 
</P>
<P>
Lutheran General entered the second-highest bid -- $5.6 million -- but lost by 
$400,000 to LAV Care Corp. The bidding between four companies began at $2 
million and slowly rose in $100,000 increments. 
</P>
<P>
As the tension mounted, La Serena resident Mary Moe clenched her hands and 
muttered: "I'm praying, I'm praying." 
</P>
<P>
After the auction, George Caldwell, president of Lutheran General, said he was 
"very, very disappointed. We were interested in keeping La Serena the way it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Paula L. Gibson, a deputy attorney general attending the auction, said LAV Care 
Corp. must give residents 90 days notice and show "good cause" if it plans to 
close the facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company will "have to go through the standard planning process 
and hearings" if it wants to use the 6.5-acre retirement village for any other 
purpose, said Tammy McLean, a management analyst for the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Rough Night' 
</P>
<P>
"We're in for a rough night at La Serena because of the uncertainty," said 
Myrna Gordon, spokeswoman for Pacific Homes, which operates the retirement 
village at Moorpark and Olsen roads. 
</P>
<P>
Financial problems surfaced at La Serena last summer when officials of Pacific 
Homes issued 30-day eviction notices to residents, saying the complex was 
almost broke. 
</P>
<P>
The complex's owner, La Serena Manor, owed about $11 million, said Keith R. 
Marshall, a vice president of Security Pacific National Bank, one of the 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from Friday's sale will be distributed among the facility's 
bondholders, who will lose money on the investment, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the residents paid between $25,000 and $110,000 for apartments at 
the 7-year-old complex, Gordon said. Residents also pay from $850 to $2,800 a 
month in rent, depending on the size of their apartments and how much daily 
care they receive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Thousand Oaks officials and private donors provided $50,000 to keep 
the facility open long enough to find a buyer. In November, a Ventura Superior 
Court judge appointed an administrator to oversee the retirement home's 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for a new place since the summer but there is nothing 
comparable," said Elizabeth Broadston, 80, who has lived at La Serena six 
years. "Let's just hope the new owners keep it open."

DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS, TRAFFIC DEATHS DECREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs on San Fernando 
Valley streets decreased in 1988 compared to 1987, as did deaths in traffic 
accidents, the Los Angeles Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
There were 5,169 arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in 
1988, 612 fewer than the year before, a 10.6% decrease. 
</P>
<P>
There were 124 people killed in Valley traffic accidents, 10 fewer than in 
1987, a 7.5% decrease, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Major injury accidents -- in which people "couldn't walk away" and were taken 
to hospitals -- fell by 7%, from 855 in 1987 to 795 last year, Police Sgt. 
Dennis Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
Police attributed the decline in deaths and serious injuries to more people 
wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley had 16,763 reported traffic accidents in 1988, a 1.5% decrease from 
the 17,011 accidents in 1987. Reported accidents are those that police 
investigate because deaths, injuries, hit-and-run drivers, drunk driving or 
other crimes are involved. 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Bruce Mitchell said that for every reported accident, four are 
unreported, generally minor collisions in which only the vehicles are damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Valley's reported accidents, 48% involved hit-and-run drivers -- about 
the same percentage as in 1987, police said. 
</P>
<P>
For the city as a whole, hit-and-run accidents made up 45.7% of the 59,579 
reported accidents, Officer Paul Shumway said. The citywide rate for 1988 had 
not been calculated by Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Bartolotto, detective supervisor of the Valley Traffic Division, said 
some people flee after an accident, thinking that they will be arrested. But he 
noted: "It's not a crime to be involved in an accident. It's a crime to leave 
the scene of an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Other drivers run from the scene because they have "no license, no insurance, 
are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or are wanted for other 
crimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said some motorists simply panic. 
</P>
<P>
"When they calm down, it's already a crime because they left the scene," he 
said. "A person who's not normally a criminal becomes a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Officers issued 98,000 traffic citations to drivers in the Valley in 1988, a 
16.1% drop from the 116,831 given in 1987.

MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS, LANDLORD TO DISCUSS LEASE LIMITING INCREASES IN RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A card table at a Calabasas mobile home park today will be the center of Los 
Angeles County's latest fight against potential rent gouging. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 210-space Calabasas Village Mobile Home Park will be invited 
to sit down with their New York landlord to discuss a long-term lease that 
county officials are requiring him to offer to longtime renters. 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas residents are among about 10,000 mobile home dwellers in 
unincorporated county areas who are being offered the first leases that tie 
rents to levels to be set by future consumer price indexes. 
</P>
<P>
If park owners cannot come up with leases that residents will sign, they must 
offer alternative seven-year leases drawn up by county housing experts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began a Year Ago 
</P>
<P>
The lease requirement went into effect Jan. 20, 1987. County supervisors 
reacted to complaints that some park operators were ignoring voluntary rent 
guidelines issued by the county after formal rent control restrictions expired 
in January, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and the end of 1984, a county rent control ordinance limited rent 
increases to about 9% a year. In 1985, some parks raised their rents by 15% 
amid signals that future increases would total 60% or 70% by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Because modern mobile homes cost an average of $65,000, are often 64 feet long 
and 24 feet wide and anything but mobile, their owners worried that they were 
at the mercy of landlords who were free to raise rents as high as they wanted. 
"You can't move these things," said Calabasas coach owner Jack Flamer. 
</P>
<P>
A typical Calabasas Village rent that was $280 a month when rent control ended 
has increased to $430 per month, according to Flamer, a 14-year resident of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents -- those who have moved in since January, 1986 -- have been 
charged more. They are also exempted from the county's lease requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Described 
</P>
<P>
At Calabasas Village, 11 such newcomers have been told that their rents will 
increase from last year's level of $480 per month to $655 this summer and then 
to $685 next January, according to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we're going to do," said Ruth Willer, who has lived in the 
park 1 1/2 years. "My husband and I are both retired and we live on Social 
Security and a small pension." 
</P>
<P>
But longtime residents of the 50-acre park next to Mulholland Highway say they 
are generally pleased with their options. They have until Thursday to decide 
whether to pick landlord Lawrence Rosenthal's lease or the county's. After 
that, the county's offer will be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal and assistant Joyce Bernstein, both of New York City, have been 
camped in the park's recreation room for 10 days, revising their lease and 
explaining the options to a steady stream of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
They are using a personal computer set up on a card table to calculate future 
rents and print out legalistic-looking contract forms for tenants to sign. 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas Village Homeowners Assn. has urged that tenants delay signing any 
contract until the competing offers have been studied. Today's general 
membership meeting is designed to allow discussion of the differences between 
the two, said Murray Greenhut, association president. 
</P>
<P>
In general, both leases offer rents that allow similar increases that are 
pegged to future consumer price indexes. The county's lease would run for seven 
years with a cumulative increase of 17.7%. Rosenthal's would be renewable for 
up to 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
The leases differ in the way that they deal with the sale of mobile homes. 
Rosenthal's would tag on a 12% rent increase after a coach is sold the first 
time. The county's would add only a 5% increase after the first sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said she and Rosenthal have made up to three trips a month from New 
York in the past year to work out details of their proposed lease with the 
county Community Development Commission. That agency is in charge of the rent 
stabilization effort. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Kawczynski, the county's rent stabilization administrator, said most 
other mobile home park owners have simply adopted the county-drafted lease as 
their own offer to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exception in Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
Kawczynski said Friday that the one notable exception has been the 200-space 
Summit Mobile Home Park in Chatsworth. That park is claiming that it should be 
exempt from the lease requirement; a commission hearing on that claim is 
scheduled Jan. 26, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What is nice in parks like Calabasas is this is getting owners and residents 
together," Kawczynski said. "People there either weren't talking, or there was 
misinformation or mistrust." 
</P>
<P>
New tenants at the 100 mobile home parks have been excluded from the county's 
lease requirement because their rents were never regulated by rent control. 
"The rationale is the newcomers knew what they were moving into," Kawczynski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenhut said his neighbors are glad for the protection that they are getting 
-- although they rue the day that the county's rent control ordinance expired. 
He said he feels sorry for the unprotected newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come here as the last stop for what life is left to them," he said. 
"They face tremendous increases down the road."

"Plant your feet, stand firm and make your point" is the saying The Times

other teams out-rebound and (out)-run them. Meanwhile, the Lakers are running 
the same stale offense without the luxury of a dominating Kareem.

HILLBILLY COLUMN IS ENTERTAINING, BUT ALSO POINTS UP A PROBLEM

On one hand, I found Mike Downey's column of Jan. 1 creative and entertaining. 
On the other hand, I was aghast to find that he included phrases like "mixing 
up another batch of moonshine," "whut in tarnation," "I ain't never seen no 
television," "out thar," "whole danged country," "old jalopy," and "we's all 
kin."

Even though my family has lived in Southern California for more than 20 years, 
we still have to laugh about the ignorance of some people here (and all over 
the country) about West Virginia. When we tell people we used to live in 
Parkersburg, West Va., they ask, "Is that close to Richmond?" They don't even 
know there is a state of West Virginia. And they think hillbillies look stupid?

I read sports letters in wonderment at the attitude of Southern California

Last year Texas was 4-7 and on the wrong end of a couple of blowouts.

Instead of incessant criticism of a couple of top 10 football teams and

Before Trojan fans start placing "Bury Larry" bumper stickers on their cars, 
they should look at the overall picture: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Smith is the only active Pac-10 coach to have an undefeated 
conference record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is the only active Pac-10 coach to have won 10 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is the only active Pac-10 coach to guide his team to consecutive Rose 
Bowls in his first 2 seasons. (And before anyone moans about his Rose Bowl 
record, remember that Terry Donahue was 0-2-1 in bowl games before his current 
winning streak began.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith may have lost his last 2 games of the season, but wasn't there a 
coach named Lou Holtz who had the same experience last season?

POWER AND THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hedrick Smith's television series "The Power Game" proves again that even 
public television can succumb to pressures to please viewers at the expense of 
informing them ("Potomac 'Power Game' -- Rule No. 1 Is . . . Take Care of No. 
1," by Howard Rosenberg, Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with leading players in the "power game" drove home once again the 
expertise of the Reagan entourage in favorably shaping the President's image. 
But the account also distorted our understanding of how political power is 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
A more balanced analysis of Reagan's success would note that the public 
credited him with overcoming the inflation that had plagued President Jimmy 
Carter and with producing an expanding economy. Furthermore, without this 
foundation of public support, constructed largely out of economic conditions, 
the clever working of the media upon which Smith dwelled would have come to 
naught. Smith is quite aware of this. But why confuse viewers with the dry 
economics after the lively interviews with power brokers? 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Smith pause in his contrast of Carter and Reagan to point out that 
Carter's reliance on facts in his speeches failed for the same reason Reagan's 
image-building succeeded: The public would rather be entertained than 
confronted with unengaging facts. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Smith stands guilty of the same superficiality in his drive 
to please viewers that he finds objectionable in Reagan's methods of pleasing 
voters. But perhaps the more important lesson of this disappointing public 
television episode is that even our best political analysts often fail to tell 
the public of its responsibilities in driving the power game because the public 
does not wish to listen to this.

Here's a fantasy film about a woman who's scrambling to find justice in the 
corporate world. In the end, she receives justice.

But catch the credits that appear on the screen: Melanie Griffith gets third

MAISKY WITH L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mischa Maisky is a swashbuckler of a cellist. A compact, bearded man in a shiny 
gray shirt, he played Haydn's Concerto in C -- with the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday -- with an aggressive intensity 
little short of ferocity. Not exactly a stylistic marriage made in any purist's 
heaven, but it proved undeniably exciting. 
</P>
<P>
That was made immediately clear with his gruff, big-toned, heavily accented 
entrance. Maisky is capable of a pointed lyricism, though it seems more a 
calculated contrast than a natural effusion. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement level climbed precipitously in the Adagio, when Maisky broke a 
string. The cellist finished the movement in obvious distress, improvising a 
forgivably desultory cadenza on one string. 
</P>
<P>
He then swapped instruments with LACO second-chair cellist Nils Oliver. 
Apparently feeling he had nothing to lose, Maisky attacked the finger-busting 
finale with vigorous abandon. He never lost control of the music, however, 
playing cleanly and clearly on the unfamiliar instrument, and with remarkable 
elan. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, led by Iona Brown from the concertmaster's seat as usual, 
accompanied Maisky handsomely. Balances were always supportive and tempos 
accommodating in a performance that overcame stylistic incongruity and 
instrumental trauma with sheer verve. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the program displayed the sonic polish of the LACO strings to fine 
effect. Brown and Co. began with the Ricercar from Bach's "Musical Offering," 
in an imaginative arrangement by Neville Marriner, and continued with a crisp, 
buoyant account of Handel's Opus 6 Concerto Grosso in B minor, to which 
harpsichordist Patricia Mabee made a distinguished contribution. 
</P>
<P>
At the end was a luminous account of Schoenberg's "Verklarte Nacht." Attacks 
were occasionally ragged, and the dramatic line of the tone poem sagged at 
times. But for sustained aural reverie -- plush, richly romantic sound, yet 
transparent in texture when needed -- this was a cherishable performance. JOHN 
HENKEN

SKATEBOARD WIZARDRY IN 'GLEAMING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a genuine attempt in "Gleaming the Cube" (citywide) to deal with the 
impact the loss of a brother has upon a likable, footloose teen-ager. 
Unfortunately, the conventions of the action-adventure/youth-flick genres 
prevail. The result is an exploitation picture with a little something extra -- 
lots of awesome skateboard wizardry, culminating in a speed-of-lightning chase 
sequence, in which skateboards are pitted against cars. 
</P>
<P>
The film is geared ruthlessly to teen audiences. In fact, how many people 
beyond their teens know that its title refers to that exalted state a 
skateboarder attains at the top of his form? 
</P>
<P>
Christian Slater stars as Orange County teen Brian Kelly, spiky-haired and 
sloppy, for whom skateboarding has a far greater priority than his studies. But 
no problem: He has an adopted Vietnamese brother named Vinh (Art Chudabala), a 
studious and orderly youth, who'll do his homework for him. Then, shockingly, 
Vinh is found hanged to death in a motel room. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, only Brian suspects murder. He does get a local cop (Steven Bauer) 
to listen, but after a series of contrived macho clashes between the two, Brian 
takes matters into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Gleaming the Cube" is not the first movie to be set in part against Orange 
County's large Southeast Asian community. However, as in "Steele Justice," the 
film makers are interested in it primarily as an exotic backdrop for crime and 
violence. Surely, the majority of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees building 
new lives in America are not involved in gang warfare and other illicit 
ventures, but that's not the impression you get here. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Michael Tolkin provides only Slater with a role of much dimension, and 
this nervy, bright young actor, who played Jeff Bridges' eldest son in "Tucker" 
and Sean Connery's apprentice in "The Name of the Rose," involves us in Brian 
and his quest. Slater shows us Brian discovering how much brotherly love he 
actually felt for Vinh, love that had been repressed by resentment. 
</P>
<P>
We get precious few glimpses of Brian's parents (Ed Lauter, Nicole Mercurio) -- 
why, for example, wouldn't they have also suspected foul play in Vinh's death? 
Slater and Lauter have one good scene in which the father admits he failed to 
realize the impact upon Brian of his efforts to make his adopted son feel 
special. There's also an initially wary friendship between Vinh's demure 
girlfriend (Min Luong) and Brian, but action is the main attraction in this 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Director Graeme Clifford gets full value from the script (which allows Bauer 
and others little latitude). The action sequences do dazzle, and Clifford makes 
the most of the few quieter moments. The film's flashy finish smashes 
credibility to smithereens, but "Gleaming the Cube" (rated PG-13 for violence) 
has the feel of a film that turned out exactly as intended. KEVIN THOMAS

FAMILY SPOTS: DINOSAURS STEAL THE SHOW AT WEEKEND KIDS' EVENTS

If there's one topic that lets preschoolers rise above their preliterate 
limitations, it's dinosaurs. Today's youngsters can rattle off four- and 
five-syllable tongue-twisting names and identify dozens of silhouettes without 
skipping a beat. Anything with a dinosaur theme elicits squeals of recognition 
and delight. Two family events this weekend zero in on youngsters' fascinations 
with the prehistoric: 
</P>
<P>
Wonderworld Puppets presents "The Jerry Dinosaur Show" at the Torrance 
Community Theater, 1522 Cravens Ave., Torrance, at 10:30 a.m. today and Sunday. 
Froggie, Wonderworld's ongoing puppet hero, finds a dinosaur egg in his

PLANT OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FRENCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up to a foot long, the trumpet-shaped flowers of Brugmansia are the plant's 
main attraction: Nodding or pendulous, hanging like ornaments from tree-like or 
bushy shrubs, they are almost intoxicatingly fragrant at nightfall. The large, 
oblong leaves seem to pale in comparison and will get more sparse the colder 
the weather (Brugmansia is damaged by frost but will survive at 25 degrees). 
</P>
<P>
But Brugmansia can bloom all year: About two weeks ago, at the State and Los 
Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, Brugmansia cultivar "Charles Grimaldi" was 
blooming with golden flowers. (You can also see B. versicolor, with pale pink 
flowers, and the B. suaveolens, white, at the arboretum.) Specimens can also be 
seen in a wild, overgrown setting at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San 
Marino, and at the Hortense Miller garden in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the downside: All parts of Brugmansia -- the roots, leaves, flowers -- 
are highly poisonous. Taxonomists first placed these plants in the same genus 
as Datura, of which the extremely toxic jimson weed is a member, but then 
renamed the larger, tree-like Datura to Brugmansia because of their size. (In 
certain books and in the nurseries, Brugmansia may still be named Datura.) 
</P>
<P>
The Brugmansia species candida, arborea, suaveolens and aurea are frequently 
crossed, so that many colors and shapes of flowers are available. Flowers can 
be simply bell-shaped, more tubular and even double in form. Colors include 
salmon, red, apricot, yellow, white and pale pink. Some open up white and then 
start to take on their color. Most last about three days. 
</P>
<P>
Brugmansia grows 10 to 20 feet tall. Shrub-like in habit, it can be trained as 
a small tree as well. Usually given a dominant position in the landscape, it 
should be allowed plenty of room because of its large root system. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing as it is, it can be encouraged with extra water and fertilizer. 
Full sun or shade is fine as long as the plant is protected from wind. In 
sunnier locations, it needs more water. In very hot weather, the plant will 
wilt; to revive, give it water. But overall, Brugmansia likes a cool and moist 
environment, much like its native land, the mountains of South America. 
</P>
<P>
Pests include spider mites and cutworms. Richard Moriarty of Green Systems 
International, a Southern California grower of Brugmansia, recommends monthly 
sprayings of Orthene, if you notice any problems. 
</P>
<P>
Brugmansia plants will be on sale Jan. 21-22 at Green Systems International, 
20362 S.W. Birch St., Santa Ana, and will be priced according to size and 
variety. Green Systems also offers a Brugmansia information line to answer 
questions about care and planting; telephone (714) 754-5937. LINDA FRENCH

ROBERT SMAUS: GARDENING;

<P>
LOOKING FOR VARIETY? THE OUTLOOK IS ROSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the rose buying and planting season in full swing, how do you choose just 
a dozen from the hundred or so roses available at some nurseries? Well, you 
could try folding this column up and putting it in your pocket or purse and 
bringing it with you, because it lists some favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the fun of growing anything is taking a chance: You might find that a 
rose not on this list is just what you wanted, or that it is perfectly suited 
to your garden, so by all means experiment. But with these roses you are not 
likely to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
For our list, we polled Daniel Bifano, Santa Barbara rose judge and consulting 
rosarian; Northridge enthusiast James E. Sefton; Luis T. Desamero of Studio 
City, who edits the American Rose Society's Pacific Southwest District Proof of 
the Pudding survey; Julia Sudol of Alhambra, and Helen Thorne and her daughter 
Lois Penney of Bonsall -- all rose authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Not on this list of excellent roses are the new All-American Rose Selections, 
because most thought it too early to judge how these will perform in Southern 
California gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Some did venture that the grandiflora named Tournament of Roses had a nice 
form, but was a slightly "dirty" pink, while others thought that the 
cream-colored floribunda Class Act looked very promising, though a lack of 
fragrance and substance were noted. But these were only early reactions, so you 
will have to take your chances on the '89 roses. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, two miniature roses are All-American Rose Selection winners 
in '89 -- Debut and New Beginning -- but in general, more than a few rose 
aficionados think that the AARS roses are slipping in quality, and would enjoy 
seeing something really different come along. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, AARS roses have already stood trial in various rose gardens across 
the country, but roses that are great in Omaha are not always great in Los 
Angeles or San Diego. Comments from our authorities follow each listing here of 
great roses for Southern California. Many are AARS roses, but these have stood 
the test of time and are proven in the southern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Tried and True 
</P>
<P>
 Hybrid teas and grandifloras remain the most popular of roses, because their 
flowers are the most shapely and are the largest, with bushes to suit. Most 
grow easily to 5 feet and flowers usually come one to a stem (and stems are 
long enough for cutting). Favorite hybrid teas and grandifloras receiving three 
or more votes include (alphabetically): 
</P>
<P>
Color Magic -- Pink blend -- "a dramatic variegated pink" -- that is "one of my 
best" and "a must for the rose garden." 
</P>
<P>
Double Delight -- Creamy white-and-red flowers with a spicy fragrance; a 
favorite in Southern California because "sunshine brings out the perfection" of 
colors. "Outstanding" and "excellent for container growing." 
</P>
<P>
Duet -- Medium pink with "many blooms and excellent repeat bloom." "Excellent 
garden variety." 
</P>
<P>
Gold Medal -- Deep yellow that "missed being an AARS variety by one point." "A 
rose for all seasons, displaying masses of blooms all year." 
</P>
<P>
Honor -- White with "good foliage." "Queen of all the whites." "Always in 
bloom." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Lincoln -- Dark red and "the most fragrant of all the reds," though one 
person cautioned it is susceptible to rust and has at times "leggy growth." 
"Usually rated higher than brother-seedling Oklahoma, and probably is better, 
but not to quibble." 
</P>
<P>
Olympiad -- Medium red "now found in many gardens; becoming a great favorite," 
perhaps because "the brilliant color does not fade in the hot sun." 
</P>
<P>
Paradise -- Mauve, "silvery lavender shading to ruby red at petal edges." "An 
irresistible hybrid tea for lovers of mauve roses," and fragrant to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Pristine -- White with pink edges, "the perfect picture rose." 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth -- Pink "oldie but goodie," that is "always in bloom" and 
"warrants its royal name." 
</P>
<P>
Touch of Class -- Orange blend -- "pink-shaded coral and cream" -- that is 
"hailed as 'the Rose of the Decade' for its truly classical shape." 
</P>
<P>
Favorite Floribundas 
</P>
<P>
There are smaller roses called floribundas, which typically grow to 3 or 4 feet 
and have smaller flowers in clusters. Those receiving three or more votes 
included: 
</P>
<P>
Angel Face -- Mauve. The "color remains even and consistent" and "flowers hold 
well even in Valley heat," but "it grows and grows" and "will get huge if 
permitted." 
</P>
<P>
Cherish -- Medium pink with "massive sprays ideal for landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
French Lace -- White. "The perfection of the blooms will be admired by all." 
"The most perfect blooms." 
</P>
<P>
Iceberg -- White, or more precisely, "ivory to blush apricot." "Very fragrant, 
vigorous . . . a longtime favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Sexy Rexy -- Medium pink, "the new floribunda on the block that everyone is mad 
about." "Huge clusters of flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Showbiz -- Medium red with "large clusters of blooms that last nearly a month." 
</P>
<P>
Sunflare -- Medium yellow with "glossy foliage." "All perfect blooms, single or 
in clusters." 
</P>
<P>
Sunsprite -- Deep yellow, "fine, full foliage, many blooms." "One of the few 
yellow floribundas that perform well in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Others 
</P>
<P>
 Other roses were mentioned, so if you want to expand on this list, here are a 
few that garnered at least two votes and are known to do well in Southern 
California: Amber Queen, Aquarius, Blue Nile, Brandy, Fragrant Cloud, First 
Prize, Granada, Marina, Mikado, New Day, Oklahoma, Ole, Peace and Chicago 
Peace, Perfume Delight, Prima Donna, Redgold, Sheer Bliss, Sonia, Summer 
Fashion, Trumpeter, White Lightning and Voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
I think that some of these may be going out of fashion and may not be available 
at nurseries, but out of the 42 roses just listed, you're sure to find your 
dozen. 
</P>
<P>
(If you would like a Proof of the Pudding survey from the Pacific Southwest 
District, send a check for $2.50 -- made out to the American Rose Society -- to 
Luis T. Desamero, Editor, 3053 Laurel Canyon, Studio City 91604. The survey 
evaluates recently registered roses over a 3-year period and includes ratings 
of most other roses.)

GOETZ SENTENCED TO YEAR IN JAIL, TELLS COURT SOCIETY NEEDS PROTECTION FROM 
CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guards led subway gunman Bernhard H. Goetz from court Friday to begin serving a 
one-year jail sentence for carrying an illegal handgun, ending a bitter and 
controversial case that touched a raw national nerve over urban crime. 
</P>
<P>
During his dramatic court appearance, Goetz, who shot four young men he said 
were threatening to attack him on a subway more than four years ago, argued 
with the prosecution's contention that society needed to be protected from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of society than it 
is about me," Goetz told acting Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Crane before 
the judge pronounced sentence. "Society needs to be protected from criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Goetz started to sit down, but Crane asked if he had anything to add. "One of 
the fellows I shot was once arrested for robbing someone with a shotgun. He 
posted $200 and was back on the street. He never showed up (in court). Nobody 
bothered to arrest him," Goetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier in the small, crowded eighth-floor courtroom, prosecutor 
Gregory Waples had asked that Goetz receive a three-year prison sentence. "The 
defendant is a potentially dangerous person to himself and to members of New 
York society," Waples charged. It was that statement that prodded the slim 
defendant, dressed in his usual faded dungarees and sport shirt open at the 
collar, to reply. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing a $5,000 fine and the one-year sentence at New York City's Rikers 
Island jail, where Goetz will be kept under special protection, Crane stressed 
that, "On re-sentence, the court is still concerned about general deterrence . 
. . . It would not be unduly harsh to sentence Mr. Goetz to prison." 
</P>
<P>
Goetz could be eligible for release in 51 days, if the nine days he served in 
jail when he was arrested are considered. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz was acquitted in 1987 of attempted murder but was found guilty of illegal 
gun possession. He originally was sentenced last year by Crane to six months in 
jail and fined $5,000. But an appeals court overturned that penalty because, 
under the law, the minimum sentence for illegal gun possession is a year in 
jail, and the maximum is seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz shot the four black teen-agers, who he charged were about to rob him, on 
Dec. 22, 1984. Afterward, he fled to New Hampshire for several days before 
surrendering and making a videotaped confession to prosecutors. In the 
confession, he contended that the youths menaced him by surrounding him on the 
train before asking him for $5. Three of the teen-agers escaped permanent 
injury in the shooting. The fourth, Darrell Cabey, 22, is now paralyzed from 
the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
One of the youths, James Ramseur, who testified for the prosecution, is serving 
time in prison for the rape of an 18-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caused Widespread Debate 
</P>
<P>
The case soon sparked national and international debate over charges of 
self-defense, vigilantism and racism. 
</P>
<P>
To his supporters, Goetz, 41, symbolized the ordinary citizen standing up for 
his rights; his detractors viewed the gangly electronics technician's actions 
as a prime example of racially motivated violence. As national attention 
focused on the case, Goetz T-shirts were sold in New York. Slogans supporting 
his action appeared on billboards and walls. The comic strip "Doonesbury" 
satirized the intense New York tabloid coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
During his trial, the prosecution charged that Goetz was a troubled man with a 
history of gun possession -- a characterization Waples repeated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I submit there are no changed circumstances," the assistant district attorney 
said. " . . . (Goetz) expressed the opinion Judge Crane should have sentenced 
him to a testimonial dinner. The defendant has no insight into the crime 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting day today, judge, Friday the 13th," Barry Slotnick, 
Goetz's lawyer told Crane, "somewhat symbolic." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a symbol the jury system does work." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional appeal before sentencing, Slotnick said: "When a citizen's life 
is permeated by fear, justice must take recognizance of reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie Goetz was tried by a jury. . . . This jury found he made a sound 
decision when he pulled out his gun and fired," the lawyer said, stressing that 
Goetz had been mugged once before the incident on the subway occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Slotnick put his hand on the shoulder of his client, describing Goetz as "this 
tall, skinny man." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the perfect profile of a victim in New York," the lawyer charged. 
</P>
<P>
Slotnick told the judge that Goetz had "lost his anonymity, lost his business, 
lost his money, lost everything he had . . . . For four years, he has been 
under supervision of this court on bail. He has led an exemplary life." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . How much flesh can one judicial system eat out of this man's body, 
judge?" Slotnick asked passionately. "Don't send him to jail. Let him go home. 
I ask you for mercy, decency, humane treatment, most of all what's appropriate 
-- no jail for Bernhard Goetz." 
</P>
<P>
In deciding that a jail sentence was appropriate, Crane noted that the one-year 
sentence he imposed carries the condition of a 60-day conditional release in a 
gun case, if parole authorities agree. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Goetz's lack of remorse gave him concern that Goetz might repeat 
his behavior in using a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz's lawyers, challenging his conviction, have asked the U.S. Supreme Court 
to review the case. If the court decides to hear the case, the lawyers said 
they would request that the jail sentence be interrupted.

LAWYER LOSES APPEAL ON CONTEMPT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a judge's order finding 
embattled San Diego lawyer Richard Degallegos in contempt of court for his 
failure to turn over a former client's files to another attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon found Degallegos in contempt for 
misbehavior, willful neglect and violation of his duty to a client. Degallegos 
was sentenced to five days in jail, but he filed a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus, prompting the appellate court to release him pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a three-judge panel of the court heard brief oral arguments from 
Degallegos and Deputy County Counsel Gary Seiser before issuing their decision 
denying the petition. In an 11-page ruling, the panel rejected Degallegos' 
claim that he was unaware that attorney Diane Campbell was seeking the files of 
his former client, Victoria Manriquez. The court noted that Campbell had 
written two letters requesting the materials. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also found that Degallegos had the ability to comply with 
Campbell's request to deliver the files but "willfully" failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos, 48, said he will appeal the decision. The court ordered the lawyer 
to surrender at the County Jail downtown at 9 a.m. March 15 unless a reversal 
or a stay of the order is granted by another court. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was signed by Acting Presiding Justice Howard Wiener and Justices 
William Todd and Richard Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Bar took over Degallegos' San Diego law practice after 
Superior Court Judge Michael Greer found Degallegos incapable of serving his 
clients. Degallegos is appealing Greer's order. The Bar also is pressing 
charges against the attorney in connection with many complaints from clients 
who claim he failed to complete work he was paid for, missed court appearances 
and misappropriated funds. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos also is under investigation by the county district attorney's office 
and a federal grand jury.

OCEANSIDE TASK FORCE MAPS ATTACK ON GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The visible increase in the homeless people who drift aimlessly along 
Oceanside's streets and find shelter in doorways has spurred city and community 
leaders to establish a task force to find the best ways to help the city's 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
The Homeless Task Force, established earlier this week, will try to coordinate 
the efforts of social agencies that serve the city's homeless, said 
Councilwoman Lucy Chavez, who presented the group's objectives on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member task force, which includes representatives from social agencies 
and religious and business leaders, hopes to identify the specific needs of the 
different groups of people that constitute the city's homeless population, said 
Chavez, the group's chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
"There are various types of homeless people, various degrees of homelessness," 
Chavez said. "There are the migrant workers, the street people, homeless 
families, homeless teen-agers, the mentally ill and those who have drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There are various reasons why people become homeless, and they have to be 
treated separately," she said. "There is no one solution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Replace Agencies 
</P>
<P>
The city's task force has no plans to take over existing agencies or finance 
homeless services, Chavez said. But it will assist such agencies in finding 
funds to expand and help establish a list of short- and long-term priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can figure out a way to immediately help, say the homeless street 
people, especially with the recent cold weather, we will," Chavez said. "But 
the task force was not established to be a Band-Aid. This will be a long, 
analytical study to find a long-term solution, not a quick fix." 
</P>
<P>
For example, task force members are likely to consider establishing 
"transitional housing" in the city, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Such housing plans provide homeless people with temporary residences and often 
special assistance to enable them to regain autonomy. Transitional housing can 
include medical care, counseling, child care and job-training programs, Chavez 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in the quick fix where we house them overnight and kick 
them out the next day," Chavez said. "For those people that can be 
rehabilitated, we want to find a way to get them back into the mainstream and 
be productive." 
</P>
<P>
The group's immediate goal is to assess the size and composition of the city's 
homeless population, which is believed to have increased in recent years. The 
task force's inaugural meeting is scheduled for Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any statistics" about the size of the homeless population, she 
said, "but you can see the homeless street people sleeping under door fronts 
and under bridges. We're getting more phone calls from people concerned or 
complaining about the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining such statistical information is necessary to receive state or federal 
assistance, said Councilwoman Melba Bishop, who is also on the task force. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to find as many funding sources as possible," Bishop said. "But, 
when we apply, the first thing we'll be asked is, 'How did you document your 
need?' If we can't tell them, we won't be getting any money."

SAGON PENN'S FATHER ARRESTED BY U.S. AGENTS IN DRUG PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Penn, father of Sagon Penn, was arrested Friday by federal undercover 
agents after allegedly agreeing to sell them 3 pounds of rock cocaine for 
$54,000. 
</P>
<P>
Special Agent in Charge Charlie Hill, who heads the San Diego office of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, said Penn, 50, was arrested outside his Logan 
Avenue apartment when he demanded the money from agents sitting inside an 
unmarked car. Hill said 12 people were arrested in the case, which stemmed from 
a federal indictment that will remain sealed until the suspects are arraigned 
in U. S. District Court next week. Penn was named in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hill, Penn and five other suspects were arrested at Penn's 
apartment. Agents recovered about 3 pounds of rock cocaine and 3 pounds of 
cocaine powder at Penn's residence, Hill said. Although one suspect was armed 
with a .22-caliber handgun and agents found a .38-caliber revolver in Penn's 
apartment, the arrests occurred without incident, said Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the federal penalty for possessing more than 50 grams of rock cocaine 
with intent to sell is 10 years to life in prison and up to $4 million in 
fines. But a recently enacted federal Omnibus Crime bill doubles that penalty 
because the cocaine was being sold within 1,000 feet of a school, in this case 
Knox Elementary, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill declined to release any more details of the case because the indictment is 
still under seal, but said that Penn and the others had been under 
investigation for some time. He said that agents were sent to Penn's apartment 
to arrest several people named in the indictment. When they arrived, they 
negotiated with Penn to purchase 3 pounds of rock cocaine, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The agents reported that Penn instructed them to leave for a while and return 
later after he and other accomplices finished converting cocaine powder to rock 
cocaine. When the agents returned, Penn walked outside and asked agents inside 
an unmarked car to pay him $54,000 for the rock cocaine, Hill said. Penn and 
five others in the apartment were promptly arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde L. Spears, 36, identified by Hill as a gang member, is alleged to be 
Penn's drug source. Spears was among the suspects arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Penn's son, Sagon Penn, was found not guilty in 1987 in the March 31, 1985, 
shooting that left one policeman dead and another policeman and a civilian 
wounded. Two juries found that the policemen had provoked the incident by using 
racial slurs and unnecessary force when they stopped Penn for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
After Sagon Penn's arrest and during his two sensational trials, Thomas Penn 
repeatedly called for better relations between police and black residents of 
Southeast San Diego.

JUDGE REMOVES CITY, 3 OFFICERS FROM SUIT OVER BORDER SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Friday removed the city of San Diego and three city police 
officers as defendants in a $20-million wrongful-death suit stemming from the 
shooting death of an illegal alien near the U. S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Cesar Solis remains as the sole defendant in the case. Court 
testimony indicated that a shot fired by Solis most likely resulted in the 
death of Julio Arroyo Zaragoza, a 33-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who was 
killed May 4, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After a weeklong trial, the case is scheduled to go to the jury next week. Both 
sides rested their cases Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Saved by Vest 
</P>
<P>
The shooting generated a whirlwind of controversy at the time. A Border Patrol 
officer, Fred Stevens, was shot five times during the incident but survived, 
thanks largely to a bulletproof vest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's family, which is pressing the suit, has maintained through their 
attorney, Jose E. Tafolla of San Diego, that Arroyo was the victim of a 
"summary execution" by members of the Border Crime Prevention Unit, a special 
task force of officers from the San Diego police force and the U. S. Border 
Patrol. Unit members patrol the border canyons seeking to deter crime against 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. ruled that evidence indicated it was 
"ludicrous" to contend that any city policy resulted in the alleged "execution" 
of Arroyo. The three other officers named in the suit -- Larry K. Bender, M. 
Mendez and M. Rosario -- did not shoot Arroyo and therefore should be dropped 
as defendants, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Much of the testimony during the trial has focused on conflicting comments from 
pathologists as to whether Arroyo was shot at close range -- that is, whether 
he received a so-called "contact" type wound that is associated with 
execution-style slayings. Two experts called by the family testified that his 
wound might fall into that category, while two pathologists called by the city 
said the wound was inflicted from a greater distance. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have maintained that the shooting was justified because Arroyo and 
his brother Jaime had been robbing aliens with weapons and attempted to shake 
down the task force when the confrontation occurred. Jaime Arroyo, who survived 
the incident, was convicted of conspiring to commit robbery and of attempted 
murder and is serving a nine-year term at Soledad State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's widow, Maria de Zaragoza, and her four children, residents of Mexico 
City, have contended that the two brothers were guides leading a group of 
migrants through the canyons when they were attacked by the officers, whom the 
Arroyo brothers thought were bandits. The family charges that Julio Arroyo was 
shot through the center of his forehead as officers were placing handcuffs on 
his wrists.

MAN FIGHTS THEFTS OF CHINESE SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Caesar Wu picked a Chinese name for his fledgling real estate company in 
San Marino, he settled on two Chinese characters that mean "great prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
That was exactly what he expected when he opened a branch of his business in 
November on Huntington Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But what he got was great trouble and misery. 
</P>
<P>
Wu's efforts to mount two one-foot-high blue plastic Chinese characters on his 
building have sparked complaints from some longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although use of the characters above the company's English sign is legal under 
a city ordinance requiring English on 80% of a sign, dozens of people called 
City Hall to complain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stolen 5 Times 
</P>
<P>
And in the past two months, the characters have been stolen five times. They 
have been replaced each time at a cost of $140 and then stolen again within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what to think," said Wu, a Monterey Park resident who came 
to this country 22 years ago from Taiwan. "But we're not going to give in. We 
have to let people know that we stand by our rights. You can't let people push 
you around." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Paul Crowley has tried to calm the situation by writing a letter, 
published in the San Marino Tribune, explaining that Wu's sign is perfectly 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said that the thefts have probably been committed by mischievous 
teen-agers and that the whole situation is a "tempest in a teapot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Festering Resentment 
</P>
<P>
But others in San Marino are not so sure. Police Cmdr. Paul Butler said some 
parts of the community hold a festering resentment against Chinese newcomers, 
who now make up 35% of the city's population. "It may be an isolated incident, 
but there are a lot of bigots out there," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marino Tribune in an editorial has condemned the thefts as "blatant 
bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
Wu, who started his company last March in Alhambra, has plotted a moderate 
course, saying he is worried but still not sure that the thefts are motivated 
by racism. 
</P>
<P>
But if the situation continues and the city fails to catch the vandals, he 
said, he may call on the Chinese community to help, although he is not sure 
how. 
</P>
<P>
Wu's sign is not the first to use foreign words in San Marino. Just down the 
street, the Shanghai Palace restaurant has had a sign adorned with blazing red 
and yellow characters for 14 years. The East-West Federal Bank also has a sign 
that uses Chinese characters in its company logo. Both companies say they have 
never had any problems with their signs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
Before Wu put his sign up, he tried to make it as unassuming as possible and 
agreed to every suggestion made by the city. 
</P>
<P>
He originally planned to put up 10 Chinese characters on the building above the 
company's English name, Golden Acres Realty Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the city's prodding, he reduced the number to four characters 
and finally to two. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't get any smaller than that," Wu said, adding that he needs a Chinese 
sign because many of his clients are from Taiwan and Hong Kong and do not read 
English well. Wu said the business in San Marino has not been open long enough 
for him to determine how well it will do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Complaints 
</P>
<P>
With the city's blessing, Wu put the two characters on the building and 
immediately began receiving complaints. "They weren't threats, just 
objections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The callers' main concern was that Wu's two characters were a sign that 
Huntington Drive was turning into a replica of Alhambra's bustling Valley 
Boulevard, one of the main Chinese commercial streets in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody immediately began equating those two characters with Valley 
Boulevard," Crowley said. "That's just ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Wu added: "Even the Chinese don't want Huntington to look like Valley. I don't 
want it to look like that." 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, Wu's sign was stolen. The characters were mounted about 20 
feet above the sidewalk and had to be pried off by someone standing on the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrols Ineffective 
</P>
<P>
The police increased their patrols around the company, located at the busy 
intersection of Huntington Drive and Del Mar Avenue, but it didn't stop the 
sign from being stolen four more times. 
</P>
<P>
The last theft occurred just before the end of the year, and Wu plans to put up 
a replacement. He has no idea how long that sign will last, although he said 
with a touch of resignation that it may not survive much longer than the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that no matter how many more signs are stolen, he will continue to 
put up new signs as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If I took the sign down, I would have more Chinese people attacking me, 
saying, 'Are you giving in?' " he said. "That would really hurt my business."

WEEKLY 'CRUISE NIGHT' IN DOWNEY; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVE-IN TURNS THE CLOCK BACK TO '50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buddy Holly's 1957 classic "Peggy Sue" boomed over the disc jockey's sound 
system as patrons wandered about the parking lot at Johnie's Broiler drive-in 
restaurant in Downey. Some eyed the pre-1970 cars; others grooved to the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
It was 6 on a Wednesday evening -- time for the weekly "cruise night" at the 
former Harvey's Broiler drive-in on East Firestone Boulevard, known as the 
area's coolest cruising spot of the late 1950s and early '60s. As it had done 
in that era, the restaurant was spinning rock 'n' roll and turning its 
floodlights on more than 160 vintage cars. 
</P>
<P>
Many cruisers had come from the San Fernando Valley and Palm Desert. Why come 
so far just to park your car and look at other parked cars? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm never too old to cruise," said Tony Perez of Whittier. His 1949 
black Mercury, which he named the "James Dean Special," came with two 
scrapbooks on the '50s heartthrob. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Brings Back Memories 
</P>
<P>
"This was our old stomping ground," said Marty Krumm, 44, who grew up in 
Downey. "You got your cherry Cokes and hamburgers and circled around Harvey's. 
I look at these cars . . . they're all classics. It brings back so many 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
The cherry Cokes and hamburger plate specials still dominate the restaurant's 
menu, although the prices have nearly tripled. Most of the time they are served 
by the same carhops who waited on the coupes and roadsters almost 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When Harvey's opened, one of its first cruisers was Duke Hingley's green '40 
Ford sedan. Hingley, 50, of El Segundo, has been interested in classic 
automobiles since he was 13. He owns a red '34 Ford roadster and two '40 Ford 
coupes. Some cruising mobiles are worth more than $100,000, while the average 
price is about $15,000, aficionados say. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can afford to indulge in repairing and spiffing up the cars we just 
dreamed of having when we were younger," Hingley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Authentic 1950s Style 
</P>
<P>
Lee McCullough, a former cruiser, started cruise night at Johnie's in March, 
1987. His intention was to create a family-style atmosphere where everyone 
could step into the past, enjoy the classic automobiles and talk about old 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see the old spirit of the drive-in back again," said Chris 
Smyriniotis, Johnie's owner. He said Johnie's is one of the few '50s drive-in 
restaurants still around, and its flavor of authenticity keeps drawing people 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Bush, 39, of Rowland Heights, who has missed only one cruise night, wore 
his Elvis Presley applique jacket and pompadour hair style for the occasion. 
His red '51 Chevy is one of more than 6,000 pre-1970 cars that has passed 
through the lot since McCullough started cruise night. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an essence this restaurant has that none other has. We can relive the 
time we spent here, the girls we went out with. . . ," said McCullough, 46, who 
cruised the drive-in when it opened in 1958 as Harvey's Broiler. In 1965, 
Harvey Ortner sold the drive-in to Smyriniotis, who changed the name to 
Johnie's Broiler. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Rules Are Simple 
</P>
<P>
"Harvey had no idea that 2,000 cars a week would go through this spot," 
McCullough said. "This was the most premier spot in the Southland. The rules 
then were simple; stay in your car and keep moving. You stopped for food 
service, but that was all." 
</P>
<P>
The rules now for Wednesday cruise night are also simple: no post-1970 cars, 
animals, alcohol, tire burnouts or loud radios. Cruisers pay the $1 admission 
and enjoy the sights. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a raffle, with Elvis Presley photos, cassette tapes of '50s music 
and car posters among the prizes. And Harvey's Broiler T-shirts and sweat 
shirts have no problem selling.

MENTALLY ILL WHO ABUSE DRUGS FIND HELPING HAND AT THE RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Scales smiles shyly as she chops celery sticks for dinner in the mess hall 
kitchen. But her cautious self-assurance hides an eight-year struggle with 
severe depression and addiction to cocaine, PCP and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old had already been shuttled through eight months of drug and 
psychiatric programs at various hospitals before she arrived at The River 
recovery center about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked away in the Angeles National Forest north of Glendora, the 26-bed 
hillside facility opened two years ago. It was the first residential center in 
California to serve chronically mentally ill substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
What makes The River's program different, Scales says, is the sensitivity of 
the counselors to her dual problem. 
</P>
<P>
Funded through a unique collaboration of Los Angeles County's drug, alcohol and 
mental health administrations, The River is the only facility in the county 
providing integrated care for patients suffering from both substance abuse and 
mental illness, a population referred to as the dually diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
Programs administered by the county Mental Health Department and the Department 
of Health Services' offices of alcohol and drug abuse provide $500,000 of The 
River's $750,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Figure 
</P>
<P>
A key figure in The River's creation was Christopher Spencer of Monrovia, a 
recovering alcoholic whose 23-year-old daughter suffers from schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were falling through the cracks," the 44-year-old developer said. 
"I know how it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1986, he bought 70 acres in the Angeles National Forest with the idea of 
opening a facility for the dually diagnosed. He fixed up the abandoned 
California Conservation Corps camp that now houses the facility. Together with 
Bud Hayes, now executive director at The River, Spencer went to the county with 
the proposal. Spencer, who is a member of The River's board of directors, 
recently had a satellite dish installed so residents could watch cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it would be a good place for healing, up in the mountains," he said. 
"For the mentally ill, it's real nice because we don't have to use locked 
wards. People actually do cooking, go on hikes." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the facility's remote location, residents would have to take a long 
walk for a beer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Location Crucial 
</P>
<P>
Hayes noted that a major reason that the project was launched so smoothly was 
the site's location. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no community anywhere that's not going to fight this type of project 
in the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The River is just one of Spencer's many forays into the recovery field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he renovated a dilapidated hotel in downtown Monrovia, transforming it 
into a 32-bed treatment and extended-care center for alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that facility, a 25-bed facility for men in Covina, a 14-bed women's 
home in Arcadia, and a 25-bed center in Silver Lake for both men and women make 
up the Spencer Recovery Centers for recovering alcoholics. The River is the 
only facility run on a nonprofit basis. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who will receive the Monrovia Chamber of Commerce's Citizen of the 
Year award next month, volunteers at the Weingart Center for the homeless on 
Los Angeles' Skid Row. And he is the Friday cook at the Union Station 
Hospitality Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Services Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Substance abusers have been identified as among the most under-served of 
California's homeless mentally ill in a February, 1988, report by RAND Corp., a 
Santa Monica-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Providing assistance to the dually diagnosed is a growing issue nationwide, 
said Fred Osher of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He visited 
The River last year as part of a national survey of services available to this 
group, which has been reported to be as large as a million people. 
</P>
<P>
"The River is at the forefront of developing residential facilities" throughout 
the United States and is a model system within California, Osher said. His 
study was partially funded by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60% to 90% of mentally ill adults between the ages of 16 and 40 
are believed to have drug or alcohol problems, according to Hayes. Because of 
the lack of services for the dually diagnosed, he said, many patients have been 
put through a frustrating revolving door, referred back and forth between drug 
abuse and mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said he is thriving on the challenge of designing an integrated program 
and cross-training a staff that has never tackled the problems of mental 
illness and substance abuse simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me," he said. "It's an 
opportunity that somebody in the nonprofit field hardly ever gets a chance to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
At The River, residents are involved in designing their own recovery programs. 
Instead of concentrating on drug therapy and 
</P>
<P>
psychoanalysis, the focus is on group interaction and developing social support 
systems. All residents participate in community self-help groups, such as 
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also learn about thought and mood disorders, and they are taught 
independent living and coping skills. In addition to being assigned chores, 
they are given lessons on day-to-day living, such as money management and 
applying for discounted bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who qualify for federal Supplemental Security Income contribute their 
board-and-care allowance of $572 monthly. The remainder of the $3,000 a month 
it costs to treat each person comes from the county. Few can afford to pay 
their own way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Turned Away 
</P>
<P>
While six extra beds remain empty for lack of funding, about 10 dually 
diagnosed patients are turned away daily, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Clients, 90% of whom are homeless, may stay up to a year, but most leave after 
four months, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the 134 who have left The River are now abstinent, program 
director Julie Boynton said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good for this population," about double the usual success rate, 
said Al Wright, director of the county Department of Health Services' Office of 
Alcohol Programs. He acknowledged that alcohol programs "traditionally are not 
structured to deal with people with mental problems. We'd refer them to the 
mental health system." 
</P>
<P>
Boynton described her clients as often "young, middle-class individuals whose 
families have just run out of the ability to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'God's Gift' 
</P>
<P>
One 21-year-old resident, declining to give his name, described the program as 
"God's gift for those who have my problem, and there're lots like us." A 
student in English and political science before his illness interrupted his 
studies, he arrived at The River two months ago addicted to marijuana and 
cocaine and suffering from manic-depressive illness. 
</P>
<P>
Although he received psychiatric help in other programs, he said, his substance 
dependency was ignored. "I had another problem and they couldn't do anything 
about it, and I didn't know where to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such fragmentation of treatment is very difficult for this population," 
Boynton noted. State funding policy dictates that separate programs only handle 
the problems that they were created for. A more fundamental obstacle, she said, 
is the rigidity of each program. 
</P>
<P>
The mentally ill are often turned away from drug programs because the programs 
forbid them to take any drugs, including their psychiatric medication. 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse counselors are unable to distinguish between the drugs' life-support 
properties and their narcotic-abusive properties, Boynton said. 
</P>
<P>
More basically, she said, those counselors do not know how to interact with the 
mentally ill. "If you confront a paranoid schizophrenic any way but gently, you 
run the risk of being hit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug-Free Environment 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Irma Stantz, director of the county Department of Health Services' Drug 
Abuse Programs Office, said programs funded by her office aim for a drug-free 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
As long as patients are stable enough to participate, they can remain in a 
program, but there is no physician to oversee dispensing of drugs "if they need 
a strong tranquilizer or medication for manic depression," she said. "We're not 
a psychiatric facility. . . . If it's clear they're mentally ill, they are 
referred" to a mental health center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mental health programs are reluctant to test for drug abuse because 
to do so is considered an invasion of privacy, she added. In contrast to the 
traditional approach, in which discussion of the mental illness is not 
encouraged, The River's clients are educated about their problems and 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its contract with the county, The River staff shares its experiences 
with county workers at in-service training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Policies need to change, and the way to change those policies is to get people 
educated," said Gary Stansberry, intake coordinator at The River. He recently 
gave a lecture to drug and alcohol counselors undergoing training. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Interested 
</P>
<P>
Others are tapping The River's expertise as well. 
</P>
<P>
A private foundation gave the facility $5,000 last year to provide training 
toward developing similar programs in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the facility received $34,000 from the California Community 
Foundation -- which manages charitable contributions by major corporations in 
the state. The funds are being used to develop services for the county's dually 
diagnosed, including as many as 30 long-term housing units. 
</P>
<P>
That project should be realized within nine months, Hayes said, adding that the 
facility will provide accommodations for patients' dependents.

ABSENCE OF MOORE MAKES CSLA LESS DIFFICULT FOR CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if Cal State Northridge needed any help -- and for a while, it appeared as 
if it would -- Cal State Los Angeles benched its best player for disciplinary 
reasons Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodney Moore, the Golden Eagles' top scorer and rebounder, was suspended for a 
game by Coach Henry Dyer for missing a practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
What horrible timing. Cal State L. A. would normally need not one, but a couple 
of more Moores to be competitive in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
The Eagles came into their conference opener at home against CSUN with the only 
losing record (2-11) among CCAA teams in nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
But for almost a half, Moore's absence seemed to adversely affect Northridge 
more than Cal State L. A. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Matadors took a commanding edge and won fairly easily, 69-55, 
running their record to 10-4 and handing the Eagles their ninth consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge played as well -- and as poorly -- as it had all season during 
segments of the game. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy seemed fairly confident of the reason. "A lot of that 
was mental," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jemarl Baker, 1 of only 2 CSUN players to shoot better than 50%, said that it 
was tough to keep a competitive edge against the outmanned Eagles, who laid a 
goose egg over the course of the 14-game conference schedule last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were talented," Baker said. "We came here ready, but you don't 
come in ready to play as hard as you would against a Bakersfield. You try, but 
it's hard to do." 
</P>
<P>
Such problems never would have become apparent if the Matadors had made some 
easy shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which had shot less than 40% in its previous 2 games, made only 
38.2% of its attempts in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we came in with full concentration," Cassidy said. "We missed 
a lot of layups and around-the-basket shots." 
</P>
<P>
Said Baker: "We were getting a lot of open shots, we just weren't making them." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Matadors led at the half, 31-23. Northridge was fortunate in that 
as poorly as it played in the first half, Cal State L. A. was equally bad. In 
some cases worse. The Eagles shot only 31.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Northridge didn't take the lead for good until 2:39 remained in the 
half. A jump shot by Darren Matsubara put the Matadors ahead, 24-23, and 
ignited a 9-0 run to end the half. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous 8 minutes, CSUN had managed only 1 basket, a jump hook by 
center Todd Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
"There were stretches I thought we played very well. It was like, 'See, coach, 
we can do it,' " Cassidy said, sticking his tongue out to mimic the attitude of 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge shot 56.5% in the second half and twice opened 20-point leads. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Derrick Gathers ended his 2-game shooting slump for the Matadors, scoring 
a game-high 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. 
He also had 8 rebounds and 4 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara added 12 points for CSUN, while Bowser had 11 points and 8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge put Cal State L. A. away early in the second half, outscoring the 
Eagles, 9-2, over a 2-minute stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive steals by Matsubara, Gathers and Kris Brodowski resulted in 4 
points and the Matadors had a 42-27 advantage only 5 minutes into the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
After Bruce Turner scored on a layup with 2:23 into the second half, the Eagles 
scored only 2 points over the next 7 minutes as Northridge ran out to a 
20-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Turner led the Eagles with 13 points. David Porter added 11, but made only 5 of 
19 shots.

SCHWAN SHAKES LOOSE TO HELP WESTLAKE END SIMI VALLEY STREAK AT 31 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week will be known as the week of broken streaks. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Rio Mesa High ended Buena's 24-game winning streak in the Channel 
League, and Friday night it was Westlake's turn to end an even longer one -- 
Simi Valley's hold on the Marmonte League that spanned 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
Even before tip-off, Westlake Coach Greg Hess recognized the setting's portent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the chemistry is right tonight," Hess said. "This is Friday the 13th 
and their streak is 31, with the numbers and everything we are ready. I wonder 
if the moon is out tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The moon, chemistry and omens aside, Westlake received 23 points and 12 
rebounds from 6-9 center Kurt Schwan to lead the Warriors past Simi Valley, 
71-56, sending the Pioneers to their first league defeat since 1986. The 
victory moved Westlake (10-6, 3-1) into a second-place tie with Simi Valley 
(11-6, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
After Simi Valley grabbed a 12-10 first-quarter lead, Schwan, held scoreless in 
the first 8 minutes, scored 10 points to help Westlake take a 31-26 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake continued to set the pace in the third quarter as Schwan and forward 
Mike Waggoner each scored 6 points to help open a 49-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley looked finished when Westlake assumed a 54-35 lead early in the 
fourth quarter, but the Pioneers showed their first signs of life after a 
timeout and battled back on the strength of a full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers outscored the Warriors, 12-1, to cut Westlake's lead to 55-47 with 
3:30 left, but the Warriors made 10 of 12 free throws to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw seemed to take the loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually all things must come to an end," he said. "We would have liked to 
remain undefeated, but we are still in control in league play." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carnes paced Simi Valley with 17 points and Mike Wawryk came off the 
bench to add 10 points and grab 6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Coffey scored 16 points and Peter Mladina added 12 for Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Hess credited the win to team preparation and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our psycho 'D' that made us successful tonight," he said. "The guys 
were prepared and we did what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The win was Westlake's fourth in 17 games against Simi Valley.

THOMAS SETS THE PACE AS TAFT TOPS CHATSWORTH FOR 8TH WIN IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taft High won its eighth consecutive boys' basketball game Friday night but the 
Toreadors more closely resembled a plow horse than a racehorse. After Taft 
plodded past Chatsworth, 50-37, in a Northwest Valley Conference contest, Taft 
Coach Jim Woodard was almost apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I tell you," Woodard said. "We won ugly. There's no other way to put 
it. We play an ugly brand of basketball. We just don't have the quickness or 
team speed like last year." 
</P>
<P>
With 3 starters -- including three-time state sprint champion Quincy Watts -- 
lost to graduation, the Toreadors are no longer an attacking offensive team 
with a stable of thoroughbreds. Rather, Taft frequently walks the ball up the 
court before employing a set offense. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (13-1, 3-0 in league play) does, however, possess one of the premier point 
guards in the City Section: senior Dedan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sensational," Woodard said. "He can do it all." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who had 20 points, 8 assists and 5 steals, nearly did it all for Taft 
in the first quarter, hitting all 4 of his shots as the Toreadors took a 10-9 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Taft scored the first 7 points of the second half to take command of the game. 
A basket by Jason Deyoe (10 points, 11 rebounds) gave Taft a 32-21 lead with 
4:05 left in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think it was our defense that caused their bad shooting," Woodard 
said. "Whatever it was, they didn't score many points in the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors scored a paltry 4 points in the period, hitting 1 of 7 
field-goal attempts. They converted only 25% (11 of 44) of their shots in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taft was feeling fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good tonight," said Thomas, who has signed a letter of intent 
with Nevada Las Vegas. "I think we played well. We seem to be getting better 
with each game." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (8-6, 0-3) took a 12-10 lead early in the second quarter, but Taft 
countered with a pair of Tony Middleton free throws, a 3-point shot by Brooklyn 
McLinn from the right corner and a layup by Thomas off a rare fast break to 
take a 17-12 advantage with 5:30 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas hit another basket and assisted on 3 others before the half ended with 
the Toreadors holding a 25-21 lead. Rick Garrick continued to struggle for 
Chatsworth, scoring 6 points on 2-of-15 shooting. Dominic DeSantis added 14 
points.

BIOLA STANDS TALL IN CUTTING OCCIDENTAL DOWN TO SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental College Coach Brian Newhall has harped on his basketball team all 
season about honing the fundamentals of the game -- like eliminating such 
shortcomings as excessive turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But while Newhall might have some control over his team's grasp of the basics, 
there was nothing he could do about the problems they faced Friday at Biola. 
</P>
<P>
Biola turned out a front line of 6-foot, 6-inch forward Kevin Hood, 6-7 forward 
Paul Horn and 6-9 center Ed Johansen -- all transfers from Division I programs 
-- to dwarf Occidental and help the Eagles post their eighth consecutive 
victory, an 88-77 nonconference decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first team that was bigger and stronger than we were," 
Occidental's John Keister said. "Usually I just release and (center) Chris 
Anderson gets the ball." 
</P>
<P>
But Keister, a 6-5 forward, and Anderson, a 6-10 center, did not go quietly. 
Keister scored a game-high 25 points and Anderson added 20. But 6-2 Brett 
Dennis, Occidental's other forward, was held to just 4 points while Biola 
outrebounded the Tigers, 37-23. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Biola cashed in on the height advantage at the one place where size 
doesn't matter: the free-throw line. Because the Eagles passed inside on nearly 
every possession, Occidental defenders were forced to foul. And Biola made the 
most of its opportunities, converting 30 of 40 free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Hood, a 1987 All-Big Sky selection at Montana who transferred to Biola last 
semester, presented big problems for Occidental. He scored 20 points and 
grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds. Johansen, who transferred from UC Irvine last 
semester, finished with 15 points and Horn, who transferred from Mississippi, 
had 19. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hood was dissatisfied with his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," he said. "We should have blown them out. There isn't a team 
in this district that can face a team like us." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who built a 5-point halftime lead, began to pull away about 10 
minutes into the second half. Horn and Brandel Studevan combined for 6 free 
throws and Studevan buried a 15-foot shot from the baseline to increase the 
lead to 13, 62-49. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 12, 75-63, Occidental (10-3) embarked on a 14-6 run with about 3 
minutes to play. The surge was sparked by Jason Greenstein's 3-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
But Occidental was forced to foul down the stretch and Biola proved deadly at 
the line and cut short the Tigers' belated comeback.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Agoura High girls' soccer team set a Southern Section record Friday with 
its 30th consecutive win as the Chargers crushed Calabasas, 9-0, in a Frontier 
League match at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (15-0, 3-0 in league play), the Southern Section 2-A Division champion 
the past 3 years, has not been held to a tie since the middle of last season 
and is unbeaten in 66 consecutive matches. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Walters and Vanessa Martin each scored 2 goals to lead Friday's assault. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS 
</P>
<P>
Agoura 4, Calabasas 0 -- The Chargers, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 1-A 
Division, scored 3 second-half goals to break open a close Frontier League 
match at Agoura. The win was Agoura's 11th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Four players -- Dominic Zapata, Eric Pratts, Matt Freedman and Tim Ward -- 
scored for the Chargers (12-2-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 3, Bell-Jeff 1 -- Goals by Brady Mitchell, Jorge Chavez and Greg 
Baumgartner lifted the Eagles in a San Fernando Valley League match. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 3, Camarillo 1 -- Brian Weaver scored 2 first-half goals as the 
host Pioneers (16-2, 4-0) remained undefeated in Marmonte League play. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 2, La Salle 0 -- Alex Woodhead scored 28 seconds into the San Fernando 
Valley League match and Marty Holly added a first-half goal as the Saracens 
improved to 6-7, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 1, Royal 0 -- The Raiders scored 26 minutes into the Marmonte 
League match at Channel Islands and prevailed despite being outshot, 20-4. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 1, Muir 1 -- Rich Schwein scored with 15 minutes to play, allowing Muir 
(5-0-1) to remain unbeaten in the Foothill League.

CS NORTHRIDGE, CLIPPERS MEETING DELAYED

<TEXT>
<P>
A meeting scheduled for Friday between Cal State Northridge administrators and 
officials from the Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball team has been 
postponed until later this month, said Eliott Minninberg, a CSUN administrative 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Minninberg cited a conflict of schedules for the change of plans. On the agenda 
were informal talks regarding the Clippers' use of an arena that has been 
proposed for construction on the Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a group of Anaheim businessmen announced that they had offered 
Clipper owner Donald Sterling $30 million to move the team to Anaheim as soon 
as a 20,000-seat arena is completed. MIKE HISERMAN

WAGNER ARRIVES AT NEBRASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darrin Wagner, who quit the San Diego State football team in November, has 
arrived at the University of Nebraska with intention of enrolling for spring 
semester, Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said Wagner arrived Thursday and has been granted a "provisional 
admittance" to the university based on his high school academic record. 
</P>
<P>
"Until he arrived Thursday, I thought maybe Darrin would decide to remain at 
San Diego State," Osborne said. "But Darrin and his family feel very strongly 
about him coming to Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne repeated his statement made this week that Wagner would not be given a 
scholarship but was welcome as a walk-on. Osborne said that depending on his 
athletic and academic progress, Wagner could earn a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, Wagner will not be eligible to 
play for Nebraska until the 1990 season and will have 3 seasons of football 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, The Times' 1987 San Diego County back of the year for Lincoln High 
School, did not play in a game for SDSU as a freshman.

Here's a basketball tip: A team is in trouble when its 6-foot 7-inch center is 
shooting 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly where John Pressler, Helix's center, stood late in a 
Grossmont League 3-A game with Monte Vista Friday night at Helix. 
</P>
<P>
By that time it was too late for the Highlanders, who were easily handled by 
Monte Vista, 64-48. 
</P>
<P>
The game featured the league's two undefeated teams and two biggest big men. 
Monte Vista (8-4, 4-0) had 6-8 center Joe McNaull, while Helix (9-5, 3-1) 
countered with Pressler. 
</P>
<P>
But Monte Vista took advantage of a superior perimeter game and sagging 
defense. The Monarchs spread a 27-18 halftime lead to 49-26 by the end of the 
third quarter and were never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Helix spent three quarters on the outside looking in, and always for Pressler, 
who had a game-high 20 points plus 15 rebounds and 2 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
But with McNaull playing behind him and two or three others sagging, Monte 
Vista forced Helix to take the outside shot. And Helix could not respond until 
Monte Vista had the game well in hand, 59-31, with 5:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
"What I wanted to do was not jump when he pump-faked," said McNaull, who had 11 
points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks. "I read where he fouled out some guy by 
pump-faking. I just wanted to get him in foul trouble as early as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Pressler's frustration with Monte Vista's defense showed when he tried to elbow 
past McNaull and drew his third foul with 2:57 left in the third quarter. 
Pressler was called for his fourth personal 19 seconds later while trying to 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Polinsky led Monte Vista with 19 points and Curt Howard added 11.

FUGARD'S 'ROAD TO MECCA' A WELL-FASHIONED PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drama doesn't need to shout. A quiet "How do you take your tea?" can be a 
declaration of war, as in Athol Fugard's "The Road to Mecca," at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Elsa (Christine Healy) is pouring -- "being Mother" at the request of her older 
friend Helen (Nan Martin), who has been having some trouble with her hands. 
</P>
<P>
They are sitting in Helen's living room, entertaining Marius, Helen's pastor 
(Alan Mandell), who has just dropped by with some fresh vegetables from his 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Marius also has a paper that he would like Helen to sign -- if convenient. It 
would allow her to enter the old people's home, as they have been discussing. 
Not that there is any hurry about this. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, seeing that Helen has a guest, perhaps Marius should return tomorrow. 
He doesn't want to intrude. 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, says Helen's young friend from the city, who thinks she knows 
exactly what the pastor's game is. How do you take your tea? 
</P>
<P>
This is an old-fashioned play. People keep their voices civil and do not 
necessarily speak their minds, although it is clear that they have minds. 
</P>
<P>
When the time does come to say something, however, it will be said in full. 
Perhaps a little too much in full. It's never "Now listen" in "The Road to 
Mecca." It's always "Now listen to me, Helen. Listen to me very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
This is characteristic of Fugard's dialogue and can make for heavy watching. It 
takes fine actors to present Fugard's characters not as stuffy creatures but as 
serious people, people who would rather be considered tedious than superficial. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Benson's cast has caught the honor and gravity of Fugard's characters 
without being prolix. Nan Martin manages this by making Helen a woman who must 
fight to keep her body and her mind under control. In her old age, the tendency 
-- the temptation -- is for her to be scattered and manic, her state at the 
start of the play. 
</P>
<P>
"My hands will keep me sane," Helen says at one point. (She is an artist -- or 
was.) But those hands must now be monitored, and this calls for will power. 
Helen's journey in the play is toward wholeness and calm, and Martin 
accomplishes it beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
Mandell takes a different approach to Pastor Marius than Fugard did when he 
played the role Off Broadway last season. Marius is not to be seen as a 
conscious hypocrite -- that's what's interesting about him -- but Fugard made 
him a very stiff-backed sort of saint. 
</P>
<P>
Mandell makes him humbler and more appealing, a man who didn't enter the 
ministry in order to control people but in order to help them. His principles 
never waver, but he understands the human equation, and his capitulation at the 
end has real grace and real pain. 
</P>
<P>
Healy has the toughest acting job. Helen's young friend is given more than one 
chance to report on her problems, but doesn't actually get a chance to 
demonstrate them. There are moments when one suspects that she's been given 
those problems to bring her into emotional parity with the other two 
characters. Healy banishes these doubts -- or almost -- with a superb cry for 
help in the last act. 
</P>
<P>
If Fugard meant "Mecca" as a harrowing play, it isn't. But it's a searching 
one, a thoughtful examination of matters that, in De Maupassant's phrase, "do 
not occur to the young." Interesting, then, that a young person leaving the 
theater said that she loved the play because so much of it applied to her life. 
</P>
<P>
It's typical of the evening that we don't get to see Helen's garden sculptures, 
the ones that have made her suspect in the community. All we see is her 
eccentric living room (designed by Michael Devine), and not until the candles 
are lit do we see it as its own sculpture. Drama doesn't need to shout. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., with Saturday and 
Sunday matinees at 2:30 p.m. Closes Feb. 16. Tickets $19-$26. 655 Town Center

POP BEAT: SAHM EXPOSES HIS ROOTS AT PALOMINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than three decades of bounding back and forth across musical 
borders, Doug Sahm is a master at meshing his musical roots. 
</P>
<P>
So when he jumped from the stone groove of Southern blues to the stoned-hippie 
grooviness of his 1969 hit "Mendocino" to the earthy Mexican conjunto music of 
his native San Antonio during his two-hour set Thursday night at the Palomino 
Club, it seemed completely natural. 
</P>
<P>
Topping a bill of Texas rhythm and blues acts put together by Austin's famed 
Antone's club and record label, Sahm showed that he not only knows these styles 
but feels them as well as anyone who works in the genres. And that includes the 
likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Los Lobos (whose 
Cesar Rosas joined Sahm for one conjunto number). 
</P>
<P>
A little "T-Bone Shuffle"? Sahm just cranks up his horn section and boogies on 
down. Some nuevo wavo norteno? Set the organ in the "cheesy Farfisa" mode and 
revive the '60s pop Sir Douglas Quintet moniker. A stroll in the streets of the 
barrio? Bring on button accordionist Flaco Jimenez (and sweet-voiced 
actor/singer Harry Dean Stanton) and break out the Coronas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that accomplishment and spirit, the evening held but one lone 
epiphany: "She's About a Mover," the old Quintet's 1965 Top 20 hit. Of course, 
back then it was just another frat-party fave. But today, in the light of all 
we have learned about rock's roots, the song revealed itself as an unlikely but 
delightful blend of Tex-Mex, R&amp;B, rock and Mersey beat. (Remember, the old 
group's name was even intended to pass it off as British!) 
</P>
<P>
That hardly makes the song a Hall of Fame candidate, but even in its throwaway 
novelty, it served to showcase Sahm's musical vision. In that light, it seemed 
unfortunate that Sahm segregated his tastes for the rest of the evening -- no 
matter how good he and his versatile band were with the blues (featured on 
Sahm's upcoming "Jukebox Music" LP) or norteno. 
</P>
<P>
The same flaw existed with the evening's two other acts, who tended more toward 
the mechanical side of the R&amp;B genre rather than transcending that to what 
we would call soul. Still, second-billed singer Angela Strehli is a remarkable 
talent -- possessing a husky, powerful voice, but also having the restraint and 
taste to use it with subtlety and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of just belting it out like so many others, Strehli delivers the lines 
with an arid sense of understatement that lends some bite to these blues. But 
only the imaginative guitar work of Dean Freeman (who looks more like British 
television educator James Burke than a Texas bluesman) kept the arrangements of 
mostly familiar blues songs from being routine. 
</P>
<P>
Opening act Mel Brown, a veteran Texas blues guitarist, and his band, the 
Silent Partners, also showed a lot of solid talent but little vision. Still, 
there was plenty going on throughout the show to keep the crowd (including more 
than a few truckloads worth of homesick Texans) movin' and groovin' well into 
the a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The same bill will be appearing at the Music Machine on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Hothouse Flowers' show, originally scheduled for Feb. 17 at the 
Coach House, has been changed to Feb. 16. Tickets for the original date will be 
honored. The Flowers will also be at the Ventura Theatre on Feb. 18. . . . 
Tickets are on sale now for Colin James at Bogart's on Feb. 6 and the Roxy on 
Feb. 7, and for David Grisman at the Wadsworth Theater on Feb. 10. . . . Also 
coming to the Roxy: Thelonious Monster on Jan. 22 and the Dead Milkmen on Feb. 
13. The Dead Milkmen will also be at Bogart's on Feb. 11. . . . The B.H. 
Surfers will be at UCLA's Ackerman Ballroom on Feb. 3. . . . The Circle Jerks

DOES BLACK REALITY STILL GO TO THE BACK OF HOLLYWOOD'S BUS?;

<P>
'UNCONQUERED' DEPICTS PLIGHT OF SOUTHERN WHITE LIBERALS DURING CIVIL RIGHTS 
STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
The burnings, the lynchings, the shootings, the knifings, the beatings, the 
cursings. The screaming, the harassing, the abusing, the hating. The threats, 
the taunts, the all-out terror in the South. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was a terrible time for white liberals. 
</P>
<P>
"Unconquered" is the "fact-based" story of Richmond Flowers Jr., a white 
Alabaman who overcame prejudice against blacks to become a high school track 
star and a football star at the University of Tennessee. And you thought Martin 
Luther King Jr. had it bad. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 9 p.m. Sunday on CBS Channels 2 and 8, the closeness of "Unconquered" 
to King's birthday Monday is unfortunate, to say the least. More than even the 
theatrical movies "Cry Freedom" and "Mississippi Burning," here is a classic 
case of the black experience filtered through surrogate white eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks? Don't be such a stickler. Just because it's their suffering doesn't 
mean they have to be in it much. Besides, white suffering in their behalf sells 
better in the view of industry decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
We open in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. Despite having bad asthma and a foot 
problem severe enough for him to wear corrective shoes, Richmond Jr. is 
determined to play football. An even greater liability for young Richmond is 
Richmond Sr., a state senator whose friendliness with King and backing of black 
causes has earned him the tag of "nigger lover." 
</P>
<P>
Now it's 1964. Richmond Jr. (Dermot Mulroney) has been cut from the high school 
football team, but he makes the track team and acquires a best pal in Arnie 
Woods (Frank Whaley) and a girlfriend in Jenny Robertson (Cindy Shiver). And 
Richmond Sr. (Peter Coyote) has acquired a new, even more visible job as state 
attorney general. Meanwhile, in a bit of emphasis that seems somewhat 
misplaced, there's a back story. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
As in back-of-the-bus story. So far back that at one point, the murder of civil 
rights worker Viola Liuzzo becomes a sort of video sidelight to one of Richmond 
Jr.'s track meets. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing all athletes whose stories are told on TV, Richmond Jr. overcomes 
adversity. This includes the wrath of white racists responding to the liberal 
views of his father, who becomes "the most hated white man in Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
A cross is burned on the front lawn. A brick crashes through the window. There 
are clashes with redneck classmates who are jealous of Richmond Jr.'s athletic 
success and angered by the integrationist views he shares with Arnie and Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond Jr. makes things even worse by rescuing a black child from humiliation 
by white racists (then lecturing the boy on having more self-esteem). 
</P>
<P>
King occasionally shows up to serve the plot, and dollops of civil rights 
activity are applied for the sake of atmosphere. By now, however, the suffering 
of Flowers' family and friends looms big, much, Much, MUCH bigger even than the 
suffering of the blacks whose rights they support. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the murder of King becomes merely a 5-second footnote -- handled by a 
phone call -- to the fuzzily explained legal problems of Richmond Sr. He is 
sent to prison after being convicted of "conspiring to exact payments illegally 
from persons and firms doing business in Alabama." The implication is that he 
was framed by powerful forces offended by his liberal views. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richmond Jr. gets a measure of revenge by scoring the winning 
touchdown for Tennessee against the University of Alabama. Yes, those 
segregationists can't conquer him . . . or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Just whose story is this anyway? Producer/director Dick Lowry and scriptwriter 
Pat Conroy seem unsure themselves, judging by their lack of focus. They surely 
offer nothing on the screen to justify the attention given to Richmond Jr., who 
does indeed seem like a swell and gutsy guy with many fine attributes, but 
whose plight hardly mattered compared with that of blacks trapped in the vice 
of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
What obviously did matter, as this project passed through various stages of 
development, was that the hero was white. If Richmond Flowers Jr. were black, 
there would be no "Unconquered."

FACT-BASED DRAMA TRIGGERS QUESTION OF PERSPECTIVE IN TELLING CIVIL RIGHTS STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early on in "Unconquered," the CBS-TV movie airing Sunday at 9 p.m., Martin 
Luther King Jr. is talking to Alabama State Sen. Richmond Flowers Sr. about the 
Montgomery bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
There is a degree of respect, if not cordiality, between the black preacher and 
the white politician. Flowers tells King that if the boycott succeeds, the city 
will change. "We pull off the boycott, senator, the world will never be the 
same," replies King. 
</P>
<P>
And then the story, which starts in 1955 and spans about a dozen years and 2 
1/2 TV hours, switches back to Richmond Flowers Sr. and to his son Richmond 
Flowers Jr., who are white. 
</P>
<P>
"Unconquered" is the most recent in a series of highly visible fact-based 
dramas set in the midst of the struggle of blacks for civil rights. Like the 
feature films "Mississippi Burning" and "Cry Freedom," the TV movie has raised 
the issue of how blacks fit into dramatizations of that struggle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 film "Cry Freedom," the story of South African black nationalist 
leader Steven Biko is secondary to that of white anti-apartheid editor Donald 
Woods. In "Mississippi Burning," which goes into wide national release this 
weekend, the movie begins with the assassination of three civil rights workers, 
then becomes a story about two fictional FBI men who track down their killers. 
Now, with "Unconquered," some are critical of still another production that 
looks at that turbulent era through the eyes of whites -- especially on the eve 
of King's birthday anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In "Unconquered," Richmond Flowers Sr. goes on to become state attorney 
general, an antagonist of Gov. George Wallace and, as the actual stories of the 
time noted, a "lonely voice of moderation in Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
A small delicate child with asthma who is forced to wear bulky corrective shoes 
that are anathema to him, Richmond Jr. is determined to play football and, with 
"Chariots of Fire"-like music in the background, goes on to become not only a 
football player but also a high-hurdles champion in college. 
</P>
<P>
King appears in three more scenes in the movie -- and one time, off camera, 
giving a speech toward the end of the Selma marches about putting an end to 
segregation while a montage of scenes including Flowers Jr. running with a 
black athlete appears on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rosa Parks, the 42-year-old seamstress who began the boycott when 
she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montogomery bus, is neither 
specifically depicted nor mentioned. That boycott marked the birth of the civil 
rights movement 
</P>
<P>
"The genesis of the project was totally separate and apart from that," noted 
Norman Powell, vice president of CBS entertainment productions. "We had no idea 
we could make a deal. It just became an opportunity . . . After I showed it to 
management, they saw (King's birthday) as a target of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the focus on whites, Powell said CBS thought there was "a great point 
of view on that story from the journey of the Richmond Flowers family which was 
really unique. A major character is Martin Luther King. I think what we did was 
take a unique story of two people (Flowers father and son) whose courage and 
commitment during a time which was terribly unpopular . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the network would ever do a movie about Rosa Parks, Powell 
replied: "Presumably so, certainly." 
</P>
<P>
"There are white stories and black stories," he noted, "and a lot of people who 
make enormous sacrifices and exhibit great courage. What we did was we found a 
story so compelling we wanted to go ahead and make it. It happened to be white. 
It wasn't a conscious decision not to do a black film, but a decision to do a 
film that illuminated the context of our time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a choice," Powell added. "We didn't have a black story and a 
white story. We had a story we just found so compelling we wanted to tell it." 
</P>
<P>
CBS has done a number of shows with a black main character, he said. The one 
that immediately came to mind for Powell was the story of Marva Collins, a 
black Chicago schoolteacher and the difficulties she faced. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Edwards, president of the NAACP's Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter and 
executive producer of the Image Awards for individuals in movies, TV and 
recording that portray a positive image of blacks, asserted that "what is 
happening in the entertainment industry is called economic racism. There aren't 
black producers, directors and writers being able to get in the door to pitch 
their products so our story being told by us will never get told. It will 
always be from a white perspective. 
</P>
<P>
" 'A mind is a terrible thing to waste,' and that's what's happening in the 
entertainment industry. There are no black executives to make decisions to 
allow other blacks to come in the door. . . . 
</P>
<P>
He noted as an exception the airing tonight at 11:30 p.m. on NBC-TV a tape of 
the Image Awards. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Mississippi Burning' was very misleading," added Edwards, joining a chorus 
of protest from both blacks and whites about what they consider second-class 
treatment of blacks. "It's like nobody black really did anything. Everybody 
white was the hero, and (it looks as if) we had no heroes at all." 
</P>
<P>
"Unconquered," Edwards noted, is about a white family "but why have they not 
told the story of black families within the context of the civil rights 
movement? Even (the story of slain civil rights leader) Medgar Evers could not 
get on national TV. Only PBS aired 'For Us the Living,' which his wife Myrlie 
Evers tried to get on ABC, CBS and NBC. Look at Rosa Parks. Why has no one done 
a story about this woman who single-handedly started a revolution in America?" 
</P>
<P>
Zev Braun, executive producer of CBS' "Tour of Duty" said he was so outraged by 
the point of view of "Mississippi Burning" that he immediately resolved to 
create a television movie or miniseries that looks at the civil rights movement 
from a black perspective. Several days ago, Braun began discussions with Myrlie 
Evers about doing Medgar Evers' story, as well as how she carried on as an 
activist following his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Mississippi Burning' was such a well-done movie, (but) I said, wait a minute 
-- the civil rights movement was not about these little Bobby Kennedy clones, 
these FBI guys, who ran around winning the civil rights movement for black 
folks," Braun said. "After seeing that movie, I've determined that I'm going to 
do the story right. To take away the civil rights movement from blacks is like 
taking the Holocaust away from Jews." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Lowry, "Unconquered" producer and director, noted that originally the work 
had started out as a feature-length movie, but no one would buy it. "The movie 
did not come about as a civil rights movie," said Lowry, "but about an 
extremely interesting family who had experienced very unique physical, social 
and political pressures that did play out against the background of the civil 
rights movement . . . The absolute genesis of the story was an article 
inpublished in Sports Illustrated, 'The Winning Son of a Dedicated Loser' 
(1966). 
</P>
<P>
"This is about a very unique family, where 'Mississippi Burning' is totally a 
civil rights movie," Lowry added. "I'm a big ("Mississippi Burning" director) 
Alan Parker fan, but I'm a little more pleased, comfortable with the way we 
dealt with civil rights than the way they did. I'll be very blunt with you -- I 
would not be as comfortable taking a story whose genesis was so steeped in a 
specific real-life incident and fictionalizing it to the degree done in that 
movie. But I'll defend the film makers' right to do that to the very end." 
</P>
<P>
Yet specific facts are loosely played with in "Unconquered." The tragedy of 
four young girls killed in a Birmingham church when it was firebombed in 1963 
is treated as a brief scene in the TV movie -- but in "Unconquered" three girls 
die. 
</P>
<P>
More dramatically, Richmond Flowers Sr. never visited King in the Birmingham 
jail -- although Flowers' insistence that King not be harmed is accurate -- nor 
could King have paid a return visit after Flowers was convicted of extortion 
conspiracy charges. However, Flowers Sr., now practicing "a little law" in 
Dothan, Ala., said they did have several conversations about racism. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers, who served 18 months in federal prison, began his sentence in 1972, 
four years after King's assassination. Flowers, who always maintained he was 
framed because of his views, was later pardoned by former President Jimmy 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in "Unconquered," there is King visiting Flowers in jail; on the radio in 
the background President Lyndon Johnson announces that he will not run for 
another term. Johnson gave that speech on March 31, 1968. Four days later in 
Memphis, King was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things are degrees of gray," Lowry maintained. "We took a real 
conversation between Martin Luther King and Richmond Flowers and changed its 
physical location. We didn't fictionalize conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Coyote, who portrays Flowers Sr., said he is "shocked by the myopia of 
the press. They are concentrating exclusively on chronology where this is a 
story about the human spirit. It is a made artifact, and to make it the artist 
employs legitimate, fictional devices of compression, substitution, emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
Coyote, who was former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown, Jr.'s cultural adviser for 
eight years and a chairman of the California Arts Council, places himself on 
both sides of the controversy about the role of blacks in civil rights dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it any surprise to anyone that we live in a racist country?" he began 
carefully, dictating his response down to the punctuation. "That's one part of 
the equation. The other part is demographic. Whoever put up the capital to make 
('Unconquered') is trying to maximize the return by maximizing the audience. 
And I suppose with that kind of thinking, they make a crude assumption that 
blacks are 12% of the population and that whites won't be interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a stupid assumption," Coyote added, "but anyone who thinks it 
isn't being made is being disingenuous. Doesn't it tell you something that the 
mass media have waited 20-something years to tell this story at all? Just as we 
did with Vietnam. Do you really think that people who put up the money don't 
have inner clocks that tell them when the subject matter is sufficiently 
distanced to be safe? 
</P>
<P>
"However, you might ask yourself," Coyote continued, "if these fears and 
assertions were correct, why did 'Color Purple' make so much money, and why do 
Toni Morrison's and James Baldwin's and Alex Haley's books and (the TV show) 
'Roots' make so much money?" 
</P>
<P>
"I also think that it's legitimate for an artist to tell the story the way he 
wants to tell it. And I don't think (writer) Pat Conroy's decision to focus on 
a white family is an illegitimate decision . . . I have no more patience with 
liberal propaganda and bullying of an artist than I do with conservative 
(propaganda), and in this day and age, with blatant manipulation by all sides, 
I think the artist is the last bastion of integrity and sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Diane Haithman also contributed to this story.

LARRY RILEY -- WELL-SEASONED PERFORMER FOR ALL MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ask me a question, and I've got a story for you." 
</P>
<P>
From Larry Riley, that's an offer he can back up. He has built up a few 
trunkloads of tales from his years crossing back and forth between theater and 
film and television, even though he is only 37. Riley is definitive proof that 
only a few years as an actor, traversing the media like a soldier-for-hire 
working for numerous clients, can season you quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Riley if it's a matter of good timing that the same night he's opening as 
performer and producer in Martin Jones' play "West Memphis Mojo" at the 
Ensemble Studio Theatre Sunday -- Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth date -- he's 
also playing King in the CBS-TV movie, "Unconquered" (9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
"We planned (the play) for Martin's birth," he replied. "And I know that the 
producers wanted 'Unconquered' to air at that time." Then, rapid-fire, he 
added: "Do you want to hear a story?" 
</P>
<P>
Riley was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there (in Memphis) the day King was shot. And I don't mean I was in the 
same town. I mean I was outside the Lorraine Motel, waiting for him when he was 
shot. I was part of a youth effort (he was 17 at the time) for the sanitation 
workers' strike that Martin was there to support." 
</P>
<P>
Riley had grown up in the Memphis neighborhood known as Orange Mound (for the 
orange trees growing on the land of a former plantation and the nearby Indian 
burial mounds). The area in and around Memphis -- the city itself, the deeply 
rural Mississippi borderlands to the south, and the mostly black West Memphis, 
where Jones' play is set in 1955 -- is "like a reduced version of the South. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin didn't have to come there, and what I remember, even more than the 
horrible shock of those days, was how I got to know Martin, Ralph Abernathy and 
Jesse Jackson as human beings quite different from their media images." 
</P>
<P>
Which was why Riley had passed on previous offers to play King in TV projects 
("Producers wanted to sell King as a personality, not his message"). 
"Unconquered" creator Dick Lowry convinced him otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Television is being good to Riley right now. He believes his "Knots Landing" 
role as a middle-class husband transcends black cultural stereotypes. Still, 
he's pushing himself back into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Theater is what lifted me up," he smiled, "and let me find out about every 
facet of my personality. I've been singing since I could cry. I acted in 
college (Memphis State and Washington's American University). I studied with 
Memphis' Ballet South. There were more sides to me than I could express in any 
one place." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief stint at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Riley's first school of hard 
knocks was the Windy City's Free Street Theatre, which toured Midwestern cities 
and shopping malls, "sometimes 30 cities a month. We traveled in a caravan, set 
up, did a warm-up show, a puppet show, a dance, comedy, the main show, and a 
wrap-up show. You became a jack-of-all-trades, and fast." 
</P>
<P>
The other invaluable benefit of Free Street was working with another legend, 
dancer Wilbur Bradley, one of Lena Horne's men in "Stormy Weather," still 
active and a Midwest theater legend. 
</P>
<P>
"When Michael Peters (who is directing 'Mojo' and who co-choreographed 
'Dreamgirls' with Michael Bennett) asked me during 'Dreamgirls' auditions if I 
had done any dancing. I said: 'Wilbur Bradley.' He answered: 'That's all I need 
to know. Show me your stuff.' " Riley did and got the job. 
</P>
<P>
The dual assignment in "West Memphis Mojo" of playing Frank, a hip, world-wise 
R&amp;B guitarist (with some on-stage riffing), and the show's producer is a 
fulfillment, Riley thinks, of training. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm one of those people who's trying to figure out a way to have a phone 
surgically implanted in my arm," he said, almost casually adding that 
rehearsing "Mojo" at night and performing in "Knots Landing" during the day, 
while preparing a musical version of the life of the R&amp;B hit maker Louis 
Jordan ("not (French performer) Louis Jourdan") is easy. 
</P>
<P>
If this is easy, what is hard? 
</P>
<P>
"Try early-morning tapings of 'The Doctors,' rehearsing Randy Newman's revue 
'Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong' in the afternoon, and being in 'A Soldier's Play' at 
the Negro Ensemble Company at night. That was about five years ago in New York. 
That's hard. 
</P>
<P>
"But I love juggling balls. I wouldn't do it for any play, though," he said, 
explaining that since 1984, "Mojo" has been a kind of Holy Grail for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about how black artists got ripped off, and ripped each other off, but at 
bottom, it's about male bonding." Riley was one of the script's early 
enthusiasts, "but (TV) jobs just kept coming and coming. As much as I wanted to 
do the play, I feel now -- and it's not a feeling I like -- that I strayed away 
from the stage."

24-HOUR L.A.: THE NIGHT OWL'S GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While New York has long been heralded as "the city that doesn't sleep," the Los 
Angeles area has its share of all-night life, too. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may not be bustling with the a.m. overflow of its Eastern 
counterpart, Los Angeles can't be discounted as dead from midnight to 6 a.m. In 
addition to the requisite convenience stores, supermarkets, coffee shops and 
gas stations, there are some unusual spots that are open around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
There are many others, but here are a few of the wide-awake hangouts where 
night owls can be found in the wee hours of morning: 
</P>
<P>
Tennis, anyone? -- Merchant of Tennis, 1118 S. La Cienega Blvd., (213) 
855-1946. If you're in the mood for a Wimbledon tuneup in the wee hours, this 
tennis shop/court complex has available two concrete courts any time -- day or 
night. However, reservations must be made during store hours, which are 
Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Court time 
costs $7 per hour during the week, $10 during the weekend. After dark, it costs 
$1.50 per hour extra for lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Parlor games -- Hollywood Billiards, 5504 Hollywood Blvd., (213) 465-0115. This 
hall, claimed to be Southern California's oldest pool room, stays open 24 hours 
Fridays and Saturdays, and until 2 a.m. Sunday through Thursday. The 
10,000-square-foot structure, built around 1916, once housed the offices of 
Louis B. Mayer. There are 12 pool tables (with more to be installed early in 
the year), six billiard tables and three snooker tables, including one that 
measures 6x12 feet. A parking lot is adjacent to the building. Playing time for 
two players starts at $2.60 per player per hour; when more than two play, 
individual rates decrease. Free instruction is offered on Saturdays and Sundays 
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Newsstands -- World Book and News Co., 1652 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 
465-4352. Insomniacs who like to read may want to peruse the famous block-long 
racks that display some 10,000 magazines, 4,000 paperbacks and several hundred 
newspapers. And if you're looking for the daily paper of any large metropolitan 
center, chances are it's here, as well as newspapers from foreign cities such 
as London, Cairo, Milan and Vancouver. Also open around the clock is the 
Sherman Oaks Newsstand, 14500 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 995-0632. 
</P>
<P>
Health spas -- Nautilus Aerobics Plus, 320 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena, (818)

WINTER WORKOUTS; 
</P>
<P>
GET BACK ON THE FITNESS TRACK THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE WOLPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wasn't it only a couple of weeks ago that you swore off sweets, cut back on 
calories and vowed to exercise an hour every day? By now, you may be regretting 
those New Year's resolutions, and feeling not only out of shape but angry with 
yourself for failing -- once again -- to stick with a fitness routine. 
</P>
<P>
The chilly, rainy days of late December and January are not conducive to 
fitness programs, but there are ways to stay in shape during inclement weather. 
And there are plenty of people out there who understand the problems inherent 
in beginning, or keeping to, an established routine during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
Fitness involves flexibility, strength and endurance. When combined with a 
sound nutrition program, a fitness program will enable you to control your 
weight; regular exercise promotes a sense of well-being, enhances self-esteem 
and can open up a new social network. But before embarking on a regular fitness 
routine, see your doctor or a sports-medicine specialist who can evaluate your 
present level of physical conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Why all the concern over fitness anyway? Noted runner, cardiologist and fitness 
guru Dr. George Sheehan says: "Your whole life depends on it, and by that I 
mean your total life, the person you are: your longevity, your life expectancy, 
your creativity, your success at work, your domestic bliss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Attitude 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything in your life depends on becoming fit." When you look at 
it that way, maybe a fitness program deserves another try -- and a different 
attitude. The prevailing opinion these days is that fitness should be fun. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony Daly, L.A. Clipper team physician, acknowledges: "It really takes 
an effort to begin a fitness program; the motivation has to come from the 
individual. But you have to find something you like doing or you'll find a 
reason to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Personal trainer Jake Steinfeld, host of the "Body by Jake" television show, 
agrees. "You have to keep humor in exercise," he says, "and use your workout as 
a way to relieve stress, pressure and tension. It shouldn't become a source of 
anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
Finding the time to incorporate an exercise routine into an already hectic 
schedule without adding more stress to your life may seem impossible, but 
Barbara Harris, editor-in-chief of Shape magazine, has a few suggestions. "The 
goal is to make fitness a habit that comes as naturally as brushing your 
teeth," she says. "Learn to schedule it in; plan your workouts as a part of 
your day." She acknowledges that especially for working mothers, scheduling 
even one hour to work out can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Be flexible with your time," she suggests. "Hire a baby sitter for an hour 
while you exercise, join a health club with a nursery, or exercise to a 
videotape early in the morning. The key is to make it fun and to make it 
realistically fit into your life style." 
</P>
<P>
It's that life-style aspect of fitness that authorities frequently mention, 
incorporating regular exercise into daily life without becoming obsessive about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Fitness Life Style 
</P>
<P>
Podiatrist Allen Selner notes: "We don't see as much participation in sports 
for sport's sake any more. As yuppies are getting older, sports fanaticism has 
evolved to integrating fitness into a life style. People are realizing they 
don't have to run six marathons a year; they can participate in walkathons, 
family hikes or social bike rides instead." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mild winter weather we enjoy in Southern California, embarking on a 
fitness program -- or even continuing your regular routine -- requires 
determination and perseverance. David Rivas, editor in chief of Men's Fitness 
magazine, says: "This is a difficult time to get fit because the days are 
shorter, the weather is colder and nobody seems to have enough time. It just 
seems easier to bundle up and grow a beard." 
</P>
<P>
If hibernating at home all winter sounds even worse than recommiting to those 
lapsed resolutions, consider your workout options. Getting out of your den may 
take your mind off the weather, improve your outlook and get your body in shape 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Activities 
</P>
<P>
You can thank triathletes -- those long-distance endurance specialists who 
swim, bike and run -- for the new fitness philosophy that working out should 
involve several activities. Most triathletes report fewer injuries than 
single-sport athletes and greater enjoyment of their varied workouts. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to train for a triathlon to enjoy the benefits of cross-training 
(regular participation in more than one sport). Vary your routine: Take an 
aerobics class or work out with weights twice a week, go for a social run or a 
family hike on the weekend, walk a few miles with a friend and ride your 
exercise bike a couple of mornings. Incorporate fitness activities into your 
daily life and begin to think of exercise as a way to get out and play. 
</P>
<P>
The mild winters in Southern California are not nearly as prohibitive as those 
back East, but if you don't like the outdoor chill, you can take advantage of a 
number of winter fitness options: Join a gym or health club, exercise at home 
and learn to dress properly for outdoor winter weather workouts. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs and gyms -- The facilities and resources available in a health 
club far surpass whatever you might reasonably accumulate at home. A range of 
weight machines; a full schedule of aerobics, dance and stretch classes; lap 
swimming, Jacuzzis and saunas, and, increasingly, longer hours, on-staff 
fitness trainers and child-care facilities make health clubs more convenient 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Joining a health club is the best way to start a fitness program," Selner 
says. "It provides a social network of support and encouragement, which is so 
important for beginners. The sociability and improved self-esteem from getting 
in better shape will keep them coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Others acknowledge that clubs can be intimidating. Steinfeld refers to them as 
"metal jungles," and Daly observes: "Too often people join a health club, but 
that's the end of their commitment to fitness." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this all-too-common dilemma, join with a friend who will hold you to 
your commitment. Investigate the club before you join to make sure the 
atmosphere, clientele and facilities are in line with your tastes, and take 
advantage of the services offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out at home -- A new generation of high-tech home-fitness equipment 
includes exercise bikes, treadmills, stair-climbing devices, and rowing, 
cross-country-ski and weight-stack machines. Sales are booming, according to 
Harris. The equipment is beneficial only if you use it. Make sure you like the 
workout it offers before you spend your money. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago, the act of hiring a personal fitness trainer was limited 
to the rich and famous. While it's still a luxury to pay someone to come to 
your home to lead your workout, today more people are finding a way. 
</P>
<P>
"Personal trainers are all the rage," Rivas says. "They make every workout 
count. And there are plenty of business people in Los Angeles who make enough 
to afford the $100-plus a week. They make it a part of their budget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Booming Business 
</P>
<P>
Steinfeld, who began by putting celebrities through their fitness paces, says 
he now motivates a whole range of clients -- and business has never been 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Exercising at home is the best thing, because there are no excuses," he says. 
"You can't say the car broke down, you don't have a blue headband and socks to 
match or you don't look good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Although investing in expensive equipment or hiring a personal trainer may be 
an extravagance for many of us, home exercise need not be a high-priced 
proposition. Morning television offers hours of fitness programming. Exercise 
videos and audiotapes take you through an array of well-paced workouts, and 
several monthly health-and-fitness publications feature simple-to-follow 
exercise how-tos. 
</P>
<P>
To make your home fitness program more fun, exercise with a friend or family 
member, listen to your favorite tunes, watch the news or catch up on your light 
reading while you work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor winter-weather workouts -- Running, cycling and walking require only 
simple clothing modifications for comfortable year-round participation. 
Dressing in layers is sensible and an easy way to accommodate temperature 
changes. If you must run or walk at night, wear a reflective jacket or vest for 
greater visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wischnia, senior editor of Runner's World magazine says: "I think people in 
California tend to overdress when they run in the winter. When you're running 
more than a couple of miles, you tend to heat up." He recommends wearing a 
long-sleeved T-shirt, shorts or running tights and a nylon or Gore-Tex shell 
when it's really cold or wet outside. The former Californian, who now lives -- 
and runs all year -- in Emmaus, Pa., adds: "I never wear outerwear unless it's 
a hat and a pair of gloves. You lose most of your body heat from your head and 
your hands, so you should always keep them warm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Warm and Covered' 
</P>

John Howard, former Olympic cyclist, notes: "I find that it just doesn't pay to 
get cold. It really diminishes my level of enthusiasm for cycling. So I make 
sure to keep my fingers, toes and ears warm and covered. My rides are shorter 
and less intense during the winter." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sun is shining, dress warmly for winter cycling. Howard adds: 
"Remember, when you're riding, you create your own wind-chill factor. The 
faster you go, the colder it gets." 
</P>
<P>
"If you do get cold and wet," Wischnia says, "the best thing to do is get warm 
and dry. You can't catch a cold just from being cold, so take a hot shower or 
sit in a Jacuzzi, then put on some dry clothes, and you'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Still not sure about the value of getting back on the fitness track? Consider, 
then, the further observations of Dr. Sheehan, who states with conviction, 
"Exercise and becoming fit will add years to your life." Enough said. Now go 
out and have fun working out.

Arabs rioted in the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday after Jewish settlers 
began an armed patrol, Israel Radio and Arab reports said. Israeli soldiers 
reportedly killed two Palestinians and wounded 18 in separate clashes. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, assailants believed to be Jewish militants smashed a monument to 
fallen Arab soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers killed a 15-year-old Palestinian during a clash at the 
Dahaisha refugee camp near Bethlehem, doctors said. They said a bullet hit 
Nabil Mohammed abu Laban in the shoulder and then pierced his heart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youths Hurl Stones 
</P>
<P>
An Arab reporter said the youth was shot when dozens of Arab youths hurled 
stones at troops, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, finally, 
live ammunition. Laban died at a Bethlehem hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The army said it was checking the report. Israel Radio confirmed the death and 
said another youth was wounded in the clash. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a 15-year-old Arab died of wounds received in a clash with 
Israeli troops the day before, officials at Mukassed Hospital in Arab East 
Jerusalem said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Mohammed Yaqub Shalhoub was shot in the head during a confrontation 
in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman confirmed the death and said the boy was shot when troops who 
pursued stone-throwers found themselves in a dangerous situation. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Jewish settlers patrolled the streets of Hebron, saying they wanted to 
prevent stone-throwing attacks on their cars, Israel Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Arab youths hurled rocks at the patrol, and the settlers opened fire in the 
air, the radio and Arab reports said. The action sparked a riot by Arabs in the 
city's casbah, a maze of narrow streets serving as an open-air market, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An Arab reporter in the city said dozens of youths who left the main Ibrahim 
Mosque began throwing stones at soldiers, who opened fire with live ammunition, 
wounding a 20-year-old in the stomach and a 22-year-old in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman confirmed the injuries but said he was unaware of the 
settlers' patrol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arab Monument Smashed 
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem, assailants partially smashed a stone monument to soldiers of 
the Arab Legion near the Rockefeller Museum, a police spokesman said. He said 
police had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab Legion was the Jordanian force that tried to prevent the establishment 
of Israel in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller told Israel Army Radio that the monument was damaged by 
"lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
He said the attack was to protest the dismantling by troops two days ago of a 
monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in 
the West Bank. Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killed 
in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek condemned the desecration of the monument. 
</P>
<P>
"Several idiots came from some place in the West Bank to damage the monument," 
Kollek said.

SOVIET RACKETEERS MUSCLE IN ON GROWING NUMBER OF PRIVATE BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Along with shortages, inflation and poor-quality goods, the Soviet Union's 
small but growing number of private businessmen face a new problem: organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the operators of cooperative businesses, which are in the 
hands of groups of individuals rather than the state, have complained of being 
victimized by extortionists demanding protection money. 
</P>
<P>
While crime is not new in the Soviet Union, the recent policy of glasnost, or 
openness, has shed unusual light on the extent of racketeering, suggesting that 
it poses a substantial obstacle for many of the Soviet Union's new 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of cases of racketeering runs into the hundreds," said Anatoly 
Volobuyev, a lawyer at the Ministry of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
"Only one-fifth of the racketeers involved have so far been brought to 
account," Volobuyev told the English-language Moscow News. "As a rule, 
racketeers manage to get what they want just by making threats. But there are 
cases of property being destroyed and of people being beaten up, tortured. 
Sometimes racketeers use weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The cooperatives have been in existence less than two years as part of Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to privatize some segments of the economy 
and increase the availability of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the periodical Literaturnaya Gazeta reported that at least 
two cooperative cafes had been set on fire after receiving extortion threats. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, the Hearth Rug in the Moscow suburb of Viednoya, was burned down 
after the management had repeatedly asked the police for protection, the Moscow 
News said. The other was identified as the Roadside Inn, in central Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bakery Owners Threatened 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the owners of a bakery were threatened with death if they 
failed to pay 50,000 rubles in protection money. The owners managed to borrow 
30,000 rubles, about $50,000 at the official exchange rate, but the gangster 
involved, who was said to have official connections, continued to make demands 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks on cooperatives have found support among the general public. The 
co-ops offer goods and services not available in state shops, but many people 
think their prices are exorbitant and that the entrepreneurs have become 
wealthy almost overnight in a country with few wealthy people. 
</P>
<P>
Thus when the cafe in Viednoya was set on fire, Literaturnaya Gazeta said, 
personnel at a fire station across the road simply looked on. When 
fire-fighting equipment arrived from Moscow, a neighbor shouted jubilantly, "At 
last, they have burned the place." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow News said it was not calling on "everyone to fall in love with the 
cooperative movement," but it demanded that the businesses be protected by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Galkin, a psychologist with the Ministry of the Interior, said, "We 
predict a further increase in racketeering, the sphere of which will expand, 
along with the growth of the cooperatives and the number of self-employed 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
The relative openness of the press has brought forth a spate of increasingly 
lurid articles on organized crime. A recent issue of Ogonyok, a popular 
illustrated magazine modeled on Life, carried a lengthy tribute to the battle 
of one investigator, Vladimir Oleinik, against the Soviet equivalent of the 
Mafia, a word that has found its way into the Russian language. 
</P>
<P>
In Soviet terms, the Mafia represents a class of cunning criminals who have 
enlisted government officials to help them carry out crimes against the 
state-controlled economy. 
</P>
<P>
Also, "the gangsters are forging ties with the operators of the black market," 
Ogonyok reported. In one case, what Ogonyok described as a Mafia-run fur 
factory made off with every other fur, resulting in a huge loss to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The article said a policeman was paid a bribe of 8,000 rubles a month (about 
$13,200), more than two years' salary for the average Soviet policeman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Eliot Ness 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Oleinik, who works for what amounts to the district attorney's 
office, was portrayed as a modern-day Eliot Ness, the federal agent who fought 
the Chicago mob during Prohibition. Oleinik was said to have survived repeated 
assassination attempts, and his wife and son-in-law were fired from their jobs 
because of the Mafia's political influence. 
</P>
<P>
A local Mafia boss was quoted as telling Oleinik in the course of an 
interrogation, "You may be on top now but I will grind you into dust." 
</P>
<P>
In a swipe at the Soviet bureaucracy, the magazine said the figures behind the 
mob are "tremendously clever, gifted people." It said they are many times 
smarter "than their counterparts in the official structure." 
</P>
<P>
"Our tormented country has developed another parasite which is sucking its 
juices," Ogonyok said of the mob.

U.S. FARMER IN COSTA RICA SEIZED IN PROBE

<TEXT>
<P>
John Hull, an American farmer who allegedly used his Costa Rica ranch to assist 
the Nicaraguan Contras, was arrested on suspicion of spying for the CIA and of 
arms and drug smuggling, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hull was picked up at his ranch in the northern province of San Carlos on 
Thursday and taken to San Jose, the capital, for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana native, who has lived in Costa Rica for 20 years, openly supported 
the Contras and has said that, in the past, he let the rebels use his property, 
which stretches along the Nicaraguan border, but denied receiving U.S. support. 
</P>
<P>
However, information uncovered by the Iran-Contra investigation supported the 
allegation that he acted as an arms conduit and worked under orders of the CIA. 
Hull later acknowledged that he did indeed receive thousands of dollars a year 
from the CIA to provide what he called "security," but insisted he had done 
nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican authorities said Friday they began investigating Hull last year 
after a convicted Colombian drug trafficker, George Morales, accused him of 
links with arms and drugs trafficking and of spying for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, serving a 16-year prison term in the United States for drug 
trafficking, told a U.S. Senate committee last April that he had supplied arms 
to the Nicaraguan rebels based in Costa Rica and carried drugs back to the 
United States. He also said that he used landing strips on or adjacent to 
Hull's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
A source in Costa Rica's Office of Judicial Investigations, which is handling 
the case, said authorities had not decided whether to release Hull or send him 
to the prison in San Sebastian pending the outcome of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy refused to confirm or deny the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Hull met with F. Andy Messing, who heads the conservative National 
Defense Foundation in Washington, and California Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) 
during the pair's fact-finding trip to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Messing said Friday that Hull assured them he had stopped assisting the rebels 
when the Iran-Contra case broke.

The driver of a hearse was crushed to death between the dashboard and a coffin

Jack Volkering, 59, of Ft. Wright, was returning from a funeral Mass on 
Wednesday when a car crossed the road and struck the hearse, Police Chief Gene 
Schweitzer said.

The coffin broke through a metal holding post and struck Volkering in the back 
as the dashboard and steering wheel hit him in the chest, said Dr. Fred Stine, 
Campbell County coroner.

Another hearse picked up the body in the coffin immediately after the accident 
and it was buried Thursday as scheduled, a funeral home spokesman said.

THORNBURGH PREDICTS JUSTICES WILL REVERSE ABORTION RULING

<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh predicted Friday that the Supreme Court will 
overrule its landmark decision legalizing abortion this year and turn the issue 
"back to the states." 
</P>
<P>
In a rare comment by the government's top legal officer on a pending court 
case, Thornburgh said in a television interview, to be broadcast today, that it 
was "my guess" that the outcome of a new test case on the issue would be 
abandonment of the 1973 decision that assured women a constitutional right to 
end pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, in a document that Thornburgh approved, had urged 
the Supreme Court to use a case from Missouri as the vehicle for taking a new 
look at the controversy, which could lead to an overruling. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the court put the Missouri case on its docket for the current 
term, indicating that a final ruling is likely before summer, following an 
April hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, in an interview taped for broadcast on the Cable News Network's 
"Evans and Novak" program, cautioned that "anyone who predicts what the court's 
going to do does so at a great deal of risk." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the attorney general went on to make a prediction, saying: "My 
sense would be that if they choose to act -- and that's what we have suggested 
-- that the most likely result would be that they would turn it back to the 
states." 
</P>
<P>
At Senate hearings last year, when he was named attorney general, Thornburgh 
had said he would seek out a case to test the court's willingness to keep the 
1973 decision intact.

REAGAN DERIDES POVERTY AID, ABORTIONS 
</P>

<P>
President Reagan, previewing his post-presidential role as dinner-speaker and 
advocate for conservative causes, on Friday derided federal poverty programs 
and advocated a reversal of the Supreme Court decision allowing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who presided over cuts in social programs benefiting the poor during 
his eight-year tenure, told guests at a white-tie dinner sponsored by the 
Knights of Malta that "too many (poor people) became dependent on government 
payments and lost the moral strength that has always given the poor the 
determination to climb America's ladder of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
On abortion, Reagan predicted that "a new debate will rise in the statehouses 
of our land" over whether to dismantle the 1973 high court decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Highlighted 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's comments on poverty and abortion reflect his long-held views but 
represent his strongest statements on those issues in some time. His comments 
come amid a spate of attention to race and poverty issues -- including the 
Monday birthday celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- and shortly after 
the Supreme Court has agreed to take up the abortion issue again. 
</P>
<P>
The President often has said that, when his tenure ends next Friday and he 
returns to California, he will launch a new career on the "mashed potato 
circuit." He will speak out in this new role on these issues and others, 
including his advocacy of a presidential line-item budget veto and a 
balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"In just seven days I will lay down the mantle of this great office the 
American people have bestowed upon me," Reagan told the dinner guests. "I won't 
leave the battle. As long as there is breath in me, I will fight for the 
principles in which I believe." 
</P>
<P>
While his future speeches will deal with diverse issues, Reagan Friday focused 
on abortion and poverty as he addressed the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic 
group that works to help the sick and the poor around the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Poverty as Victor 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, the government declared a war on poverty," Reagan said. 
"Poverty won." He asserted that "too many poor people were sucked into a system 
that declared that the only sin is not to have enough money." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said a lesson to be learned "is that no war on poverty stands a chance 
unless it rises above the secular state and is guided by the power of love that 
moves through God's word." 
</P>
<P>
The President, a staunch anti-abortionist, said that "protecting the unborn" 
represents a form of serving the powerless. "Our critics call themselves 
pro-choice, but have they ever stopped to think that the unborn never have a 
choice?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue remained contentious throughout Reagan's eight years in 
Washington as he and his conservative colleagues sought to reverse the 1973 
Supreme Court decision, known as Roe vs. Wade. Unable to accomplish this, 
Reagan leaves with a vow to continue the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the "voice of life" will be heard in the debate over the 
abortion law, Reagan said: "The Knights can be a part of that voice. Can I 
count on you?" He received enthusiastic nods and affirmative answers in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it will consider to what extent 
states may restrict a woman's access to abortion, reviewing a federal appellate 
ruling that last year struck down as unconstitutional a Missouri law banning 
any use of public facilities or employees for "performing or assisting" in 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The case is scheduled to be decided by July. In it the justices will consider a 
range of abortion issues, including the assertion that life begins at 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Roe vs. Wade Held 
</P>
<P>
In Roe vs. Wade, the high court struck down on a 7-2 vote all state laws making 
abortion a crime and declared that the Constitution gives women a right to end 
pregnancies in their first three months. 
</P>
<P>
At the dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, the Knights of Malta awarded Reagan its 
highest honor, the Collar of the Order of Merit, "for his vigorous defense of 
the pro-life cause and his strong support of traditional Christian family 
values." Officials said that the award represented the first time in the 
group's 900-year history that it had decorated a U.S. President. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Reagan made "two special requests" of the group, urging that it 
join the "great debate ahead" on abortion and asking "that you help America 
find a way out of the trap of the welfare state."

A group representing more than 80 immigrant organizations in California met 
Friday with U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to urge the creation of a "Bureau 
of Citizenship" that would operate separately from the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to separate the promotion of citizenship from the same agency that 
has a built-in fear for immigrants because it is basically an enforcement 
agency," said John Gamboa, executive director for the Latino Issues Forum. "It 
is incongruent to have these two functions in one organization." 
</P>
<P>
The group also met with aides to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who will review 
the proposal. Spokesmen for Thornburgh said that they are looking into the 
proposal and Gamboa said he hopes to have a response by next month. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said his group presented "brief outlines" of how such a bureau would 
perform its duties differently from the INS, which is a Justice Department 
agency. He said that the proposed new bureau would be modeled after the Census 
Bureau, which operates under the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is natural that (a new bureau) would go under the Education 
Department," he said, adding that a similar bureau in Canada seems to be 
working well. "Canada just recently separated enforcement of immigration and 
promotion of citizenship and they now have a 25% higher naturalization rate" 
than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino Issues Forum, which serves as an umbrella group for many Asian as 
well as Latino immigrant groups, is chaired by former California Supreme Court 
Justice Cruz Reynoso.

The federal Medicare program proposed new regulations Friday that would deny 
payment to hospitals and physicians that deliver substandard hospital inpatient 
care. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations would increase the government's ability "to ensure that 
Medicare beneficiaries receive high-quality care," said Dr. William L. Roper, 
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, peer review organizations, the watchdog groups in each 
state that oversee health care for the elderly and disabled under contract to 
the federal government, would be authorized to deny Medicare payments when 
substandard care harms a patient or unnecessarily places the patient at high 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
Roper said poor quality care might include unnecessarily prolonged treatments 
and complications that require readmission to the hospital or that lead to 
disability or death. 
</P>
<P>
The draft regulations require that patients be notified when payment is denied 
for poor quality care; they also prohibit physicians and hospitals from 
charging patients in such instances. 
</P>
<P>
When the review groups find that care is substandard but does not result in 
harm to the patient, Medicare would pay for the claim but the review group 
would be expected to conduct a follow-up review and work with the physicians 
and hospitals responsible to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations were required by Congress. The health care agency said it 
would issue final regulations after a 60-day comment period.

SAW NO BRUISES ON LISA STEINBERG, WITNESS SAYS

The defense rested Friday in the murder trial of Joel Steinberg, who is accused 
of beating to death his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's 13th and last witness was Joseph Thornton, superintendent of the 
apartment house where Steinberg and his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, 
reared Lisa Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton testified that he had frequently seen Lisa playing with friends, 
walking with Steinberg or riding on Steinberg's shoulders. He said he never saw 
bruises on the child and never saw Steinberg mistreat her. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
After resting his case, defense lawyer Ira London told reporters outside the 
courtroom that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Steinberg, 47, inflicted the injuries that killed Lisa on Nov. 5, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax scheduled the defense summation for 
Thursday. The trial is in its 11th week. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, a psychiatrist said Nussbaum had no need of hospitalization 
for mental care after Lisa's death. 
</P>
<P>
Azarian Eshkenazi testified Thursday that Nussbaum could benefit from 
outpatient psychiatric care, but that in November, 1987, she was oriented and 
coherent with "absolutely no thought disorder." 
</P>
<P>
"I did not find any mental disorder that would require her to be 
psychiatrically hospitalized," said Eshkenazi, head of mental health services 
for women prisoners at Elmhurst Hospital Center. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg's attorneys have claimed that Nussbaum, 46, who has spent the past 
year in a psychiatric facility, is a "malingerer" and a "fraud" who remains 
hospitalized to win sympathy and to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
She had been charged along with Steinberg in the girl's death, but charges were 
dropped and she became the government's chief witness. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends Nussbaum was too battered and emotionally crippled to 
harm Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's trial session, Steinberg continued his court-ordered 
examination by prosecution psychiatrist Martin Brecher, keeping open his 
insanity defense option. The first examination interview Wednesday lasted three 
hours.

'GAY-BASHING' NETS MAXIMUM SENTENCES FOR 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge in Santa Ana handed three young neo-Nazi skinheads the maximum possible 
sentences Friday in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in a Laguna Beach park last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing the three of a "wolf pack" mentality, Superior Court Judge David H. 
Brickner sentenced Aaron F. Compean, 18, who assaulted the victim with a lead 
pipe, to seven years in prison. John M. Moore, 23, received four years and 
eight months for assault and attempted robbery, and Stephen Walther, 18, was 
sentenced to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, all from Huntington Beach, attacked 48-year-old Robert Joyce as 
he walked along the coastal cliffs. But, the jury that convicted them of 
assault charges two months ago rejected prosecutors' contention that the crime 
was attempted murder, which could have carried a 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remorse Claimed 
</P>
<P>
At a sentencing hearing before Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner in Santa 
Ana, defense attorneys said the men were extremely remorseful and asked the 
judge for less than the maximum sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said, however, that he found the crime "especially offensive because 
of its wolf pack modus operandi . . . beating (the victim) seriously for no 
comprehensible reason." 
</P>
<P>
Compean's attorney, Gene E. Dorney, asked the judge to consider that Compean 
was the only one of the three not wearing steel-pointed shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to," Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef said. "He was the one 
with the pipe." 
</P>
<P>
Compean and Walther could have been eligible to serve their sentences at the 
California Youth Authority. Their attorneys said, however, that both wanted to 
go to state prison.

STATE BOARD OKS NEW SCIENCE TEACHING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite objections from Christian fundamentalists, a new science teaching 
policy designed to strengthen classroom instruction about evolution and other 
controversial topics was approved Friday by the state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, approved by unanimous voice vote at a board meeting in 
Sacramento, defines and distinguishes between the teaching of scientific 
theory, such as evolution, and teaching about beliefs, such as Bible-based 
views that man was created in his present form. 
</P>
<P>
Only science, including tested theories that explain natural phenomena and are 
based on evidence, should be taught in science classrooms, the new policy says. 
Discussions of competing beliefs, which are partly matters of faith and not 
subject to scientific testing, should be encouraged in social science courses, 
it adds. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the new policy, including experts in the state Department of 
Education and panels of scientists and educators, say it is part of a larger 
effort to rebuild the quality of science teaching at a time when studies show 
U.S. students are deficient in their understanding of basic scientific 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Anti-Dogmatism' Policy 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in California, many argued, was the state board's 
16-year-old "anti-dogmatism" policy on science teaching, adopted as a 
compromise after an earlier battle between fundamentalists and scientists. That 
policy, which is replaced by the statement adopted Friday, called for 
"conditional" statements to be used in discussing the origins of life and the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say it led textbook publishers and teachers to neglect or to be 
ambiguous in teaching widely accepted scientific theories about prehistoric 
times and human development. In addition, some teachers were using the policy 
as a rationale for introducing into classrooms creationist views, which are not 
endorsed by any major scientific organization. 
</P>
<P>
Francie Alexander, the state's associate superintendent of curriculum and 
instruction, said the new policy is a "reversal of the 'dumbing down' " trend 
of recent years. Previously, she said, when a topic was as tough or 
controversial, "the implicit policy (was), 'When in doubt, throw it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do a better job if we want a more scientifically literate 
population," Alexander said. "This is one piece of a whole strategy." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Lou Sheldon, president of the Orange County-based Traditional 
Values Coalition, criticized the new policy. "We see a very good anti-dogmatism 
statement being somewhat watered down," he said. He said state education 
officials are attempting to teach evolution as a fact and are "putting 
themselves in a further adversarial role to family values." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, whose church-based group lobbied board members to reject the policy, 
said the battle is not over. He and state education officials note that the new 
policy statement is only the first step toward adoption of new, detailed 
science teaching guidelines. Those guidelines will shape the content of the 
next generation of state-funded science textbooks used in the 1990s in 
classrooms throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fighting for their view to be reflected in science teaching 
guidelines and new textbooks, the creationists will put pressure on local 
school boards not to support the state board's new policy, Sheldon said.

VERPLANK'S 65 TAKES HOPE LEAD; 
</P>
<P>
HOWEVER, STEVE PATE HAS DAY'S TOP ROUND, A 62 AT INDIAN WELLS

Scott Verplank, who said he put too much pressure on himself in his first 2 
years on the PGA Tour, applied some pressure of his own Friday in the Bob Hope 
Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Verplank shot a 65 for a 13-under-par 203 after 54 holes of the tournament. 
There has been a different name atop the leader board after every round. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's Verplank, who was regarded as an exciting newcomer and possibly 
another Ben Crenshaw, when he hit the tour in 1986, after winning the Western 
Open as an amateur the year before. However, after finishing 177th and 173rd on 
the money list in 1986 and '87, he was forced to return to qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
Verplank got his first tour win as a pro last year in the Buick Open and 
improved on the money-winning list to 31st, earning $366,044. 
</P>
<P>
He has a 2-stroke lead over Tom Kite and Mark Calcavecchia, who shot 68 and 67, 
respectively, on a clear, mild day in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
However, honors for the sensational round of the day went to Steve Pate, who 
shot a 62 at Indian Wells, including a hole-in-one on the par-3, 156-yard 
fourth hole, which was on the back side for him since he started on the 10th. 
He also had an eagle on the 483-yard, par-5 14th. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, the former UCLA star, inspired an amateur partner, 71-year-old Bill 
Bailey, who followed Pate's ace with one of his own. Bailey, driving from the 
amateur tee marker of 133 yards, hit an 8-iron for his hole-in-one. 
</P>
<P>
Pate has run the gamut of scores here through 3 rounds. He shot 81 Wednesday, 
71 Thursday and now the 62. But that still left him 11 strokes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Par took a battering again Friday when the wind on the four courses became a 
gentle breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Six players were grouped at 206, among them Peter Jacobsen, Lanny Wadkins, 
Sandy Lyle and Bernhard Langer. There were three bracketed at 207 -- Jay Don 
Blake, Fred Couples, the first-day leader, and Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
Verplank, playing at Eldorado, had 7 birdies without a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous this morning because of all the out-of-bounds stakes at 
Eldorado," Verplank said. "I haven't been driving too straight the last couple 
of months. 
</P>
<P>
"But I drove right down the middle today and made a lot of putts." 
</P>
<P>
Verplank, the youngest player on the tour in 1988 at 23, was regarded as a sure 
thing when he joined the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
When he won Western Open in 1985 as a junior at Oklahoma State, he was the 
first amateur to win a PGA tournament in 31 years, or since Gene Littler had 
last accomplished the feat. 
</P>
<P>
But he was too intense. He once said, "I've always been dedicated and 
competitive, but I've never been loose enough." 
</P>
<P>
He consulted a sports psychologist, Bob Rotella, who advised him to have fun 
and relax. 
</P>
<P>
"I just put pressure on myself," Verplank said. "Everyone goes through that, 
but I might have been an extreme case. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable now. I don't want to play as I have in the past, when 
I was so up-tight and nervous I could barely make a putt." 
</P>
<P>
Verplank is being chased by another young pro, 28-year-old Calcavecchia and a 
seasoned veteran, Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia birdied 4 of the first 5 holes at Bermuda Dunes and then birdied 
the eighth and ninth holes as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it easier when you're 4 under after 5 holes," he said. "I had an easy 
30 on the first 9, if there is such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
However, he wasn't satisfied with his round because he didn't get a birdie in 
the final 9 holes and had a bogey at the 16th hole when he had to wait 20 
minutes with his amateur partners before he could tee off. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen said that Calcavecchia might have an edge over the rest of the field 
because he's playing at Indian Wells today, which is regarded as the least 
demanding of the four courses. 
</P>
<P>
"He can reach all the par-5s, so par for him is 68 (instead of 72)," Jacobsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who played at Palmer PGA West, regarded as the toughest of the courses, 
said he was consistent Friday, as he has been so far through the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 68 to go with a 68 and 69 in his previous 2 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played in a tournament since the Nabisco last November, so I didn't 
know what to expect when I came here," said Kite, who is in his 17th year on 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Kite didn't play in the Tournament of Champions last week at La Costa because 
he hadn't won a tour event in 1988 after 7 straight years of at least 1 tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind watching a tournament on television, but not when it's a forced 
absence," he said. "I plan to be back there next year." 
</P>
<P>
Kite will play at Bermuda Dunes today, and Verplank will move over to Palmer 
PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate shot a blistering 28 on the back side of his round of 62, which is a 
stroke off the Indian Wells course record held by David Edwards and Bert 
Yancey. . . . Fuzzy Zoeller, who has a chronic back problem, withdrew for that 
reason. Mac O'Grady also withdrew, for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bailey, the amateur who matched Pate's hole-in-one, is playing in the Hope 
tournament for the 28th time. A member of Indian Wells, he has a 14 handicap. 
He first played in the 1961 Palm Springs Golf Classic, 2 years after he moved 
to the area. "In those days they were looking for people to play," Bailey said. 
"And the price was right." He recalled paying $300 to get into the tournament 
that year. It's considerably more expensive now. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Lujack, the former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from Notre Dame, 
is with a team with the lowest amateur score, 30 under par after 3 rounds.

THOMPSON PLANS TO BOYCOTT GAME IN NCAA PROTEST 
</P>

<P>
Georgetown's basketball coach, John Thompson, said Friday that he will walk off 
the court as soon as today's game against Boston College starts, to protest the 
new National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule on scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to threaten anybody; I don't want to give any ultimatums," 
Thompson said. "But when the ball goes up, I intend on getting up off the bench 
and walking out." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that he might boycott more than one game and that assistants Mike 
Riley and Craig Esherick would coach in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is protesting Proposal No. 42, approved at the NCAA convention in San 
Francisco Wednesday, which will prevent high school students who meet only part 
of the NCAA's entrance criteria from receiving scholarships their first year in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum criteria are a 2.0 grade-point average in a core curriculum and a 
minimum score on standardized entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 48, which has been in effect for 3 years, students could gain 
athletic scholarships by meeting just part of the standards -- either the 
minimum grade-point average or a passing score on an entrance exam -- but must 
sit out their freshman years. 
</P>
<P>
Also protesting the new rule in separate statements Friday were Louisiana State 
basketball Coach Dale Brown, who said the NCAA "is without compassion in 
dealing with human beings," and Temple basketball Coach John Chaney, who wants 
to sue the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal was narrowly defeated Tuesday before passing Wednesday by a 
163-154 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"With the vote as close as it was," Thompson said, "maybe it should have been 
tabled and discussed a little more, if it affects the outcome of someone's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"In moral conscience, I feel it is my responsibility to take a stand on this," 
added Thompson, who coached the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team to a bronze 
medal at the 1988 Summer Games. "I'm beginning to feel that a kid with a low 
socioeconomic background has been invited to dinner, had dessert and is now 
being asked to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson contended that the minimum standards on college entrance examinations 
treat low-income youths unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in support of core curriculum. I'm in support of 2.0," he said. "But I'm 
not in support of SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores which have been proven 
to be culturally biased." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson stopped short of calling the NCAA racist but said: "I feel it is a 
discriminatory thing, especially for a kid who is at a low socioeconomic level. 
</P>
<P>
"If I jump up and down and holler racism, everyone will lose sight of the issue 
and focus on the words." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded: "Certainly, it has an effect on black people. Athletics has 
been a vehicle and a way out, and in a lot of instances, the only hope a young 
person had. It (Proposal 42) is closing a lot of doors. It may not have been 
intended to do that, but that in fact is what it is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cawood, the NCAA's assistant executive director, said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that the delegates who voted for the proposal considered it a 
racial issue but as a means to strengthen the academic entrance requirements 
for freshman students who will participate in athletics. Although this 
legislation only may be suspended by the Division I membership in a legislative 
session, I'm sure that the members will continue to closely review the subject 
prior to next January's convention." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he planned to inform his players of his boycott decision later 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien said he thinks that Thompson "has a very valid 
point, and he feels something needs to be done right now. . . . This is going 
to make a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Timothy Healy, Georgetown's president, supported Thompson's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally behind John," he said. "As it now stands, if John has looked at a 
youngster, and he doesn't have a 700 (on his SATs), no university aid can be 
given to that youngster. That's an intrusion in Georgetown's business by the 
NCAA, and that is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he didn't know how long he would boycott NCAA-sanctioned games. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be one day. It could be five days," the coach said. "It could be one 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also complained that the timing of the NCAA convention in the middle 
of the basketball season puts coaches at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, LSU's Brown also criticized the NCAA for tightening the 
academic standards for athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"This country -- which was founded by and for all people, and not a privileged 
few -- must be vigilant that it does not turn into a society where those who do 
not meet elite standards are officially declared second-rate citizens," said 
Brown from Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was in favor of Proposition 48 when it was proposed five years ago, but 
he soon began to regard it as a stigma that follows a player through his 
college career and perhaps beyond. He has three partial qualifiers sitting out 
their freshman years this season. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rule hits hardest at underprivileged youngsters least familiar with 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and saddened at this incessant desire to label kids from the 
poorer strata as losers in the game of life," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important rule for all of us to follow is that of respecting human 
dignity, and the NCAA certainly has not followed that rule." 
</P>
<P>
Brown added: "The penalty given to those who just didn't have a high enough 
score on a test is far more severe than to an athlete who illegally secures a 
$25,000 automobile and other fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be granted immunity by the NCAA if he turns in the guilty parties, when 
he is the most guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"A youngster that did nothing illegal, but failed to meet a standard test 
score, is saved from the guillotine but is embarrassed in front of the whole 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not the justice that this great country stands for." 
</P>
<P>
Temple's Chaney, who earlier referred to the NCAA as "that racist 
organization," said: "There's only one road left, and that is to take the NCAA 
to the courts." 
</P>
<P>
Calling himself, Thompson and Brown a "committee of three" fighting the new 
rules, Chaney said he would consider any means "humanly possible" to change the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Every parent of every Proposition 48 youngster who is being deprived of an 
opportunity to go to college is willing to go court," Chaney said, adding that 
he was referring to parents he has contacted. "I see no other way out." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney said that because nearly 90% of all Proposition 48 athletes in football 
and basketball are black, the rule is also a violation of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a racist rule that has come up the pike by racist presidents. Forty of 
them and some of the coaches in this country as well," Chaney said, referring 
to school presidents who drafted the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It has taken us back and will continue to take us back 50 years as far as I'm 
concerned. For an athletic association to dream up a nightmare for black 
youngsters is totally insane." 
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press survey last year found that almost 9 of 10 college football 
players who were disqualified for the 1988 season because of Proposition 48 
were black. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 274 football players who failed to meet the NCAA's academic requirements 
in 1988, the AP was able to identify the race of 213, or 77.7%. A total of 185 
players were black, 86.8% of those identified. 
</P>
<P>
All 192 colleges and universities playing Division I-A and I-AA football 
responded to the AP survey, conducted from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula Walsh, director for research for the NCAA, told the AP that blacks 
accounted for 81% of football ineligibles in 1986, the first year of 
Proposition 48, and 90% in 1987, according to an NCAA survey. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 9.2% of college students are black, according to a survey taken in 
1986 by the Department of Education. The only data on minority football players 
is a survey taken by the College Football Assn. in 1987 that showed 41% of the 
players at its schools were minorities. The CFA is composed of 66 Division I-A 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the AP survey, Alcorn State and Bethune-Cookman, two predominantly black 
colleges, had the most ineligible players, 12 each.

ANGELS, JOYNER EXCHANGE THEIR ARBITRATION FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels and Wally Joyner exchanged arbitration figures Friday, but not 
pleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels filed at $750,000. Joyner, who earned $340,000 last season, came in 
at $965,000. If it goes to a February hearing, an arbitrator will choose one of 
the two figures as Joyner's 1989 salary. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner and the Angels can continue negotiating until the arbitrator makes a 
decision, but attorney Barry Axelrod, who represents Joyner, said the $215,000 
difference seems too large to produce a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
He said the $750,000 offer was another example of the Angels' refusal to 
negotiate in good faith with Joyner, who held out last spring, when he was not 
eligible for arbitration, before accepting the $340,000 proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"In a word, I was amused, as was Wally, who was also somewhat hurt -- again," 
Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said that Joyner's $965,000 figure was carefully arrived at and took 
into consideration his accomplishments compared to other players of his 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod listed Kirby Puckett, Jose Canseco, Will Clark, Eric Davis, Joe Carter 
and Danny Tartabull, all of whom are now in the $1-million range or will be 
when they sign 1989 contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod conceded that Joyner's home run production fell off significantly last 
year, from 34 to 13, but said that he still had another outstanding year, 
batting .295 with 85 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"He had more RBIs than Mike Marshall, who led the Dodgers," Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall drove in 82 runs and signed a multiyear contract that raised his 
salary from $760,000 to $1 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port disagreed with Axelrod, saying the exchange of 
arbitration figures defined the floor and ceiling and left "a lot of room in 
between for (compromise) possibilities." He said he was hopeful of conducting 
serious discussions leading to an amicable settlement. 
</P>
<P>
If it goes to arbitration, the Angels' case will be argued by Tal Smith, former 
general manager of the Houston Astros

<P>
EVEN WITHOUT KIMBLE, GATHERS STEPS UP FOR LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around Loyola Marymount University, they call Hank Gathers, "The Bank." The 
reason is obvious. When a big basket is needed, Gathers has been like, well, 
money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that way for the last 2 seasons, since Hank the Bank put his stock 
in Coach Paul Westhead's running system. The investment has paid off handsomely 
for both, Loyola setting scoring records on a slew of Bank shots. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Gathers' game has risen to such a spectacular level, almost 35 
points a game, that interest in the Bank is going up fast, which is the way 
Gathers and Loyola like to score. Gathers will get his next opportunity this 
morning, when the Lions (8-5) play DePaul (9-7) in a nationally televised game 
at Rosemont Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Westhead says you can't be in the system at 95%. You've got to be in it 
at 100%," Gathers said before a recent practice. "The wide-open system gives me 
an opportunity to show what I can do. It also exposes what you can't do. You've 
got to be fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's one reason our young guys are having trouble. Right now, our 
young guys haven't totally bought into the system. They don't believe you can 
go that extra 5 minutes at full speed. Once we break them in, they buy in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've bought in." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola teams have long had players who could score. Gathers follows in the 
footsteps of Greg Goorjian, Forrest McKenzie, Keith Smith and Mike Yoest, all 
of whom led the West Coast Athletic Conference in scoring this decade. But 
Westhead has turned up the pace several notches, and Gathers may be the perfect 
player for his system. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 7 inches, Gathers has to play the post as the Lions' best big man and 
start the fast break with his rebounding. As the team's only real inside 
scorer, he is also expected to finish off the break. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a combination of strength, quickness, jumping ability and speed, 
the seemingly tireless Gathers more often than not accomplishes that. After a 
redshirt year, Gathers joined the lineup last season and finished second in the 
conference in scoring, with an average of 22.5 points a game, and rebounding, 
with 8.7 a game. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just the beginning. If he remains at his current rate of 
production -- 34.9 points and 15.1 rebounds a game -- Gathers will lead the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I in both categories, joining 
Xavier McDaniel, now a pro star, as the only players to have done so. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gathers is producing at a high level of consistency. His low game 
this season is 27 points, and he has taken down fewer than 10 rebounds only 
once. He has scored more than 30 points in 9 of 11 games, with a high of 49 
against Nevada Reno, tying the school record. He has had rebounding totals of 
26 and 23 and is shooting 64% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"He has evolved as a very confident offensive player," Westhead said. "At this 
moment, he's very difficult to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he has demonstrated he can do something that will be hard to take away. I 
don't think the evolution is completed. I don't think he's nearly topped out." 
</P>
<P>
For all of his physical skills, Gathers' main attribute may be his intense 
desire on the court. His attitude goes well beyond blue-collar, closer to a 
warrior, last-one-standing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impressions were, he was very competitive and hard-working," Westhead 
said. "If there are 100 possessions, he wants to be in on all 100. That 
approach is what's gotten him where he is (while) he's been expanding his 
offensive skills." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' game combines hard work, physical gifts and several years of honing a 
short- to medium-range jump shot and one-on-one skills learned on the 
playgrounds of his native Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
As for motivation this season, Gathers has plenty. 
</P>
<P>
He still is upset about the USC episode that resulted in George Raveling asking 
him, Bo Kimble and Tom Lewis to leave USC. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, John Thompson didn't invite Gathers to the Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
And, North Carolina blew the Lions out of last year's NCAA tournament, and 
Gathers felt he had a poor game against the Tar Heels, even though he scored 19 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Not being invited to the Olympic trials particularly irked Gathers, since his 
good friend, UCLA guard Pooh Richardson, had been. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Westhead) said, 'That shows they don't respect you. Show 'em this 
year,' " Gathers said. "I'm showing 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor motivating the junior was that this would be his senior season 
if he had stayed at USC. So he felt it was time to show he was physically ready 
to play as well as the nation's top seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was at USC, I'd be shooting for the NBA," he said. "So I wanted to be 
ready, see if I was prepared. Thus far, the answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
David Spencer, the assistant coach who recruited Gathers for USC, remains close 
to him, even though Spencer is now on the coaching staff at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been able to motivate (Gathers)," Spencer said. "Hank scored a lot 
last year, but he didn't rebound that well. I said, 'If you lead the nation in 
rebounding the next 2 years, that's where you'll make your money. The pros will 
be impressed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gathers lists leading the country in rebounding as his chief goal. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be another season of the long-running "Hank and Bo Show." 
Gathers and Kimble have been on the same court together from the time they made 
the Philadelphia Dobbins Tech junior varsity in ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, a rainbow-shooting big guard who makes the game look effortless, was 
the star. Gathers was raw, just learning. He remembers the first time he was 
aware of Kimble, on a playground the summer after eighth grade. Kimble, fooling 
around by himself, was dunking. Gathers was in awe. 
</P>
<P>
Together they led Dobbins to 2 Philadelphia City titles -- they lost the title 
in their junior year to Pooh Richardson's Ben Franklin High team. Together they 
came to Los Angeles ready to put Stan Morrison on top of the Pacific 10 
Conference. Together they were dismissed from USC by Raveling, the new coach, 
at the end of their freshman year, and together they ended up helping put 
Loyola on the map last season, leading the Lions to a 28-4 record, the best in 
school history, and an NCAA tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimble, a 6-5 junior who averaged 22 points last season, began suffering 
recurring knee discomfort before this season opened, hobbled through a few 
early games and had arthroscopic surgery in late December. He's not expected 
back much before early February. 
</P>
<P>
And Kimble's absence has probably speeded Gathers' emergence. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, me being out has raised him to this level," Kimble said. "He has to 
play for Hank and Bo. There's nobody he relies on out there like we rely on 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gathers: "It gets tough down the stretch (without Kimble). We're used to 
looking for each other. (His absence) makes me feel just a little 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble concurred: "We're used to fallin' (back) on each other in the last 
minute of the game. Every place we've played together, one of us would (take 
over). Without me in there, now it's like every shot he takes is the hardest 
basket of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of in a groove. He's programmed himself. The funny thing is, if I 
was playing he'd still be scoring, but he wouldn't be leading the country. I've 
never seen Hank play like he's playing this year. Right now he's in a class by 
himself. And I've seen where he's come from." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers and Kimble grew up in the projects of North Philadelphia. They shaped 
their games in Philadelphia's Sonny Hill summer leagues. Kimble idolized 
Philadelphia 76ers star Julius Erving. Gathers, a boxing fan who grew up across 
from the gym that spawned Joe Frazier, learned to shake and bake and break down 
his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, also from the Philadelphia area, targeted them for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a great team," he said. "They just dominated the Philadelphia 
schools. Had we stayed at SC, I had hopes of having all four (blue-chip 
players) from their high school team. Hank committed first, then he helped me 
recruit Bo." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer added: "They came out of such a tough neighborhood. It's amazing what 
they came out of. Their world has exploded by getting out of Philly." 
</P>
<P>
As freshmen, they joined Lewis and Rich Grande as part of Morrison's 
outstanding Four Freshmen class. Kimble started 18 games and averaged 12 
points. Gathers started 12 times and averaged 8 points. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers liked it at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But after the season, USC eased out Morrison. The Four Freshmen demanded a 
voice in hiring a new coach and threatened to transfer en masse to another 
school if they did not approve of the choice. 
</P>
<P>
When Raveling was hired, he set a deadline for the freshmen to decide if they 
wanted to stay at USC. Only Grande told the coach he wanted to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble decided to leave. Gathers wanted to stay, and tried to talk Kimble out 
of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
But the deadline has passed and they weren't granted an extension. 
</P>
<P>
And as they were debating, they -- and Lewis -- got letters from Raveling, 
telling them their scholarships would not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could have been a very good team," Gathers said. "I felt I'd play 
under Raveling. The word was he wanted to bring in some of his own players. I 
figured I'd move somebody out. I told Bo, 'Somebody's gonna have to sit 'cause 
I'm not sitting.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I received the letter in the training room. I was kind of hurt. I laughed 
it off, but Bo had that look on his face like, 'I told you so.' " 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that Raveling was leery of keeping Gathers and Kimble 
because of possible NCAA violations involving them. The Pacific 10 last month 
reprimanded USC because two players -- unnamed, but thought to be Gathers and 
Kimble -- received airplane tickets and long-distance phone calls from a 
booster during the 1985-86 season, without the knowledge of Morrison or his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gathers and Kimble say they got airline tickets to return to Philadelphia 
over Christmas vacation, but that they later paid for the tickets. The school 
received no sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, when Gathers and Kimble looked around for a new school, Westhead's 
Philadelphia connections kicked in. Westhead grew up there, played at St. 
Joseph's and coached at LaSalle. A Philly friend suggested that Gathers and 
Kimble check out Loyola, where Westhead had just completed his first season. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers and Kimble joined UCLA transfer Corey Gaines. In their redshirt year, 
they regularly pounded the starting five. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers was a bit taken aback by the difference in facilities, but he liked the 
idea of building a new tradition at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"At SC, we had one of the best weight rooms in the nation . . . like you were 
working out in luxury," he said. "It was so nice in there it didn't look like 
you should work out in there. Here (Loyola) we had a hell hole. I thought maybe 
it would motivate me." 
</P>
<P>
(Loyola has since installed new weight machines for its athletic program.) 
</P>
<P>
By midseason last year, the Lions were leading the country in scoring, filling 
up 4,150-seat Gersten Pavilion, and the players -- with Gathers as one of the 
vocal and emotional linchpins -- were feeling like pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was the intention of him and Kimble to turn the school into a 
college basketball powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Our record in that is pretty good," Gathers said. "Our high school hadn't won 
a championship in 39 years. It felt real good to have a sellout crowd here. It 
was no fun to draw 3,000 people at the Sports Arena (with USC). Coming over 
here, things just worked out. I guess it was God's will. I've got to look back 
and say, 'God, I'm glad I got out of there.' For my basketball career, this was 
my best move." 
</P>
<P>
The players found themselves welcomed on campus, though Gathers said that for 
the first year, "It was 'Hank and Bo, the two guys from SC.' You rarely hear 
that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
As last season progressed, Gathers and Kimble were in often in demand by 
reporters, who found them to be charming and colorful interviews -- a line the 
outgoing Gathers hopes to develop someday as a sports commentator. 
</P>
<P>
If Gathers' numbers remain so lofty through conference play, he may start 
getting attention from the pro scouts. For now, he says he hasn't considered 
leaving early, and both he and Westhead say there are still some tricks to be 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
Said Westhead: "For us, his task is a difficult one. For all his scoring, we 
still need a hard-working, running, rebounding, defensive player, and he's been 
doing this. I think the future of Hank is, he'll become a much more poised 
player, which we're already seeing. Then he'll become really lethal." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead is banking on it.

CAPITALS, STILL ON TEAR, SHUT DOWN OILERS

<P>
The Washington Capitals have been consistent for most of this decade. They 
start out each season poorly, make a move in midseason and wind up as a good 
hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Capitals have been true to form. They won only 4 of their first 14 
games and fell into the Patrick Division cellar. But now that the season is 
past its midpoint, they are a team on the move. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, rookie John Druce scored the go-ahead goal in the second period 
to lead the Capitals to a 5-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Landover, 
Md., and stretch their unbeaten streak to 9 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hunter and Mike Millar also scored in the second period to help lift the 
Capitals into first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, New Jersey 3 -- Rookie Rob DiMaio, called up from the 
minors just a few days ago, scored his first goal midway through the third 
period at East Rutherford, N.J., to break a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 3, Vancouver 1 -- Pat Elynuik scored the tie-breaking goal 5 minutes 
into the third period, and Thomas Steen added another goal as the Jets ended a 
6-game road winless string. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Luis Alves scored one goal and set up another to give Mexico's Club America 
soccer team a 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich of West Germany in an exhibition 
match Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Alves' offensive play supported the goalkeeping of Adrian Chavez, who withstood 
a barrage of Bayern Munich shots to record 9 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Club America went ahead, 2-1, with 22 minutes left when Alves grounded a 
diagonal pass to Juan Hernandez, who broke away from the Bayern Munich defense 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
The match was played before an estimated crowd of 11,500 -- the largest to see 
a soccer match in Santa Ana sinc Dec. 4, 1987, when 11,700 watched an Olympic 
qualifying match between Mexico and Guyana. AL PRESTON

SOUTHPAW BOHN EARNS NO. 1 SEEDING FOR TODAY'S FINALS

One thing is for sure, the competition will be hot in the pro bowling final of 
the AC/Delco tournament at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
When the TV lights go on at Gable House Bowl in Torrance for the national 
telecast, "it'll be like a heat wave hitting," said Parker Bohn III. 
</P>
<P>
Bohn, who averaged better than 222 for 42 games, finished as the qualifying 
leader. So, it will be the lean left-hander from New Jersey seeded No. 1 in the 
roll-off for the $27,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
He'll wait in the wings for a single-game showdown to see which of the four 
finalists, all right-handers, he'll meet for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Arizonan James A. Miller is the No. 2 bowler in the finals, with Randy Pedersen 
of Santa Maria No. 3, Pennsylvanian Ron Palombi Jr. No. 4 and Oregonian 
Marshall Holman No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen could break an 18-year-old jinx by earning his fourth PBA victory. A 
Southern Californian hasn't won a title in this region since Gary Madison of 
San Bernardino won at Anaheim in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Holman, one of pro bowling's all-time champions, made his big move Friday to 
reach the finals. He was in 19th place starting the day. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Bohn's fifth TV final, and he said the experience has him ready to 
face the lights once again. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't so much the temperature that bothers a bowler in a TV final, but the 
quick-drying affect of oil on the lanes," Bohn said. "It can drastically change 
lane conditions in the middle of a match. So, it calls for quick adjustments on 
delivery." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Voss, the 1988 money champion, finished ninth, and Hall of Famer Mark 
Roth was 19th.

BOXING / EARL GUSTKEY;

<P>
NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN MANCINI AND CAMACHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini balanced a plate on one knee and stabbed at chunks of 
fruit with a plastic fork. With his other hand, he slapped his free knee, 
possibly imagining that it was Hector Camacho's face. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't for money!" he told a reporter, in an agitated manner. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that beating Hector Camacho would be more a public service 
than strictly a business proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I'm doing this just for the money. Hey, I've been offered more 
money to come back and fight Roger Mayweather, Greg Haugen and Juan Coggi. But 
none of those fights turned me on. This one does." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini pointed across the room toward Camacho. The prince of New York's 
Spanish Harlem was flexing his muscles for photographers, mock-combing his 
hair, showing off his gold chains and preening. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe him?" Mancini said, stuffing more grapefruit wedges in his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get up for this guy, believe me. It used to be, years ago, he just 
bothered me. He was like a mosquito that had flown into a room I was in. But 
now, he's a lot more annoying. Now I finally get to pick up the fly swatter." 
</P>
<P>
This was at a news conference the other day to announce the date, March 6, and 
site, Reno, for Mancini's return to boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini looked over his shoulder again at Camacho. The Macho Man was flexing 
again and asking a woman if she was married. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," Mancini said, disgustedly. 
</P>
<P>
"See, those people are laughing, but he doesn't understand that they're 
laughing at him, not with him." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, 27, has been out of the ring for 47 months, since he absorbed a second 
beating from Livingstone Bramble and retired. Since then, he has appeared in 
two movies, two TV shows and 10 commercials, made a workout video, done some 
boxing TV commentary and bought a condo in Santa Monica and a house in 
Youngstown, Ohio, his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Monica is nice, but Youngstown is forever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So we probably can believe him when he says he doesn't need to fight Camacho to 
pay bills. It should be noted, however, that the promoters are saying that the 
two will split a guaranteed $2 million, and that pay-per-view revenue could 
kick it up to an additional $2 million to $3 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mancini pushes the public service message. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't respect a guy who looks down at society's rules and says: 'I'm going 
to do anything I want.' He's bad for boxing, a poor role model for kids. How 
would you like it if your son was looking up to this guy? 
</P>
<P>
"People from Spanish Harlem have come up to me and said: 'Please, whip this 
guy's . . . He's disgraced us." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini's references to Camacho's questionable citizenship are presumably 
spurred by Camacho's arrest record. The latest entry, last February, included 
charges involving cocaine possession and assault in a Florida case. 
</P>
<P>
When these two boxers were put in the same room this week, you wanted to hold 
your breath, and not just because a company such as Warner Bros., the 
pay-per-view telecast distributor, would enter into a multimillion-dollar deal 
with a guy who once did 3 1/2 months at Rikers Island for grand theft, auto. 
</P>
<P>
No, you also worried that since we're now in an era in which television's 
influence is pulling pro boxing promotions alarmingly close to the cartoon-like 
silliness of pro wrestling's, someone might throw a chair. Or a fruit plate. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho tried. He got under Mancini's skin a couple of times, but Mancini 
stayed cool. Camacho stayed silly. When they posed for photographers together, 
fists up, the cameramen motioned for them to get closer together. 
</P>
<P>
When they did, Camacho, leering, said to Mancini: "Hey, you're breathin' in my 
ear, Ray. You must have a passion for me." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, who began training in Las Vegas this week, said he would train 5 weeks 
in Las Vegas, then 3 in Reno. One Las Vegas oddsmaker already has made him a 3 
1/2-1 underdog. 
</P>
<P>
The bout will be at 140 pounds, a good number for Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
"I weigh 140-141 right now," he said. "I'll have to maintain weight in 
training, not take it off. Believe me, I'll be in shape for this guy, because 
he's going to run from me all night. If there's a door in that ring, he'll find 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, manager of Michael Nunn, said Thursday that Nunn could earn $8 
million in 1989 without fighting Sugar Ray Leonard or Thomas Hearns, which is 
what promoter Bob Arum is trying to arrange. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like 1989 will be a big year for Michael," Goossen said, grinning at 
the understatement. "If it works out that Leonard and Hearns get together, and 
that Michael wins the undisputed middleweight title and then gets the 
Leonard-Hearns winner, that would be icing on the cake. 
</P>
<P>
"But even without that happening, we project Michael making something like $5 
million to $6 million meeting (Sumbu) Kalambay, then unifying the title against 
the (Iran) Barkley-(Roberto) Duran winner. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, if Leonard or Hearns aren't there for us, we'd probably defend 
the undisputed title once here, then maybe go to England (in early 1990, most 
likely) and meet someone like Nigel Benn for $3 million." 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's Los Angeles news conference for the Nunn-Kalambay fight, which 
will be March 25 at the Las Vegas Hilton, Hearns, who was present along with 
Leonard, offered another name for the suddenly interesting middleweight 
sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Marvin Hagler is back in the gym and working out, so I know he's 
at least thinking of coming back," Hearns said. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
A couple of big guys, in separate bouts, are set for the Ray Mancini-Hector 
Camacho undercard: George Foreman and Riddick Bowe, the U.S. Olympic 
super-heavyweight silver medalist. . . . "A Night with the Weavers" is the 
theme for the Jan. 31 show at the Country Club in Reseda, where heavyweight 
Mike Weaver, 37, and his triplet sons, middleweights Floyd, Lloyd and Troy, all 
will box on the same card for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Jan. 31, heavyweights Mark Wills and Donnie Coats will meet at the 
Irvine Marriott. . . . CBS offers junior welterweights Frankie Warren and 
Mickey Ward Sunday from Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
When Mike Tyson, visiting his estranged wife, Robin Givens, was involved in an 
altercation Wednesday night with a reporter and a TV cameraman in Vancouver, 
Canada, his adviser, Don King, didn't even know he had left Las Vegas, a Las 
Vegas Hilton source reports. Tyson had been in Las Vegas for 2 weeks, training 
for his bout with Frank Bruno Feb. 25. The first posted Las Vegas odds favor 
Tyson over Bruno, 9-1.

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball may be allowed to change his guilty plea in 
a drunk-driving manslaughter case to safeguard insurance money for victims and 
their families, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea Kimball entered Wednesday could amount to a breach of contract 
and allow his insurance company to cancel a $1.3-million liability policy, 
Frank Quesada, a lawyer for the 1984 silver medalist, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company could cut Kimball loose," he said. "It has nothing to do with the 
way Bruce feels. . . . A change (in pleas) would be all for the victims." 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe III said he would accept a no-contest 
plea if it's proven that Kinball's policy would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball had pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of testimony 
about the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and injured four others. He 
said he wanted to spare the families the grief of hearing descriptions about 
how his car plowed into the youths on a dead-end road in Brandon, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
There are four civil lawsuits pending against Kimball stemming from the 
accident, which occurred a month before the 1988 Olympic diving trials. He 
participated in the trials but failed to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
If the victims' lawsuits are successful, money from Kimball's liability 
insurance policy could pay for damages.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / ROBYN NORWOOD;

<P>
BRUNDY TAKES SHOTS AT DEPAUL RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Brundy never took to Los Angeles. He didn't like it when he came here 
from New Orleans and, after playing at Crenshaw High School for 2 years, he 
went to college elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
His departure has been DePaul's gain. This season, he is leading the Blue 
Demons in scoring at 18 points a game, rebounding at 6 a game, field goal 
percentage at 65%, blocked shots at 24, and steals at 35. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, he had the best game of his career against a Los Angeles 
school, scoring 47 points and pulling down 20 rebounds in a 115-111 victory 
over Loyola Marymount in the championship game of DePaul's tournament in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
It was a performance that put him in good company in DePaul basketball lore. 
His scoring total was 6 points shy of George Mikan's school record of 53, set 
in 1945, and tied him for second with Mark Aguirre, who scored 47 against Maine 
in 1981. The only other DePaul players to have scored 30 points and have taken 
down 15 rebounds in a game are Aguirre and Terry Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, Loyola Marymount will see Brundy again today, when the teams 
meet at the Rosemont Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Brundy wasn't the star of the undefeated 1984-85 Crenshaw team that won the 
City 4-A championship and the State Division I championship. He averaged 14 
points a game on a team that counted among its members Stevie Thompson, now at 
Syracuse, and Ron Caldwell and Dion Brown, both now at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But he has come into his own at DePaul, where he has scored 1,025 points in 95 
games and has made a place for himself with the best career field goal 
percentage in school history. 
</P>
<P>
His repertoire of dunks, layups and a shot that school publicist Tim Stephens 
calls "a running one-hander sort of hook from 3 feet out," has him at 62% for 
his career. He is so far ahead of second place, which is 55.3%, that he could 
miss his next 88 shots and not lose the record. 
</P>
<P>
His mark is also the highest of any active player and puts him at No. 19 on the 
NCAA's all-time list, wedged between Patrick Ewing and Brad Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
The free throw line is a different matter. Fifteen feet apparently is beyond 
his range. Brundy has made just 32 of 74 from the line this season, or 43%. 
</P>
<P>
He is such a disaster at the line that he shoots 100 free throws before 
practice, 100 after, thinks about them "day and night," and still gets no 
better. 
</P>
<P>
It has been so bad that Coach Joey Meyer, for a time, took to not watching when 
Brundy was at the line. But the laughter from bench-warmers who caught on 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That would be good-natured laughter, of course. Brundy is the cornerstone of 
the 9-7 team, which has lost 6 games to teams ranked in the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
But we like your nose, Coach K: Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski turned philosophical 
this week in responding to a question about the Blue Devils' No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you rather not be No. 1?" a reporter asked, perhaps conditioned by Dean 
Smith's classic -- and often comic -- complaint about the trauma of holding the 
top spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Being ranked No. 1 is fine," Krzyzewski said. "You're like my wife, asking 
about all those hypothetical situations. I'd rather deal with the fact that we 
are ranked No. 1. That's just where it's at. If we're not No. 1, then I'll deal 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a big nose. But I don't sit around saying, 'I wonder what it would be 
like without a big nose. I'd like a little one.' I don't do things like that. 
What do you think? Do you think I'd look better with a little nose?" 
</P>
<P>
Duke beat William &amp; Mary this week, 100-38. 
</P>
<P>
Just think if Mary hadn't played. 
</P>
<P>
How to explain the scheduling of a game that proved so lopsided? 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary, a school in Williamsburg, Va., is something of a 
traditional opponent and has a 2-23 record against Duke. The Indians are 
coached by Chuck Swenson, who began his basketball career as a manager of the 
Indiana basketball team under Bob Knight and worked as an assistant to 
Krzyzewski at Army for 3 years and at Duke for 7. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the scheduling a friendly gesture by Krzyzewski, providing his friend 
with a big-time game that appeals to recruits and gets some exposure for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The same explanation holds for another Duke blowout this year, a 94-59 win over 
Cornell, a team coached by Mike Dement, who was an assistant at Duke in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Steele and the city of Portland have done all right by each other for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
Steele played for the Trail Blazers for 9 years and helped Portland win a 
National Basketball Assn. title in 1977 with his hustle and uncanny outside 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is at work at a task that is proving more difficult than his days in the 
NBA, coaching a University of Portland basketball team that is 0-14 this season 
and has a 20-game losing streak, the longest current streak in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack Avina quit 2 years ago, the Pilots hired Steele after Dave Twardzik, 
another former Trail Blazer, turned down the job. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Steele was marketing manager for the Trail Blazers. He had never 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots finished 6-22 in his first season. This season, they have played 
only one team below the Division I level, Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots lost to the Division II Loggers, 75-71, after blowing a 13-point 
lead in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We started hoping we would win," Steele told the Associated Press. "I think 
that was the problem."

AGENT SAYS GRIFFIN TO SIGN WITH DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Hendricks, the agent for Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin, said Friday 
that Griffin has decided to sign a contract he agreed to in November. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin had been considering a grievance procedure because he forfeited his 
rights to free agency by agreeing to contract terms before the Dodgers' 
deadline for signing their eligible free agents. The club then lifted the 
deadline to continue negotiations with Steve Sax and Mike Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin contended that the Dodgers had curtailed his bargaining power by 
pressuring him to sign before a deadline they later dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's contract calls for a guaranteed $900,000 in 1989 and 1990, and 
another $900,000 that is not guaranteed in 1991. Griffin failed in an attempt 
to have the Dodgers guarantee that final year as compensation for dropping the 
threat of a legal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, meanwhile, announced that they had reached 1989 terms with three 
players who were eligible for salary arbitration, first baseman Franklin 
Stubbs, pitcher Ricky Horton and infielder Mariano Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs got a $110,000 raise to $345,000. Duncan agreed to the same $200,000 he 
earned last year. Horton's terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Five Dodgers -- Orel Hershiser, Tim Leary, Rick Dempsey, Dave Anderson and Ray 
Searage -- remain eligible for arbitration and have until 9 a.m. Monday to 
file. ROSS NEWHAN

SAILING / RICH ROBERTS: NEW AMERICA'S CUP GROUP FORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are San Diego's America's Cup interests cleaning up their act? 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems of last September's tainted defense against New Zealand 
resulted from the Sail America Foundation's perceived arrogance in managing the 
affair for the San Diego Yacht Club -- among other things, in hand-picking 
Dennis Conner to defend, then allowing him to sail a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
Many club members were left outraged, embarrassed or both. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a consolidation of the three main entities -- SDYC, Sail America and 
the city's America's Cup Task Force -- into a single new America's Cup 
Organizing Committee was announced. The group, with a 16-member board of 
directors, will oversee the next defense in 1991 -- assuming that New York 
Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick OKs the catamaran and allows San Diego to 
keep the cup. 
</P>
<P>
The power will still be with the old Sail America people. President Malin 
Burnham will chair the new ACOC board. Executive Vice President Tom Ehman will 
continue to run things day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can tell you it's different," said Dr. Fred Frye, an ACOC board member 
who was SDYC commodore when Conner won the Cup at Fremantle, Australia, 2 years 
ago. "We're all sitting at the same table now." 
</P>
<P>
Conner's profile may be lowered and Sail America will cease to exist, as will 
chairman Gerry Driscoll's America's Cup Defense Committee, which wound up 
gutted of authority -- oddly, after an initial big row about who should be on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
That's one wound that may not heal. Driscoll was not nominated to the ACOC 
board, although two of his committee members were -- Kim Fletcher and Gene 
Trepte. But Driscoll is highly regarded in the sailing community and may yet 
have a meaningful place somewhere in the new scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'd like to be involved the next time around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Driscoll, a former America's Cup campaigner, will form his own defense 
syndicate and hire a skipper to compete with Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes team. 
He attended a meeting of potential American challengers -- potential, if New 
Zealand KOs the catamaran -- held by the Kiwis at Marina del Rey this week. 
</P>
<P>
Others there included Tom Blackaller of San Francisco, James Michaels of the 
New York YC and Dave Vietor of Boston -- all rooting for the Kiwis to win in 
court so they could go to Auckland and win the Cup for their own American 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
With the Soviet Union planning to compete in '91, in a Soviet-San Diego final 
the other Americans could even wind up rooting for the Soviet boat. 
</P>
<P>
The Deed of Gift says the Cup is a competition "between foreign countries." San 
Diego was able to win it only after New York lost it to the Royal Perth YC of 
Australia. Blackaller, speaking for most of the others, has said he has no 
interest in competing to defend the Cup for San Diego, where Conner is king. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said: "No one has a lock on being the defender, including Dennis 
Conner. We need competition between defense syndicates. Competition improves 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
If Burnham and the ACOC really mean that, they should move to dump the 
senseless policy that forces a defender to defend only for the club that holds 
the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
A press release on the new plan didn't mention Conner at all. Is there a sense 
that he has become bigger -- figuratively -- than the America's Cup itself? For 
the last defense he was skipper and chief event fund raiser, through his Dennis 
Conner Sports Inc. marketing organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis probably symbolizes the America's Cup in the United States," Fletcher 
said. "I didn't dream he'd get as many endorsements as he has." 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC, created by agreement between the SDYC and Sail America, is a step 
toward correcting a situation that caused a lot of hard feelings and confused 
outsiders. Credit goes to Ehman, who brought everybody together and crafted the 
guidelines for the new organization. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the 14 clauses in the agreement seem to address Conner's role 
specifically. One notes that any funding of defense syndicates by the ACOC must 
be distributed equally, except by consent of the SDYC board, but the next one 
is the crunch: "Fund raising for both the event and one or more syndicates by 
the same commercial fund-raising organization requires the consent of SDYC." 
</P>
<P>
"And there's no way they'd let him do both," an ACOC insider said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Conner would have to decide whether to raise funds for the ACOC 
or only for his own Stars &amp; Stripes syndicate. That could pose a problem 
for him, since DC Sports collects 20% off the top, and also for the ACOC, since 
Conner is still sailing's best fund raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC may be counting on making up the difference with TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Should Conner decide to raise money only for Stars &amp; Stripes, he would 
start with a huge edge on defense rivals, although that could be mitigated by 
the new America's Cup practice -- the catamaran plastered with advertising last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 25 potential challengers met in San Diego last weekend and discussed 
permitting ads on hulls and spinnakers only. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they aren't quite ready for a Foster &amp; Kleiser Cup, but they'll 
have to find some way to pay for the new America's Cup class boats, which will 
cost $2 million-$2.5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
The leading order of business in San Diego was supposed to be to approve the 
new boat, which is bigger and faster than a 12-meter and is a consensus of 
input from most of the world's major designers of ocean racing sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
That matter took about 5 minutes, and the syndicate representatives also 
readily approved a best-of-7 format around an 8-legged course, rather than last 
September's sleepy cruise to Mexico. The rest of the time was spent talking 
about advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The SDYC and Mercury Bay Club indicated that they have no problem with any of 
the above, whichever defends in '91. 
</P>
<P>
The four Soviet Union syndicates -- four separate efforts under a common "Sail 
USSR" banner -- are represented by a Finnish businessman from Seattle named 
Reijo Salminen. They got a 90-day extension to come up with their entry fees of 
$25,000 apiece, claiming a problem with red tape. 
</P>
<P>
One curious clause of the ACOC agreement would prohibit the organization from 
"entering into marketing contracts which involve the promotion, sale or use of 
tobacco products." 
</P>
<P>
Marlboro was a major sponsor of the '88 defense and much in evidence on land, 
sea and in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Solo sailor Guy Bernardin reported passing the Equator this week, heading south 
in his attempt to break the 19th Century record from New York to San Francisco 
via Cape Horn. Bernardin, whose boat was sunk at the Cape in an attempt last 
year, was averaging 8 knots, which would put him ahead of the 89-day record, 
but has had to put into shore twice for minor repairs to his 60-foot craft. 
Three Floridians sailing 60-foot Thursday's Child passed the Horn 7 days ahead 
of the record schedule, despite losing 3 days for hull repairs in the 
Falklands. Latest to leave New York on Jan. 1 was Anne Llardet with crewman 
Joseph Le Guen in a 50-foot trimaran. 
</P>
<P>
TV sailing commentator Gary Jobson will present the only Southern California 
appearance of his "Wide World of Sailing" program at the Balboa Yacht Club Feb. 
3. Tickets are $10 and available at West Marine Products stores, with some 
proceeds going to area youth sailing organizations. . . . Dennis Conner will 
sail an 8-race match series in the Kookaburra 12-meters against Australia's 
Iain Murray in Sydney Harbor Jan. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
California Yacht Club's third annual Mini America's Cup match racing series is 
scheduled Feb. 4, starting at 11:30 a.m., but don't look for any 12-meters. The 
event is sailed in Capri 14.2 dinghies, inside the marina near the CYC dock. 
Defending champion Craig Leweck, Stars &amp; Stripes navigator Peter Isler and 
wife J.J. Isler, will compete.

WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
AT 9, SUPER DIAMOND MAKES ANOTHER COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides a good nickel cigar, what this country needs is a match race between 
Super Diamond and King's Swan, a pair of resilient 9-year-old geldings that 
have combined to win almost $3 million while running a continent apart. 
</P>
<P>
Since King's Swan is a New York horse and Super Diamond does all of his running 
in California, it is unlikely that they will ever meet. Meantime, Santa Anita 
will be the setting for Super Diamond's return to the races today, when he 
makes his first start in 10 months by running in the $100,000 San Carlos 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, who has earned $1.3 million, more than $300,000 short of King's 
Swan's total, has made more comebacks than Sugar Ray Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
He had a wrenched ankle as a 2-year-old, he underwent arthroscopic surgery for 
a bone chip on the same ankle 2 years later, he tore a ligament near the knee 
as a 5-year-old and now he's trying to rebound from the most serious injury of 
all, torn tissue in a tendon. And while you're asking, doctor, Super Diamond 
bled from the lungs during a race at Santa Anita in 1986 and has run with 
Lasix, a preventive, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond has been around so long that he has run against Gato Del Sol, who 
won the 1982 Kentucky Derby, and also against Alysheba and Ferdinand, the 
respective winners of the Derby in 1986 and 1987. Some of the horses Super 
Diamond has beaten in his 9 stake wins include Skywalker, winner of the Santa 
Anita Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic, and Precisionist, the country's 
champion sprinter in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Old horses are not rarities, but horses like Super Diamond and King's Swan, who 
can still compete in major stakes competition as 9-year-olds, are virtually 
unheard of. John Henry was horse of the year in 1984 as a 9-year-old; Kelso, 
5-time horse of the year in the 1960s, ran once as a 9- year-old, but his best 
days were past; and Forego, winner of 3 straight horse-of-the-year titles in 
the 1970s, was through after his 8-year-old season. 
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years of the San Carlos, the oldest horses to win have been 
8-year-olds -- Native Diver in 1967 and Autocrat in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond would not appear to have much chance today at 7 furlongs against 
On the Line, who has won 3 straight since returning from a long layoff of his 
own, but trainer Eddie Gregson's veteran has won from off the farm before. In 
1987, after 8 months of time off had healed the ligament damage, Super Diamond 
won the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar in his first start back. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his frailties, Super Diamond has run only 34 times, compared to 87 
by King's Swan, and last year was typical. Super Diamond made up 7 lengths in 
the stretch, losing by a nose to Epidaurus, in the San Carlos. Then, after 
winning the San Pasqual Handicap and running third to Alysheba and Ferdinand in 
the Santa Anita Handicap, his season -- and his career -- appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
Examinations showed that Super Diamond had suffered a slight tearing of tissue 
in a tendon in his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Greg Ferraro, the veterinarian, examined the leg and was 
optimistic about returning Super Diamond to training. 
</P>
<P>
"If Greg had had any reservations at all, we wouldn't have done it," Gregson 
said. "I don't want this horse eventually being retired and having a big, fat 
leg the rest of his life. Whether he makes it or not, though, I would have to 
say that this is the horse's last go-round." 
</P>
<P>
Because Super Diamond doesn't work in company with other horses, Gregson 
doesn't know whether he's lost a step or not. The 50-year-old Gregson, who won 
the Kentucky Derby with Gato Del Sol in 1982, can't remember ever training a 
horse this old, even when he had cheap claimers in the Bay Area in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should go to Ron McAnally for advice," Gregson said. "With John Henry, 
he did the greatest training job -- under all that pressure -- that I've ever 
seen with an older horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that bringing a horse back from a tendon injury is tough. This isn't a 
classic case of a bowed tendon, because the tendon is straight. But I've had 
about 30 horses that got tendon injuries, and maybe only 3 made it back. And I 
can't remember the names of 2 of those." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Gregson is running Undercut, a European horse trying dirt for the first 
time, in Sunday's $200,000 San Fernando, the first major stake of the Santa 
Anita season. . . . The 12-horse field of 4-year-olds for the 1 1/8-mile San 
Fernando lines up this way: 
</P>
<P>
Mi Preferido, Chris McCarron riding, 123 pounds; Dynaformer, Angel Cordero, 
126; Raykou, Sandy Hawley, 114; Triteamtri, Fernando Toro, 120; Perceive 
Arrogance, Jose Santos, 120; Drouilly's Boy, Frank Olivares, 114; Star 
Attitude, Ray Sibille, 114; Oraibi, Laffit Pincay, 120; Undercut, Corey Black, 
114; Speedratic, Gary Stevens, 120; Claim, Aaron Gryder, 117; and Blade of the 
Ball, Martin Pedroza, 114. 
</P>
<P>
Toro, who flew to Chile to be with his ailing mother, is not likely to be back 
in time to ride Sunday. . . . Candi's Gold, a multiple stakes winner under 
Gregson, has been retired because of a back injury and will stand at stud in 
Kentucky. . . . Gregson is one of many trainers upset with the condition of 
Santa Anita's turf course, which has been used for only 3 races this season. 
"The other day, there were so many divots being kicked in the air that it 
looked like there were a hundred gophers out there," Gregson said. "It's 
dangerous." Added trainer Charlie Whittingham: "They've tried to fix it by 
adding a lot of sand and they've made a mistake. Do you ever see grass growing 
on a beach?" . . . Tom Robbins, Santa Anita's racing secretary, says that the 
track has been the victim of cold, rainy weather. "It's not the kind of weather 
that dries a grass course," Robbins said. "We've had about 6 inches of rain 
since mid-December and you can see frost on the grass some mornings."

2ND WOMAN SAYS SHE HEARD STALKER JUROR EXPRESS BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second witness testified on Friday that she heard a black juror in the 
impending Night Stalker trial say that he would not impose the death penalty on 
defendant Richard Ramirez until more Anglos were on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
That accusation was first made Thursday by a prospective alternate juror in the 
case, a charge that was vigorously denied by the juror. But Friday's testimony 
by the second witness, who also was a prospective alternate juror until she was 
excused on Thursday, left the controversy unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan set a further hearing for 
Tuesday morning, at which time the first witness may be called to re-testify. 
He also postponed the start of the trial from Jan. 23 to Jan. 30 to allow more 
time to sort out the juror controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Both witnesses are Anglo women and have said they would like to have sat as 
jurors or alternates in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Both women also testified that it was their perception that the scores of 
remaining prospective jurors generally believe that the lawyers are barring 
Anglos from sitting as jurors. The jury, sworn in Tuesday, is made up of six 
blacks and six Latinos. Alternates have not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a common understanding," the second witness, Deborah A. Drake, 
testified on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just so obvious," she said in reference to the jury's racial makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Drake added that the issue had become a joking matter in the corridors during 
recesses. Both blacks and whites have remarked in jest that "you need a tan" in 
order to sit on the jury, according to Drake, an airline reservations telephone 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
She said she heard such remarks "every time we were in the hallways." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struck Her as Unfair 
</P>
<P>
The apparent exclusion of Anglos from the jury, Drake said, struck her as being 
unfair and has resulted in a jury that is not a representative cross-section of 
Los Angeles County. She said she believes that the defense was discriminating 
against Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
During the earlier phases of jury selection, Ramirez's lawyers had sought 
unsuccessfully to make a case that the county's procedure for selecting pools 
of potential jurors is biased against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom after Friday's unusual hearing, co-prosecutor Phil Halpin 
was asked about Drake's characterization of the jury's racial composition. He 
responded: "I don't know anything about that." 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said he intends to recommend to Tynan that "we go forward -- one way or 
another," but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hernandez, Ramirez's lawyer, refused to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of 13 Murders 
</P>
<P>
For now, the issue does not appear likely to adversely affect the prosecution 
of Ramirez, the drifter accused of murdering 13 Los Angeles County residents. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge and the lawyers now are faced with the question of what to do 
about the juror accused of making the remark. The man, unidentified in keeping 
with the judge's request that jurors' names not be disclosed in a pending case, 
has denied under oath making the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan has said he cannot rule out the possibility that the entire jury 
selection process, which began July 21, may have to start anew. 
</P>
<P>
Both Drake and the other woman, whose name is not being disclosed because she 
is still technically a prospective alternate juror, said they had been 
strolling down the crowded courthouse corridor during a court recess last week 
when they overheard the juror make his remarks to at least two other men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Oath 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Drake said, she believes that the other men may be jurors or 
potential jurors in the case as well because they were also wearing 
county-issued juror badges. 
</P>
<P>
The juror said under oath on Thursday that he has never spoken to anyone 
outside court about the case. And he said his only conversations with other 
jurors and prospective jurors have pertained to sports and weather, adding that 
he has made a point of keeping to himself during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The accused juror was not present for Friday's hearing. He said on Thursday 
that he had read a Time magazine story about the disproportionate number of 
ethnic minorities on Death Row throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
And on Oct. 12, during an earlier phase of jury selection that dealt entirely 
with a prospective juror's views toward the death penalty, the juror had said 
during individual questioning by the judge and the lawyers that, based on his 
readings, he believed that capital punishment in this country was being applied 
"unfairly . . . as far as race is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believes in Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
But he also said he believes that there is a general need for the death penalty 
and that he would not be reluctant to impose that sentence in any specific case 
as long as the evidence warranted it. "Race would not have any bearing on it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first woman to accuse the juror said she came forward only after Drake had 
been excused from the case, saying she was "feeling guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Drake on Friday said she did not report the man's remarks because she had 
assumed that the man had made known his views on capital punishment during his 
October session with Tynan, Hernandez, Halpin and Halpin's co-prosecutor, Los 
Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phoned Other Woman 
</P>
<P>
Neither woman was able to recite verbatim what they allegedly overheard. Drake 
said the man used the term "Hispanic," but the other witness said she heard the 
juror say "Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
Drake also admitted that, after she was summoned on Thursday afternoon to 
return to court the next morning, she telephoned the other woman at home, 
hoping to learn the reason for her summons. 
</P>
<P>
But Drake said they did not discuss the substance of the matter -- Drake having 
surmised the reason correctly. The first woman is expected to be asked on 
Tuesday about that telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has been held in County Jail without bail since he was captured by 
citizens in East Los Angeles on Labor Day Weekend in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The current flap capped a week during which an increasingly exasperated Tynan 
has stepped up his continuing admonition to all jurors and prospective 
alternate jurors not to discuss any facet of the case among themselves or with 
anyone else, even at home. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Wednesday afternoon, the judge had to dismiss three prospective 
alternate jurors for having discussed the apparent mental agitation of another 
prospective juror who had been excused from the case.

 SITE ON PARADE ROUTE SOLD FOR $11 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Pasadena Elks Lodge have agreed to sell a parking lot at a key 
location along the Tournament of Roses parade route for almost $11 million, 
lodge officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramser Development Co. said it will use the parcel near "perhaps the most 
visible corner in the world" -- the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado 
boulevards -- for construction of a luxury hotel, commercial space and an 
underground parking facility. 
</P>
<P>
Lodge 672 said the land is just too valuable to continue using it as a parking 
lot. Under terms of the proposed sale, the Elks and Ramser will continue to 
rent television and seating rights at the property during future Tournament of 
Roses parades.

 JUDGE WON'T RELEASE ACCUSED DEA AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge rejected electronic monitoring of John Anthony 
Jackson on Friday and once again denied bail for the former Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not of a mind to experiment with this monitoring," said U.S. District 
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. "You (Jackson) will remain detained." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's lawyer, John Robertson, proposed that his 39-year-old client wear a 
monitoring bracelet, which would broadcast 24 hours a day. If the signal was 
interrupted, Robertson said, a private monitoring service would notify 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Hatter refused to release Jackson last week, declaring that he was not 
satisfied that Jackson could buy an expensive home and several businesses on 
the $30,000 or $40,000 yearly salary of a DEA agent. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and two other former drug agency agents, Darnell Garcia, 41, and Wayne 
Countryman, 45, were indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges of 
conspiring to evade Internal Revenue Services taxes by laundering more than 
$600,000 through foreign banks. Garcia is still a fugitive. Countryman was 
freed on $120,000 bail.

STUDENTS STAGE SIT-IN AT S. AFRICA CONSULATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 30 students staged a sit-in Friday outside the South African Consulate in 
Beverly Hills, vowing to stay there until Martin Luther King Day on Monday -- 
barring their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The students, carrying sleeping bags, pillows and a change of clothes, camped 
on the third floor of the consulate office at 50 N. La Cienega Blvd. and sang, 
"We shall overcome." 
</P>
<P>
A consulate employee, peering through a window in one of the office doors, 
refused to respond to the students' demands that he explain his country's 
apartheid policy. 
</P>
<P>
"He stood behind the window, then shut the blinds to us and refused to speak,"

 SKETCHES OF CABBIE SLAYING SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A witness has provided Inglewood police with enough information to develop 
composite sketches of two suspects in last week's slaying of Ami Fhima, the cab 
driver who was robbed and shot an hour after he picked up two men at Los 
Angeles International Airport on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in the area of 111th Street and Van Ness Avenue in Inglewood heard 
shots and saw two suspects rifling the driver's pockets next to the cab, 
officials say. Fhima was shot in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
The composite sketches were distributed by Inglewood police Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are both described as male blacks between 20 and 25 years old. One 
is said to be about 5 feet, 9 or 10 inches tall with a slender build, 
medium-complexion and short hair. The other is described as being about 5 feet, 
6 or 7 inches tall, stocky, light-complexioned and having a thick jeri-curl 
hair style. 
</P>
<P>
Rewards offered by several organizations for information leading to the arrest 
of Fhima's killers total $10,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Fhima, an Israeli immigrant who drove part time for Beverly Hills Cab Co., is 
survived by his wife and two infant sons.

WORLD WAR I MEMENTO IS HANDLED WITH CARE -- BY THE BOMB SQUAD

Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. John Montoya said he was sure Friday 
that he was about to become the object of another firehouse gag when one of his 
men interrupted his morning shower at Station 106 in Rolling Hills Estates to 
announce: "There's a lady in your office and she's got a hand grenade for you." 
</P>
<P>
He had heard jokes like this before, Montoya said later Friday. "The guys kid 
around," Montoya said. "I said to him, 'Yeah, sure. Ha ha ha.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the grenade was no joke. 
</P>
<P>
When Montoya dressed and got to his office, he found Betty Davidson waiting for 
him. The stylish, 67-year-old woman held a tangerine-sized hand grenade. "Don't 
worry," she said with a smile, "I'm not a terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson had been cleaning out her mother's garage in Rancho Palos Verdes on 
Friday, preparing to move her mother into her own home in Rolling Hills. When 
Davidson pried open a trunk containing her late father's World War I 
memorabilia, she found Army Air Corps uniforms, letters and news clippings. 
Then her grandson, John Gentry, 21, discovered the grenade. 
</P>
<P>
"The pin was still in it and we didn't want to take any chances," Davidson said 
later at the fire station. "I drove down here holding it in one hand, because I 
was worried if it rolled around it would go off." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya placed the grenade in an empty yard adjoining the fire station until 
Sheriff's Department bomb squad member Mel Mulleary arrived. Mulleary confirmed 
that the device was, indeed, "a very old-vintage hand grenade." 
</P>
<P>
The grenade appeared to be live, Mulleary said, "with all the fusing mechanism 
together." 
</P>
<P>
It took him about three minutes to defuse the grenade, which will be detonated 
in the next few days at the sheriff's explosives range in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Mulleary said authorities will not know whether the grenade carried a live 
charge until the device is exploded. 
</P>
<P>
As a knot of press photographers took her picture, Davidson was clearly 
tickled, saying, "This almost makes sorting through the garage kind of fun."

BILINGUAL COURT CLERK WINS SETTLEMENT OVER ENGLISH-ONLY ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Claims Board on Friday approved a settlement of $85,000 
to a Latino court clerk who filed a discrimination lawsuit suit saying that 
three Huntington Park Municipal Court judges forced her to speak only in 
English while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys recommended the settlement for Alva Gutierrez, saying the cost 
of defending the lawsuit would far exceed the settlement amount. The case has 
been moving through federal courts for the last four years. Last November, the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld another court's decision that threw 
out the English-only ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement must still be approved by a U.S. District Court judge. 
Gutierrez's attorney, Gloria Allred, said the three judges who issued the order 
to Gutierrez were still opposed to a settlement and wanted to appeal the case 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The claims board award comes nearly five years after Gutierrez filed suit 
against the county after the three judges ordered employees to speak English 
except on breaks and during lunch. The judges said they acted in response to 
complaints from several clerks who said Gutierrez had used insulting remarks 
about them while speaking in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the judges issued their English-only order, Gutierrez went on 
medical leave. After suing the judges, she also filed a separate action with 
the county Civil Service Commission alleging discrimination. The commission 
ruled that the English-only rule violated Civil Service guidelines prohibiting 
discrimination against county employees but stopped short of trying to reverse 
the judges' order. 
</P>
<P>
"From what the attorneys said it seems like it is definitely in the best 
interest of the county to settle," said claims board member Nancy Singer. The 
board approved the settlement 3 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the decision dismissing the English-only rule, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge 
Stephen Reinhardt wrote that such directives "generally have an adverse impact 
on protected groups" and can "create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation 
and intimidation." Reinhardt also ruled that the Municipal Court judges would 
have to answer pretrial questions about their decision to adopt the rule.

DEVELOPER RELENTS, PICKS BLACK TO HEAD MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to mounting criticism by local civil rights groups, developer 
Alexander Haagen has named Leo Ray, a black man, to manage the newly 
refurbished Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, the nation's first enclosed mall 
serving a predominantly black area. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders criticized Haagen for abruptly firing the mall's previous 
manager, Louis George, also black, and replacing him with a management team 
that included Janice Hahn Baucum, daughter of County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, a 
longtime friend of the developer. Baucum is white. 
</P>
<P>
To end the controversy, Haagen broke up the management team, which included 
Baucum and Ray. He promoted Ray, a 37-year-old architect who has worked with 
the developer since 1986, to the position of general manager of the 
$100-million mall. Haagen transferred Baucum to a management marketing position 
at the developer's corporate headquarters in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showcase Mall 
</P>
<P>
Haagen said he decided to promote Ray and transfer Baucum to silence criticism 
by civil rights leaders who accused the developer of not keeping his promise to 
make the mall a showcase for black opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get back to the business of running a first-class regional shopping 
center," he said. "I want it to prosper and to succeed for the retailers and 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
John Mack, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League, praised 
the developer's decision to promote Ray. "I don't know what caused Mr. Haagen's 
turnaround, but it is a big step in the right direction," Mack said.

WOMAN, 85, WHO KILLED SISTER, 86, PLACED ON THREE YEARS' PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 85-year-old woman who beat her older sister to death with a mop received 
three years' probation Friday and was ordered to remain at her retirement home 
under virtual house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Edna Lamont was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the March 12 
bludgeoning death of her sister, Mary McBride, 86. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont told authorities the victim suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a 
degenerative ailment that robs individuals of their mental faculties. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. T. K. Herman called the sentence appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"There was strong evidence that (Lamont) was suffering from the same kind of 
mental dementia that the deceased suffered," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont was not present at her sentencing because of deteriorating health, he 
said, adding that she had completely blocked the slaying from her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas convicted Lamont of involuntary 
manslaughter, based on preliminary hearing transcripts, after a Municipal Court 
judge changed her murder charge to the lesser offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont was ordered not to leave her retirement home without a judge's approval, 
and then only when supervised by a probation officer.

TRIAL OPENS IN KIDNAPING OF BOY LATER FOUND DEAD

<P>
A data processor from San Diego killed a 7-year-old Mountain View, Calif., boy 
at a Stateline gambling resort 14 months ago, a district court jury was told 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Harmon, Clark County chief deputy district attorney, said during opening 
statements in the murder trial of Howard Lee Haupt that he will call witnesses 
who will identify the defendant as the man last seen with the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt, 38, a computer processing analyst, is accused of first-degree murder and 
first-degree kidnaping in the 1987 slaying of Alexander Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The boy vanished during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend from the video arcade 
at Whiskey Pete's Casino in Stateline, 43 miles southwest of Las Vegas near the 
California state line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Body Found 
</P>
<P>
His body was found a month later under a trailer in the resort's employee 
housing area. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense case will prove that this man had nothing whatsoever to do with 
the kidnaping and murder," defense attorney Steve Stein said during his opening 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Stein described Haupt as a stable, quiet, college graduate, who had never been 
arrested or investigated by law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon was expected to argue that a combination of circumstantial, direct and 
medical evidence, coupled with logic, should tell jurors that the person who 
abducted Harris and the person who killed the boy are one and the same. Harmon 
said a casino security department videotape would show the boy leaving the 
arcade with a man who looks like Haupt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Attack Reliability 
</P>
<P>
Stein said he will concentrate a major portion of the defense on attacking the 
reliability of the state's eyewitness identifications. He said the defense 
intends to call at least one identification expert to refute their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will also call as many as four alibi witnesses who will testify that 
Haupt, a member of San Diego's Western Land Yacht Club, was preparing his boat 
for a land sailing competition in the desert outside Stateline about the same 
time Harris vanished from the game room.

28 ROBBERIES IN VALLEY AND WESTSIDE LINKED; $280,000 IS STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bandits believed linked to a series of robberies in which $280,000 in jewelry, 
furs and cash were taken from the drivers of luxury cars struck in Encino and 
Bel-Air on the same night and fired several shots at a victim as she attempted 
to get away, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the two latest incidents on Thursday night. About $38,000 
in cash and valuables were taken from three people in Bel-Air in one of the 
incidents, which police said brings the number of "follow-home" robberies in 
the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles to 28. 
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, a 33-year-old Encino woman foiled a robbery attempt by 
speeding away in her Mercedes-Benz in a hail of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
In the series of robberies that began in mid-October, bandits have followed 
expensive cars, usually Mercedes-Benzes, and confronted the drivers after they 
parked at their homes, police said. Most of the victims were women who were 
driving alone in affluent hillside areas of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers, who police believe are linked but are operating in at least three 
groups, have struck five times since Monday, police said. Only twice has there 
been gunfire, though all of the victims were held up at gunpoint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are showing they are potentially very, very dangerous," Detective 
Steven Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The two latest incidents occurred within 40 minutes of each other, police said. 
And investigators said they believe, based on victims' descriptions, that two 
separate two-man teams were responsible for the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred at 9:30 p.m., when the Encino woman pulled her car 
into the garage of her home in the 15700 block of Greenleaf Street, police 
said. Before the woman could stop her engine, she was confronted by a man with 
a gun, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"She threw the car into reverse and backed out, at which time several shots 
were fired by the suspect," Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's car struck another car parked in the street, but she was able to 
speed away as the gunman fired several more shots at her, Hooks said. None of 
the shots hit the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said that neighbors, who looked outside their homes after hearing the 
gunfire, saw the assailant jump into the passenger seat of a light-blue Mercury 
Merkur and speed away. Police said the same car is believed to have been used 
in several of the robberies. It was also involved in a brief chase a day 
earlier in which it eluded a patrol car on Beverly Glen Boulevard south of 
Ventura Boulevard -- near where five of the robberies have taken place, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 minutes after the robbery attempt Thursday, a husband and wife and an 
elderly woman were robbed at gunpoint after they got out of a Mercedes-Benz in 
front of a home in the 2000 block of Angelo Drive in Bel-Air, Detective Robert 
Tapia said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber had gotten out of the passenger side of a yellow or green car that 
had pulled in behind the victims, Tapia said the victims told police. Jewelry, 
furs and cash were taken from the victims, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the "follow-home" robberies have occurred in the West Los Angeles 
area. Police are investigating whether they are linked to the robberies in the 
Valley, since they were similarly carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley robberies have occurred from Sherman Oaks to Woodland Hills, with 12 
in Encino, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 4, a man was shot and wounded at the door of his Bel-Air home after he 
tried to run from two robbers, police said.

APPEALS COURT WON'T BLOCK NEW METHOD OF COUNTING UNEMPLOYED

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday refused to issue an injunction 
against a statistical procedure that could eventually cost the city of Los 
Angeles and Los Angeles County millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"This will adversely affect us because of the need for job training in Los 
Angeles because of the many homeless," said Fran Bernstein of the Legal Aid 
Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics switched to a less expensive 
method for estimating the number of unemployed in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedure, called the "Handbook method," the long-term unemployed 
would not be included in unemployment statistics used to issue grants under the 
Job Training Partnership Act. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said that although the Bureau uses the Handbook method as opposed to 
the direct-use method in the majority of states, it results in particularly low 
estimates for urban areas, such as Los Angeles County, because of the greater 
number of long-term unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said this would mean an annual loss of $7 million to the county and 
$3.5 million to the city. But Larry Johnson of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Community and Senior Citizens Programs said there was no 
immediate economic impact because the U.S. Department of Labor had restored the 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the new procedure was established to save money after the 
Graham-Rudman Act became law. 
</P>
<P>
In their request for an injunction, the city of Los Angeles and the county said 
Secretary of Labor Ann McLaughlin allowed the Bureau of Labor Statistics to 
change its method of estimating the homeless unilaterally, without notice and 
without allowing opportunity for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no problem now, Johnson noted the federal government's 
financial shape "is not the healthiest" and may need "a shift of resources."

STARR PREFERS TO WATCH, WAIT IN PLANNING NFL FRANCHISE IN BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taking an aggressive posture relative to eventually owning and directing a new 
professional football team in Baltimore isn't in the game plan of former Green 
Bay quarterback Bart Starr. In the parlance of the sport, he and his associates 
are playing it soft. They are waiting and watching before making any kind of a 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Starr and at least one interested partner, John Colbrunn, will be here Monday 
to huddle with the Maryland Sports Advisory Commission. On two previous trips, 
Starr, a much-respected Hall of Fame member, has met with Gov. William Donald 
Schaefer. They've come to know and like each other. 
</P>
<P>
Putting a franchise in Baltimore, if and when the National Football League 
gives the green light for expansion, is of considerable concern to Starr. But 
he's not going to offer anything definitive on the matter. It's all a question 
of timing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are merely sharing information with friends in what we know about the 
possibility of the league eventually adding new teams," Starr said. Then, three 
more times he reiterated the same words: "We are merely sharing information." 
</P>
<P>
But, obviously, Starr and those with him are impressed with Baltimore. "I've 
always felt that way," he said. "I played there enough to know the enthusiasm 
of the people and visited in the off-season to know what it's like. There's an 
electricity that is obvious to an outsider. I have respect for the fans and for 
Baltimore. They deserve a franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed to express a personal thought on where Baltimore would rank while in 
expansion competition with other challengers, such as Oakland, St. Louis, 
Jacksonville and Memphis, he quickly answered: "At the top of the list." 
</P>
<P>
On a visit to Baltimore in mid-June, when he came here at the invitation of a 
friend, Phyllis Brotman, president of Image Dynamics Inc., Starr asked his 
longtime rival on the field and the opponent he admired more than any other, 
fellow Hall of Famer John Unitas, to spend some time with him.

<P>
Again, no promises were made but it's a natural to link Starr and Unitas. Is it 
his hope if Baltimore has a future for Starr that Unitas would be included with 
him? "Very much so," he answered. Then a pause . . . followed by "if we are 
fortunate enough to be selected." 
</P>
<P>
There's no way Starr is going to speak out prematurely, issue bold statements 
or endanger the good will and progress that has been made in what, up to now, 
has been a passive exploration of what is still a nebulous situation. 
</P>
<P>
He did say that in his group, which also includes Tom Stoen, whom he describes 
as "the most honest man I have ever known"; Joe Foss, a World War II Medal of 
Honor winner, later governor of North Dakota and the first commissioner of the 
American Football League; and Willie Davis, a former Packer teammate who is one 
of the most successful black business leaders in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Starr is looking forward to a return to Baltimore. But when asked to talk about 
the franchise possibility, he is cautious and concerned, realizing there's no 
point in offering bold predictions.

<P>
Defending Orange League champion Savanna High School defeated visiting 
Brea-Olinda, 61-55, but the Rebels had to survive a 3-point blitz by Brea in 
the fourth quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna dominated the first three quarters. In the first quarter, the Rebels 
connected on 5 of 12 shots, held Brea to just 2 of 9 shots, and limited 3-point 
specialist Keith Walker, to 2 points to end the quarter leading, 13-4. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna, ranked sixth in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. poll, continued 
to play pressure man-to-man defense and patiently execute its half-court 
offense, taking a 24-17 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
With less than 2 minutes to play in the third quarter, Savanna's fast break 
picked apart Brea's press. The Rebels went on an 8-point run to end the quarter 
with a comfortable 44-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But with 5 minutes remaining and Savanna leading, 55-37, something happened. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda dropped the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Brea began hustling away from its basket to get in 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Brea attempted 16 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 en route to 
outscoring Savanna, 28-17, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough to make the game exciting, but not enough for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
David Dittman's 3-pointer with about 4 minutes to play cut the lead to 15 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who made 3 3-pointers in the quarter, hit 1 with just less than 3 
minutes to play to cut the lead to 55-43. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Chamberlain hit another with 1:20 to play and Marc Shaw's 2 free throws 7 
seconds later reduced the lead to 59-50. 
</P>
<P>
Mustapha Abdi scored on a fast-break layup, but Walker connected from beyond 
the top of the key to make the score, 61-53, with 55 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Brea ran out of ammunition, missing its next 3 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Jimmy Priest, who hit 4 3-point shots in the game, led his team with 
19 points. Abdi added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Walker hit 7 of 21 shots to finish as the game's leading scorer with 24 points. 
Teammate Matt Chamberlain added 12. 
</P>
<P>
"That 3-point shot can bring you back in a hurry and Walker got hot," Savanna 
Coach Tom Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
"They changed the tempo of the ballgame at the end of third quarter, they upped 
the tempo and I don't think we were mentally prepared. We were in a lull." 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia 70, Valencia 55 -- Magnolia outscored Valencia, 22-9, in the fourth 
quarter to improve its record to 8-6, 2-0. Jerry Jones scored 19 points to lead 
the Sentinels. Richard McKee scored 17 and Jason Nester 11. Rudy Lopez led 
Valencia with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Western 80, Anaheim 72 (OT) -- Sam Sabbara scored 18 points to lead visiting 
Western. Jude Barbito made a 3-point play with 22 seconds left in regulation to 
send the game into overtime but Western (11-4, 1-1) outscored Anaheim, 9-1 in 
overtime.

ORANGE LUTHERAN AGAIN DEFEATS WHITTIER CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Upset is a term usually reserved for a victory by an underdog. But to use it 
for Orange Lutheran's 76-68 boys' basketball victory over Olympic League rival 
Whittier Christian Friday at Orange Lutheran would be a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Lancers had lost to the Heralds 10 of the previous 11 games in the 
past 5 seasons. And Whittier Christian has won six consecutive league titles, 
although last season it tied with Orange Lutheran for the championship. But a 
changing of the guard is in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Last season the Lancers won the second of their two games against the Heralds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' improvement has continued. Early this season, they nearly knocked 
off Capistrano Valley and forced Long Beach Wilson to double overtime before 
they lost. Clearly, Orange Lutheran would challenge the Heralds this season. 
</P>
<P>
No surprises then about the two consecutive home victories by the Lancers over 
the Heralds? "No, I'm not surprised," Lancer Coach Jerry Simmons said. 
"Whenever you put 10 basketball players on the court, anything can happen. I 
didn't know we'd gel together like we have." 
</P>
<P>
So does the Lancer victory qualify as an upset? 
</P>
<P>
Said Simmons: "It's not really an upset. (It's) just two good teams that met 
each other and battled back and forth. We just happened to be the one who had 
the most points at the end." 
</P>
<P>
After a 17-17 first quarter, the Lancers built a lead of as much as 7 on Daryl 
Cole's basket with 5 minutes 38 seconds left in the half. Cole, a 6-foot 4-inch 
junior, led the Lancers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran stretched its lead to as many as 13 on three occasions late in 
the third quarter and was up 65-55 in the fourth after a basket by Pat 
Bagatourian (19 points). 
</P>
<P>
"I was real happy we were able to maintain our lead and stop their drives when 
the came back," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds closed to within two twice early in the fourth quarter, but were 
unable to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt right from the beginning of the season they'd be one of the best 
teams in the league," said Bob Brown, first-year Whittier Christian coach. 
"They've proved they are a quality team." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, rated No.2 in the Southern Section 2-A, improved their record to 
12-3 overall and 5-0 in league play. Whittier Christian is 10-4, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario Christian 59, Santa Margarita 58 (OT) -- Mike Guevara made a 3-pointer 
to tie the score, 55-55, with about a minute left in regulation for Santa 
Margarita (5-8, 0-4), but the Eagles missed a shot as time ran out in overtime. 
Freshman Dan Bathey had 19 points and Jeff Layne 15 for Santa Margarita. DENNIS

SANTA ANA'S SURPRISE STAR COMES THROUGH IN CLUTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final play in Santa Ana High School's last-second 64-62 victory over rival 
Santa Ana Valley Friday went nearly as designed, but the wrong player made the 
winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
Billie Johnson, a reserve guard, appeared to be just as stunned as Santa Ana 
Valley when he made a 17-foot jump shot with 1 second remaining that moved 
Santa Ana (14-5, 2-1) into a first-place tie with Santa Ana Valley and El 
Modena in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
The designated game-winner was supposed to be Chauncy Woolridge, Santa Ana's 
talented 6-foot 5-inch sophomore. A screen was set near the top of the key, and 
Johnson was all set to pass to Woolridge with a couple of seconds remaining and 
the score tied, 62-62. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Johnson found the passing lane full with two defenders covering 
Woolridge, so he dribbled a couple of feet to his left and launched the shot 
that hit nothing but net as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Give Billie the credit, he saw that the play wasn't going to develop and took 
it upon himself to go ahead and take the shot," said Greg Coombs, Santa Ana 
coach. "It was a heads-up play." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley (10-6, 2-1) had gained the momentum in an emotional game when 
Brian Singleton made a pair of 3-point shots and guard Chuck Steen hit a 
baseline jump shot in the final 1:34 of play that tied the score, 62-62. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to win the game," said Jeff Bishop, Santa Ana Valley 
coach. "What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
Bishop did have something to say about the disparity in fouls called on the 
teams. Santa Ana Valley was assessed 23 team fouls; Santa Ana had 9. Santa Ana 
didn't commit its first foul in the second half until 2:15 remained in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We play an aggressive, full-court pressure style of basketball, and that was 
taken away tonight by the officiating," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Santa Ana managed to make only 6 of 15 free throws in the second half 
and 3-point specialist Mike Zamora never connected on his favorite shot despite 
scoring a game-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't complain about the free throws," Coombs said. "In this gym with three 
sophomores out there, you can never feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley was vying for its first victory over Santa Ana since 1981, the 
last time the Falcons have won a league title. Guard Chuck Steen led Santa Ana 
Valley with 22 points and teammate Brian Singleton added 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Santa Ana Valley showed it's ready to play with the league's 
best teams in Bishop's third year. It wasn't always that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember my first day of practice here," Bishop said. "It was time 
to start and only three players had showed up. Finally, about 45 minutes later, 
they showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked one of them where they'd been, and he told me, 'Chill out, coach. 
We'll practice, just chill out.' " 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 67, Foothill 56 -- Robbie Pietsch scored 28 points -- including 14 in 
the second quarter -- and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead El Modena (13-5, 2-1) at 
Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena opened a 15-9 lead in the first quarter, and led 33-21 at halftime. 
Foothill (9-8, 1-2) rallied to pull within 6 points in the last quarter. Todd 
Henrotin scored 18 points and teammate Greg Gottlieb 15 points, including 3 
3-point shots in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 60, Villa Park 41 -- John Hutchinson scored 15 points and Abdi 
Barkhordar added 14 points to lead to give Canyon (11-7, 1-2) its first league 
victory. Chris Johnson scored 11 points for Villa Park (9-8, 1-2).

came back to send the game into overtime and upset Kennedy, 37-35, Friday in a 
Garden Grove League boys' basketball game at Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Chuck York, Garden Grove's first substitution of the game, went 
in with 6 minutes remaining and hit 2 3-point shots, the second one to tie the

shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Brian Tran hit a driving jump shot with 4 seconds remaining in 
overtime to give the Argonauts (3-11 overall, 2-3 in league play) the victory

</P>
<P>
In overtime, Kennedy won the tip and Tom Deep went to the line for a 1-and-1 
with 2:48 remaining. He missed the first shot and Garden Grove, which played a 
delay game throughout, worked the ball to set up Tran's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's Joe Squyres, a junior, led all scorers with 15 points and hit 5 
of 6 free throws in the fourth quarter.

WHOLESALE PRICES CLIMB 4% IN 1988, THE HIGHEST ANNUAL RATE OF INFLATION IN 8 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wholesale prices rose by 0.4% in December as inflation at the wholesale level 
hit 4% for 1988, the highest annual pace in eight years, the Labor Department 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The government report showed wholesale prices ending the year on an 
accelerating trend. The broad range of increases in goods, while not unexpected 
by the financial markets, was greeted as an ominous sign by experts fearful of 
a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"Pressure is clearly growing," said Bruce Steinberg of the Merrill Lynch 
investment firm in New York. "You can still see signs of more increases in 
basic metal prices and industrial materials and not much sign of moderation. 
There's plenty more reason here for the Fed to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the Federal Reserve soon may be prompted to push up 
interest rates to curb an inflationary spiral and keep the economy from 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices were virtually unchanged for the fourth month in a row, while 
energy prices, normally volatile, increased only slightly. But prices for most 
other finished goods were on an upward march and prices for all items other 
than food and energy in December advanced by a relatively steep 0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"If the core rate, without food and energy, is up to 0.6% in a month, that's 
worrying," said Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern of increases for the year as a whole was similar to December's. 
Excluding food and energy, wholesale price inflation in 1988 was 4.3%, while 
all intermediate goods -- such as industrial materials and partly finished 
components of consumer goods, leaped ahead 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
All these yearly statistics point to higher inflation in 1989 at both the 
wholesale level and the consumer price level, which in turn could force an 
upward ratchet on wages as well. The 4% increase in wholesale prices was the 
biggest December-to-December jump since a much steeper 7.1% increase in 1981, 
when the high inflation of the 1970s was still dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors, 
found little cause for optimism in the December statistics. 
</P>
<P>
He hailed as "good news" the relative stability in food and energy prices. But, 
in a statement, he warned that the soaring prices of commodities and industrial 
materials "should exert inflationary pressure on the index as these goods work 
their way to the consumer in the months ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Prices of crude goods, while up only 2.8% for the year, jumped 3.5% in December 
after a 3.1% decline in November. Copper and aluminum scrap jumped a steep 5.6% 
and 2.2% respectively in December, and both advanced just over 20% for the 
year. In addition, industrial materials fabricated from those crude commodities 
moved upward in similarly large steps. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine there are some furrowed brows at the Fed regarding these numbers," 
Van Dongen said. "They point to a need to carefully monitor demand in the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Economists said, however, that concern should not yet turn into panic. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, 
which tracks price movements, said that there is still no sign of 1970s-style 
inflation on the horizon. He said aluminum, copper and industrial chemicals 
prices should level off, allowing wholesale prices to rise to perhaps 4.5% in 
1989, but not much higher. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, David Wyss of Data Resources, Inc., in Lexington, Mass., said that 
he expects the economy to slow by spring, further moderating inflation. He, 
too, projected 4.5% wholesale inflation this year and consumer price inflation 
at about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that energy prices probably will move upward only gradually, 
though demand in the United States is beginning to accelerate faster than 
industrial output. 
</P>
<P>
The December increase in wholesale prices left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 110.0, an increase of 0.3 point over the previous month. In 
other words, a hypothetical cross-section of goods costing $100 in 1982 would 
have cost $110 last month, 30 cents more than in November. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate economic report Friday, the Commerce Department said that retail 
sales grew by a strong 6.7% in 1988, the biggest rate of increase in four 
years, in a brisk recovery from the temporary buyers' slowdown that followed 
the 1987 stock market crash.

FLYING SCARED; 
</P>
<P>
FLIGHT CREWS INCREASINGLY WANT TO KNOW: HAS THIS PLANE BEEN THREATENED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fear of flying has grown since the bombing of Pan American World Airways' 
Flight 103 on Dec. 21, especially among flight crews, and interviews indicate 
that many of those who fly for a living are dejected and uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the fear and unhappiness, there is intensified debate over whether 
airlines should tell crews and passengers about such sabotage threats and, if 
so, how much. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a group of jittery United Airlines flight attendants took 
matters into their own hands. They were responding to a threat phoned to the 
U.S. Embassy in Oslo saying that a U.S. airliner flying between New York and 
Los Angeles would be sabotaged Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining that United did not give them sufficient information about the 
threat, seven members of the cabin crew refused to fly a Los Angeles-bound 
flight on that day. As a consequence, the flight had to be canceled, but the 
threat turned out to be unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Although no other such cases have been reported, flight attendants generally 
have been more cautious -- and more fearful -- than in the past. For instance, 
some say they that while they used to be somewhat careless with their 
hand-carried baggage, now they never let it out of their sight in airports. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the psychological state of Pan Am flight attendants, 
especially those at the London base, from which the 13 attendants on Pan Am 103 
came, has been the most affected. As a result, Pan Am has offered counseling to 
attendants who feel that they need it and has allowed attendants who get cold 
feet at the last minute to walk away from a flight. 
</P>
<P>
And some passengers are becoming militant. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the ill-fated Pan Am flight, Alan M. Dershowitz, a well-known 
Harvard University law professor, was on a Pan Am shuttle destined for New York 
from Boston. After the plane began to taxi for takeoff, it was surrounded by 
police, who boarded it and escorted a group of men off the aircraft. It turned 
out that one was a former Mexican presidential candidate against whom there had 
been a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Once the group had left the plane, Dershowitz wrote later in a newspaper 
column, Pan Am planned to continue the flight with the remaining passengers. 
However, when Dershowitz learned the reason for the group's leaving the plane, 
he felt that the threat against the Mexican was in effect the same as one 
against himself, since they were riding on the same plane. 
</P>
<P>
So he used the cellular telephone he was carrying to call police, who ordered 
the plane back to the gate and allowed passengers who wanted to get off to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no doubt that nervousness about flying is at a peak. 
</P>
<P>
In the New York City suburb of Harrison, for example, the school district has 
canceled all school-sponsored trips overseas by student groups until further 
notice. The school board's ruling means that a planned student trip to France 
next month will not occur. Among the 259 passengers on Pan Am 103 was a 1985 
graduate of Harrison High School. 
</P>
<P>
"People are anxious," said Homer Boynton, head of security for American 
Airlines. "Even I am anxious when I get on a plane." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a variety of opinions on whether -- or how much -- flight crews 
and passengers should be told about threats of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
Some pilot groups, flight attendant unions and passenger organizations side 
with the United cabin crew. They complain that they are not being kept properly 
informed and insist that they should be told of all threats -- even those that 
police and airline managers do not take seriously. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Creates a Lot of Stress' 
</P>
<P>
But frequently such groups concede that if flight crews, and especially the 
public, are informed about every episode there would be unnecessary and 
unwarranted fear and concern and that the nation's airline flight system could 
be brought to a standstill. They maintain that each case should be evaluated by 
airline and security experts, with crews and the public being informed only in 
clearly dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes experts and numerous pieces of intelligence to determine a danger," 
said Luke Bradley, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Assn.'s flight security 
committee and a pilot for Pan Am. 
</P>
<P>
Flight crew unions generally agree that serious threats must be sifted from the 
phony ones and that crews are in no position to do so. "Somebody else has to 
cull that out," said Tom Lambert, president of the Pan Am chapter of the Flight 
Engineers International Assn. "If every threat of a bomb were treated in the 
same manner without determining if it was a hoax, the planes would stop." 
</P>
<P>
Carla Winkler, president of Continental Airlines' Union of Flight Attendants, 
said she has "mixed feelings" about being informed about threats. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates a lot of stress to have to worry about that aspect on a trip," she 
said. On the other hand, she added, "it makes flight crews more aware and more 
conscious and makes them a bit more alert. We could live with procedures where 
we would not have to know about every threat so long as we know there is a 
competent investigating team looking into the legitimacy of the threat." 
</P>
<P>
Airline Passengers of America, a consumer advocacy group, wants passengers to 
be warned when the government believes that the danger is sufficient to notify 
its agencies and embassies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the Pan Am threat, the government should not have discriminated 
between who was told and who was not," said David Jeffrey, the group's manager 
of member services and public affairs. "The general public should have been 
told." 
</P>
<P>
Most airlines will not discuss any specific aspects of security. But a few that 
did gave some clues as to what they believe passengers and flight crews should 
be told. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evaluating Threats 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines sometimes keeps its crews in the dark about threats it does 
not take seriously. Boynton notes that in the last decade there were 15,000 
bomb threats against U.S. airlines and that virtually none were serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these threats," he said, "come from people with aberrant behavior, 
demented persons or people who are going to be late for their planes and want 
to delay it -- which does not work. If you give credence to every one of these 
threats and if you hold up every plane, it would be hard to run an airline." 
</P>
<P>
The procedures airlines and government agencies use to evaluate threats have 
grown more sophisticated in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past there used to a knee-jerk response to any and every threat. Every 
one was considered serious, without discrimination," said Richard Lally, vice 
president-security of the Air Transport Assn., the airline industry trade 
group. "Each case was handled in the same way even though it was recognized 
that some were no more (serious) than when kids call the local tobacco store to 
ask if it has Prince Albert in a can." 
</P>
<P>
But in the last few years, he added, a system has been adopted in which certain 
criteria are applied to evaluate threats. "The hoaxes are screened out so there 
can be an adequate response to the serious threats." 
</P>
<P>
Said Boynton: "We have certain indicators. . . . If these indicators are not in 
the threat, then we declare it an indefinite threat, and we do not tell the 
crew." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, according to a spokeswoman for its flight attendants union, the 
Independent Union of Flight Attendants, also has different levels of alert. 
"The lowest is the nut call," she said. "And it becomes more serious from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The airlines, of course, will not disclose the nature of the way they judge the 
seriousness of threats. 
</P>
<P>
When there is a serious-sounding threat while an airliner is aloft, Boynton 
said, American will not tell its passengers about it until the plane has 
landed. "We don't want to have a bunch of hysterical people at 31,000 feet," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Airlines takes a different approach. It levels with crew and passengers 
whenever there is any threat of sabotage (though it also waits for a plane to 
land before making any announcement). "We have to treat everything as if it is 
a real thing," said Delta spokesman William Berry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that we need to keep everybody in the loop to keep the rumor 
mill down," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Publicity Not Helpful 
</P>
<P>
Delta says that in the two-week period since the Pan Am bombing the number of 
bomb threats it receives has doubled. Even a fast search, Berry said, takes two 
to three hours, and a bomb threat, causing the delay of one flight, 
reverberates throughout Delta's nationwide route system for the rest of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity is not helpful, most airline officials believe. Media attention, said 
Berry, breeds additional threats. Recently, he recalled, there was a bomb scare 
on one of Delta's planes. The airline was not able to persuade a local 
television station not to report the incident, and within two hours after the 
broadcast there were two more threatening calls. 
</P>
<P>
While some flight labor organizations say that crews do not need to know about 
every hoax bomb threat, others feel that their members are not being told 
enough. The Eastern Airline pilots local, for example, is feuding with the 
carrier over what constitutes a direct threat against a specific flight and 
about which it must be informed. Such threats are labeled "positive target 
identifications," as opposed to what is simply a general threat. 
</P>
<P>
The union maintains that the airline does not believe that a threat that 
includes the number of a plane or the number of a flight is enough to 
constitute a PTI. The airline, according to the union, says such information is 
readily available to anyone looking at the tail of a plane or at an airport 
monitor screen and that crews do not have to be informed. 
</P>
<P>
An Eastern spokesman, however, said the airline's procedures are "much more 
refined" than that and show "a far greater concern for the public safety." He 
would not give details of Eastern's procedures in the face of bomb threats, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am's flight attendants have an informal agreement with the airline that 
crews be told about sabotage threats, a flight attendants union spokeswoman 
said. But it is not a contractual agreement, and the union is urging the 
government to make divulging such information to crews mandatory.

TELEDYNE ELECTRONICS, 6 PEOPLE PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A unit of Teledyne, three of its vice presidents, a Navy official and two 
defense consultants pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges filed against them 
in a 27-count indictment stemming from the government's massive investigation 
of defense procurement fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge set March 27 as the date for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The government has charged that Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., 
hired William L. Parkin, a Washington-area defense consultant, to get 
information about a $100-million contract from the Navy and Air Force for 
equipment used in checking radar sets. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin, according to the indictment, then paid a second consultant, Fred H. 
Lackner of Woodland Hills, to bribe his friend, Stuart E. Berlin, the Navy 
official charged in the case. Teledyne subsequently obtained the contract in 
part because of the confidential information Berlin passed along, prosecutors 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin, a civilian purchasing expert for the Navy, has now been suspended 
without pay from his $74,304-a-year job. Teledyne Electronics has been barred 
from doing business with any federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, all of whom were released on $10,000 personal recognizance 
bonds, proclaimed their innocence Friday. Parkin, leaving the court disguised 
in a beard and cap, muttered, "I'm going to be exonerated," to reporters who 
caught up with him before he sprinted away to avoid questions. Berlin, when 
asked if he expected to be acquitted, said simply: "Sure do." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Williams to delay the 
trial until late April, saying that the government plans to use scores of 
wiretaps and a "warehouse of documents." The defense has "a daunting task in 
front of us," Teledyne attorney Thomas Patten told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Face Fines of $6.5 Million 
</P>
<P>
Williams, however, rejected the request, saying that the accusations concern 
"garden-variety crimes." 
</P>
<P>
The company potentially faces fines up to $6.5 million if convicted of all 
counts in the indictment. Teledyne's lawyers insist that the company did 
nothing wrong and had no knowledge of any private deals among the consultants 
and government employees. 
</P>
<P>
Patten said Friday that he would press for a separate trial for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Another defense contractor, Hazeltine Corp., two of its former officers and a 
former Washington marketing official for Teledyne last week pleaded guilty to 
charges stemming from the same investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Hazeltine case involves charges that the company also hired consultant 
Parkin to get confidential information to assist it in bidding on a 
$15.9-million contract for electronic testing equipment used in aircraft. 
Hazeltine also has been suspended from bidding on government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The former Teledyne official, Michael Savaides, is expected to be a major 
witness in the government's case against his former employers. He is not 
scheduled to be sentenced until April 28. The two former Hazeltine executives 
who pleaded guilty along with him are expected to be sentenced in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, further indictments are expected as the government continues to 
build its case from the huge 2 1/2-year "Ill Wind" investigation.

EX-MANPOWER CHIEF TO HEAD PARENT FIRM

<P>
Mitchell Fromstein, ousted last month as head of the employment group Manpower 
Inc. by its British parent Blue Arrow PLC, emerged victorious in a coup Friday 
to become the new chief executive of the entire group. 
</P>
<P>
The board of Blue Arrow announced that Fromstein would take over from Tony 
Berry as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
In the board room struggle, Fromstein, 62, was forced to resign last month as 
head of Milwaukee-based Manpower, a giant temporary recruitment agency he 
helped build. 
</P>
<P>
But that led to a campaign by U.S. holders of Manpower agency franchises to 
have him reinstated. The group approved a resolution of "no confidence" in the 
replacement management brought in by London-based Blue Arrow. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, 46, a schoolboy boxer who became one of Britain's most dashing 
entrepreneurs, remains chairman of the board but is no longer chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Some financial analysts said Berry's ouster was due partly to a poor 
stock-price performance after Blue Arrow's 1987 takeover of Manpower, and to 
controversy over the flop of a $685-million (387-million pound) stock flotation 
to help finance the $1.34-billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's board statement said the decision to move Fromstein to Blue Arrow to 
replace Berry as chief executive resulted from differences between directors on 
management style. 
</P>
<P>
The Manpower franchise holders said in a statement from Chicago that they were 
pleased with the change in management. The group said although it was never its 
goal to replace Berry with any specific individual, "we welcome the news that 
Mitchell Fromstein will assume leadership of the company." 
</P>
<P>
They said the appointment is clearly in "the best long-term interest of 
Manpower, its employees, customers and franchisees as well as Blue Arrow and 
its shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Under Berry 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said Berry had felt that Fromstein was interfering with his 
plans to integrate and rationalize the group. But Fromstein had given Manpower 
eight years of solid profits growth and two-thirds of group profits came from 
operations that Fromstein controlled, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this must be seen as a great relief in that it clears the air," said 
Mark Shephard of brokers Phillips &amp; Drew. "There had been intense 
speculation as to what is going on, a lot of unpleasant rumors of bids, 
breakouts, buyouts and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hardman of brokers James Capel said: "Berry's staying on as non-executive 
chairman means that everybody knows where they stand. Fromstein is certainly in 
the driving seat and a management buyout is no longer a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Under Berry, Blue Arrow enjoyed spectacular growth, with profits rising from 
about $725,000 (410,000 pounds) in 1984 to almost $55 million (30 million 
pounds) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It made a series of British takeovers, and then moved onto the global stage in 
1987 to win Manpower. But the stock issue to help pay for that deal coincided 
with the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry is investigating Blue Arrow's former 
investment bank adviser, County Natwest, over an alleged stock-price support 
operation following the failure of the stock flotation. 
</P>
<P>
Berry has said he did not know of County Natwest's actions at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's share holding in Blue Arrow amounts to about 2% of the company and is 
worth an estimated $22.5 million (12.7 million pounds) at the current market 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Arrow is this month expected to announce its results for the year to 
October, 1988.

CHINA SET TO PAY HIGH COSTS TO CUT INFLATION 
</P>

<P>
China is prepared to accept sharply reduced economic growth and increased 
unemployment in 1989 in a bid to reduce inflation, which was 26% last year, a 
government spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The government is aiming this year for an increase of 7.5% in the gross 
national product, after a rise of 11.2% last year, State Council spokesman Yuan 
Mu said at a news conference. (The State Council is China's equivalent of a 
Cabinet.) 
</P>
<P>
The lower rate is to be achieved largely by holding the growth of industrial 
production to 8%, down from 17.7% last year, and by a 22% reduction in 
investment in fixed assets, Yuan said. This is likely to cause unemployment to 
rise to about 3%, up from 2% in 1988, he said. Social security programs will 
ensure that the livelihood of unemployed workers is assured, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-inflation measures announced in September have had some effect, Yuan said. 
Inflation peaked in October, when prices were 27.1% higher than in October, 
1987, and has decreased slightly since then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Agriculture Investment 
</P>
<P>
"Although the masses are still unsatisfied with the price increases, they 
complain less about the situation," Yuan said. "The panic-buying that occurred 
in various parts of China last year has subsided." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the 12-month period ending Dec. 31, 1988, rose by 26%, Yuan said, 
adding that the government hopes to reduce inflation by about 3 to 5 percentage 
points this year. The government wants a clearly visible, but not too drastic, 
reduction in inflation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much haste in this regard would not help our economic development," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although China seeks to slow its overheated industrial growth in order to ease 
bottlenecks in raw material supply, energy and transportation, and thus help 
reduce inflation, investment in agriculture will be increased, Yuan said. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural output, which grew 3% in 1988, is targeted to rise 4% this year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1988 stood at $18 billion, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan denied that China plans to devalue its currency. He acknowledged, however, 
that the Foreign Enterprise Service Corp., or FESCO, in Beijing, a 
government-run company through which foreign firms are required to obtain most 
of their local workers, recently demanded that the fees it charges for its 
personnel be pegged to foreign currency rather than to Chinese yuan. 
</P>
<P>
This would have meant that the amount in yuan paid to FESCO in return for its 
provision of Chinese workers would have gone up sharply in response to any 
devaluation of China's currency. The demand was widely viewed by foreigners in 
Beijing as an indication that the government expected to devalue the currency 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan said Friday that FESCO had made the demand without proper authorization, 
that it was wrong to do so, and that the demand "has now been canceled."

It's a great time for savers, with short-term interest rates at or above their 
highest levels in years. One of the best ways to take advantage of this is 
through mutual funds that invest in short- and intermediate-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to their relative convenience, safety and potential for higher returns 
than money market mutual funds and bank savings accounts, these funds have 
grown in number and popularity in recent years. Conservative investors also 
like them because they are less volatile than funds investing in long-term 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
These funds generally invest in fixed-income securities, such as U.S. Treasury 
issues or corporate bonds, with maturities of less than 10 years. Many are 
currently yielding 9% or more, topping the averages of 8.63% on money market 
mutual funds, 8.51% on one-year certificates of deposit and 6.24% on bank money 
market deposit accounts. 
</P>
<P>
If interest rates rise, however, the total return you will earn -- yield plus 
or minus changes in bond values -- can be eroded. That's because the prices of 
already-issued bonds fall when interest rates rise. That happened last year, 
when rising interest rates pushed average total returns on 
short-to-intermediate bond funds down to 6.51%, compared to 7% for money market 
mutual funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services, a Summit, N.J., firm 
that tracks fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
But such risks are well worth taking, particularly now that short-term interest 
rates have run up so high already. Yields on two-year Treasury notes, for 
example, have hit 9.2%. That tops 9% yields on 30-year Treasuries -- which 
normally yield more than short-term issues. 
</P>
<P>
If interest rates stay at these levels or fall, total returns may be higher. 
And there is virtually no chance that returns can actually be negative if 
interest rates rise further. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk-reward relationship is very good," says Donald J. Phillips, editor of 
Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago-based advisory service. 
</P>
<P>
The funds also offer advantages over investing directly in Treasuries issues. 
Treasury bills, with maturities of between three months and one year, require 
$10,000 minimum investments and are often a hassle to buy and sell before 
maturity. Treasury notes, with maturities of one to 10 years, require minimum 
$5,000 investments for maturities of four years or less. Likewise, buying and 
selling them can be a hassle. 
</P>
<P>
But funds usually require lower minimum investments and are relatively easy to 
buy and sell. And many fund families offer the ability for you to switch your 
money into other stock or bond funds in that family. That switching feature 
could come in handy, because if interest rates start falling, you might want to 
switch into longer-term funds to lock in high yields and take advantage of 
price rises in long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
How should you go about picking the right fund? 
</P>
<P>
Several factors are important to consider. Of course, you need to examine 
current yields and long-term performance -- information available over the 
phone, in quarterly or annual reports, or through various investment advisory 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important are sales charges and expenses. Look for funds with no sales 
charges, or "loads," and with low annual expenses, such as those offered by 
Vanguard Group. High loads and expenses can wipe out much of your return. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets hard to justify paying loads for short-term funds when money market 
funds are available with no loads," analyst Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
Also, funds with higher asset levels tend to enjoy lower expense ratios, says 
Sheldon Jacobs, editor and publisher of No-Load Fund Investor, a 
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you may want to pick a fund in a group such as Fidelity, Vanguard or T. 
Rowe Price that has many other stock and bond funds that you can switch into if 
conditions merit. 
</P>
<P>
What funds do experts pick? 
</P>
<P>
Phillips of Mutual Fund Values likes three short-term funds: Vanguard Fixed 
Income -- Short-Term Bond Fund (800-662-7447), with a current 30-day yield of 
9.14%; T. Rowe Price Short-Term Bond Fund (800-638-5660), with a current 30-day 
yield of 8.51%, and Neuberger &amp; Berman Limited Maturity (800-367-0770), 
with a current 30-day yield of 8.67%. 
</P>
<P>
Among intermediate-term funds, Phillips favors Fidelity Intermediate-Term Bond 
Fund (800-544-6666), with a current 30-day yield of 8.72%, and Babson Bond 
Trust (800-422-2766), with a current 30-day yield of 9.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also recommends Strong Income (800-368-3863), a fund that can switch 
from short-term bonds into longer-term issues when it thinks conditions warrant 
such a move. The fund also invests in higher-yielding "junk bonds" and 
high-dividend stocks. Its current 30-day yield is 10.52%. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in a high tax bracket, consider short- or intermediate-term municipal 
bond funds, which are exempt from federal taxes and possibly state and local 
taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
Among intermediate-term muni funds, newsletter editor Jacobs recommends 
Fidelity Limited-Term Muni (800-544-6666), with a current 30-day yield of 
6.33%, and Vanguard Muni -- Intermediate Term (800-662-7447), with a current 
7-day yield of 6.97%.

30TH YEAR FOR 'FRIENDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fullerton Friends of Music is celebrating its 30th year of sponsoring 
professional chamber music concerts, making it the oldest such organization in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
It is supported primarily by member subscriptions and has maintained a policy 
of admission-free concerts since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Its artistic level is splendid. In addition to the best Southern California 
artists, the series presents international musicians. As an example, the 
current season opened with the Talich String Quartet and will continue with, 
among others, harpsichordist Igor Kipnis and lutanist James Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for its coverage of cultural activities -- 
coverage that has done much to rectify the view that Orange County is a 
cultural wasteland. We look forward to being a part of your reportage.

ARTS CENTER SHOULD BOOK NEW TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Andy Kaufman's tribute/parody should have buried the others-as-Elvis 
shtick forever, so the Orange County Performing Arts Center's (coming) "Elvis: 
A Musical Celebration," featuring three actor versions of the King, is an 
unnecessary and puzzling presentation. 
</P>
<P>
By digging up the bloated corpse of Elvis while ignoring the vital 
contributions of living contemporary musicians, the "Arts Center" reveals 
itself to be nothing but cold concrete anchored in mud. 
</P>
<P>
Only an inventive, diverse booking policy recognizing fine talents such as 
Celia Cruz, John Lee Hooker, Public Enemy, Yellowman, 3 Mustaphas 3, Eddie 
Palmieri, Kassav, B-H Surfers, Dwight Yoakam, Black Stalin, Flaco Jimenez, 
Jane's Addiction, Alpha Blondie, Pancho Sanchez, and Beausoleil -- to name a 
few -- will bring much-needed credibility (and patrons) to the Center.

Caltrans' division of aeronautics has established guidelines to control the 
amount of noise generated over residential areas by aircraft using the state's 
airports. Under those guidelines, any area exposed to an average Community 
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) of more than 65 in a year is considered to be 
noise-impacted. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with those regulations, John Wayne airport has set up nine stations 
at locations in Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Tustin to monitor noise levels. 
Some stations are on private property and others on public land, at the 
following locations: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
M-1: 2139 Anniversary Lane, Newport Beach

</P>
<P>
M-3: 2601 Vista del Oro, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
M-5: 17952 Beneta Way, Tustin 
</P>

</P>
<P>
M-7: 20181 SW. Birch St., Santa Ana

</P>
<P>
M-9: 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-10: Golf Course, 3100 Irvine Ave., Newport Beach.* 
</P>
<P>
The stations monitor the noise levels on a daily basis. The average daily 
levels, which are also averaged for each month, are "the result of a computer 
analysis based on county-provided data including flight tracks, actual traffic 
counts, average SENELs (Single Event Noise Exposure Levels) by aircraft model 
and recorded CNEL values for each monitor station," according to the quarterly 
report from the airport's Noise Abatement Office.

As of the end of June, a total of 42 homes in Newport Beach and Santa Ana 
Heights are in a noise-impacted area. The state has several remedies for 
property owners in the area: the homes can be insulated, they can be purchased 
by the county, or the sites can be re-zoned for "other non-noise sensitive 
uses," according to Lynn Dosheery, a county planner who serves as the Santa Ana 
Heights project manager. For instance, the zoning in the area along Acacia and 
Birch streets in Santa Ana Heights has been changed from a general agricultural 
use to a business park, she said.

The airport's Noise Abatement Office logs noise complaints from local citizens. 
During the second quarter of 1988, the office received a total of 650 noise 
complaints from local citizens. This represents a 4% decrease from the number 
of complaints received the previous quarter but a 129% increase over the number 
of complaints logged in the second quarter of 1987. According to airport 
spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford, residents in the Balboa area made "a concerted 
effort" to call in their noise complaints.

3 SKINHEADS GET MAXIMUM FOR 'GAY-BASHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge in Santa Ana on Friday handed three young neo-Nazi skinheads the 
maximum possible sentences in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in a Laguna Beach 
park last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing the three of a "wolf pack" mentality, Superior Court Judge David H. 
Brickner sentenced Aaron F. Compean, 18, who assaulted the victim with a lead 
pipe, to 7 years in prison. John M. Moore, 23, was sentenced to 4 years and 8 
months for assault and attempted robbery, and Stephen Walther, 18, was 
sentenced to 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, all from Huntington Beach, attacked 48-year-old Robert Joyce as 
he walked along the edge of the coastal cliffs in Heisler Park on July 15, 
1988. Despite that, the jury that convicted them of assault 2 months ago 
rejected prosecutors' allegations that the crime was attempted murder, which 
could have carried a 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's sentencing hearing, defense attorneys argued that the men were 
extremely remorseful and asked the judge for less than the maximum sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Compean's attorney, Gene E. Dorney, told the court that in his talks with 
Compean, "I see a glimmering of understanding of what he did to another human 
being, and a softening of the heart not only toward homosexuals, but others." 
</P>
<P>
Walther's attorney, James S. Sweeney, argued that his client "now recognizes 
that random violence, even in a drunken state, is not something the courts can 
tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said he found the crime "especially offensive because of its 
wolf-pack modus operandi . . . beating (the victim) seriously for no 
comprehensible reason." Brickner told the three, "It's not your politics that's 
being punished here; it's your behavior." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsuspecting Victim 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the victim was "middle-aged, unarmed, alone, unsuspecting, in 
the dark . . . and doing nothing more than simply minding his own business." 
</P>
<P>
Compean's attorney asked the judge to consider that Compean was the only one of 
the three not wearing steel-pointed shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to," Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef told the court. "He was 
the one with the pipe." 
</P>
<P>
Walther, in an interview at Orange County Jail after his conviction, said the 
three went to the park after a night of heavy drinking. Compean, Moore and 
Walther have admitted attacking two men in the park before Joyce was attacked. 
But those crimes were not brought to trial because one of the victims now lives 
out of state, and was unavailable to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce was knocked unconscious and required 70 stitches to his head and body. He 
identified all three of his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attack Admitted 
</P>
<P>
In statements to a probation officer, the three defendants admitted attacking 
Joyce but denied that they went to the park to attack gays. The judge, however, 
said in court that he believed that was why they took the lead pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Included in court papers was a letter to the judge by the girlfriend of Moore's 
father, who wrote of Moore: 
</P>
<P>
"He is a time bomb of disappointments and unhappiness ready to explode. . . . 
It is my heartfelt fear that if he walks away from this without paying some 
sort of retribution, and without professional help . . . he may very well vent 
his anger in some other malicious way." 
</P>
<P>
Also noted at the sentencing hearing was a letter Walther had written from 
Orange County Jail in October just before his trial. It was filled with racial 
epithets and a drawing of a skinhead and the words: "Sieg Heil" and 
"Screwdriver Skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
The skinhead movement, which espouses a virulent hatred of homosexuals and 
non-whites, finds it roots in the music of British heavy metal bands like 
Screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, Sweeney said his client, Walther, was not upset about 
receiving the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"His comment to me was: 'The system works,' " Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Walther's mother, Barbara Walther, said she thought that it had been a fair 
trial and that the judge was a fair man. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my son got what's coming to him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Avdeef called it "a political type of statement to (the 
defendants)). . . . These individuals are like a cancer: You have to remove 
(them) from society." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, the first elected official in Orange 
County to openly declare he is gay, said Friday that he believes that the 
judge's strong sentences send "an extremely positive signal to the gay 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Compean and Walther could have been eligible to serve their sentences at the 
California Youth Authority. Their attorneys said, however, that both wanted to 
go to state prison. Brickner said that was exactly where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney explained later that his client did not want to go to the Youth 
Authority because it had too many "blacks and other minorities." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they figure if they go to state prison they can get into the Aryan 
Brotherhood," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aryan Brotherhood is a white-racist prison organization.

COUPLE INJURED, 4 CATS DIE IN APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A husband and wife suffered smoke inhalation and their four cats died in an 
early morning fire Friday at an apartment complex in the 1400 block of East 
Grove Avenue, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 6 a.m., according to Richard Alarcon, an 
investigator for the Orange Fire Department. Alarcon said the residents of an 
upstairs apartment, Saundra and Joseph Lojacono, suffered smoke inhalation and 
were treated and released at St. Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was apparently started by a portable heater in the Lojaconos' 
apartment, Alarcon said. There was some water damage to a lower apartment, but 
fire damage was confined to the Lojaconos' residence. Alarcon estimated $50,000 
total damage to apartments and contents.

$646,668 CHECK GOES TO ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law enforcement officials received a $646,668 check Friday from the U.S. 
Customs Commission -- a portion of the $718,000 seized in a 1987 drug and 
money-laundering raid in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"We're catching the crooks with the crooks' money and not the taxpayer's 
money," said Sheriff Brad Gates, who accepted the funds on behalf of the 
Regional Narcotics Suppression Program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, begun in 1987 to combat the narcotics trade in Orange County, 
brings together officers from 23 local, federal and state agencies, Garden 
Grove Police Capt. Tim Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gates, the program gets back 90% of the money seized in 
successfully prosecuted drug cases. Twenty-five percent of that goes toward the 
program's administrative costs and the rest is divided among participating law 
enforcement departments. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, Gates said, the program has seized $32 million in cash, 
90% of which is expected to be returned to it over the next 3 years as 
prosecutions go through the court system.

COMMISSION TO SEEK STATE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW TAX VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county's Legislative Planning Commission voted Friday to seek state 
legislation that would allow a countywide vote on a half-cent sales tax to pay 
for a new courthouse and the controversial Gypsum Canyon jail. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax, which could not be imposed without voter approval, is one of 
several financing mechanisms the county is considering to generate $700 million 
to build the facilities and $90 million a year to operate the jail. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said that although there has not 
been a decision on whether to have an election on the sales tax, the state 
legislation is required to "preserve an option." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a critical need that we've got to find a way to finance," Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative commission -- whose members are supervisors and county 
administrators -- also discussed a half-cent sales tax for road construction. 
The members also talked about whether the two half-cent measures should be 
combined on a 1-cent ballot measure or split, with one on the June and the 
other on the November, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Don R. Roth said they would give priority to 
the transportation tax if the measures had to be split. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in having both at the same time because you wouldn't want 
them both to lose," Roth said. Roth also cautioned that the county is still a 
long way from deciding whether to put a sales tax measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that people will think this is locked in concrete, and it's far 
from it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates told the commission members that he believes the public is 
ready to support a sales tax for jail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, said that "the sheriff makes a good case about all of the 
people he has to let go" because of overcrowding, "but the people who obey the 
law should have their needs considered too." With traffic congestion, "we're 
talking about the life style of a community that is at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, county officials suggested that a special countywide taxing district 
be created so that a surtax might be added to property tax bills to pay for the 
jail. That financing mechanism is called a Mello-Roos district, named for 
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) and state Sen. Henry J. Mello 
(D-Watsonville), authors of the enabling legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing such a district would require the approval of two-thirds of the 
voters, however; the sales tax would require that of only a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish noted that the sales tax would draw money from anyone making purchases 
in the county and that the taxing district would collect only from Orange 
County property owners. 
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no specific schedule for a decision on the financing 
package, as any election would be more than a year away. 
</P>
<P>
There is already a citizens initiative on the June, 1990, ballot to stop 
construction of the 6,000-bed Gypsum Canyon jail. The site is near Anaheim 
Hills.

'WARM LINE' LENDS BORED KIDS AN EAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kids in Irvine can call a special number when they are bored, lonely or even 
need help with their homework, and parents will be happy to know that the calls 
won't hike the phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid Phone-Warm Line, which celebrates its 1-year anniversary this month, 
received more than 6,200 calls last year about everything from imagined outer 
space experiences to new hamsters, coordinator Linda Zuba said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what children need more that anything else is to be listened to 
seriously," she said. Children need to know that their feelings and ideas are 
important, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the youngsters who dial (714) 756-WARM just want to talk. Others want 
information or to share their jokes and stories, Zuba said. "We have quite a 
few regular callers." 
</P>
<P>
One 8-year-old boy who called this week wanted to know how he could contact the 
Easter Bunny. "I guess he wanted to get a jump on the rest of the kids," Zuba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zuba and her volunteer staff, mostly student interns from UC Irvine and Orange 
Coast College, answer calls from 2 to 6 p.m. each weekday. Volunteers are 
rigorously screened and go through a 10-hour training program by three 
psychiatrists, she said. The emphasis of the training is listening, rather than 
giving advice, Zuba said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not advice-oriented at all," said the 30-year-old coordinator, whose 
soft voice gives the impression that she's not much older than her callers. She 
described what they do as more of an "airing out" process to help children 
think their problems through and come up with their own solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Kid Phone is called a "warm line," as opposed to a "hot line," Zuba said, 
because volunteers are trained primarily to handle non-emergency, 
"mellow-to-medium" calls. The rare callers with serious problems are referred 
to appropriate agencies for help or to their parents or school counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Most calls, Zuba said, are like that of a 9-year-old girl who was bored this 
week and asked what she should do. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Hilary Iha, 21, a UCI senior majoring in social ecology, told her, "I 
like to write letters." Seconds later, with a decision made, the caller was 
eager to get off the line to start her project -- a happy drawing she would 
send to her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Want to Talk 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Kliewer, a doctoral candidate in UC Irvine's social ecology program, said 
57% of the 3,300 calls she studied were from children bored or just wanting to 
talk, 18% wanted help with homework, and 10% wanted to discuss problems with 
peers. Less than 3% of the callers mentioned loneliness or sadness, problems 
with parents or siblings, or being scared or worried, as reasons for calling, 
she said. Most callers are 6 to 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Underhill, founder of a Yorba Linda-based Phone Friend, which suspended 
service this summer for repairs and is scheduled to reopen next month, said 
about 80% of the 1,500 calls a year since 1986 were from children who were just 
bored or lonely. 
</P>
<P>
"The most drastic emergencies we'd get would be the type where the toilet is 
running over," Underhill said. "Most kids just called to say, 'If you've got a 
minute, I'd just like to tell you what my day was like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since the Newport Beach Sunshine Line has been discontinued, Irvine Kid Phone 
and the Yorba Linda Phone Friend, which also serves Placentia, are the only 
free children's phone programs in Orange County that Underhill and Zuba know 
of. 
</P>
<P>
While there was no estimate available for the number of "latchkey children" in 
Orange County, Kliewer said 95% of the callers in her study were at home 
without adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
350 Programs 
</P>
<P>
Louise Guerney, a professor at Penn State University and training director of 
Phone Friend Inc. -- the first free children's phone support program in the 
United States -- estimated that 25% of U.S. children between the ages of 6 and 
12 are without adult supervision after school. She said that there are now at 
least 350 U.S. programs similar to Phone Friend. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed some services for latchkey kids in our community," Guerney 
said. Programs like Phone Friend can provide an alternative to child care 
because they are inexpensive and open to all children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't try to pretend that it would meet all the child-care needs," but it 
helps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marilee Cosgrove, who supervises Kid Phone through Irvine's Child Care Services 
department, said the programs also give officials information to make decisions 
concerning children. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids programs keep administrators in touch with kids," Cosgrove said. "You 
can't make decisions about children unless you know what concerns them, what 
they're thinking and feeling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clues for Officials 
</P>
<P>
The nature of calls, along callers' ages and schools, can give officials clues 
about everything from curriculum at schools to the concerns of children in 
certain age groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kid Phone operated with $14,000 in private donations for the final 6 months of 
the last fiscal year, Cosgrove said. She estimated that operating costs for 
this year would be between $25,000 and $30,000. Most funding will come from 
grants, fund-raising events and donations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Hadley, a member of the Irvine Unified School District board and one 
of the principal fund-raisers for Kid Phone's first year, described the service 
as "another piece of Irvine's child-care puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
"(Kid Phone) is like Mrs. Jones who was always home," Hadley said, describing 
the sort of block mother whom children once contacted in their parents' 
absence. "She didn't try to take over your family . . . she was just there as a 
resource."

RELUCTANT PENELOPE PLUCKED FROM BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As rescues go, it was not the most dramatic. And rookie Police Officer Roy 
Griffith had to drag Penelope, the springer spaniel, by her collar out of the 
burning home in Orange on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He had some help from a Southern California Edison Co. meter reader and a park 
ranger. Both reached the blaze in the 2100 block of Cleveland Street before the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
But that probably didn't matter much to Peggy and Donald George, whose beloved 
pet had survived the 11 a.m. fire that destroyed their entire roof, forcing 
them to find other lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze caused an estimated $140,000 damage, Battalion Chief Doug Flaherty 
said, and firefighter Dean Crockett suffered a burned wrist fighting the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
Only Penelope was home when an electrical short behind a clothes dryer 
apparently triggered the fire, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, it started growling at me," the 27-year-old officer said of the 
reluctant pooch. "But after I latched onto (her) collar and grabbed (her) 
outside, (she) was glad to see daylight. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, we didn't think of confronting the dog; we figured when 
we opened the front door the dog would just run out," Griffith said. "But she 
wasn't going out on her own."

TWICE THE SPACE FOR APPEALS DIVISION; 
</P>
<P>
COURT MOVES TO ROOMIER QUARTERS

<P>
Six law clerks shared one tiny office. Lawyers scrambled for even the smallest 
bit of clear working space in the standing-room-only library. And tracking down 
a book among the cramped shelves and storage areas was a task that would have 
frustrated anyone. 
</P>
<P>
That all ended Friday when the staff of the county division of the state 4th 
District Court of Appeal packed up law dictionaries, computers and case files 
and moved about a dozen blocks northeast in downtown Santa Ana to a sprawling, 
two-story new home. 
</P>
<P>
The new 60-room building, taking up more than 26,000 square feet in an early 
California-style structure on the corner of 10th and North Spurgeon streets, 
gives the court twice the space it had. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 5 years, since shortly after the opening of the Court of Appeal 
division, the court had functioned in what were seen as interim offices at the 
Sun West Bank building on Santa Ana Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outgrew Old Quarters 
</P>
<P>
But the appellate court, with its caseload growing substantially each year, 
quickly outgrew those quarters -- to the point that it was sometimes difficult 
to carry on business. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really sort of embarrassing to have (lawyers and clerks) working in 
such substandard conditions," Justice Edward J. Wallin said Friday afternoon as 
he began moving into his new chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Added librarian Clint Rees: The old quarters "made it pretty impossible to 
provide a real work environment for the attorneys who used the place." 
</P>
<P>
The new building is spacious. 
</P>
<P>
And the bright, airy rooms have fresh paint, new chandeliers, new lighting 
systems and plush new rugs, all the result of a $1.5-million internal 
renovation authorized by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
When the court first began looking for a permanent home a few years ago, the 
justices set their sights on the Old County Courthouse building. But when that 
fell through, they settled on the newly constructed Spurgeon Street building. 
</P>
<P>
The court has a 10-year lease on the structure, owned by Santa Ana resident 
Larry Moore. And the justices seem so pleased with their new surroundings that 
they said Friday they are virtually certain to exercise another 10-year option 
a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
"This really gives us the space we need to grow years down the road," said 
Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr., "and it looks like it's going to work out great 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
Still remaining is the question of staffing to fill the building. With a 
backlog of almost 500 pending cases, the court could now use at least three 
more justices in addition to the present five, Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
But the air of fiscal constraint in Sacramento and Orange County's relatively 
unsuccessful record of getting funding for additional court personnel make that 
prospect anything but a sure bet, Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the sense of promise offered by the spacious building, Friday's move 
was not without its glitches. 
</P>
<P>
The power lines for the computer system were installed at too low a voltage and 
had to be rewired. A number of phones never arrived. And a few messengers were 
not sure whether to deliver filings for the court to the old building or the 
new one. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, as several justices pointed out, it was Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Weekend 
</P>
<P>
The court should be more or less open for business on Tuesday. The court's 
staff plans to work this weekend to unpack and set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Sheila P. Soneshine has already gotten a jump on her colleagues by 
putting her own distinctive stamp on her chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the traditional soft blue rug and brown wooden decor, Soneshine 
opted for what is, by court standards, a radical pink-and-black motif, complete 
with a leather sofa and black speckled rug. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone entering her bright pink bathroom is warned by a sign: "Due to the force 
generated by the walls of this room, we ask that expectant mothers and those 
with weak hearts please not use this facility." 
</P>
<P>
And what do her fellow justices think of Soneshine's interior design work? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment," smirked Crosby.

DEATH-CAMP CONVENT ISSUE POSTPONES INTERFAITH TALKS

An international dialogue between Jews and Vatican officials has been postponed 
because of a continuing controversy over a Carmelite convent on the site of the 
Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Ten nuns had been living at the convent since 1984, but the site became the 
focus of an international controversy in January, 1986, when a letter from a 
group raising funds for the convent promoted it as "a spiritual fortress and a 
guarantee of the conversion of strayed brothers from our countries, as well as 
proof of our desire to erase outrages so often done to the Vicar of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders protested the location of a convent on the site of the 
concentration camp, which they wanted preserved as a memorial to the Nazi 
persecution of Jews. In February, 1987, Vatican officials and four European 
cardinals signed an agreement in Geneva stipulating that "there will be no 
permanent Catholic place of prayer on the site of the Auschwitz and Birkenau 
camps." The Catholic officials agreed that the convent would be relocated about 
a mile away from Auschwitz by Feb. 22, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But last November, Vatican officials indicated that the nuns were resisting the 
move. Representatives of the World Jewish Congress said they would not take 
part in a Catholic-Jewish dialogue scheduled to be held in Zurich Feb. 20-24 
unless the convent was moved.

CHURCH LEADERS ANNOUNCE ANTI-APARTHEID CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<P>
The leaders of seven denominations have announced a joint campaign to mobilize 
their national memberships in support a variety of anti-apartheid measures, 
including comprehensive U.S. sanctions against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative was devised at a summit of leaders of black church groups here 
Tuesday and Wednesday. The denominations represented at the meeting -- the 
African Methodist Episcopal Church, AME Zion Church, Christian Methodist 
Episcopal Church, Church of God in Christ, National Baptist Convention of 
America, National Baptist Convention U.S.A. and the Progressive National 
Baptist Convention -- have a combined membership of 19 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensifying brutality of the Pretoria regime -- death and detention of 
children, attacks against the churches and church leaders -- and the war 
against South Africa's neighbors compel us to speak out as one united voice for 
an end to the pain being inflicted upon our sisters and brothers," the leaders 
said in a closing statement. 
</P>
<P>
The effort announced here originated in a September, 1987, challenge by the 
Rev. Alan Boesak, a leading South African anti-apartheid activist. In a speech 
to black church leaders in Atlanta, Boesak, a minister in the Dutch Reformed 
Church and president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, called on them 
to "exert every effort possible to bring an end to the long night of suffering 
by the people of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overseas Visit 
</P>
<P>
In September, a delegation of church leaders traveled to southern Africa to 
meet with South African church leaders and officials of other anti-apartheid 
groups, including the African National Congress. The discussions were carried 
on in neighboring countries because delegation members had been denied visas to 
enter South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders vowed at the meeting to engage their memberships in actions that 
would support: 
</P>
<P>
* Stronger U.S. economic sanctions against South Africa. In particular, they 
pledged support for a bill by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-California) that would impose further sanctions on South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. economic aid for the black-ruled states that border South Africa. The 
church leaders said South Africa has punished these nations economically and 
militarily for their opposition to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
* An end to U.S. backing for the South Africa-supported rebels trying to 
overthrow the government of Angola, which has had the aid of Cuban troops. The 
group also said it would seek a meeting with President-elect George Bush, who 
has assured Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of continued U.S. support. 
</P>
<P>
* The international boycott of Shell Oil Co., which has clashed with 
anti-apartheid activists and churches over its activities in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak said at the meeting that U.S. sanctions against South Africa have been 
effective and that they played a role in South Africa's recent decision to 
settle conflicts in Namibia and Angola. As part of the U.S.-brokered 
settlement, South Africa agreed to withdraw its forces from Namibia and to end 
its aid to Savimbi's anticommunist rebels; Angola agreed to an evacuation of 
Cuban troops. Boesak also said the sanctions have helped cool South Africa's 
economy, which has made it harder for the country to maintain its military 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986. Last year, 
the House of Representatives approved a bill imposing further sanctions, but no 
such measure was considered in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Consensus on ANC 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Ruben Speaks of the AME Zion Church said the church leaders reached no 
consensus on whether to back the African National Congress. The ANC, which has 
been banned in South Africa, has been accused of terrorism in its struggle 
against the South African government. 
</P>
<P>
There were statements indicating sympathy with the ANC, however. "We do not 
agree with others who have called them terrorists and communists," said the 
Rev. Mac Charles Jones of the National Baptist Convention of America.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: STARR'S ACT HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Starr returned home from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention 
this week with a swollen right hand and approval for the first Disneyland 
Pigskin Classic. The hand will heal; it's the Pigskin Classic that Starr hopes 
will swell. 
</P>
<P>
Starr slapped more backs, shook more hands, endured more boring stories, pasted 
more silly grins on his face than an RV salesman with a quota to fill. Had 
someone asked Starr to sing show tunes, he would have asked, "What key?" and 
then belted out the theme to "Brigadoon." No dummy, is Starr. He arrived at the 
convention with his own hoop to jump through. If NCAA members, specifically, 
the assembled college presidents and athletic directors, wanted a floor act, 
Starr would give it to them. Just as long as he got votes in return. 
</P>
<P>
So there was Starr, tap dancing his way into the hearts of the unconvinced. He 
wanted a season-opening football game for Anaheim Stadium, sort of a Kickoff 
Classic-West. NCAA types wanted reasons why they should vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
After all, does college football need another bowl game, preseason or 
otherwise? Isn't there something wrong with a football game that begins before 
the leaves change? And how exactly can you call it the Pigskin Classic when the 
first game has yet to be played? 
</P>
<P>
As for timing, Starr's couldn't have been worse. This was an ugly, unruly bunch 
of conventioneers. Or as Starr put it: "There was not a lot of humor at the 
convention this year." 
</P>
<P>
The furor over Proposition 48 had divided them, caused their tempers to soar 
and their patience to wane. Nays came easier than yeas. About the last thing 
you wanted to do was trot out Mickey Mouse and start jabbering about Pigskin 
Classics and what not. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what Starr did. He threw Mickey and the gang at them and hoped 
nobody threw the lovable rodent back. He mentioned that the prime beneficiary 
of the game would be a trust fund for the American Football Coaches Assn. (The 
way things are going in college athletics these days, I would have suggested it 
go to a legal fund, but that's just me.) 
</P>
<P>
Starr had all sorts of fancy-schmancy reasons why football needed the Pigskin 
Classic, beginning with the apple-pie Disney image and ending with my personal 
favorite: You don't have to go to East Rutherford, N.J., to see a preseason 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney people did what they could. They distributed to voters a 7-minute 
videotape that featured the many advantages of the Classic (argh). They dangled 
the Disney name. They revealed that Sneezy suffers from a rare allergenic 
condition, thus, his name. 
</P>
<P>
If someone wanted to hear the pitch, Starr &amp; Co. unveiled their pie charts 
and market shares and began selling. The American Football Coaches Board of 
Directors listened. So did the National Assn. of College Directors of Athletics 
-- three times. So did the various television networks. And so did the 
conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"We did our homework," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with all the high-level schmoozing, Starr still wasn't sure he had 
enough votes for passage. A roll call: 
</P>
<P>
The coaches loved the idea. Of course, who could blame them? Money would go to 
their trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic directors generally were in favor of the game. Then again, any 
deal that might eventually mean more bucks for their program usually ensures 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Now the college presidents . . . that's a whole other breed of animal. They're 
a conservative group by nature. Just because somebody sticks a free Mickey 
Mouse beanie on their head doesn't mean they'll vote yes. You need to reason 
with them, appeal to their intellectual senses. 
</P>
<P>
Or beg, whatever works best. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very concerned about academics," Starr said. "They're just afraid of 
adding a lot of new events." 
</P>
<P>
So Starr told them not to worry. That academics wouldn't be compromised because 
classes don't start in August, which is when the Pigskin Classic is scheduled 
to be played. And new events? There's only one other preseason game. Compare 
that to the 17 postseason games presently sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
And then Starr held his breath, and with good reason. The coaches may clamor 
for the game, the athletic directors may heartily endorse it, but without the 
college presidents' approval -- and vote -- all you've got is a mouse holding a 
football with mud on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know until going into the convention hall whether we had the votes or 
not," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Now he knows: 61 Division I-A schools voted yes, 47 voted no. Starting in 1990, 
Anaheim Stadium has another bowl game on its hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we pulled off a major coup," Starr said. "We were one of the few 
proposals that got passed." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as Starr plans, the Pigskin Classic will strengthen the struggling 
Freedom Bowl. Something about a package deal involving ticket sales and 
television rights. 
</P>
<P>
We'll see. For now, Starr should enjoy his victory. And maybe soak that right 
hand, too.

Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center this month will begin construction of 
an outpatient surgical center next to the hospital in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million project, called the Mission Ambulatory SurgiCenter, is a joint 
venture between the hospital and members of the hospital's medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
The center will have five operating rooms and is expected to be open in 
November. "It is going to give more options to patients and physicians and 
ultimately lower costs for less complicated procedures by offering an 
alternative to hospital surgery," said Beth Groves, the hospital's community 
relations coordinator.

A New York investor has acquired 31% of Plaza Communications Inc., an Irvine 
financial publishing concern. Theodore L. Cross, a New York publisher of legal 
textbooks, increased his stake in Plaza from 26% to 31% during the fourth 
quarter ended Oct. 31, 1988, according to documents filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. Tolman Geffs, Plaza Communications chief executive and 
founder, controls 51% of the company's stock. Plaza Communications publishes 
Personal Investor, a monthly magazine with 119,000 subscribers, and Registered 
Representative, a trade magazine distributed to stock brokers. Last year the 
company earned $151,000 on sales of $1.5 million.

LITTLE BANK THAT CAN; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY PACIFIC'S STATE-CHARTED OFFSPRING PROVIDES PARENT WITH NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bankers were a little surprised when Security Pacific Corp. formed a 
state-chartered bank 4 1/2 years ago to take over most of the $29 million in 
assets at the failed Bank of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the company already owned Security Pacific National Bank, the 
state's second largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
But Security Pacific State Bank, as the young institution is known, has given 
the company access to a wide variety of business opportunities that are closed 
to its national bank and even to itself as a national bank holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Now the state bank, one of the most profitable and most overcapitalized banks 
in Orange County, is poised to plumb the riches of Proposition 103 by offering 
the national bank's 3 million customers a complete line of insurance products 
-- from automobile policies to casualty coverage. 
</P>
<P>
For under Prop. 103 -- the November initiative better known for its provision 
to roll back insurance rates 20% -- it is only state-chartered banks, not 
national banks, that can sell a full line of insurance policies. Security 
Pacific State and First Interstate Bank, the only state-chartered institution 
among the major banks, are awaiting license approval from the state Insurance 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific State expects approval within a week or so and plans to start 
marketing some insurance policies within the next 2 months, said James N. 
Koury, a corporate executive and chairman of the state bank. 
</P>
<P>
But insurance is only part of the formula that has made the company's step into 
state-chartered waters successful. 
</P>
<P>
"This has turned out to be an exceptional investment, a really great one," 
Koury said. 
</P>
<P>
The state charter gives the company the ability not only to take advantage of 
wider investment powers and business opportunities provided under state law, he 
said, but also to offer customized products to its targeted market -- other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific State ended the year with net income of $4.7 million, 52% 
higher than the previous year's earnings of $3.1 million. Fueled by huge 
reserves of capital, its size more than doubled to $225.1 million at the end of 
December from $106.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures may appear paltry compared to the parent's consolidated assets of 
$78.9 billion and earnings of $469.4 million for the first 9 months alone, but 
the small state bank's results are well above almost all of Orange County's 
community banks. 
</P>
<P>
After it started operations in May, 1984, Security Pacific State began stashing 
away capital as it engaged in one of the more controversial powers permitted 
state-chartered banks -- direct investments in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
At one point 2 years ago, Security Pacific State's capital amounted to 46% of 
its assets, even though regulators required only a 6% ratio. The bank had built 
up about $15 million in real estate investments and commitments through joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to participate in the joint ventures was the reason the parent 
company kept the state-chartered bank, Koury and Security Pacific State 
President Duane Rickard acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
But when the parent sought regulatory approval in September, 1986, for its 
purchase of Arizona Bancwest Corp. in Phoenix, it cut a deal with regulators. 
To acquire Arizona's third-largest banking company, Security Pacific Corp. 
agreed to end the state bank's joint venture deals. 
</P>
<P>
"With the joint ventures gone, the company had to rethink why it wanted a state 
charter," Rickard said. 
</P>
<P>
After an examination of the other powers offered banks under state law, the 
parent decided the state charter still had "strategic value" that wasn't 
available elsewhere, Koury said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, with its huge capital base, the bank could grow substantially. While 
the bank's assets doubled in the past year, for instance, its capital grew by 
only $7 million to $56.1 million. Still, its ratio of capital to assets at year 
end was 24%. And it plans to have $500 million in assets within 3 years, Koury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As it wound down its joint venture operations, the state bank increased its 
efforts to market its products -- consumer loans, student loans and automated 
teller machine services, for example -- to other financial institutions. It 
allowed the institutions to offer those loans or other products under their own 
names. 
</P>
<P>
The bank now has 15 loans, services and other products it offers to such 
financial institutions as banks and savings and loans. And it offers those 
products directly to its small coterie of retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific State also began creating subsidiaries that its giant sister 
couldn't have. Those subsidiaries engage in such services as management 
consulting, auditing, computer consulting and real estate consulting for 
automobile sales centers. 
</P>
<P>
The state bank now has seven subsidiaries, including the recently purchased 
Summit Inc., a Corvallis, Ore., company that handles data processing for credit 
unions. Six of its units, including Summit, are subsidiaries that the national 
bank is not permitted to own. 
</P>
<P>
One subsidiary, for example, buys assets -- usually packages of loans -- from 
banks and S&amp;Ls that need cash and sells those assets to other financial 
institutions looking for investments. 
</P>
<P>
"The state bank simply has more flexibility than the national bank. . . ," 
Koury said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the parent company's and the national bank's subsidiaries are dedicated 
to supporting the national bank's customer base, he said. That left the state 
bank with room to do different things, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The newest activity is insurance. It will be handled by the state bank itself 
partly because the Federal Reserve Board is proposing to limit the activities 
of state bank subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The state bank expects to sell insurance policies to customers of the national 
bank, which in turn will let customers put the premiums on their credit cards 
so they can pay monthly, said Richard M. Horn, vice president and general 
counsel of Security Pacific Insurance Group. 
</P>
<P>
Horn's group, a company subsidiary that is helping the state bank's insurance 
effort get off the ground, is limited by law to selling insurance only on such 
bank services as credit card balances and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
That the state bank was ready to file for its insurance license the day after 
Prop. 103 passed doesn't surprise analysts familiar with the corporation. It 
has a reputation for experimenting. 
</P>
<P>
"Security Pacific tries anything," said Dan Williams, an industry analyst at 
Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. "They look at everything. There isn't 
anything in banking that they don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the parent has had to halt its experiments. It killed its export 
trading company after it turned out be duplicating efforts elsewhere, and it 
recently scaled back its business in Europe when competition proved too great, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Security Pacific State Bank may be a little jewel that the analysts haven't 
found yet. Williams and other analysts said they know little about the state 
bank's operations, though they figure the insurance effort will be used to help 
the national bank broaden its services and sell customers other bank products. 
</P>
<P>
But Koury and Rickard believe the industry will be hearing more about Security 
Pacific State. Starting with its Jan. 24 annual meeting, Koury said, the bank 
plans to promote itself more actively than it has in the past.

ON THE WATERFRONT: INFLATABLES ARE COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life.

<P>
Every year, Scott McIntosh cruises to Catalina, fishes in Mexico, skims down 
the Colorado River, water skis on Lake Mojave and goes whale-watching off Dana 
Point -- all with a portable, inflatable boat that folds up to the size of an 
overstuffed laundry bag. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh is out to prove a point: You don't have to be rich to own a seaworthy 
boat that can take you just about anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 15 years, McIntosh, owner of a Costa Mesa company that sells 
inflatables, has been putting together adventurous trips for an informal club 
made up of inflatable boat owners. The trips sound like something you would do 
in a big boat rather than a miniature vessel made of rubberized fabric and 
filled with air. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the most popular excursion is a summer cruise to Catalina Island, 
a journey more commonly made in boats much more substantial than an inflatable 
dinghy. The Catalina cruise, which dates back to 1975, drew 25 boats last 
summer and McIntosh expects even more this year. (While inflatables range in 
size from 8 to 24 feet, the minimum allowed for the Catalina trip is 13 feet.) 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to show the versatility of these boats," McIntosh says. "In the 
nearly 15 years, we've been doing these Catalina crossings, we have never had 
an instant of danger. And we've come back across in 7-foot seas. The boats are 
very stable, very safe." 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh, who bought the 21-year-old Port-A-Marine boat business from his 
father-in-law in 1980, holds four group cruises each year for owners of 
inflatable boats. This year's activities begin Sunday with a whale-watching 
cruise off Dana Point. About 20 boats are expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, club members gathered to hear a representative from the American 
Cetacean Society talk about the migrating whales and offer tips on how to 
observe the great sea creatures without disturbing them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pre-trip meeting so that we have people responsible out there 
watching whales," McIntosh said. "During the 7 years we have been doing these 
trips, we have failed to spot whales only twice. Seeing a whale from a small 
boat like that is a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Also planned this year are trips to Lake Mojave and to the Sea of Cortez. 
Members drive to a prearranged location, inflate and launch their boats for a 
day of fishing or sightseeing, McIntosh says. (All events are open to any owner 
of an inflatable boat; however, advance registration is required.) 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do a Colorado River rapids trip," McIntosh says, "but we don't do 
that any more because of potential liability." However, McIntosh and his wife, 
Diana, plan to make a trip to the rapids on their own this year. 
</P>
<P>
The group trips began as a way to keep inflatable boat owners in touch with 
each other and to demonstrate that you can do a lot of "bit boat" cruising in 
an affordable, portable boat, McIntosh says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go camping at the river; you can go out in the ocean; you can fish, 
and you can even water ski with them. And everything is fully portable. They 
don't require a large engine, and you can run all day on 6 gallons of fuel. You 
don't pay any slip or storage fees and they are compact and stowable. You can 
put one in your closet." 
</P>
<P>
A typical 12- to 14-foot boat deflates to a 130-pound "laundry bag" package. 
The outboard motor generally weighs another 100 pounds. Such a boat costs 
between $3,000 and $4,000, including motor. Used boats, however, can cost less 
than half that. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of inflatable boats continues to grow as the modern life style 
changes, according to McIntosh. "For example, in Italy and France, 85% of all 
registered boats are inflatables. That's because Europeans live in apartments 
and don't have a lot of storage room." 
</P>
<P>
As more Americans begin to live in smaller spaces, McIntosh predicts, 
inflatables will become just as popular here. Already, he says, he is seeing a 
change in the type of customer such boats attract. 
</P>
<P>
Inflatable boats, he explains, don't just appeal to boaters. Most customers are 
outdoor enthusiasts who are looking for "a water-oriented piece of recreational 
equipment rather than just a boat," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But McIntosh is quick to point out that an inflatable boat is not a toy. "One 
of the big inflatable boat manufacturers surveyed its customers and found that 
the main reason they bought inflatables was because of safety," McIntosh said. 
"Inflatable boats are very stable; they don't tip over. And even partially 
deflated, they don't sink." 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh has seen proof of the sturdiness of one such boat. "During one of our 
whale-watching cruises one of the boats hit a plank with some nails and was 
ripped," he recalls. "Two-thirds of the boat deflated. The boat had four people 
in it and we have a picture of them standing up in the boat. They were all OK 
and the boat was still afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Boating Classes -- A variety of sailing classes will be offered by UC Irvine 
beginning Tuesday at the Intercollegiate Sailing Base, 1801 W. Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning, intermediate and advanced sailing will be taught during 10 different 
classes. Fees range from $32 to $43, depending upon the class. Further 
information is available by calling the UCI recreation office at (714) 
856-5346. 
</P>
<P>
Parade Prizes -- Top prizes in the 80th annual Newport Harbor Christmas Parade 
of Lights will be awarded during a dinner Friday at the Newport Beach Marriott, 
900 Newport Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sweepstakes winner was frequent past winner Bobby Cornelius for his elaborately 
decorated 65-foot powerboat the Merry Maker. 
</P>
<P>
On Board the Californian -- A day cruise aboard the tall ship Californian in 
celebration of Orange County's centennial will be offered by the Nautical 
Heritage Society beginning on weekends in March. 
</P>
<P>
The excursions are open to the public and will depart at 10 a.m. from Dana 
Point Harbor, returning at 4 p.m. The ticket price of $65 includes lunch. Call 
(714) 661-1001 for information and reservations.

THE CRYSTAL SET; 
</P>
<P>
FOLLOWERS OF THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT FIND ROOM TO GROW IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On the day in June that Sherry Scott of Mission Viejo got her breast cancer 
diagnosis, she telephoned Kate, her friend in Texas. "Her very first response 
was that there was a person she wanted me to see," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
The person was Jan Fisher, a former intensive-care unit nurse who operates a 
private "healing practice" in Laguna Niguel, in which she uses crystal healing, 
channeling and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Although large segments of the public sneer at such things as the alleged 
healing power of crystals, Scott has become convinced that Fisher has done 
wonders for her mind and body. "Nobody can tell me it's woo-woo because it's 
not," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Scott, 52 and a self-described "old Iowa conservative," has joined 
the ranks of the so-called New Age, a movement rooted in Eastern theology but 
cross-fertilized by philosophy, psychology and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever had intuition where you know something to be true?" Scott said. 
"This was the feeling I had. I had talked to my friend about Jan, but I never 
had a personal need to go talk to her. 
</P>
<P>
"So I took a week to think about it. The more I thought about it, the more I 
thought (her cancer) is happening for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I'm an intelligent person. I'm going to go and talk to her and see 
what's going on.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the not-too-distant past, New Age was most often associated with the occult, 
conjuring up notions of swamis, Gypsies and crystal balls. Now -- with actress 
Shirley MacLaine publishing books about past lives and inspiring a network TV 
miniseries, with Nancy Reagan revealing her interest in astrology, with 
National Public Radio broadcasting a Christmas story about a wizard searching 
for a magic crystal and with the music industry offering Grammys for New Age 
music -- the movement's credibility appears to be rising. 
</P>
<P>
Because the movement has no formal organization or household names as its 
leaders, charting its public popularity is difficult. But while Los Angeles 
dominates the New Age scene in Southern California, Orange County people can 
also find an ample menu of New Age items to sample. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they can go to any of a dozen or more bookstores from Yorba Linda 
to Costa Mesa, to a church in Irvine, to a channeling class in Newport Beach or 
to a past-life workshop in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Resources, a trimonthly Huntington Beach publication that has 
tripled its number of pages in 5 years, lists dozens of New Age events or 
seminars. The 160-page Southern California New Age telephone book lists nearly 
240 categories of products or services. The National New Age Yellow Pages is 
published in Fullerton and identifies itself as "the complete directory of 
consciousness-raising services, products and organizations." 
</P>
<P>
But not all the New Age vibrations in the county are good. 
</P>
<P>
Linda McNamar is the assistant minister at the Church of Religious Science in 
Huntington Beach, which claims a 3,000-member congregation. "I was comfortable 
calling myself a New Age person years ago, and I'm not comfortable calling 
myself a New Age person now because of the misunderstanding that might occur in 
some people's thinking about what I believe and how I live my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the church does not believe in putting power in outside forces, 
such as crystals or channels, in which people act as conduits for others to 
unseen spiritual contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Like McNamar, others have edged away from linking themselves completely to New 
Age thought. The Helix Center in El Toro is often mentioned by New Agers as one 
of the focal points of New Age activity in the county. In the last year, 
however, new executive director Leonard Cohn has shied away from overtly 
trumpeting the bookstore as a New Age center, although it identifies some of 
its materials as New Age. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he identified the center as a "creative education center and 
bookstore" because, he said, under the previous management the center "was 
never a financial success. They always ran a deficit." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the lectures, seminars and other programs offered to the 
public suffered from waning attendance. 
</P>
<P>
None of the more established New Age merchants described Orange County as a 
hotbed of activity, but many believe that the public's willingness to consider 
New Age practices is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Ingenito is editor and publisher of the National New Age Yellow Pages, a 
250-page combination of telephone directory and New Age resource book. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County tends to be very conservative, and New Age was underground for a 
very, very long time," she said. "What makes it quite a wonderful place to be 
if you're interested in New Age is that people are coming out of the woodwork 
because they're no longer afraid of being criticized, they recognize their own 
strength and they believe in what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ingenito said that most of the New Age merchants now advertising have been 
around for 10 years or more but that stereotypes of the movement -- that it is 
satanic or cultish -- kept retailers from seeking mainstream recognition. 
</P>
<P>
In its most encompassing terms, the New Age movement is a continuation of the 
"consciousness-raising" that surfaced in the 1960s. It is as old as Eastern 
religions and as new as the pop-psyche trends of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Devotees tend to believe that there are vast untapped resources of energy and 
awareness within the human mind that, if pursued, can lead to personal 
betterment. It butts heads with Western religion, because most New Agers 
believe that traditional Judeo-Christian theology is but one source of a 
person's search for truth. 
</P>
<P>
But not all New Age exponents subscribe to all the movement's practices, with 
many of the most committed believers warning about false prophets in the New 
Age camp. 
</P>
<P>
It is a largely laissez faire movement, probably because it is so diverse and 
personalized in its approach. It doesn't have the fervor of organized 
religions, because there is no credo. Indeed, it incorporates ideas as mundane 
as meditation and vegetarianism to things as other-worldly as belief in 
past-life experiences and reincarnation, channeling (getting in touch with 
mystic spirit guides) and personal energy fields. 
</P>
<P>
Many aspects seem little more than harmless oddities and have entered the 
mainstream consciousness, as evidenced by the selling of crystals at major 
department stores or greeting card shops. 
</P>
<P>
But with so many seemingly harmless oddities to it, the New Age movement has 
stirred some fervent opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burrows is editor of the Spiritual Counterfeits Project newsletter, 
published by a Berkeley-based organization that opposes the New Age movement 
because of its conflicts with traditional Judeo-Christian religion. He said New 
Age "used to be assigned to the fringe part of society, but the interesting 
development now with New Age is that it no longer is on the fringe; it's really 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the seemingly harmless aspects that might accompany New Age thought, it 
is basically a spiritual movement, Burrows said: "It speaks to the profound 
alienation that people experience in this culture, but it does nothing to 
relieve it. It actually exaggerates it and gives it religious justification." 
</P>
<P>
As such, New Age may not seem as threatening to mainstream America as have 
other spiritual-based movements. Indeed, New Age music, unlike the head-banging 
that traditionalists have come to associate with the "latest sound," is in fact 
a dreamy, instrumental style that some find soothing and others find 
narcoleptic. 
</P>
<P>
New Agers, Burrows said, believe that "humanity shares divineness with a 
deified creation. Humanity has all the wisdom and power of the deity. The basic 
appeal is power. That's a particularly reassuring message in a society where 
people feel profoundly impotent." 
</P>
<P>
Writing in "Equipping the Saints," an evangelical Christian magazine published 
in Anaheim, author Douglas Groothuis describes the New Age movement as a 
"smorgasbord of spiritual substitutes for Christianity, all heralding our 
unlimited potential to transform ourselves and the planet so that a 'New Age' 
of peace, light and love will break forth." 
</P>
<P>
Groothuis encouraged practicing Christians to "pray for New Agers and against 
the New Age movement." 
</P>
<P>
New Agers tend to be more passive toward Christians. That's because they view 
Christ's teachings as but one source of information, but not one to debase. But 
most concurred with the view that New Age offers a refuge for those unsatisfied 
with traditional religions. 
</P>
<P>
Caren Croxen has a marriage and family counseling practice in Fountain Valley 
and is a New Age exponent. She will apply her New Age beliefs if people ask her 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've gone well beyond a particular sector, like hippies, being 
interested in it," she said. "I notice in my everyday counseling, I work with 
some very straight people. They'll talk about the power of the mind to keep us 
well or happy. They'll talk about having lived before and reincarnation and 
that they expect to live again. These are topics people never brought up before 
in regular sessions." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Easley, activities coordinator of the Psynetics Foundation in Anaheim -- 
which offers a wide range of New Age activities and programs -- said New Age 
thinking is less stigmatic today because more and more people have experienced 
such things as psychic phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation opened in 1962 as a lecture group. "New Age thinking is more 
accepted now because it's come out of the back rooms," Easley said. "Only those 
who are very narrow-minded would call it the work of the devil." 
</P>
<P>
Other New Agers are more dubious about how widespread the movement has become. 
Brian Enright, who publishes Orange County Resources from his Huntington Beach 
apartment, said he thinks the people who were attracted to the 
consciousness-raising movements of the 1960s are "the workhorses of the New 
Age." 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when Shirley MacLaine came out, a lot of people jumped on the 
bandwagon," he said. "Crystals and channeling, it was really fascinating. There 
are still people on that level, fascinated by the more dramatic aspects rather 
than seeing any vehicle for personal and planetary transformation. I started to 
wince a little about the term New Age because it came to mean so many fringy 
things. So there is a media New Age, and there are people deeply and genuinely 
committed to planetary transformation." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pizazz of things such as channeling, Enright said his publication's 
most successful issue was devoted to vegetarianism. He began his magazine in 
1984, and it has peaked at 40,000 copies, distributed free at various outlets. 
</P>
<P>
New Age thinking "is more mainstream but not to a large degree," Enright said. 
"You can get away with wearing crystals, but if you tell someone at work you're 
going to a channeling, they look at you strangely. If you tell someone you're 
going to an Indian sweat lodge, they might say, 'Hey, isn't that great,' but 
when you leave, they're going to say, 'That's weird.' " 
</P>
<P>
That does not make the movement's intrusion into the public's consciousness any 
less troubling to its opponents. Kevin Springer, editor of the evangelical 
Christian magazine Equipping the Saints, said he was eating lunch one day when 
a woman sat down next to him and began talking about the Harmonic Convergence 
in August, 1987, which many considered a seminal moment in the New Age. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized then it was fairly pervasive," Springer said. "The problem is that, 
to the people who are in this, it isn't a joke to them. It's very serious. It's 
life and death. I have to admit that I used to just laugh it off, slough it 
off, but when we put this issue of the magazine together (the fall, 1988, issue 
devoted to the New Age movement), we realized this is a comprehensive world 
view they have, and it needs to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a society that is so influenced by materialism and rationalism and 
individualism, that people are looking for something new. They've rejected 
traditional Christianity, but now they have the feeling that there has to be 
more than just one thing. They're not just satisfied with what's left. This 
irrational kind of involvement, whether it's channeling or reincarnation, gives 
a release to people, and they're really jumping into it." 
</P>
<P>
Springer said while "some Christians are hysterical" about New Age, he thinks 
that is overreaction: "I don't perceive it as being a threat to Christianity. I 
perceive it as being wrongheaded and a dangerous way of thinking about life and 
one's self." 
</P>
<P>
Even among supporters of the broader New Age philosophies, rifts have 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
Cohn, a retired home builder who took over the Helix Center, said he has "some 
philosophical differences with New Age." They center on his belief that the 
answers to people's anxieties are found within, rather than from such outside 
sources as a channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Orange County, with our conservative population, New Age is of 
interest to a small percentage of the population," Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
New Age, he said, represents another avenue "for people to find comfort in 
their lives and (for people) who have been turned off by the traditional 
religions and, to a little extent, by the totally scientific, pragmatic 
viewpoint and are looking to embrace or explore alternatives in terms of 
spirituality and healing." 
</P>
<P>
New Age appeals to them, he said, "because it promises a connection to a higher 
self." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many people became disillusioned with the movement because it 
promised things it could not deliver. 
</P>
<P>
Even the strongest New Age devotees caution novices to be wary of those 
offering New Age programs. "There can be some people who are sincere and others 
who are fools," according to Easley of the Psynetics Foundation. "They think 
they're tapping into other dimensions. Some are and some aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical talk does little to deter die-hard New Agers, who believe that the 
move toward an enlightened state is a slow evolutionary process. 
</P>
<P>
Their confidence is such that Rochelle Muro has opened a New Age bookstore in 
Yorba Linda -- one of the county's most conservative areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed one here," Muro said. "Someone had to do it. I know (a large New Age 
clientele) is not here in north Orange County. It will grow in 2 or 3 years. It 
will take a year for the shock of moving in to wear off." 
</P>
<P>
But asked about the commercial perils of her venture, she said there is more to 
her effort than that: "My purpose is to teach, to educate." 
</P>
<P>
As for Scott of Mission Viejo, she has had no recurrence of cancer in the few 
months since her mastectomy and is continuing to look at her condition from a 
New Age point of view.

JOSEPH N. BELL: IN WINTER, THE BEACH BELONGS TO US AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a sparkling, crackling clear day between the rains. I top the rise on 
Marguerite Street and the Pacific is suddenly spread out before me -- the 
closest I'll ever come in this life to infinity. 
</P>
<P>
This is a Thursday, 2 hours past noon, midwinter. A few months from now, 
parking will be hard to find on the street above the beach in Corona del Mar, 
there will be a profusion of out-of-state license plates, and the sand will be 
crawling with people in sunglasses dragging deck chairs and small children. But 
today, the beach belongs to the natives. It's ours in the winter -- at least 
those of us who can look up from work long enough to discover we can have this 
magnificence almost all to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
On the grassy rim above the beach, the regulars have set up shop. An elderly 
couple in His and Her lawn chairs, reading books and communicating through 
their silence. Joggers, breathing hard, who have stopped to rest and immerse 
themselves in the view. Other portable chairs are scattered along the grass, 
mostly inhabited by older people reading but with folks just sitting and 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
There is much to see. The winter rains have momentarily washed away the smog 
with which we shroud ourselves, and it's startling to realize what it could be 
like if we stopped fouling our own atmosphere. Santa Catalina Island in its 
full length stands out in sharp bas-relief, breathtaking in its size and 
proximity, like a lost continent that appears once or twice a year to entice 
us. From above, the beach looks almost entirely deserted, a vast expanse of 
sand broken only by multiple refuse containers, fire pits, and two small boys 
kicking a soccer ball while their mother idles along behind. 
</P>
<P>
I drive down to the parking lot -- no fee on winter weekdays -- and find the 
look from above is deceptive. The beach just looks deserted; actually, there is 
much life here. It just has to be seen up close. As I park, several hundred 
nervous gulls on the sand in front of me scramble, like a crazed air squadron 
on instant alert. They settle down again 100 yards away, awaiting the next sign 
of danger. A pickup truck pulls up beside me in the almost deserted parking 
lot, and two men in work clothes get out. They have a bag from a fast-food 
restaurant, and they head across the sand, leaving a large, shaggy dog in the 
cab watching them forlornly. 
</P>
<P>
I walk down to the seawall that parallels the boat channel to the open sea. The 
sun is deceptive; it proffers warmth but the wind takes it away, gusting and 
swirling with a real cutting edge. The water in the channel is turbulent, 
slapping angrily at the seawall. For the first time in my memory, there are no 
boats in the channel. 
</P>
<P>
But people walk here, some of them bracing against the wind, some oblivious to 
it. A white-haired man in a Windbreaker emerges from the rocks with his small 
grandson who struggles along behind; they are in earnest and animated 
conversation. Two sets of lovers come into view, one young and in blue jeans, 
the other middle-aged and in street clothes. The older couple sits on a ledge 
behind the seawall, talking quietly, ignoring the wind. The younger couple 
climbs out on the jetty, hand-in-hand. A young blond woman is standing atop a 
rock overlooking the beach, holding a small dog in one hand and trying 
unsuccessfully to hold her skirt in the howling wind with the other. 
</P>
<P>
Three people, unconnected, walk alone near the shoreline: a young man, a 
middle-aged woman and an older woman. All are walking slowly, hands deep in 
their pockets, mostly looking down at the sand. Two young women in office 
attire take off their shoes and step gingerly into the sand, deep in 
conversation. The water, breaking over the beach, is subdued, grayish blue, 
looking a little angry and surly in the bright sun. 
</P>
<P>
I study Catalina and remember that, as a boy in the Midwest, I was told that if 
I dug a hole deep enough I would emerge in China -- a project I tried 
unsuccessfully a number of times. I wonder if Orange County kids are told that 
if they could swim far enough they would reach China. If so, on this day, they 
could easily believe that Catalina is China -- or maybe kids don't fantasize 
such things any more. 
</P>
<P>
As I get back to my car, a van pulls up and three Asian men -- dressed against 
the elements -- get out. They talk excitedly as they assemble a complex maze of 
fishing gear, then set out across the sand, meeting the workers returning from 
their sack lunch. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I had brought a book and a lawn chair, but instead I must get to work. 
But I'll be back. Not in the summer when a few square inches of sand are hard 
to come by, but in the winter when we have this glorious beach to ourselves and 
can watch it change character with the weather and time of day.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: FRIENDS OF WRITER A DEDICATED BUNCH

When bookseller Ed Thomas received a phone call from best-selling author Dean 
Koontz of Orange last fall inviting him and his wife, Pat, out for dinner that 
night, Thomas should have been tipped off that something was up. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomases, who own Book Carnival in Orange, had become good friends with 
Koontz over the years and they frequently go out to dinner with him and his 
wife, Gerda. But Koontz, the prolific thriller writer dubbed "the Master of 
Menace," is not one to do things on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, Koontz presented the Thomases with an advance galley proof of his 
latest suspense thriller, "Midnight," which he had autographed. After Pat 
Thomas read the inscription, Koontz told her to look above the inscription, at 
the dedication: 
</P>
<P>
"To Ed and Pat Thomas of the Book Carnival who are such nice people that 
sometimes I suspect they're not really human but aliens from another, better 
world." 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked and elated," said Ed Thomas. "There's something about seeing 
your name in a book. Within a few minutes you start realizing your name is 
going to be in every copy of the book that's published. It boggles your mind, 
and especially with the way Dean is selling, I figure there's going to be a lot 
of copies of the book sold." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it looks as though Koontz may have another best-seller on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Book Carnival, which is hosting an autograph party for Koontz from 1 to 4 p.m. 
today, received a large shipment of books to sell at the signing. And in less 
than 2 weeks, the small mystery and science-fiction speciality bookstore at 870 
N. Tustin Ave. had already sold 102 copies of "Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
If past Koontz book signings at Book Carnival are any indication, his fans can 
count on a long wait in line today. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz, in fact, holds the shop record. When he did a signing at the store last 
fall for his new children's book, "Oddkins," he began autographing books at 1 
in the afternoon and, because the line was so long, he didn't finish until 
7:15. In fact, he returned the next day and signed for another 6 hours. In all, 
Thomas sold 500 copies of "Oddkins." 
</P>
<P>
Lest Koontz's fans be bored in line this time around, a magician had been hired 
to keep the crowd entertained. 
</P>
<P>
As for the dedication to the Thomases, Koontz said he normally dedicates his 
books to friends. With a laugh, he said this is the first time that he has 
dedicated a book to friends who also happen to be booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife," he noted, "has received more dedications than anyone, not because 
she's my wife, but because she is my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Book Signing: Anaheim author Valerie King will sign copies of her new Regency 
romance, "A Daring Wager," from 1 to 3 p.m. today at Sunshine Books, 8898 
Valley View St., Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Read Aloud: Jim Trelease, author of "The Read-Aloud Handbook," will discuss 
"reading aloud: motivating children to make books into friends, not enemies" at 
7:30 p.m. Monday in the main auditorium at the First Christian Church of 
Huntington Beach, 1207 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The lecture, in which Trelease will also discuss the influences of excessive 
television viewing, is being sponsored by the Huntington Beach Public Library 
and the Friends of the Children's Library. Tickets are $2 per person and should 
be purchased in advance from the library. Information: (714) 848-7813. 
</P>
<P>
Author Festival: More than 40 authors and illustrators of children's 
literature, who will be speaking at schools in the Huntington Beach and Ocean 
View School districts during the day, will gather at the Huntington Beach 
Central Library from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Thursday to meet their fans and sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scheduled to appear are John Archambault ("Knots on a Counting 
Rope"), John Reynolds Gardiner ("Stone Fox"), Patsy Garrett ("A Walk with Mr. 
Peeps") and Adrienne Jones ("The Hawks of Chelney").
