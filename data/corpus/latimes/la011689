SCHOOL DISPUTE BARES CONFLICT OVER POSTS FOR BLACKS, LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the gray world of affirmative action, it didn't seem like a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Student Attendance and Adjustment Services branch of the Los Angeles School 
District, which deals with children who have personal or social problems, had a 
low-level opening for a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the branch's 14 supervisors were black or Anglo, so it seemed 
logical that the opening would go to a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Madrigal, a 35-year-old counselor, was named acting coordinator of 
student discipline proceedings in October. But a number of the branch's 
counselors were upset with the tentative promotion, because Madrigal was a 
relative newcomer to the district, with only five years service. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the (attendance-counseling) branch has its own Dan Quayle," 
one counselor wrote sarcastically in an anonymous letter to the counselors' 
professional association, which represents about 200 employees. Then the writer 
took note of Madrigal's race. "Where," he asked, "does one try on the magic 
glass huaraches (sandals) to be invited to the ball?" 
</P>
<P>
The association published the letter in its monthly membership flyer in 
November and all hell broke loose. Latinos in the attendance-counseling branch, 
noting that the professional association's board of directors has a majority of 
blacks and no Latinos, called the letter an insensitive racist slur and 
demanded an apology. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the furor ended last month when the school board made Madrigal's 
promotion permanent and chastised the counselors' association for publishing 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
But vibrations are still being felt in informal conversations in many corners 
of the school district. A nerve in the delicate body of interracial coexistence 
has been pricked, and some feelings that had been muted are out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfairness Seen 
</P>
<P>
To some blacks in the attendance-counseling branch, who have complained in the 
past about inconsistent personnel policies, Madrigal's promotion reinforced 
suspicion that Latinos may be receiving unfair promotional benefits, simply 
because they now make up the majority of the children enrolled in Los Angeles 
city schools. 
</P>
<P>
To some Latinos, the criticism of Madrigal's promotion, which came primarily 
from black counselors, reinforced suspicion that blacks are reluctant to extend 
the fruits of affirmative action to other races. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns have important work-place implications in the changing ethnic 
melange that is Southern California. The Madrigal case illustrated a dilemma 
that is occurring with increasing frequency: When affirmative-action promotion 
decisions are made, how does society balance the demands of blacks, who have 
been the earliest beneficiaries of affirmative-action programs, against the 
emerging demands of Latinos, who have made less progress in job advancement and 
appear to be the most in need of remedial advancement because of their swelling 
numbers? 
</P>
<P>
The question surfaced last summer in Los Angeles County government when, over 
the protests of black employees, the Board of Supervisors endorsed a 
controversial study showing that the county has failed to meet its 
affirmative-action goals in hiring and promoting Latinos in the 70,000-member 
county government work force. Blacks contended the report inflated the numbers 
of Latinos in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up 35% of the county's population, but only 18% of the jobs in 
county government. Blacks, by contrast, make up 11% of the population and hold 
30% of the county government jobs -- the majority of them maintenance and 
service positions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, where 57% of the pupils are Latino, 
Latinos hold only 10% of the district jobs requiring teaching credentials -- 
including attendance counseling -- and about 44% of the non-teaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
This type of statistical disparity puts increasing pressure on government 
affirmative-action programs, which were created primarily to compensate for 
past discrimination against blacks and did not anticipate the huge wave of 
Latino migration that has occurred here in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially what most people thought about affirmative action was minorities and 
Caucasians being in competition," said Janeth Smith, chief of human resources 
and benefits for the city of Los Angeles. "Now what we're seeing is different 
minorities in competition." 
</P>
<P>
In the school district's attendance-counseling branch, these abstract concerns 
became uncomfortably real. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a vast chasm over how affirmative action should be carried out," said 
Dr. Donald Martin, a veteran black school district attendance counselor, who 
characterized Madrigal's defenders as "opportunists" -- people willing to 
invoke the sheer weight of Los Angeles' Latino population to justify unfair 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"That flyer has opened up Pandora's box," said Gloria Chavez, president of the 
City Terrace Community Council, an East Los Angeles neighborhood organization 
that bitterly complained to school officials after the letter about Madrigal 
was published, and sent members to a Board of Education meeting to demand that 
his promotion be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said members of her group were angered that they had to expend effort to 
add a Latino to the district's supervisorial ranks, when the need for more 
Latinos -- particularly bilingual ones, like Madrigal -- is so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time anybody pays attention to us is when they see a lot of gang 
killings," she said. "This is going to be a beginning. We want a piece of the 
pie. There are a heck of a lot of us out there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Author Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Blacks make up about 35% of the attendance-counseling branch in the district, 
outnumbering Latinos about 3 to 1. When the letter about Madrigal was 
published, Latinos automatically believed that a black counselor had written 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, leaders of the counselors' association said later, the author was a 
Latino, who remains anonymous. The association's leaders said the writer 
believed that Madrigal was unfairly promoted, thanks to a "buddy" system. 
</P>
<P>
Their explanation did nothing to stifle criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The language was racist, and what makes it worse is that (it) was printed by a 
group that represents counselors who work predominantly with minority kids," 
said Mary Montes, education chairwoman of the City Terrace group and, herself, 
a former school attendance counselor. "They're supposed to help those kids with 
adjustment problems. If they themselves are having trouble dealing with other 
cultures, how are they going to help us with our kids?" 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, both sides tried to play down the racial implications of the 
Madrigal case. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnicity doesn't matter, said Carlos Barron, director of the school 
district's Mexican-American Education Commission, which hears student 
discrimination complaints and functions as an advocacy unit. "It's a 
bread-and-butter issue." 
</P>
<P>
"Our fight isn't with the Hispanics," said Martin, emphasizing that his 
opposition to Madrigal's promotion was based entirely on credentials. "Our 
fight is with a sophisticated group that won't give up one iota . . . The Anglo 
population has a pie, and they'll split it in half, and what's left to dribble 
down has to be divided between African-Americans, Latinos and Asians, and 
nobody's going to give up anything." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the conversation inevitably puts blacks in the awkward position of an 
entrenched group worried about losing ground in the work place as the city's 
Latino population surges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Perceptions Not Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
"These perceptions are not healthy for the entire community," county Supervisor 
Ed Edelman told a public hearing last year on the county report urging more 
Latino hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who has spent more than 25 years in the district as a teacher and 
counselor and prides himself as an independent thinker, suggested that when 
race does enter into affirmative-action decisions, Latinos should not receive 
the same preferences as blacks, because blacks have suffered more severe 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, persons of African descent were the only ones in this country 
who were enslaved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the argument is that the majority of the district's students are Hispanic, 
I'm beginning to say throw out the word 'minority' because the minority has 
become the majority," Martin added. "How can one group with a small percentage 
in the work force achieve the same degree with (blacks), who have twice as many 
in the work force . . . unless you do something unfair?" 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments grate on many Latinos, who say they personify Los Angeles' 
refusal to come to terms with its massive Latino population and its problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't you realize that, by giving Madrigal this position, he's helping more 
kids, kids that you can't reach, kids that you can't relate to, not because 
you're black but because you haven't lived the experience?" Barron said in an 
interview. "Everybody talks about black role models. What about Latino role 
models?" 
</P>
<P>
School Board member Leticia Quezada, who said she was "terribly upset" by the 
"highly unprofessional" publication of the letter criticizing Madrigal's 
promotion, attributed the dissent to the school district's lack of an 
up-to-date affirmative-action program. Too often, affirmative-action promotions 
are "a hit-and-miss effort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Madrigal, too, said he felt his promotion had become ensnared in an ongoing 
argument about the fairness of district promotional processes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some friction" between blacks and Latinos, Madrigal said. "I don't 
know if this situation has caused the friction, or if this situation is a 
manifestation of it."

TAPED 'STING' SHOWS POLICE CLASH WITH BLACK IN ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A network television crew videotaped a Long Beach police officer as he 
apparently pushed a black suspect face first through a hardware store window 
before throwing him onto the trunk of a police car. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect actually was Hawthorne Police Sgt. Don Jackson, a crusader against 
racism within law enforcement. Using himself as bait, Jackson intended to 
illustrate recent complaints of alleged racial brutality in Long Beach by 
catching unsuspecting police officers in a tape-recorded "sting." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a television news crew from NBC's "Today Show," Jackson and 
Jeff Hill, a state corrections officer, had rigged a rental car with sound 
equipment and a hidden video camera. 
</P>
<P>
When the flashing lights of a Long Beach police car lit up the rear-view mirror 
as the two black men cruised down Pacific Coast Highway, it was just what they 
had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Controversy 
</P>
<P>
The traffic stop occurred at 11:30 p.m. Saturday at Pacific Coast Highway and 
Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next remained the focus of controversy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson maintained that he and Hill had violated no traffic laws and that 
neither man offered any resistance at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wearing mechanic's coveralls and had intentionally smeared grease on my 
hands and face to look like I had just crawled out from under a car," Jackson 
said. "I looked dirty and I wasn't driving a nice car, so I guess he (the 
police officer) figured they could do whatever they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, an officer, later identified as Mark Dickey, repeatedly 
swore at him, handcuffed him and threw him head-first into the window of the 
hardware store. The officer also kicked him in the ankles, wrenched his arms 
and fingers and slammed his head into the hood of the police car, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson complained of being sore Sunday but displayed no visible injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Lt. Mike Hill said Dickey and Officer Mark Ramsey, who are 
both white, stopped the car for straddling lanes. Afterward, Jackson assumed a 
"physically hostile posture" and challenged the officers to a fight, the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
While being searched by Dickey, Jackson's elbow shattered the window of a 
hardware store, leaving Dickey with a cut on his hand that required six 
stitches to close, Lt. Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 30, was arrested for allegedly obstructing a police officer and spent 
the night in the Long Beach City Jail. He was released on his own recognizance 
early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hill was issued a traffic citation at the scene and released. 
</P>
<P>
The "Today Show" tape, broadcast Sunday by KNBC News, shows that the car never 
strayed over the center line before the police ordered it to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The heated conversation between Jackson and Dickey clearly is punctuated with 
profanity by the officer, who repeatedly orders Jackson to place his hands on 
top of his head. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson: "What are you talking about, man? You want to write me a ticket, write 
me a ticket. Don't mess with me, man." 
</P>
<P>
Dickey: "Listen, I got a right to pat you down and I'm gonna (expletive) do 
that. I don't know if you've got a knife, or weapon, on you." 
</P>
<P>
"You can pat me down, but don't mess with me, man." 
</P>
<P>
"Turn around and put your (expletive) hands on your head now!" 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Do it 'cause I'm (expletive) telling you to." 
</P>
<P>
"What are you gonna do? You gonna hit me with that stick?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I just might." 
</P>
<P>
"For what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Put your hands on your head!" 
</P>
<P>
"For what?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you've got a (expletive) knife, you (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a knife!" 
</P>
<P>
"Put your (expletive) hands on your head and turn around!" 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the officer cocks his baton and starts to approach Jackson, who 
puts his hands over his head and turns. 
</P>
<P>
The officer then grabs Jackson's hands and, moments later, maneuvers him in 
front of the store window. There, Dickey appears to slam Jackson face first 
into the glass, which shatters. After that, the tape shows Jackson being 
manhandled and thrown onto the trunk of a police car. Jackson can be heard 
screaming in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's group, the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, also videotaped 
the arrest, but it did not capture the incident as well as the NBC version. 
</P>
<P>
"This was consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force . . . and it 
marks a clear point that that department needs to be investigated and needs 
community scrutiny to manage its police officers," Jackson said Sunday. "You 
have clear racist overtones with that department." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police officials disagreed and defended their department as 
impartial when dealing with the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously feel that this situation was set up and we are continuing the 
investigation to see if the people that set it up would also be the subject of 
a criminal complaint," Lt. Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commission Review 
</P>
<P>
After viewing the NBC tape Sunday night, Larry Davis, chairman of Long Beach's 
Public Safety Advisory Commission, said he intends to recommend that Dickey be 
suspended immediately "until this whole issue is investigated. There is no 
place for that kind of activity and excessive force in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The commission is a citizens' group that advises the City Council on police 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been involved in incidents of alleged police mistreatment of blacks 
before. In February, 1988, he accompanied several black youths to Westwood in 
an attempt to prove that minorities were being harassed by Los Angeles police 
in the upscale, predominantly white Westside shopping area. Jackson, who had 
also arranged the videotaping of that incident, was arrested for allegedly 
interfering with officers. The charges eventually were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been on a stress disability leave for two years. He has sued the 
Hawthorne Police Department, claiming his five years on the force were marred 
by "a never-ending stream of racial epithets, taunts and slurs." 
</P>

GUAM'S SILENT ENEMY; 
</P>
<P>
THIS EXOTIC EXTERMINATOR -- THE BROWN TREE SNAKE -- HAS CAUSED A MAJOR 
ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHE ON AN ISLAND ONCE FILLED WITH THE SOUND OF RARE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SY MONTGOMERY, Montgomery is a free-lance writer in Hancock, N.H.

<TEXT>
<P>
On Guam, the tropical Pacific island halfway between Japan and New Guinea, a 
recent survey of hospital emergency room records reads like a horror show 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the case of a 2-month-old baby treated and released in 
March. Her father checked on the sleeping infant at 1 a.m. and found a 5-foot 
snake wrapped around her neck and chewing on her arm. 
</P>
<P>
That same month, a middle-aged woman was treated for a similar problem. Her 
situation rivaled the shower scene in "Psycho": She was sitting on the toilet 
when a snake, entering the house from the septic system, lunged out of the 
water of the toilet bowl and struck her where she least expected it. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's only native snake is a harmless, blind reptile that resembles an 
earthworm. But unbeknown to the military during World War II, ships carrying 
wartime supplies to Guam from Australia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands 
also brought unwanted stowaways: brown tree snakes native to those areas that 
grow to 13 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Without the natural enemies like the predatory birds found in its native lands, 
the snake's numbers on Guam have exploded to more than 6,000 per square mile, 
according to Thomas Fritts, a U.S. fish and wildlife specialist in reptiles. 
And in the space of a few decades, the snakes have eaten almost all of Guam's 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we discovered there was a problem, the snakes were totally out of 
control," said Fritts, who has been studying the snakes in an effort -- 
fruitless so far -- to control their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the brown tree snake is not highly venomous, most people quickly 
recover from bites. But doctors see only part of the problem caused by the 
reptiles. The agile climbers slither up power lines and short-circuit wires, 
causing frequent blackouts that cost Guam millions of dollars a year. Young 
snakes pop out of automobile air-conditioning vents and scare drivers; some of 
the island's 121,000 residents have awakened to find the snakes in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
But worst of all, the nocturnal snakes eat almost anything and can slither 
almost anywhere, including along branches where birds and fruit bats roost, 
into holes where lizards hide and deep into hollow tree crevices where many 
bird species once laid eggs unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
The snakes' victims include two species that existed nowhere else on earth, the 
Guam flycatcher and the Guam rail, both of which were once so abundant they 
were legally hunted. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole time I was on Guam, I never heard a bird sound," said University of 
Connecticut ornithologist Robert Craig, who is studying the bird life of the 
Marianas Islands, which include Guam. It was, he recalls, reminiscent of Rachel 
Carson's book, "Silent Spring": "not a song, not a sound." 
</P>
<P>
Of Guam's 18 species of native birds, at least six have been wiped off the 
island since 1970; Julie Savidge, a University of Nebraska ecologist, has 
watched several of these species disappear during the course of her six-year 
study, while most others have become increasingly rare. "I was shocked at the 
decline," she said. "This is an example showing just how rapidly extinction can 
occur and the devastating effects exotic species can have." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their tree-climbing, night-traveling habits, the snakes went mostly 
unnoticed for the first few decades after they arrived. But today they are so 
numerous and so widespread that "eradication is way out of reach now," Fritts 
said. He estimates that in some areas, there may be as many as 12,000 tree 
snakes per square mile. "But control is possible," Fritts said. "First, we have 
to learn everything we can about the snake to find its weak point." 
</P>
<P>
When Savidge began her study in 1982, no one really thought the snakes were a 
problem. No introduced reptile has been implicated in causing the extinction of 
a native animal. But that the snakes were at fault became quickly apparent as 
Savidge observed the secretive reptile's night feeding habits: She found that 
the snakes eat birds, bird eggs, lizards and small mammals -- even puppies, 
gripping them with powerful constricting muscles and then chewing on them until 
their flesh reaches the back of the snake's mouth, where its venomous fangs 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife researchers are struggling for a solution. Savidge went as far as to 
pass out recipes for snake to people on the streets -- sweet and sour snake, 
snake adobo -- but they never caught on. Besides, Fritts said, the snakes are 
so numerous that even a bounty program probably won't help. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts hopes that further studies of the snake will yield an attracting 
chemical (to use in mass traps), repellent or fumigant. Eventually he hopes to 
establish some snake-free reserves for threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the rails and kingfishers were removed from the wild before they 
became extinct and are now being bred in zoos in hopes of reintroducing them to 
such reserves on Guam some day. But at the moment, efforts are focused on 
preventing the snakes' spread, like a malignant disease, from Guam to other 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Ornithologist Craig is particularly worried about the birds on the other 14 
islands of the Marianas chain. Each island he's visited hosts bird species 
found nowhere else. If the tree snakes arrived on these islands, he said, "the 
loss to science would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unlikely scenario. Within the last 10 years, Fritts said, the 
snakes have shown up twice on Hawaii, and also on Kwajalein, an island 1,000 
miles east of Guam, as well as Diego Garcia, an atoll in the Indian Ocean, and 
the islands of Saipan and Ponapi. All these snakes, which apparently found 
their way onto cargo ships, have either been killed or failed to establish a 
breeding population on these islands. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts and U.S. colleagues have begun offering technical briefings at 
Micronesian and Marianas ports to teach inspectors how to look for the snakes 
in high-risk cargo like junk cars, lumber and government surplus property, 
where the snakes can easily hide. Such inspectors are already trained to look 
for agricultural pests and contraband, Fritts said, "but they aren't trained to 
look for snakes." No one envies them the job, "but somebody has got to do it."

A geologic footprint covering most of western Czechoslovakia may be the imprint 
of an immense object that smashed into Earth millions of years ago, scientists 
said last week. Based on a study of satellite images of central Europe taken 
from 22,500 miles in space, professors Michael Papagiannis and Farouk El-Baz 
said the shape is an apparent crater 200 miles in diameter.

<P>
The researchers, both from Boston University, named the depression "Praha 
Basin" because the city of Praha (Prague) is near its center. The researchers 
presented their study to the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting the crater theory is the recent claim of Czechoslovakian scientists 
that a 30-mile-wide impact formation was found south of Prague. The formation 
is at least 100 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
"The object that could have caused such an impact crater could have been 50 
miles in diameter. It must have begun burning and possibly breaking up as it 
entered the Earth's atmosphere and plunged deeply into the ground," said 
El-Baz. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of such a large object would have been the equivalent of an 
explosion a trillion times more powerful than the atom bomb at Hiroshima," 
Papagiannis said.

The pilot and co-pilot of a Salvadoran jetliner were arrested at Los Angeles 
International Airport on suspicion of attempting to smuggle a cache of firearms 
to El Salvador. Customs agents said they recovered seven semiautomatic pistols 
and a .12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun after receiving a tip from an informant. 
The agents said it was not immediately determined whether the weapons were 
intended for any organized group. Special Customs agent Ed Adamson said the Los 
Angeles office received a tip Friday night saying that the cockpit crew of 
Flight 2511 of TACA International Airlines would be attempting to smuggle guns 
out of this country. Agents found the weapons in luggage being carried by two 
TACA flight attendants. Customs agents boarded the plane shortly before it was 
scheduled to take off and arrested pilot Francisco Jerez, 30, and co-pilot 
Francisco Panameno, 29, without incident. They were booked into the federal 
detention center in downtown Los Angeles on suspicion of violating the 
Neutrality Act, which prohibits the export of weaponry without a State 
Department license. Agents said the flight attendants, who apparently had no 
knowledge of the weapons, were not arrested. The airline had no immediate 
comment.

NEWSMAKERS: THIS TIME, REVIEW GETS THE PLAY

 -- Orson Welles' radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' "War of the Worlds" sent 
chills through American audiences more than 50 years ago. Now, a new Israeli 
play has touched a few raw nerves -- and it has yet to open. Entitled "The 
Leak," the drama, by journalist Matti Golan, describes a fictional Israeli 
prime minister who shoots himself because his embezzlement of government funds 
is soon to be divulged. But when Israel Radio aired a review of parts of the 
play, the station received dozens of phone calls from alarmed citizens. In one 
segment, a sports broadcaster is interrupted with a news flash: "We have to 
stop the broadcast of the basketball game. . . . A report received just now 
says that the prime minister was found tonight dead in his study. His personal 
handgun was on the floor nearby. A police spokesman said there was no doubt 
that the prime minister committed suicide." Ziva Levin, a spokeswoman for the 
Israel Broadcast Authority, said: "We received dozens of phone calls from 
alarmed listeners, in spite of the fact that at the start of the review, we 
warned that the report was only fictional."

 -- President Reagan on Sunday returned to the White House after spending the 
weekend at his Camp David retreat and confirmed that he is weighing a full 
pardon for Patty Hearst, whose conviction for bank robbery had been commuted on 
Jan. 19, 1979, by President Jimmy Carter. A full pardon would wipe Hearst's 
official record clean. "I've asked everybody to look into this for me," Reagan 
said. The Times two weeks ago reported that the Hearst case was one of several 
controversial pardons being considered by the President. David C. Stephenson, 
the Justice Department's pardon attorney, is said to be reviewing the case. The 
newspaper heiress was kidnaped and held hostage by the Symbionese Liberation 
Army, a terrorist group, and was convicted in 1974 for helping the group rob a 
San Francisco bank.

 -- British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher issued a challenge to women, 
calling on them to skirt male prejudices in order to attain key public offices. 
Interviewed in the British magazine She, at a time when sex discrimination is 
reported to be widespread in the country's business community, Thatcher said: 
"I want . . . a far bigger proportion of women for . . . public office. There 
must be so many clever, capable women out there that we do not know about, who 
have control of budgets in their companies, who would be every bit as splendid 
as men in public office." Thatcher, chosen in 1979 as her country's first 
female prime minister, presides over an all-male Cabinet. JAMES MARNELL

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST NORTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fortuitous conjunction (on your Op-Ed Page, Jan. 9) of Cal Thomas' 
excellent expose of Jim and Tammy Bakker and Conrad's cartoon showing Reagan 
and Bush toasting North's brilliantly manipulative lawyer (Brendan Sullivan) 
drove me panting to my word processor. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas quotes C.S. Lewis: "The safest road to hell is the gradual one . . . 
without signposts." Sullivan's self-righteous jerking around of the legal 
system is both embarrassing and to be feared. This blatant manipulation of the 
legal system has only one purpose -- freeing an admittedly guilty man. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the outgoing Administration has a well-earned reputation for 
defending the clearly guilty. 
</P>
<P>
A thought for our times might be: "If it glitters, if you believe it in your 
heart, and if you can get away with it, it must be right." And, oh yes, we need 
people of stature to lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
With people like Jim and Tammy and Sullivan and North leading us on the path of 
righteousness, we should arrive in hell no worse for the stress and trouble of 
getting there.

Having just read your article proclaiming Seattle the "hub of a booming Pacific

"Bankruptcy filings continue to set records in Seattle, home to one of the

PLIGHT OF THE RETARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not so many years ago large state hospitals for the mentally retarded were 
often dungeons of despair. Now the apparently humane option of community care 
is itself turning sour. In too many privately run but state-financed homes the 
retarded face physical abuse, poor diet, neglect or financial exploitation. 
State government clearly must return to the question of how best to care for 
the retarded, and must do so soon. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer John Hurst has documented case after case of neglect, even 
death, among the retarded housed in privately operated centers. In one 1987 
case, for example, a 29-year-old woman living in a community-care home west of 
downtown Los Angeles died of a neglected abdominal infection. Five months later 
the center's license was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Some homes are run by well-motivated people attempting to stretch limited 
funds. They need the discipline of frequent inspections and help in learning 
what corners simply cannot be cut. Other homes are run by out-and-out schemers 
who shortchange patients and pocket the difference. State social-service 
agencies must actively monitor all the care for which California pays, stiffen 
the penalties against those who exploit and abuse, and put those who persist in 
shabby practice out of business. 
</P>
<P>
There are two fundamental problems in grappling with the issue of caring for 
the retarded. One is financial, the other philosophical. It costs money to 
provide inspectors and social workers to monitor such programs. California is 
already in a financial bind, and a state that once was an innovator in social 
services cannot, for now, respond to all legitimate demands on its dollars. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that the current system of paying private nonprofit regional centers 
to place the retarded in community homes has simply facilitated buck-passing. 
State agencies can say that an incorrect placement isn't their fault. The state 
should finance some small pilot projects to see whether its own staff could do 
a better job at both placement and management of community care programs and to 
determine how much that would cost. 
</P>
<P>
California government has made a philosophical commitment to help the retarded 
live in community settings rather than large hospitals. In an ideal world, 
that's the best approach. But Hurst's interviews showed that many parents find 
state hospital care for their children vastly improved and safer than the worst 
of community-care homes. Honoring a general commitment to community care is not 
a good reason to ignore the fact that for some individuals state hospitals are 
more suitable. 
</P>
<P>
Debate on care for the retarded should be reopened. The discussion should focus 
on how to fashion care to fit individual needs and on deciding how California 
can best provide that care. Such a debate would benefit both the state and its 
citizens who are retarded and often ill served today.

It is with profound regret, therefore, that I now read that independent counsel

POLL ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only the tobacco industry could have the gall to poll 1,500 adults (less than 
one in 100,000 or exactly 30 per state) and announce that a "majority" of 
Americans do not support higher cigarette taxes or tougher anti-smoking 
legislation (Tobacco Institute ad, Business, Jan. 9). 
</P>
<P>
If so, how come Proposition 99 passed despite a massive and misleading campaign 
by tobacco companies? 
</P>
<P>
The statistics showing the damage and financial burdens smokers inflict on 
others as well as themselves are too dreary and familiar to bear repeating -- 
not that they'd impress an industry that still denies smoking causes lung 
cancer.

POSITIVE STEP ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The preliminary passage of a Los Angeles County anti-discrimination ordinance, 
protecting those with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, 
is a constructive step. It would put into effect the implementation of a key 
recommendation of the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Rand Schrader, vice chairman of the county AIDS Commission, 
urged passage of the ordinance because it makes "clear and unequivocal" the 
position of the Board of Supervisors, just as the Los Angeles City Council made 
its position clear in 1985 with the adoption of a municipal anti-discrimination 
law. He was right. And making that clear in the county is of particular 
importance because the county ranks second in the nation in the incidence of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was by the narrowest possible margin, however, with Supervisors Pete 
Schabarum and Mike Antonovich voting in opposition. The majority of three was 
made up of Supervisors Deane Dana, Kenneth Hahn and Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs that the opposition was based on misunderstandings. Antonovich 
argued that it would duplicate federal and state laws. He had perhaps forgotten 
that the radical right forced out of federal legislation proposals for broad 
protections against discrimination and that Gov. George Deukmejian had vetoed 
state legislation last October that would have extended protections to those 
who test positive to the virus but who may not yet have AIDS. Protection of 
those with the virus but without symptoms of the disease is an important 
provision of the county ordinance. Furthermore, it was argued that this would 
be a costly venture when, in fact, it will not be because it provides only for 
recourse to the civil courts or the county dispute-resolution program in the 
event of violations. 
</P>
<P>
The community will be well served if the supervisors can now move ahead on 
other critical questions related to the AIDS pandemic. Until now, there has not 
been majority support for more candid informational programs targeted on 
high-risk populations. And only Edelman of the five supervisors thus far has 
supported the proposal of the county AIDS Commission for a campaign directed at 
intravenous drug users that would include the distribution of bleach for 
cleaning needles and of condoms to encourage safer sex. These programs have 
been proved effective in other communities, and delays in their implementation 
only raise the risk of an accelerated spread of the infection.

MARYLOUISE OATES: A GLITTERY, MILLION-DOLLAR PARTY OF A LIFETIME FOR 1,000 
CLOSE FRIENDS

<P>
Great parties are not like trolley cars or men. If you miss a good one, another 
one is not likely to be by in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
So too bad if you missed the massive, maddeningly marvelous (and probably close 
to a million-dollar) bash Fred Hayman threw Saturday night. Always a 
perfectionist and a stylish showman, Hayman brought together 1,000 of his 
closest friends, a handful of California's best restaurants, took over an 
entire sound stage, added the sets from the film "Phantom of the Opera" in the 
entrance way and gave away a $25,000 door-prize-of-your-life vacation at Paris' 
Plaza Athenee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a party you won't see twice," said a Chaneled Jane Nathanson, who 
should know because she hosted the multiacclaimed Armani party at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art last January. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so glad I'm here," said Jill Halverson, director of the Downtown Women's 
Center, to May Co. veep Jim Watterson, both of whom are active with Hayman on 
projects for the homeless, to which Hayman has contributed more than $1 million 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, let me spray you!" ordered Patti Skouras, one of the cabal of the 
cognoscenti who were the "fragrance panel" for Hayman's new scent, 273. The 
launching of the perfume, plus the renaming of his landmark Rodeo Drive store 
as "Fred Hayman Beverly Hills," was the purpose of the party. Brilliant yellow 
with a red signature appeared on balloons, tables, sweat shirts of the valet 
parkers and even the tulip centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
"This reminds me of Berkeley in the '60s," quipped investment counselor Jim 
Birdwell, making his way through the crowd with his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Chasen's?" said Barry Kaye to Jimmy's Peter Luda. Jimmy's, the Bistro, 
Bistro Garden, Spago, La Scala, the Grill and, of course, Chasen's had all 
provided their specialties, and their regulars patiently queued up, unmindful 
of black-tie and spangles. 
</P>
<P>
For one night only, Hayman, there with steady Betty Endo, had managed to 
transform a Universal sound stage into a little, diamond-crusted piece of 
Beverly Hills. And he assembled the most mixed-media guest list since the 
Olympics. Top party-goers were on hand -- Virginia and Gerald Oppenheimer 
chatting with Maude Chasen and Henry and Jayne Berger, Ellen and Bernie Byrens 
(she in a knockout Bill Blass) greeting Teddy Orgell, Richard and Geri 
Brawerman (in a spangled Bill Blass jacket copied from a Matisse) and Henry and 
Sedge Plitt. 
</P>
<P>
Glamour girls like Shirlee Fonda, Frances Bergen, Altovise Davis, Vanna White 
and Connie Selleca were there, along with Jackie and Sydney Rosenberg, designer 
Jack Lowrance, Doris Fields Heller with the Westwood Marquis' Jacques Camus, 
who is hosting Franco and Anne Marie Cozzo of the Plaza Athenee, who came from 
Paris just to present the door prize. 
</P>
<P>
And, for those into social fortunetelling, the drawing was a symbolic end to 
the Reagan era. Bernice Brown came up the winner of the UTA first-class air 
fare for two to Paris and a week in a suite at what Hayman described as "the 
most wonderful hotel in the world." As her husband, former Gov. Pat Brown, 
cheered, Bernice went on stage. "Oh my God," Hayman greeted her, with a look of 
happy surprise, then shook his head vigorously as she asked: "Do you want to 
take it back?" 
</P>
<P>
Other well-known Democrats were in attendance, like songwriters Marilyn and 
Alan Bergman (who, with Marvin Hamlisch, wrote a special song for the occasion, 
"We Go So Well Together"); Roz Wyman (with Republican John Berl) talking with 
Bob and Sally Burkett; Mickey Ziffren (in a slinky black dress) with her 
brother-in-law, Leo; Atty. Gen. John and Andrea Van de Kamp chatting with Marc 
Nathanson; Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his wife, Judge Diane Wayne; State 
Comptroller Gray and Sharon Davis, and Lisa Specht and Ron Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Reagan, in pink, headed the list of well-known Republicans. (Earlier in 
the week, Hayman had sent Nancy Reagan the first bottle of 273, with a note 
welcoming her back to the neighborhood.) Mary and Brad Jones were there, as was 
Giney Milner with Jim Wharton. 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Wanda Henderson was there in a feathered hat and boa: "I molt at 
midnight, darling." Elaine Goldsmith was in a striking black and red gown, the 
one she, as a faithful board member, bought at the Otis/Parsons student fashion 
show last year. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown types were there: City Council president John and Margaret Ferraro 
chatted with attorney Neil Papiano and Sharon Thralls. Entertainment types: 
Ricardo and Georgiana Montalban and Columbia Television's Gary and Anne 
Lieberthal, Charlton and Lydia Heston, Henry and Ginny Mancini (after their 
successful Music Center party Friday night), and Alan Carr with Wendy Stark, as 
well as Burt Sugarman and Mary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the restaurant mavens: Jimmy and Anne Murphy (she in a purple 
ruffled gown "which Fred did"), the Bistro's Kurt Niklas and Ini Asman, lining 
up for some Spago food from Wolfgang Puck (perhaps the happiest man in 
attendance, because his glamorous wife, Barbara Lazeroff, expects their first 
baby in May). 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant Joe Cerrell, with the warm smile he gets at the approach 
of the USC Marching Band, asked cutely: "I want to know if anyone ever has seen 
the UCLA Marching Band?" Everyone at the party had a special connection to 
Hayman. Cerrell said that when Hayman was at the Beverly Hilton, he did all the 
Democratic political dinners: "He even did Lee's and my wedding on Nov. 17, 
1963. And he left the Hilton the next day." 
</P>
<P>
As the big band left the stage, as the jazz club was set up in a tent where the 
Beluga caviar and Chasen's chili were served as appetizers, before the 
dozen-plus "dirty dancers" did their routine, and the quartet of rock 'n' roll 
women singers took over the stage -- Fred Hayman thanked his friends "for a 
brilliant evening." 
</P>
<P>
This is, he said, "the American dream." And there was probably not a party-goer 
who would argue with that.

ON YOUR OWN: THE OUTGOING HAVE INCOME CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been looking back over the past year's columns to see which had the 
greatest response from readers. In May I printed a letter from Doug, 36, who 
declared, "There are not enough single women to go around for all the single 
men." He described himself in positive terms: "I was popular in high school and 
college and had no trouble getting dates. My close male friends will attest to 
the soundness of my character. At work my associates think I am witty, 
intelligent and well-read. I think my looks are above average. Even though I 
hold a responsible position as a technical writer, I admit my income is not 
that impressive." 
</P>
<P>
After he described his futile efforts to connect with women, he said: "I can 
only conclude that when single women complain that there are not enough single 
men, they mean single men who make more than $50,000 a year and look like 
models in GQ. The rest of us guys appear to be a glut on the market." 
</P>
<P>
I told Doug that I have heard this complaint from other men who say that a 
man's income is an important consideration to some women when they select a 
partner. At the same time, there are women who are more interested in a man's 
personality and character than how much money he makes. I also told Doug and 
other men with similar concerns that if they look around they will find men 
with the same occupations and income range who have close and committed 
relationships with women. I advised Doug and the others not to lose heart. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that column, a woman reader said: "I can't tell you how angry 
your response made me. Basically, you told Doug that for many women their 
interest in a man is directly related to his income! I have never asked a man 
how much money he earns. Frankly, I think that information is personal. All my 
single friends feel the same way. We are all attractive, intelligent and 
fun-loving. Most women are not such superficial opportunists. Many of us care 
about a man's deeper qualities such as his sense of humor, sensitivity and 
dependability." 
</P>
<P>
And a woman from Indiana said: "Although Doug's sense of frustration is 
understandable, please reassure him that there are many women who have learned 
to value men as people and not just as providers. Because many of us do not fit 
the ideal image of the 'perfect' woman (gorgeous, talented, etc.), we have 
developed inner qualities and values that do not view men in such a shallow and 
superficial vein. Could it be that Doug is so busy chasing after the top 5% of 
women who fit that perfect bill that he has failed to see the other women who 
can give him the very things he seeks?" 
</P>
<P>
That may be, although Doug said: "Before you warn me about the dangers of 
pursuing models or beauty queens, I would like to add that I am talking about 
average-looking women. My standards are about as broad and flexible as I can 
make them." 
</P>
<P>
You might ask: What is the relationship between a man's income and his 
desirability? Are men being cynical if they think that most women give a higher 
priority to a potential mate's income than his other qualities? Are women being 
naive if they think most women believe a man's income is of little importance? 
</P>
<P>
Here is an experiment for you to try: 
</P>
<P>
Pass out copies of the following description to a group of single women: "John 
is 35. He is quite good-looking, keeps in shape at a health club and plays 
tennis regularly. He is intelligent, has a good sense of humor and a wide range 
of interests. He is warm and sensitive, and when he cares for a woman, he can 
be very romantic and tuned-in to her feelings. Right now he is interested in a 
relationship that will lead to marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Give half the group the description in which the next sentence reads: "He 
manages the haberdashery department in a large department store and has an 
income of slightly more than $20,000 a year." Give the other half the 
description in which the next sentence reads: "He is the executive vice 
president of a chain of department stores and his income is well over six 
figures." 
</P>
<P>
The last sentence in both descriptions reads: "If you would like to meet him, 
indicate below how he may contact you." If you try this experiment, do it 
carefully. Do not give any hints that the descriptions are different. See what 
kind of results you get and let me know. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions and statements about the single life may be addressed to Howard 
Halpern in care of Special Features, 130 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 10011.

VIENNA: THE UNDERSIDE OF GEMUTLICHKEIT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek, translated from the German by Joachim 
Neugroschel (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: $18.95 280 pages) 
</P>
<P>
If your Vienna is a meld of Sachertorte, prancing Lippizaners, pristine ski 
slopes and Strauss waltzes, kiss all those visions goodby when you open "The 
Piano Teacher." Elfriede Jelinek, who won the coveted Heinrich Boll Prize for 
her contribution to German literature, has written a corrosive novel of 
contemporary Viennese life, showing the festering underside of Gemutlichkeit; a 
netherworld of masochism, oppression, and violence in which no romantic 
illusions can survive the first chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily symbolic and bleakly realistic, "The Piano Teacher" turns its female 
protagonist, Erika Kobut, into an extended metaphor for a doomed society. 
</P>
<P>
An instructor at Vienna's venerable Music Conservatory, Erika at 36 lives in a 
cramped, decaying flat with a mother old enough to be her grandmother. By now 
her dreams of a career on the concert stage have shriveled into the dreary 
routine of giving lessons to bored adolescents forced to study music for no 
better reason than the fact that they're in Vienna, where music had evolved 
into a state religion. To ignore it is to be a heretic, and so Erika's students 
sullenly go through the motions, impatient for the day when they can abandon 
the pretense forever. 
</P>
<P>
For Erika, dominated since birth by her fiercely demanding and pathologically 
possessive mother, that day of liberation will never arrive. The only 
concessions Erika has gained are her armchair and a closet full of gaudy 
dresses she will never wear. Mother and daughter share a bed, not out of 
poverty, devotion or even loneliness, but because a woman with a bed of her own 
might be tempted to test its potential. Eventually, a bed might lead to an 
apartment, to freedom, and to marriage, and then where would Erika's mother be? 
</P>
<P>
To all intents and purposes, Erika is a prisoner, furloughed only to teach her 
classes; her return calculated to the split second; her absences monitored by 
telephone. From time to time, her pent-up rage erupts in ugly scenes of assault 
and battery, mother and daughter flailing at one another and tearing out clumps 
of hair, then making up with TV and bonbons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Outlets 
</P>
<P>
Despite the constant surveillance, Erika has managed a few outlets for her 
frustration. In her rare moments of solitude, she slices into her flesh with a 
razor blade, sometimes varying the torment by attaching clothespins to her body 
and sticking herself with pins. Often, she lies to her mother about a late 
pupil or a changed hour, and goes off alone to a squalid porno parlor 
patronized by foreign laborers, where she pays her admission to a tiny cubicle 
and watches the nude women exhibit themselves. Other nights, she wanders 
through Vienna's park with binoculars, spying on prostitutes and their clients. 
Graphic and unnerving, these episodes are calculated to demonstrate and 
underscore the parallels between Erika's carefully preserved and wholly 
artificial air of propriety and the equally false charm and decorum of Vienna 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
This degrading cycle is broken when one of Erika's students, a conceited 
self-styled bon vivant named Walter Klemmer, becomes obsessed with his prim 
teacher; his interest fueled by her apparent unavailability. Confronted by an 
actual male presence, Erika's precarious mental balance tips into psychosis, 
and her covert sexual practices finally become uncontrollable, driving the 
novel to a violent and scarifying climax. 
</P>
<P>
Though not for the faint-hearted or the squeamish, "The Piano Teacher" is 
compelling fiction, ensnaring the reader with the intensity of the author's 
vision and the bitter irony she uses to present her view of the city. The prose 
is disarmingly colloquial, the work of a gifted translator who has carefully 
preserved the stylistic nuances of the original German and the black humor 
inherent in Erika's bizarre encounters. 
</P>
<P>
Passionately political under its dense mantle of sexual imagery, the novel 
shares the dark world view long common to Eastern European literature and now 
increasingly evident in books from ostensibly more fortunate countries, 
insistently calling our attention to the discrepancy between the Vienna of our 
fantasies and the one in which Jelinek lives.

A TALE ABOUT FEMINISM AT AN EARLY AGE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aurora's Motive by Erich Hackl, translated from the German by Edna McCown 
(Knopf: $15.95; 117 pages) 
</P>
<P>
This novel is based on the true story of Aurora Rodriguez, who killed her only 
daughter, Hildegart, age 17, on April 11, 1931, in Madrid. The author, in a 
fictional "re-creation" of the story, endeavors, as the title suggests, to 
uncover the motive for such a heinous crime, but succeeds only in telling the 
story -- which may be, in a sense, more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, such a crime is impossible to understand: The blurb-writers here 
describe it as "mother-love and feminism gone mad," which is about as murky a 
description of what happened as the trial lawyers managed when the dreadful 
event occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Aurora's Motive" is short, scary and hair-raising, a parable about the 
impotence of the individual always at the mercy of steamroller society; a muted 
question put to the reader about the ethics of suicide, murder, human survival. 
(In literary terms this harks back to "The Ordeal of Richard Feverel," in which 
a hapless young man is so relentlessly educated by his determined father that 
the desperate, put-upon young man comes down with brain fever and dies), and 
Horace McCoy's "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?," in which an aging, would-be 
actress, exhausted from a dance marathon and from life itself, begs her partner 
to murder her and put her out of her misery. He does -- and is that murder or 
is it mercy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set in Border Town 
</P>
<P>
Aurora's story begins in the Spanish harbor town of El Ferrol. As the turn of 
the century rolls by, Aurora grows up the daughter of a shrewish mother 
obsessed by bourgeois conventions. Her father lounges at his club and is best 
described as a parlor socialist, spouting notions about how the lower classes 
are exploited in Spanish society; how women are oppressed (by the obligation to 
produce children by the dozen; by their inability to make a living, survive on 
their own and so on and so on). 
</P>
<P>
No one in the family really listens to all this except Aurora, who makes the 
fatal mistake of taking her father seriously. If women and the lower classes 
are so oppressed by a stifling society -- very well; she will do what she can 
to change this condition. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora refuses to marry. She advertises in the local papers for a man to father 
her child (and just as inevitably as if she were looking for a used car, she 
inadvertently picks a lemon). Then she begins single-handedly the mad 
"education" of the girl child who is born to her. 
</P>
<P>
Modern American parents may wince at some of this, especially since this is a 
true story. Good old Hildegart is bombarded with flash cards and maps and 
alphabet blocks. She becomes a certified typist by the time she is 3, so that 
she can join her mother in the composition of socialist monographs. Hildegart 
knows absolutely everything there is to know about sexual reproduction by the 
time she's 4, but of course her mother never gives her a single hug or allows 
her to play with other children. Affection is part and parcel of bourgeois 
society, Aurora argues, and other children harbor the values of that society as 
surely as they carry germs or measles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Author Goes Awry 
</P>
<P>
Here, though, the reader may balk. What is the author getting at? Isn't it his 
duty as an artist to point out the general dopiness of this theory, which is 
fed to us one way or another, incessantly, in movies, after-school specials and 
high-tone novels: "Either you're smart, or you're loving, you can't be both," 
or, for women, an alternate "Either, or conundrum: Either you're a happy wife 
and mom, or you're a disciplined career woman, or you're a stressed-out 
looney-tune who tries to "have it all," and inevitably, fails. Wouldn't the 
author like to say a few words on this subject, considering he's writing about 
"feminism gone mad?" No, he wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Hildegart discovers men when she's 17. She's wooed by H. G. Wells, who 
wants to introduce her to Havelock Ellis, the internationally known sexologist. 
Her mother, incapable of love, takes to jealousy. Facing the possible loss of 
her daughter, she shoots her dead. This is a cautionary tale, but against what? 
Do we keep the kids away from the word processor until their age hits double 
digits? Can't we hug them and teach them to be useful members of society at the 
same time? Must education lead to certain -- and early -- death?

Speaking of trees, famed graphic artist Peter Max donated an original 
acrylic-on-canvas painting portraying two trees to Mayor Tom Bradley, who 
accepted the Max original on behalf of TreePeople, a Los Angeles-based 
conservation group that is organizing a program to plant as many as 5 million 
trees across the city over the next five years. Though TreePeople officials 
have yet to decide what to do with the painting, it will either be used as a 
symbol for the planting campaign or auctioned to help raise money for the 
multimillion dollar effort. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN

Exhibition planners in Hartford, Conn., went out on a limb in hanging a 
familiar painting by Georgia O'Keeffe upside-down from its usual position, but 
a curator says that's what the artist wanted. The Wadsworth Atheneum owns the 
1929 painting, "The Lawrence Tree," and hung it with the tree extending from 
the lower right-hand corner of the canvas. However, the painting has been part 
of a traveling retrospective of O'Keeffe's work organized by the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington and until now has been hung with the base of the 
tree at the top left corner. A Wadsworth's curator said when O'Keeffe sold the 
painting to the atheneum she indicated it could be hung in any direction. The 
painting depicts a ponderosa pine O'Keeffe encountered on D. H. Lawrence's 
Taos, N.M., ranch. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN

Billie Holiday's "Lover Man," Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land" and the 
Charlie Parker Sextet's "Ornithology" top the list of new inductees for the 
Grammy Hall of Fame. Two classical performances were also selected: a 1940 
recording titled "Bartok: Contrasts fo Violin, Clarinet and Piano" featuring 
composer Bela Bartok on piano, Joseph Szigeti on violin and Benny Goodman on 
clarinet, and a 1955 recording of Beethoven's piano concertos Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 
and 5 with pianist Arthur Schnabel and conductor Malcolm Sargent. Formal 
induction will take place at the Grammy Awards ceremony Feb. 22 at the Shrine 
Auditorium. The hall of fame awards were established to honor recordings made 
before formation of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Science's

"Gone With the Wind" will be playing in theaters across the country this year 
to celebrate its golden anniversary. MGM/UA is booking the 1939 classic in 
select theaters to give fans "the rare chance to view the film in its original 
glory and splendor," says Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer. "GWTW" 
will be shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Feb. 11 as a benefit 
for the museum's film department. The tab: $75. The re-release engagement of 
the film will begin at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Jan. 30-31.

Conductor Daniel Barenboim has been fired as artistic director of the new Paris 
Opera de la Bastille after a salary dispute, but the new so-called "People's 
Opera" was plunged into deeper trouble Sunday when the man contracted to direct 
its first production resigned in sympathy with the sacked artistic director. 
Barenboim was dismissed when he refused to take a cut in his $1.1-million 
salary. The 46-year-old Argentine-born conductor and pianist also angered the 
new Socialist government with a program regarded as too highbrow for the Opera 
de la Bastille. Patrice Chereau, who had been scheduled to direct Mozart's Don 
Giovanni when the opera opens this summer, quit over the weekend and said that 
other international music figures may now refuse to work with the Opera. 
Chereau called Barenboim's firing by Pierre Berge, director of Paris's three 
opera houses and chairman of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, 
"despicable." The new opera is built on the site of the Bastille prison, the 
battleground of the French revolution 200 years ago. The opera is scheduled to 
open on the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789.

DANCE REVIEW;

GARTH FAGAN'S BUCKET DANCE AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garth Fagan is one of the great reformers in American dance: a choreographer 
who has redefined and updated black dance but also a teacher who has extended 
modern-dance virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaican-born, and now based in Rochester, N.Y., Fagan draws movement 
influences from his rich American and pre-American heritage -- but evidently 
has no use for show business traditions and priorities. Thus the two programs 
presented by Fagan's splendid 13-member Bucket Dance company, Friday and 
Saturday in Royce Hall, UCLA, utterly bypassed the limited notions that 
audiences often pick up of black style, black attitude, black energy, black 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Fagan's "Traipsing Through the May" (on the Saturday program) included 
a wicked parody of one bedrock cliche of the idiom: the terminally glamorous 
star (Valentina Alexander) dramatically swirling her long, long skirt. And his 
suite "Never Top 40" (Friday), pointedly suggested that blackness is more than 
skin deep by collecting lush melodies from across the centuries and then 
claiming them all through choreography of kaleidoscopic, multicultural variety 
that wore its "mainstream" postmoderisms no less proudly than its "minority" 
Afro-Caribbeanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan's sophistication as a structuralist allows him to make the choreographic 
process transparent -- to show "random" movement ideas linking up like an 
add-a-pearl necklace in the opening of "Time After Before Place" (both 
programs), for example. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, Fagan seems to use this skill to prevent the disruptive, 
premature audience outbursts that sometimes pass for dance appreciation. Corps 
excursions overlap showy solo passages and the endings of his works often 
deliberately subside. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Fagan technique demands some of the most spectacular balances in 
contemporary dance but only occasionally do his dancers cut loose for purposes 
of display. Fagan named the most conventional showpiece in his UCLA repertory 
"Discipline Is Freedom" (Friday), and you feel the title could serve as the 
personal motto for any member of his company. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegiac group vehicle "Landscape for 10" (Friday), postmodern spatial 
and sequencing gambits, Third World and New York vocabularies and Fagan's 
enlightened social and sexual convictions all fuse in dancing of the highest 
achievement and deepest commitment. But this is not an engulfing experience; it 
aims for something far more complex. Fagan is here making a statement about 
relationships, and he carefully gives same-sex partnering absolute parity. He 
also reverses the conventional power structure of male-female duets, demanding 
a strength from his women and a refinement from his men that few companies 
anywhere could match. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought that male adagio dancing couldn't be more sensitively masterful 
than in Paul Taylor's "Roses," think again. Fagan keeps his men modulating in 
and out of impossible radically cantilevered, asymmetrical extensions and then 
smoothly shifting into his characteristic bursts of up-tempo counterpoint. 
Normally, when a choreographer needs this kind of sustained control, he uses 
women. Fagan has created an instrument with no such limits. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you could argue that Norwood Pennewell is his ideal interpreter. 
Throughout both programs, but especially in the somber "Passion Distanced" 
(Saturday), Pennewell's restrained quality of expression and steady energy-flow 
almost allowed you to grow complacent about the fabulous versatility and 
precision of his dancing, the way his absorption in the choreography made you 
see it (and not just him) more clearly. 
</P>
<P>
There were times on each program when Fagan's obsession with discontinuity 
threatened to fragment everything a piece had achieved. But without exception, 
Pennewell and his colleagues helped you through, kept you involved, left you 
satisfied. If Fagan's choreography is sometimes compelling primarily for the 
sense of creative integrity and risk it reveals, his dancers are simply as good 
at what they do as anyone anywhere.

POP CAPS : HARRIS: MAINSTREAM IS WHAT THE LADY DOES BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emmylou Harris began the first of her two shows Saturday night at the Ventura 
Theatre with a lively toast to the recent career resurgence of fellow country 
star Buck Owens. 
</P>
<P>
While the spunky version of Owens' old "Love's Gonna Live Here" was a nice 
gesture, it would have been just as fitting for Harris to have opened with one 
of the tunes from her own mid-'70s albums -- works that established her as 
arguably the most evocative female singer ever in country music. Harris, too, 
seems on the edge of a career resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Owens, Harris hasn't fallen from the charts, but she lost some momentum 
on record in recent years as she moved from her once inspiring mix of 
mainstream country material (drawn from classic country songwriters like Don 
Gibson and contemporary ones such as Rodney Crowell) to specialized projects of 
narrower thematic focus. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerable daring in the occasional sidesteps into bluegrass and 
concept albums, but Harris -- unlike the countless artists who dilute their 
strengths when reaching for a wider audience -- actually gains in character and 
impact as she moves to the mainstream. She is blessed with such strong artistic 
vision and vocal purity that she becomes more affecting as her themes become 
more universal and her melodies more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Harris returns to the earlier strengths in her just-released "Bluebird" album 
-- her most convincing mainstream effort in years. "Heaven Only Knows," a 
richly melodic fool-in-love lament, and two other songs from the album sounded 
like vintage Harris when slipped alongside her more familiar tunes in 
Saturday's hour-plus set. 
</P>
<P>
The only disappointment, in fact, was that she didn't do more songs from the 
new album at the Ventura, a former movie theater that has been converted to a 
club, complete with tables and chairs. Harris and the seven-piece Hot Band 
continue their Southern California tour with shows tonight and Tuesday at the 
Crazy Horse in Santa Ana. ROBERT HILBURN

SYMPHONY REVIEW;

<P>
UNDER SHAW'S BATON, CONCERT WAS ODE TO JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenges of presenting a monument such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are 
legion. Too much reverence may induce somnolence, but a jaunty approach risks 
reducing lofty aspirations to catchy jingles. Even in its own era, the "Choral" 
Symphony's naive, homely themes invited critical derision as mere back alley 
tunes. It takes a seasoned hand to shape this mighty, sprawling work and probe 
the depth of the composer's vision. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the San Diego Symphony secured the services of Robert Shaw to 
conduct the local orchestra and San Diego Master Chorale in the Ninth. Still 
effervescent and curious as he approaches his 72nd year, Shaw brought the best 
of both worlds to his conducting. The Atlanta Symphony's conductor laureate 
displayed the vigor of a youthful spirit and the security of a mature 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Symphony Hall the Shaw trademarks were evident in abundance: 
crisp diction from the chorus and precise rhythmic inflection from both singers 
and instrumentalists; brisk but not breakneck tempos, and a broad palette of 
finely-tuned dynamic levels. Most rewarding to the listener was the dramatic 
tension he built from the opening phrase of every movement, which he carefully 
tended and sustained through the widest arches of the composer's architecture. 
He conducted as if no motif were superfluous and every idea had a unique 
calling in the ultimate scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If such analyses appear unduly fussy, it is only because the level of 
conducting practiced on this orchestra's podium over the last two seasons 
leaves so much to be desired from the twin perspectives of technique and 
inspiration. Guest conductors routinely drive through scores on auto pilot, or 
engage in displays of cute choreography that add nothing to the music but 
visual distraction. Shaw's solid stance and clean-cut motions put the prancers 
and dancers to shame. 
</P>
<P>
It was a great night for the Master Chorale, which sounded fresh and 
enthusiastic after sitting through the lengthy opening movements. Slightly 
augmented with additional voices for this concert, the chorale gave the maestro 
the lithe, disciplined sound he asked for. Their German was more than 
recognizable, but their timbre lacked richness and they did not muster a 
thrilling forte. But they have room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the orchestra put its best foot forward for Shaw. Execution of those 
delicate little fugues for strings, especially in the second movement, exposed 
those sections' lack of precision and nervous entrances. Surprisingly, the 
usually reliable cellos fell short of tonal perfection in their solos at the 
opening of the finale. However, the orchestra's solid ensemble and well-focused 
energy left an overriding positive impression. 
</P>
<P>
Among the quartet of vocal soloists, bass-baritone Terry Cook's stentorian 
lyricism and soprano Lorna Haywood's luminous, arched phrases made solid 
impressions. Tenor Jon Garrison sounded a trifle forced, and mezzo Shirley Love 
seemed unduly buried by the other voices, although the entire quartet was 
placed at the far side of the stage -- hardly a favorable position from which 
to sing over the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw opened the evening with the overture from Bach's Third Orchestral Suite. 
Oddly, he reduced the number of players for the Bach, then urged them to push 
out more volume. This notion was not successful; it only made the Baroque work 
sound tense and distorted. For the Beethoven it was an unnecessary prelude.

'RYAN WHITE' TELLS COURAGE OF YOUNG AIDS PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Ryan White Story" (tonight, Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42 at 9 p.m.) is the 
tale of the courageous 13-year-old Indiana hemophiliac and AIDS patient (Lukas 
Haas) who had to go to court to be allowed to go to school. Many of his 
neighbors, disbelieving the evidence that AIDS can't be spread through casual 
contact, were afraid of young Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Like many a TV movie, this one focuses almost exclusively on the hero's 
perspective. The officials and neighbors who opposed White's return to school 
are depicted as largely anonymous yahoos and airheads. 
</P>
<P>
While this would probably be an accurate description of many of them, the lack 
of a halfway articulate defense of their viewpoint undermines the drama. For 
example, we don't even see the scene in which the school officials informed 
Ryan's mother that he wouldn't be welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, writers Phil Penningroth and John Herzfeld concentrated on Ryan's 
personal ordeal -- and those of his mother (Judith Light) and sister (Nikki 
Cox). On top of the devastating diagnosis of AIDS, the family had to face 
hostile neighbors and nosy reporters, night and day. They lost several rounds 
in court before they won. Mother and son took turns bolstering each other's 
strength. (Ryan's father doesn't make an appearance in the film.) 
</P>
<P>
The performances of Haas, Light and Cox are carefully measured, even 
understated, but genuinely affecting in the end. George C. Scott gets in a few 
licks as the Whites' attorney, and the cast also includes sensitive 
contributions from George Dzundza, Sarah Jessica Parker, Grace Zabriskie and -- 
in the role of a fellow AIDS patient -- the real Ryan White. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the real Ryan looks so much more ravaged than Haas that one 
suspects the film makers somewhat sanitized the grim medical details. Director 
Herzfeld also goosed the opening and closing of the film with a visual style 
that's almost hyped-up enough for MTV. But the razzmatazz doesn't damage the 
heart of the film. DON SHIRLEY

'COVER GIRL AND THE COP': WHAT 2 WOMEN CAN DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Cover Girl and the Cop" (at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39) is not the 
worst TV movie ever made. It could, however, be used as an argument to make bad 
television a punishable offense. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Duffy is forced to take her vain, ditzy blond "Newhart" character a step 
too far. She plays Jackie, a Vanna White-type TV celebrity, pursued by killers 
because she can identify the murderer of a White House VIP. 
</P>
<P>
Who better to protect her, and show her how to be a real woman, than tough 
rookie cop Denise (Dinah Manoff of "Empty Nest"), who has a basketball net in 
her apartment, calls men "scrods" and says "you're dead meat"? 
</P>
<P>
(We can tell Denise is feminine underneath, though -- she runs over curbs when 
she drives.) 
</P>
<P>
Will Denise teach Jackie the beauty benefits of dog shampoo? When she says "act 
like a real woman," will it give Jackie the confidence to dress as a man and 
intimidate a bar full of thugs? Will Jackie persuade Denise to use her womanly 
gifts and put on a skin-tight dress and high heels, enter a swank hotel, gather 
important evidence and nail herself a wealthy boyfriend (without being mistaken 
for a hooker)? 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and Manoff are appealing, but can the plot get any dumber or more 
insulting? Well, yes. You can expect lots of labored humor, chase scenes, 
irrational behavior on all sides and a messy denouement in a church -- so silly 
it's almost worth watching the show for. LYNNE HEFFLEY

BIG BIRD, BARKLEY THE DOG VISIT JAPAN AND GET LOST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Big Bird and his friend, Barkley the Dog, are separated from their tour bus in 
Tokyo -- and they don't speak Japanese. How will they get back to Sesame Street 
? 
</P>
<P>
"Big Bird in Japan" (tonight, Channels 28 and 15 at 8 p.m.) answers this 
question in a way that introduces children to Japanese culture without being 
didactic about it. It also indulges in a bit of delicate, fairy-tale-style 
fantasy that should engage children's imaginations without too much strain. 
</P>
<P>
A co-production of the Children's Television Workshop and the Japanese network 
Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), this "Big Bird" was shot on several beautiful 
Japanese locations by director-writer Jon Stone. It features Maiko Kawakami as 
a mysterious woman who comes to the aid of the stranded Big Bird and Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is Kawakami's barely passable singing voice. Her solos might 
make a few youngsters restless. But the simple musical score -- by Dick Lieb, 
Tony Geiss and Carol Hall -- generally enhances the storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
The picture of Japan here is strictly tourist board-approved, so much so that 
children might confront their parents with a sudden demand for foreign travel. 
</P>
<P>
So take them to Little Tokyo. DON SHIRLEY

ISRAEL TURNS TO RUBBER-COATED 'MARBLE' BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's army has introduced a new bullet designed to reduce fatalities among 
rebellious Arabs fighting Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip, but like other such innovations, the bullet is proving to be as deadly 
as regular ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet, actually a cluster of them launched from a rifle-borne canister, is 
round, slightly larger than a gum ball and made of metal surrounded by a thin, 
black rubber membrane. It shows up on X-rays as a white disc; Palestinians call 
it "the marble." 
</P>
<P>
During the past five days, the bullets have killed two young Palestinians, Arab 
physicians reported. Another boy, age 17, lay unconscious at Mokassed Hospital 
in Jerusalem on Sunday with one of the heavy bullets imbedded in his brain as 
doctors tried to figure out how to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bullet Drifts Deeper 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to get it out. We operated once, but the bullet drifted deeper 
in the brain as we worked," said Dr. Walid Elian, a physician at Mokassed. "We 
are waiting to see if there is a way to keep it in one place. Perhaps with a 
magnet." 
</P>
<P>
Aware that use of the bullet has resulted in deaths, army spokesman Raanan 
Gissin defended its use. "We are conducting tests all the time to find out how 
to reduce fatalities," Gissin said. "We think when this ammunition is used 
properly, it will reduce deaths. This bullet is just supposed to knock out the 
target." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the bullet is the latest Israeli effort to find, through 
technical means, a way to forcefully subdue the Palestinians while not crossing 
some undefined threshold of brutality. Israel's image has suffered both at home 
and abroad during the 13-month Arab uprising as casualties in the occupied 
territories have mounted. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the intifada, as the uprising is known in Arabic, about 340 
Palestinians have been killed by soldiers. Since the first of the year, 10 have 
been shot to death. The new rubber-coated bullet is supplementing the use of 
regular steel-jacketed lead bullets and so-called plastic bullets, which are 
really made of a plastic-and-metal blend. 
</P>
<P>
The new bullet is an "improved" version of a rubber bullet that Israeli troops 
have been using, Gissin said. The old rubber projectile was really more like a 
small baton that, when fired from the end of a rifle, tumbled in space until it 
reached, injured and knocked down the target. It had a range of about 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The range of the rubber-coated, metal bullet is greater, Gissin said, although 
he declined to be specific. "These bullets do not go far, but they spread out 
over a wider area," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet was first used in late November, according to the best available 
information, but it is not clear how widespread its use is. Such information is 
considered classified by the army. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victims Mostly Young 
</P>
<P>
The victims of the bullet so far appear to be mainly young people. 
</P>
<P>
One, an 11-year-old boy from the West Bank town of Tulkarm, died Thursday after 
one of the new bullets pierced his chest, doctors at Mokassed hospital said. On 
Saturday, a 15-year-old girl from Nablus died when the rubber-coated bullet 
pierced her skull. The Jerusalem Post reported that the girl was shot when she 
joined several women in trying to stop soldiers from beating an Arab youth. 
</P>
<P>
Marwan Mugari, the unconscious teen-ager currently under care in Mokassed, was 
shot last Wednesday in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, doctors 
said. Mugari was wounded when he poked his head out the door during a curfew, 
according to an account given by his cousin, Mohammed Mugari. 
</P>
<P>
"The marble is still in his head," Mohammed said in halting English. "Every 
time he moves, it does more damage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fits and Starts 
</P>
<P>
Israel's attempts to find an intimidating yet less deadly way to put down the 
uprising have suffered fits and starts throughout the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
At one point early last year, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin condoned beatings 
of rebellious Arabs and then, under pressure, retracted the policy. Rules for 
firing on protesters and rioters, at first restricted to occasions when a 
soldier's life was in danger, were relaxed late last summer with the 
introduction of plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic bullets were billed as having a shorter range and being less lethal 
than regular rounds. But fatalities continued. The toll of 31 dead in December 
was the second highest registered during the uprising; many of the December 
deaths resulted from plastic bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Another patient in Mokassed, Issa Manasra, 17, will die soon from a plastic 
bullet wound to the heart, doctors said. He lost large amounts of blood after 
he was shot at the Bani Naim refugee camp. His brain died even though his heart 
beats stubbornly on, the physicians explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Factors in Fatalities 
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Gissin attributed such fatalities to three factors. First, he 
said, the Palestinians have stepped up the pace of violent protest. Secondly, 
"friction," which he described as a kind of panic that causes a soldier to fire 
wildly or at close range, sometimes ends in Arab deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "improper use" in a willful manner, perhaps by firing very close to a 
victim, undercuts the official policy of reducing fatalities, Gissin said. 
"Only in the third case can we do anything to control the problems," he added, 
pointing out that soldiers found to have misused their weapons on purpose can 
be court-martialed. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli politicians, especially those on the left, have been critical of the 
continuing casualties, especially after the introduction of supposedly 
less-lethal plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has rejected the use of riot control equipment and 
relatively non-lethal ammunition, like birdshot, because it considers the 
conflict in the occupied territories to be an extension of Arab wars against 
Israel, which thus must be handled by military means.

HUD PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
KEMP SPURS HIGH HOPES ON RIGHT, LEFT

<P>
It was "Black Monday" -- Oct. 19, 1987. The Dow Jones Average had just fallen 
more than 500 points and a group of young stockbrokers had gathered in a 
Manhattan nightclub to listen to a speech by Jack Kemp, who was then a 
Republican presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned by the events of the day, some people in the audience expected a stern 
lecture about Wall Street run amok and about the need for new brakes on the 
economy. They did not know Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
The only cure for an ailing free enterprise system is more freedom, Kemp 
argued. Fiercely ebullient, he talked about a "Kemp bull market" fueled by 
reduced taxes, lower interest rates and less government interference that would 
spread prosperity from Wall Street to the South Bronx and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to unleash the power of entrepreneurial capitalism not only in New York 
City but in Liberty City, Miami, in East St. Louis and in Watts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it appears that Kemp will have a chance to test his vision of capitalism 
for the urban poor and do it amid the sort of crisis atmosphere that the former 
professional football quarterback says he relishes. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush has nominated him to be secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, a position that could quickly make Kemp one of the most watched 
officials in the new Administration. Awaiting him will be the decade's harvest 
of shame, the million or more homeless people who are HUD's most conspicuous 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has promised a "kinder, gentler America," and the sincerity of that 
promise will be gauged in large part by what HUD and other domestic agencies do 
in the inner cities to ease the pain of homelessness, joblessness, drug 
addiction, gang violence and economic stagnation during a period of acute 
fiscal austerity. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Kemp, until this year a congressman for 18 years from Upstate 
New York, is raising expectations on both the right and the left. Conservatives 
remember him as one of the architects of Reaganomics and see him as one of 
their closest kinsmen in the Bush Administration. Many congressional liberals 
recall Kemp as a friendly adversary who was committed in his own way to making 
a better life for the urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cranston Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
California Sen. Alan Cranston is one of the optimistic Democrats. He is 
sponsoring a bill that calls for an expensive new federal housing program that 
could quickly put him at odds with Kemp. But aides say Cranston isn't worried 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cranston) feels good about the nomination. He feels Kemp is someone we can 
work with," said Don Campbell, a housing specialist on Cranston's staff. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the people who like Kemp have less affection for his ideas. Kemp 
has long championed the view that the poor need fewer handouts and more 
incentives to own their homes and start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no serious opposition to his nomination, but there is plenty 
of apprehension in the air as people wait to see how Kemp responds to the most 
urgent question awaiting the next HUD secretary: What can be done about the 
growing shortage of low-income housing? 
</P>
<P>
The crunch began in 1983 when the number of poverty-level families in the 
nation began to overtax the supply of affordable housing, according to an 
analysis by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's voting record reflects a longstanding opposition to increased federal 
spending for new housing. However, people close to him caution against 
prejudging him from his votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some votes were cast on HUD and on housing issues out of loyalty to the Reagan 
Administration. I think now there are areas where you might expect a different 
approach," said Mary Brunette, Kemp's press secretary. Kemp is not granting 
interviews while his appointment is pending. 
</P>
<P>
A nationally known real estate developer, James W. Rouse, a strong advocate of 
housing construction, met with Kemp this week at Cranston's behest and came 
away optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between Kemp and some other conservatives is that he 
acknowledges that the shortage of low-income housing is a terrible problem," 
Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
If his nomination is approved by Congress, Kemp will take over an agency whose 
declining budget and prestige have made it a ghost of its former self. Under 
the Reagan Administration, HUD funding for low-cost housing was cut by nearly 
80%. At the same time, HUD's principal programs of economic assistance to 
cities were either eliminated or severely curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the next HUD secretary expect the level of political support in 
Congress that heads of agencies enjoyed during the 1970s. As a result of 
population shifts, members of Congress from cities are now outnumbered more 
than 3 to 1 by suburban representatives. In 1970, urban legislators were in a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp would be assuming an office that has lost much of its sway over domestic 
policy. The man whom Kemp would succeed, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., was nicknamed 
Silent Sam and cast such a small shadow across official Washington that 
President Reagan, who appointed Pierce to the Cabinet job, once mistook him for 
a mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Visible 
</P>
<P>
The voluble Kemp would surely cut a different figure. Friends and foes say that 
Kemp's energy, combined with his influence in the White House and Congress, 
will ignite national debate on the problems of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Kemp will generate debate. Once the debate starts, we'll win," said Maria 
Foscarinis, Washington counsel for the National Coalition for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William H. Gray III of Philadelphia, a leading House Democrat and vice 
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, speaks fondly of Kemp's evangelical 
zeal and predicts that Kemp will turn HUD into a bully pulpit for cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tease Jack, 'What you really wanted to be in life was a black 
preacher,' " Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what he will be able to accomplish with the limited resources at 
his disposal, but he will raise the issues. The world will come to know who 
Jack Kemp is. His boss in the White House will know who he is. That alone will 
be a welcome difference." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's ties to black and Latino Democrats in Congress distinguish him from many 
other conservatives and help explain the enthusiasm some liberals in Washington 
have expressed about his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
On this subject, Kemp is not shy about blowing his own horn. 
</P>
<P>
"I take a back seat to no one in my ability to reach out to the blue-collar 
worker, to Hispanics, to blacks and folks at the grass-roots level," he said on 
the campaign trail last year. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat who represents the South Bronx, one of New 
York's most destitute neighborhoods, still speaks with amazement at the 
friendship that developed between him and Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
"We were having a memorial for Munoz Marin (the late Luis Munoz Marin, former 
governor of Puerto Rico) when all of a sudden this fellow Kemp gets up to 
speak. I was dumbfounded. Here was a complete right-winger, getting up and 
speaking with such knowledge and such praise about Munoz and about Puerto 
Rico," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"I quickly learned he was someone who was not afraid of blacks or Hispanics. We 
became fast friends and we started working on things. . . . They called us the 
odd couple." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Projects 
</P>
<P>
Together, Kemp and Garcia sponsored a bill to create urban enterprise zones. 
The legislation was never fully enacted. It remains the subject of intense 
debate, and it lies at the heart of Kemp's congressional agenda for rebuilding 
inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zones take their cue from prosperous Third World cities, notably 
Hong Kong, where rapid economic growth has been attributed, in part, to an 
absence of taxes, government red tape and regulation. The Kemp-Garcia bill 
sought to foster a similar business climate in depressed areas of American 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the bill but withheld the federal tax credits that the authors 
proposed. Meanwhile, several cities around the country have been able to set up 
enterprise zones free from some local levies and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives, including officials of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, 
where Kemp is working for the time being, predict that enterprise zones will 
take root across the country once Congress agrees to the tax incentives that 
were originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Action Urged 
</P>
<P>
But others argue that the federal government must do more. A study by the Urban 
Institute, a Washington foundation, of several successful enterprise zones 
concluded that tax abatements and deregulation were only the first steps. 
</P>
<P>
"Far from creating an environment of no government and unfettered free 
enterprise," the study said, successful zones have required hefty expenditures 
from local governments for assembling land, upgrading utilities, improving 
police and fire protection, providing technical assistance to businesses and 
training for disadvantaged employees. 
</P>
<P>
However, the debate over enterprise zones pales compared to the fight over 
housing policy that the next HUD secretary will have to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Reagan Administration, which all but shut down federally 
subsidized housing construction, contend that in the past HUD building 
subsidies had amounted to a pork barrel for contractors and federal 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
A new book by the Heritage Foundation urges HUD to stick to its current system 
of rent subsidies. Subsidy certificates, called vouchers, are distributed to 
lowincome renters who are then left to find available housing. The Heritage 
Foundation argues that under the voucher system more poor Americans are 
receiving housing assistance than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blamed for Homelessness 
</P>
<P>
Congressional liberals, on the other hand, blame the ballooning homeless 
population on the decision to stop subsidizing new housing. As the housing 
shortage worsens, the voucher system becomes more of a cruel hoax, its critics 
say. "It's like giving hungry people food stamps to shop in an empty store," 
said Derek Shearer, a professor of public policy at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
A housing task force funded by Congress and chaired by James Rouse recently 
recommended a $3-billion construction program for low-income housing. The 
National Coalition for the Homeless and other groups are pushing for a 
$15-billion effort. 
</P>
<P>
But over the various wish lists looms the federal deficit, an inky cloud that 
could envelop the most visionary HUD agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not matter who runs HUD, be it a Scrooge or a spendthrift," said a 
senior staff member on one congressional budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tribute to Kemp 
</P>
<P>
In such a difficult time, it is a tribute to Kemp that both conservatives and 
liberals have high hopes for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Kemp's nomination is a master stroke. It shows you can have a kinder, gentler 
nation with tough, conservative policy," said Stuart M. Butler, one of the 
contributors to the Heritage Foundation's recent book dealing with HUD. 
</P>
<P>
However, Democrat Stanley Treitel, director of a Los Angeles nonprofit 
corporation that builds low-income housing, believes that Kemp ultimately will 
side with those who say the federal government must build more housing. 
</P>
<P>
Treitel knows Kemp and admired him enough to contribute to his presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic about him because I know what kind of person he is," Treitel 
said. "Once he starts traveling around the country and sees that he is dealing 
with people, with human lives, he will respond. It may mean he has to change 
his philosophy somewhat, but I think he is capable of that."

ANTI-SANDINISTA MARCH HELD BY BROAD COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After six months of government-imposed quiescence, Nicaragua's civic opposition 
returned to the streets Sunday with a spirited but peaceful march by 4,500 
people representing the broadest coalition of anti-Sandinista forces ever 
gathered. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was less than half of what opposition leaders had hoped for. But 
they said that the march, which drew Communist factory workers, right-wing 
businessmen and activists of 13 political parties, was the first step toward 
building a united opposition bloc for next year's general elections. 
</P>
<P>
Behind a multicolored row of party flags, the marchers filed 17 blocks through 
the hot narrow streets of two working-class neighborhoods. Banners and shouted 
slogans announced long-held grievances against the revolutionary government: 
militarism, political prisoners, hyper-inflation, wage restrictions and 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbolic Coffin Burned 
</P>
<P>
As the march ended just outside the city's cemetery, several youths burned a 
black box symbolizing a Sandinista coffin, then spit on it. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, opposition parties have pressed a common agenda of 
constitutional reforms that would ease the Sandinistas' grip on political 
power. But Sunday was the first time they had joined together, not only among 
themselves but also with the anti-Sandinista business chamber and all four 
dissident union federations, to measure their combined forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a historic day for Nicaragua," Miriam Arguello, president of a 
Conservative Party faction, told the marchers from the back of a pickup truck. 
"This is a starting point for the unity that has lain dormant so long because 
many of us were afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Arguello was among 38 Nicaraguans jailed after a protest rally July 10 in 
Nandaime, a town south of Managua, turned violent. A sharp crackdown on that 
rally, after the collapse of peace talks with U.S.-backed Contras, ended 10 
months of relative freedom for anti-Sandinista groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions Eased 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for new peace talks after President-elect Bush takes office, the 
Sandinistas have eased political restrictions in recent weeks. They freed the 
last of the Nandaime prisoners in December and gave opposition leaders the 
required permit to march Sunday. The police kept their distance and did not 
wear riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
However, the government did move to keep people away from the march. As soon as 
the march time was set, the Sports Ministry arranged a baseball game in Managua 
between national all-star teams for the same hour. Thousands of tickets were 
given away and the game was televised live. 
</P>
<P>
Both pro-government newspapers reported in recent days that the U.S. Embassy 
had given $25,000 to six conservative opposition leaders to pay their followers 
in the march. The embassy and the politicians denied the story, and leftist 
participants in the march dismissed it as an attempt by the government to sow 
dissension among its foes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March Called 'Total Failure' 
</P>
<P>
The official Voice of Nicaragua radio called the march "a total failure," and 
opposition leaders admitted disappointment with the turnout. They said 
Sandinista authorities denied permits that would have allowed private bus 
owners to transport marchers here from several provincial cities. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion of the march was the 11th anniversary last Tuesday of the slaying 
of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a newspaper publisher and prominent foe of the 
Somoza family dictatorship. His assassination helped push Nicaragua toward 
revolution, and President Anastasio Somoza was toppled 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
A march on the 10th anniversary of Chamorro's death -- held in an atmosphere of 
somewhat greater political freedom -- drew about 10,000 people. It was 
sponsored by the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinator, a conservative coalition 
representing about half the forces assembled Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's Widow Active 
</P>
<P>
One leader who worked to broaden the demonstration was Violeta Barrios, 
Chamorro's widow and successor as publisher of La Prensa. After serving in the 
first post-Somoza junta, she turned against the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"Pedro always believed that opposition unity was indispensable for getting rid 
of the Somoza tyranny," she told the crowd Sunday. "We are in the same 
situation today." 
</P>
<P>
Father Bismarck Carballo struck the same theme in his homily at a memorial Mass 
before the start of the march, as did several speakers along the route. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the moment to ask the Virgin Mary and Jesus to help us work together," 
he said. "In unity there is strength." 
</P>
<P>
Eli Altamirano, the Communist Party's leader, called for "a government of 
national salvation" made up of opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Common Cause' Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think this is ridiculous because of the contradictions among us," 
he said. "They forget the common cause of those who are tired of military 
dictatorship, war, ruin and misery." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, visiting U.S. congressmen and European political leaders have 
urged anti-Sandinista groups to work together. Opposition leaders said they met 
for several weeks before overcoming differences about who would march where and 
who would deliver the six main speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some agitated clashes over ambitions and egos," said Mauricio Diaz, 
head of the Popular Social Christian Party. "Some of us have not spoken to each 
other in years. We are starting to mature as an opposition, but it will still 
be a while before we can turn into an electoral front." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Single Slate 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that the task will be difficult, several other politicians said 
they are convinced of the need to field a single opposition slate in the 
November, 1990, election, when it is presumed that President Daniel Ortega will 
seek reelection as the Sandinista candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega won election in 1984 over six opposition candidates. The Democratic 
Coordinator, the most powerful opposition group, boycotted that election, 
charging that the rules favored the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has to look for ways to keep mobilizing people against the 
Sandinistas, then we can worry about who will be the candidate," said Erick 
Ramirez, a Social Christian Party leader with presidential ambitions.

NO AFGHAN PULLOUT DELAY, SOVIETS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
REMAINING 55,000 TROOPS TO BE GONE BY FEB. 15 DEADLINE, GENERAL REAFFIRMS

<P>
In a move to put an end to speculation about Soviet intentions, the Soviet 
military commander in Afghanistan said Sunday that he expects all of the 
Kremlin's troops to be withdrawn from that country by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a delicate question which worries everybody in the world and, of course, 
it worries us," Lt. Gen. Boris V. Gromov said. "But the plan and the scheme of 
the withdrawal have been drawn up." 
</P>
<P>
Gromov told Soviet television that the withdrawal of the remaining 55,000 
Soviet troops in Afghanistan would be completed by Feb. 15, the date specified 
in an accord reached in Geneva last April. The agreement was signed by 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and the United States, the latter two 
as guarantors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Was Silent 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Soviets announced that they were suspending their troop 
withdrawal because of the worsening military situation in Afghanistan, and they 
blamed increased rebel attacks and U.S. arms shipments to the insurgents. Since 
then, the Kremlin had refused to confirm the withdrawal date, and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev omitted any mention of the February commitment 
during his speech to the United Nations in December. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the deadline mounted after the breakdown of peace talks between 
Soviet officials and Afghan resistance groups based in Pakistan. The rebels 
said they would not meet again with the Soviets if the latter continued to 
insist on a role for the current Soviet-backed regime in Kabul in any future 
Afghan government. 
</P>
<P>
After the talks broke down, Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Kremlin's trouble-shooter on 
Afghan matters, said there was a danger that the Soviet Union would not be able 
to meet its obligations under the Geneva accord. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Moscow last Tuesday after a tour of Afghanistan and the region, 
Vorontsov warned that the Feb. 15 pullout deadline was in jeopardy because of 
continued rebel attacks on Afghan government forces and the unresolved issue of 
a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who paid an unexpected visit to 
Kabul over the weekend, ended his trip by issuing a statement pledging to the 
Kabul government that the Soviets will "not leave it in need." 
</P>
<P>
A Tass news agency report on Shevardnadze's visit noted that Afghan rebel 
groups are planning an economic blockade of the capital and that "a shortage of 
food and fuel is felt in Kabul already now, and the situation is being 
aggravated by winter cold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Interference Allowed 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Afghan press agency, Shevardnadze was quoted 
as saying that the Soviets will not permit the rebels to interfere with 
Moscow's obligations to supply the Kabul government "despite all obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
"If a war is imposed on the Afghan government despite the common sense and 
logic of national interests, (the Soviet Union) will be forced to counter this 
with a force of arms, and it has this force," Shevardnadze told the official 
Bakhtar news agency. "The present regime has every opportunity to withstand, 
and in case the war goes on, the Soviet arms supplies will also be continued." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze appeared to be lashing out at the United States and Pakistan, 
which have supported the rebels, when he complained in the interview that the 
people "who harangue most of all for the withdrawal of Soviet troops" now 
appear to be trying to prevent the pullback in order to justify their 
assistance to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze and the Afghan government of President Najibullah expressed hope 
that the rebels would agree to terms for a peace settlement that would allow 
the participation of all the parties to the conflict in a future government. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said that 
talks between the Soviet Union and the moujahedeen rebels are a positive 
development and should be continued. 
</P>
<P>
"It is proper for the leaders of the Soviet Union to show their good faith and 
accept the will of the Afghan nation in choosing their real representatives," 
Velayati told a conference of rebel leaders in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have so far withdrawn about 50,000 troops from Afghanistan and are 
expected to pull out the remaining 55,000 between now and the deadline. Western 
diplomats in Kabul have reported a sharp increase in the number of military 
transports leaving the capital at night, as well as the closure of the Soviet 
military hospital in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union invaded the country in 1979 and had as many as 115,000 troops 
there at the height of its involvement. The lengthy conflict was a huge drain 
on Soviet economic resources, however, and mounting casualties provoked growing 
opposition at home.

An ex-Israeli intelligence officer blamed a Palestinian faction for blowing up 
a Pan Am passenger jet over the Scottish village of Lockerbie last month and 
killing 270 people. Raphael Eitan, a former high-ranking officer in the Mossad, 
Israel's intelligence agency, told Scotland's Sunday Post that those 
responsible "belong to a little-known Palestinian faction calling themselves 
May 15. The man responsible is Abu Ibrahim." A British Foreign Office spokesman 
gave little credence to the report. Meanwhile, The Sunday Express newspaper in 
London said a member of the U.S. armed forces may have been duped into taking a 
bomb on board. The story followed reports that U.S. troops in West Germany had 
been offered money to take packages of diamonds to New York.

A Venezuelan congressional report found that 14 fishermen killed in a 
military-led ambush in October were shot from behind, casting doubt on the 
military's claim they died during a gun battle with Colombian guerrillas. The 
report, portions of which were printed in Caracas newspapers, said the 14 were 
shot in the back and the back of the head, many at close range, "which makes it 
presumable the deaths . . . (were) not the product of a confrontation." The 
military originally reported the incident as a gun battle with guerrillas, but 
two survivors later testified that it was a massacre of civilians.

A fire in a three-story rooming house in Yonkers, N.Y., killed seven people and 
injured at least eight others, including five firefighters, authorities said. A 
woman was in guarded condition at St. Joseph's Hospital, a nursing supervisor 
said. Two badly burned bodies were found just behind the front door, Fire 
Commissioner William McLaughlin said, adding that the door opened outward and 
officials were uncertain why the two could not escape. Investigators were 
seeking the cause of the blaze.

A federal judge handling the case of alleged Oakland drug kingpin Rudolph 
Henderson refused to remove herself from the case despite the defendants' 
allegations that she is biased. Henderson and eight other defendants accused 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel of being too close to prosecutor George 
Niespolo and of confiding to a nurse that she planned to "put Henderson away." 
The allegations were filed in a motion for Patel to remove herself from the 
case. Patel denied the charges as "scurrilous" and "lacking in truth" and asked 
that another federal judge review and resolve them. Henderson and the others 
are scheduled to stand trial next month on drug and racketeering charges. They 
were arrested in 1987 after more than two years of wiretap surveillance.

As more Nicaraguan refugees pour into Miami from Texas, a pregnant woman housed 
at the Bobby Maduro Stadium was said by hospital officials to be suffering from 
chicken pox, prompting fear she may have unknowingly spread the disease among 
others. Celia Gutierrez, a Nicaraguan refugee in her ninth month of pregnancy, 
was allowed into the stadium -- which already holds 263 refugees -- because of 
her advanced pregnancy, authorities said. The migration of Nicaraguans from 
Texas was sparked when a federal judge ruled Jan. 12 that the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service could not require the refugees to stay in Brownsville 
while their applications for political asylum were being processed there. Since 
the ruling, about 700 Nicaraguan refugees have arrived in Miami by bus.

BRAZIL TO CUT 60,000 JOBS

The Brazilian government imposed a wage-and-price freeze, revamped the currency 
and announced it will lay off as many as 60,000 public employees as part of a 
sweeping program to control soaring inflation and trim a huge budget deficit. 
Union leaders threatened to call a nationwide strike to protest the measures, 
which eliminated an automatic monthly indexing of wages to inflation. 
"Inflation should fall drastically and abruptly," Finance Minister Mailson 
Nobrega said. Today and Tuesday were declared bank holidays to allow time for 
the financial system to adapt to the new measures, which included a 17% 
devaluation of the cruzado.

Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, the Reagan Administration's closest ally 
in the Caribbean, announced a parliamentary election for Feb. 9. Seaga, 58, who 
is seeking an unprecedented third consecutive four-year term, criticized his 
main rival, Socialist opposition leader Michael Manley. Seaga, at a Kingston 
rally, berated Manley's record and took credit for restoring political 
stability, economic recovery and international relations. Critics, however, say 
Seaga's economic restructuring and austerity measures have neglected social 
services and that his popularity has continued to fade. It will be Jamaica's 
first contested general election since 1980.

East German police detained 80 protesters in Leipzig after several hundred 
people tried to march through the city to demand freedom of expression and 
assembly, Protestant church sources said. Demonstrators who reportedly had 
gathered outside the city's Old Town Hall for the march ignored calls to 
disperse, and police moved in, detaining 80. Witnesses reported use of force by 
police but gave no details. The marchers apparently had planned to call for the 
release of 11 human rights and peace activists. Leaflets announcing the 
demonstration, and calling for freedom of assembly and expression and a free 
press, were found last week in Leipzig, East Germany's second-largest city.

PRISON SEEKS TO TERMINATE PACT ON DEATH ROW TREATMENT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Quentin prison is trying to end a 1980 agreement spelling out standards for 
treatment and housing of Death Row inmates, contending it can no longer comply 
because of constantly increasing numbers of condemned prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In a document filed in federal court here, Deputy Atty. Gen. John Donhoff, 
acting on behalf of the prison, called for an end to the agreement. His action 
was in response to a request by lawyers for the inmates that the state be held 
in contempt for violating terms of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"They fired the first shot," Donhoff said, calling the nine-year-old agreement 
"outdated" and "at worst a dangerous and extravagant interference with 
professional prison management." 
</P>
<P>
The contempt hearing will begin Tuesday in federal court and include testimony 
from prison officials and inmates. Donhoff said that the cost of complying with 
all terms of the agreement would be in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no intent on the part of anyone at San Quentin to violate anyone's 
constitutional rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also maintained that San Quentin meets constitutional requirements for 
housing Death Row inmates and that since 1980, court rulings have made it clear 
that by complying with the agreement, the prison would be exceeding what is 
required by the law. The first inmates arrived on Death Row in 1978, after 
reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prison's Position Explained 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we cannot be burdened with spending a dime unless it is 
constitutionally required," Donhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general entered into the consent decree in 1980 to settle a 
suit brought the year before by the Prison Law Office, a prisoner rights law 
firm, on behalf of all Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, there were 40 condemned inmates, all of whom were housed on Death 
Row. Now, however, California's Death Row has grown to become the third largest 
in the nation, with more than 225 condemned prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The original 68-cell Death Row was shut down last year because the building 
that housed it is being renovated. The $40-million rebuilding was undertaken in 
part because of other suits over conditions at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal is still fully doable and they should be held to their bargain," said 
Jeffrey D. Wohl, a private San Francisco attorney who is helping to argue the 
inmates' case. 
</P>
<P>
Wohl said the prison and other officials want out of the agreement "for 
political reasons." He said they are concerned that they "would get into 
trouble with the public" if people thought condemned inmates were "being given 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
The suit is before U.S. District Judge Stanley A. Weigel, who appointed Robert 
Riggs, an attorney, to act as special master to monitor Death Row and preside 
over the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs is expected to ask the prison to justify why inmates in their new 
cellblock are given less access to law books, cannot leave their cells to spend 
time on the tier, and are allowed fewer showers. Noise also is above acceptable 
standards, according to a report filed by Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Riggs will be asking for explanations about why the prison has 
not provided a cover for the exercise yard or equipment such as weights, and 
why it does not allow condemned inmates to buy some items. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All They've Got' 
</P>
<P>
"To someone not in prison, this may not seem like too big a deal," Wohl said. 
"But to someone in prison, it is a very big deal because that's all they've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
The state contends that if it provides much of what is written into the consent 
decree there would be security problems. 
</P>
<P>
Death Row inmates may not have oil paints because the paint is flammable. 
Prison officials say dental floss and tooth powder in combination can be used 
as a saw, and weights have been used as weapons. And in the new cellblock, 
there isn't enough space for inmates to be allowed to walk on the tiers, so 
they must spend more time in their cells, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the consent agreements entered into in one era by one 
administration can become outdated," Donhoff said. "These were promises made 
back when there were fewer than 40 inmates." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sallyanne Campbell of the Prison Law Office said the agreement 
provides a relatively quick method for investigating allegations of improper 
treatment and housing. Without the consent decree in place, inmates would file 
more lawsuits to enforce minimum standards of treatment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people enter into consent decrees is so they don't have to 
litigate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Death Rows in other states are monitored by courts in a similar manner, but no 
court in California or elsewhere in recent years has thrown out a consent 
decree in a Death Row suit.

HIGH COURT ASKED TO DEFER TO VOTERS' STAND ON PROP. 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeal to state Supreme Court justices to show "deference" to the judgment 
of the voters who approved Proposition 103, by upholding the measure's 
constitutionality, has been made by lawyers for six South Los Angeles drivers 
who lost an important auto insurance class-action case before the high court 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In that suit, Public Advocates Inc. asked the court for an order requiring the 
Legislature, which had made auto insurance mandatory, to act so that coverage 
would be more available and affordable. The court's refusal to issue such an 
order is credited by some with fueling the reform drive that led to five 
insurance initiatives on the 1988 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter last week to each of the seven Supreme Court justices, lawyers 
Armando M. Menocal III and Lois Salisbury of Public Advocates quoted from 
suggestions that the Supreme Court had made in dismissing the class-action suit 
and contended that in passing Proposition 103, the electorate had been acting 
in pursuit of those suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, they told the justices, "We ask that the solution crafted and 
enacted by the people, Proposition 103, be respected and deferred to by this 
court." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has stayed the rate rollbacks in Proposition 103, pending its 
constitutional review, but in the meantime has allowed almost all the rest of 
it to tentatively go into effect. The insurance industry lawsuit now before the 
court, however, asks the justices to strike down all of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter, Menocal and Salisbury noted that since enforcement of the 
mandatory auto insurance law began at the end of 1987, the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles says it has suspended 250,000 licenses of drivers caught without 
the required auto liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the class-action suit brought mainly on behalf of minority 
drivers in South and East Los Angeles was that under the territorial rating 
system used by insurance companies, the insurance cost more in low-income, 
central city areas than anywhere else. The suit asked for relief. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, turning this down, said the plaintiffs had not gone to the 
right place for relief. "Their case should be made to the Legislature, not to 
this court," the justices ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Menocal and Salisbury said in their letter that after the decision, "the 
Legislature struggled unsuccessfully for an entire year to solve the problem," 
leading those seeking relief to turn to the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the voters of the State of California took action, passing 
Proposition 103," they said, adding that certain provisions of the measure, 
reducing territorial ratings as a factor in pricing, rolling back rates and 
setting new competitive guidelines for the sale of insurance "will correct many 
of the profound inequities and frustrations" that their class-action suit had 
been aimed at redressing. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury, interviewed Sunday, said: "What's unusual in all of this is the 
quick sequence of events. Within a year of the time the court told us to seek 
redress through legislation, the Legislature foundered and the public did take 
action, legislating on its own." 
</P>
<P>
Had the Supreme Court acted affirmatively on the class-action suit, she 
contended, "the pressure to provide more affordable insurance might have been 
alleviated without an initiative.

VIGIL, PRAYERS MARK KING BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Americans remembered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his 60th birthday 
anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, Coretta Scott 
King, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address Sunday, calling the civil 
rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
At Boston University's School of Theology, where King received a doctorate 
degree in 1955, students and teachers gathered for a Sunday night candlelight 
vigil. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush, returning to Washington on Sunday from a three-day 
Florida fishing vacation, scheduled an address to a prayer breakfast at a 
Washington hotel today -- a federal holiday recognized by every state except 
Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
King was killed by a sniper on April 4, 1968, while standing on a motel balcony 
in Memphis, Tenn. The assassin, James Earl Ray, was imprisoned for life. 
</P>
<P>
In Selma, Ala., three blacks will be sworn in as members of the Dallas County 
Commission today. It was there that King began the historic 1965 
Selma-to-Montgomery march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of Erskine Minor, Perry Varner and D. L. Pope will end 112 
years of white county rule and 10 years of legal battles to keep the commission 
white in a place where 55% of the residents are black. The three new 
commissioners were elected in special balloting last month. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. King, speaking at the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where 
King and his father shared the pulpit, said the ceremony was to honor "a 
courageous young dreamer who picked up the torch of freedom and carried it from 
Montgomery to Memphis with an unshakable faith in the promise of the American 
dream. Martin passed that torch to us to continue the pursuit of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Although the 'white only' signs of the 1950s and 1960s are gone," she 
said, "segregated neighborhoods and schools remain a pervasive fact of American 
life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Play by Boston Students 
</P>
<P>
The city of Boston was hosting a ceremony and a tribute to King, including a 
performance today of a play written by students titled "Dreams." The play's 
title was taken from King's moving 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
An interfaith service was held in the nation's capital at the Washington Hebrew 
Congregation to commemorate King's birthday, and the civil rights leader was 
remembered in religious services throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, the Mormon Church said it is closing its offices today to 
allow church employees to observe the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Boston University was holding religious services to commemorate King's birthday 
and to mark today's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in a sermon Sunday at a church in New York's 
poverty-stricken Harlem section, lashed out at those who set back King's 
efforts by "self-destruction" through drugs and violence. "Dr. King was our 
gift from God. Martin Luther King did not fight and die for your right to use 
cocaine, crack and heroin," said Jackson, who marched for civil rights with 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will be in Atlanta today to deliver a sermon and help lead a parade. 
Tonight in Los Angeles, he will receive the SCLC Martin Luther King Award.

STUDENTS GAIN POLITICAL CLOUT IN SENEGAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DAKAR, Senegal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the pink-splashed walls of the university buildings the slogans survive, 
scrawled in black: "La Lutte Continue," "A Bas le Fascisme." 
</P>
<P>
The struggle goes on. Down with fascism. 
</P>
<P>
"That's from before," said Mamadou Bocoum from his mildewy dormitory room at 
one end of a dank hallway. "Before we ended the strike." 
</P>
<P>
Bocoum is 26 and his eyes were bright with triumph. As a leader of the longest 
student strike in his country's history, he helped establish his colleagues as 
a political force to be reckoned with. No less a figure than Senegal's 
President Abdou Diouf came to their table to personally settle the yearlong 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
By then what had begun as an annual rite of education here had escalated into 
Senegal's worst civil disturbance since independence in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Unique Liberty 
</P>
<P>
Fed by the country's extraordinary liberty of political discourse, unique in 
sub-Saharan Africa, last year's strike became entwined with the nastiest 
presidential election in Senegal's history. Before it was over, the cities were 
under curfew, the army was occupying the university and some political leaders 
were in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting crisis may have done lasting damage to Senegal's reputation for 
open democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons and others, Bocoum may be over-optimistic in relegating those 
graffiti to the past. For if the revolt proved anything, it is that the 
problems of Senegal's youth are sure to persist long enough to inspire another 
strike, possibly even more violent, this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has survived a major political crisis," said one representative 
of an international aid agency. "But it's the lull before the storm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Politicized 
</P>
<P>
Bocoum's classmates are by a wide margin the most politicized in Africa, the 
most expert disrupters on the continent. They learn the art of agitation early, 
for effective strikes by secondary-school students as young as 11 have been a 
fixture each October since Bocoum himself was a secondary-school pupil. 
</P>
<P>
With an elite leadership that is well traveled in Europe and exposed to other 
West African students who come to Senegal to study, the country's students are 
among the continent's most sophisticated and cosmopolitan. That makes for a 
discomfiting contrast with the basic poverty of their surroundings and 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more alert to the social consequences of Senegal's nine-year-old 
economic austerity program than the students, who feel they are doomed to leave 
campus armed with advanced degrees and virtually no job prospects in its 
overwhelmingly rural economy. 
</P>
<P>
Of the University of Dakar's 2,500 baccalaureate graduates in 1982, fully 1,000 
remain unemployed today, said Bocoum. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the country's feeble economy deserves some of the blame, but many 
observers point to a fundamental deficiency in its educational system. 
</P>
<P>
Put simply, Senegal, which is 65% rural, graduates more lawyers and 
philosophers than farmers. This is a relic of the tradition-bound colonial 
French educational system, which Senegal's schools still follow more closely 
than those of any other former French colony in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
With a curriculum resembling American liberal arts studies, the system promotes 
academic learning at the expense of the technical and vocational training that 
Senegal desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of 9,000 Jobs 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the chasm between the students' training and the country's 
requirements has widened over the last few years, in which Senegal has 
undertaken an industrial restructuring resulting in the loss of 9,000 
managerial, government and industrial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The eruption of such a mixture last year marked a watershed in Senegal's 
educational and political history. Where previous strikes had lasted six to 
eight weeks, this one consumed the entire year. In the end the government 
agreed to erase the year from student records and to forgive all housing and 
tuition bills. 
</P>
<P>
This strike marked the emergence of Senegal's students as perhaps the most 
potent political force in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Here the government listens to students," said one diplomatic observer. "They 
fill the gap left by the nonexistence of a political opposition." 
</P>
<P>
That could be explosive. If unemployment is the tinder of student unrest, the 
fire was lit by the spark of politics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike Began Conventionally 
</P>
<P>
Senegal's politicians may have underestimated the 1988 strike because it began 
so conventionally late in 1987 in the secondary schools. There, the pupils' 
protests over degrading classroom conditions and a lack of books and materials 
has become an annual feature of the rentree, the start of the school year, and 
the authorities seemed unconcerned even as it stretched on into February. 
</P>
<P>
That was the danger point, because in February the nation's presidential 
election began with opposition charges that Diouf was prepared to win by fraud, 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign charges caught the imagination of the students, who were being 
actively courted by Diouf's leading opponent, a hulking, baldheaded lawyer 
named Abdoulaye Wade who had lost two previous presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
Wade often capped his campaign appearances by calling Diouf a "traitor." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Wade's platform was not much different from Diouf's -- nor could it 
be in Senegal's stringent economic climate. He pledged to roll back the price 
of rice, a staple food, by more than 50% but gave no hint how he would handle 
the ruinous government deficit that would ensue. 
</P>
<P>
But Wade's strength among the youth was also his fundamental weakness. With 
Senegal's minimum voting age set at 21, the larger part of his most 
enthusiastic supporters were ineligible to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assured of Victory 
</P>
<P>
In any event, most political observers in Senegal believe that Diouf was 
assured of victory. For one thing, existing electoral rules strongly favor the 
incumbent by forbidding any formal coalition-building among the opposition. 
With 16 opposition parties ranging from conservative to Maoist, there was 
little chance that any one could muster sufficient support to unseat Diouf's 
ruling Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, Senegal's all-powerful marabouts, the leaders of its two 
main Islamic sects, had thrown their support behind Diouf. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the government's announcement on Feb. 29, the morning after 
election day, that Diouf had won 73% of the vote seemed indecently hasty. Riots 
broke out in Dakar led by the university students, their ranks swelled by 
thousands of street children who have gathered aimlessly in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Diouf immediately declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew on Dakar. 
Complaining that "during the electoral campaign there was certain manipulation 
of the youths, who were used for political ends," he arrested the most likely 
manipulator, Wade, for "threatening the security of the state." 
</P>
<P>
(Wade was eventually convicted and received a one-year suspended sentence; he 
later lost most of his political credibility by accepting an amnesty from 
Diouf.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Control 
</P>
<P>
When Diouf in mid-March shut down the Dakar campus to restore order, he lost 
control of the situation. The students established a leadership committee of 
which Bocoum was a member, refused to return to classes when the school was 
hastily reopened and issued a 10-point strike manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these were quasi-political demands: The government must "respect the 
franchise of the university" -- that is, keep civil police off the campus; lift 
the state of emergency and curfew, and respect the secondary-school students' 
demands for better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But more were concrete. The strikers demanded that the student bourse, or 
stipend, be paid to a larger percentage of students and raised to about $100 
monthly from $85. The government agreed to raise it to $91. 
</P>
<P>
If these demands were materialistic, the government's response was political. 
Stung by the commercial losses in the cities shut down under curfew, by a 30% 
drop in tourism and by the continuing embarrassment of a student body on the 
march, Diouf committed his government to more than $7 million in education 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows you how much he was negotiating from a position of weakness," said 
one diplomatic critic. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, most Senegalese politicians now acknowledge the importance of the 
youth as a political force, not least because many of those who were too young 
to vote during this presidential election will be enfranchised for the next 
one, in 1993.

BRITAIN PLANS CONTROVERSIAL CRACKDOWN ON VIOLENT SOCCER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police cordon began at the local subway station and wound continuously 
through a half mile of drab, East London side streets on a recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers equipped with hand-held metal detectors pulled young men aside 
for a quick body search while others held firmly to fierce-looking German 
shepherd dogs. Most of the police were helmeted, and even the horses of the 
many mounted officers wore protective plastic visors over their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It might have been a scene from a politically turbulent country in Eastern 
Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East. But actually, it was just a regular 
Saturday afternoon setting for a professional soccer match between cross-town 
rivals in this country, which sees itself as the cradle of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Observer next day reported the crowd at "20,000 -- double that if 
you count the police." That was an exaggeration, but not by much. And it 
underlined the problem of hooliganism, a bitter truth about British soccer, or 
football as the game is known almost everywhere except in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Well over a decade has passed since football violence became a domestic issue 
here, and nearly four years have elapsed since British hooligans made it an 
international scandal by triggering a riot that killed 38 people at Heysel 
Stadium in Brussels. Harsh measures taken since then have helped to contain 
violence, but they have fallen far short of rooting it out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Action 
</P>
<P>
So the government plans its most sweeping action to date this week, when it 
will introduce in Parliament the Football Spectators Bill. The legislation 
would effectively close the country's football stadiums to all but members of 
the respective football clubs -- an unprecedented measure and one that other 
nations in Europe and elsewhere are carefully following. 
</P>
<P>
"The government are determined to break the link between football and 
hooligans," Sports Minister Colin Moynihan said. "We hope all true supporters 
will join us in ridding the game of hooligans." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation has stirred such angry passions, even before being 
introduced, that Peter Jenkins, a political columnist for the Independent 
newspaper and a biographer of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wrote last 
week: "By far the most enjoyable, and possibly the most instructive, issue on 
the political agenda this year is football. It promises to bring out every kind 
of hypocrisy and class prejudice, and present the character of the prime 
minister in an unfortunate light." 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers, possibly reacting more out of wishful thinking than 
hard analysis, suggest that opposition to the measure, even from within the 
ruling Conservative Party, is so great that the government could suffer an 
extraordinary defeat on the football measure. A column in the Times of London 
spoke of "the simmering revolt against Thatcher's pet bill." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would establish a government-controlled Football Membership 
Authority to administer the compulsory, national membership scheme. While many 
details would be left for the authority to work out, the plan envisions a 
computerized, national registry of football fans who would gain admittance to 
the country's 92 professional club stadiums by inserting special cards in 
electronic scanning equipment at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denial of Membership 
</P>
<P>
Fans with a record of football-related offenses would be denied membership for 
up to five years and would thus be barred from games. Also, convicted football 
hooligans would be required to report to some local authority at specific times 
when British clubs were playing elsewhere in Europe -- a feature meant to keep 
them at home and avoid tragedies such as the Brussels riot in 1985 or the 
violent scenes of rampaging fans in West Germany last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is said to have the strong, personal backing of Thatcher, who let it 
be known during a meeting with football league executives last July that if 
they did not come up with a membership scheme voluntarily, her government would 
impose one. 
</P>
<P>
The idea seems to be opposed by nearly everyone else. Owners of the 92 clubs 
affected complain that it will be costly and drive away the casual fan who 
represents an important share of their revenue. Smaller clubs in the lower 
divisions of the professional ranks are particularly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The police say that at best it will just transfer the violence from inside 
stadiums to outside. At worst, said columnist Jenkins, "it may provoke 
turnstile riots as fans pour from the pubs and queue to feed their magnetic 
cards into unreliable electronic scanners." 
</P>
<P>
Some football fans complain that the bill appears to lay on them all the blame 
for a general rise in the level of violence in Britain. And civil libertarians 
are aghast at what they see as a possible first step in a national identity 
card scheme, a notion they describe as symbolic of sinister regimes elsewhere 
and thoroughly un-British. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Class Consciousness 
</P>
<P>
Underlying it all is a class consciousness that still colors a great many 
aspects of British life. 
</P>
<P>
A Sports Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it 
is not correct to blame football violence on any particular group of people. 
"The problem is that football has attracted people whose intention is to cause 
trouble," he said. "No one seems to be immune. It's almost this gladiatorial, 
Saturday afternoon thing." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, however, football is a sport of working-class fans here. Richer sports 
enthusiasts prefer rugby or cricket. 
</P>
<P>
Football fans are overwhelmingly male and young. At a recent cross-town match 
in East London, it seemed to a first-time visitor that he could count the women 
spectators on one hand. There were also few children of either sex. 
</P>
<P>
In the equivalent of the bleachers, the fans stood shoulder to shoulder, 
swaying as they chanted obscene tributes to their own team and heaped scorn on 
the visiting squad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fans Separated 
</P>
<P>
Vast, empty sections of stands were kept clear to separate the home and 
visiting fans, and particularly burly policemen kept a close watch for any sign 
of trouble. If they spotted a troublemaker, there was no argument as they 
grabbed the miscreant under both arms and hustled him roughly out of the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There were 6,147 arrests at Football League matches last season -- a record. No 
one keeps track of the number of people who are simply ejected for making 
trouble, but it is no doubt many times higher than the arrest figure. 
</P>
<P>
In a line for hotdogs and hamburgers outside, two young men were discussing the 
finer techniques of fighting favored by the fans of various clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Ministry official said that attendance at British football matches 
has declined steadily for a generation, from more than 30 million in the late 
1960s to about 19 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, a contributory factor is that the atmosphere and bad language 
that exists at the moment is a deterrent to the man who might take his kids to 
a match," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Boost Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, its supporters argue, the compulsory football membership scheme may 
turn that attendance trend around as more people are attracted to the sport 
when the hooligans have been rooted out. 
</P>
<P>
Club owners object that they are already doing a lot on their own to change the 
image of the sport. Many already have some sort of membership system, although 
only a handful have as much as 50% of their capacity set aside for members. 
</P>
<P>
Millwall, an East London club with a particularly rough reputation, now employs 
a community sports development officer to forge closer links with the 
community. His latest innovation: a plan to give convicted football hooligans a 
second chance by doing community service. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, however, has apparently run out of patience with the sport and seems 
determined to push the membership scheme through. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Jenkins sees a Machiavellian motive in her determination. "Labor (the 
opposition party) is predominantly the party of the working class," he says. 
"To identify football with hooliganism is vicariously to identify Labor with 
violence."

STUDENTS' SIT-IN AT S. AFRICA CONSULATE COULD END TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-apartheid vigil by 27 junior and high school students outside the 
offices of the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills continued for a third 
day Sunday without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police and security guards at the La Cienega Boulevard office 
building where the consulate is located reported no problems, but added that 
only the students' mothers, who brought food, were allowed in to see them. 
</P>
<P>
According to one mother, Phyllis Menard, the students plan to end their protest 
today with a march and rally to oppose South Africa's policy of racial 
separation and discrimination and to commemorate the birthday of slain civil 
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

STARTING PUPPIES ON CAREER PATH AS GUIDE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Orr was setting herself up for another heartbreak as she looked adoringly 
into her Labrador retriever's eyes and stroked the sleek black coat. 
</P>
<P>
Robby is the fifth puppy that Orr has taken into her home to raise until it is 
old enough to be trained as a guide dog. 
</P>
<P>
"They're more than your pet," she said. "They're your shadow, and you feel the 
loss more when you give them up." 
</P>
<P>
However, she keeps getting the pups from International Guiding Eyes in Sylmar, 
where they are bred for their qualities as guide dogs. Orr, from Temple City, 
raises each pup until it is about 15 months old and then returns it to the 
agency for training. 
</P>
<P>
Each dog is eventually teamed with a blind person and, after a month of 
training together, they graduate and begin a partnership that usually lasts a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Brackman, spokeswoman for International Guiding Eyes, said the training 
program usually takes about six months, and each dog learns about 20 commands. 
The blind owners receive the dog and the training free "since few could afford 
the $10,000 it costs for each dog-and-person team," she said. 
</P>
<P>
International Guiding Eyes is financed by gifts and grants, and it graduates 
about 50 teams every year. 
</P>
<P>
"The better I do my job, the less work they have to do," Orr said, referring to 
International Guiding Eyes and explaining her role in making the partnership a 
successful one. 
</P>
<P>
Since she began in January, 1986, with Vicki, her first puppy-in-training, Orr 
has taken her dogs everywhere she can to get them acquainted with the hazards 
that they will face in their life's work. 
</P>
<P>
She exposes them to traffic, airports, plane rides, supermarkets, the dentist's 
office, theaters, children and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns to Scene 
</P>
<P>
When a pup becomes distressed over a noise -- as one did with a clanking 
manhole cover -- Orr returns to the scene until the sound becomes familiar and 
less frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to get a nice dog back from Pat," Brackman said. International 
Guiding Eyes is one of three guide-dog training centers in California and one 
of 10 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We turn a shy, suspicious pup over to her, and we get back a socialized dog 
that is ready for training. That's the most important thing," Brackman said. 
</P>
<P>
Orr is a rarity for the agency, raising five dogs in less than two years, 
Brackman said. Several families in the Los Angeles area have raised three or 
four pups, but none has raised as many as Orr in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki, a golden Labrador retriever, went through her guide dog training with 
unusual speed because of Orr's care, Brackman said. She was teamed in April, 
1987, with Frances Sposeto of Grass Valley, who calls her "the smartest dog in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
"I really lucked out, having Pat Orr as the puppy-raiser," Sposeto said from 
her home in the Sierra foothills, northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Blind for 30 years because of an eye disease, Sposeto said she had never wanted 
a pet, had never even used a white cane, and had been dependent on family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But the feeling of having the dog and going where you want and at the pace you 
want . . . Vicki has gone with me on planes, trains, into Nevada casinos, 
skiing in Colorado," Sposeto said. "You can tell she was raised with love." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated 'Like Gold' 
</P>
<P>
Orr said: "It tore me apart to give Vicki up, but I knew I had accomplished 
something. All you have to do is go to one graduation, and you know you want to 
raise 10,000. Suddenly, these blind people are out among the living, and they 
treat their dogs like they're gold." 
</P>
<P>
To ease the pain of relinquishing Vicki, Orr immediately got Morgan and then 
Carly, Paige and Robby, all Labrador retrievers. Carly has hip dysplasia, a 
common ailment that disqualifies about 40% of potential guide dogs. So Orr 
chose to keep Carly, along with her longtime pet shepherd, Heidi. 
</P>
<P>
An employee in the public relations office at Caltech, Orr said she usually 
goes home for lunch just to check on her pets and exercise them. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Memorial Day weekend, I take my dogs to the Highland Games in Costa 
Mesa," she said of the annual Scottish ritual of games and entertainment. "I 
figure if they can get used to bagpipes, they can get used to anything. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a hobby," she said. "It's really an avocation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Higher Purpose 
</P>
<P>
Orr said that although she is tempted to spoil a lovable pup -- such as 
allowing it to sleep on her bed -- she knows that she must discipline it for a 
higher purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"They have such important work to do," she said. "If a pup gets bad habits, 
when they go into training, people have to work so much harder to correct 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Her antique-furnished home shows no signs of abuse by the three dogs she has 
now -- Carly, Robby and Heidi. They sit quietly when and where she tells them, 
and they greeted a visitor with well-behaved enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
No one is paid for raising pups for International Guiding Eyes, and the raisers 
all spend an average of $150 a year for special food. Orr explains her interest 
simply as having a lifelong love for animals. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Lang of Altadena has her fourth puppy-in-training. "It's more satisfying 
than having a pet," she said. "I love dogs so much, and now I can really 
accomplish something with that love." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Curry heads a group of puppy-raisers in the Pomona area who meet monthly to 
share training problems and ideas. "There's something in volunteer people that 
makes them want to give, and these puppy-raisers are always looking for more 
ways to give. When I can combine that with animals, I'm in heaven," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging her weepiness at the graduations, Orr said: "When I return them 
for training, I feel like I've done something worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I worry that maybe there was something more I could have done." 
</P>

POLICE DRUG-RECOGNITION TRAINING YIELDS 28 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrol officers, collaborating with police specially trained to recognize drug 
use, arrested 28 people in North Hollywood this weekend, Los Angeles police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep Friday and Saturday nights was the first time Los Angeles police 
officers in the field had worked side by side with drug-recognition experts and 
trainees, said Capt. Dan Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were booked at Van Nuys Jail on suspicion of using, possessing 
or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, police said. At least one 
person also was booked on suspicion of possessing drugs with the intent to sell 
them, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said 15 officers "hit pre-selected locations known for gang members and 
narcotic sales and use" and conducted field sobriety tests. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects -- including seven gang members -- were further tested at the 
North Hollywood station by a dozen drug-recognition officers, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
The tests revealed use of PCP, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, Valium, marijuana 
and alcohol, said Officer Sonny Medina, one of the drug-recognition experts. 
</P>
<P>
Using PCP, heroin and cocaine is a misdemeanor on the first offense and carries 
a mandatory 90-day jail sentence, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get some 90-day sentences for gang members, we can take them off the 
streets for a fairly substantial amount of time for a fairly simple arrest," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Los Angeles, Glendale, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Beverly 
Hills police departments and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department who are 
training to become drug-recognition experts conducted the tests under the 
supervision of Los Angeles police drug-recognition instructors, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Training, Fieldwork 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a drug-recognition expert requires 56 hours of classroom training and 
40 hours of fieldwork, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-step tests, which can last an hour or more, include measurements of the 
pulse, blood pressure, temperature, coordination, eye functions and other 
medical conditions to learn whether someone is impaired because of drug use 
and, if so, the drug involved. 
</P>
<P>
Testing is 98% accurate in determining if someone is under the influence and 
93% accurate in identifying the drug, Watson said.

10 HURT IN 4-VEHICLE ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten people were injured, four critically, when a car ran a red light in a 
residential neighborhood in Arleta and touched off a multi-vehicle crash 
Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of a Chevrolet Camaro failed to stop for a red light at the corner 
of Terra Bella Street and Woodman Avenue at about 7:30 p.m., said Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. Art Haversatt. The driver had alcohol on his breath and beer cans 
were found inside his car, Haversatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the Camaro ran the red light, an Isuzu pickup truck heading south on 
Woodman Avenue broadsided it, then hit a motorcycle, Haversatt said. After the 
impact, the Camaro veered across the center of the street and hit a Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo head-on. The force of the collision caused the Camaro to shift into 
reverse and make a half-turn across both lanes of traffic until it ended up on 
the lawn in front of an apartment house and hit a tree, Haversatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were trapped in one vehicle and firefighters had to use the "jaws of 
life" to extricate them, he said. Authorities would not release the names of 
those injured. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the critically injured were taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
The other two with critical injuries were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center, 
Haversatt said. The six others with less serious injuries were taken to various 
area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the outcome of a blood-alcohol test, authorities may file 
drunk-driving charges against the driver of the Camaro, Haversatt said.

SCUBA DIVER DROWNS OFF OF POINT LOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old man from Pacific Beach drowned Sunday after he became entangled 
in kelp while scuba diving off Point Loma, the coroner's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Kelley, who was diving with his brother, was last seen alive at 11:38 
a.m. when he surfaced and called for help, said Deputy Coroner Penne 
Hammersted. Kelley had lost his oxygen regulator, she said. "His brother tried 
to give him his oxygen regulator but because he (John) was in a panicky state, 
he couldn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards located Kelley about 40 feet below the surface at 12:43 p.m. 
Attempts to revive him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at UCSD 
Hospital about an hour later.

TOSHIO KINOSHITA'S LOVE FOR GAME LED TO BUSINESS EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK HAWN, Times Staff Writer

CARLSBAD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through four days of dark, rain-threatening skies, bone-chilling winds and 
occasional sunshine, 12 hours in all, he sat unobtrusively on the first tee, 
greeting professional golfers who were competing in the recent MONY Tournament 
of Champions at La Costa Resort Hotel and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
Fans repeatedly applauded the long-driving pros but paid little attention to 
the trim, broad-shouldered Japanese tournament official with the gray-streaked 
hair, wide smile and humble demeanor -- unaware, perhaps, that he heads a 
corporation that owned virtually everything in sight. 
</P>
<P>
But in the world of high finance, Toshio Kinoshita -- president of Sports 
Shinko Ltd. and the first Japanese general chairman of an American professional 
golf tournament -- needs no introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, his company's last major purchase, a costly acquisition, can use 
all the media exposure it can get, and it received a considerable amount. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on more than 420 acres, the sprawling, 23-year-old complex includes 
two 18-hole golf courses, 23 tennis courts, seven restaurants, a movie theater, 
a 60,000-square-foot spa, a 50,000-square-foot conference center and 480 rooms 
with daily rates that range from $180 to $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Shinko, based in Osaka and Tokyo, employs 4,500 people, has assets of 
$2.7 billion, a working capital of $150 million and ambitious plans for growth. 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita founded the company 30 years ago -- three years after going broke in 
his first major venture, an export-import business dealing in sundry goods. It 
lasted five years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what prompted him to start Sports Shinko, Kinoshita attempted to explain, 
finally deferring to the company's managing director, Masao Wakamori, to 
clarify. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf was a very high-class sport in Japan when he founded the company," he 
said. "Everybody couldn't play. He wanted to popularize golf. . . . He wanted 
to promote sports. He wanted to promote many different kinds of sports, out of 
which he chose golf as the best. Shinko means promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Still an avid (and sometimes frustrated) golfer who plays 70 to 80 rounds a 
year, Kinoshita has parlayed his love for a game he has been trying to master 
for three decades into huge profits. But thus far, not at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot expect profits in the very near future," Kinoshita said through 
Wakamori. "Profits may be four or five years away." 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita, who speaks English but not fluently, was also assisted in the 
interview by the parent company's general manager, Tsugio Fukuda, who said his 
boss intends to keep improving the resort "to make it the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita didn't rule out the possibility of expanding the complex if adjacent 
property could be acquired. Now, however, he is focusing on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to either buy or construct five to 10 more resorts," Wakamori 
translated, "from Washington down the coast to Florida. He likes the beach 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling broadly, Kinoshita said he is also seeking two more golf courses and 
hotels in Hawaii and plans to either buy or construct resorts on the Costa del 
Sol in Southern Spain and along the French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
"In Spain, we are in negotiation," Wakamori added. "We hope to buy the land 
within a couple of months' time." 
</P>
<P>
And Kinoshita hopes to play a big role in the shaping of it. He has designed 14 
courses, all in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a painter," he said, "oil painting, I think, and I -- what do 
you say? -- sculpture." 
</P>
<P>
The joke seemed to play well, judging from the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Shinko has a variety of businesses in Japan -- six hotels, two skiing 
resorts, a tennis resort, construction, insurance, financing and trading 
companies, a travel bureau, commercial buildings -- but golf courses dominate 
the corporation's holdings by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
The company owns 28 in Japan, three in Hawaii (Mililani Golf Club on Oahu, 
Kiahuna Golf Club on Maui and Pukalani Country Club on Kauai), three courses at 
the Grenlefe Resort near Orlando, Fla., and the two here. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Kinoshita opened a new course in Japan that offers memberships 
for $230,000, with annual dues of $300, plus a $50 fee for every round of golf. 
Drinks and food, of course, are extra. 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita purchased La Costa in November, 1987, from principal owners Allard 
Roen, Irwin Molasky and Merv Adelson for $250 million shortly after the hotel 
had undergone a two-year, $100-million-plus renovation. He then turned the 
management over to San Diego-based Global Hospitality Corp., whose chairman is 
Howard P. (Bud) James, former head of Sheraton Corp. 
</P>
<P>
James' son, Paul, the managing director, said Kinoshita doesn't spend a lot of 
time at the resort, "but he wants to know what's going on. He doesn't want any 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception in the past was that this was a private, exclusive country 
club. It's going to take time to change that thinking. La Costa is not 
inexpensive, but there are New York City and London hotels that charge more but 
don't have the facilities or services that we do. We have over 1,400 employees, 
and that's a big payroll." 
</P>
<P>
James said the hotel's occupancy during the past year averaged 65%. 
</P>
<P>
A driver who has worked under both ownerships has noticed few changes since the 
sale, "although now they give some parties that employees never got before." 
</P>
<P>
Last November, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig was a guest speaker at 
a party celebrating the resort's first anniversary under the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave a good speech," an executive's secretary recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 days at the resort, Junko Kinoshita -- the 39-year-old wife of Toshio 
-- was anxious to return to her Tokyo home and her 3-year-old daughter, Rika. 
</P>
<P>
Employed by Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Inc. in Tokyo before her 
marriage five years ago, Junko Kinoshita is well-versed in the corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
She speaks English well and, like her husband, is active in sports -- but not 
golf especially. Her game is tennis, although she didn't play here during her 
recent stay. 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita and his first wife, who died of cancer seven years ago, had three 
sons -- Satoshi, 29, Takeshi, 27, and Toshiya, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshi Kinoshita, a slightly built, rather reserved young man, worked at one 
of Sports Shinko's golf courses in Japan for a few months after graduating last 
June from Lynchburg College in Virginia, where he earned his master's in 
business administration. 
</P>
<P>
Shadowing his father during the tournament and attending various social 
functions, he undoubtedly took more than a few mental notes. In March, he will 
return to La Costa to start a training course under the guidance of Paul James. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be working in food and beverages, housekeeping, property maintenance, 
retail operations, financial planning, budgeting, marketing, advertising," 
James said. "It's a two-year program, but even then it's really a broad brush." 
</P>
<P>
The "No. 3 son," Toshiya Kinoshita, apparently has no ambitions to follow in 
his father's footsteps -- except maybe on the golf course -- and dad doesn't 
seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be a professional golfer," the sports-minded tycoon said proudly. 
"He has been playing for 12 years. He has a 3 handicap." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a young professional golfer in the Kinoshita family would be 
considered quite an honor. 
</P>
<P>
Kinoshita has played host to the annual USA-Japan matches at the Sports Shinko 
Country Club in Osaka for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
One day the host may be Satoshi Kinoshita, the eldest son. He graduated from 
the Tokyo Institute of Technology and is studying at George Washington 
University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be one of the successors," the 61-year-old executive said, without 
elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, a few days before his birthday, Kinoshita politely insisted that 
he was 60 and would not be one year older until Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
He looks sturdy enough and carries himself well but acknowledged that his golf 
game has deteriorated badly over the years (from an 8 handicap to a 20) because 
of a history of physical ailments, including a "twisted spine." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the pro-am with Steve Pate, the 1988 Tournament of Champions winner, 
Kinoshita was not having a spectacular round. In fact, he failed to break 100. 
</P>
<P>
On the final hole, he lofted a short drive, barely clearing the water in front 
of him, then, several shots later, wound up in a bunker in front of the green. 
He blasted out, skulling the ball 30 feet past the pin. Undaunted, he calmly 
two-putted for a triple-bogey 7. 
</P>
<P>
He graciously shook hands with his playing partners -- Pate and amateurs Allard 
Roen, one of the former La Costa owners, and Jim Farley, the incoming president 
of MONY Financial Services, which sponsors the annual event, then headed for a 
shower before hosting a lavish party that night. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Pate was asked to evaluate Kinoshita's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he had a par," he replied, obviously unimpressed. "But I'll say 
this: There was probably more money among that threesome than in half the 
states in the country." 
</P>

AS BUSH SETS UP SHOP, ART LAFFER IS JUST WATCHING; 
</P>
<P>
SUPPLY-SIDE CRUSADER IS FAR FROM CENTER OF POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ronald Reagan moved into the White House eight years ago, it's a safe bet 
he was toting at least one paper written by Arthur B. Laffer. 
</P>
<P>
The crusading economist, who touted the virtues of lower tax rates, voiced a 
message that the President liked to hear. Laffer's mathematical "curve" gained 
the folklore status -- if limited acceptance by other analysts. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, when a new Republican President sets up shop, Laffer and his 
fellow "supply-siders" will be far from the center of power. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a group of people who fit a time and place," Laffer, 48, said last 
week during an interview in his South Bay office, which is home to a gopher 
snake from his back yard, two snapping turtles and artifacts from all over the 
world. "To expect us to fit another time and place is not to understand us." 
</P>
<P>
Laffer's fame came at a time of great upheaval in national policy, a period 
when Reagan sought -- and won -- extraordinary tax cuts. During Reagan's 
tenure, for instance, top individual rates plunged to 33% from 70%. 
</P>
<P>
A key weapon used to persuade members of Congress to cut tax rates was the 
so-called Laffer curve, which calculated that the cuts would spur new business 
activity -- and thus new sources of government revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Laffer, an enthusiastic promoter of ideas, emerged as a general in the 
supply-side movement, an unorthodox band of analysts who stressed business 
incentives as the key to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"Art was sort of the godfather of the group, the intellectual contributing 
ideas," recalled Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp and 
an early economic adviser to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Laffer continues to offer his views to investors, politicians and 
executives. His Lomita-based financial consulting business has 300 clients, 
mainly professional investors. 
</P>
<P>
But he is often far from his Italian marble desk. A sought-after speaker, he 
says he typically logs more than 10,000 miles a week in travel to forums as 
varied as the Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce, the Wisconsin Bankers Assn. and the 
Pat Sajak show. 
</P>
<P>
Home is a 17-acre, mountain retreat in San Diego County that he shares with his 
wife, Traci, four children and a menagerie of pets including a deer (Bambi), a 
horse, numerous turtles, tropical birds, a fox, four dogs and two cats. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody offered me the presidency of the San Diego Zoo, I'd take it," said 
Laffer, a wildlife enthusiast who likes to read books on physics and biology. 
</P>
<P>
The pets and the politics do not always mix, a lesson Laffer learned in the 
1970s when one of his daughters innocently tossed a pet weasel named Fern 
toward Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't want to make it seem like she would have a heart attack or 
anything," Rachel Laffer, 16, recalled during a recent lunch at her father's 
favorite sushi restaurant. She noted that Mrs. Reagan caught the pet and handed 
it back. 
</P>
<P>
Laffer's own attempt at politics, a quest for California's 1986 Republican 
senatorial nomination, proved unsuccessful. He does not rule out a future bid 
but maintains that running for office is "not a driving ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if years in the political trenches have left Laffer with a wealth of 
memories, they have also left an aura of controversy around his economic views. 
</P>
<P>
Critics seize on the $155-billion federal budget deficit as proof that the tax 
cuts he advocated were excessive. They also dismiss the supply-side claim that 
a tax cut could pay for itself by stimulating new business activity, a claim 
Laffer says that others exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"History has contradicted, not confirmed, the Laffer hypothesis," said Robert 
Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University and past president of 
the American Economic Assn. "Certainly, I think it made no contribution to 
professional economics." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, economic consultants in 
Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the tax cuts aggravated America's financial ills, 
including the trade deficit. He described the benefits promised by Laffer and 
others as "way, way overblown." 
</P>
<P>
But in some ways Laffer's efforts are less easily dismissed. The U.S. economy 
remains in the longest peacetime expansion of the century. There is evidence 
that income tax revenues have grown even faster than the overall economy in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush, of course, has said he will not seek tax increases as a way to combat 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Laffer concedes that his optimistic budget deficit projections were "far off," 
but with characteristic lack of doubt he asserts: "The supply side won. We 
won." 
</P>
<P>
Although that view is far from universal, Laffer is not alone. "The legacy of 
the supply-siders is in place," agreed Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at 
the Bear Stearns investment firm and a former official at Reagan's Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I think economic policy has been and will continue to be influenced by the 
thinking of Art Laffer and (other supply-siders)," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that thinking will reach the inner levels of the Bush Administration is 
uncertain. The incoming President seems to be relying more on 
middle-of-the-road thinkers than on ideologues to solve the economy's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Laffer, a national co-chairman for the Bush campaign, sees a logic in this. 
Reagan, he reasons, sought vaulting changes in tax and other policies. By 
contrast, Bush will aim more for careful consensus with the 
Democratic-controlled Congress -- and will turn to advisers with a similar 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bush is the perfect guy to succeed Reagan," said Laffer, describing 
the incoming President as a "manager" and the outgoing one as a "peaceful 
revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
Intellectual thunder and lightning may draw Laffer more than the methodical 
fine-tuning of management, but he acknowledges that "I would love to be a 
(Bush) adviser as I was with Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether that will happen, he said: "I think I'll be fine with the Bush 
Administration. I don't see why I wouldn't be. That doesn't mean they want me 
to be a Cabinet secretary -- but I don't want to be one either."

General Electric Co. of Britain and U.S.-based General Electric Co. said they 
plan to merge their European consumer products, medical equipment and some 
electrical divisions. The U.S.-based GE plans to pay the British-based firm 
$579 million (325 million pounds) in cash as part of the merger of their 
European operations, the companies said. The annual revenue of the combined 
European operations of the two General Electrics would come to about $2.45 
billion.

Robert B. Anderson, U.S. Treasury secretary under President Eisenhower, has 
been disbarred for tax evasion and illegal banking activities. Anderson, 78, 
pleaded guilty in 1987 to evading taxes on $240,000 in income for 1983 and 
1984, and operating an illegal bank in which investors lost $4.4 million. He 
was sentenced to a month in jail and five months' house arrest, fined $500,000 
and ordered to enter an alcohol treatment program.

QUALITY OF CORPORATE, MUNICIPAL BONDS ERODED IN '88, FIRM REPORTS

<P>
The overall quality of both corporate and municipal bonds declined in 1988, a 
credit-monitoring firm has said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary data, a record 386 corporate bond ratings were lowered 
last year, representing $171 billion of debt, according to Standard &amp; 
Poor's Corp. The previous record was the 364 downgrades in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, 261 corporate bond ratings were raised last year, representing $158 
billion in debt, S&amp;P said in a report released Friday. The number of 
upgrades in 1988 far surpassed the old high of 188 in 1987, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of ratings is greater than the number of companies issuing bonds 
because differing types of bonds issued by the same company receive separate 
ratings, S&amp;P said. 
</P>
<P>
Several leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, especially in the retail 
industry, accounted for some of the lowered ratings, S&amp;P said. 
</P>
<P>
Notable upgrades included Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which 
together accounted for $42 billion of debt. 
</P>
<P>
The company said a negative trend continued in the ratings of debt offerings of 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In municipal bonds, S&amp;P said large declines in the quality of housing, 
utility and hospital issues more than offset positive trends in general 
obligation and airport, port and college revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it lowered the ratings on 266 issues representing about $23 
billion of debt, while it raised the ratings on 112 issues equaling about $17 
billion of debt. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 269 municipal issues representing about $16.5 billion in debt were 
downgraded, while 153 ratings on $25 billion in debt were raised. 
</P>
<P>
The number of municipal bond issues increased in 1988 as the market recovered 
from the federal tax reform act, S&amp;P said. A total of 2,094 issues were 
rated last year, of which 82 were taxable. In 1987, 1,817 issues were rated, 
including 70 taxables.

Boston Co.'s profits for the first three quarters of 1988 were overstated by 
$30 million, more than twice as high as preliminary estimates, officials with 
the investment firm said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Boston Co.'s parent firm, said 
Friday that a committee of outside auditors and Shearson officers arrived at 
the higher estimate after an examination of Boston's financial position. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the panel was trying to determine who was responsible for 
the overstatement.

U.S. SEEKS SWISS HELP IN TRIANGLE INSIDER PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
Swiss government officials have said that the United States has asked for their 
assistance in a probe of possible insider trading in Triangle Industries Inc. 
shares before its acquisition last November. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told Switzerland on Dec. 16 that it 
suspected that insiders were at work shortly before France's state-owned 
Pechiney SA launched a $1.26-billion bid for Triangle, a major New York-based 
packaging company, in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has frozen an unspecified number of accounts at Swiss 
Volksbank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Banca della Svizzera Italiana and the 
Vaud Cantonal Bank pending a formal request for legal assistance from the SEC, 
a Justice Ministry official said. She declined to identify the banks' owners. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC had alerted France to a tenfold jump in Triangle share trading the week 
before Pechiney's agreed takeover was announced. Pechiney paid $56 a share for 
stock for which French investors had paid about $10.50 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in Triangle totaled 200,000 shares for the three-day period of Nov. 
16-18, whereas normal daily trading in Triangle shares on the New York 
over-the-counter market averaged 5,000 to 20,000 shares. Pechiney's bid was 
announced Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
French regulatory officials investigating the case have said more than five but 
fewer than 10 French operators bought Triangle shares, but have declined to 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Paris banking sources said Triangle buy orders had also been placed through 
Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland on behalf of French investors. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC and officials from its French counterpart, the COB, were set to meet in 
Paris to coordinate the expanded investigation of the trading. 
</P>
<P>
Triangle Chairman Nelson Peltz said in an interview with France's Nouvel 
Observateur magazine published last week that he had been summoned before the 
SEC in New York and would appear in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry has led to a political row in France after published reports that 
some leading government officials face questioning in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy was pressed by opponents of the Socialist 
government for a parliamentary inquiry into how some investors had advance 
knowledge of the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Max Theret, a businessman close to the ruling Socialist Party, has confirmed 
that he bought shares in Triangle before the deal but said that it was an 
unfortunate coincidence. Socialist government officials denied involvement of 
any top-level ministers, including President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative RPR, the biggest opposition party, said: "The names of 
prominent people close to the presidential palace and the Ministry of Finance 
are being implicated, and there is a growing feeling in public opinion that 
facts are being suppressed in the Pechiney case." 
</P>
<P>
Beregovoy on Thursday rose to the defense of his top aide, Alain Boublil, named 
in the right-wing French press as one of those under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The current campaign of rumors which has involved my Cabinet Director Alain 
Boublil is not a healthy campaign. I am surrounded by honest men in whom I have 
confidence," he said.

WHAT GENDER GAP?; 
</P>
<P>
THE WOMEN'S VOTE WAS A DECIDING FACTOR IN ELECTING BUSH, FEMINISTS AND ANALYSTS 
NOW SAY

<P>
When the presidential election campaign began, George Bush was not the 
preferred candidate of the organized women's movement. Michael Dukakis had a 
20-point lead among women voters and a track record mostly in accord with the 
feminist agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the election year, feminist leaders predicted that women would elect 
the next President. Yet when the election was over, it seemed as though they 
had cried "gender gap" once too often. 
</P>
<P>
But with this week's impending inauguration of the 41st President, political 
analysts and feminists are now discussing, with a mixture of consternation and 
vindication, a hypothesis that says the feminists were right all along. 
</P>
<P>
Newly released data suggest the narrowing of the gender gap from that original 
20-point lead to only a six-point difference was a major factor in deciding the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Took Women Seriously 
</P>
<P>
In explaining what happened, analysts and leaders of the organized women's 
movement are putting it bluntly: the Bush campaign took women seriously; the 
Dukakis campaign took women for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gender canyon the Republicans were facing last spring," Vince 
Breglio, president of Research Strategy and Management and a pollster for 
Bush/Quayle '88, said recently. "There was no way we could win with numbers 
like that. Targeting of women was a priority." 
</P>
<P>
At best, he said, all Republicans face a built-in gap, because women are more 
heavily Democratic: Out of every 10 women voters, 4 almost always vote 
Democratic, 2.5 vote Republican and 3.5 are split-voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to win 2.5 of the splits. It was a major, major task, and we 
accomplished it," Breglio said. 
</P>
<P>
In what was the first presidential election in which men and women differed 
significantly in their vote, exit polls interviews showed that 54% of the men 
chose Bush; 52% of the women chose Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gender Gap Favored Dukakis 
</P>
<P>
Breglio's analysis sounded in no way at odds with that of Democratic pollster 
and vice president of the Analysis Group, Celinda Lake, who agreed that the 
built-in gender gap favors Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats still have an edge with women, but they don't appreciate that 
you can't take it for granted. They did not target women; Dukakis did not 
effectively target any group. He did at the end in California and it was very 
effective," she said, but repeated the "too little, too late" comments many 
have made. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans did not take (women) for granted. They may have responded 
symbolically, but they responded. The Democratic campaign did not listen and 
develop a strategy at the national level," Lake said, adding that they let Bush 
control and set the agenda and define Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Both Breglio and Lake presented their analyses -- as did political scientist 
Ethel Klein of Columbia University -- to more than 1,000 participants at the 
recent Women's Agenda Conference II organized by BPW/USA (the National 
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs) in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
According to Klein, what the campaign had produced by election day was a 
climate in which women did not so much vote for George Bush as they decided not 
to vote against him. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, a coalition of more than 50 national women's organizations with 
a combined, bipartisan membership of 10 million, first met last January in Des 
Moines, Iowa. Last year they adopted an agenda for the presidential campaign 
calling for a broad range of family policies, health care, reproductive freedom 
and economic equality, and a budget that balanced defense and development. This 
year they stood behind the same agenda, in an effort to make their concerns 
known to the new Administration and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing the gender gap briefing, BPW president Betty Forbes said: "Women 
were a majority of the electorate Nov. 8; by early estimates, by as much as 8 
million votes." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes took note of Bush's successful strategy, highlighting not only his 
appearance at the BPW national convention soon after the GOP convention, where 
he announced his national child-care program, but also his call for a "kinder, 
gentler" nation and the high visibility of women in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis' choice of Susan Estrich as campaign manager notwithstanding, many 
Democratic women have criticized the campaign for the lack of a role for women. 
In Los Angeles, Marilyn Kezziah, coordinator of a liberal, bipartisan group, 
Women For, said: "(The Dukakis campaign) wanted the usual scut (menial) work, 
and did not see them as policy makers. Of course women had a great deal of 
frustration with the entire Democratic Party. Paul Kirk (chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee) at the beginning said he did not want to see 
special interest groups dominate, 'like women.' Women are hardly a 
</P>
<P>
special interest group." 
</P>
<P>
Saying in the final analysis that a presidential election gets down to "who can 
make the best future for the country," Breglio said Bush stressed economic 
issues, the national deficit and foreign policy and, at the same time, 
successfully "articulated his personal agenda," which included child care, 
education, health and children. 
</P>
<P>
The charges of fear tactics and racism that were attached to Bush's use of 
Dukakis' furloughing of convicted rapist Willie Horton became, in Breglio's 
analysis, the broader area of crime and drug abuse: "It focused on what most 
people picked up on as a vulnerability of the Dukakis record -- a lack of 
judgment and feeling. . . . Bush emerged as a stronger leader." 
</P>
<P>
While women leaders at the conference and elsewhere did not praise Bush for his 
use of the Willie Horton issue, several did give him credit for having spotted 
"a women's issue" and took themselves to task for not being more sensitive to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"What we haven't acknowledged is that there is a fear side to women, from their 
personal security to national security," Sarah Harder, president of the 
American Assn. of University Women, said. "(Women) will continue to be 
manipulated by the specter of violence, whether it's Willie Horton or the Evil 
Empire, until we are ready to provide contrasting, empowering images as 
compelling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Gap Narrowed 
</P>
<P>
Celinda Lake credited the narrowing of the gap to three actions Bush took: "He 
broke with Ronald Reagan at the convention and said, 'I'm not him;' he showed 
that he understood the modern family, and talked of day care and education, 
saying he was willing to use government as a tool to help; third, he said he 
was for change. On the eve of the election, men were for the status quo and 
women were for change." 
</P>
<P>
Since women's experience made them more pessimistic about the economy, the 
improvement of the short-term economy by Election Day helped, Lake said. "They 
(the Republicans) worked hard to change the way women thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
Former campaign manager Estrich dismissed much of the criticism of Dukakis and 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that each year the gender gap tends to narrow as the election 
gets closer. It's largely a reflection of economic issues," she said. "It 
involves women who do not self-identify as feminists, who are not liberals or 
progressives and who do not necessarily belong to traditional or new women's 
organizations. It was not the membership of the feminist, organized women's 
movement that was up for grabs. It was conservative women and some went back to 
him. His appeal with an issue such as crime went to that constituency, not 
women with more liberal progressive views." 
</P>
<P>
Estrich said Dukakis did take women seriously, did address a full range of 
economic issues and went out on a limb to make abortion and his support of 
existing legislation an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," she said, "a very conscious effort to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort at the End 
</P>
<P>
Ann Lewis, a political consultant to business and professional women and a 
former political director for the Democratic National Committee, watched that 
conscious effort -- at the end of the campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The women (both parties) had to reach, the potential splits, are issue-driven. 
The Dukakis campaign nationally failed to reach them. Those of us who watched 
it happen in California could see that it worked, but not in time." 
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Estrich were Irene Natividad, president of the National 
Women's Political Caucus, and Kate Michaelman of NARAL, the National Abortions 
Rights Action League. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Dukakis lost an opportunity," Michaelman said. "He had a record. He 
had philosophical position. He didn't use it . . . . Reproductive freedom, even 
when it was used negatively, was the issue that galvanized people. Women were 
ready to be tapped as a political force. . . . In the end, many didn't vote for 
George Bush because of his positions, but they did not get out and vote for 
Michael Dukakis." 
</P>
<P>
Natividad described Dukakis' women strategy as "a serious attempt not to 
address the issues." 
</P>
<P>
As far as shortcomings of the organized women's movement itself, she said: "I 
think we should have picked up the ball in terms of our relations with the 
Democratic Party. The message from the campaign to all constituencies was, 'Be 
quiet. You know where he is.' We should have been more forceful to call the 
campaign's attention to what mistakes were being made." 
</P>
<P>
What this all means for the future is still uncertain, but the women are clear 
that there will be no honeymoon with George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush has a real mandate to fulfill," Lake said. "Women did not fall in 
love with him. They made up their minds at the last moment. Will he deliver 
substantively on child care, education . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
Harder agreed. She said a Bush message delivered to the recent conference by 
video and by surrogates seemed to be "resistance to solutions like family 
medical leave. It still boils down to no new taxes, no new mandates. How they 
get beyond lip service, beyond once more effectively seducing women" remains to 
be seen. For starters, she said, they are looking closely at the number and 
level of female appointments he makes. 
</P>
<P>
For all the what-could-have-beens and wariness about future relations between 
the women's movement and the Bush Administration, there seems little 
self-criticism among the women themselves, who seem to see the election as 
proof of their growing importance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Issue-Driven Voters' 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Smeal, the founder/president of Fund for the Feminist Majority, wrote a 
book in 1984 called "Why and How Women Will Elect the Next President." She did 
not sound at all apologetic about that title when asked about the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Women voters are not only the majority, they are issue-driven voters," she 
said of the lessons of the election. "They not only affect whom we choose but 
the agenda they run on. It was a little confusing in this election because we 
broke our votes. But a key change was that the quest for women's votes 
dominated the winning campaign. . . . Now there's no need to prove (the gender 
gap)." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Ann Lewis pointed to two courses of action necessary in the next 
four years. "Raise the political activity of our members and raise the 
political responsibility of the political system around our priority issues," 
she said.

LAST ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
HOMESTEADER'S GRANDSON FORCED TO LEAVE BUNKHOUSE WHERE 3 GENERATIONS LIVED 
SINCE 1923 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troy Thomas rummaged through an old bunkhouse, trying to figure out what links 
to the past he could take. 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of his family had lived in the San Juan Capistrano house 
since 1923, so Thomas' biggest decision was not what to take but more what to 
leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
The two wood stoves were too big, so he sold them off. The dresser drawers 
which he slept in as a baby were also too large, so he left them behind. 
Antique cameras, a World War II-vintage phonograph and overstuffed furniture -- 
where his family would sit and gaze at the surf down below their hilltop home 
-- were also too cumbersome for him to move. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Thomas, 36, went away with practically nothing at all, unsure of 
what to do or where to go after spending most of his adult life living in the 
bunkhouse, savoring a way of life that has all but vanished in Orange County's 
urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is the last of three generations of San Juan Capistrano ranch hands who 
were allowed to live free on the property they worked. But with the ranch no 
longer in existence and development finally planned for the family's hilltop 
spread, Thomas was evicted last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the developer will be bulldozing the two World War I-era Army barracks 
that served as Thomas' family's home, as well as a dilapidated, reddish-brown 
barn where Thomas' grandfather used to put out a barrel to collect rainwater 
cascading off the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"It's devastating to me," Thomas said sadly last week as he packed up his 
belongings to move in temporarily with some local relatives. "The hardest part 
about moving is the emotional feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' homesteading way of life used to be commonplace in Orange County, when 
huge ranches and farms covered hundreds of thousands of acres, said Orange 
County Farm Bureau Manager Thelma Moses. Today, Moses estimates there are only 
60,000 acres of agricultural land left in the county. 
</P>
<P>
During the early part of this century, as many as a dozen large ranches were 
spread across the hills and flatlands south of what is now Irvine, said 
Priscilla Hoel, a tour guide for the county's Heritage Hill Historical Park in 
El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time when workers -- like Thomas' relatives -- lived on the property 
free in exchange for their labors, Hoel said. Many, she added, were even 
allowed to plant their own small farms. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of heavy urban development that rolled across Orange County following 
World War II led to the break-up of most of those ranches, Hoel said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, no one knows how many ranch homesteaders are left in the county. But 
Gilbert Aguirre, senior vice president of Rancho Mission Viejo, which operates 
a 40,000-acre ranch in the south county, said there can't be more than a 
handful. Aguirre noted that his ranch only has "two or three" hands living on 
the property without having to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
"That was common years ago if a person spent that much time (working a ranch), 
but that's a thing of the past," Aguirre said, adding that workers today can 
easily be brought in to the most rugged areas with 4-wheel-drive vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' grandfather, John Anatole Ebargaray first homesteaded a hilltop in San 
Juan Capistrano in 1923 as part of his payment for working as foreman of the 
300-acre Forster Ranch in Forster Canyon, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch, also known as "Boca de la Playa" (mouth of the beach) because of its 
proximity to the sea, was a tiny remnant of a 6,600-acre spread that dated to 
1846, when California still was part of Mexico, said Orange County historian 
Jim Sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
Originally acquired as a Mexican land grant by a local justice of the peace, 
the ranch was purchased in 1882 by Marcos A. Forster, son of Orange County land 
baron Juan Forster, Sleeper said. Bits and pieces gradually were sold off by 
the Forster family. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few hundred acres were left by the time Ebargaray, a Basque sheepherder 
from France, arrived in Orange County. He used up almost every remaining acre 
of the little ranch by planting fields of barley and wheat in the canyon and 
allowing herds of as many as 300 sheep to graze along the rolling hillsides, 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas remembers a youth of hard work. For long hours, he recalled, he would 
have to stand on the back of a wagon pulled by a tractor and throw seeds out 
over the barley and wheat fields. Today, the wagon sits in the family's front 
yard, a rusted and forgotten relic. 
</P>
<P>
Caring for sheep in the coyote-infested hills also was a mighty chore, Thomas 
said. The sheep were kept at night in a wooden corral near the bunkhouse, and 
dogs were kept at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
Brush fires were also a constant concern, especially during periods of dry 
Santa Ana winds. A hillside of Forster Canyon still bears the scars of an 
immense brush fire 20 years ago that Thomas said very nearly enveloped the 
bunkhouse before it was put out by firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three vans and two pickups loaded just in case," Thomas recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Even life's essentials weren't taken for granted. For many years, the family 
had to depend on a well for its water, Thomas said, and there was no indoor 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty of good times, too. After the hard work of the day was 
over, ranch-hand families from miles around would converge on the then-tiny 
communities of San Juan Capistrano and El Toro to receive their daily mail and 
exchange gossip at the country store, Hoel said. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, Hoel said, the ranch hands kicked up their heels at a redwood 
dance hall in El Toro, which during the early part of this century served as a 
social Mecca for south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
There also was plenty of after-hours socializing at the ranch bunkhouses 
themselves. Thomas recalls vividly the big parties his grandfather held, in 
which Basque sheepherders and their families from all over the south county 
would congregate in the Ebargaray's back yard to eat and drink all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Inside a stone pit there -- now buried with garbage and debris -- the 
Ebargarays would roast pig and lamb, butchered in the barn nearby. Atop a 
grill, now rusted and half-buried in weeds, they laid strips of meat to 
barbecue, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July was always the most festive time, Thomas recalled, because 
it was both a national holiday and his grandfather's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch continued operating until 1966, when Marcos Forster Jr. died and the 
land was sold to help pay inheritance taxes, said Pat Forster, Forster's son. 
</P>
<P>
As Ebargaray and his wife had died shortly before Marcos Forster's death, Pat 
Forster said, a verbal agreement was made by the new landowner that all 14 of 
the couple's children would be allowed to live free on the property until they 
died or it was developed, whichever happened first. 
</P>
<P>
The land changed hands several times after that, but it was never developed -- 
although new housing developments have crowded in from all sides. The verbal 
agreement finally ended on Dec. 23, 1987, when Lucana Ebargaray Thomas -- the 
last surviving sibling of John and Josefina Ebargaray -- died of a kidney 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the only other family member living on the property was Lucana's son 
Troy. Troy Thomas has two older sisters, but they married and moved away. 
</P>
<P>
Although he worked 14 years doing street repairs in Laguna Beach (he said he 
had been unemployed in recent years) Thomas continued living alone in the ranch 
house until Tuesday, when he was ordered off the property by TMC Developments 
Inc. of Costa Mesa, the latest property owner. 
</P>
<P>
"As you know, your right to occupy the premises expired with your mother's 
passing away," TMC attorney Todd G. Olson told Thomas in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
TMC Developments served Thomas notice two months ago that he would have to move 
by Dec. 1, because the company said it soon would be ready to build a 
residential planned community of more than 500 units. 
</P>
<P>
But that moving date was extended until Tuesday to give Thomas time to try and 
put his affairs in order, said Mike Schlesinger, project director for TMC 
Communities, a branch of the development company. In addition, the company gave 
Thomas $2,000 to assist in his relocation. Olson noted in his letter that the 
company did not have to give Thomas anything. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas glumly proclaimed that the money was not nearly enough to help him find 
a home in Orange County, where the average new home is selling for around 
$300,000. In the McCracken Hill development just across the street from the old 
ranch house, homes are selling from $450,000 to nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, he said, is it enough to compensate for the anxiety he is having to endure 
from seeing his family's home of 60 years swallowed up by development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a bummer; that's all you can say," Thomas said. Nearby residents 
expressed sadness at seeing Thomas and his rustic way of life disappear forever 
from the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of sad because it's been part of us up here," said Leigh 
Braithwaite, a housewife who lives directly across Forster Canyon Road from the 
ranch house. She said Thomas was "heartbroken that he's leaving. He doesn't 
know any other place."

VIGIL TO COMMEMORATE KEY ABORTION RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that 16 years ago struck down many 
state laws forbidding abortion will be commemorated next Sunday during a 
30-minute vigil to be conducted by the National Organization for Women, north 
county chapter, and the Unitarian Church of Orange County in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Participants, each holding a candle, will gather at the corner of Glassell 
Street and Almond Avenue at 5 p.m., then march down an alley in memory of women 
who died from "back-alley" abortions before abortion laws were changed, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Then a brief memorial service will be held, followed by a march around Orange 
Plaza at Glassell Street and Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Before the court's 1973 decision, most states prohibited abortions unless there 
were special circumstances, such as a threat to the mother's health or life.

NOTEBOOK: KING HOLIDAY RECALLS A TIME OF ANGUISH IN ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a warm evening on April 8, nearly 21 years ago, and Chattanooga was an 
eerie ghost town -- not a person in sight or a car on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks from its drab, nearly empty bus station, I was stopped by a 
policeman in a squad car. I told him I had a 1 hour stopover and was looking 
for a restaurant. He politely ordered me back to my bus. He said the city was 
under a curfew because of race riots. 
</P>
<P>
I was a college student from a small town in Indiana, on my way to a funeral in 
Atlanta. The funeral and the riots were related. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, at Ebenezer Baptist Church, a large but unpretentious brick 
structure in downtown Atlanta, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lay in state beneath 
the pulpit where he had preached many times. Where his father had preached 
before him and his maternal grandfather before that. 
</P>
<P>
Just 3 weeks earlier, King had given a speech in Anaheim, to the California 
Democratic Council, about injustice in the land and how we all must participate 
in the struggle for equality. Two days later he was in Memphis, Tenn., to lend 
support to striking garbage workers. 
</P>
<P>
Cities across the country erupted in flames after King's assassination in 
Memphis on April 4, 1968. But in Atlanta, on this day, the outlet for despair 
was more grief than anger. 
</P>
<P>
It was an unforgettable assembly of tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The line outside the church ran for blocks and blocks. People had waited for 
hours just to pay a brief moment of respect and then dab at their eyes and 
choke on their words as they left the church. 
</P>
<P>
"They done slew the King, that's what they done," I remember an old man saying 
as he stood in line just off the church steps. 
</P>
<P>
I stood outside with the throng during the morning service and listened as 
King's own recorded words filled the loudspeaker. I walked a few minutes ahead 
of the funeral cortege, which would wind its way 5 miles across the city to 
Morehouse College, King's alma mater, for an outdoor service. 
</P>
<P>
The memory moves me still today. The complete route, from the church door to 
the white-columned portico of Morehouse's Harkness Hall, was lined with people, 
in many places four and five deep, mourning the loss of a leader. 
</P>
<P>
I'd had no idea. What I knew about King and the civil rights struggle had come 
through the news media. These people had lived it with him. 
</P>
<P>
I saw the pain in Bobby Kennedy's face as he made his way along the route in 
shirt-sleeves. I saw the King children and recalled reading King's account of 
how the joy of taking them to an amusement park was thwarted by the whites-only 
restrictions in effect on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
I remember Mahalia Jackson's moving rendition of "Precious Lord, Take My Hand" 
and how first one, then another around me fainted as she sang. It was a 
combination of the unseasonable heat and the emotion she wrung from the song. 
</P>
<P>
I remember Harry Belafonte's tears and the masses singing "We Shall Overcome." 
On the first note, a young black woman next to me put her hand in mine and 
nodded for me to take the hand of the man to my left. I thought of the sadness 
around me and wondered what awaited all of us in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Today is a national holiday, in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. 
My son sees it as a day off from school. That's OK. He's 6 years old. But many 
Americans remain puzzled about why Martin Luther King should be specially 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
I wish they could have been there that day in Atlanta.

REV. SCHULLER TO BE SEEN ON EUROPEAN TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller's "Hour of Power" television ministry will soon be 
broadcast to cable TV subscribers in 21 European nations over a satellite that 
belongs to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, a Schuller aide said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch will broadcast the weekly program, which is taped at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove, to cable TV networks over his London-based Sky 
Channel at no cost to Schuller, said Warren Duffy, Schuller's top aide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Opened the Door' 
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted to have one hour of religious programming on his Sky Channel," 
Duffy said. "He opened the door by making this offer to us." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch and Schuller met several months ago, and Murdoch attended services at 
the Crystal Cathedral one Sunday, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we'd hear from him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be picked up by more than 5,700 cable networks -- with a 
potential total audience of 36.8 million people -- in virtually every major 
Western European country except Italy. "Hour of Power" will also reach viewers 
in Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement read by Duffy, Schuller said: "This is the first time 
in the history of religious communication that a worldwide platform has been 
given to a spokesman of the Christian religion. . . . No congregation has been 
picked to be the one church service to be seen in so many cities and so many 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suffered Financially 
</P>
<P>
The "Hour of Power" ministry is among the top-rated U.S. religious broadcasts, 
but it has suffered financially the past year, a circumstance that Schuller has 
attributed to "shock waves" following television-evangelist controversies 
involving figures such as Jim and Tammy Bakker, Oral Roberts and Jimmy 
Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast operation's budget was $34 million in 1987, but it was cut to $26 
million in 1988 because of fund-raising difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
But while Murdoch's offer will enable Schuller to expand the reach of his 
ministry, it will not allow him to ask for financial help. One of the 
conditions of the deal is that the 5-minute plea for donations normally 
included in each "Hour of Power" be excised from the program when it is 
broadcast in Europe, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Solicitation 
</P>
<P>
"Under the regulations of the United Kingdom, donations of money cannot be 
solicited through such programs," Duffy said. "Normally, we ask viewers to 
write in and support the ministry. But since this is free, we don't have to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The program will be broadcast in English, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what level of support there is there," he said. "But 
Schuller's way of presenting the gospel is so unique. This will be the first 
time they have heard the good news proclaimed in such a way. . . . They are 
very traditional over there. This will be something refreshing and compelling 
to all of Europe."

CORONA DEL MAR'S JULIE SMITH DOESN'T LET INJURY KEEP HER DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Lowery 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julie Smith had a feeling something like this was going to happen. Playing for 
the Corona del Mar High School girls' soccer team, a.k.a. Team 911, it was just 
a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
At one time or another this season, seemingly every player on Corona del Mar 
has been hurt or ill. At one point, Corona del Mar had eight seniors out with 
various afflictions. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's time came Thursday, with 10 minutes remaining in the first half of 
Corona del Mar's match against Sea View League rival Newport Harbor. Smith, on 
a breakaway, had her heel clipped from behind and fell hard on her right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Though Smith couldn't raise her right arm more than a few inches and had to 
latch her right hand to her shorts "just to keep my arm straight," she remained 
in the match. 
</P>
<P>
She felt she couldn't come out because Corona del Mar's only reserve, Susie 
Peters, was available but had just come off an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really got beat up this season," said John Nguyen, Corona del Mar coach. 
</P>
<P>
The team's record hasn't, however. Corona del Mar, defending Sea View League 
champions, is 9-5-4 overall and 1-1 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 4-year starter who has stayed healthy enough to be described by Nguyen 
as "my iron woman," was told at halftime that she had a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 0-0, Smith decided to play the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell on it one time and that was really scary," Smith said. "And it was 
frightening to get into a crowd of people." 
</P>
<P>
Smith assisted on the only goal in the match, dribbling across midfield and 
passing to Kristen Borland, who took a shot that deflected off the goal. 
Prentice Perkins, who had a 102-degree temperature the day before, got the 
rebound and scored with 5 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of made it all worth it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has the right arm in a sling, said her family doctor has told that 
her she'll be out a week or two. She says she'll be practicing by Wednesday so 
she can play in Thursday's match against Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"We went undefeated through league last year, but we tied Tustin twice," Smith 
said. "So you can see why I want to play." 
</P>
<P>
There's a euphemism for a basketball player with an ability to make a shot no 
matter the circumstance. Shooters like that are called unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Lee Green. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, during Fullerton's Freeway League game against La Habra, Green fell on 
his head going for a rebound and had to be carried to the Fullerton bench with 
what Coach Chris Burton described as "a golf ball on his forehead." 
</P>
<P>
With 55 seconds to play, Fullerton, which had trailed by as many as 16 points 
in the fourth quarter, had rallied to trail, 68-66, in large part because of 
guard Rene Arias, who scored 16 of his 35 points in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball and 11 seconds to go, Fullerton called timeout. Burton knew that 
La Habra would be keying on Arias and forward Pete Bach, who came into the game 
averaging 18 points a game. Burton looked at Green, a shooting guard who came 
into the game averaging 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Lee if he thought he could play," Burton said. "He looked at me for a 
second, then said he thought so." 
</P>
<P>
Burton put Arias and Bach on one side of the court, to draw La Habra's defense, 
and Green on the other. Green came off a screen, received the ball at the top 
of the key and let sail with a 3-point shot that gave Fullerton a 69-68 lead. 
Fullerton added 2 free throws to win, 71-68. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably a foot behind the 3-point line when he let that thing go," 
Burton said. "I've always told him when he shoots to just go unconscious and 
let it happen. Looks like he listened to me." 
</P>
<P>
There were a couple of big victories last week by a couple of boys' basketball 
programs that haven't had a lot to cheer about recently. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, San Clemente beat El Toro, 56-49. San Clemente came into the game 
with only three victories and had never beaten El Toro in Dion Kerhoulas' 3 
years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro came in with 10 victories and Khari Johnson, one of the county's top 
players, who has signed to attend UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Kerhoulas stuck Eddie Morgan, a 6-foot 6-inch sophomore, on Johnson for much of 
the game. Johnson, who came into the game averaging 16 points a game, got only 
4. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan is one of two sophomores who start for San Clemente; the other is Bill 
Hagedorn. Kerhoulas also starts two juniors. San Clemente has played well 
against tough competition, but its inexperience always seems to show up. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente was leading Capistrano Valley, ranked No. 5 in Orange County, by 3 
points with 3 minutes left in the first half earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the bottom just dropped out," Kerhoulas said. 
</P>
<P>
That translates into 28 consecutive points by Capistrano Valley. San Clemente 
lost, 84-50. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're as young as we are, things like that are going to happen," 
Kerhoulas said. "That's why it was real good for them to get the win against El 
Toro." 
</P>
<P>
Kerhoulas said there was "no pandemonium after the game" because his team had 
played steady throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Such was not the case Friday when Garden Grove beat defending Garden Grove 
League and 3-A champion Kennedy, 37-35, in overtime at Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Bedlam basically broke out," said Gene Campbell, who has coached at Garden 
Grove for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who watched his team lose two games to Kennedy last season, each time 
by more than 40 points, slowed the tempo down Friday. Way down. 
</P>
<P>
"We just pulled the ball out. We knew that if we went head up with them, they'd 
blow us out," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the strategy, Garden Grove, which came into the game with only two 
victories, found itself down by 11, 33-22, with 4:48 left. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck York, the team's designated 3-point shooter, hit one to cut the lead to 
33-25. After the shot, Garden Grove's Brian Tran attempted to call a timeout, 
but was pushed as he ran toward a referee. Kennedy was called for a flagrant 
foul. Tran made both free throws to cut the lead to 33-27, and Garden Grove got 
the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Gilbert Alavarez penetrated and passed to Joe Squyres, who made a 
layup and was fouled. Squyres made the free throw to pull Garden Grove to 33-30 
with 2:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored to lead, 35-30, but Tran answered with a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy turned the ball over on a pass thrown out of bounds, and Garden Grove 
got the ball back with 1:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove held the ball until 19 seconds remained when York missed a 
3-pointer. Julian Velas got an offensive rebound but missed on the follow. York 
got the rebound, dribbled out beyond the 3-point line and set sail with 
another. This one went in with 4 seconds to go and tied the score, 35-35. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy missed a desperation shot, then missed its first shot in overtime with 
2:48 left. Garden Grove held the ball until Campbell called timeout with 13 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's 10-foot jump shot put Garden Grove up, 37-35. Kennedy missed a long jump 
shot at the buzzer and Campbell and his players were mobbed by a capacity home 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said this was only the third time he had run a slowdown game. In 1978 
he held the ball against a Los Amigos team destined to be a Southern Section 
finalist. 
</P>
<P>
"Clayton Olivier (who played at USC) made 2 free throws late and we lost by 1," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, against a La Quinta team that would win the Garden Grove League title, 
Campbell held the ball and lost by 2 on a last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he was so happy it worked against Kennedy that "I couldn't sleep 
at all Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
Streaks go and go on: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Huntington Beach boys' basketball team defeated Ocean View, ranked No. 
7 in Orange County, 74-65, Friday. It was Huntington Beach's first victory over 
Ocean View in 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach, which entered Sunset League play with a 5-8 record, is a 
surprising 2-1 in league play. Wednesday, Huntington Beach beat Marina, 62-61, 
on Jeff Long's shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Woodbridge boys' basketball team lost to Laguna Hills, 68-62, Friday. 
It was the first Pacific Coast League loss for Woodbridge, which had won 22 in 
a row over 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With its 48-7 Century League-opening victory over El Modena Thursday, the 
Canyon wrestling team has won 47 consecutive Century League matches spanning 10 
years. The last time the Comanches lost was to El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Mission Viejo girls' soccer team just keeps rolling along. Thursday's 
match against Irvine was supposed to be a major test. Some even thought Irvine 
would end Mission Viejo's national record of 82 matches without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Mission Viejo 6, Irvine 1. 
</P>
<P>
What's a coach to do? 
</P>
<P>
Alex Acosta, Bishop Amat boys' basketball coach, was suffering through a 
miserable second half Friday in which his team scored just 17 points en route 
to a 61-40 Angelus League loss to Servite. 
</P>
<P>
His team made only one shot outside 8 feet and scored only 4 points in the 
third quarter. And only four Bishop Amat players would score. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta was trying everything to shake his team up. He had his players run, he 
slowed them down, they shot from the outside, they tried to jam the ball inside 
the key. Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, exasperated, Acosta yelled his last-gasp order: "Don't shoot! Just 
don't shoot!" 
</P>
<P>
But a Bishop Amat player did anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He missed. 
</P>
<P>
Former Fountain Valley High kicker Micky Penaflor of Northern Arizona 
University has been named to Football News' first-team All-American team for 
Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Penaflor, a junior, established a Northern Arizona career scoring record with 
180 points. Last season, he scored 90 points, making 19 of 24 field goal 
attempts, the longest from 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Penaflor's best game came on national television against Northern Iowa when he 
made 6 of 7 field goal attempts, the second most productive day for a 
field-goal kicker in a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. I-AA division game. 
Penaflor's coach, Goran Ling-merth, set the NCAA I-AA mark in 1986 while 
playing for Northern Arizona. Lingmerth made 8 of 8 attempts against Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Penaflor is a hotel restaurant management major at Northern Arizona.

<P>
World Series mania might be over until next season but some fans are taking 
their enthusiasm into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
William K. Alley, president of Hartland Plastics in Hartland, Wis., says there 
has been a "tremendous rash of orders" for the company's 25th anniversary 
series of statues of such immortals as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Ted 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is behind in the initial orders," he said. "We're playing 
catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
Alley, an attorney who has "two kids at the baseball age," bought the company 1 
1/2 years ago as "a fun thing." 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to rejuvenate the craftsmanship-workmanship aspect of this," he 
said. "The company has about 20 workers who hand-make, hand-paint and 
hand-assemble about 500 statues a day -- an exact reproduction under the 
direction of Frank Fulop, the original designer." 
</P>
<P>
It was their quality that set the 7- to 8-inch-tall originals apart from most 
memorabilia of the '50s and early '60s.

Hartland Plastics, a contract manufacturer for other companies, added the 
baseball player statues as a product line, at Fulop's suggestion, to fill in 
slack periods between job orders. The firm hired local sculptors to go to 
Milwaukee Braves games to sketch players who had signed royalty deals with 
Hartland. Not surprisingly, the first players cast were Eddie Mathews, Henry 
Aaron and Warren Spahn. 
</P>
<P>
Hartland's original statues -- made from 1958 to 1963 -- are favorites among 
collectors of baseball memorabilia. They merit two classified column headings 
in Sports Collectors Digest, the enthusiasts' bible. 
</P>
<P>
In one ad, $165 is asked for a Mathews statue, in another, a Nellie Fox with 
the original box is priced at $395. A mint-condition Dick Groat, which had a 
run of only about 5,000 statues, can bring $500 or more. The 18 players in the 
series originally sold for $3.95 to $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
The company abandoned its line of figurines in 1963, switching to makeup 
compact cases for a cosmetics firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lemke, the publisher of Sports Collectors Digest, is one serious collector 
who is happy that the firm is making the reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
"The original statues are priced out of the range of most collectors," he said. 
"This is the next-best thing. It will have no effect on the market for the old 
ones. If anything, it increases the interest in the originals. Those who can 
afford to buy the originals will do so. Those who can't will be able to buy the 
new ones." 
</P>
<P>
Max Himmelstein, owner of a baseball memorabilia shop in Tarzana that trades in 
the originals, agreed that the replicas won't hurt the market for the older 
statues. 
</P>
<P>
"Topps baseball cards reissued their set of '52 cards and it didn't affect the 
price of those," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has seen the first reissued statue, Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked real nice, well-made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new statues have a pencil-eraser-sized stamp on the back, just below the 
players' belts, marking the 25th anniversary. The plastic is whiter than the 
originals and Alley said he has gotten some phone calls on that. 
</P>
<P>
Alley was more worried about calls from irate collectors, but he has received 
only a "few complaints, and about 700 positive letters." 
</P>
<P>
The letters were a nice boost to Alley, who wasn't sure whether the limited 
offering of 10,000 copies of each statue at $23.75 would fly. 
</P>
<P>
Now, says Alley: "Please don't print our address -- we're swamped."

REAL ESTATE EXPERT SEES WAYS TO BUILD LOWER-COST HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from Omaha to Laguna Beach, where he has made his home for 14 
years on the waterfront, but like many of his contemporaries, Michael L. Meyer 
fled the harsh climate of his birthplace for temperate Southern California in 
the early 1960s and found Orange County to be the perfect place to enjoy the 
sun and sea. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, a certified public accountant with a degree from the University of Iowa, 
opened the Newport Beach office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in 1974. He has 
headed the accounting and consulting firm's county operation ever since, 
guiding its growth from a dozen to 155 employees and developing it into a 
respected specialist in real estate and financial industry services. 
</P>
<P>
In his role as a real estate and finance specialist in the county, Meyer has 
for several years lobbied within the industry for a greater commitment to 
lower-cost housing, citing both the potential financial rewards and the need 
for a mix of housing prices to help keep the region's economy healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, 50, writes a regular column for Southern California Builder, a regional 
journal for the construction trades and has also written for the National Real 
Estate Investor and California Builder. He has spoken on regional housing 
issues at many meetings and seminars, including the USC Real Estate Conference 
and the Pacific Coast Builders Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Times staff writer John O'Dell, Meyer discussed 
lower-cost housing in the county and the programs being considered in 
Washington to assist first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Why are you concerned about lower-cost housing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, our concern comes in working with the home builders and land 
developers and commercial and industrial developers in the county. And their 
concern is to be able to provide a product that is affordable to the people who 
are their customers and to try to create a balance of housing and jobs. Among 
other things, the more of a balance you can create, the fewer the social and 
transportation problems that are created. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We've all watched -- some with horror and some with glee -- the price of 
housing in the county increase dramatically in the last few years. The latest 
median price figures have homes in the county running from $230,000 for resale 
single-family homes to $293,500 for new detached homes, and just 16% of the 
families that live here can qualify to buy the median-priced resale home. Does 
all this mean that affordable housing is a pipe dream? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, of course, it depends what you define as affordable. I think we're 
reaching a point where the single-family detached home with a nice-size yard, a 
living room, den, a couple of fireplaces and three bedrooms and three bathrooms 
is not affordable to the median-income family. But you have to keep in mind 
that these affordability indexes have a tendency to exaggerate the problem. 
First of all, you're talking about median income, so half the homes are priced 
lower than that. And when the statistics are about single-family detached, then 
that's really only about a third of the housing stock that's available. And the 
Realtors who report sales from Orange County almost all are from the southern 
and coastal areas -- the higher-priced areas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In all the talk about affordable housing, is there any generally agreed-upon 
figure, for income or for price, as to what is meant by "affordable?" 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, there is no generally agreed figure, but the (county's) median 
household income is something like $45,000 a year. So you could back down from 
that and, presuming the median family has no other sources of income and no 
significant savings, an affordable home would be in the range of $130,000 to 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If we use a $150,000 selling price as a cutoff, is there such a thing as 
affordable housing in the county today? 
</P>
<P>
A. If we use that kind of a guideline, then there's not very much affordable 
housing. And the affordable housing that you do find will be attached -- 
townhouses or condominiums and rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If rentals should be included in discussions of affordable housing, then 
aren't we facing new problems there? Hasn't there been a rather substantial 
change in tax law -- a change that many say is going to kill off the rental 
construction business? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Starting with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the federal government has 
deterred some investment in rental housing across the country because the 
benefits of depreciation write-offs have been diminished and the losses from 
rental operations aren't fully deductible anymore. Also, the tax act greatly 
diminished a tax-exempt bond program, where developers of apartments could get 
lower interest rates and pass them on as lower rents. So, around the country, 
that has created a slowdown in apartment construction. But Orange County was 
one of two markets in the country that had an increase in apartment 
construction in 1987, although construction dropped in 1988 because of higher 
land costs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If financial incentives for building rental units were reduced in '86, why 
did rental construction stay relatively healthy here? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, the activity comes largely from local developers who have seen the 
demand for rental units rise as the price of housing has escalated. The spread 
between the cost of renting and the cost of homeownership has widened, and the 
general feeling has been that even though there's not a very good immediate 
return to an owner of an apartment building, the rents will steadily increase 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And keep on spiraling until we end up with unaffordable apartments as well? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, yeah. There will be a tendency toward the more affordable apartments 
being the older apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said your interest is in representing builders and developers who are 
concerned about having a salable product. Commercial and industrial developers 
are not building housing, so what is their concern? Is it the availability of a 
labor force that can afford to live here? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's one of the concerns. It's a big problem. Both the immediate 
availability of the lower-income type workers and the costs of relocating 
higher-income workers to the county -- where housing prices are higher than 
they were paying -- are major concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And where does that lead us? 
</P>
<P>
A. As with the cost of land for housing, the cost of land for industrial and 
commercial uses has moved up. So we won't have very many more warehouses or 
factories built in Orange County. Instead, what we'll have are research and 
development companies, a lot of medical research facilities and more upgraded 
office buildings -- the types of uses that call upon the pool of higher-income 
people more than the lower-income people. So it does have a tendency to balance 
itself out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You have called repeatedly for Congress to take actions to spur construction 
of lower-cost housing. What is going on in Washington on that front? 
</P>
<P>
A. There is a Senate housing subcommittee that has been holding hearings on a 
National Affordable Housing Act. That's been headed by (Sens.) Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). One of the biggest problems across 
the country is that lower-income people have trouble raising money for a down 
payment. So one part of the proposal is to allow them to borrow from their IRA 
accounts to get a down payment. Another (proposal) raises the Federal Housing 
Administration limit for mortgage insurance, to allow people to get bigger 
loans with lower down payments. The act would also provide funds for a program 
for state and local governments to encourage private-public partnerships in 
affordable housing construction and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Builders tend to be free-market advocates, so turning to government to 
provide lower-cost housing hasn't been met with much enthusiasm. What is the 
difference between programs in the past and what's being talked about now? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I think there are certain things the government does have a proper 
role in. Few people would argue that providing the basic infrastructure -- the 
interstate highway system -- was not an appropriate role for the federal 
government. Government also should be involved in developing schools and 
providing clean water and sewage facilities and just keeping America's 
infrastructure developed and maintained. Other areas, like tax-exempt bonds, or 
even taxable bonds issued by governmental agencies, are a means of providing 
lower-interest-rate financing, and of limiting the mortgages that are provided 
to the lower-income families. So that is a good role for government in the 
housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In other words, providing or finding ways of obtaining lower-cost financing 
is appropriate for government, but not actually building and regulating who can 
rent and sell and buy? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. When the government gets involved in the details of either building or 
controlling the building, then everything goes afoul. But some sort of a 
partnership of local governments, developers, employers, and the general 
populace, with leadership and incentives from the federal government -- that 
makes sense. And in Orange County, the major employers hopefully will start to 
take more interest in the issue of providing housing their workers can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does that mean nothing is happening along that line now? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. But it is being talked about more. The large employers in the county 
are taking more interest in all of the problems of the county, which includes 
the transportation problems and the housing and social-welfare issues. And you 
know there is a tremendous amount that a coalition of employers together with 
developers and environmental agencies and other interest groups could do if 
they put their minds to it. The 1986 tax act brought in tax credits against 
your federal income tax if you invest in affordable housing. And that program 
makes a lot of sense, but it was very slow to be accepted because of the 
complex rules for claiming the credits. But now, some of the large investment 
bankers are syndicating the credits to enable individuals and corporations to 
buy shares. Builders would get the proceeds and do joint ventures with the 
syndications to build apartment projects that are affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do we have any of that development going on in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's not very prevalent. But we've been talking with a lot of our clients 
about going into that program. The clients we've talked to are corporations. 
None have moved into the program, but some are looking into the opportunities 
to combine funding from the tax credit program, with assistance from local 
redevelopment agencies. It is just not profitable in Orange County to build 
moderate-income apartments without assistance. I can't identify any of the 
clients we've talked to because of our confidentiality agreements, but what is 
being explored is acquiring less desireable land at reasonable prices in 
redevelopment areas and then building apartment units that could be rented by 
moderate-income families. They are looking to the redevelopment agencies to 
either write down the cost of the land or to assist by putting in streets and 
other site developments. That, with the added funds from the tax-credit 
syndications, would make these projects viable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Anything else that you see on the horizon to spur construction of lower-cost 
housing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think we will see more taxable bond issues by municipalities. And we may 
see some nonprofit organizations being put together in the county to issue 
bonds to finance housing on a limited scale. State law also requires 20% of the 
tax-increment funds captured by redevelopment agencies to be used for 
affordable housing. But other than that, the help we're seeing from local 
government is more indirect. Transportation improvements like the widening of 
the 55 (Costa Mesa) Freeway. And transportation corridors. The San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor is one that will be funded largely by builder 
fees, with tolls and federal and state funds helping out. All of that just 
starts to take a burden off of the home buyer, and helps out in providing these 
necessary services. The other thing is that those roads are making areas more 
accessible, and that provides people an opportunity to live in a more 
affordable house and still be able to get to work. So all of the improvements 
that go into making this a county where people can move around and be educated 
and have a good life style and are paid for by somebody other than the 
homeowner helps the home builder make a more affordable house. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Much of the available raw land in the county is held in relatively few 
hands. Does that have anything to do with costs? Do landowners now phase land 
sales over time to keep prices up? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I think that having the large land developers in the county has 
resulted in beautiful, planned communities with all kinds of nice amenities. 
And that planning process has developed communities that are so much above the 
standard communities in America that it has driven the prices up in those 
communities. But the landowners and developers are not holding land off the 
market to try to drive the price up. Believe me, they try as hard as they can 
to get the land approved and processed and developed. And they, above everyone 
else, would prefer to see the problems of having an inadequate supply of 
housing solved. They're concerned about the balance of the cost of housing -- 
versus what's affordable to the workers -- just as much as the community is 
concerned about it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is true that a big part of the reason the cost of building a house 
has gone up so much over the years is the cost of land. And the reason land has 
gone up so much is because of the shrinkage of the supply of land. A lot of the 
shrinkage is because of requirements for open space by governmental 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
And the cost of getting government approval to build has stretched out over the 
years, so a developer or a landowner has significant costs just to hold onto 
his land and plan it out. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the cost of the public facilities. The costs of schools, 
streets, sewers, parks all have been passed onto the developers, when the costs 
previously were paid for by the general community through the property tax 
system. All of that adds on to the costs of building and ends up increasing the 
cost of a house. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much do government costs add to the price of a home? 
</P>
<P>
A. A 1987 survey by the Building Industry Assn. showed that the average costs 
in Orange County were $7,500. But it ran much higher in some areas. San Juan 
Capistrano was highest, with government-required fees and land dedications 
adding $21,000 to the cost of each new home. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But builders just pass on the costs, and so far there has not seemed to be a 
lack of buyers. So what is the builders' concern? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think they're concerned about pricing themselves out of being a 
viable community. But the proven formula of having a nice balance is a lot more 
comfortable than projecting out what the development of the county will be if 
every house is $500,000. The question is always just how many people are there 
that can afford a $500,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where is that money coming from? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nobody can do a sophisticated analysis. But people obviously have a lot of 
built-in equity in their existing house and in other properties. And there are 
second- and third-generation people here that have had savings over the years. 
And the economy's been good, so jobs are paying fairly well. And people are 
optimistic about their future ability to pay off their debt. So they come 
through with the money to buy the houses. 
</P>
<P>
But it's speculative to guess how much further that could go. I believe that 
we'll be seeing a more urban type of development here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Multistory apartments and condos? 
</P>
<P>
A. In most urban areas, like New York or San Francisco, and more and more so in 
Los Angeles, the chosen life style for the up-and-coming young executives, 
secretaries and newlyweds is to live in a rental house near the places where 
they work and shop. Retired people and empty-nesters have the tendency to live 
in that type of environment too. It's only when they start to raise a family, 
after they've been working for some years and saved some money, that urban 
people move out into the suburban areas to buy a house. And then, as they make 
their way through life and can afford to move up into a more upscale house, 
they do that. And I think we'll just see more of a trend toward Orange County 
developing into that type of highly desirable urban area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How optimistic are you that we are really going to see more efforts to 
provide more lower-cost housing in the county in the next decade than in the 
past? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, the optimism is only that we'll continue to see higher-density 
developments, smaller houses, smaller rental units, or higher-density projects 
in terms of high-rise or mid-rise construction. We'll also see redevelopment of 
the older mixed-use downtown areas. Orange County is getting older, and now 
that we have some of these 20-, 30- and 40-year-old sites, we'll see some of 
them redeveloped as urban villages, with retail and commercial and decent and 
more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We've also got a lot of 20- and 30-year-old residential tracts in the 
central and northern cities. Is there talk of redevelopment in those areas? 
</P>
<P>
A. Individual houses are remodeled and upgraded over a period of time, some 
with the help of government programs. But to think of a developer compiling 100 
houses to tear down and redevelop into a new housing tract, that's just too 
prohibitive. But there will be rezoning of single-family property to 
multifamily. And developers will buy six or eight houses and build a 
three-story apartment on the property. That type of ongoing upgrading of an 
older neighborhood to what's now considered a better use will continue to 
happen.

JONES MAKES PLAYOFF A BIG PAYOFF IN HOPE

<P>
Steve Jones said he was ready to go home to Phoenix after shooting a 76 in the 
first round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
But he stayed, made the cut, and surprisingly won the tournament Sunday on the 
first hole of a sudden-death playoff with Paul Azinger and Sandy Lyle at 
Bermuda Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
Jones owns the PGA Tour at this early juncture of the year, having also won the 
Tournament of Champions last week at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third tour victory for the 30-year-old pro from Phoenix. He had 
won the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach pro-am last year in a playoff against Bob Tway. 
</P>
<P>
Jones received a first-place check of $180,000, to go along with his payoff of 
$135,000 at La Costa, by making a 4-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole, 
No. 14, a par 4 of 385 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger had a 1-stroke lead over Jones, a playing partner, and Lyle, who had 
already finished, going to the 18th hole, a par-5, 513-yard layout. 
</P>
<P>
But Azinger, who had apparently taken command of the tournament with a birdie 
at the 15th hole, missed a 6-foot putt for a bogey to force a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the putt exactly where I wanted to, in the right center of the hole," 
Azinger said. "And it was in with about a foot to go. Then, it leaked on me and 
I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would make a bogey." 
</P>
<P>
Jones just missed a birdie putt on 18, but easily saved his par. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that Lyle was in the playoff, or that there would be three of 
us," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
On the playoff hole, Azinger hit a driver into the left rough followed by a 
pitching wedge that carried to within 18 feet of the hole, where he 2-putted. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle drove into the right rough and his second shot was about 30 feet from the 
hole. Like Azinger, he 2-putted. 
</P>
<P>
Jones hit a 1-iron off the tee and then skillfully used his 7-iron to draw the 
ball to within 4 feet of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I shook it in there," Jones said of his putt. "I don't know how it went in." 
</P>
<P>
Jones seemed slightly dazed by his victories, the first time someone has swept 
the first two tournaments since 1983 when Gil Morgan won the Tucson and Los 
Angeles Opens. 
</P>
<P>
"It was thrilling," he said. "I couldn't believe it after the way I started." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his 76 on PGA West Wednesday when he was 5 over par after 
16 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jones said he has not played well here. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only made the cut here once in 5 times. No, make it 2 times now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones qualified for his tour card in 1982, but because of an injury, he didn't 
distinguish himself and had to re-qualify at the start of the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot 4-inch, 185-pound former all-state high school basketball player from 
Yuma, Colo., Jones said he didn't believe that he was ready for such an 
auspicious start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd only won 1 tournament in 5 years. Then, boom, boom I've won 2," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, Lyle and Azinger finished regulation play at 343, 17 under par. They 
each shot a 69 on the final day of the 90-hole tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, after shooting a course-record 63 at Eldorado Saturday, was 2 strokes 
behind Mark Calcavecchia, the fourth-day leader, at the outset of Sunday's 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who played with Jones and Azinger, had a 1 stroke lead over the 
field after 12 holes. However, he bogeyed the par-5, 564-yard 13th hole. 
Azinger and Jones got birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger then became the 1-stroke leader at 17 under par and improved his lead 
to 2 strokes over several contenders with a birdie at the par-4, 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Jones closed to within one stroke of Azinger with a 20-foot chip shot for a 
birdie on the par-3, 212-yard 17th hole. He was emulating Calcavecchia, who 
made his birdie chip shot of about 17 feet a few minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia was 2 strokes behind Azinger before the 18th hole. And he had a 
chance to get into a playoff, but he missed a 6-foot birdie putt as Jones 
parred the hole and Azinger bogeyed it. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger's approach shot on No. 18 was his undoing. He skulled his wedge, his 
third shot, and was about 50 feet from the pin. Then he three-putted, seemingly 
shocked that that the ball didn't drop from 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm disappointed," Azinger said. "After not playing well last week 
at La Costa, I wasn't confident this week until today. I played well today, but 
I made a mistake that I shouldn't have made. I should have won." 
</P>
<P>
Lanny Wadkins, playing ahead of Jones, Azinger and Calcavecchia, probably was 
also muttering about what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
He was 2 strokes behind Azinger, when he lined up an eagle putt of about 50 
feet on the 18th hole. He was short of the hole by 3 feet and then missed his 
birdie try. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, a birdie putt would have put him in the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins finished at 344 along with Kenny Knox, Fred Couples and Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
As for Jones, he's heading to his hometown for the Phoenix Open next week. 
Three in a row? Not likely. But neither was two straight.

LAKERS FINALLY LOOK AT HOME ON THE 'ROAD'; 
</P>
<P>
THEY END LOSING STREAK BY BEATING CLIPPERS, 116-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There might as well have been a giant magnifying glass over the Sports Arena 
Sunday afternoon, for all the microscopic analysis that was going on during the 
Lakers' 116-95 victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the people-watching, matinee style, the focus of attention from the crowd 
of the 15,352 belonged to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his 2-week evaluation period to remain the Laker 
starting center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gene Shue and his daily evaluation period to remain as Clipper coach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streaks, on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
As for the latter, the Lakers (24-12) won on the road for the first time after 
8 straight defeats, a skid that had dragged out since Dec. 13. Meanwhile, the 
Clippers (10-26) suffered their ninth consecutive loss and 20th in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar was hardly the key, but his second-half play inside, when the 
Lakers turned a modest 65-57 halftime lead into an eventual 22-point cushion, 
was another bright spot for Laker Coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The much-scrutinized center, who came in averaging 9.4 points and 4.1 rebounds, 
finished at 12 and 5, respectively, while tying his season-high in minutes 
played, 31. He scored 10 of the points, on 5-of-10 shooting, and got all 5 
rebounds in his 18 second-half minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better now," Abdul-Jabbar said of his shooting touch. "I feel my 
shots will go in. Before, they just flew out of my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play the minutes, physically. Mentally, I think I've come up a step or 
two and I think I've been improving. I just haven't been used to being part of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to come back exactly when I (get the minutes). But I think I'm 
approaching it. Another game or so and I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Which is more than can be said for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
With Shue's job possibly hanging in the balance -- even though team owner 
Donald T. Sterling was out of town and president Alan Rothenberg was at home 
ill -- the Clippers played well enough in the first half before the Lakers made 
it a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Clippers played well above their recent standards in the first 
half, shooting 60.5% from the field, to trail by eight points. That they were 
falling behind, though playing good, said plenty about how the Lakers looked. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we were playing against the world champions," said Clipper guard 
Quintin Dailey, who scored 20 of his team-high 24 points in the first half. "We 
turned the ball over in key situations. And when you do that against the 
Lakers, they're off to the races." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shue, who may have coached his last game at the Sports Arena with the 
Clippers: "I thought the Lakers played great. In the first half, we played 
very, very well. As a matter of fact, I don't think we could play much better." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker lead increased steadily in the second half, to 20 points, then to 21 
and, finally, to 22, at 115-93, on Mark McNamara's layin with 48 seconds to 
play. Along the way, the Clippers had only 35 rebounds, a season low and an 
abysmal number by any standard. The Lakers had 53. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin had 13 rebounds and 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting. It was his 
fourth straight game of double-figure rebounds, and he is also averaging 16.8 
points in the last 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm getting back to the way I'm capable of playing," said Benjamin, 
who, for a change, is not one of the subjects under the microscope. "I was 
getting shifted around (between being a starter and a reserve), but now I'm 
coming back to where I was before being benched." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers looked like the Lakers of old on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was their second straight impressive performance. Last Friday in 
the Forum, they defeated Cleveland, the team with the National Basketball 
Assn.'s best record, 116-95. 
</P>
<P>
Five players scored in double figures against the Clippers, led by Byron 
Scott's 28 points, Magic Johnson's 22 (and 12 assists) and James Worthy's 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard Gary Grant missed his second straight game with a bruised right 
thigh. His status for Tuesday's game at Seattle is uncertain. . . . Tom 
Garrick, who has seen time at point guard with Grant's injury and inconsistent 
play, sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. X-rays 
will be taken today as a precautionary move, but his availability for the game 
against the SuperSonics is also unknown. . . . After a career high in points 
(35) and rebounds (20) in Friday's loss to Golden State, Clipper forward Ken 
Norman set another career best against the Lakers with 7 assists. . . . Laker 
Mychal Thompson, on this "road" game: "It was rough. There was adversity. I was 
hitting every light coming here. I couldn't believe it. A couple of police cars 
came flashing by, and I don't know what. . . . The scariest part is that I've 
got to drive back."

RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
MI PREFERIDO SURVIVES LONG STRETCH RUN TO WIN BY A HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $228,200 San Fernando, Santa Anita's first major race of the season, was 
such an enigma that six Daily Racing Form handicappers made their selections 
and none of them picked the same horse. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a starter in the 12-horse field that didn't have a hole in his 
record, and Mi Preferido actually had two. He had broken poorly in his last two 
starts and he didn't have the look of a horse who could win at 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But Mi Preferido broke smartly Sunday, took the early lead while not being 
pushed for the first half-mile and then outran Speedratic in a long stretch 
drive to win by a head before 37,115 fans. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-horse race wound up a two-horse race. Perceive Arrogance nosed out Claim 
to take third, 4 1/2 lengths behind the winner. Perceive Arrogance is trained 
by Albert Barrera, the son of Mi Preferido's trainer, Laz Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
Oraibi, who won the Malibu Dec. 26 and the only San Fernando starter with a 
victory in his last race, ran just behind Mi Preferido for a half-mile before 
struggling home in 11th place. 
</P>
<P>
Mi Preferido, ridden by Chris McCarron, was the second choice behind the 4-1 
Perceive Arrogance and paid $10.20, $6.60 and $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
Speedratic, under Gary Stevens, paid $9.20 and $7 and Perceive Arrogance, 
ridden by Jose Santos, returned $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
The older Barrera has always been high on Mi Preferido, once saying that he was 
his best Triple Crown horse since Affirmed, who swept the series in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But Mi Preferido came out of last year's Santa Anita Derby with a sore back and 
the condition worsened after the Arkansas Derby, forcing him to miss the Triple 
Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
Mi Preferido was third in the Santa Anita Derby and fifth in Arkansas, and 
hadn't won in almost 7 months when he captured the Yankee Valor Handicap at 
Santa Anita in October. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the horse became a gate problem. He didn't break sharply in the 
Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood Park, finishing fifth as Speedratic won the 
stake. Then the ground broke out from under Mi Preferido in the Malibu, and 
still he ran fourth, only a length behind Oraibi. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera described the bad habit Mi Preferido had developed in the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked to relax against the back of the gate," the trainer said. "Today we 
had the man (the assistant starter) keep his head in front." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mi Preferido broke from the No. 1 stall, McCarron felt that the rest 
of the field was loaded quicker Sunday than it was in the Malibu. Mi Preferido 
broke from the No. 2 hole in a 13-horse field the last time. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Malibu, he was in there over a minute and he fell asleep," McCarron 
said. "Today I moved him around while we waited for the others and he came out 
like a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Mi Preferido, carrying 123 pounds, three more than Speedratic, was timed in 
1:47 2/5, which was three-fifths of a second slower than the stakes record. He 
earned $138,200, giving the son of Island Whirl and Exacting Lady a total of 
$582,875 for Barrera and the horse's co-owner, Amin Saiden. 
</P>
<P>
Speedratic, after breaking slowly, might have briefly nosed ahead of Mi 
Preferido at the head of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither Chris nor me asked our horses to run until the eighth pole," Stevens 
said. "My horse settled nice, ran a big race and showed that he can go this 
far." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mitchell, who trains Speedratic, would like to try his colt at 1 1/4 miles 
in the $500,000 Strub Feb. 5. Mi Preferido will also be there, along with 
Cherokee Colony, a solid winner Saturday in the San Carlos Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no complaints," Mitchell said of Speedratic's race Sunday. "I've very 
happy with the way he ran." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron was confident through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of horse left," he said. "And my horse responded. I'm glad there 
was nobody running on the outside of Speedratic, because I felt that my horse 
could out-finish him. But Speedratic ran a great race. I didn't think he'd go 
that far." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Malibu, Barrera had been standing Mi Preferido in the gate during the 
mornings, trying to get him to break better. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse might run all day," said Barrera, who also trained Island Whirl. 
"His sire had no trouble going a mile and a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera won the San Fernando for the first time since he won the stake with 
It's the One in 1982 and Wavering Monarch in 1983. . . . Trainers Gary Jones 
and Brian Mayberry saddled two winners apiece Sunday. . . . Chris McCarron, who 
led the country in major stakes victories with 17 last year, notched his first 
of the year with Mi Preferido. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Neil Drysdale, who has won with 6 of 12 starters at the meet, tries to 
beat heavily favored Very Subtle today with Miss Brio in the Santa Monica 
Handicap. . . . McCarron will take three days off, returning to ride next 
Saturday. . . . Trainer Charles Pinnell was fined $500 by the stewards after 
his horse, True Enough, raced with procaine, an illegal medication. Procaine, 
which is contained in antibiotics, can act as a stimulant when administered 
independently. True Enough was disqualified from his second-place finish in a 
race Dec. 31. Earlier in the meeting, the stewards fined trainer Paul Kooba 
$500 after his horse raced with an illegal analgesic in a race at Hollywood 
Park on Dec. 18. The horse, Love Dan's Getaway, won the race and was 
disqualified.

MORNING BRIEFING: EVERYONE LIKES SAM . . . FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new sign near the Cincinnati Bengals' training facility which reads: 
"Super Team, Super Sam, Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Cincinnati fans were making other signs in reference to Coach Sam 
Wyche when the Bengals went 4-11 and lost several close games in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Boomer Esiason, not always a Wyche booster himself, knows things 
could change if things don't go right in the Super Bowl Sunday against the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year they wanted him fired," Esiason said. "This year everybody wants to 
hire him. Last year he was 'Wicky Wacky,' and this year he's a genius. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can win this one and do the no-huddle offense, he'll be the greatest of 
all time. He'll be better than Vince Lombardi. If we lose it, it's 'Well, they 
did too many gimmicks again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Bob: Wrote Norman Chad of The Washington Post about Bud Bowl I: 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Costas once was a budding sportscaster; now he is a sporting Budcaster. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC-TV Budcaster Bob Costas. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? And Costas, by 
gladly joining in Anheuser-Busch's megalomaniacal, mind-numbing Bud Bowl I 
promotion, not only cheapens his journalistic reputation but also risks being a 
handmaiden to the most cynical instincts of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob, for all you do for Anheuser-Busch, this Bud's for you." 
</P>
<P>
Secondhand dimension: Before anybody thinks some Coca-Cola executive came up 
with a sudden brainstorm to have the Super Bowl halftime show televised in 3-D, 
Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun reports that the 3-D glasses were originally 
scheduled for a "Moonlighting" episode that was canceled by the writers' strike 
and were recycled for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Cats: The Columbus (Ga.) Astros, Houston's double-A Southern League farm team, 
have changed their name to the Columbus Mudcats. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team's new ownership, under principal owner Steve Bryant of 
Raleigh, N.C., thought the club needed a name "more in keeping with the area." 
</P>
<P>
A mudcat is a catfish that lives in muddy water -- such as the Chattahoochee 
River, which flows past Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Cats II: Some teams use a 2-3 zone to contain an opponent's big men, but Jess 
Hutson of the Thiel College Tomcats may be the only coach in college basketball 
whose playbook contains the 2-2 defense. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries, fouls and academic problems have forced the Tomcats (1-9) to finish 
their last two games with four players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dressing seven players, but five of them were injured," Hutson 
said. "Our kids get clearance from the doctor to play a game, then go back on 
their crutches until we have another game."

SEATTLE'S ELLIS SAYS ARREST MAY STRENGTHEN MARRIAGE

Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics says his marriage may become stronger as 
the result of his arrest in a domestic dispute last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was blown out of proportion," Ellis told the Seattle Times. 
"That's what happens when you're in the public eye. You're under a microscope. 
You have to do the right thing all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sad thing about it. I don't really want to discuss what happened. 
It's kind of personal. A little embarrassing. But you know, you argue the most 
with people you love the most." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, 28, and his wife, Monique, have a 2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was booked into the King County Jail on charges of simple assault, 
resisting arrest and having an outstanding warrant for driving without a 
license. He was released after Seattle president Bob Whitsitt posted $1,800 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that everything happens for a reason," Ellis said. "I think this 
incident was a sign that there is something in my life that I need to change, 
to re-evaluate. Now, I'm searching for what that is. Maybe it's something I'm 
not doing right. My wife and I have talked about it. Maybe this will make our 
relationship better. We'll start treating each other better."

Trond Arne Bredesen of Norway took the lead in the overall Nordic Combined 
World Cup standings by winning the season's fourth event that was completed 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bredesen, 21, led after Saturday's ski jumping portion and stayed ahead of the 
field despite having only the 11th-fastest time in Sunday's 15-kilometer cross 
country race. 
</P>
<P>
The third World Cup victory of his career pushed Bredesen to the top of World 
Cup standings with 59 points. 
</P>
<P>
Hippolyt Kempf of Switzerland, the Olympic champion, was favored to win the 
two-day event after finishing a solid sixth in the ski jumping portion. But the 
Swiss managed only the ninth place in the race, usually his stronger event, and 
had to settle for second place. 
</P>
<P>
Kempf also trailed Bredesen in overall World Cup standings with 55 points.

PITTSBURGH BEATS ANOTHER RANKED TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Pittsburgh should play only highly-ranked teams and not schedule weak 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers lost earlier this season to Siena and Duquesne and had lost 3 of 
their last 4 games before surprising the third-ranked Sooners, 99-91, Sunday at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Shorter scored 37 points and had 12 rebounds, and Rod Brookin had 24 
points as the Panthers overcame Mookie Blaylock's 37-point performance. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma (13-2) had won 11 straight, and the loss was the first for the Sooners 
in the 12 games they have scored 90 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's only victories in its last 5 games have been against then-No. 2 
Syracuse and Oklahoma, which hadn't lost since the second game of the season to 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter, a 6-foot 6-inch sophomore, had 22 points in the first half as the 
Panthers used a 9-point run -- aided by a technical foul on Sooner Coach Billy 
Tubbs -- to take a 55-49 halftime lead. Pittsburgh was defeated, 76-57, by No. 
7 Georgetown last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brookin scored 11 second-half points as the Panthers (8-6) never let the 
Sooners get any closer than 5 points after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, averaging 110.5 points a game, trailed by as many as 12, but closed 
to within 86-81 on Herman Henry's tap-in with a little less than 5 minutes 
left. But the Panthers scored 7 straight points -- 4 by Brookin and 3 by 
Shorter -- for a 93-81 lead with 2:30 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 106, North Carolina 83 -- Senior guard Richard Morgan scored a 
career-high 39 points and the Cavaliers broke a 5-game losing streak by routing 
the No. 8 Tar Heels in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Charlottesville, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (14-3 overall, 1-1 in the ACC) had won 6 straight games against 
Virginia (8-6, 1-2) and 13 of the last 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels played the last 5:23 without Jeff Lebo, who was leading North 
Carolina with 26 points when he twisted his left ankle and had to leave the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 67, Georgia Tech 65 -- Kenny Payne made 2 3-point baskets in the 
final 77 seconds to lift the No. 9 Cardinals past the No. 19 Yellow Jackets at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's first 3-pointer, with 1:17 to play, gave the Cardinals a 63-62 lead. 
His second, with 44 seconds left, built a 66-64 advantage. Pervis Ellison, who 
scored 20 points, made a free throw with 4 seconds left as Louisville (12-2) 
extended its winning streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Oliver missed a 40-foot shot at the buzzer for Georgia Tech (10-4). 
Oliver had a chance to tie the score with 5 seconds left, but he missed 1 of 2 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 101, Tennessee 90 -- Tony Dawson scored 30 points and George 
McCloud had 29 as the No. 14 Seminoles easily defeated the No. 17 Volunteers at 
Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (12-1) opened a 50-28 lead late in the first half and withstood 
several Tennessee runs in the second half. The Volunteers (11-2) closed to 
within 66-61 with 12:14 left in the game on Dyron Nix's 3-point shot, but were 
never able to get any closer. 
</P>
<P>
McCloud scored 5 points on a breakaway dunk and a 3-point shot to cap a 7-point 
run that lifted the Seminoles back into a 73-61 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 82, California 80 -- Todd Lautenbach scored 6 points in the final 
1:17, including the winning basket as time expired, giving the Huskies the 
Pacific 10 victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Lautenbach rebounded a missed shot by teammate Dion Brown and made a 4-footer. 
Just before that shot, the 6-10 reserve center made 2 free throws, then stole a 
pass at midcourt and drove for a layin to give the Huskies (5-8 overall, 2-3 in 
the Pac-10) an 80-78 lead with 1 minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Taylor tied the game, 80-80, with 2 free throws with 45 seconds left. 
Taylor led all scorers with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
California is 12-5 overall and 3-3 in the Pacific 10.

CINCINNATI NOT GETTING CREDIT IT DESERVES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the chief differences so far between this and other recent Super Bowl 
weeks is the widespread lack of support for the American Football Conference 
entry here next Sunday, the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I've read or run into is picking the (San Francisco) 49ers," Dallas 
Cowboys President Tex Schramm said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such unanimity despite the fact that Cincinnati has a better 
shot, in my opinion, than a lot of other (1980s) AFC teams." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the last 4 winters, when quarterbacks such as John Elway and Dan Marino 
appeared to give AFC teams a solid chance, Cincinnati's Boomer Esiason and the 
Bengals' 15th-ranked defense don't seem -- in the view of most observers -- to 
be a match for Joe Montana and the third-ranked 49er defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give you one prediction," Schramm said. "If the 49ers agree (with the 
majority view), they'll lose. This is a game of the mind. Nobody's invincible 
if you think you are. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, first to arrive for the 23rd renewal of the series, began workouts 
Sunday afternoon at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, which will be their 
home away from a freezing home this week. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche, who closed the practice to the public, reported no new 
injuries or illness. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Walsh acknowledged Sunday that he has thought about stepping down as 
49er coach next season, but said he will remain with the team no matter what he 
decides. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to remain with the 49ers, quite possibly in the same capacity," 
Walsh said, shortly after arriving with the team in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"When you coach 30 years, you have to look pretty seriously at your life and 
career. But there are other times when you say, 'I can't give it up. It's what 
I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he would decide soon after the Super Bowl whether to stay as coach 
or move to an executive capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie DeBartolo, the 49er owner, surprised Walsh and team by acting as the 
hotel doorman when they arrived in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize it was him. I didn't have time to tip him," said Walsh, whose 
team will begin practice at the University of Miami today. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Sevier, a San Diego Chargers assistant who coached in this game with the 
Washington Redskins in 1983, is among the football people who reason that it 
was bad luck for Wyche and his no-huddle offense that they drew the 49ers and 
Coach Bill Walsh in Cincinnati's first Super Bowl since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Walsh will have a (defensive) plan for the no-huddle, you can count on that," 
Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, with 225-pound strong safety Jeff Fuller in the San Francisco 
lineup, the 49ers can make a conventional alignment look like the nickel 
defense, or vice versa, Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuller is as solid against the run as he is active against the pass," the San 
Diego coach added. "He's bigger than (49er linebacker) Keena Turner, who lists 
at 222." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller is listed at 216, though his opponents doubt that he was that small 10 
or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"(Against no-huddle formations) a big safety like Fuller is a tremendous asset 
to a team like the 49ers," Sevier said. "I mean, when big (Cincinnati fullback) 
Ickey Woods is running against a little safety in the ordinary nickel, it's a 
mismatch. Fuller changes that dimension. 
</P>
<P>
"It's similar with (San Francisco linebacker) Charles Haley, who can be either 
a down lineman or a linebacker. The no-huddle offense loses a lot of its 
effectiveness against multiple-formation players like Fuller and Haley. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers don't have to worry about bringing in defensive specialists. They're 
already on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Gillman, the Hall of Famer who used to coach the Rams and other National 
Football League teams, is no fan of the no-huddle attack in any case. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a haphazard way to run an offense, with people running around out there 
shouting at other people," Gillman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if it's third and 5, I'm going to send in an extra cornerback, 
anyhow, no-huddle or not." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier, who is a candidate for at least one of the coaching vacancies that have 
materialized in the NFL this winter, expects a relatively penalty-free Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Though the referees throw a lot of flags each fall in the regular season, they 
normally restrain themselves in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
As Sevier sees it, there are three reasons for this: 
</P>
<P>
"First, you get a better quality team in the Super Bowl," he said. "Good teams 
make fewer fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, these are the NFL's best officials of the year. Like Super Bowl 
players, they're at the very top of their game, or they wouldn't be here, and 
they don't want an official's call to be the difference. So they make sure that 
anything they call, they actually see. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials are like the rest of us, and in a hum-drum game in the regular 
season they're more subject to bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Third, Super Bowl officials, being the best at their profession, are less 
likely than other officials to call clipping on a kick return. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the penalty that is most often not a foul. And it comes when blocking 
angles are changed after the kick returner changes direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Returners run to a designated point of attack -- but if the kicking team shuts 
them down there, they're coached to run (elsewhere) to daylight. This sets up 
unforeseen blocking angles. 
</P>
<P>
"What would have been a good block becomes a push in the back -- and the 
official drops his handkerchief. In the regular season, I mean, they do. 
</P>
<P>
"You're less likely to see that in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Browne of the NFL said TV surveys show that 40% of those viewing Super Bowl 
XXIII on home television will be women. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more than double the number of women who usually watch a sports event," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven South Florida taxi drivers, serving on something called the Super Bowl 
'89 Taxi Squad, are acting as role models in Miami this week for other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a Miami Nice campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers were trained in courtesy and other welcome virtues at St. Thomas 
University nearby. Many Dade County taxi drivers are wearing welcome-to-Miami 
Super Bowl hats and shirts funded by a $50,000 grant from a Florida 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the improvements are cosmetic or otherwise, but fares 
in Miami do seem more reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Unless he changes his mind, Alvin Garrett's ring from the 1983 Super Bowl is 
going to the highest bidder. In an auction of sorts, the former Washington 
Redskins wide receiver has taken out a classified ad in The Washington Post in 
hopes of selling the ring, according to a Post story. 
</P>
<P>
The going price is undetermined, although Garrett said Friday $50,000 is a 
nice, round figure. Early callers are stuck at about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That wouldn't be enough," he said. "We're just starting it off. It'll climb." 
</P>
<P>
The ad began running in the Post this week under "Antiques and Collectibles" 
and reads, "COLLECTOR'S ITEM -- 1982 Redskins World Champ Superbowl ring. Very 
valuable &amp; rare oppty." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said he has been unemployed for a month or two and that he needs the 
money. "I thought about this since a long time ago," he said. "I guess you have 
to be me to understand. It's just a ring. When I got it, it was good to have, 
but there's more to life than a gold band and a diamond. . . . You need to have 
enough money to have shelter, a car to drive, food to eat."

STRANGE GAINS 2-STROKE WIN OVER FLOYD

<P>
Curtis Strange overcame blustery winds and agonizingly slow greens for a 
1-over-par 73 Sunday and a 2-stroke victory over Raymond Floyd in the $525,000 
Daikyo Palm Meadows golf tournament at Gold Coast, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, the 1988 U.S. Open champion, finished with a 72-hole total of 
8-under-par 280 and earned $92,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Strange won the nearby Sanctuary Cove tournament and went on to 
become the first player to earn more than $1 million in a year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd shot a 73 for 282 and earned $55,080, and Terry Price had a 74 for 283 
and collected $35,190 -- the biggest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who last year failed in a bid to gain a U.S. Tour players' card, had to 
go through qualifying rounds to get into the tournament, one of the richest on 
the Australian circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The players had difficulty reading the tricky greens because of the windy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Peter Fowler finished fourth at 284 after a final-round 74, while 
Japan's Isao Aoki (75), American qualifier Jeff Maggert (73) and Australian 
George Serhan (72) shared fifth at 285. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds made it difficult for all of us and I found it almost impossible to 
judge my putts," Aoki said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange said a 10-foot par putt at the par-4 10th turned his game around after 
the double bogey at nine.

A gunman surrendered early today to end a six-hour standoff with authorities 
who surrounded his Hermosa Beach home after he fired a gun during an argument 
with his wife, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young children were found asleep and unharmed in a bedroom of the home at 
736 Monterey Blvd. following the surrender of their father, Michael Barnum, 32, 
at 6 a.m., police Cmdr. Anthony Altfeld said. The incident began shortly after 
midnight when police received a call from a neighbor who had heard the gunshot. 
When officers arrived, they saw Barnum standing in his doorway, holding a 
semiautomatic handgun, Altfeld said. The Sheriff's Department sent its Special 
Weapons Team while other officers urged the man to surrender.

Iranian authorities executed 23 people on charges of smuggling narcotics into 
the country, bringing to 47 the number executed on drug charges since Jan. 1, 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency said today. The latest executions 
came amid an intensified campaign against narcotics trafficking, especially 
smugglers hauling opium, heroin and marijuana from across the Pakistani and 
Afghan borders.

Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker moved their television show to a new time slot today 
-- the same time their old PTL show runs -- because their previous, earlier 
hour made it impossible for Tammy's voice to hit high notes. 
</P>
<P>
The "Jim and Tammy Show" returned to the airwaves two weeks ago at 9 a.m. But 
today, it was filmed from their home at 11 a.m. Tammy Faye had told viewers for 
the last two weeks that her diaphragm did not expand the way it should early in 
the morning, making it difficult to inhale enough air to hit the high notes.

"Things are going extremely well," said Unifirst President Tom Scott. "Deposits

President Reagan is likely to act this week on a proposal to lift some 
sanctions against American oil companies doing business in Libya to keep 
Moammar Kadafi from "getting a windfall," an Administration official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the easing of prohibitions on 
the U.S. companies would be designed to prevent them from losing assets in 
Kadafi's North African nation. A delicate agreement between the Libyan leader 
and the companies expires June 30, and he then might seize their assets. 
</P>
<P>
Any Reagan action would be limited and would not apply to the comprehensive 
economic sanctions in trade and other areas that have been in effect since 
1986, the Administration official stressed. Reagan recently signed an executive 
order renewing the restrictions for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to prevent Kadafi from getting a windfall," the official said of the 
oil proposal. "It's not that we're getting soft on Kadafi."

THREE GUERRILLAS GIVEN LONG SENTENCES FOR '86 SOUTH AFRICAN TREASON, TERRORISM

Three African National Congress guerrillas, among them one of the most senior 
ANC leaders tried in 25 years, were sentenced to lengthy prison terms today for 
treason and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year sentence for treason was issued to the most prominent defendant, 
Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, 51, who was abducted from Swaziland in 1986 by men he 
said were South African agents. He has been widely described as the 
highest-ranking ANC official to go on trial since Nelson Mandela and several 
colleagues were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, Mandla Maseko, received a 23-year sentence for treason. The 
other, Simon Dladla, received 12 years for terrorism. They were found guilty of 
laying land mines that injured eight people in Transvaal Province in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gave Salutes 
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim, who is of Indian descent, and his co-defendants, who are black, turned 
toward supporters in the gallery at the Pretoria Supreme Court and gave 
clenched-fist salutes before they were led away. All three could have been 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that after supporters sang an anti-apartheid anthem, 
a government prosecutor was heard saying, "Long live the AWB" -- the Afrikaans 
initials of the white-supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The men were convicted in November after a 16-month trial. At one stage last 
year, three members of the ANC's executive committee -- who faced arrest in 
South Africa -- gave evidence for the defense at a court session held in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim, along with his co-defendants, did not testify during the trial, but he 
submitted a 17-page written statement to the court in which he alleged that all 
three men were tortured by police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Reprehensible' 
</P>
<P>
"Finding us guilty is merely a statement that the state considers the struggle 
for democracy, equality, justice, peace and a non-racial society to be morally 
and politically reprehensible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish to say to our people, we tried to carry out your behests," Ebrahim 
wrote. "We did our best to live up to what you expected of us as members of the 
African National Congress."

National League Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser was one of five Los 
Angeles Dodgers to file for salary arbitration today, the final day players 
were allowed to file. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, 30, signed a one-year contract for $1.1 million last winter, then 
compiled a 23-8 record with a 2.26 earned run average. He set a record by 
finishing the season with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser lost in salary arbitration in 1987, earning $800,000 instead of the 
$1.1 million he sought. He won in 1986, earning $1 million rather than the 
$600,000 the Dodgers offered. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Dodgers to file for arbitration were reserve infielder 
Dave Anderson, backup catcher Rick Dempsey, starting pitcher Tim Leary and 
left-handed reliever Ray Searage.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 
a personal message Sunday that he wants to make an official visit to Britain as 
soon as possible, Thatcher's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Soviet Ambassador Leonid M. Zamyatin, who saw the 
prime minister on his return from a trip to Moscow for a Central Committee 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gorbachev confirmed his desire to pay an official visit to Britain and 
said dates should be agreed as soon as possible," a spokeswoman at Thatcher's

<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher said that Mr. Gorbachev was welcome whenever he chose to come to 
Britain," the spokeswoman added. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had been scheduled to visit Britain a month ago but had to cancel the 
trip at the last minute when an earthquake devastated Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
He cut short his visit to the United States and returned to Moscow, postponing 
visits to Britain and Cuba.

The body was burned beyond recognition and an autopsy was scheduled for this

The fire broke out about 10:30 p.m. inside a two-story, four-unit complex in

Dan Southworth said. It took 35 firefighters 16 minutes to control the fire, 
which destroyed one unit and caused minor damage to another. 
</P>

Placentia detectives were investigating the death, Police Lt. Daryll Thomann 
said. "We hope to rule out homicide or determine it was an accidental death," 
he said.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is expected to take part in a planned 
consortium bid for General Electric Co. PLC of Britain, a respected financial 
daily reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, however, that GEC's defenses against a consortium takeover bid 
was strengthened by its announcement Friday of a merger with the U.S.-based 
General Electric Co. of their European consumer products, medical equipment and 
some electrical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported that AT&amp;T is expected to confirm its 
participation in the dramatic bid for GEC this week following weekend 
negotiations with Lazard Brothers investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times and other newspapers also reported that the British 
electronics firm Plessey Co. PLC made a bid to acquire GPT, an electronics 
company it jointly owns with GEC, citing a broken agreement between the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
GEC, which itself has made a $3-billion bid with West Germany's Siemens AG for 
Plessey, said it will fight to keep its share of GPT, reports in The Guardian 
and Financial Times said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy declined to comment on 
the reports.

The dollar closed sharply higher in light holiday trading today, hitting the 
best level in three months on speculation that Western trading partners are 
tolerating a stronger U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
It jumped to 1.8550 West German marks at the close from Friday's 1.8445, which 
had also been a three-month high. 
</P>
<P>
It also advanced against Japan's currency to 128.00 yen from 127.40. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was slow, however, with banks closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. 
federal holiday. The shortened trading day ended at 1 p.m. EST instead of the 
normal 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the Federal Reserve and commercial banks closed, dealers neither expected 
nor reported any central bank intervention to halt the dollar's rise, as there 
had been on several days last week. But speculators continued to buy.

"There is natural demand for the dollar," said Yani Budiman of Chemical Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar has been buoyed in recent weeks by steady U.S. interest rates and 
stronger economic reports, as well as the perception that the U.S. trading 
partners are allowing it to rise. The Fed may be seeking a stronger currency to 
reduce the threat of inflation from expensive imports, dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, a sharply wider November U.S. trade gap Wednesday could dim the 
dollar's luster, dealers said. Others felt that for technical reasons alone the 
currency could be due for a decline. 
</P>
<P>
"We could reach 1.88 marks by Wednesday," a Frankfurt dealer said. "But it's 
gone up too fast. . . . Next week it might correct four or five pfennigs," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar extended last week's gains on the back of West German 
Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remark Friday that the dollar's present 
level is acceptable. Expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain firm 
also helped. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said current values -- up more than 4.5% against the mark since the 
start of the year -- were acceptable to the Group of Seven industrial powers. 
</P>
<P>
Speculative money has flowed to dollars because high U.S. interest rates offer 
a good return on many dollar assets.

 -- Ford Motor Co. Ltd. said today it plans to switch production of its Sierra 
model from Britain to Belgium as part of its strategy to prepare for the single 
European market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The gradual production switch is expected to cut 500 jobs in Dagenham, 
northeast of London, and create 2,000 jobs in Genk, Belgium, over the next five 
years, said a Ford spokesman. The moves will strengthen the company's ability 
to meet anticipated increases and variations in demand by 1992, when the Common 
Market is to become one barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers, Ford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dagenham, which employs 8,300 auto workers, will concentrate on the new Fiesta 
model, to be introduced in the spring, with production to be increased to match 
the current combined output of Sierras and Fiestas of 1,100 a day.

The Detroit Tigers signed free agent right-handed relief pitcher Frank Williams 
to a contract today. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who will be 31 on Feb. 13, pitched the last two seasons for the 
Cincinnati Reds. In 60 games last year, Williams was 3-2 with a 2.39 earned-run 
average and one save. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers general manager Bill Lajoie said he considers Williams a solid middle 
reliever. Williams was 7-2 in his two seasons with the Reds. Originally signed 
by the San Francicso Giants, Williams will begin the 1989 season with a career 
major league record of 21-11.

GRAF OVERPOWERS HER FOE IN OPENING ROUND

<P>
After losing to defending champion Steffi Graf 6-2, 6-1 in the first round of 
the Australian Open, 16-year-old Kerry-Anne Guse was asked to pick the 
highlight of her match. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning my first game," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Guse was not kidding. After Graf won the first eight points of today's match, 
it seemed like a shutout was a real possibility. After all, the Australian Guse 
was playing in only her second senior tournament while Graf was opening her bid 
for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
It's a common feeling among Graf's opponents. The West German has become so 
dominant that her early-round victims are often grateful to win a few games. 
</P>
<P>
Guse managed to win two straight games after falling behind 3-0 in the first 
set. Then Graf got serious, blasting winners all over center court and 
overpowering her inexperienced foe in 43 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulty for Wilander 
</P>
<P>
The defending men's champion, Mats Wilander, had a more difficult time winning 
his opening-round match. The world's No. 1 player struggled for more than three 
hours before beating Swedish countryman Tobias Svantesson 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 5-7, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not pleased with the way I played, but I'm pleased with the way it 
turned out," Wilander said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who won three of the four Grand Slam events last year, said he 
remained confident even after losing the fourth set. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander has struggled since taking over the No. 1 ranking last September at 
the U.S. Open. He failed to make the semifinals at the Masters, lost to 
Carl-Uwe Steeb in the Davis Cup final against West Germany and was beaten by 
John McEnroe in an exhibition match last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard to Motivate Myself' 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to motivate myself after the U.S. Open," Wilander said. "After 
that final, it didn't seem like anything else mattered very much." 
</P>
<P>
Two seeds were eliminated on opening day. Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden upset No. 6 
Henri Leconte of France 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 and American Elise Burgin ousted No. 11 
women's seed Sylvia Hanika of West Germany 6-3, 6-1.

Catcher Bill Schroeder and outfielder Tony Armas signed one-year contracts with 
the California Angels today. Armas signed for $425,000 -- the same amount he 
earned last year -- after filing for arbitration earlier in the day. He was one 
of seven Angels to file on the final day that players were allowed to do so. 
Schroeder, acquired from the Milwaukee Brewers during the off-season, signed 
for $375,000, a raise of $2,500 over what he earned in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Other Angels to file for arbitration were pitchers Kirk McCaskill and Greg 
Minton, catcher Darrell Miller, third baseman Jack Howell, shortstop Dick 
Schofield and outfielder Chili Davis. First baseman Wally Joyner filed last 
week. Joyner has requested a 1989 salary of $965,000, while the Angels have 
offered $750,000.

HERSHISER, 4 OTHER DODGERS FILE FOR SALARY ARBITRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, whose picture-perfect pitching earned him the World Series MVP 
award, was one of five Dodgers to file for salary arbitration today, the final 
day players were allowed to file. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, 30, signed a one-year contract for $1.1 million last winter, then 
compiled a 23-8 record with a 2.26 earned run average. The Cy Young Award 
winner set a record by finishing the season with 59 consecutive scoreless 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the right-hander was honored as the most valuable player in the 
National League playoffs and World Series as the Dodgers beat the New York Mets 
and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser lost in salary arbitration in 1987, earning $800,000 instead of the 
$1.1 million he sought. He won in 1986, earning $1 million rather than the 
$600,000 the Dodgers offered. 
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Hershiser is seeking a contract to cover more than 
three years. He is eligible to become a free agent after the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Dodgers to file for arbitration were reserve infielder 
Dave Anderson, backup catcher Rick Dempsey, starting pitcher Tim Leary and 
left-handed reliever Ray Searage. 
</P>
<P>
Three players eligible for arbitration -- infielder Mariano Duncan, first 
baseman-outfielder Franklin Stubbs and left-handed reliever Ricky Horton -- 
signed contracts late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Horton, acquired late last season from the Chicago White Sox, signed a one-year 
contract for $580,000, a raise of $47,500.
