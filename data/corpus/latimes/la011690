Baby Boss on the Way: Columbia Records and other sources close to Bruce 
Springsteen confirmed Monday that the rocker's girlfriend/backup singer Patti 
Scialfa is expecting, though no date for the blessed event is known. The couple 
has reportedly been working lately on tracks for Scialfa's solo debut album and 
possibly for a new Springsteen album, but -- as with the baby -- no release 
dates have been announced. At the time of Springsteen's 1988 divorce from 
Julianne Phillips, there was speculation that reluctance on her part to have 
children so that she could concentrate on her acting career precipitated the 
split, but neither party has commented on the matter publicly. SHAUNA SNOW

MORNING REPORT: JANUARY IS A GOOD MONTH FOR 'JULY'

Although there was a general drop in business during the first post-Holiday 
weekend, film industry analysts say January is developing into a strong month 
for movie exhibitors. Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July" held onto its 
No. 1 spot, grossing $8 million, down 25% from the previous weekend's business. 
</P>
<P>
"The War of the Roses" clung to second with a $5.7 million weekend and "Tango 
and Cash," a surprisingly strong performer given its scathing reviews, once 
again finished third, running its 24-day total to $38.6 million. Mike Figgis' 
super-violent "Internal Affairs," about the investigation of a corrupt Los 
Angeles cop, opened well with $5 million at 975 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
* Ed Zwick's Civil War drama, "Glory," expanded from 8 to 392 screens across 
the nation where it averaged a strong $7,653.

Shandling May End Series: Garry Shandling is considering ending his comedy 
series, "It's Garry Shandling's Show," on Showtime and Fox Broadcasting at the 
end of the current season. "It's up in the air right now," said Brad Grey, 
Shandling's manager and executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
"Garry and I are talking about what the plan will be for next year. Garry's 
really trying to sort out whether he wants to continue or move onto something 
new and different." . . . But Fox had some good news to balance that on Monday. 
The debut of its animated series "The Simpsons" was the most popular program in 
its 8:30 p.m. Sunday time period in Los Angeles and finished second overall in 
the 23 markets for which A.C. Nielsen gets overnight ratings, beating ABC and 
NBC. National ratings will be released today. SHAUNA SNOW

NEW PRINCIPALS IN OPERA PACIFIC 'LA TRAVIATA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Opera Pacific production of Verdi's "La Traviata" represents no milestone 
of interpretive insight. However, it makes good traditional sense -- a few 
directorial quirks notwithstanding -- so long as the three central roles are 
well cast. 
</P>
<P>
They were well cast for the opening performance, Saturday night at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. They turned out to be less well cast at the 
Sunday matinee. Such are the vicissitudes in an irrational art that allows 
robust but consumptive heroines to sing strenuous arias on their pathetic 
deathbeds. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the center of attention among the alternate principals was the brave 
young soprano attempting the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Friede, originally scheduled for the assignment, withdrew last week 
either because of ill health (the official company explanation) or because of 
disagreements with the management (the rumor-mill explanation). In her place 
came a little known, would-be diva named Brenda Harris. 
</P>
<P>
She is talented, make no mistake. She is statuesque and pretty. She commands an 
array of sweet and pure tones that can move about a wide range with 
considerable agility. She is a conscientious actress. 
</P>
<P>
She made all the right motions. She even avoided the grotesquerie of painting 
crimson circles on her cheeks in the quasi-mad scene concocted by the local 
director for the last act. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, alas, made her an instant Violetta. For all her professionalism 
and assurance, she did little on Sunday to illuminate the tragedy of the 
courtesan who foreswears love in quest of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Whether dealing with rapture, fear, renunciation, hysteria or agony, she 
produced the same invariably lovely sounds (up to but not including a squeaky 
E-flat unwisely ventured at the end of "Sempre libera"). Ultimately, she gave a 
bland, immature performance more notable for promise than for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
At best, she was a Gilda. This was a girl sent in to do a woman's job. 
</P>
<P>
As Alfredo, Rico Serbo acted with convincing ardor and introduced an unexpected 
bit of motivation for the hero's desperate swagger in the gambling scene: He is 
drunk. Unfortunately, Serbo's dry, nasal, often tremulous tenor tended to 
compromise dramatic compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Poulimenos, the strong and dark-voiced Germont pere, looked chronically 
angry and sounded chronically gruff. Like his colleagues, he paid little 
attention to matters of dynamic subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this "Traviata" followed familiar patterns. Bernard Uzan's staging 
scheme remained perfectly functional despite some cheap effects (an itinerant 
puppy-dog steals the scene in Act III). Mark Flint again conducted with more 
brio than precision, but the orchestra showed signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
Violetta will be undertaken Friday night and Sunday afternoon by a third 
soprano, Nova Thomas, who scored a considerable success here last season as 
Adalgisa opposite the Norma of Joan Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most opera companies in the civilized world, Opera Pacific allows late 
seating and thus spoils much of the first act for those who care enough to 
arrive on time. 
</P>
<P>
The audience on this occasion included one non-bel-canto baby equipped with 
leather lungs. Early cultural education is very nice, but this is ridiculous.

RICK DU BROW: EARTHQUAKE FLASHBACK SHAKES THINGS UP ON 'MIDNIGHT CALLER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

<P>
TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
FLASHBACK: How can a San Francisco-based TV series ignore the October quake 
that struck the city? 
</P>
<P>
Not easily, especially if it's a contemporary drama like NBC's "Midnight 
Caller." 
</P>
<P>
So tonight's the night to tune in -- a little after the fact ("Full House" 
handled the subject last month), but better late than never. 
</P>
<P>
Through the good old flashback device, radio talk-show host Gary Cole, station 
boss Wendy Kilbourne and others recall their experiences the day the earth 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
The twist is a shady Hollywood producer who wants to do a film on the quake, 
but thinks the story isn't good enough by itself and needs a little hype. 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK, the episode's a little gimmicky, not as nitty-gritty as you might 
expect, but irresistible nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
And Kilbourne just gets better and better -- a perfect pairing with Cole. 
They've still got what Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis lost in their 
relationship in "Moonlighting." 
</P>
<P>
INSIDE DOPE: According to "Tonight" show sub Jay Leno, Manuel Noriega has been 
told he can no longer be considered for the CIA's employee-of-the-month award. 
</P>
<P>
MASHED: Alan Alda's decision to bow out of his planned NBC series is a real 
blow to the network, which is still No. 1 but badly in need of new quality 
shows after its disastrous lineup of freshman entries this season. 
</P>
<P>
HOLY SMOKE: And is NBC really serious about doing that Jim and Tammy Bakker TV 
movie, "Fall From Grace"? Let's see -- Bernadette Peters is set to play Tammy. 
So if you follow that line of thinking, then maybe Steve Martin would be great 
as Jim. Or if Steve is not available, how about Bill Murray? I just changed my 
mind. It's a great project. 
</P>
<P>
OLLIEWOOD: So Ollie North addressed the Hollywood Radio and Television Society 
last week. Pure logic. A few weeks before that, he narrated "Peter and the 
Wolf" in Washington. Won raves. Without a shred of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
SAY WHAT?: "No cable. No Magic," says the billboard on Olympic Boulevard, 
implying that you can't see Magic Johnson and the Lakers on TV unless you get 
cable. Well, only if your TV set can't get KCAL Channel 9, which is 
broadcasting 40 Lakers games this season -- at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
CURTAIN CALL: It's time to pack up those Joe Isuzu commercials. They've had it. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANA: Caught that documentary about jeans -- "Design Classics" -- on KCET 
Channel 28 and loved the description of Levi's as "honest" clothing. That says 
it, all right. 
</P>
<P>
BY GEORGE: Some local sports channel like Prime Ticket ought to pick up the Cal 
State Long Beach football games now that George Allen is the coach. The guy is 
pure drama on TV. All he needs to find is a Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE AGES: Forgot how exhilarating hatred can be until I flipped on Mel 
Brooks' musical attack, "Springtime for Hitler," from "The Producers," on 
cable's new Comedy Channel. 
</P>
<P>
DRAWING BOARD: Oprah Winfrey's new ABC drama series, "Brewster Place," based on 
her special about black women in a ghetto, is due this spring. And if it 
puzzles you why such a major project is being launched at midseason, an ABC 
spokesman notes that the network's other spring tryouts included "The Wonder 
Years," "China Beach," "Perfect Strangers," "Anything But Love," "Coach" and 
"Just the Ten of Us." Well, let's forget the last one. 
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE BEND: Saigon and Vietnam in general look pretty distant and real 
when you watch them on "Tour of Duty." Especially considering the show is shot 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
PERIOD PIECE: Golden State's Chris Mullin looks so much like a 1950s basketball 
player that they ought to televise his games in black-and-white. But he is 
magnificent, and he really belongs on the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
VICTORY: It's the ultimate tribute. Ted Turner couldn't colorize "Citizen Kane" 
because Orson Welles protected it contractually even after his death. And now 
Turner, on his TNT channel, will present a show about his conqueror, "Orson 
Welles: Stories From a Life in Film," on Feb. 5. Among Welles' famous quotes: 
"I began at the top (with 'Citizen Kane') and have been working my way down 
ever since." 
</P>
<P>
TALL: ESPN's Roy Firestone asked Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to define character. 
Kareem said it was doing the right thing even when it's not profitable. By the 
end of the interview, Kareem seemed like a great prospect for NBA commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "I don't trust warm and friendly people." Who said it? Lou Grant 
in "Lou Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

Maoist guerrillas of Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) swept into an Andean 
village and killed at least 28 residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 rebels invaded the village of Acos Vinchos before dawn and went house 
to house, shooting both adults and children. Before they left, the rebels 
burned the town hall and an abandoned army barracks. Residents of the village 
had long resisted efforts to recruit them for the insurgency.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the opposition of plotting to create 
a "situation like Panama" by withdrawing from the Feb. 25 national elections. 
He said he told Elliot Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general who is 
monitoring the campaign and election for the United Nations, that he fears such 
a ploy would set the stage for the United States to declare the election 
fraudulent and invade the country. Opposition spokesman Danilo Lacayo denied 
that the National Opposition Union will withdraw and called Ortega's statement 
just another maneuver.

CSUN DOES THE EXPECTED -- LOSES TO USC IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In sports, inexperience often leads to unpredictability. Volleyball, however, 
is an exception. Cal State Northridge learned that lesson Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without setter Matt Unger -- who is temporarily ineligible -- against a 
powerful team from USC, the Matadors were all too predictable in a 
nonconference match at CSUN that served as the season opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Trojans took only 1 hour 40 minutes to dispatch Northridge, 
15-5, 15-12, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Unger, a redshirt sophomore, is attending interim classes and will not regain 
his eligibility until the middle of next week at the earliest, Coach John Price 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in Unger's place was Gary Reznick, a freshman from Taft High, who was 
a bit skittish in his collegiate debut. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a loss was Unger? 
</P>
<P>
"Huge," Price said without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, was USC's margin of victory. The Trojans trailed only once, 3-2, in 
the match's final game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been practicing and playing better than this," Price said. "We're 
capable of playing much better. 
</P>
<P>
"Our passing was poor and we were very predictable. We were struggling with who 
to give the ball to. Our hitters were going against two (blockers) all night 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Ivie, a member of the U. S. national team, was a mainstay in the middle 
for the Trojans. He had match-highs with seven blocks and 24 kills. USC hit 
.343 as a team to Northridge's .216. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael Tulino, a junior middle-blocker, was a bright spot for the Matadors. He 
had a team-high 19 kills (on a .531 attack percentage) and five blocks. 
Freshman Coley Kyman had 16 kills, but only a .067 attack percentage.

BOAT BUILDERS AND DEALERS GET THAT SINKING FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buzz Hardy, the owner of Sundown Marine in San Diego, stands to lose more than 
$600 on each of the five sleek 17-foot Glastron Futura powerboats now on sale 
at his dealership for $13,600, a 20% markdown from his asking price six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Such close-out prices are a first in Hardy's 13-year career as a boat merchant. 
But, with Sundown's 1989 boat sales down 25% from the previous year, and with 
1990 off to a less than auspicious start, Hardy just can't afford to watch his 
showroom become a perpetual dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was buying. Nobody was even looking," Hardy said. "It's not that people 
were out there wanting to buy but couldn't get credit. They just flat weren't 
coming into the store." 
</P>
<P>
The price cuts by Hardy and several other Southern California boat dealers were 
a symptom of a significant slump in recreational power boat sales nationwide 
last year, the first decline in boat sales after seven years of growth. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the National Marine Manufacturers Assn., boat 
sales dropped last year to 638,000, a 15% decline from the 749,000 units sold 
in 1988. The sales figures include sailboats and power boats. Total dollars 
spent on all boats and boating accessories fell to $17.1 billion in 1989, from 
$17.9 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have blamed everything from bad weather and rising interest 
rates to the San Francisco earthquake, which hit just a few days before one of 
Southern California's biggest boat shows, for the seven-month slump. But the 
one thing on which everyone agrees is that dealers were stocked with more boats 
than they could sell at a time when consumers were looking elsewhere for 
recreation and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was contracting, and we continued to build into that down cycle," 
said Greg Proteau, spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers Assn. in 
Chicago. "It's very hard to just turn off the switch, and it's going to be a 
little difficult to turn it back on." 
</P>
<P>
The power boat industry has gone through tremendous change since the end of 
1986, when most boats were assembled by dealers who had to buy the boat shell, 
engine and trailer from separate specialty manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
At about that time, Brunswick and Outboard Marine, two of the nation's largest 
producers of powerboat engines, began to realize that there were profits to be 
made by integrating the industry, and embarked on plans to bring the disparate 
aspects of boat making under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1986, Brunswick took the first step by spending $425 million to 
acquire Bayliner Marine, which is generally regarded as the first boat company 
to package boats, engines and trailers at reduced prices. Outboard Marine soon 
followed suit, and, by February, 1989, had spent $230 million to buy 10 smaller 
boat manufacturing companies, including Chris Craft and Four Winns, two widely 
recognized brand names. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions appeared to be to everyone's benefit, said Outboard vice 
president Wayne Jones. "Dealers like the idea of not having to be the final 
assembler. Boat manufacturers can do their job more cheaply by prerigging all 
the controls in a boat. And consumers like the one-stop shopping." 
</P>
<P>
But many dealers now say they were taken in by the acquisition frenzy, 
encouraged to take on more boats than they could sell by smaller manufacturers 
who were eager to look attractive to the big buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period of acquisition, a lot of boat manufacturers exaggerated 
their production and filled the dealer pipelines with excessive inventory," 
said Tom Fetter, owner of Kettenburg Marine in San Diego, a large distributor 
of marine parts. 
</P>
<P>
But rising interest rates and declining consumer confidence soon led to a slip 
in sales by early spring, marking the start of what many analysts describe as a 
leveling off period for the boating industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Outboard Marine projected net losses in the $15-million to 
$19-million range for the first quarter ended Dec. 31, with total sales down 
about 12% from last year. Although a $100-million pretax restructuring charge 
last year makes it difficult to compare Brunswick's earnings in 1989 with the 
year before, securities analysts put the marine segment's losses, excluding 
extraordinary charges, at about $10 million for each of the last two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices of both publicly held companies have recently traded at or near 
their 52-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to streamline its costs and to combat massive declines in 
powerboat sales, Brunswick last summer reorganized its marine group, closed six 
plants and laid off more than 4,000 workers. But some predict the decline will 
continue at least through the end of the year, if not longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat business is in trouble and it has been for some time," said Merrill 
Lynch securities analyst Harold Vogel. "The consumer is tapped out. They're 
borrowed up to their necks. Their houses aren't increasing in value. I 
personally think it's a recession, and that it's not going to turn around any 
time soon." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that bleak prognosis, many local dealers remain optimistic they will be 
able to ride out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Several dealers interviewed said they are coping with the sales slump by 
stepping up advertising, cutting prices and passing on manufacturer-sponsored 
financing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy of Sundown Marine said that some customers have been buying boats from 
him through an aggressive loan-financing program made available through 
Outboard Marine that required no down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Ciccarelli, a principal of Newport Pacific boat dealership in Newport 
Beach, said he cut about 3% from his boat prices about six months ago in order 
to make the boats more attractive and to eliminate a "negotiating buffer" that 
allowed "a silver-tongued attorney to get a better deal than a blue collar 
worker who doesn't have the same verbal skills." 
</P>
<P>
He also put younger people who are willing to work for less money onto his 
sales force and and trained them to drum up prospective customers with 
telephone and direct mail solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
Other dealers are consolidating their operations or offering a wider array of 
recreational products to their customers. Sea Ray power boats in San Diego, 
recently joined forces with Winnebago dealer Herb Hulet in an effort to "hedge 
our bet into the '90s," Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales slump has changed the way a lot of powerboat dealers do 
business, it appears to have had less effect on dealers who sell big, expensive 
yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Sperling, co-owner of Pacific Yacht Sales in Marina del Rey, said that, 
although he saw fewer first-time buyers last year, he more than made up the 
difference in sales of larger boats, many priced at more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tended to sell more and more boats in the 38-foot to 58-foot category," 
Sperling said. "We've also tended to see people graduating into larger and 
larger boats." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the operative phrase for the 1990s, according to the National Assn. of 
Marine Products and Services, is "Fewer but larger," with weaker companies 
closing shop and profitable ones consolidating and winning larger shares of the 
boating market. 
</P>
<P>
By 1994, according to a study published by the association, the number of 
healthy dealerships nationwide is expected to drop to 8,000 from a high in 1988 
of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the surviving dealers are expected to generate an average of $2.4 
million each in sales, up from an average of $1.3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"As an industry, we overproduced," said Joseph Kaswell, editor of Marine 
Industry, a national trade magazine. "Until that pipeline gets cleared out, 
we'll have a period of adjustments, and then we will be able to grow from 
there. For consumers, it's a very good period. But we'll be losing dealers, and 
we'll be losing manufacturers, and they'll be slashing prices to try to 
survive."

LAS VEGAS AIRLINE PLANS FLIGHTS FROM PALOMAR AIRPORT TO LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Las Vegas-based airline has applied to San Diego County for approval to begin 
four nonstop daily commuter flights between Palomar Airport in Carlsbad and Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
There is now no air service from North County to Los Angeles, and Grand 
Airways' application to inaugurate flights comes two months after the previous 
applicant, Resort Commuter Airlines of Orange County, filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Warner, marketing assistant for Grand Airways, said Monday that 
"everything has been applied for" to operate nine-passenger, twin-propeller 
aircraft from Palomar, starting March 1. Although a fare hasn't been set, she 
estimated each 45-minute, one-way flight will cost $49. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a great deal of marketing research" before selecting Palomar Airport, 
she said. "It was one of the points that could be utilized because people are 
darn tired of driving" to jobs in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Since the airport opened in 1960, seven efforts to either begin or sustain 
commuter service have failed. Most recently, Resort Commuter contracted with 
Pan American World Airways to operate six flights daily from Carlsbad, but 
filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy Nov. 17 before service could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Warner said Grand Airways is seeking approval for six daily flights, but will 
begin with four trips using smaller aircraft until the public's interest is 
known. "If the response is wonderful, we'll put in as many (flights) as the 
market demands and the community needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Palomar Airport have insisted that Resort Commuter use quieter, 
propeller-driven aircraft as a condition for approval. Warner said Grand 
Airways would use either the Cessna 402 or Piper aircraft, which are smaller 
than the 19-passenger models Resort had planned to use. 
</P>
<P>
"We fly props," said Warner. "We're not going into jets or larger aircraft 
until we see whether the market warrants it." 
</P>
<P>
She said Grand Airways started in 1980, has 35 employees, a fleet of 14 
aircraft and runs charter flights from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. "We are 
in an expansion program" that not only includes possible Carlsbad-Los Angeles 
service, but also commuter flights from Ontario, China Lake, Apple Valley and 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Airways' application goes before the Palomar Airport Advisory Committee, 
which will make a recommendation to the county Board of Supervisors. County 
offices were closed Monday, so neither county airport director Al Newman nor 
Palomar Airport manager Rick Severson could be reached for comment.

RACQUETBALL REBOUND BOOSTS EKTELON'S SALES; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTING GOODS: SAN DIEGO COMPANY IS BELIEVED TO CONTROL MORE THAN 50% OF THE 
U.S. MARKET. INNOVATION IS CITED AS THE KEY TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After leveling off from rapid growth in the 1970s, the popularity of 
racquetball has rebounded significantly since 1987. And that's given a big 
boost to sales at Ektelon, the San Diego-based sporting goods manufacturer 
believed to control more than 50% of the U.S. racquetball equipment market. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in San Diego in 1967, Ektelon makes racquets, balls, shoes, gloves, eye 
wear, bags and accessories, making it perhaps the most vertically integrated 
racquetball company around. The company is owned by closely held Prince 
Holdings in Princeton, N.J., which acquired it in October 1988 from Browning 
Arms Co. of Morgan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of Ektelon's sale to Prince, the nation's leading seller of tennis 
racquets, were not disclosed. Published reports have estimated Prince's 
revenues at more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at Ektelon are up by 25% from the level of two years ago and have doubled 
since 1986, it president, Norm Peck, said. He wouldn't release precise revenue 
figures, but insiders say the company accounts for more than half of all 
racquetball equipment sales in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Using the National Sporting Goods Assn.'s estimate of $59.8 million in total 
racquetball goods sold in 1988, the most recent year for which figures are 
available, Ektelon's current annual sales could exceed $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of racquetball's popularity is evidence of the durability of 
racquetball as a participant sport and of the constantly changing exercise 
habits of U.S. consumer-athletes, said Jim Haiser, assistant executive director 
of the American Amateur Racquetball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Racquetball "was a faddish sport in the late 1970s and early 1980s. People got 
into it and out of it," Haiser said. "Now people are taking it up as an 
alternative source of conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
After peaking at 9.9 million participants in 1984, racquetball's popularity 
tailed off to 7.9 million players in 1987, according to NSGA spokesman Dan 
Kasen. The sport's appeal was probably undercut by the rising popularity of 
aerobics and weight training during those years, Haiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, people interested in keeping themselves in shape are more likely to play 
several sports than stick to just one, Haiser said. That diversification of 
conditioning methods, combined with recent studies that show racquetball 
provides a good aerobics and calorie-burning exercise, have given the sport 
renewed appeal. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haiser, a typical racquetball player's heart rate reaches 70% to 
80% of maximum during a 15- to 20-minute game, a nearly optimal aerobics 
workout. Players generally spend at least an hour on the court at a time, 
breaking briefly two or three times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to National Racquetball magazine, more than 10 million Americans 
played racquetball in 1988. About 2 million of those are classified as frequent 
players, meaning they play more than 25 times a year. Racquetball courts now 
total 18,000 to 20,000 at 3,500 locations across the country, Ektelon said. 
</P>
<P>
After its founding by former Olympic athlete Bud Held, Ektelon introduced its 
first product, a racquet-stringing machine, in 1967. Two years later, the 
company introduced its first racquet, the first aluminum alloy model in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the company unveiled the first racquet made of composites, an extra 
strong substance similar to plastic epoxy, and, in 1984, the first oversized 
racquetball racquet. Innovations such as these, plus imaginative marketing have 
given Ektelon a 2-to-1 lead in market share over its nearest market competitor, 
Wilson Sporting Goods, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Joel and Jeff Lehrer, co-owners of Frontier Pro Shop, a racquet sporting goods 
shop on Midway Drive that is one of Ektelon's leading retail and wholesale 
outlets, said new products and good styling and packaging have helped give 
Ektelon its competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
"Innovation is the whole thing. It really stimulates the market and gets people 
to try something new," Joel Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ektelon's payroll ranges from 175 to 200 during the year, depending on seasonal 
demand. Employment increases during late fall and winter, when products are in 
highest demand in the eastern United States. The sport is regarded in the East 
as mainly a winter, indoor sport, Peck said. West Coast racquetballers play 
year-round, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's administrative and manufacturing activities are situated at its 
64,000-square-foot Aero Drive plant. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Ektelon in 1980 as promotions manager, Peck, 41, spent eight 
years as a squash and tennis coach at Princeton University. He said the 
company's strength has been its concentration on racquetball products. 
</P>
<P>
But the company last year introduced its first squash racquet, and Peck says 
the company hopes that squash becomes the next sports fad. 
</P>
<P>
"Squash is already hot on the East Coast, and there is definitely growth 
potential," Peck said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: ELECTRO RENT'S INCOME FALLS 17% FOR PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electro Rent Corp., a Van Nuys company that rents and sells electronic test 
equipment, said its net income for the three months that ended Nov. 30 fell 17% 
to $1.84 million from $2.21 million for the same quarter in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the period were down 6% to $27.3 million from $28.9 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>

For the six-month period, Electro Rent said its net income fell 19% to $3.55 
million from $4.39 million a year before. Six-month revenues dropped 7% to 
$53.9 million from $58.3 million last year.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: SHAMROCK HOLDINGS SELLS DALLAS RADIO STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrock Holdings in Burbank agreed to sell radio station KMGC-FM in Dallas for 
$22 million to Cooke Inlet Radio Partners, a broadcast-station operator based 
in Greenbelt, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock, owned by the Roy E. Disney family, also said it expects to sell two 
other radio stations, KUDL-FM in Kansas City, Kan., and WHB-AM in Kansas City, 
Mo., and two television stations in Texas, KXXV-TV in Waco and KTAB-TV in 
Abilene. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock President Bill Clark said the sale of those four stations could bring 
about $30 million. He also said the proposed sales are part of Shamrock's plan 
to reduce debt and provide cash to its owners. 
</P>
<P>
The sales would leave Shamrock with one TV station and 12 radio stations, he 
said.

CALCIUM ABSORPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I heard an explanation of how taking certain nutrients can interfere 
with the amount of calcium the body has, but frankly I did not follow the 
discussion very well. For example, could you please explain what protein has to 
do with calcium? If I have both protein and calcium, what difference does it 
make? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Various other nutrients may affect the way the body uses calcium. An 
excessive intake of protein tends to increase the loss of calcium in the urine. 
In addition, fat and fiber may affect calcium retention. A high dietary intake 
of fat interferes with the absorption of calcium, while excessive amounts of 
fiber cause food to pass rapidly through the intestine, which limits the 
absorption time.

JAZZMAN MCPHERSON TRIES A BROADER APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saxophonist Charles McPherson has a new sound in mind, but he doesn't think it 
will compromise the old McPherson, the pure be-bopper who came up under the 
guidance of Barry Harris and Charles Mingus. 
</P>
<P>
Alto specialist McPherson has concentrated on composing in recent months. He'll 
mix this new music with several of his older tunes plus jazz and popular 
standards at Elario's, where he opens a two-week stand Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson called his latest material "a hybrid concoction of classic be-bop 
with today's sound, with mild electronic and/or acoustic rhythm sections 
playing be-bop rhythms behind today's harmonies and musical forms." 
</P>
<P>
Part of this approach includes simpler, funkier rhythms -- which might attract 
new listeners. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean McPherson is watering down the tempered, Charlie 
Parker-influenced sound that won him a job dubbing sax parts for Clint 
Eastwood's "Bird," a tribute to the legendary bop saxophonist. McPherson thinks 
it is possible to keep his artistic integrity while making music a broader 
audience can appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
To play the new material, McPherson plans to form a new band, starting with his 
son Charles Jr. on drums, and probably joined by a handful of top players from 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in his career, McPherson deserves a better hearing. He hasn't 
recorded an album as a leader since 1985's "The Prophet," after turning out 
more than 20 albums as a leader since the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he's been idle. McPherson is in constant demand for live dates around 
the world. He goes to Europe several times a year and just returned from 
England, where he worked clubs and concert halls in several British cities. 
Last weekend, he taped a KPBS-TV "Club Date" program, and made a guest 
appearance on a second "Club Date" featuring pianist Kenny Barron. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, McPherson sat in the small living room of the La Jolla cottage he 
uses as a studio to talk about his life in jazz. He had just finished a 
practice session. At one point, he apologized that his morning coffee seemed to 
have caused a thought jam, although there was no apparent shortage of ideas. He 
stood up often and paced, or looked out the window as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson didn't care to divulge his age, but he let it slip that Parker was 19 
years older than he. Parker, who died in 1955, would be 69 today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pull a Jack Benny and be 39 for the next 25 years," McPherson 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has always kept a following among hard-core jazz fans, he said the 
attention surrounding "Bird" gave his career a boost. McPherson was 15 when he 
first met Parker in Detroit and spent an hour dogging his idol. 
</P>
<P>
"He answered every idiot question I asked. The only time he got short with me 
was when he asked for a match, and I couldn't find one." 
</P>
<P>
Both men were born in the Midwest: Parker in Kansas City, Kan., McPherson in 
Joplin, Mo., 150 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
"People back there feel the blues a certain way; they approach it a certain 
way," McPherson said. "That's when I first wanted to play, when I was 6 or 7 in 
Joplin." 
</P>
<P>
McPherson spent his teen years in Detroit in the mid-'50s, when black and white 
influences were merging into the popular sound of doo-wop and rock 'n' roll. He 
remembers playing with bands that emulated groups such as the Oreos and the 
Drifters. 
</P>
<P>
He honed his sax skills in high school bands, and took lessons from the 
well-known jazz pianist Barry Harris, who just happened to live in his 
neighborhood. At the time, Harris was the house pianist at the Blue Bird in 
Detroit, where Miles Davis, Sonny Stitt, Max Roach and other jazz stars played 
when they hit town. 
</P>
<P>
Harris gave McPherson a working knowledge of theory and a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry would practice all day long. He instilled in me a sense of 
intelligence," McPherson said. "I started studying with him when I was 15, and 
I remember him seeing my report card, which was quite average. He said, 'You 
can't have a report card with Cs. The kind of guys you're trying to play like 
are not average at all.' 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me to develop a reading habit, to learn about De Maupassant, about 
philosophy, about dance. He said, 'You've got to know what those people were 
talking about. Then you'll have something to play about.' " 
</P>
<P>
McPherson left Detroit for New York City in the late '50s to seek his fortune. 
It didn't take him long to get noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been there a few months, working with a house band at a little 
coffeehouse in Greenwich Village," he said. "Eric Dolphy and Ted Curson were 
quitting Charles Mingus' band, and he needed an alto man and a trumpeter." 
</P>
<P>
Mingus had heard about McPherson and his best friend, trumpeter Lonnie Hillyer. 
One afternoon, Mingus came to the Village and sat in with them. They were 
hired, and McPherson spent 12 stormy years with Mingus. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so volatile. I got into horrendous situations. He demanded absolute 
quiet, and would start fights if he didn't get it," McPherson said. "I made a 
point not to stand next to him on stage in case some guy came back with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"His harmony impressed me. And some of the form. He had a haunting sound. 
Mingus would write all day. He had a big piano in the middle of his Village 
flat. Everything else was in disarray, everything around the piano was 
crumbling. He liked the act of writing. That impressed me in terms of 
discipline, being consumed by your work." 
</P>
<P>
Mingus, influenced by Duke Ellington, often wrote charts tailored to his band 
members. He penned several tunes to showcase McPherson, including 
"Meditations," which appears on the mid-'60s album "Mingus at Monterey." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, McPherson first heard saxophonist John Coltrane. They lived 
close to each other in New York, and Coltrane's wife used to watch McPherson's 
children. McPherson would hear the sax man practicing when he picked up his 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
He left Mingus in 1972 to front his own group. He moved to San Diego in 1978 to 
be closer to his mother in La Jolla and other members of his family, but still 
plays the top New York clubs.

NEW PRINCIPALS IN 'LA TRAVIATA' BY OPERA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Opera Pacific production of Verdi's "La Traviata" represents no milestone 
of interpretive insight. However, it makes good traditional sense -- a few 
directorial quirks notwithstanding -- so long as the three central roles are 
well cast. 
</P>
<P>
They were well cast for the opening performance, Saturday night at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. They turned out to be less well cast at the 
Sunday matinee. Such are the vicissitudes in an irrational art that allows 
robust but consumptive heroines to sing strenuous arias on their pathetic 
deathbeds. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the center of attention among the alternate principals was the brave 
young soprano attempting the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Friede, originally scheduled for the assignment, withdrew last week 
either because of ill health (the official company explanation) or because of 
disagreements with the management (the rumor-mill explanation). In her place 
came a little known, would-be diva named Brenda Harris. 
</P>
<P>
She is talented, make no mistake. She is statuesque and pretty. She commands an 
array of sweet and pure tones that can move about a wide range with 
considerable agility. She is a conscientious actress. 
</P>
<P>
She made all the right motions. She even avoided the grotesquerie of painting 
crimson circles on her cheeks in the quasi-mad scene concocted by the local 
director for the last act. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, alas, made her an instant Violetta. For all her professionalism 
and assurance, she did little on Sunday to illuminate the tragedy of the 
courtesan who foreswears love in quest of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Whether dealing with rapture, fear, renunciation, hysteria or agony, she 
produced the same invariably lovely sounds (up to but not including a squeaky 
E-flat unwisely ventured at the end of "Sempre libera"). Ultimately, she gave a 
bland, immature performance more notable for promise than for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
At best, she was a Gilda. This was a girl sent in to do a woman's job. 
</P>
<P>
As Alfredo, Rico Serbo acted with convincing ardor and introduced an unexpected 
bit of motivation for the hero's desperate swagger in the gambling scene: He is 
drunk. Unfortunately, Serbo's dry, nasal, often tremulous tenor tended to 
compromise dramatic compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Poulimenos, the strong and dark-voiced Germont pere, looked chronically 
angry and sounded chronically gruff. Like his colleagues, he paid little 
attention to matters of dynamic subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this "Traviata" followed familiar patterns. Bernard Uzan's staging 
scheme remained perfectly functional despite some cheap effects (an itinerant 
puppy-dog steals the scene in Act III). Mark Flint again conducted with more 
brio than precision, but the orchestra showed signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
Violetta will be undertaken Friday night and Sunday afternoon by a third 
soprano, Nova Thomas, who scored a considerable success here last season as 
Adalgisa opposite the Norma of Joan Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most opera companies in the civilized world, Opera Pacific allows late 
seating and thus spoils much of the first act for those who care enough to 
arrive on time. 
</P>
<P>
The audience on this occasion included one non-bel-canto baby equipped with 
leather lungs. Early cultural education is very nice, but this is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific's production of Verdi's "La Traviata" continues through Sunday 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Performances Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: 
$20 to $69. Information: (714) 546-7372.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: 'LA BOHEME' CHANGES -- 
-- DRAMATIC OR JUST TINKERING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Campbell may not be superstitious, but San Diego Opera's general director 
thought it would be propitious to open the company's 25th season with a reprise 
of Puccini's "La Boheme," the opera that launched the local company in 1965. 
And, although San Diego Opera owns a respectable "Boheme" set -- one hallowed 
by the 1980 performances of that larger-than-life Rodolfo, Luciano Pavarotti -- 
Campbell decided that a new production was in order for the silver anniversary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the late Stella Sharp, a former opera patron, left San Diego Opera a 
bequest to underwrite a new Puccini production (her husband, Fred C. Sharp, was 
treasurer of the San Diego Opera Guild when its 1965 "Boheme" turned the guild 
into a real production company). For the project, Campbell chose American 
designer John Conklin, who worked out the plan with the production's British 
director, John Copley. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin is well-known for his set designs at Santa Fe Opera and for his recent 
complete "Ring" cycle at San Francisco Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Although he and Copley did not mount a trendy modernization of the piece, the 
designers decided to move the setting of the opera from Paris of the 1840s to 
Paris of the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
"Puccini and his librettists set the opera in the 1840s, following Murger, on 
whose novel ('Scenes de la Vie de Boheme') the opera is based. But we thought 
that Paris of the 1890s -- the Paris of Toulouse-Lautrec and the time when 
Puccini actually wrote the opera -- would have more resonance," Conklin said. 
He explained that it was more than the visual appeal of the vivid posters of 
Parisian night life in the Gay Nineties that drew him to this era. 
</P>
<P>
Musetta, the opera's other female character, "is a music-hall actress, so, for 
her big scene, the stage is filled with bright-colored theater posters and 
contemporary advertisements," Conklin said. "All of the objects in the posters 
and advertisements symbolize the city life that both excites and traps the 
characters in the opera. The design also fits Copley's directing style, since 
he has a wonderful sense of naturalistic detail." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, critics have complained that some opera productions have 
become more identified by their designers and directors than by their 
composers, e.g. David Hockney's "Tristan," Franco Zefferelli's "La Boheme" and 
Peter Sellars' "Tannhauser." Not surprisingly, Conklin does not think this is a 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
"Hasn't it always been that way?" he asked. "These things don't have a Platonic 
existence. Doing a play or a composition 'the way the author or composer wrote 
it' sounds simple, but it doesn't work that way. After all, we talk of Serkin's 
Beethoven and Bernstein's Mahler without apology. Someone has to be the medium 
for the audience, to work it through for performance. What is unfortunate is a 
production in which the director and designer have been so timid that the 
result is merely routine." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's San Diego Opera opening-nighters will be able to decide whether 
Conklin and Copley have been successful as visual and dramatic midwives or have 
simply redefined routine. 
</P>
<P>
Return of Cardenes. The San Diego Mini-Concert Committee has announced that 
former San Diego Symphony concertmaster Andres Cardenes will return in March to 
perform the complete violin sonatas of Brahms and Schubert. Cardenes, now 
concertmaster for the Pittsburgh Symphony and faculty member of Carnegie-Mellon 
University, will be accompanied by San Diego State University pianist Karen 
Follingstad. The two programs, March 6 and 8, will be at La Jolla's St. James 
Episcopal Church.

Another fiddler makes his mark. Frank Almond, the San Diego violinist who was a 
laureate of Moscow's 1986 Tchaikovsky International Competition, made his 
Washington debut Jan. 7 with a recital in the Phillips Gallery. Washington Post 
reviewer Gordon Sparber praised Almond's "beautifully large G-string sound, 
sure-fire trickery and unbelievably facile bow arm" in the recital's bravura 
pieces, although he complained that the young performer's energetic Brahms A 
Major Sonata lacked refinement. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of this recital, as well as an interview with Almond, were broadcast 
on National Public Radio's "Performance Today" program last week. Almond, who 
is a guest faculty member at SDSU this year, will perform in a chamber music 
program Feb. 3 at San Diego's First Unitarian Church. In March, Almond will 
give recitals with pianist William Wolfram, his Washington accompanist, at the 
Cultural Center in Manila and in other Philippine cities.

Postscripts. Avant-garde mavens will not want to miss Friday's UC San Diego 
performance by Richard Teitelbaum, pioneer in electronic music composition and 
improvisation. Teitelbaum had the honor -- some might counter the dubious 
distinction -- of introducing the Moog synthesizer to European audiences. The 
American composer also founded the live electronic music group Musica 
Elettronica Viva in Rome in 1966. This 8 p.m. concert in Mandeville Recital 
Hall will complete Teitelbaum's two-week residency at the university. . . . 
Auditions for the 35th annual Young Artists Competition sponsored by the La 
Jolla Symphony and Chorus will be Feb. 3-4 at UCSD. The competition is open to 
instrumentalists and vocalists in San Diego County who are 30 or younger, and 
there is a junior division for instrumentalists 18 and younger. . . . If you've 
always harbored a secret desire to play the recorder, La Jolla's Athenaeum 
begins an eight-week introductory course tomorrow night under the tutelage of 
music educator David McNair, for many years director of the Old Globe Consort. 
Bring your own flageolet.

STILL-SOGGY S.D. TO TAKE MORE COLD SHOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With barely a break from the wet and wild weekend storm that dumped more than 
an inch of rain and caused some minor power outages, a new storm expected to 
arrive this afternoon could bring even more rain, cold and a host of 
weather-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lindbergh Field got 1.09 inches of rain over the weekend, raising the season 
total to 3.32 inches. Sporadic showers are expected to continue through 
Thursday and drop as much as three-quarters of an inch of rain, forecasters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric reported a handful of rain-related power outages 
affecting a few thousand customers over the weekend, a spokesman said. On 
Monday, repair crews worked to restore power to about 200 people in Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming storm from the Gulf of Alaska is "very, very cold," said Wilbur 
Shigehara, a National Weather Service forecaster. Snow is expected as low as 
the 1,500-foot level, and icy conditions may prompt a traveler's advisory for 
the mountains and a frost advisory for the agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold from this storm is concerning me the most," Shigehara said. "As early 
as Thursday night, some temperatures will drop into the mid- and upper 20s, and 
that will require growers to provide some type of frost protection for their 
crops." 
</P>
<P>
The cold also may prompt the county to open its shelters for the homeless, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said that, although the county needs more rain, the weekend moisture 
has already saturated the ground, and a deluge could cause street flooding and 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, daytime highs will be in the mid-60s. Surf is at 3 to 6 feet, 
and the ocean temperature is 58 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal and inland daytime temperatures will struggle to hit 60 degrees this 
week, Shigehara said. Overnight lows along the coast will be in the mid-40s, 
and inland lows will dip into the low 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs today through Thursday will hover in the mid-30s, Shigehara 
said. Overnight lows will be in the low 20s and may drop into the high teens by 
Friday night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Highs in the desert will range in the mid-60s, and lows will be in the 40s, 
Shigehara said.

POLICE SEEK GIRL ABDUCTED NEAR BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police are asking for help in the search for a Mexican teen-ager who 
crossed the border Friday at San Ysidro and is believed to have been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect is in custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Erica Lillian Perez Ramirez, 16, and her 
sister, Ana Maria Perez Ramirez, 20, crossed the border about 8 p.m. Friday and 
waited inside a restaurant in the 600 block of East San Ysidro Boulevard for a 
man who was supposed to take them to a "drop house," where they would be 
transported farther north. 
</P>
<P>
When the man arrived, he told the women that he could take only one of them in 
his car. Robinson said the elder Ramirez refused to be separated from her 
sister. The man then grabbed the teen-ager, threw her in the back of his car 
and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a San Diego police officer was questioning several men outside a bus 
station while Ana Ramirez sat in the police car. As the officer spoke to the 
men, one of them walked away, Robinson said. Ana Ramirez yelled that he was the 
man who had grabbed her sister. 
</P>
<P>
The officer stopped the man, and Ana Ramirez identified him, Robinson said. 
Daniel Lopez, 30, of Sampson Street in Logan Heights, was arrested on suspicion 
of kidnaping and on possession of heroin, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, a brown Datsun B210 with Baja California license plates, was found in 
the 400 block of East San Ysidro Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But, Robinson said, police have found no trace of Erica Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
She was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, black jeans and black boots. She is 
5 feet, 2 inches tall, weighs 115 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about this incident should call the department's San 
Ysidro division at 236-5901.

AL MARTINEZ: AN ITCH IN OLD CALABASAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't think I've ever had this kind of interview before. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, I ask a question and the person answers, and even though the 
answer might be a little obscure, I can figure it out. That's what we get paid 
to do, figure things out. 
</P>
<P>
But then there's Sharon Farrell. She's an actress who has been in some pretty 
good movies, like "The Reivers" with Steve McQueen, and is currently involved 
in trying to save the 145-year-old Leonis Adobe in Old Town Calabasas from the 
bulldozers of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who has blonde Shirley Temple curls and the intensity of a coiled 
spring, is putting together a party during which celebrity-artists will auction 
their paintings to benefit a Save the Adobe Fund. 
</P>
<P>
She herself is something of an accomplished artist who paints a couple of days 
a week at the Red River Gallery across from the aforementioned sacred adobe. 
</P>
<P>
When I met her at the gallery she was working on a canvas which she had turned 
upside down in order to preserve her point of view. At least, that's what I 
think she said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting information from Farrell involved an effort I had not anticipated. For 
instance, I asked how she got started painting. This was her answer: 
</P>
<P>
"Steve McQueen saw I was intense I guess and should get a hobby it was 'The 
Reivers' and we moved from Topanga to Beverly Hills and now Chance won't see me 
so we moved back to Topanga and got a Jacuzzi and one day I'm making sardine 
sandwiches for a football team in Beverly Hills and suddenly I'm not a mom 
anymore well what're you going to do the kid is growing up anyhow there I am 
working on a film and everyone is buying my paintings and it's a whole new 
thing for me but my husband says I ruined the painting do you think I should 
take the bridge out?" 
</P>
<P>
Whaaat? 
</P>
<P>
She scratched and bounced as she talked, like Tigger in "Winnie the Pooh." 
Also, which should be obvious, she spoke without punctuations and managed to 
slip from one subject to another with a facility that was almost supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why she scratched. She seemed pretty clean to me and probably 
didn't have fleas, although I know for a fact there are fleas in Topanga. I 
think it was a nervous itch. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, there she was scratching and bouncing around the gallery, with me 
trying to figure out what she was saying. 
</P>
<P>
I even went back twice in an effort to make sense out of my notes. The second 
time I took a tape recorder which I hardly ever use because they get awkward 
and require too much time to listen to when you should be good enough to get a 
quote without a machine in your hand my God I'm beginning to write the way she 
talks! 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute, everybody stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
It's a simple situation, really. Caltrans wants to put in a $40-million freeway 
interchange that would take out part of the famous old Leonis Adobe and alter 
the nature of the picturesque Western-type settlement around it. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of lawsuits have been filed and a lot of people are damned mad at 
Caltrans. There is nothing more savage than a preservationist in the attack. 
They'll kill to protect the past. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's that kind of spirit that has got Sharon Farrell scratching and 
bouncing. Or maybe she scratches and bounces all the time, who knows? Actresses 
are a funny bunch. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to do a kind of mini-profile on Farrell, but I would have to commit 
the rest of my career to plucking answers from her monologues, like an 
archeologist trying to make sense out of hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
The woman never seems to breathe during her replies. I tried to interrupt a 
couple of times but she sailed past me like a ship in a storm. So I just let 
her talk and took what I needed. 
</P>
<P>
I asked, for instance, "Where you from, Sharon?" 
</P>
<P>
She said: "Iowa and Kentucky too I guess I spent a lot of time at grandma's 
home with cows and chickens and pigs and that's what I wanted in Topanga what I 
mean I did everything for my kid and now he says why did you take us out of 
Topanga Barbra Streisand goes over and spies on her kids you know you want to 
be friends and they don't want to see you." 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. Anyhow, everyone is welcome to attend the party and auction 
at the Red River Gallery Feb. 24, a Saturday. It's free. 
</P>
<P>
According to Farrell, maybe Doug McClure will be there and Bo Hopkins though 
that isn't for sure and Ron Palillo from "Welcome Back Kotter" remember that 
great show and she wishes to God Barbara Carrera would stop being so shy and 
show up and she's got calls in to Jack Palance and Dennis Weaver did she say 
that Bruce Boxleitner came by one day on his horse? 
</P>
<P>
Probably.

OPTIMIST CLUB TURNS TO COMMUNITY TO TRY TO SALVAGE RECYCLING CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
TRASH: FINANCIAL LOSSES HAVE MOUNTED. MANAGEMENT CHANGES HAVE FAILED TO STEM 
THE ESCONDIDO OPERATION'S TAILSPIN INTO RED INK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Escondido's Noon Optimist Club Recycling Center is an unsightly community 
landmark where generations of Brownies, Camp Fire Girls, Webelos and Cub Scouts 
have exchanged sacks of pop cans and stacks of newspapers for cash to fuel 
their next project. 
</P>
<P>
Now the salvage center, at 1180 W. Washington Ave., has fallen on hard times, 
forced to lay off its crew and to discontinue payment for the recyclable trash 
its customers bring in. 
</P>
<P>
"We've paid the community for 18 years, and now we are asking the community to 
pay us back, at least temporarily," Hugh Dunning, the site manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, financial losses have mounted and management changes have 
failed to stem the tailspin into red ink that has turned the once-profitable 
salvage center into a liability. The center, which opened in 1974, has been a 
steady source of income for the Noon Optimist Club's many projects and other 
civic charities. Now it is a costly problem, requiring the hiring of auditors 
and attorneys to patch together the past and determine where the money went and 
who, if anyone, is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The chief victims of the center's collapse will be the projects it helps 
support: Huck Finn Day, a safe-driving project, Just Say No To Drugs, Teachers 
of Distinction, Opportunity School, Escondido Youth Encounter, Escondido Boys 
and Girls Club medical facility and a dozen others aided under the club's 
motto, "Friend of Youth." 
</P>
<P>
The club, a nonprofit organization, is hoping that the community will pitch in 
and donate its recyclables until the Optimist leaders can get the salvage 
center back on a firm footing or find someone who will. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning, who has been at the salvage yard since April, said the donated salvage 
will be sold and the profits turned over to the Optimist Club, "except for 
paying the bills, the lights and rent." 
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't venture a prediction on whether the nonprofit recycling center 
could survive now that it is asking its customers to be nonprofit too, but, he 
figures, "We'll find out soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
Arie DeJong, whose business interests include Liberty Salvage, a for-profit 
recycling venture in San Marcos, concedes that 1989 was no banner year for 
recyclers but doubts that the price squeeze could have brought a veteran 
recycling operation to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
"Between us, we have the longest track records in North County," DeJong said of 
the Optimist operation. "I have no idea why they are in such trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The "trouble" that the Escondido recycling center faces is the loss of its 
capital: a required reserve of $100,000 to $150,000 to pay its customers cash 
for cans or bottles or paper brought in until it is processed and sent to 
recycling companies to be turned into new products. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1989, the center had $104,000 in the bank. At year's end, the 
recyclers had only enough to pay off its employees, most of whom were then laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Optimist Club president Stan Oleksy said Monday that the club had made no 
charges against anyone about the losses, mainly because there is no way of 
knowing if there is a "bad guy" involved in the salvage center's crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The financial history of the center's operations, Oleksy concedes, is scanty. 
Most of the payments were made in cash, and many of the written records are 
incomplete or missing. One batch of records was discovered at the bottom of a 
trash bin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said too much already," Oleksy said. "I'm not saying anything at all 
to anyone until we get this sorted out and have some sort of solution." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Dunning said, the salvage center will remain open for donations of 
recyclable trash.

PORTER RANCH BLAST CALLED VANDALISM; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THREE JUVENILES ARRESTED IN THE DECEMBER BOMBING WEREN'T PROTESTING THE 
$2-BILLION PROJECT, POLICE SAY.

Three teen-agers arrested in a recent bombing of construction equipment in 
Porter Ranch were engaged in vandalism and were not protesting a proposed 
$2-billion development in the area, Los Angeles police announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A second incident, in which an unexploded bomb was found near another 
construction site in the area, remains under investigation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The three youths were arrested Thursday on suspicion of exploding an improvised 
device, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident occurred Dec. 20 when a small explosion damaged a 
front-loader parked on a construction site on Sesnon Boulevard near Louise 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A homemade device exploded on the seat of the vehicle owned by M.J. Brock &amp; 
Sons Construction, damaging the seat and shattering the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to say what evidence led them to the youths, who live in the 
area and were released to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they found no evidence linking the incident to the proposed 
1,300-acre Porter Ranch development being considered by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for the bombing was vandalism," said Detective Ken Bourne of the 
Criminal Conspiracy Unit. "There were no political overtones to the incident." 
</P>
<P>
Bourne said detectives are continuing to investigate a separate bomb incident 
Jan. 5, in which an unexploded device was found under a flatbed truck on Sesnon 
Boulevard near Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The device was discovered by a construction site security guard when it burst 
into flames but failed to explode, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bourne said there was no evidence linking the two bombs or connecting the 
second incident to the Porter Ranch proposal, which, if approved by the 
council, would become the largest single development in the city's history.

VANDALS MARK HOLIDAY BY DEFACING SIGNS BEARING DR. KING'S NAME ON 94 FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., vandals spray-painted a 
swastika and racial graffiti Monday on California 94 freeway signs carrying the 
slain civil rights leader's name. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of California 94 was christened in 
King's honor Nov. 20, the letters KKK were painted across one of the signs on 
the westbound side of the freeway near the Lemon Grove exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two signs were painted with the letters SWP, which police believe 
stand for Supreme White Power, and with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about 9 a.m. 
on the east side of the freeway near Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. Fred England said. 
</P>
<P>
The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring 
Street exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Walker Smith, pastor of the Christ United Presbyterian Church 
and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You 
can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to King has been 
a sore point for San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Board of Port Commissioners, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the City 
Council's request to name the convention center after King. The San Diego 
Convention Center opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four 
new signs on California 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, who led the convention center fight, denounced the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the 
elected leadership in San Diego has not taken a position on this. The 
leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should 
come out and condemn this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God on Imperial 
Avenue, was chairman of the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee, which was 
formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of the freeway after King is the last of several official attempts 
to find a place to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the City Council voted against naming California 94 for King 
and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year 
later, voters rejected Martin Luther King Way and restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that battle, members of the Chamber of Commerce worked with 
black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in Balboa 
Park, which hasn't been erected. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, following the Port District's decision on the convention 
center, the Legislature approved renaming California 94 at the urging of 
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula 
Vista). But the Legislature stipulated that private donations be used to pay 
for the new signs.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OVERTURNED HAY LOAD HURTS 2, CLOSES FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two motorists were injured and all eastbound lanes of the Foothill Freeway in 
Pacoima were closed briefly Monday morning when a truck lost its trailer and 
spilled more than 20 tons of hay, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 5 a.m. just east of the Simi Valley Freeway 
interchange, CHP Officer Monty Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was backed up about half a mile on the freeway into Sylmar as traffic 
was slowed by the blockage. A motorcyclist and the driver of a station wagon 
were injured when their vehicles struck the truck and debris in the road, the 
CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Greg Harris said CHP officers were able to open one lane of traffic in 
about an hour and a Caltrans cleanup crew opened the remaining three lanes by

The CHP was investigating what caused the hay trailer to come loose from the 
truck. The truck's driver, Darrel Soward, 44, of Pixley, said he was hauling 
the hay to Chino when the accident occurred. He was not cited pending the 
outcome of the investigation, Harris said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PEDESTRIAN KILLED BY CAR IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man killed when he stepped in front of a car in Studio City was identified by 
Los Angeles police Monday as a transient who had previously been cited for 
jaywalking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
John William Kocan, 46, was killed about 7 p.m. Sunday when he walked into 
traffic on Coldwater Canyon Avenue near Dickens Street and was struck by a 
northbound car, Detective Don Bellante said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the driver of the car because he was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the driver's fault," Bellante said. "This guy wandered out into the 
street where there was no crosswalk and into the traffic. He had done this 
before." Bellante said Kocan had been cited last month for jaywalking in the 
area, but details of that incident were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said results of tests to determine if Kocan was intoxicated were 
incomplete.

I have read the editorial with a very great interest and with one reservation: 
The editorial could have added one exception to the treatment of the issue. The 
editorial rightly supports the principle of the prohibition of unilateral 
intervention in violation of the sovereignty of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, to intervene militarily in the affairs of another nation is against 
international law and common sense, as in the case of the U.S. in Panama. But 
to intervene in the affairs of another nation whose leaders order the slaughter 
of millions of their own people, as in the case of Cambodia, should not be 
against international law. It is against international law because we are very 
selfish: Really we don't want "to rock the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Mazzini expresses this idea better than I. In speaking of 
nonintervention before the genocide of a nation, he said: "Neutrality is the 
willingness to give up every sense of human mission; it is passive existence; 
the neglect of what makes a people sacred; it is the negation of the Universal 
Right of Nations; it is egoism erected to a principle; it is a political 
atheism." 
</P>
<P>
It is a view to be considered very carefully if we want to continue to be human 
beings and not robots completely insensitive to the suffering of others.

FOREIGN CARS' IMPACT ON TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial "Front Seat for Honda Accord" (Jan. 6) was apparently written by 
someone who needs to explore the situation a bit deeper. True, the Accord is 
assembled here, but its parts are almost 100% imported. The writer lavished 
praise on the Japanese auto industry and scorn on our American counterpart for 
its lack of initiative. 
</P>
<P>
It's really unfortunate the U.S. auto industry has been under such heavy fire 
(fueled by this and similar editorials) for so long that many American 
consumers have become reluctant to give an excellent, quality product a fair 
chance. Our U.S. auto manufacturers and workers have turned the corner in both 
design and efficiency. We are now building and selling better than imported 
domestic vehicles at competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to our efforts to bolster the U.S. auto industry, your writer 
retreated to the standard right-wing line in deploring "protectionism" and 
hailing "free trade." Free trade should be a quid pro quo. The Japanese have 
effectively closed their market to U.S. exports and they'll never open it as 
long as U.S. consumers trip all over themselves to buy their products without a 
thought as to what Japan's restrictions are doing to the trade deficit and our 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Another point the writer should have pondered is the fact that the root word of 
"protectionism" is "protect." I, for one, see absolutely nothing wrong with 
American business and labor lobbying for legislation to protect our jobs, our 
economy and our way of life. Virtually every other industrial country in the 
world has tariffs or import duties designed to protect its own industry, labor 
and economy. We don't. If trade is to be truly free, it must be evenly 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
All we ask is fairness in our trade with other nations. Instead of thumbing 
your nose at the notion, you should insist on it.

PAN-AM HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to the map which appeared on Page A5 (Dec. 31) I wish to point out 
that the Pan-American Highway does not pass all the way through eastern Panama 
(Darien Province) and into Colombia but, in fact, stops well short of the 
Panama-Colombian border. Nor is there any likelihood that the road will be 
completed and for an interesting reason. 
</P>
<P>
At present there is a fairly extensive stand of tropical moist forest in the 
eastern-most part of Panama and this has been designated a national park 
(although given very limited protection during the Noriega years). 
</P>
<P>
The principal purpose of the park is to provide a barrier between Colombia 
where foot-and-mouth disease is known to occur and Panama and Central America 
where the disease does not occur. This disease, caused by a virus, is highly 
destructive of cattle and other ruminant mammals. Were it to get into Panama 
and Central America the export of beef to the United States would be stopped, 
thus causing considerable economic loss -- although it might also result in a 
cessation of forest-to-pasture conversion in the region.

</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: CONCENTRATED OR DISPERSED, MINORITY VOTING STRENGTH CAN BE 
UNDERCUT. A BETTER ROUTE IS A LARGER BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The trial of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors over the method they 
used in 1981 to redistrict the five supervisorial districts raises two 
fundamental questions that go beyond this particular case: What is the best way 
to empower a group, and how can political effectiveness be maximized for 
everyone? 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have been charged with drawing their district lines so that the 
county's Latino voters were spread over three districts rather than being 
concentrated more heavily in one or two. The plaintiffs contend that under the 
supervisors' plan, Latinos were denied a reasonable opportunity to elect one of 
their own because their voting strength was diluted among three districts. 
</P>
<P>
The first question is how best to empower a group, giving it a role in the 
decision-making process. Is a group better served if its members are lumped 
into a single district, thereby increasing substantially the possibility of 
electing a member of that group? Or is the group better represented if its 
people and voting strength are dispersed throughout the county, although not in 
sufficient numbers to constitute a majority of voters in any one district? 
</P>
<P>
Both approaches to political empowerment rest on assumptions that are appealing 
but questionable. If a district is created for a particular group, that may be 
the quickest way for it to gain formal office and to begin to build an 
effective base for further electoral victories. 
</P>
<P>
A single seat, however, may not ensure that the people can achieve their 
objectives. The board member may be politically isolated, or if all of a 
group's power is concentrated in one district, other board members may pay even 
less attention to that group's views. 
</P>
<P>
The other approach to acquiring decision-making authority is dispersing a 
group's voting strength throughout the county. It does not need a majority or 
even a plurality to influence the outcome of elections. In fact, in very close 
elections, it can considerably increase its voting power by being a swing bloc. 
</P>
<P>
There is the potential, therefore, for a group to be influential in more than 
one district, but essential conditions must exist, and these are difficult to 
ensure. It must either be cohesive in close elections or large enough to make 
major candidates pay attention to the group. 
</P>
<P>
The success of either empowerment approach, therefore, is dependent upon 
several variables. Selecting one strategy over the other cannot guarantee that 
true political power will be achieved automatically. 
</P>
<P>
The second political question stemming from this controversy is, how can all 
people in the county attain greater political effectiveness? A large part of 
the answer lies in changing the board itself. 
</P>
<P>
The number of supervisors should be increased to at least seven. Each of the 
supervisors today represents about 1.5 million people. By comparison, each of 
the 15 Los Angeles City Council members represents about 200,000 people. By 
adding two supervisors, the voting influence of everyone in the county is 
increased because the districts will be smaller. As a consequence, supervisors 
will be less geographically and politically removed from most of their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 million Latinos in the county should benefit immediately in several 
districts because of their population distribution. Yet all people in the 
county will have greater opportunity to make their votes count more than they 
do now. This in turn should make supervisors more responsive and accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Board of Supervisors carried through with two reform proposals made in 
the 1970s, this current trial might have been avoided. It was suggested then 
that the board membership be increased and that a separate office of county 
executive, elected by the voters, be created. 
</P>
<P>
The justification for the additional supervisors was the same as we read today: 
to get more diverse representation and to draw supervisors closer to the 
electorate. The rationale for the executive, a county mayor in effect, was that 
there should be separation of power and checks and balances in county 
government. Without an executive branch, the five supervisors act as both 
county legislature and executive. 
</P>
<P>
The major argument against these proposals was the added cost to the taxpayer. 
Less publicly, some of the supervisors did not want their political power 
diluted by new supervisors or assumed by the county executive. Hence, there was 
little political support for the ideas and they faded. 
</P>
<P>
No single reform or court decision can correct all the structural deficiencies 
of the board. Regardless of the ultimate disposition of this court case, some 
political changes should be made not just to provide representation for one 
group but to improve representation for everyone. Increasing the number of 
supervisors can be an important first step. 
</P>
<P>
This trial and the public discussion of the issues can be the impetus for 
requiring Los Angeles County to change its 19th-Century structure to one more 
democratic to meet the increasing challenges facing government in the 1990s and 
beyond

SOVIET UNION: AS THE SPECTER OF CIVIL WAR HAUNTS HIS COUNTRY, GORBACHEV IS PUT 
TO HIS BIGGEST TEST. HE IS LOSING, AND MOSCOW IS LOSING, AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT

"In the Soviet Union today the optimists study English, the pessimists study 
Chinese and the new realists study the Kalashnikov." 
</P>
<P>
That grim joke, which I heard in Moscow last week, reflects a growing pessimism 
among many Soviet citizens. It is one of a number of signs of the specter of 
civil war that is haunting the Soviet Union -- and not only in its southern 
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, where the danger of uncontrollable 
violence is more immediate. 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing demand in Moscow for the imposition of martial law in 
Azerbaijan, even though Mikhail Gorbachev has ruled out the use of force 
against the peaceful nationalist movements in the Baltic republics. That latter 
position has not gone unchallenged within the Communist Party Central 
Committee. If the Lithuanians were to go so far as to declare unilaterally that 
they had become an independent state, there is no guarantee that those in 
Moscow who favor restraint would continue to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The danger for the peoples of the Baltic republics -- and for Gorbachev -- 
could increase if unrest gets further out of hand in the Caucasus and 
elsewhere. It would fuel a growing sense of crisis, a concern among party 
conservatives and the military in particular that the Soviet Union is 
disintegrating and descending into anarchy. The same fear is increasingly being 
expressed by ordinary Russian citizens, whose dissatisfaction with the grim 
economic situation is also growing. 
</P>
<P>
Respect for Gorbachev remains high among the best-informed Soviet citizens -- 
in a large section of the intelligentsia and especially among those who work in 
research institutes dealing with the humanities, social sciences and 
international affairs. But his popularity has taken a serious tumble at a 
man-on-the-street level as well as within the powerful bureaucratic structures 
of the party and state. 
</P>
<P>
But even those who regard Gorbachev as the best Soviet leader available have 
come to wonder whether he has much chance of stemming a tide of events 
threatening to get out of control. If reason, dialogue and appeals for patience 
fail, there will be insistent demands for a return to more traditional methods 
of imposing control over a country that, it will be argued, is otherwise 
ungovernable. 
</P>
<P>
Not only Gorbachev but the Communist Party as a whole -- indeed, the party more 
than Gorbachev -- is losing authority in the Soviet Union. But in a country 
with little or no tradition of democratic government, it would be facile to 
assume that a multiparty system would offer a speedy solution to the major 
political problems, not to speak of the economic ones. For the time being, the 
best hope for reform is the continuation of the informal alliance between 
Gorbachev and his reformist allies in the upper echelons of the party, on the 
one hand, and the intelligentsia (both party and non-party members) on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Even that alliance is being challenged by a rising Russian nationalism. It 
could be put under further strain by workers' strikes if material conditions 
are no better this summer than they were in the summer past, when the Soviet 
Union was given its first foretaste of large-scale industrial unrest. To 
forestall that, and to buy time, the Soviet leadership has significantly 
increased import orders for consumer goods, an emergency tactic that Gorbachev 
rejected two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A party congress originally scheduled for February, 1991, is due to be held 
this October. But now there are demands from both wings of the Communist Party 
-- reformist and conservative -- for the date to be advanced still further. It 
is likely that when a crucial plenary session of the Central Committee takes 
place later this month, that issue will be one of the items on the agenda. Both 
"right" and "left" of the party are afraid that time is working against them, 
and that at least gives Gorbachev some room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
So far he has used every setback as a device for introducing more far-reaching 
political reforms. It is probable that this year will see Gorbachev concede a 
de facto federalization of the party (even though he may not wish to call it 
that) and to accept in principle a substantial devolution of power to the 
republics. The more radical reformers in Moscow's research institutes are 
suggesting that everything except defense and major foreign policy be handed 
over; they do not even exclude a limited foreign-policy role for the republics. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if Gorbachev will go that far and whether even such 
dramatic concessions would satisfy the Baltic republics in particular. They 
would not, in any event, provide an answer to the ethnic dispute between 
Armenians and Azeris, since part of the problem there is lack of agreement on 
their territorial republican boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Although problems are mounting faster than their solutions in today's Soviet 
Union, it is too early to write Gorbachev off, as many Western commentators are 
now doing. Though this month's Central Committee meeting will be perhaps the 
most difficult he has ever faced, he is likely to survive it with his 
leadership functions intact. Beyond that, he will be faced with the need to 
combine immediate crisis-management with longer-term measures of reform. To 
call it a dauntingly difficult task is an understatement. But I see no other 
Soviet leader on the horizon who would be likely to do it better.

MIX-UP RESETS CHRISTIAN-OLP GAME FOR JAN. 30 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Miscommunication postponed Friday night's league opener for the Christian High 
and Our Lady of Peace girls' basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The game has been rescheduled for 3 p.m. Jan. 30 at Christian. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Friday night Harbor league girls' games are played at 6 p.m., except 
those played at Christian. Because of the bad lighting in Christian's gym, 
which is also known as the bubble, games must be played in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Newly appointed OLP Coach Yvonne Sanchez was not notified of the change. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Christian) sent a letter but I never received it," Sanchez said. "It was 
around 3 and I was at home waiting to go to the 6 o'clock game and I got a 
phone call that the game was supposed to be at 3." 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Peace (10-3), which lost to USDHS, 48-41, in overtime last Tuesday, 
was "really fired-up to play," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good week of practice after the loss to University," Sanchez said. 
"It was a real letdown not to play." 
</P>
<P>
OLP is led by Tammy Tavarez, who is averaging 17.3 points a game, and April 
Velk, who is averaging 9.7. 
</P>
<P>
Christian (5-6) is led by sophomore Tiffany Stutz, who is averaging 21 points a 
game, senior Erika Jonte, 15 points a game and junior Stacey Patsko, who is 
averaging 13. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Conston is proving to be the Oceanside basketball team's everything 
player. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2 1/2 senior forward is averaging 18.9 points, 14.3 rebounds, 7 
blocks and 5.9 steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Oceanside Coach Jim Stant said that Conston was the second best 
player in the North County behind Vista's Chris Enger, who is now playing for 
the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This year with Enger gone, I believe she's the best," Stant said. "When you 
look at all she can do -- she can take the ball coast to coast, plays great 
defense, and can rebound the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Conston, who was an all-league center for three years, moved to forward this 
year because that's what "she'd be more likely to play in college," said Stant. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year starter is being recruited by San Diego State, Cal State 
Fullerton, UCLA, Cal State Long Beach and the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside, which finished third in the Avocado league last year, is leading the 
league with a 3-0, 11-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more talent but I've never had a team that played together like these 
kids do," Stant said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Waasted, El Capitan's defensive coordinator, was named the team's head 
coach. Waasted, an assistant for 14 years, takes over for Joe Rockhold who 
resigned at the end of the football season. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, El Capitan finished at the bottom of the Grossmont 3A League. 
</P>
<P>
Rockhold was the coach from 1972-1978 and again from 1982-1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay center Chris Smith's shoe size is more than his age. The 6-6, 
15-year-old sophomore wears a size 18 shoe. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty agile for his size," said Mission Bay Coach Mike Seaman. "He has 
good arm length and really gets his hands on the ball."

MANY SUPPLIERS RELIEVED BY NEWS OF CAMPEAU FILING

<P>
Steve Miska took no chances when Campeau Corp.'s retail divisions came through 
with $650,000 to pay bills last week on December shipments of Generra 
sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, we actually flew people in to pick up the checks and convert 
them into cashier's checks right there," said Miska, chairman and chief 
executive of Generra Sportswear Co. in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of bouncing checks and unpaid bills led some manufacturers to suspend 
shipments in November and December to Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. and 
Federated Department Stores Inc. subsidiaries, which were reeling under 
Campeau's crushing debt load. Allied and Federated operate such stores as 
Bloomingdale's in New York, Burdines in Florida and Lazarus in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
So it came as a huge relief for apparel makers and other suppliers when Allied 
and Federated filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
code Monday. Bankruptcy protection will allow the stores to reorganize their 
debt, hold off some creditors and arrange financing to pay bills and buy spring 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
For some suppliers, the bankruptcy filings meant that they could resume 
business as usual, going ahead with orders for apparel and merchandise to be 
shipped from now through March. The bankruptcy filing gives high priority to 
payment of bills for such shipments. 
</P>
<P>
But for other suppliers, the news meant more uncertainty -- and they vowed no 
shipments without cash on the barrel head. They worried about the details of 
the financing package and the priority for payments, and some suppliers even 
worried that the filing might compel Campeau banks not to honor checks issued 
last week to bring Allied and Federated accounts current. On Monday, no 
suppliers interviewed complained of bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
Before the filing, Campeau's predicament threw a chill on the retail business, 
some suppliers said. "Just going forward, people are going to be more cautious 
no matter who it is," said Michael Gould, president of Giorgio Beverly Hills, 
which ships fragrances to Allied and Federated stores. "We're not going to ship 
anything without guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "If you shipped anything in the last two months (to Federated 
or Allied stores), you were rolling the dice. The risk of rolling the dice now 
is substantially less than what it was." 
</P>
<P>
With the bankruptcy filing, Federated and Allied won approval from its banks 
for $700 million in financing to be used for operations, including paying bills 
and buying goods. 
</P>
<P>
That should go a long way toward repairing supplier relationships, analysts 
said. Campeau's financial straits had threatened to choke off Federated and 
Allied stores' supply lines at just the time they should be stocking up for the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until virtually this morning, before the bankruptcy filing, none of the 
suppliers were willing to ship fresh merchandise to the stores, and many of the 
stores where starting to be spotty in merchandise, particularly the Southern 
ones, where spring starts earlier," said retail consultant Kurt Barnard, 
publisher and president of Retail Marketing Report in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole cloud of uncertainty has now been erased," said Bernard Chaus, 
chairman of women's apparel maker Chaus Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Chaus stopped shipping in December. The manufacturer received a payment last 
Wednesday, when Campeau units made good on a reported $100 million in bills. 
Now, Chaus said that his company would resume shipments this week. "They still 
owe us money, and I guess that will be in the bankruptcy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was so trusting. Some suppliers, such as Miska and Jerome A. 
Chazen, chairman of Liz Claiborne Inc. in New York, said they would wait for 
more details on the stores' refinancing before deciding whether to resume 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Nelson, vice president for sales at New York clothing maker Harve 
Benard, said Benard would resume shipments that were suspended in November -- 
but on a cash basis only. The New York-based maker does about $15 million of 
business with Federated and Allied stores.

NCR Corp.: The Dayton, Ohio-based firm said its fiscal 1989 earnings fell 6% to 
$412 million as its revenue slipped 1% to $5.96 billion. The maker of business 
information processing systems said worldwide revenue recorded a gain when the 
impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in year-to-year comparisons is excluded. 
Higher investment in research and development, declines in revenue and gross 
margins, and a share-repurchase program contributed to the decrease in net 
income, the company said.

Czechs Want to Rejoin IMF, World Bank: Czechoslovakia applied to rejoin the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Czechoslovak news agency 
CTK said the application had been made in line with a decision by the new 
reformist government Dec. 21 as part of its policy to open the country to the 
world economy. Czechoslovakia quit the two agencies, of which it was a founder 
member, in 1954, after its 1948 takeover by the Communists.

First Chicago Corp.: The largest banking company in the Midwest posted fiscal 
1989 net income of $359 million, a drop of 30% from fiscal 1988, in part 
because of problems with loans to less developed countries. For the fourth 
quarter, the firm, which is the parent of First National Bank of Chicago, 
reported profit of $123 million, off 10% from the year-ago period. The quarter 
results were attributed to commercial non-performing assets, which increased by 
more than 30% to $592 million, largely because of problem real estate loans 
that it said were geographically dispersed.

Slowdown Prompts Apple to Cut Costs: Apple Computer Inc. announced cost-cutting 
measures in response to a business slowdown that has been more pronounced than 
the company and analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to employees, Apple Chairman John A. Sculley said the measures 
include a reduction in the number of staff through attrition, cutbacks in 
hiring and the transfer of some workers. Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur 
said demand for the company's computers has slowed not only in the United 
States but also overseas. She said revenue and profit for the fiscal first 
quarter, due to be announced later this week, did not reach original 
expectations.

Prices declined broadly on Wall Street on Monday as pessimism about the economy 
-- which sent stocks sharply lower on Friday -- took a further toll on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't see any reason to take an aggressive stand on the buy side," 
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said of traders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 19.84 to 2,669.37. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 4 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 395 stocks rising, 1,091 falling 
and 466 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled a moderate 140.59 million shares, down from 183.88 
million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the malaise that settled over Wall Street after two negative 
economic reports Friday remained in place Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bargain hunters who might normally enter the market after a sharp loss stayed 
on the sidelines Monday, said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co. Jarrett described traders as apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone company circuit failure halted delivery of markets data Monday from 
the New York and American stock exchanges to Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some of the stock tables compiled and transmitted by the AP were 
delayed and others did not reflect final closing prices for some stocks. 
</P>
<P>
AP said the outage appeared to be a local problem in New York and not related 
to widespread long-distance calling problems with American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices finished lower on the London Stock Exchange, although well above 
the day's lows. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 13.9 points to close 
2,366.2.

Campeau Filing Hits Junk Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond prices fell after a bankruptcy court filing by two Campeau Corp. 
units, whose financial troubles triggered the high-yield bond market's severe 
tailspin last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever that happens it is a disturbing event and it's a drag on the market 
and it was," said Robert Lupo, director of high-yield bond research at Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said issues of high-yield bonds on average fell about 1/4 point to 1/2 
point. The movement of a point equals a change of $10 on a $1,000 bond. The 
widely watched 13.71% RJR Holdings Capital Corp. bond due in 2009 was down 
about 7/8 point at 90 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores 
Corp. to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law drew a subdued reaction because it had been expected, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The government securities market was closed Monday. Prices of corporate and 
municipal bonds were slightly lower in quiet trading, said Eric Friedlander, a 
corporate bond trader with Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds was 92.875, down 3/32 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.30% 
from 7.29% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Gains in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against most major foreign currencies in light trading, as 
holidays in Japan and the United States sharply reduced worldwide activity. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid 
of $414.80 an ounce, up from $414.50 late Friday. On New York's Commodity 
Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $413.70 an ounce from 
$413.20 last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said trading activity was reduced due to the Martin Luther King Day 
holiday in the United States and a national holiday in Japan, both of which 
closed banks -- the biggest players in the world foreign-exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in Europe said the dollar's rise was fueled by a weakening of the West 
German mark against the Japanese yen and against the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
The mark was pushed lower by an initial drop in Frankfurt, West Germany, share 
prices that was sharper than many traders had expected following Friday's fall 
on Wall Street. The mark has derived support in recent months from foreign 
investor interest in West German shares. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Warm Weather Cools Oil Prices 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange as 
unseasonably warm weather spread across the country, easing demand for home 
heating fuel. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, orange juice futures ended mixed after soaring 
early in the session. Futures prices for precious metals, grains and soybeans, 
and livestock and meat also finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Most wholesale heating oil futures fell 1.85 to 2 cents, the permitted daily 
limit. The contract for delivery in February, on which the limit has been 
lifted pending its Jan. 31 expiration, crashed 5.05 cents to settle at 64.60 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil tumbled 22 to 77 cents 
with February at $22.36 a barrel; unleaded gasoline futures settled 1.14 to 1.5 
cents lower with February at 63.59 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The plunge in heating oil prices marked the first downturn in the February 
contract in a week. The selloff was largely a reaction to spring like weather 
in much of the northern United States, especially the populous Northeast, where 
record-breaking cold in December had spurred strong demand for heating oil and 
pushed prices up sharply.

Adolph Coors Co. has announced record beer sales for fiscal 1989, including a 
15% increase in sales of its Coors Light brand. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, the company's Coors Brewing Co. reported 
sales of 17.7 million barrels -- more than 1.1 million barrels, or 7% higher, 
than 1988's record sales. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments during the fourth quarter of 1989 also posted a record, increasing 
32% to 4.4 million barrels compared to the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with the strong performance of our brands in 1989, 
particularly Coors Light, which surpassed the 10-million-barrel mark before 
year-end," said Coors Brewing Co. President Peter H. Coors. 
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenal growth of more than 15% made Coors Light the fastest-growing 
premium light beer in America last year, and all indicators suggest that this 
trend continues."

SECURITY PACIFIC CRITICIZED FOR OPENING ON KING HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a public relations fiasco for Security Pacific 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Angry civil rights leaders protested the Los Angeles bank's decision to keep 
branches open on the day honoring the slain civil rights leader and vowed to 
take further action. They credited their protests, which included early morning 
picketing outside of the bank's Los Angeles headquarters, with forcing the bank 
to close some branches early in minority communities such as South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific was the only major bank in California to open its branches 
Monday. But some 20 of the bank's 557 branches statewide either did not open or 
closed early in areas where, as a Security Pacific spokeswoman said, "it became 
obvious that those communities would not support our decision to stay open." 
She did not identify the location of the branches, but did say two were on the 
route of a parade honoring King and would have been impractical to open anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to stay open on the King holiday stems from the larger retail war 
among California banks that escalated last year. Banks, feeling pressure to 
differentiate their service from the competition, are opening branches on 
Saturdays, Sundays, at night and on traditional bank holidays such as Columbus 
Day, Veterans Day and Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
This time it backfired. In addition to Security Pacific's troubles, an 
embarrassed Wells Fargo Bank last Friday decided to close its branches on 
Monday under pressure after declaring earlier in the week that they would be 
open. A bank spokeswoman said the decision came after the bank received 
hundreds of telephone calls at its headquarters and branches. 
</P>
<P>
The third Monday in January has been a national holiday honoring King since 
1986, even though surveys have shown that fewer than one in five employers 
nationwide give workers the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific defended its action to open branches, adding that 90% of its 
employees observed the holiday by taking the day off and that the bank's 
parent, Security Pacific Corp., was closed. The bank added that it opened 
branches only as a convenience to customers and that other retail businesses, 
such as departments stores, were opened as well. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the holiday with Wells Fargo and Security Pacific shows how 
sensitive banks are when it comes to their image with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason stems from an increasing number of challenges to bank 
mergers made by civil rights groups alleging that banks do not make enough 
loans or extend adequate credit in low-income areas. Those groups have been 
using the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which allows regulators to look at 
such policies when reviewing merger plans, to pressure banks into doing more. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a group of civil rights leaders accused Wells Fargo of failing 
to follow equal opportunity employment and lending practices, asking regulators 
to block the San Francisco bank's proposed acquisition of American National 
Bank. Wells Fargo denies the coalition's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
To help fight that image, large California banks such as Security Pacific 
recently formed a coalition to provide $100 million in loans to developers who 
build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But what clearly irked civil rights leaders is that Security Pacific has 
previously closed for the holiday. Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of 
the Los Angeles branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which 
King founded, notes that Security Pacific even specifies on the 1990 calendars 
it gives to customers that banks are closed in honor of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
He said civil rights groups plan to seek a commitment from Security Pacific to 
close in honor of the holiday in the future. He added that the dispute over the 
holiday will trigger a probe by the groups into the bank's equal opportunity 
policies toward lending and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific's spokeswoman Deborah Lewis said the bank's plans will be 
determined by what it believes will provide the best service for its customers.

MARKETING: FOR HOLLYWOOD AD AGENCIES, GETTING FIRED IS ALL PART OF SHOW 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

About all Jack Fiman can do is wait. 
</P>
<P>
His tiny Santa Monica agency, Martin &amp; Benedict Inc., has been purchasing 
commercial time for films made by Cannon Pictures since 1979. Fiman's firm, 
which employs just 12 people, has long relied on Cannon as its largest client. 
</P>
<P>
But Cannon -- which mostly makes C-grade action films such as "Penitentiary 
III" -- recently ran into financial troubles and underwent several management 
changes at the top. Along with those changes, the studio has put its estimated 
$20-million advertising account up for review. 
</P>
<P>
Fiman hopes -- and expects -- to hang on to his biggest client. But he has been 
around Hollywood long enough to know the score, and he isn't complaining about 
the review. "I understand why this happens," he said. "The film industry is a 
high-profile business and there's a lot of shuffling. When that happens, just 
about everyone goes up for review." 
</P>
<P>
But Cannon is just a very small piece of a very large picture. These days, it 
seems half of Hollywood is out looking for agencies to plan and purchase media 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Paramount Pictures ("Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Star Trek 
V -- The Final Frontier") fired the ad firm D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles 
from its $70-million account. And two weeks ago, the Tri-Star division of 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment ("Look Who's Talking," "Steel Magnolias") took 
its estimated $150-million spot TV media buying business away from AC&amp;R 
Advertising and handed it to McCann-Erickson. In November, 20th Century Fox 
Film Corp. ("War of the Roses," "Enemies, A Love Story") said it was taking its 
estimated $30-million network business away from the J. Walter Thompson agency 
and planned to purchase the media time itself. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon, which is not expected to name its agency until February, refused to 
discuss specifically its review. But Cannon executives were willing to talk 
generally about why studios seem to change agencies so often. "The marketing 
task in this industry is enormously complicated," said Allan Freeman, senior 
executive vice president of marketing at Cannon. "Introducing a new movie isn't 
like introducing a new brand of dog food. When you bring a new dog food on the 
market, you don't have 400 people around the country writing a critique on it 
that weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Some major film studios seem to change agencies almost as often as the movie 
theaters change the film titles on their marquees. But why are so many 
Hollywood studios prowling around for new agencies right now? 
</P>
<P>
"When you have changes in management, the new people often like to bring in 
their own teams," said Miles Turpin, chairman of the Western division of Grey 
Advertising, which purchases media time for Warner Bros., the studio that 
brought "Batman" to the screen last year. "Keep in mind, this was a fairly soft 
Christmas. A lot of films didn't live up to expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that won't stop agencies from chasing after film studio accounts. 
After all, of the estimated $4 billion spent annually on advertising in 
Southern California, an estimated $1 billion of that is spent on film 
advertising. A studio will commonly spend as much as $10 million hyping a 
single major release. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're an advertising agency in Los Angeles, you're not going to have 
critical mass unless you have an entertainment or (Asian) automotive account," 
said James Agnew, executive vice president and general manager of the Los 
Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson. "It would be like being in Detroit and 
not having an auto account." Although Thompson recently lost Fox as a client, 
it still purchases media for Universal Television. 
</P>
<P>
One film executive says marketing a film can be a no-win situation for a 
studio's marketing department. "If a movie is a big success, people often say 
it's because the film was good and it was booked into the right theaters," said 
Barry Lorie, senior vice president of marketing at MGM/UA. "But if a movie 
fails, the marketing department gets the blame because people say the ads were 
lousy." 
</P>
<P>
One key measure of success in the film industry is box office market share. 
Paramount, which ranked No. 1 in box office share in 1987 and second in 1988, 
fell to fifth last year. It should be no surprise then that Paramount brought 
in a new marketing chief -- who last week fired the studio's agency, D'Arcy. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising a new film is like being asked to successfully introduce a new 
product in one week," said James Helin, managing director of Paramount's former 
agency, D'Arcy's Los Angeles office. "That's a very difficult thing to do." In 
the film business, that first week -- if not the first 72 hours -- is often 
critical to the failure or success of a film. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the giant crapshoot of all time," said MGM's Lorie. "And it attracts the 
best crapshooters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo Advertising Wins Suzuki's L.A. Dealers 
</P>
<P>
It isn't exactly sweet revenge -- but for all of its work, at least the Los 
Angeles office of Hakuhodo Advertising didn't come out empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it won the estimated $600,000 account of the Greater Los Angeles 
Suzuki Dealers Assn. That win comes just a few months after the agency finished 
second in the running for Suzuki's estimated $20-million national automotive ad 
business. That account was won by Asher/Gould Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"When we didn't get the national business, we decided to continue pursing the 
dealers' associations," said David Parmenter, vice president and management 
director at Hakuhodo. The agency is also doing some creative projects for 
Suzuki dealer associations in San Diego and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
With good work for the dealer associations, Hakuhodo hopes it can land the 
national account eventually. Sure, Suzuki has only a few models right now. But, 
joked Parmenter, "We think Suzuki's saving us for their luxury division." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zacky Switches Firms but Not Spokeswomen 
</P>
<P>
A new agency is under wing, but popular spokeswoman Lillian Zacky will continue 
to crow about Zacky Farms' chicken in radio commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the El Monte company -- which sells about 1 million chickens every 
month -- handed its estimated $2-million creative account to Italia &amp; 
Associates in Los Angeles. Western International Media will continue to handle 
media buying. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Zacky has mostly relied on free-lancers to create the folksy radio 
ads that for more than a year have featured Lillian Zacky, wife of company 
President Robert Zacky. In the ads, Lillian Zacky often talks about her 
fictionalized attempts at the grocery store to get people to buy Zacky Farms 
brand chicken. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to food shows, many people tell me they buy Zacky chicken because of 
the commercials," said Lillian Zacky. Some people have even begun to ask for 
her autograph. "Can you imagine that?" she said. "I'm flattered." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creators May Buy Back Stake in Growing Firm 
</P>
<P>
Controlling interest in a fast-growing Los Angeles agency may be repurchased by 
its local management within the next year. The two namesakes of the firm 
Kresser-Craig, which creates ads for Atlantic Richfield Co., are negotiating 
with giant Omnicom Co. to repurchase the one-third interest in the agency that 
they sold to Omnicom just five years ago. The two men already own a one-third 
interest between them. The remaining one-third is owned by Japanese ad firm 
Dai-Ichi Kikaku. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussions have been too informal to even be news," said Robert Kresser, 
chairman of the agency. But Jean Craig, the agency's president and creative 
director, said the deal could be completed within the next year. Why buy back 
the one-third interest? Replied Craig, whose agency has increased its billings 
to $80 million from about $20 million over the past five years: "We're doing 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suissa Returns to Puns for Sports Connection Account 
</P>
<P>
If an ad campaign appeared to work well for a former client, is it OK to use 
virtually the same campaign for a new client? 
</P>
<P>
David Suissa seems to think so. Last year, his Santa Monica agency, Suissa 
&amp; Associates, created those pun-filled billboards for the Marie Callender's 
Family Restaurant chain. The billboards had short snappy sayings like "Yankee 
Noodle Dandy." Suissa's agency lost the restaurant chain's account late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Suissa recently picked up the $2.5-million Sports Connection ad business. 
And last week, Sports Connection billboards began to appear with this saying: 
"Happy New Rear." 
</P>
<P>
Is Suissa just rehashing an old campaign for a new client? "We put our egos 
aside," said Suissa. "The thing that counts is whether or not a campaign works. 
I don't mind criticism if I'm building my client's business."

L.A. CELEBRATES KING'S CAUSE AT PARADES, RALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES and JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They marched Monday -- through the streets of South Los Angeles, down the 
boulevards of Beverly Hills, even to a small church in Inglewood -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been King's 61st birthday, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the Los Angeles 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
America and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, wound down King Boulevard and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
Russia," said a smiling Ivan Jones, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from Martin Luther King. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said Keith Strong, 36, referring to Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the 
newly inaugurated governor of Virginia. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what Martin Luther King was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for Dr. King and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said Margie Manyweather, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. Gina Temple, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only King's birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said Donyielle Holley, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor Tom Bradley rang the City Hall bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of Security Pacific National Bank's downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that Security Pacific stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said Susan Anderson of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of Security 
Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Toni Morrison gave the keynote speech at the 
SCLC's 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Dinner at the Bonaventure.

CALTRANS' DIRT MOUNTAIN IS NOTHING BUT HEAP OF TROUBLE FOR NEIGHBORING CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unwanted mountain, crisscrossed by dirt-bike trails and littered with trash 
and old tires, rises up out of South-Central Los Angeles, sprawling across 
several hundred empty acres of state-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
It is literally a mountain of dirt. And over the last 15 years or so, it and 
the open fields around it have become an illegal playground for motorbikes and 
other off-road vehicle users, as well as a place to dump rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
This land south of Imperial Highway, between Normandie and Western avenues, was 
cleared for the $2-billion Century Freeway project. 
</P>
<P>
The state got the mountain free because California Department of Transportation 
engineers thought they were going to need fill dirt on the freeway project. So, 
when Southwest College was built at Imperial and Western, the state asked for 
the dirt excavated from the campus building site. They got it, all 150,000 to 
200,000 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
Now Caltrans has decided it no longer needs the dirt, and the future of the 
mountain is uncertain, according to Paul In, a Caltrans engineer. At first the 
state was going to run the freeway right through where the mountain now stands, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our original alignment took the dirt out," In explained. However, Caltrans is 
now looking for ways to cut costs and leaving the dirt in place may be one way 
to save money, he said. It could be cheaper to reroute the highway around the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
That news doesn't make Father David O'Connell happy, not one bit. O'Connell, a 
normally cheery Irishman, gets angry when he talks about the mountain and its 
impact on St. Frances X Cabrini Catholic Church and parish school. 
</P>
<P>
The church and school are in the shadow of the mountain and, day in and day 
out, the motorbikes snarling up and down makeshift trails make it hard to teach 
the children and conduct Mass, the priest has told state officials. He wants 
the noise abated by a wall or screen of trees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the exploding gopher populations that are migrating from the dirt 
mountain into the Cabrini baseball diamond have ruined the field, O'Connell 
said. There are 300 students enrolled in the elementary school, but no ball 
field to play on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to have a place for the children to play, but we can't do it, not 
with all of this," O'Connell said as he gestured toward the abandoned field 
pocked by gopher holes. "And that isn't all, they use that mountain for a 
dump," he added, pointing to refuse, piles of old tires and other debris 
directly behind the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing that concerns us is that they've found hazardous wastes under 
the mountain," O'Connell said. He is concerned that toxic waste from an old 
dump may be kicked up in the dust clouds if and when the mountain is finally 
hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
As O'Connell talked about his concerns recently, a pickup truck drove up one of 
the mountain's muddy, makeshift roads and two young men unloaded a four-wheel 
all-terrain vehicle. They had come out for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming here since I was 9 or 10," Rocky Baggett, 23, yelled over the 
roar of the engine. The Carson resident said he comes here often, adding: "It's 
a real popular place to ride." With that he zoomed up the hill and out of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted with the priest's complaints, Caltrans officials agree only 
that the mountain belongs to the state. They are reluctant to say that it is 
causing problems. But they also are looking into O'Connell's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"We are studying what to do," said Caltrans Deputy District Director Conrad 
Barber. Efforts have been made to chase away the gophers but he conceded they 
"haven't been too successful." 
</P>
<P>
As for the dirt bikes that flock to the area on weekends, Caltrans spokesman In 
said, "That's a law enforcement problem. It's difficult to keep (the dirt 
bikers) out." 
</P>
<P>
The area is posted and it's against the law to trespass or dump refuse in the 
area, state police officials said. However, they don't have the manpower or 
equipment to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty over the route and at what level the freeway will be built 
through the area means that no decisions can be made yet on the dirt mountain, 
In said. As for the toxic waste, he said the site was an unauthorized dump 
before Caltrans bought it and does contain "heavy metals." No decision has been 
made on how this problem is to be handled, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS HEARING ON CITYHOOD UNTIL JAN. 
31 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge has postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed by Malibu 
cityhood supporters, who want to force the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to set a date for an incorporation election in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, who was to have heard final arguments in 
the case today, postponed the hearing at the request of lawyers for a cityhood 
opponent who said they needed more time to prepare their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation backers have accused the supervisors of violating a state law 
that allows them 60 days from when they begin hearing the cityhood matter to 
conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election. The 
supervisors began the hearing Oct. 19, but later voted to postpone indefinitely 
a decision on incorporation until construction permits are issued for a sewer 
system the county wants built in Malibu.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'THE REFRIGERATOR' IS SOUGHT IN BANK 
HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A heavyset man whom authorities have dubbed "The Refrigerator" is being sought 
as a suspect in more than a dozen bank robberies, Los Angeles police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who is about 5-feet-7 and weighs between 200 and 230 pounds, 
apparently began committing his crimes in September and is believed to have 
struck banks in Hollywood, Los Feliz, Eagle Rock, Wilshire and the Mid-City 
areas, Detective Jim Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who is between 35 and 45 years old, has dirty blond hair, possibly 
slightly graying, blue eyes and is clean-shaven. He also is believed to have 
held up banks in Alhambra, Pasadena and Glendale.

No one has been hurt in any of the robberies, though several tellers told 
police they saw a gun in the man's possession.

SOME WORKERS MUST MARK THE HOLIDAY ON THEIR OWN TIME

Early Monday morning Zack Harmon called his workplace to say he would be out 
sick. Hours later, though, Harmon appeared to be in suspiciously good health. 
He stood with his 2-year-old son perched upon his shoulder and watched the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade flow down King Boulevard in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Like Harmon, many Los Angeles workers and students were forced to feign illness 
or expend vacation days or accumulated time off Monday in order to participate 
in the observance of what would have been the civil rights leader's 61st 
birthday. Though the third Monday in January was designated a federal holiday 
honoring King in 1986, many offices and some private schools still remained 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon echoed the sentiments of other absentees who could be found along the 
parade route when he explained his decision not to report to work. It is 
important, he said, to commemorate a man and a movement that "changed the face 
of the whole nation. That's why I'm here and that's why he's here," he said, 
indicating his son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a financial analyst, said calling in sick was the only way he could get 
the day off, and that his employers were aware of the ruse and accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I was sick, but they know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said their bosses are less benign. They described personal battles to 
persuade school officials and employees to recognize the day. 
</P>
<P>
M. Jeremy McCauley, an analyst at McDonnell Douglas, said he was was appalled 
when he read the latest company newsletter. Across the top ran a line in bold 
print informing employees that Jan. 15 was to be "a regular working day." 
</P>
<P>
"I was burned up by that," he said. "The inference is that it is not as 
deserving as any other holiday . . . enough so that they put it in the 
newsletter." 
</P>
<P>
To observe the day, McCauley would have had to use a vacation day, a sick day 
or a personal day. He decided to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's no big deal. It's no special day and I don't understand that. It 
shows little respect or concern for Dr. King." 
</P>
<P>
Incensed, McCauley already has begun writing a letter to the company newspaper 
detailing his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hanson, spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said company holidays are 
negotiated with the union. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has 13 holidays a year and King Day is not one of those that they 
chose to put in, at least not so far," he said. Hanson also noted that many 
company holidays have been consolidated so employees have a week off from 
Christmas through New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have given employees the option of using a floating holiday to 
observe the day. Barbara Hughes, an employee at Warner Brothers, used a 
floating holiday to observe King Day. But Hughes feels that is a way of 
sidestepping the issue. Going to the parade was her way of "making a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to maybe show management that we as employees at Warner Brothers should 
have (King Day) as a holiday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Friedman, company spokesman, said King Day was not a union holiday, so the 
studios were open. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Brummell, a sales clerk at Sears, used a personal day off she had saved. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave his life, so I can at least take one day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To Elimu Kiongozi, an aerospace employee who could be found at work Monday, the 
sanctioning of the holiday by schools and officials is less important than 
African-Americans acknowledging the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We should just take the day off whether The Man is going to let us or not . . 
. even if it costs us," said Kiongozi, adding that other leaders like Malcolm X 
and Marcus Garvey should have days of commemoration in the African-American 
community as well. 
</P>
<P>
While the holiday was observed by public schools and universities, some 
students of private schools found themselves engaged in the controversy over 
observing the day. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at Occidental College, classes were held Monday, but many of the 
school's students chose to attend an anti-apartheid rally at the South African 
Consulate as a way of observing King's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
A candlelight vigil was held Monday night as the students' first organized 
attempt to convince the administration that the day should be a school holiday. 
Frances Hill, the school's news director, said Occidental is on the quarter 
system and does not observe other holidays such as President's Day. The 
school's administration is sympathetic to the request of students to observe 
the day, she added.

RAMS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a world devoid of San Francisco 49ers, the Rams might be kings. They threw 
their best stuff at the league in 1989, won 13 games, christened a star 
quarterback, played with passion and purpose, and made everyone gather around 
the tube to watch reruns of Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no blue ribbons. The 49ers have extended grief upon the Rams into a new 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Losing a championship game is difficult enough. The Rams know, having lost nine 
of 12 over the years. But losing to your divisional rival is unbearable. Still, 
the Rams stood and took it honorably after Sunday's 30-3 loss, biting their 
tongues to suppress what had to be an excruciating frustration. 
</P>
<P>
What legal act, exactly, aligned these divisions in the first place, and what's 
to keep a team from jumping ship? If an owner can move a franchise out of town 
in the dead of night, why can't the Rams fudge up their letterhead a bit and 
announce a new alliance with the AFC West? 
</P>
<P>
Can a franchise talk out loud here? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have averaged 9.6 victories a season under Coach John Robinson since 
1983, and have to show for it one lonely divisional banner to run up the 
flagpole each morning. The Rams will always have 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, a spirited team with an infectious collegiate flavor, never wanted 
the 1989 season to end, much less skid to a halt as it did in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a roller-coaster," safety Vince Newsome said. "It's been one of the 
oddest years, and the only way to see any good out of it would have been to be 
in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, a relative veteran among kids who turns 29 next week, has maybe seen 
his best chance slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Flipper Anderson, who burst from nowhere in training camp to 
national acclaim in November, can't wait for July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big loss," he said after Sunday's game. "But we know what kind of team 
we have. Our spirits are down because of the loss, but we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Rams count the days until Joe Montana's going-away party. 
But 1989, for all its crazy comebacks and memories, is done. Robinson explains 
that a football team dies at the end of each season and must be reborn the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Rams were buried in Candlestick Park. A new season will be bring 
change. You'll miss some familiar faces and won't recognize others. 
</P>
<P>
Some names to look for in coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett. One skittish championship game-performance does not a season make. 
Everett came of age in 1989, leading the Rams through nine nerve-racking 
finishes, winning six. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will soon reward Everett with a new long-term contract, probably five 
years in the $2-million-a-season range. The deal will be completed before Feb. 
1, when Everett technically becomes a free agent. Vice President John Shaw and 
Everett's agent, Marvin Demoff, have been quietly working on the deal since 
August, and risking Everett to a free-agent offer sheet was never an option for 
the Rams or Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations say the deal will be announced at a news 
conference soon, but there's a "90%" chance it won't happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin. He was 10 years of laughs and one of the most flamboyant Rams 
ever, but his career is apparently over, at least in Anaheim. Irvin, a two-time 
Pro Bowl selection at right cornerback, suggested he would retire after 
Sunday's loss. That may become official on Feb. 1, when the Rams must protect 
37 players and leave the rest for Plan B free agency. Irvin, sources say, won't 
be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Slater. The 14-year veteran right tackle made the Pro Bowl for the sixth 
time in 1989, but Sunday's loss choked him up so much he said he's considering 
retirement. Don't expect it to happen. Robinson thinks Slater, 35, can play two 
more seasons. For that reason, the Rams are expected to protect him. Great 
tackles, even aging ones, are difficult to find. Look for Slater to return for 
his 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green. What's a team to do with a first-round pick who hasn't played in 
two years? Green finished the season on injured reserve so the Rams could 
activate Paul Butcher, a free-agent special teams monster, for a playoff game 
against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was the 14th pick of 1988, though, the Rams will likely protect 
Green from free agency, figuring some team will surely take a chance with the 
former UCLA star. The trading season opens again Feb. 5, but Green hasn't shown 
enough to command much in market value. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone need a low-mileage tailback with great speed and questionable desire? 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur. The Rams' defensive coordinator since 1983, Shurmur brought the 
league innovations such as the Eagle defense -- five linebackers, two down 
linemen -- and this year's four-linebacker rushing unit. Shurmur gained 
national attention when he out-foxed Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan in the 
wild-card game. It might have been enough to get the 57-year-old Shurmur a 
crack at the Phoenix Cardinals' coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
It would take the Rams more than a phone call or two to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ONCE AROUND THE ROSTER IN 1990 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE: Don't touch that dial. The unit is set for the next five years, so 
long as tackle Robert Cox can step in for Slater in two years and line coach 
Hudson Houck can develop a few young projects to protect against age. Left 
tackle Irv Pankey turns 32 next season and center Doug Smith is 33. Smith made 
the Pro Bowl in 1989, and Pankey would have been in a few by now were it not 
for Slater, who keeps stealing votes on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says he's going to abandon his one-back offense in favor of a two-back 
set to better utilize underworked backs Robert Delpino and Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
But tailback Greg Bell isn't exactly over the hill. The man the experts claimed 
couldn't put good seasons back to back just finished his second consecutive 
1,000-yard rushing season and his third in a six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an afterthought in the Eric Dickerson trade of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Bell doesn't turn 28 until August. Any more dwarf jokes? 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: Want six good reasons the Rams had no chance of stopping the 49ers 
Sunday? Mike Piel, Bill Hawkins, Clifford Hicks, Anthony Newman, Doug Reed and 
Newsome. All missed the championship game because of injuries. Piel started at 
right defensive end but re-dislocated his left elbow in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When sound, the Rams' defense isn't as defenseless as it appeared Sunday when 
Montana brushed up on some of his patterns. It probably wouldn't have finished 
21st overall for the season, either. The pieces are there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, changes beckon in 1990. Robinson swears he's finally going to move Jerry 
Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl selection at left cornerback, back to his natural 
position, free safety. But can he afford to if Irvin retires and Hicks, his 
heir apparent, can't return from major reconstructive knee surgery? That would 
leave Darryl Henley and Alfred Jackson as starting cornerbacks in the same 
division with Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
One option is drafting a cornerback this spring, or moving Newman to one of the 
open spots. 
</P>
<P>
Piel kept getting better at defensive end, and first-pick Hawkins had emerged 
as a solid player when he was lost for the season Dec. 11 with a knee injury 
that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
One objective for next season is getting linebacker Frank Stams more action. 
The former Notre Dame star volunteered to move to inside linebacker when Fred 
Strickland and Larry Kelm went down in training camp. Stams was thrown to the 
wolves, then disappeared when Strickland and Kelm returned, proving it takes 
more than five minutes to learn a new position in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TEAMS: Dale Hatcher, who made the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 1985, may 
have punted his way to Plan B free agency with his woeful 38.8 average in 1989. 
Kicker Mike Lansford remained one of the NFL's best clutch kickers. If he ever 
improves his kickoffs, he'll make a Pro Bowl before he's through. 
</P>
<P>
No question, the Rams made waves in 1989. Their fourth-quarter comebacks gave 
them unique character and a soul. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our football team," Robinson said. "I think we played our hearts 
out throughout the year." 
</P>
<P>
They made it all the way to the Final Four. Flipper Anderson, an understudy 
turned superstar, says the Rams will be back in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Think the 49ers will show? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been held without a touchdown in their last three NFC title 
games, dating back to a 9-0 victory over Tampa Bay in the championship game of 
1979. The Rams used three field goals to win that game. They were defeated by 
the Chicago Bears in 1985, 24-0, and by the 49ers on Sunday, 30-3.

REEVES UNFAZED BY OWNER'S OPTIMISM

<P>
The Dawgs are dead, long live the underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the Broncos, favored to lose to the San Francisco 49ers by 11 1/2 
points, with the spread still climbing. It's already the biggest since 1970, 
when the Minnesota Vikings were 12-point picks over Kansas City -- and lost. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, after the Broncos' 37-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns, there 
was a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to win it," Bronco owner Pat Bowlen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do I think that? Maybe I'm the eternal optimist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, those guys have a great owner (Eddie DeBartolo Jr.). They've got 
God for a quarterback (Joe Montana). 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a bunch of palookas from the mountains. With funny orange jerseys. 
So maybe we've got a chance. We're going to sneak up on them." 
</P>
<P>
So if the Broncos won, it wouldn't be an upset? 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, no," Bowlen said. "I think it'd be an upset if we lost." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen, an avid bicyclist who goes at it hard enough to have broken his 
collarbone in a fall, also said he expects to win the Super Bowl every year. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not from around here, you don't know me," Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hurt your head when you fell off the bike?" asked a Colorado newsman. 
</P>
<P>
Exuberance, however, waned at Coach Dan Reeves' news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves painted a fearsome picture of the 49ers, which seemed wholely justified 
by their recent performances. 
</P>
<P>
Did Reeves have any brash Joe Namath-types, who might predict victory? 
</P>
<P>
"If we do, they better do it silently," Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, your owner just did," someone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said, he can say anything he wants to," Reeves said without missing a 
beat, drawing laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't guarantee it, did he?" Reeves asked 
</P>
<P>
No, Bowlen hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
"What time was this last night?" Reeves asked. 
</P>
<P>
He was told it had been at 11 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still celebrating," said Reeves, laughing. "He and Eddie (DeBartolo) 
don't play. They can say anything they like." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said the Broncos must keep the ball away from the 49er offense and keep 
the game from becoming a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
But rookie halfback Bobby Humphrey, who embodies the Bronco running attack, has 
two "cracked" ribs, the result of being hit in the chest slightly above his 
flak jacket by Brown cornerback Frank Minnifield's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said that Humphrey's availability won't be known until the Broncos start 
practice in New Orleans on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Cracked in this case is a euphemism for fractured. 
</P>
<P>
"Fractured means it's cracked through," Reeves said, smiling wryly. "Cracked 
means it's just partially . . . fractured." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey didn't play in Sunday's second half. Sammy Winder scored two 
touchdowns in his place but his rushing totals were 21 carries, 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco tight end Pat Kelly underwent knee surgery Monday and will not play. 
Kelly started Sunday in place of Clarence Kay, who had a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
Kay was in for two plays Sunday and expects to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco safety Dennis Smith calls his old USC teammate, 49er safety Ronnie Lott, 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him Saturday night," Smith said. "It was something we always 
talked about, playing against each other in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted them, now we got them. Now what are we going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Here's a statistic you're sure to see every hour on the hour: 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have won their last four regular-season meetings with the 49ers -- 
38-28 in 1979, 24-21 in '82, 17-16 in '85, 16-13 in '88. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't lost to the 49ers since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Counting exhibition meetings, the Broncos are 9-1 against the 49ers since 1979, 
suffering the lone loss before this season. In that exhibition, John Elway was 
held out because he left his knee brace at home. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, who has been a player, assistant or head coach in seven previous Super 
Bowls, brought his seven rings in Saturday to show his players. Monday, Reeves 
brought the rings to his news conference too. 
</P>
<P>
Later, John Elway was asked if the rings had motivated the players. 
</P>
<P>
"He might have gotten the young players," Elway said, smiling. "But this is the 
third time I've seen them, so . . . "

HUNTING: GENEROUS LIMITS, WARM WEATHER AND PRIVACY MAKE NORTHERN MEXICO A HAVEN 
FOR AMERICAN DUCK HUNTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CIUDAD OBREGON, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wake-up call comes at 4 a.m., and by 6:40, after more than 30 miles of dirt 
roads and a few more miles by air boat, the duck hunters are in their blind on 
Lobos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Missildine, who has a shooting school at Sea Island, Ga., says, "Good 
wind." 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect," says Jack Jansma, a charter fishing-boat operator from Grand Rapids, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The wind is from the west, behind the hunters, so the ducks, which land into 
the wind, will hear the calls, see the decoys and fly straight into the guns, 
out of the rising sun. 
</P>
<P>
And here they come. 
</P>
<P>
As they circle for their approach, Jansma notes that several are mergansers, 
"less of a quality duck," he says. "Teals are much better table fare." 
</P>
<P>
Missildine jokes that he is not so particular: "If it flies, it dies." 
</P>
<P>
But he, too, is selective. In Mexico, one can afford to be. There are no other 
hunters on the bay. They have thousands of ducks to themselves. They start 
shooting at 6:46. At 8, outfitter-guide Frank Ruiz comes back in the air boat 
to see how they're doing and collects 21 dead ducks drifting across the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"You can shoot 30 (altogether)," Ruiz says. "I'll be back in a little while." 
</P>
<P>
Missildine settles back into the blind. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time I've ever heard anyone mention a limit in Mexico," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BETTER ALL AROUND 
</P>
<P>
More ducks. That is the primary reason some American duck hunters have 
preferred to hunt in Mexico over the past decade. The limit is 15 a day, 45 in 
possession. Compared to the ever-shrinking limits of four along the Pacific 
Flyway and three on the continent's other three flyways, the Mexican limit is 
quite liberal -- and, in some cases, loosely observed. 
</P>
<P>
The season is about two months longer, until March 10. The last California 
season closed Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is better. In Mexico it's not necessary to be cold, wet and 
miserable to be a duck hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, hunters can use lead shot anywhere, whereas in most areas of the 
United States they are restricted to less-effective steel shot. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Number 1 reason is, I get to shoot a lot," Missildine said. "I'd be 
happy at home with 10 ducks, but I'm not going to pay $400 to go to Arkansas to 
shoot three ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, you don't have the pressure here we have in the States. Back home, every 
creek I go in, there's somebody hunting. You don't have any privacy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In California, according to the Department of Fish and Game, the sale of duck 
stamps decreased from 123,376 in 1979 to 79,381 in '88. Most of the duck 
hunting is at private clubs, about one-fourth on state-controlled refuges 
limited to three days a week and an insignificant amount on what few public 
wetlands have been spared by drought and development. Some hunters don't like 
to be regimented, so they go to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, Jansma said, "We figure duck hunting has gone down by almost 50%. 
The dedicated guys are still coming out, but it's disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Missildine is a crusty, lifelong hunter who has gone after ducks and doves all 
over North, South and Central America, sometimes a step ahead of or behind a 
revolution. He is a nonstop talker whose corny jokes fill the brief gaps 
between incoming flights of birds. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, he said, is "where two guys got on the bus with machine guns -- 
teen-agers -- just before the trouble broke out. That's why I quit going 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Missildine hunted in northern Rhodesia -- now Zimbabwe -- while a civil war was 
boiling in southern Rhodesia. In other parts of Africa, he said, "I shot 
everything," from lions to cape buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like to shoot most is what I'm hunting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MORE THE MERRIER 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is ducks, and there are more available than can be found on most 
traditional wetlands north of the border these days. That is why Missildine and 
Jansma have been organizing groups of hunters from their areas to come to 
Mexico for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my people are middle class, who work all year and save their money to 
come down here once a year," Missildine said. "It's worth it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz is in his second year as an outfitter with his Gabino's Yaqui Valley 
Hunting operation. He books duck-hunting packages through Jeri Booth's The 
Detail Company in Houston. They range from $880 to $1,365, including room and 
board but not air fare, and the more expensive trips include dove hunting as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
One misconception about duck hunting in Mexico is that the Mexicans are 
slaughtering so many ducks, there are few left to migrate north to breed in the 
spring -- hence the severe decline in duck hunting in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Collins, a regional field biologist for the Western Regional office of Ducks 
Unlimited in Sacramento, said: "That's not true. I've heard that for years and 
years. You won't even find any Mexicans hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any violation of the law, it's Americans that are going down there 
and maybe over-bagging. But the Mexican take is really insignificant for North 
America. About 75% of the harvested birds are U.S. birds. Canada gets like 12%, 
and the remainder is Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard from anyone that they thought over-bagging -- taking too many 
birds in Mexico -- was (a factor) . . . although there are some poor sportsmen 
that go down there and give a poor name to it." 
</P>
<P>
Jansma said: "Some people may have the idea to come down here and shoot the 
hell out of the resource . . . do everything you can't do up north. But no 
sportsman that I know is that way." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decline, according to Collins, is the result of a loss of nesting 
water and good nesting cover in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pacific Flyway always has a comfortable, healthy number of birds, although 
we are affected by the continuing drought in Canada," Collins said. "It's been 
going on for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"Where Mexico does need assistance . . . it's such a poor nation that they've 
got wetlands areas they could do so much with but they don't have the money to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FINALLY, COOPERATION 
</P>
<P>
A cooperative program among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ducks Unlimited 
Mexico (DUMAC) and SEDUE -- Mexico's government wildlife service -- might help. 
</P>
<P>
The North American Waterfowl Management Plan is a 15-year, $1.5-billion 
agreement designed to restore the continent's waterfowl populations through 
conservation of 6 million acres of key breeding, migration and wintering 
habitat, which now is being destroyed at the rate of 450,000 acres a year. The 
money may be spent in the United States, Canada or Mexico -- a major 
breakthrough since previous law prohibited spending federal money on habitat 
projects in other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kramer of the USFWS, manager of the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, 
is the technical adviser to the plan for his organization. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said: "The fallacy is that the Mexicans are killing all our ducks. The 
reality is that it's very difficult to own a firearm in Mexico because of very 
stringent gun-control laws. It's much easier for us to get a hunting permit in 
Mexico than it is for a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to belong to a hunting club (and) it's very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, nearly all of the ducks shot in Mexico are shot by Americans, who hunt in 
the marshes of the northern states of Baja California, Sonora -- where Ciudad 
Obregon is located -- and Sinaloa, along the Gulf of California. Kramer, who 
has been studying Mexican waterfowl for 15 years, estimates that 40% of the 
ducks are taken in Sinaloa. 
</P>
<P>
"In all cases, we found that 93% to 99% of the hunters were from the U.S., with 
the majority from California, Texas and Arizona," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are permitted to bring back up to 45 ducks each, but there is no 
telling how many more are given to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer has persuaded 14 club operators in Sinaloa to provide accurate 
information for the study. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is find out how many ducks are killed and how many 
hunters there are," he said. "Nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as duck populations started to decline, as they have in the last five 
years -- primarily due to drought conditions in Canada -- the easiest thing for 
anybody to do was to point the finger somewhere else. I've heard it a thousand 
times: 'The reason our ducks are in such bad shape is they're going to Mexico 
and getting slaughtered.' 
</P>
<P>
"My gut reaction -- prior to data but after years of experience -- from a 
biological perspective (is that) the total number harvested is relatively low. 
I'll bet in the whole country of Mexico in a four-month season there are fewer 
ducks killed than in the U.S. in the first few days of the season. But I don't 
want to prejudge the study." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ruiz and others indicate that although the limit is high, with 
enforcement low, only a minority of hunters abuse it. Most are willing to stop 
at 15 -- or aren't good enough shots to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Ducks do well in Mexico, Kramer said, because "the habitat loss along the West 
Coast of Mexico has been very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some areas created and enhanced by the development of 
agricultural areas. When things become irrigated, there is always runoff to the 
coast, and along the way they overflow a ditch and create a marsh. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, with the advent of rice, which they started planting after World War II, 
there are some additional food sources down there for the birds." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, a longtime guide, is one of only three outfitters in Ciudad Obregon. The 
three share dove-hunting areas but have exclusive rights to their duck-hunting 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, who spent three years at the St. Catherine's Military Academy in Anaheim, 
is working hard to develop American trade. 
</P>
<P>
He recently bought a 15-passenger, air-conditioned van, uses two-way radios 
with a 50-mile range to keep in touch with his guides and the office from the 
field, and not only serves as outfitter and guide but also as chauffeur and 
breakfast, lunch and dinner host. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a knock on your door at 3 a.m., it's probably Ruiz, raring to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up at 3 a.m. every day during hunting season," he said. "That's 145 days 
a year. If I'm not hunting, I'm scouting." 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Ruiz hired a plane to scout areas near here and found thousands 
of ducks in Lobos Bay to the west. The area had never been seriously hunted. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to deal with eight different villages for exclusive rights," Ruiz said. 
"We met every Sunday for six months with a different village." 
</P>
<P>
His agreements include getting a villager's truck fixed and providing a 
generator to supply electricity for 10 houses. This year, for the first time, 
the houses had small displays of Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz and his hunters also may be helping the local economy by cutting down bird 
depredation of the grain fields -- especially by doves. 
</P>
<P>
"We grow 80% of the grain in Mexico right here in the Yaqui Valley," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever sesame seeds the birds don't get wind up on hamburger buns in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers who plant sesame or sorghum, the doves are becoming predators to 
them," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a departure from ducks one day, Ruiz positions Missildine and Jansma 
between a large, brushy nesting area for mourning doves and a sesame field, 
where the stalks are stacked in three-foot-high, cone-shaped piles -- an 
irresistible free lunch for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAVING THE GRAIN 
</P>
<P>
Then, shortly after dawn, here come the doves. The hunters are about to do the 
farmers a favor. 
</P>
<P>
Blam! 
</P>
<P>
"These birds are eating the people's grain," Jansma said. "They have no 
redeeming qualities as far as the agriculture people are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Blam! 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three thousand birds eating two or three ounces apiece twice a day is a 
lot of grain," Missildine said. "I've seen signs up in Argentina with a picture 
of a paloma, saying, 'This is your enemy . . . kill him.' People don't realize 
how much grain these birds carry off. They were on the point of poisoning them 
in Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
Blam! 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz's bird boys are running nonstop to retrieve the kills. Ruiz opens the crop 
of one bird to show a handful of sesame seeds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a mission," Jansma said jokingly. "I'm trying to get the church to 
sponsor me." 
</P>
<P>
Blam! 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, a crack shot, kills 49 doves in about two hours, Missildine and Jansma 
"50 or 60" between them, but there are so many that they probably shoot only 
one out of every few hundred that flew over, to and from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot 2,000 in two days in Argentina once," Missildine said. 
</P>
<P>
Blam! 
</P>
<P>
When they have finished, the ground is littered with hundreds of green plastic 
shell casings. Ruiz has gone through "six or eight" 25-shot boxes of ammunition 
and Jansma five. They keep a few birds for dinner and give the rest to local 
residents -- thus, Missildine notes, nothing is wasted, and they contribute 
protein to the Mexican diet. 
</P>
<P>
Jansma prefers doves to ducks because there's more action. 
</P>
<P>
With ducks, Ruiz said, "It's rare for a hunter to take 45 (back to the U.S.) 
because there aren't that many good hunters. It's not as easy as this." 
</P>
<P>
And whereas the doves fly without prompting -- even through the streets of 
Obregon -- there are so few hunters that sometimes the ducks have to be stirred 
up by buzzing them with an air boat to get them flying. 
</P>
<P>
That's illegal in the United States, but a duck on the pond is not fair game. 
The Mexicans don't like to discuss the practice but, as one said, "You have to 
do it or the ducks won't move." 
</P>
<P>
And if the ducks don't move, Missildine and the other Americans might as well 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go duck hunting, I like to shoot ducks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has come to the right place.

<P>
Now that the Rams have lost, let's turn our attention to a winner -- the 
Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, they should become one any day. The way I have it figured, they will 
reach the .500 mark on Monday night after victories over Charlotte, Seattle, 
and Minnesota in the Sports Arena and the Kings at Sacramento. Clipper 
victories. Something you can count on after a 5-3 trip. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In alphabetical order, here are the people most responsible for finally making 
Los Angeles a two-team NBA city. Call them the Eight Men In: 
</P>
<P>
Elgin Baylor -- The general manager made the best basketball deal in years when 
he sent Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry to Cleveland for Ron 
Harper, two first-round draft choices and a second. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin -- A classic underacheiver his first four seasons in the 
league, he has become a consistent rebounding and shot-blocking force. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don Casey -- The coach is a household name only in his own house, but just 
watch how hard his team plays night after night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant -- He is still learning the most difficult position in the sport, 
point guard, but improving rapidly and bringing fans to their feet with his 
exciting style. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper -- We knew he was good, but this good? The best body control of any 
athlete who doesn't list Chicago Stadium as his address. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning -- An exceptional all-round talent who is just beginning to show 
his value after missing most of his rookie season because of knee surgery. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman -- He missed most of the trip because of injuries, but, with Manning 
and Charles Smith, gives the team a trio of young forwards unsurpassed in the 
NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith -- The product of another terrific Baylor trade. He can do so 
many more things than rebounding specialist Michael Cage, who was sent to 
Seattle in the deal that enabled the Clippers to draft Smith in 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Call George Foreman anything but dumb. He collected an easy $1.5 million by 
punching the heavy bag, Gerry Cooney, last night in Atlantic City and built up 
the gate for his eventual challenge to Mike Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Tracy Murray showed uncommon poise Saturday at Pauley Pavilion after 
Arizona made a run in the second half. Few other freshmen could have inbounded 
the ball so well under pressure. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC could be playing all its home games in friendly Lyon Center if it had been 
built to seat 4,500 instead of 2,200. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Kickoff Classic is trying to lure the Trojans back to East Rutherford, 
N.J., in August. But USC, which opens its regular season against Penn State, is 
not interested in powerful Florida State as the opponent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sailing authority Rich Roberts of The Times says the Super Bowl shapes up as a 
monohull vs. a catamaran. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An overlooked factor in the 49ers' success is the sheer strength of their 
defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I felt sorry for Ozzie Newsome, a class act on and off the field, after the 
Browns' latest AFC championship game setback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Owner of the year is Ed DeBartolo Jr., of San Francisco, who wasn't afraid to 
spend a buck to improve a championship team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to lose, but quite another to show signs of life in only one of 
three periods as the Kings did the other night against the Hartford Whalers at 
the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is it a breakdown in the defensive system, or has goaltender Kelly Hrudey been 
something of a disappointment since being acquired from the New York Islanders 
last season?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Asked about conditions during the Romanian revolution, Olympic 1,500-meter 
champion Paula Ivan, here to compete in the Sunkist meet Friday night, said, 
"It's hard to train when bullets are flying by." . . . 
</P>
<P>
A television mini-series about the life of Lionel Rose is being filmed in 
Australia. Rose, who has regained his health after suffering a heart attack 
last year, is the aborigine who won the bantamweight title from Fighting Harada 
in 1968 and fought several times at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With its twin towers of Alonzo Mourning and Dikembo Mutombo, Georgetown might 
have more pro prospects at center than the rest of the nation combined. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Gervin's brother Derrick of the Santa Barbara Islanders is leading the 
Continental Basketball Assn. in scoring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita shouldn't be reluctant to give the George Woolf Award to the same 
jockey more than once. At this rate, every other jockey in America will own a 
Woolf before long. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Has the Super Bowl pregame show started yet?

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
KNICKS BEAT CLOCK AND BULLS, 109-106 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When New York reporters covering the Knicks wrote early this season that 
seven-foot Patrick Ewing had developed into the best center in the NBA, it was 
greeted with some skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But Ewing has changed that. A disappointment early in his five-year pro career, 
the Knick center has become a dominant figure in the middle, both on offense 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had 33 points Monday at New York, but his defensive work was more 
important as the Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 109-106, on a controversial 
play in the final one-tenth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much time was remaining when Mark Jackson inbounded the ball to 
Trent Tucker, who turned and made a 26-foot, three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," Bull Coach Phil Jackson said. "There isn't time enough to 
get off a shot. That was a one- or two-second shot. A tenth of a second it was 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Referee Paul Mihalik said, "It was a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
The strange finish did not diminish the performance of Ewing. His exceptional 
play kept the Bulls from winning handily. 
</P>
<P>
He blocked eight shots and grabbed 12 rebounds. His presence prevented Michael 
Jordan from taking the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, only nine of 24 from the field, had 26 points. His jump shot gave the 
Bulls a 106-104 lead with 1:21 left. But Ewing grabbed a rebound and scored to 
tie the score with 65 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 92, San Antonio 89 -- Mark Price does not consider himself another 
Magic Johnson, but he always wanted to get a triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
He picked a good time for his first. Facing the tough Spurs at Richfield, Ohio, 
Price had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Cavaliers prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs lost their second consecutive road game, despite 28 points, 10 
rebounds and four blocked shots by David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 101, Dallas 90 -- Alex English scored 20 of his season-high 29 points to 
help the Nuggets build a comfortable lead, but Coach Doug Moe was not happy 
with his team's play at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we've hit rock bottom offensively, because we were terrible today," Moe 
said. "We weren't active, we stood around too much and we were totally out of 
sync." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 144, Golden State 105 -- The Warriors are as bad on the road as they 
are good at home. After winning six in a row at home, they were never in this 
game at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers scored 44 points in the first quarter and led, 86-48, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 111, Washington 105 -- Glen Rice scored 11 of his 27 points in the fourth 
quarter at Landover, Md., to lead a comeback by the Heat and end its 13-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets were led by Bernard King with 30 points, but he was sitting on the 
bench when the Heat wiped out a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 118, Charlotte 108 -- Tom Chambers scored 40 points, but the Suns had 
to go overtime to hand the Hornets their 15th loss on the road without a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets battled from a 69-52 deficit to force the overtime on a three-point 
basket by Rex Chapman with 23 seconds left. In overtime, Charlotte was 
outscored, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 105, Houston 101 -- The SuperSonics, who have been complaining about 
not getting a fair shake from referees, lost Coach Bernie Bickerstaff by 
ejection early, but outlasted the Rockets at Seattle. DAN HAFNER

CAPITALS FIRE MURRAY AS COACH, REPLACE HIM WITH HIS BROTHER

<P>
Bryan Murray, who had the longest tenure of any current coach in the NHL, was 
fired Monday by the Washington Capitals and replaced by his brother, Terry 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Capital General Manager David Poile said there was a long pause on the 
telephone when he offered the job to Terry Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he was hoping for a better time or better circumstances for when he 
was going to get the job," Poile said. "But he said to me, 'This is what I've 
been preparing my hockey career for and yes, I'll accept the job.' I know he is 
disappointed that he is replacing his brother. But I didn't get rid of Bryan 
because he was a bad person or a bad coach. I did it because the team needs a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Murray, 39, has been coach of the Capitals' American Hockey League 
affiliate Baltimore Skipjacks for the past two seasons. He was with the 
Skipjacks in Ontario Monday night, but Poile said Terry would travel back to 
Maryland in time for the Capitals' practice today. Washington plays host to New 
Jersey tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Murray had coached the Capitals since November of 1981, leading them to 
the playoffs seven times. The Capitals finished first in the Patrick Division 
last season with 92 points, but lost to Philadelphia in the division 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed for myself," Bryan Murray said, "but I'm happy for Terry." 
</P>
<P>
Poile said he told Bryan Murray of the decision at practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The contributions of Bryan Murray to this organization have been as much or as 
many as any other person or player who has ever played or been a part of this 
organization," Poile said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that Bryan Murray will be a coach in the National 
Hockey League, and probably very soon," Poile said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Murray's career record is 343-246-83. This season, the Capitals (18-24-4) 
have lost eight consecutive games and are last place in the Patrick Division.

NEELY FUELS STREAKING BRUINS PAST WHALERS, 4-1

Cam Neely is in his seventh season in the NHL. The first three were at 
Vancouver, a team that never was a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Boston Bruins, the veteran right wing has blossomed into a 
star. It has helped that the Bruins are usually a contender. 
</P>
<P>
These days Neely is excited. He has the feeling the Bruins are ready to go 
after the Stanley Cup. He is doing his part. 
</P>
<P>
Neely scored the tiebreaking goal Monday night at Boston and assisted on 
another to lead the Bruins to a 4-1 victory over the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, leading the Adams Division, have won 10 of their last 12 games and 
have the best overall record (27-16-3). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about this club," said Neely, who has 32 goals. "We have the size 
and strength we have lacked. We're ready to play anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Boston goalie Andy Moog made 32 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Chicago 6 -- A controversial goal by Wendel Clark with 6:15 
remaining in regulation enabled the improving Maple Leafs to finish their 
homestand with a 6-1-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago goaltender Jacques Cloutier had his mitt covering the puck after a 
shot. But Clark poked at it, finally dislodging the puck and sending it over 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks claimed the play should have been blown dead, but referee Ron 
Hoggarth allowed the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Minnesota 3 -- Todd Ewen's first goal of the season with 8:42 
remaining in regulation at Montreal gave the Canadiens the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ewen, acquired from St. Louis, knocked in the rebound of a shot by Brian 
Skrudland. It was the 13th game Ewen played since being traded by the Blues.

The NBA will not sanction a proposed $1-million one-on-one duel between Michael 
Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and Magic Johnson of the Lakers, according to a 
report in the Chicago Sun-Times.

AUTO INCIDENT RESULTS IN ARREST OF NUNN FOR PREVIOUS TRAFFIC TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation's middleweight champion, was 
arrested and released late Saturday night on a traffic warrant that was 
discovered after Nunn chased down a motorist who had rear-ended his car, Van 
Nuys police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn told police that the motorist threatened him with a knife after the chase. 
</P>
<P>
The motorist, Nicholas Munoz, 57, of Van Nuys was also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn was arrested because a computer check showed an unpaid speeding ticket 
that he had received in December. He was held briefly in the Van Nuys jail and 
then released when Dan Goossen, his manager, posted $3,000 bail. A judge will 
determine the fine that Nunn could face for the traffic warrant, police said. A 
court date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Goossen said the boxer had aggravated a back injury in the crash and would be 
examined by doctors later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident began when Nunn's 1989 Mercedes-Benz was struck by a 
car driven by Munoz. According to police, Munoz then drove away, with Nunn in 
pursuit. The boxer eventually forced Munoz's car to the side of the road, and 
both drivers got out of their cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn told police that Munoz then pulled a knife. When officers arrived, Munoz 
had a bloody nose. Police said they did not know whether Nunn had punched him 
or whether the injury had occurred in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz was charged with felony hit-and-run driving, assault with a deadly weapon 
and suspicion of drunk driving. RICH TOSCHES

CAL STATE FULLERTON HITS A LOW FOR THE ROAD 
</P>

SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The road has been brutal to Cal State Fullerton this season. Pauley Pavilion 
and the Thomas and Mack Center have taken their measure of the Titans, and they 
have found them wanting. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has lost on the road to UCLA and Nevada Las Vegas. The Titans can 
accept that. 
</P>
<P>
They have been beaten by Colorado State in a gym named after a whale, Moby 
Arena. They have lost to Wyoming in the isolated town of Casper, and to Utah 
State in snowy Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
They can accept all those. But they never thought they would see the day that 
they would lose in a place still looking for someone to be named after, a new 
arena called the Student Union Recreation and Events Center. A crowd of 2,126 
there rattled the Titans into a 66-60 loss to San Jose State on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the same San Jose State that started a program almost from scratch this 
season after the player walkout against Coach Bill Berry last season. Yes, the 
team that had lost 21 games in a row before beating Texas Christian in the 
fourth game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Titans said, this one was humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest," said Wayne Williams, Fullerton's point guard. "I never 
expected to lose to San Jose State." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this season, with four starters back from a 16-13 team, the 
Titans had other expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I had hopes of going to the NCAAs," Williams said. "But the 
way things are going now, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, 8-6 overall and 2-3 in the Big West Conference, is 2-6 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State, with a record of 5-9 and 2-3 in conference play, already has 
matched its victory total of last season, when it finished 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
In the company of victories over Texas Christian, Santa Clara, Idaho State and 
UC Irvine, this may rank as the biggest victory since the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
But who is quibbling? 
</P>
<P>
"Every win for the Spartans is a big win," Coach Stan Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos led Fullerton with 24 points.

THESE 49ERS WIN IN A ROUT, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE LONG BEACH USES PINPOINT SHOOTING TO SURPRISE NEW 
MEXICO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The prospects of breaking a shooting slump did not appear good for Cal State 
Long Beach, which had to face a hot New Mexico State team and its tough matchup 
zone defense Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the 49ers shot 50.9% from the field and got a triple-double from guard 
Tyrone Mitchell in winning the Big West Conference game, 72-56, before a crowd 
of 1,998 in the university gym. 
</P>
<P>
They shot that well by following their game plan: Move the ball around, get it 
inside and make the easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Long Beach had not even been making the easy ones. Last week the 49ers 
shot 31% in barely defeating UC Irvine and improved to only 39% in a loss at UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed dramatically against the first-place Aggies, who had won 12 
consecutive games. Not only did the 49ers, 11-3 overall and 4-2 in the 
conference, shoot better, but for the first time in four games they weren't 
outrebounded. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had 11 rebounds, 11 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"A triple-double for a college player, I can't believe it," Long Beach Coach 
Joe Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first triple-double accomplished against New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"We have athletes and we have scorers," said Mitchell, who also had four 
steals. "I'm just trying to plug in the holes." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kevin Cutler led the 49ers with 17 points. He made seven of 11 shots to 
break a five-of-21 slump. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, 7-0 at home, also got a big lift from Frankie Edwards, who got a 
rare start at center and responded with 11 rebounds, 10 points and two blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well," New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy said. "They 
outplayed us and played harder than we did." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers took charge of the game early when, trailing, 4-2, they scored 10 
points in a row. The Aggies got to within 25-21, but in the last two minutes of 
the half the 49ers went on a 7-0 run that was started by Lucious Harris' 
three-point basket 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State (14-2, 5-1) didn't offer a serious challenge in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been poor at attacking zones," Harrington said. "Yesterday and today 
we worked on that." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was also good defensively, holding the Aggies to 35% shooting and 
forcing 22 turnovers.

Larry Johnson scored 28 points to lead No. 9 Nevada Las Vegas to an 84-75 
victory over Fresno State Monday night in a Big West Conference basketball game 
in Selland Arena at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored 17 of his points in the second half as UNLV (11-3, 5-1 in 
conference play) broke open the game with a 22-12 run in the first eight 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
David Butler added 16 points and 13 rebounds for UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Tod Bernard led Fresno State (6-8, 1-4) with a career-high 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 91, Utah State 82 -- Idris Jones scored 25 points, including 
seven three-point baskets, and Eric McArthur had 19 rebounds and four blocked 
shots to lead the Gauchos at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos took control early, taking a 17-3 lead with 15:48 left in the half 
with help from Jones' long-range shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gray and McArthur each scored 17 for the Gauchos (10-4, 4-2). Paul Johnson 
added 14 and Lucious Davis 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies (9-7, 3-2) were led by Kendall Youngblood with 24 points. Darrel 
White finished with 18 and Allen Gordon 15.

THE HIGH PRICE OF OVERTIME; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICA HAS A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTRA HOURS. THE PAY'S GOOD, BUT IT 
COSTS WORKERS PLENTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EVERETT, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing furious deadlines, Margaret Nix worked 34 out of every 35 days on the 
Boeing Co.'s aircraft assembly line. Mandatory overtime, 12-hour days. She 
gained a pile of money. She lost a disgruntled husband. Then her teen-age 
daughter suffered an unrelated psychological breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
One day Nix, who asked that her real name not be used, tried to coax the 
withdrawn girl to recall some of the family's good times. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom," her daughter said, "you were never home." 
</P>
<P>
Such stories, drenched in guilt and anger, contributed to a 48-day strike last 
fall by 57,000 Boeing machinists. Some of the strikers carried picket signs 
demanding stricter limits on overtime with slogans such as, "Do your children 
know what you look like?" 
</P>
<P>
Life at Boeing -- where the company now promises to limit overtime to a mere 
144 hours every three months -- is an extreme example of the pressure overtime 
work can generate. Yet late in the afternoon each day in many offices and 
factories, the same kind of tension gurgles in the stomachs of hundreds of 
thousands of employees who pray that they won't be asked or ordered to work 
overtime -- and those who are equally hopeful that they will. 
</P>
<P>
America's work force has a love-hate relationship with overtime. On one side 
are people desperate for more money. On the other are people desperate for more 
personal time. 
</P>
<P>
For every Margaret Nix at Boeing there is a co-worker like Charles Anderson, a 
generation younger, who came to the Everett plant last year badly in debt and 
volunteered to work far beyond maximum mandatory overtime to pull his bank 
balance up. Figure it. If you work 20 hours a week overtime on a $14-an-hour 
machinist job -- and Anderson has worked as many as 40 extra hours some weeks 
-- your pay shoots from $560 to $980. 
</P>
<P>
Some Boeing workers are relieved that the company is cutting back on OT in the 
wake of the strike. But Anderson, who is married and the father of a 2-year-old 
daughter he barely knew until the strike, is going crazy. He was planning on 
buying a house this spring. Now he's uncertain if he'll make enough money to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million Americans who work for hourly wages supplement their 
paychecks by $40 billion to $50 billion a year by working an average of nine 
extra hours a week at time-and-a-half. The money pays for things as 
discretionary as vacations and as crucial as mortgages and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime can mean limitless potential for some workers, such as the Los Angeles 
County fireman who worked so many consecutive 24-hour shifts a few years ago 
that he made $98,000 -- more than the county fire chief. It can mean countless 
headaches for others, such as the working mothers who make frantic telephone 
calls to day-care centers to say they'll be late. It generates arguments with 
supervisors over uncomfortable questions -- who should get first dibs on OT, 
who should volunteer, or who should be volunteered on days when nobody wants to 
work the extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime is the grease that allows many companies to pare their work forces in 
this era of so-called "lean-and-mean" business. It is the friction that drives 
many of today's demands for flexible schedules and child-care facilities at 
businesses for the convenience of working parents. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory overtime, particularly when assigned with little notice, "is one of 
the last holdouts" in the debate over balancing work and family concerns, said 
Dr. Susan Ginsberg, editor of a work and family life newspaper at Bank Street 
College in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Flex time, child care, changing maternity benefits -- they're all being 
discussed, but there's not much awareness of the overtime issue" as the cause 
of personal chaos, Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
All told, 34 million people -- nearly one-third of the nation's work force -- 
work more than 40 hours a week. Most do not get paid for their extra hours 
because they are either self-employed or are salaried supervisors or 
"professionals" exempt from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which 
requires time-and-a-half for work beyond eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comp Time 
</P>
<P>
Some uncompensated overtime workers take off extra days or weeks of "comp time" 
each year. However, three-quarters of the nation's employers do not permit comp 
time, according to preliminary results of a survey of 197 companies by the 
Bureau of National Affairs Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has not separately surveyed paid 
overtime workers since 1985. Its current surveys, which lump together those who 
labor with and without overtime pay, show that 12.6 million Americans work 49 
to 59 hours a week and another 9.3 million work 60 or more hours. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers are climbing twice as fast as the size of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
While the total number of employed persons rose 19% in the past decade, the 
number working 49 to 59 hours rose 46%. The number working 60 or more hours 
rose 38%. 
</P>
<P>
These increases have contributed to today's portrait of a sometimes strained 
American family life. 
</P>
<P>
Median weekly hours worked by Americans increased 20% between 1973 and 1985, 
from 40.6 a week to 48.8, while the leisure time plummeted 32%, from 26.2 hours 
to 17.7 hours, according to polls taken by Louis Harris &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are working harder because earnings by hourly workers have lagged 15% 
behind consumer price increases since the late 1970s, labor economists say. Not 
only does the number of two-income households continue to rise, but more than 7 
million people now work two jobs -- the highest level in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that there may be something fundamentally harmful about longer 
working hours is scarcely audible. Yet it was not always this way. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest contributions of the American organized labor movement 
since its inception in the early 19th Century was to lobby for reduced working 
hours. In the early 20th Century, with the average workweek still above 50 
hours, there was considerable Utopian debate about how leisure -- not work -- 
might one day become man's prime concern as technology freed him from long, 
backbreaking days. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression, the notion of shorter hours gained political support as 
a way to spread a severely limited number of jobs. Legislation to create a 
30-hour workweek passed the U.S. Senate in the early 1930s and appeared to have 
strong momentum. But President Franklin D. Roosevelt eventually refused to 
support it, countering with a series of public works programs to create more 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Course Is Set 
</P>
<P>
It was this change of philosophy -- trading shorter hours for the right to work 
-- that set the nation on its present course, said Benjamin K. Hunnicutt, a 
professor of leisure studies at the University of Iowa who wrote "Work Without 
End." Most Americans have now come to define themselves by their jobs, not 
their beliefs, and shorter hours are regarded as a negative economic indicator, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most West European nations, by contrast, have significantly shortened work 
hours since World War II. The European workweek is now generally shorter than 
the American week, and vacations are significantly longer. Many European 
countries have national limits on overtime. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the overtime premium created by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
passed in 1938, was intended as a penalty to coerce employers into hiring more 
people rather than using longer shifts. But it lost most of its force long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the soaring costs of company-paid health insurance and other 
benefits, which now make up 25% to 35% of the cost of compensation, employers 
find it far cheaper to scale back the number of permanent employees and get the 
job done by paying overtime. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while the manufacturing sector of the economy saw significant 
layoffs during the 1980s, the average weekly overtime of individual 
manufacturing workers increased 40% from 1980 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Trammell, a Los Angeles attorney who represents mostly salaried employees 
in worker's compensation cases, says he sees an increasing number of cases in 
which excessive hours contribute to health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers are shrinking their staffs, and when they do that they cut muscle, 
bone and everything else as well as fat, and those who are left are absolutely 
going over the edge . . . they feel overwhelmed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Zalusky, an AFL-CIO economist, said that in order to force employers to 
use more hourly workers instead of relying on overtime, the labor standards act 
would have to be amended to require triple pay for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the AFL-CIO's biannual constitutional convention last fall 
advocated such a change, but the issue is not a high priority to organized 
labor because a significant number of its members, particularly younger 
workers, want all the overtime they can get. 
</P>
<P>
"What's difficult for organized labor is that they have two constituencies," 
said Richard Belous, an economist with the National Planning Assn. who 
specializes in work-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
With many workers feeling stretched by low wage growth and insecure about the 
future because of corporate restructuring that has laid off millions of 
employees, the idea of limiting overtime sounds quixotic or plain threatening. 
</P>
<P>
There was no better illustration of this addiction to overtime than what 
happened a couple months ago in a Chrysler mini-van plant in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler wanted to cut a deal with Local 110 of the United Auto Workers. It 
wanted to change the plant, where workers average 54 hours a week, to a 
four-day week with a standard 10-hour shift. Chrysler would boost production by 
20%, absorbing 1,000 to 1,300 workers who were about to be laid off at a nearby 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Workers Say No 
</P>
<P>
The proposal sounded attractive, for it would preserve jobs in a beleaguered 
industry. However, Local 110's rank-and-file objected because they would no 
longer receive overtime for working 10-hour days. In addition, Chrysler wanted 
to cut Saturday overtime from time-and-a-half to time-and-a-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The union, whose approval was needed to modify an existing contract, voted 
2,340 to 300 against the expansion plan, triggering an onslaught of publicity 
branding them as selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted us to work the same amount of hours for less pay," said Charlie 
Sides, the local's recording secretary. "You need the money because you never 
know when it's (the plant) going to shut down again." 
</P>
<P>
When the International Assn. of Machinists' contract with Boeing expired last 
fall, the aerospace company offered to drop its maximum overtime limit of 200 
hours per quarter -- about 15 hours a week -- to 160. But because the union 
wanted a larger hourly wage increase and less mandatory OT, a strike was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the strike, Boeing resisted demands for further hourly wage 
increases, but increased the size of year-end bonuses. In addition to cutting 
mandatory overtime to 144 hours per quarter, it cut mandatory weekend overtime 
from three consecutive weekends to two and said that working either a Saturday 
or Sunday -- not both days, as before -- would constitute overtime weekend 
work. In addition, for the first time, all overtime work over 160 hours per 
quarter will earn double time. 
</P>
<P>
For all the value an employer can squeeze out of a work force by using 
overtime, smart bosses recognize the hazards of burn-out that come with too 
much mandatory OT, said Norman Handshear, an aerospace executive who is 
president of the American Compensation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad J. Conway, administrative manager of GE Plastics in Oxnard, confronts 
this choice often. Conway runs a 24-hour factory and spends 8% to 10% of his 
payroll on overtime, but has chosen on occasion to shut down some of his 
machinery when he can't find enough volunteers to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have mandatory overtime here," he said. "We do at times talk to 
people about the need to share the overtime burden, ask non-participants to 
pick up some, but I don't think there's any merit in mandatory overtime. It 
spreads out the effort but it probably leads to hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
The effort was spread as broadly as possible -- and with considerable hard 
feelings -- at Vons market distribution center in El Monte last year. 
</P>
<P>
Vons spent much of 1989 trying to integrate its stores with the newly acquired 
Safeway chain, an effort that put particular pressures on the distribution 
center's warehouses. Mandatory overtime resulted in months of 12-hour to 
16-hour days for many of the 250 warehouse workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nine, maybe a dozen wives call me during that time to chew my butt off 
about how much the guys were working," said Tony Perez, a business agent for 
the United Food and Commercial Workers local that represents the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the union contract calls for double-time pay after 10 hours, warehouse 
workers, who make between $5 and $13 an hour, saw huge checks. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson, a 25-year employee from Rialto, paid off all his bills and 
bought a new Thunderbird, but there is no sparkle in his eye when he talks 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
For five months, Anderson said, his wife moved out of the house because she 
couldn't put up with his constant irritability, due mostly to a lack of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working 36 to 45 hours OT a week but the money didn't mean too much to 
me," Anderson said. "Sometimes there wouldn't be eight hours between going home 
and coming back. I'd be sleeping four, five hours a day. A lot of times I'd 
doze off driving home." 
</P>
<P>
Desperate, the union had its attorney send Vons a letter warning that unless 
overtime was reduced, Vons could be legally liable for any traffic accidents 
its workers were involved in when they commuted. 
</P>
<P>
After six months, the worst of the overtime ended as the Safeway acquisition 
work smoothed out. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago something strange happened to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw my first eight-hour day in I don't know how long," he said. "I snuck out 
the (warehouse) door." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who had moved back, was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she thought someone was trying to break into the house," Anderson 
said.

KING IN O.C.: Martin Luther King Jr. did, in fact, make an Orange County 
appearance, but it takes a long memory to recall it. . . . King, billed merely 
as "minister and author," spoke at Chapman College on Dec. 10, 1961, on 
"Nonviolence and Racial Justice." On the anniversary of his birth Monday, he 
was honored in Santa Ana (B1) and across the nation (A4). Steve Emmons and Mark

HOT STOVE LEAGUE: The Rams (C1) are history and the weather (A1) is lousy, so 
let's talk baseball. . . . With only 32 days left until spring training, some 
Angels were working out Monday at Anaheim Stadium, but more were practicing 
their swings at Western Hills Country Club in Chino, site of pitcher Bert 
Blyleven's celebrity tournament. "The Rams had kind of the same season we had 
with Oakland," Blyleven said, recalling the Angels' bid to beat the A's. "But I 
think when you get that close, when you get a taste of it, it can carry you all 
the way the next year." Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky

ON CALIFORNIA: A TRUMP CARD AND AN ACE UP THE SLEEVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Mr. Trump: 
</P>
<P>
We love it that you love L.A. As soon as we picked up our Sunday paper and saw 
-- right there on Page 1! -- your plans to tear down the ratty Ambassador Hotel 
and build the World's Tallest Building in its place, our smog-choked chests 
heaved with pride. Trumpomania, here at last! 
</P>
<P>
Do you wanna know how bad it was before you got here? Here's how bad: Just last 
summer we topped off the Library Tower building downtown and thought it was a 
big deal. Lotsa ink in the local sheets, and it was just a measly 73 stories 
tall. Now you pop into town, and right off you're talking 125 stories! 
</P>
<P>
That's why that scamp John Ferraro (he's our City Council president) was right 
on the mark at your press conference when he quipped, "Why did it take you so 
long to get to Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
And you just smiled like a chipmunk at that one. Heh, heh, you old faker. That 
stuff in New York, Trump Tower and all, that was just in prelude, wasn't it? 
And the casinos in Atlantic City, merely a warm-up, eh? Now you're gonna strut 
your real stuff, go for the works, and where? Los Angeles! We knew you wouldn't 
forget! 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe it's true that not everyone loves it that you love L.A. Maybe some 
grouches have claimed you showed up at your news conference without plans or 
drawings or descriptions of any of the new buildings, not even a sketch of the 
World's Tallest Building. And maybe the grumps wondered why the mayor and two 
city councilmen agreed to stand around like house plants at your news 
conference when they didn't know squat about what you intend or when. 
</P>
<P>
Well, let me give you a little advice: Those nattering negativos don't mean 
nothing. Here in L.A., we understand a high concept when we see it. Let the 
little people deal with details like traffic and congestion and design. Just 
keep repeating the phrase, "World's Tallest Building," and the mayor will show 
up to play house plant any time you need him. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is one thing I'm curious about. I noticed that, when you bought your 
share of the Ambassador property, you changed the name of the company from 
Wilshire Center Partners to Trump Wilshire Associates. And rightly so, of 
course. People should know who's ushering L.A. toward its future. 
</P>
<P>
But you didn't say what you intend to call the World's Tallest Building and its 
ensemble of Slightly Smaller Buildings. At first I thought that Trump City 
would do the trick. That way, see, your development could act as a counterpart 
to something called Century City, a little thing we built ourselves out on the 
Westside. Then I realized that was a bad idea. Compared to yours, Century 
City's buildings aren't tall at all, they're hardly even skyscrapers, and 
there's not nearly enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
So I was reading the news stories, looking for clues, when I read where you 
intend to employ "true California style" in the design of your buildings. This 
inspired me. How about "La Ciudad Trump," hmmm? It has that international ring 
to it. Or "Rancho Trump Deluxe?" Or, if you wanted to pick up on a lost theme 
of L.A. design, "Tail o' the Trump" might do nicely. These are just a couple of 
ideas, of course. We have a lot more if you need them. 
</P>
<P>
I have saved this last matter to the end because it's, well, sensitive to all 
of us here in Los Angeles. We understand that, in truth, you have also been 
working on another proposal for the World's Tallest Building, and that other 
proposal is located right smack in the middle of you-know-where. New York. We 
also understand -- and this is where it hurts -- that New York's World's 
Tallest Building is planned for 150 stories, 25 more stories than our World's 
Tallest Building. 
</P>
<P>
Yo, Don, what goes? Do you understand the insecurities you are stirring up 
here? Are we gonna be top dog, or is this another case where we get stuck with 
the old "biggest west of the Mississippi" monicker? We're real sick of the 
west-of-the-Mississippi business, Donnie. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky for us, there are solutions to this problem. You could always switch 
plans and go the full 150 here while you slipped the ol' 125 to New York. It 
would make their Tallest Building look like a termite mound, haw haw. This 
would be a favor we wouldn't forget, Donnie. We might even let you stick one of 
your dollar bills in wet cement at Grauman's, right next to Rin Tin Tin's paw 
prints. It's a high concept to think about.

<P>
There's a law on the books in California that prohibits the "unauthorized 
practice of law." It is vague, little-known and rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
But Mershan Shaddy, a San Diego paralegal, learned recently that the law is 
still very much enforceable. Found guilty in a criminal case of practicing law 
without a license, he currently is appealing the conviction and the sentence 
he's facing for the offense -- 49 days in jail. 
</P>

Shaddy's case is believed to be the first time a paralegal has been found 
guilty in a California criminal case of the unauthorized practice of law, 
various members of the state's legal community said. 
</P>
<P>
It has made paralegals around the state fearful of additional prosecutions and 
resulted in a ban on some paralegal advertising in San Diego's Copley Press. 
</P>
<P>
The case also has served to underscore the growing tension in the legal 
marketplace between California's 122,300 attorneys, who enjoy a monopoly on the 
practice of law, and paralegals, who see a burgeoning market for routine 
services that lawyers can't, or don't want to, provide economically. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the prosecution said this case was not brought about by lawyers 
against paralegals, to me it's relatively clear that they were just waiting 
(for me)," Shaddy said. "Because what is happening with paralegals, in the 
industry itself, is naturally going to infringe on a lot of people's income." 
</P>
<P>
The paralegal business is projected to be the fastest-growing occupation in the 
United States in the next 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, there were 83,000 paralegals nationwide. By the year 2000, planners 
expect there will be 145,000, a jump of 75%, said Jon Lukasiewicz, a bureau 
economist in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of California paralegals are not readily available, but 
there already are enough that there is a California Paralegal magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, there are three kinds of paralegals. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely known group is made up of paralegals who are the salaried 
employees of an attorney or law firm. This group most commonly performs the 
paralegal's traditional duties: legal research, witness investigations, 
obtaining and reviewing documents, checking citations in briefs and organizing 
cases for trial. 
</P>
<P>
A second group performs the same duties but as independent contractors to law 
firms and attorneys. There's so much work for these paralegals that Teri L. 
Dellinger of Carlsbad, who runs Juriserv &amp; Associates, said she is 
completing plans to franchise her business. 
</P>
<P>
The third category is made up of self-described "independent paralegals." These 
paralegals assist their own customers in filling out forms for legal matters 
such as bankruptcies, uncontested divorces, wills, adoptions, Social Security 
claims, real estate closings and contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If a problem truly requires legal advice, these paralegals claim they refer the 
customer to an attorney. But if a matter does not require particularized 
advice, independent paralegals say they can do the job -- and for much less 
than lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to be able to deal with the law themselves," said Catherine 
Jermany, president of the National Assn. for Independent Paralegals in Sonoma. 
"That is dangerous for some persons." 
</P>
<P>
That danger -- to lawyers, the implication goes -- prompted the San Diego city 
attorney's office to prosecute Shaddy, independent paralegals charge. 
</P>
<P>
Shaddy, supporters contend, was a victim of selective prosecution and overly 
aggressive tactics by the San Diego city attorney's office, especially in the 
use of an undercover agent who secretly recorded a meeting she had with Shaddy. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors William R. Newsome and Michael Rivo, who handled the case, deny 
those charges and said they pursued the case solely as a matter of public 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Shaddy, a paralegal since 1985, was charged with illegally 
practicing law after the undercover agent visited his business, called 
California Legal Administration, in November, 1988. The agent was sent to see 
Shaddy after the city attorney's office received two complaints about him from 
dissatisfied customers, Rivo said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator, who secretly taped her entire conversation, asked Shaddy 
about divorce and bankruptcy services. The prosecutors said she taped him 
giving her legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
Though paralegals can perform many of the tasks traditionally left to lawyers, 
they may not advise clients on legal matters or hold themselves out as an 
expert in legal areas, said Sue Sullivan, director of the University of San 
Diego's Lawyer's Assistant Program. 
</P>
<P>
The gray area, the source of the tension between lawyers and paralegals, is 
what constitutes "legal advice." There is no definition and in a recent case, 
even a state appellate court in San Diego recognized the futility of trying to 
come up with one. 
</P>
<P>
"Any definition of legal practice is, given the complexity and variability of 
the subject, incapable of universal application and can provide only a general 
guide to whether a particular act or activity is the practice of law," the 4th 
District Court of Appeal said in a civil case involving an Orange County 
eviction service. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there is no definition for the "unauthorized practice of law." 
</P>
<P>
Paralegals charge that both terms are kept deliberately vague so that lawyers 
and judges can mold the law to fit a particular case. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Shaddy went on trial in San Diego Municipal Court. Convicted by a 
jury after a three-day trial where the tape was the main piece of evidence 
against him, court records show that Judge Robert Coates sentenced him in 
November to the 49 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Coates suspended the sentence pending Shaddy's appeal and the paralegal remains 
free on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Elias, a lawyer and editor for Nolo Press in Berkeley, which publishes 
books on self-help in legal matters and serves as an informal clearinghouse on 
the topic, was Shaddy's expert witness at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The sin lawyers would like to prosecute -- and you've got to remember that 
judges are lawyers -- is looking like a lawyer, acting like a lawyer, being an 
expert," Elias said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors Rivo and Newsome said the case had nothing to do with the 
protection of lawyers' turf. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel no particular devotion or loyalty to the State Bar of California," 
Newsome said. "I'm not putting them down or anything, but my responsibility as 
a prosecutor is to prosecute violations of state law and that doesn't 
necessarily jibe with my being an attorney member of the State Bar." 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar played no role in referring Shaddy's case to the city attorney's 
office, nor in prosecuting him, since it stopped investigating complaints of 
unauthorized practice in 1985, spokesman Tod Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Shaddy, his defense attorneys and other paralegals suspect that 
Shaddy was prosecuted with the Bar in mind. That's largely because Shaddy's 
case has been playing itself out while the Bar has been publicly wrestling 
these last two years with what to do about paralegals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a special Bar committee, charged with exploring the scope of the laws 
against unauthorized practice of law, surprised the Bar by recommending that it 
urge the repeal of the laws. Last summer, the Bar's Board of Governors rejected 
that recommendation and instead appointed another special committee. 
</P>
<P>
That panel is charged with deciding whether the idea of licensing non-lawyer 
"legal technicians" is worth pursuing. The committee is due to make its 
recommendations by July 1, said chairwoman Robin Paige Donoghue of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Shaddy supporters said they suspect he was prosecuted so that the committee 
will be able to point to him as an example of the dangers of paralegal 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Bar already has come to the inescapable conclusion they cannot 
allow the door to open any wider," said Jermany, head of the national 
independent paralegal group. "I think they've decided they can't abandon the 
unauthorized practice (laws)." 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue and other panel members, including San Diego Municipal Judge Melinda 
J. Lasater, said Shaddy's case had not been formally presented to the panel as 
evidence of anything. In addition, panel members stressed that they had not 
reached any conclusions about paralegal licensing. 
</P>
<P>
The case has led to one concrete consequence. Independent paralegals can no 
longer advertise in the Copley Press, which publishes the San Diego Union and 
the San Diego Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Independents used to be free to place ads in the "personals" section of the two 
papers, which share classifieds. 
</P>
<P>
After Shaddy was convicted last fall, however, the city attorney's office sent 
the Copley papers a four-page letter urging it to "put a stop to this 
unnecessary and highly irregular practice." 
</P>
<P>
Non-lawyer advertising of legal services is "criminal conduct" because 
paralegals don't have a law license, Newsome contended in the letter. He added 
that a newspaper did not have a First Amendment right to publish ads for 
illegal commercial activity, and that doing so opens it up for "substantial 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
The Copley papers reluctantly agreed, general counsel Hal Fuson said.

DEMOCRATS TARGET ORANGE COUNTY'S DORNAN, PRINGLE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE STATE PARTY PLANS A MAJOR REGISTRATION DRIVE TO BREAK A GOP LOCK 
ON THE AREA'S STATE AND FEDERAL SEATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
State Democratic leaders said Monday that they will try to break the 
Republicans' lock on Orange County's state and federal legislative seats this 
year with a major registration effort aimed at Rep. Robert Dornan and 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement reached at a weekend meeting in San Diego, state Democratic 
Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. pledged to contribute $25,000 to the registration 
drive and pay for a full-time staff director by March 1. He also said he will 
sponsor a fund-raiser for the financially strapped county party. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Calfo, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said Orange 
County "is crackable." 
</P>
<P>
The Pringle and Dornan seats are attractive to Democrats because both districts 
already have a Democratic edge in registration and the areas overlap, enhancing 
the impact of a registration drive. 
</P>
<P>
Also, anti-war activist and Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, whose life story is told 
in the current movie "Born on the Fourth of July," is considering a challenge 
to Dornan, a Garden Grove Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, also a Garden Grove Republican, is considered vulnerable because his 
1988 campaign was involved in the decision to place uniformed guards at several 
polling places in predominantly Latino sections of Santa Ana. The FBI and the 
district attorney's office are conducting a criminal investigation to determine 
whether the move violated voters' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said Monday that he has long expected the state Democratic Party to 
target his seat, as it did when he narrowly won his first election in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known they were going to come after me," he said. "I know I have a lot of 
support among Democrats. It remains to be seen what the outcome will be." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said the Republican Party is also involved in registration efforts in 
his district. While the county Democratic Party has no full-time staff, he 
noted that the county Republican Party has had a full-time registration officer 
and other staff for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're talking about is a Democratic Party that is absolutely dead in the 
water in Orange County," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to bolster the Orange County Democrats resolved a dispute between 
county and state Democratic leaders over financing that has simmered for about 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The $25,000 dedicated by the state to the registration effort should generate 
about 10,000 additional Democratic voters in the district, Calfo said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are almost 89,000 Democrats and 77,000 Republicans in Dornan's 
38th Congressional district. There are about 50,000 Democrats and 40,000 
Republicans in Pringle's 72nd Assembly District.

GLITCH TIES HUGE AT&amp;T NETWORK IN KNOTS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: ABOUT HALF OF ALL LONG-DISTANCE CALLS THAT CUSTOMERS TRIED TO 
PLACE WERE BLOCKED. THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM TOOK HOURS TO CORRECT. 
</P>

<P>
If you tried to reach out on Monday, chances were about even that you did not 
touch anyone. 
</P>
<P>
A mysterious problem gripped AT&amp;T's giant long-distance network, making it 
impossible for many calls to get through. Instead, for hours on end, unlucky 
callers heard only a series of musical tones and the following tape recording: 
"All circuits are busy now. Please try your call later." 
</P>
<P>
The company said the problem was fixed by 8:30 p.m. PST, but spokeswoman Sally 
Sherwood said she could not provide any more details immediately on how the 
network was returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously through a very long, laborious process they were able to detect the 
problem and fix it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties were traced to software that runs computerized call-switching 
gear that AT&amp;T began installing in 1987, Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's diagnostic testing system first alerted the company to the problem 
around 11:30 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, engineers at the firm's Network Operations Center in 
Bedminster, N.J., figured they had isolated the problem in the utility's 
Signaling System Seven, a data network overlaying the talking path of telephone 
conversations. But it took several more hours to fix the system. 
</P>
<P>
Linda McDougall, a spokeswoman in AT&amp;T's Los Angeles office, explained that 
the SS7 network carries the calling number, the number called and the route of 
the call, but not the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
She estimated that the problem affected about half the calls that AT&amp;T 
customers were trying to make on public lines. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard-hit were companies that rely on 800 numbers to generate much 
of their business. At Avis car rental, for example, operators accustomed to 
juggling several calls per minute were staring at silent phones for as long as 
five minutes at a time. "We're not getting any calls," said one, who identified 
herself as Candy. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing computerization has given the phone system far more versatility, 
enabling it to handle a growing load of calls, faxes and computer hookups. Call 
forwarding, call waiting and other custom services are all products of this 
computerization. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T and the regional operating companies insist that these additional 
services have not come at the cost of less reliability, but some experts have 
warned that the more complex the software systems, the more likely they are to 
have bugs that may pop up without warning. 
</P>
<P>
On a normal business day, AT&amp;T's long-distance network, the nation's 
largest, handles between 80 million and 90 million calls. However, company 
officials said they believed the volume was significantly lower on Monday 
because of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. birthday holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Hyundai Motor America was among those bedeviled by the 
AT&amp;T glitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had major problems; we can't call out," said telecommunication manager 
Susie Nakao earlier in the day. "We just get all circuits busy." 
</P>
<P>
The company's high-speed data lines were still transmitting despite the 
failure, however, so employees increased use of an electronic messaging system 
to reach out from the Fountain Valley national headquarters to other Hyundai 
offices across the United States, Nakao said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell also suffered from the AT&amp;T failure because Pacific Bell's 
local operators were "bombarded" with phone calls from puzzled customers, 
according to Linda Bonniksen, a company spokeswoman in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Old habits die hard," Bonniksen said. The flood of calls came from AT&amp;T 
customers who punched zero once and connected with a local Pacific Bell 
operator instead of punching zero twice to reach an AT&amp;T operator. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, Al Harmon, owner of Aljo Fabric Protection 
Inc. of Van Nuys, said he was frustrated in a daylong effort to reach his 
distributor in Vacaville to tell him about an emergency that threatens a 
$16,000 to $18,000 fabric-protection contract with a Sacramento hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"My manufacturer has shorted me on some product, and I'm afraid we're going to 
lose the job, unless my distributor tells the customer that we're going to be a 
week or 10 days going in," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
He started telephoning his Vacaville distributor at 6:30 a.m. Monday and 
continued throughout the day without success, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not outraged, but, Lord, this is my business. All of it is done on the 
telephone . . . I'm going to stay on it until I'm beat or I succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that a number of heavy users of toll-free lines 
experienced problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheffield, phone systems manager for the Marriott hotels reservation 
office in Omaha, said the problem was "devastating" for her office because it 
wasn't receiving calls from prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
The office received only 10% of its normal call volume after the problem began, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Investments said callers had trouble getting through to the 
Boston-based mutual fund operator. "It did have quite extensive impact," said 
spokeswoman Tracy Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill in Ft. Worth said that after 11:30 
a.m. PST, the carrier experienced about two-thirds fewer calls than normal on 
its reservation lines. 
</P>
<P>
Trans Mid-America, a marketing company in Omaha, specializing in temporary 
motor vehicle license sales, could not make any long distance or 800-number 
calls, said Florence Waymire, a vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dead in the water here today," she said. The company has inbound and 
outbound telemarketing services, which "totally shuts us down." 
</P>
<P>
The problem did not affect the nation's other major long distance carriers, MCI 
Communications Corp. and US Sprint.

MILITARY: THE U.S. MAY BE PRESSURED TO PULL THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS OUT

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Czechoslovaks and the Soviet Union began sensitive military negotiations 
here Monday that could generate powerful -- and to, some Western strategists, 
unwelcome -- political pressure on the United States to pull tens of thousands 
of its troops out of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Czechoslovak and Soviet diplomatic, military and economic 
officials met at Czernin Palace to discuss the new Prague government's demand 
that the approximately 75,000 Soviet troops garrisoned here be withdrawn by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak officials insist that the issue has nothing to do with the 
superpower talks in Vienna on reducing the levels of Warsaw Pact and North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Europe. But a Western diplomatic source 
here said that if the Soviets comply with the Czechoslovak demand, "there will 
be tremendous pressure on us to start pulling out, too, and I'm not sure that's 
a good idea, strategically." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, with about 325,000 troops in West Germany, has the largest 
contingent of foreign troops among the NATO countries in Europe, but Canada and 
Britain also have a significant military presence on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Go-Slow Approach 
</P>
<P>
NATO favors a more measured reduction of troops along the line that has 
separated East and West in Europe since the end of World War II. It would 
prefer to spread withdrawals out over a two- or three-year period to preserve a 
degree of stability in the fast-changing political climate. 
</P>
<P>
While the Soviets have not commented publicly on the Czechoslovak demand, they, 
too, are believed to favor a phased withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops entered Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 1968, at the head of a Warsaw 
Pact invasion force that put an end to the Prague Spring reforms of Communist 
Party chief Alexander Dubcek. Their stay was legalized Oct. 16, 1968, by 
agreement between the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
The new Czechoslovak government, installed after last year's "velvet 
revolution," proposed Dec. 3 that talks begin on a withdrawal of the Soviet 
forces. The next day, Warsaw Pact leaders meeting in Moscow condemned the 1968 
invasion, adding moral weight to Prague's contention that the October, 1968, 
agreement was obtained by coercion and is therefore void. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, in the course of a Dec. 20 visit to Moscow by the Czechoslovak 
foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, agreed to discussions on the subject. And 
last week, in what was interpreted here as an opening shot in the talks, a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Prague wants the troops out by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hungarian officials called for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
that country by the end of 1990, but the talks that opened here Monday are 
believed to be the first formal negotiations on the subject between Moscow and 
one of its Warsaw Pact allies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very responsible but not easy job," Deputy Foreign Minister Evzen Vacek 
told an interviewer, commenting on his role as head of the Czechoslovak 
delegation to the talks. "I do hope it will be easier than I think." 
</P>
<P>
Other Czechoslovak sources said Prague wants Moscow to pull out up to half of 
its troops this spring and to commit itself to withdrawing the rest by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Early withdrawal would presumably be a major plus for candidates endorsed by 
the Civic Forum movement in national elections scheduled for June 8. Civic 
Forum, while ruling in coalition with the Communists, has clearly been setting 
the political agenda here since early last month. 
</P>
<P>
Dienstbier was Civic Forum's spokesman before he was named foreign minister; 
Vaclav Havel, who became Czechoslovakia's president on Dec. 29, was the 
movement's leader. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the Soviet garrison is clearly a popular issue. About 6,000 people 
demonstrated Sunday near the central Moravian town of Olomouc, where one of the 
largest Soviet contingents is garrisoned, calling for complete withdrawal by 
Aug. 21, the 22nd anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Residents told a Western reporter who visited the town over the weekend that 
they want about 600 apartments that are reserved for Soviets made available to 
Czechoslovaks. They also complained about a nearby military airfield. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimize Friction 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet troops are reportedly kept close to their barracks in an effort to 
minimize the possibility of friction with the Czechoslovaks. But in the center 
of Olomouc, they have a fenced compound that includes barracks, a hospital, 
stores and a school. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin withdrew a tank division from Czechoslovakia last year as part of a 
unilateral reduction involving about 50,000 troops from East Europe. It is 
expected to withdraw the equivalent of another division this year, according to 
diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations here are expected to continue today and possibly Wednesday. 
Czechoslovak officials said they hope the issue will be resolved at these 
meetings, but Western diplomats are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
The complexity of the talks was underlined by the presence, on both sides, of 
Finance and Interior ministry representatives.

The National Salvation Front, embattled and at times obviously confused, has 
been trying to maintain its credibility with the public and restore Romania's 
links with the mainstream community of European nations from which it has been 
cut off for nearly a generation. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a halting and difficult process, as events of the past few days 
have demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping unprepared into a world of violence and dislocation after the 
overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22, the front has had to deal 
with the inexperience of its leaders and what it perceives to be a threat of 
sabotage and killing by the survivors of Ceausescu's presidential guard. At the 
same time, it has had to respond to a society that is pressing for 
accountability from its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Amid public mutterings about the front's isolation and its method of announcing 
decrees from a Foreign Ministry building heavily guarded by the army, interim 
President Ion Iliescu decreed Friday that the Communist Party of Romania will 
be outlawed and that the death penalty will be restored for high officials of 
the old regime convicted of heinous crimes against the people. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, have already been executed, on Christmas Day, by 
a military firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
These decrees were issued in the face of a crowd gathered under suspicious 
circumstances, fueled by pint bottles of brandy handed around and -- it now 
seems apparent -- bent on discrediting the Council of the National Front. 
</P>
<P>
"These pronouncements were a mistake," Aurel Dragos Multianu, the front's chief 
spokesman, told a press conference Monday. He said the front met Saturday after 
the decrees were issued and decided that they were "hasty" and would be 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The front decided, he said, that a referendum will be held Jan. 28 to decide on 
the death penalty and whether the Communist Party is to be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are new at this," Multianu, who is also head of Romanian radio and 
television, told the reporters. "This is strange to us, and you must have 
patience, because we are learning." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's demonstration took place in the course of a national day of mourning 
for the thousands of people who are believed to have been killed in the 
fighting that raged across the country just before and after Ceausescu's flight 
from Bucharest on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Mayhem 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the crowd that went to the Foreign Ministry, where the 
interim government and the National Salvation Front make their headquarters, 
was determined to create a "provocation." 
</P>
<P>
"It was organized," said Silviu Brucan, a senior member of the front's 
11-member council. "We found hundreds of empty liquor bottles after the 
demonstration. According to our evidence, it was a provocation." 
</P>
<P>
It was remarkably effective. Responding to the demonstrators, Iliescu, Prime 
Minister Petre Roman and front Vice President Dumitru Mazilu went out to speak 
and were repeatedly shouted down. It was in this clamor that Iliescu replied to 
cries of "Death for death!" with his on-the-spot revocation of the death 
penalty and his banning of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Iliescu did not consult with anyone," Brucan said. "It was a terrible 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, military commanders in Timisoara, the cradle of the Romanian 
revolution, responded to a public outcry and took over the administration of 
the surrounding area until a new National Front leadership can be elected, 
probably within a week. Similar action was taken by the military commander in 
the northern town of Iasi. 
</P>
<P>
Brucan said that any prospect of a military takeover is "out of the question," 
but he acknowledged that military commanders are managing some sections of the 
Romanian economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the top officers of the military are excellent, and we need them now," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A continuing problem for the front is how to administer the country without 
turning to the Communist Party and elements of the secret police, the 
Securitate, which, under the old regime, held key positions in government and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spies Everywhere 
</P>
<P>
The Securitate was everywhere, according to Romanians and diplomats with long 
experience in the country. Every office and factory had a Securitate officer 
assigned to monitor the activities of employees and managers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, all managerial personnel in any office or factory had to be a member of 
the Communist Party. Thus, the front has had to rely on party members -- some 
of dubious reliability -- to keep the country functioning. 
</P>
<P>
The front has promised that there will be no "witch hunts" in the revolution's 
aftermath, but it realizes that many party members are scrambling for cover. 
Some of them, Romanians say, were innocently coerced into joining the party, 
while others were corrupt and used their positions for personal advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The public thirst for retribution is general. In any discussion with Romanians, 
the general opinion on Nicu Ceausescu, the elder son of the dictator, is that 
he should be shot as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The front has promised to put Ceausescu relatives on trial soon -- the exact 
number in custody has never been made public -- along with Ceausescu's most 
infamous henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
While a good section of the public could be expected to support the death 
penalty for most of these figures, liberals in the National Salvation Front are 
conscious of the opinion of Western nations, which would look upon such action 
with disapproval.

REFORMER ELECTED LITHUANIA'S PRESIDENT

Algirdas Brazauskas, the charismatic leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party, 
was elected president of Lithuania on Monday -- a strong vote of confidence in 
his defiant assertion of the Soviet republic's desire for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, 57, was elected by a vote of 228 to 4 with 19 abstentions in the 
Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, the Baltic republic's legislature, according to 
Tass, the official Soviet news agency. He succeeds Vytautas Astrauskas, 59, who 
resigned because of poor health. 
</P>
<P>
Although two candidates of the Lithuanian Sajudis nationalist movement were 
also nominated, Brazauskas' popularity ensured his election. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, who has been first secretary of the Lithuanian party since October, 
1988, strongly supported its decision last month to break from the Soviet 
Communist Party and seek the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings from Moscow that this split -- the first real break from the 
Soviet Communist Party since the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917 -- would 
undercut President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his reform program, Brazauskas 
passionately defended the move as Gorbachev argued for its reversal in 
Lithuania last week. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas' election as president had been planned in order to strengthen his 
position in dealing with Moscow by dramatizing the personal support he has and 
by giving him additional stature as head of the state as well as the party. 
</P>
<P>
The step also ensures that if the Soviet Communist Party should expel 
Brazauskas in an attempt to halt the Lithuanian pullout, as demanded by 
conservative members of its policy-making Central Committee, he will still be 
president of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, an engineer, worked on a number of major construction projects in 
Lithuania before becoming the republic's construction minister in 1967, then 
first deputy chairman of the government planning commission and later a party 
secretary overseeing the republic's economy. 
</P>
<P>
As Sajudis began in mid-1988 to organize Lithuanians into one of the strongest 
political movements in the Soviet Union outside the Communist Party, Brazauskas 
began to reposition the Lithuanian party to respond to the same popular demands 
for national sovereignty, economic autonomy, environmental protection and 
greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the party leadership from men opposed even to Gorbachev's 
more gradual reform, Brazauskas has put Lithuania in the forefront of the 
Soviet Union's political and economic transformation as well as pursuing 
Lithuanians' dream of recovering their independence.

RALPHS STORES NOT AFFECTED BY SISTER FIRMS' BANKRUPTCY 
</P>

Ralphs Grocery Co. will not be affected by the bankruptcy filings of sister 
companies Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., company 
spokesmen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of the Southern California supermarket chain say that Ralphs is 
insulated from the financial problems that have beset Toronto-based Campeau 
Corp. and its Allied and Federated subsidiaries, which filed for protection 
under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs was not included in the filings. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will change in our stores," said Byron Allumbaugh, Ralphs' chairman. 
"We are in a very strong, independent position. To our customers, we will look 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Campeau, which acquired Ralphs as part of its 1988 takeover of Federated, owns 
Ralphs' common stock through its subsidiaries. But Ralphs, which was spun off 
from Federated, has its own debt, lines of credit and corporate structure, 
which allow it to stand alone from the rest of Campeau and its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Allumbaugh said, the grocery company does not need funds from 
Campeau, and Campeau and its affiliates are prohibited from removing any funds 
from Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ralphs executives denied rumors to a group of 400 suppliers that the 
supermarket chain was about to file for bankruptcy protection. Allumbaugh told 
the suppliers that Ralphs cut its losses from $72.6 million in fiscal 1988 to 
about $31 million in fiscal 1989, which ends on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The company projects a net loss of $7 million in the coming year, followed by a 
$17-million profit in fiscal 1991.

SOVIET MILITARY THREAT STILL LINGERS, CHENEY DECLARES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, laying the groundwork for the Pentagon's 
forthcoming $295-billion budget request, warned Monday of a continued Soviet 
military threat to Western Europe and declared that American forces must remain 
strong to "help shield the democracies against the possibility that the current 
favorable climate will be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech peppered with partisan language, Cheney said that the Western 
allies' resolve to stand up against the Soviets "was much stronger than 
appeared to the merchants of malaise" -- a reference to the Jimmy Carter 
Administration -- and said this resolve helped bring about changes in Soviet 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
In comments prepared for delivery at Houston's Forum Club, Cheney called on the 
Western allies to maintain their strength in the face of the Soviets' "vast 
military resources," including 17 Soviet divisions that remain in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's remarks come as the Bush Administration prepares to unveil its 1991 
defense budget request on Capitol Hill later this month -- a blueprint that 
would shrink the Pentagon budget, after accounting for inflation, by 2% yearly 
for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers, noting that the Pentagon budget has been declining by an 
average of 2% after inflation since 1985, have called for a far greater "peace 
dividend" in light of the dramatic changes sweeping Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Since more than 50% of the U.S. defense budget traditionally has been devoted 
to the defense of Western Europe, many analysts believe there are much bigger 
savings to be gained now that the military threat to Western Europe has faded. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has said that by demonstrating his willingness to make reductions, he 
hopes to lead lawmakers in a nonpartisan debate on defense priorities and to 
forestall deeper cuts. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in preparing to defend his spending plans, the defense chief 
is using many of the same rhetorical devices of his predecessors, including 
references to a Soviet military threat that many analysts now consider 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Launching the opening salvo of what is expected to be this year's most 
controversial debate on Capitol Hill, Cheney rejected Democrats' claims that 
cuts in defense spending will provide significant savings that can be applied 
to other government programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some defense critics, apparently astonished by this change (in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe), seem to suggest that the U.S. had better take the 
money and run -- offer unilateral cuts in our force strength, cash in the 
so-called peace dividend and come home," said Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would suggest instead (that) . . . peace is the dividend," he added. " . 
. . If a strong force structure is needed to keep the peace, it is even more 
important to promote the climate of stability in which further positive change 
can occur."

GENE THERAPY PROVIDES INTERNAL BAND-AID; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY THE TECHNIQUE IS A STEP TOWARD REDUCING RISK OF HEART 
ATTACKS AND STROKES.

<P>
Michigan doctors have succeeded in using genetically altered cells to act as an 
internal Band-Aid, a technique that eventually might be used to prevent 
atherosclerotic lesions from worsening, it was reported here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the work so far has been done only in animals, and with genes that do 
not produce biologically active products, the research represents a leap toward 
gene therapy to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the president of the 
American Heart Assn. told science writers. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan work is generating much excitement among cardiovascular 
researchers because it "points out to them the potential for broadly moving 
their field and other fields forward," Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel, assistant professor of medicine at the University of 
Michigan, reported at the meeting that her research group had used a common 
cardiovascular technique -- balloon angioplasty -- to insert genetically 
engineered cells into the arteries of Yucatan mini-pigs. 
</P>
<P>
The group infected endothelial cells -- which line the interior of the blood 
vessels -- that had been taken from the pigs earlier with a retrovirus that had 
itself been altered with a bacterial gene. Because a retrovirus inserts its own 
genetic code into infected cells, the enzyme-producing bacterial gene became 
part of the pig cells' genetic machinery. 
</P>
<P>
The altered cells were inserted into the pig artery through a balloon catheter. 
There they established a healing layer of endothelial cells over the 
atherosclerotic lesion, which is an accumulation of fat-filled cells on the 
artery wall. The layer successfully produced the bacterial enzyme, showing that 
a foreign gene could work in this way, Nabel said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of problems that other proposed gene therapies have had in obtaining 
results, Nabel was cautiously optimistic. "We have established the feasibility 
of using endothelial cells as factories for artery repair," Nabel said. 
</P>
<P>
The endothelial cells eventually might be modified to secrete anti-clotting 
proteins to prevent blockage of the artery at atherosclerotic plaque sites. 
Noting that plaques themselves produce substances that promote their own 
growth, Nabel said the endothelial Band-Aid might also contain genes to block 
these growth promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Since endothelial cells are in organs throughout the body, she added, these 
designer cells might even be engineered to produce anti-cancer drugs at tumor 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she called such applications "pie in the sky," and said she did not 
expect the research to bear clinical fruit for perhaps 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for that is the extensive safety monitoring that would have 
to be done before such techniques could be used in humans, she said. 
Retroviruses would have to be shown unable to cause harmful infection before 
they could be used in humans. The inserted genes would also need to have only a 
localized effect, so they would not harm other body systems. 
</P>
<P>
Weisfeldt, however, said he thought that if the technique proves promising, it 
might be usable early on in people for whom there is no other hope of survival. 
For instance, heart transplant patients often develop life-threatening 
atherosclerosis a few years after transplant as a result of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Endothelial cells have become a prime target for genetic engineers because 
their location inside the blood vessel ensures that hormones or other 
biological agents they produce will be distributed throughout the body. They 
are also easier to work with than bone marrow cells, which had previously been 
the target of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Geneticists around the country are already experimenting in animals with 
altered endothelial cells that deliver CD4, a protein that blocks the AIDS 
virus; a clotting factor to prevent excessive bleeding in hemophilia; adenosine 
deaminate, which is missing in children with certain genetic disorders of the 
immune system; and von Willebrand's factor, which cures another genetic 
bleeding disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers speculate the technique could also be used to produce tissue 
plasminogen activator, which would prevent the formation of blood clots that 
cause strokes and heart attacks, and even insulin for diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Most researchers agree that several years will elapse before attempts are made 
at human therapy by genetic engineering. To date, genetically engineered cells 
have been introduced into only a handful of humans as part of an anti-cancer 
therapy devised at the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, researchers there used genetic engineering techniques to insert 
markers into white blood cells that are used in therapy of malignant melanoma, 
a particularly severe form of skin cancer, to help track the cells through the 
body. A total of 10 patients are to be treated, and so far no ill effects from 
the genetically engineered cells have been observed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REPAIRING INJURED ARTERIES 
</P>
<P>
In miniature pigs, scientists at the University of Michigan used this 
two-ballon technique to insert replacements for the injured cell layer that 
normally lines the arteries, but which is damaged in atherosclerosis. Because 
the inserted cells successfully produced an enzyme that they had been 
genetically altered to make, the researchers see the angioplasty technique -- 
already used to unblock arteries in humans -- as a potential way to both repair 
injured artery walls and make them produce lesion-inhibiting proteins that 
would reverse or prevent further atherosclerosis.

KELLY GEARS UP FOR 1ST REELECTION BID

<P>
Councilman John Kelly, a key figure on the tumultuous City Council, says his 
Irish blood has served him well in local politics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old saying that an Irishman's heart is not at peace unless he's in 
the middle of a fight," Kelly said. "That could be true." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who waged four campaigns before being elected to the City Council in 
1986, now faces a fight: his first try at reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Because Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey resigned last year and Councilwoman 
Ursula E. Kennedy recently announced she will not seek reelection, Kelly is the 
only incumbent vying for one of the three seats to be filled in April. Although 
the filing period for those seats just opened, four people so far have taken 
out papers to run. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, 28, is setting up campaign headquarters in a former tobacco shop next to 
the tuxedo shop he now runs. Kelly's campaigns, which included an unsuccessful 
bid for Congress in 1988, have been somewhat unconventional. He has driven a 
red, white and blue Cadillac, sung "Let Me Call You Sweetheart" to a group of 
senior citizens and hired an elephant to ride on El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
His non-campaign antics have included singing during council meetings, bringing 
Orange County's Pope look-alike to a meeting and staking out the home of a 
council member whose legal resident status he and Councilman Earl J. Prescott 
challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
A staunchly conservative, outspoken Republican with a penchant for good cigars, 
Kelly has drawn harsh criticism from some of his council colleagues and members 
of the Tustin Residents Action Committee, a group that plans to support several 
candidates in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be aggressively exposing John Kelly, and also Earl Prescott, 
to show the public that we feel they are using the office for political gain," 
said Carl Kasalek, chairman of TRAC. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has been known to lambaste council colleagues and audience members, 
calling people "battle ax" or "twit" on occasion. He has been called impetuous 
and immature by residents, who chastise him at meetings or write letters to a 
local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott, who often sides with Kelly on issues that divide the council, said, 
"All I can say is that his heart's in the right place and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who left high school after his junior year to work in one of the family 
businesses, said he is concerned with protecting the rights of owners of small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
His other goals include making sure redevelopment money is used for streets and 
sidewalks instead of private real estate developments, and trying to control 
noise from planes approaching John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want Tustin to end up like Inglewood," he said, suggesting that the 
city buy its own sound-monitoring equipment rather than rely on the county to 
monitor noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly first threw his hat into the political arena after the family ran into 
obstacles with the Planning Commission when trying to renovate the family 
businesses clustered between El Camino Real and C Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the council meetings when I was 16 years old with my dad and I saw 
council members there that were totally unsympathetic to what he wanted to do. 
They were going by the prescribed bureaucratic recommendations at the state 
level or whatever," Kelly said. SHANNON SANDS

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER RATE ROSE 50% IN 1989, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An upswing in gang violence and drug dealing caused Inglewood's murder rate to 
rise 50% last year, making 1989 the second-deadliest year in the city's 
history, according to year-end estimates released last week by the Inglewood 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported 46 murders in the city last year, compared to the record 55 
reported in 1980. At the same time, the number of shootings involving Inglewood 
police officers more than tripled, rising from three in 1988 to 11 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In part, police attributed that increase to gangs and drugs. "We are 
aggressively attacking gangs and drugs on our streets," Sgt. Harold Moret said. 
"We are going to have police officer-criminal conflicts."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT DROPPED IN MAN'S JAIL CELL DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relatives of a construction worker who was found hanged in his Torrance jail 
cell in 1988 have dropped their highly publicized lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Paper work requesting dismissal of the case was filed in Torrance Superior 
Court last week, ending a lengthy battle by 27-year-old Timothy McCauley's 
family to prove that he did not commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the dismissal came after the city agreed not to 
seek legal costs from the family. "I think they realized there really was no 
case there," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
McCauley's father, Donald, insisted in a brief telephone interview that the 
case did have merit, but declined to comment on why he had decided not to 
pursue it further. 
</P>
<P>
McCauley was found dead in his cell the day after his arrest for traffic 
violations and fleeing. A sling he'd been given for a shoulder injury was 
around his neck.

PEEP SHOWS STILL NOT UP TO CODE, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The continuing struggle between operators of peep shows and the city of Garden 
Grove took another turn Monday as four video arcades complied with a court 
order to remove the doors on interior booths -- but replaced them with 
curtains. 
</P>
<P>
"They've taken down the doors but put up curtains, and that's absolutely not in 
compliance with the municipal code," said City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart B. Scudder. Code enforcement officers Monday inspected five peep shows 
on Garden Grove Boulevard for compliance with an order issued by Superior Court 
Judge John C. Wooley on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The businesses that replaced doors with curtains are the Bijou, the A-Z 
Bookstore, the Garden of Eden Bookstore and Hip Pocket Bookstore. A fifth, the 
Adult Bookstore, complied with the court order. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give them until the afternoon (today), and if the curtains are still 
there, they'll be cited for violating the municipal code," Scudder said. Garden 
Grove has a "peep show" ordinance regulating the video arcade businesses, which 
typically charge 25 cents to view a snippet of an X-rated film. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of the doors avoids the threat of a contempt citation from the 
court and may lead to another round of legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Scudder is wasting his time and the taxpayers' money," said Roger 
Diamond, an attorney representing the arcades. "The judge's concern was with 
safety, that somehow a person might get locked in a booth in the event of a 
fire. These curtains are easily pushed aside." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's ordinance, passed in 1983 and revised in 1988, also requires 
that exit signs be visible to all users of the booths, and sets other standards 
such as minimum booth sizes and aisle widths. JAMES TORTOLANO

UNITED WAY PLEDGES REACH 95% OF GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than two weeks remaining in its 1989-90 fund-raising campaign, the 
United Way of Orange County has reported pledges totaling $19.5 million, or 
about 95% of its goal. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Chairman Ron Merriman said the fund drive has exceeded last year's 
$18.6-million pledge total and could surpass this year's goal of $20.5 million 
before it ends Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The community has rallied behind the campaign, and the result is more dollars 
pledged to the United Way fund drive than at any time in Orange County 
history," Merriman said.

PLAN TO MOVE AUTO SALVAGE FIRM DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After about five hours of discussion before a capacity crowd, the city Planning 
Commission voted unanimously Monday against a proposal to allow Pick Your Part 
auto yard to move from Stanton to the site of a defunct landfill and vacant 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 residents living in Anaheim and Buena Park neighborhoods next to the 
lot donned matching yellow T-shirts and crowded the chambers to protest 
rezoning the area for commercial use, which would allow the wrecking yard to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have a strong feeling that if a project like this were proposed 
in your back yard, you would be standing where I am today," Phil Steyerman, 
representative of the Stop Pick Your Part Committee, a homeowners group, told 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Thomas F. Brown, who lives north of the site on Lincoln 
Avenue just east of Beach Boulevard, said: "Everybody knows what a garbage 
truck sounds like. Well, imagine one parked outside your home for eight hours a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the rezoning plan presented videos, slides and artists' 
renditions of the revamped lot, hoping to prove to worried residents and the 
commission that rezoning the area for industrial use wouldn't necessarily make 
the area an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
One environmental consultant distributed to committee members samples of 
various types of foliage that would be used to decorate the lot to keep it from 
looking like an ordinary junkyard. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick Your Part is a recycling yard," said Kent Spieller, another consultant 
for the auto yard. "It's not your typical junkyard." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Schwartze, a real estate consultant and a main spokesman for the 
proponents, said he was unsure if Pick Your Part would take the matter to the 
City Council, but insisted that something needs to be done with the vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really struggled to try to figure out what to do with this," he said. 
"The neighbors don't like change, and that's what we're trying to do." LISA

FULL-TIME GRAFFITI REMOVER CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang markers, names, racial epithets and pornographic phrases sprayed on walls, 
overpasses and elsewhere have become a $5,000-a-month headache in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The cost has increased so much recently that the city would save money by 
hiring a full-time worker to remove graffiti rather than continue contracting 
with a company to do it, Community Services Director Ronald E. Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We (used to) have the contractor come out once every week or once every two 
weeks," Hagan said. "Now we're having them come out two or three times a week, 
at a minimum, and we're still getting a backlog." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the City Council will consider Hagan's request to hire a worker and to 
buy a truck and other equipment for the graffiti-removal effort. That should 
cost about $34,000 for the remaining six months of the city's fiscal year. The 
projected annual cost is $52,000, or about $4,300 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The city employee should be able to remove graffiti within two days after it is 
reported, rather than the current seven to 10 days, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to open a hot line for city residents to report graffiti 
and to introduce an anti-graffiti program at local schools and community 
centers, he said. TOM McQUEENEY

PEOPLE: FOSTER MOTHER MAKES CAREER OF CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 43, Tina Devonald is a devoted mother. She vows that "until my children are 
grown, my life is theirs." 
</P>
<P>
The way things are going, that may be a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her own five children ranging in age from 10 to 21, Devonald has been a 
foster mother in recent years to 50 others from the Holy Family Adoption 
Services in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at a soccer game eight years ago when someone told me about being a 
foster mother with the adoption agency," said Devonald, "and I really got 
excited. I even think our soccer team won that day." 
</P>
<P>
After discussing it with her family, she filled out the forms and waited a year 
before the agency gave her a foster child. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a perennial mom," said Devonald, who married Frank Devonald, 
an Irvine computer management consultant, right out of high school. She said 
she feels "it is unfortunate that many young couples can't afford to have a mom 
at home." Devonald's mother died when she was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the backing of her children, "my husband is very supportive of me. He 
knows this is my niche in life." 
</P>
<P>
"I love what I am doing," said the Fullerton mother who has yet to hire a 
baby-sitter for any of the foster children. "These children need one-on-one 
care. These children need love all the time, and I don't want to leave them." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "I go everywhere with them," she continued. "I take them to football 
games when my daughter is cheering and soccer games when my other daughter is 
playing. I have a twin stroller, so it's sort of like 'Have babies, will 
travel.' " 
</P>
<P>
She currently has two foster children in her home. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Devonald has taken some of the foster children with her while she 
goes horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the babies, too," she said, adding: "I've always loved newborn 
infants and started baby-sitting when I was only 10. I liked to take care of 
little children." 
</P>
<P>
While she gets paid from the agency for foster parenting, "it never does cover 
the expenses of caring for them, but to me it's really worthwhile," Devonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently she was given newborns that came from broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
"My own children learn through experience how to deal with young children," she 
said. One reason she decided to become a foster parent was so her own children 
would "see what could happen if they got involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike her own children, "At least we don't have to put them through 
college," she said. "These newborns come into our house and we enjoy them from 
day to day. Next week it might change." 
</P>
<P>
The time frame changes from baby to baby -- some have stayed just two weeks, 
while others have stayed a year. 
</P>
<P>
While she is caring for the infants, "I know it will hurt when they leave. But 
I know there will be another one out there that will need me as much." 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Lukes, 87, managed to leave Czechoslovakia 10 years ago and set up a new 
life and home in San Clemente with his wife, Frantiska. Their sons Paul and 
Rudy live in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf and his brother Hugo Lukes, 79, who still lives in Czechoslovakia, are 
the only remaining siblings from a family of 10. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, one son took Rudolf to Los Angeles International Airport to 
supposedly pick up the other son as he arrived from a flight. To Rudolf's 
surprise, however, it was Hugo who stepped off the plane. It was the first time 
the two had seen each other in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had first checked with our father's doctor to make sure it was all right to 
surprise him," said Paul, who pointed out his father has had five heart bypass 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
After an emotional meeting, the brothers went to Rudolf's home to talk about 
politics in Czechoslovakia and catch up on lost time. 
</P>
<P>
"Disneyland is on their agenda," Paul said. "Anyone who comes to Southern 
California has to go to Disneyland." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build 141 houses on 30 acres of bamboo-covered property adjacent 
to Trabuco Creek will be discussed at a special Planning Commission workshop at 
7 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents have opposed development in the area because it would destroy 
part of the thick foliage around Trabuco Creek, which environmentalists say is 
an important bird habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The project, known as "Pepperwood Estates," calls for construction of 
single-family homes, a departure from earlier plans that included an apartment 
building near the north end of Alipaz Street. The developer is J.E. Butler 
&amp; Associates of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be in Room 2 of the Lacouague Building at the Old Fire Station 
Complex, 31421 La Matanza St.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: LEWIS DOESN'T LET TROUBLES STAND IN HIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rashone Lewis has shown that he can stay with something until it is 
accomplished. But he also knows a little something about the alternative -- 
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Lewis, a sophomore at Fullerton College, has had to 
deal with much more than the average problems of a college basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
When Lewis arrived at Cal State Fullerton in 1987, he was academically 
ineligible. A year later, the coach who recruited him resigned. 
</P>
<P>
But even at Fullerton College, things haven't gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 6-foot-6 forward, is having a strong season, averaging 19.1 points and 
8.7 rebounds. But in December, starting sophomore forward Mike Goff collapsed 
at his house and died. The cause of death has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The day of Goff's death, starting guard Donell Henderson left the team because 
of poor conduct on the court. Henderson was unaware of Goff's death at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lewis has had to shoulder much of the team's offensive burden. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hanging in there," said Lewis of Fullerton (9-13 overall, 0-3 Orange 
Empire Conference), which has lost five of six games. "But it's been really 
hard for everyone. Sure, I'm doing pretty well, but what does that mean? The 
team is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
Off and on the court, the loss of Goff has taken its toll on Fullerton and 
Coach Roger See. "We all miss him a lot," See said. "It was the first time a 
lot of our players have had to deal with death. 
</P>
<P>
"We all felt the loss personally. Now we're feeling the loss on the court as 
well. A lot of the burden has fallen to Rashone and he has done pretty well. 
He's our only player averaging in double figures." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' troubles started at Cal State Fullerton when he was a freshman in 1987. 
He was academically ineligible after coming out of Verbum Dei High School. He 
became eligible one year later, but then Coach George McQuarn resigned, and was 
succeeded by current Coach John Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis played sparingly in 24 games, averaging 1.3 points and two rebounds. He 
left the team before the end of the season, upset about his lack of playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got totally frustrated," Lewis said. "I didn't want to be around the 
campus anymore. . . . But I don't blame Coach Sneed. He had a lot of pressure 
on him to win and he did what he thought he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis stopped going to his four classes as well, but he still was surprised he 
had received an F in each one. He thought he had withdrawn from his classes. 
</P>
<P>
So Lewis went back to each teacher and officially was withdrawn from each 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lewis took 15 units of core classes this summer at two colleges so he 
could be eligible at Fullerton College. Attending classes and studying kept 
Lewis busy from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. four days a week for six weeks. Two days 
before the start of the season, Lewis had all his paper work in order so he 
could play for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a lot of leg work just to play," See said. "There were times when it 
looked like he might not make it, but he kept telling me that he would handle 
it, and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Hamelin goes big time: Bob Hamelin, the former Rancho Santiago standout, has 
made his first appearance on a major league baseball card this month as a 
rookie in the 1990 set of Upper Deck cards. 
</P>
<P>
Hamelin, an Irvine High School graduate, played at UCLA for a season, then at 
Rancho Santiago in 1988 before becoming the second-round pick of the Kansas 
City Royals in June. 
</P>
<P>
There's one interesting omission in Hamelin's biography on the back of the 
card. According to the card, "Bob spent only two years with the Bruins then was 
drafted . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In other words, there is no mention of his time at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Hamelin set state records with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs, and 
batted .521 with 95 runs scored in 48 games, it might have been worth a 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the first time Hamelin has had trouble with a baseball card. 
</P>
<P>
On his first card when he was at Eugene, his name was spelled "Hamblin" on the 
front of the card. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback offensive lineman Mark Esposito, who was going to attend the 
University of Hawaii, has changed his mind and instead will go to Cal State 
Long Beach . . . Saddleback defensive back Robby Smith and offensive 
lineman/linebacker Steve Jones have agreed to attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
. . . The men's state basketball championships will be at UC Irvine this 
season, March 8-10. The women will play for the state title at College of the 
Sequoias March 1-3.

FIRST 9 MONTHS OF '89 WERE LUCRATIVE FOR COUNTY BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's 39 banks posted a combined $41.9 million in net income for the 
first nine months last year, earning more than they did for all of 1988, 
according to recently released statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The unaudited profits -- 38% higher than the $30.3 million earned during the 
same nine-month period in 1988 -- put the local banks on track to record their 
third consecutive profitable year. Audited results for all of last year won't 
be available until late March. 
</P>
<P>
For the entire year of 1988, the local banks reported $41.4 million in net 
income. 
</P>
<P>
"All indications we have are that 1989 was an excellent year through the fourth 
quarter," said Gerry Findley, a Brea banking consultant. "It was probably the 
best year we've had in independent banking in a long time. Anybody who couldn't 
make it in '89 was sure as hell doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
He cautions, however, that this year's bank earnings won't be "nearly as 
strong" as last year's. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the county's small thrift and loan industry continues to fare well as 
13 local thrifts operating under banking regulations earned $9.4 million in 
combined profits for the first nine months. Results for five other thrifts not 
yet regulated by banking authorities were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts, state-chartered institutions that are sort of a hybrid between banks 
and finance companies, are required by state law to obtain federal insurance 
for their deposits by July 1. Thrift and loans, known by that name only in 
California, sometimes are confused with the nation's savings and loans, which 
often are called thrifts, also. 
</P>
<P>
For the period that ended Sept. 30, only two county banks -- Laguna Bank in 
Laguna Beach and American Interstate Bank in Newport Beach -- lost money. And 
their losses -- $242,000 and $54,000, respectively -- were small compared to 
the millions of dollars lost by nearly two dozen local banks in the early- and 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Of the profitable banks, 16 reported earnings of more than $1 million, and only 
three recorded profits of less than $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Alex Sheshunoff, head of Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., the Austin, 
Tex., firm that compiled the quarterly results from regulatory statistics, 
warned that earnings often do not reflect underlying problems like slow-paying 
or non-paying loans. 
</P>
<P>
One indication of such problems, he maintains, is the percentage of a bank's 
non-performing loans to its total loans. A bank should not have more than 3% of 
its loans classified as non-performing, he said. Most bankers try to keep that 
figure below 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Seven county banks had ratios higher than 3% at the end of the third quarter, 
with Commercial Center Bank in Santa Ana at 12.48% and Mission Valley Bank in 
San Clemente at 7.46% heading the list. A year earlier, only six county banks 
were above the 3% level. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift and loans insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have continued 
to prosper. Only one county thrift -- Orange Coast T&amp;L in Los Alamitos -- 
has failed in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Four thrifts must obtain FDIC insurance in the next six months or face 
regulatory action against them. A fifth one, Chase Manhattan of California 
Thrift Corp., is no longer acting as a full-service thrift. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months, only one thrift, Franklin T&amp;L in Orange, lost 
money. But like other thrifts, Franklin has sufficient capital to meet 
regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY BANK SCOREBOARD 
</P>
<P>
Asset and net income figures for Orange County banks as of Sept. 30, 1989, show 
that banks earned more in the first nine months than in the entire previous 
year. Sixteen banks earned more than $1 million.

VLADIVOSTOK STRUGGLES TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT; 
</P>

SOVIET FAR EAST: AILING INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN EFFORTS TO 
MAKE THE REGION AN ECONOMIC BRIDGE LINKING THE SOVIET UNION WITH PACIFIC RIM 
NATIONS.

VLADIVOSTOK, U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese television producer, frustrated in his attempts to communicate with 
counterparts in the Soviet East Asian capital of Vladivostok, gave two fax 
machines to the local television station in July. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice try, but Hiroshi Kikuchi's gift failed to remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to Japan, he found telephone lines were so poor he could not 
get through to his fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
Serious gaps in services and facilities in the Soviet Far East are a major 
stumbling block in efforts to make the region an economic bridge linking the 
Soviet Union with the rapidly expanding Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev envisioned Vladivostok becoming "our widely 
opened window on the East" in a major policy speech in the city in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has since agreed to open Vladivostok to foreign travelers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which serves as home port to the Soviet Pacific Fleet, has been 
closed for decades under a cloak of military secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the opening, Vladivostok has invited selected businessmen 
for a preview. 
</P>
<P>
Their aim is to encourage foreign firms to locate factories in the area to 
process their natural resources -- coal, timber and fish -- rather than just 
shipping them off, as is now the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Today the task is not to sell raw materials but to sell manufactured 
products," said Victor Tikhomirov, chief of the foreign economic affairs 
department for the Primorsky region. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an obsession about value-added processing," said an American 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Vladivostok hosted more than 400 foreign business delegations in 1989, a 
government official said. 
</P>
<P>
Most were Chinese, but several were from America, Japan, South Korea, 
Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard Co. discussed the possibility of building a computer plant, 
city officials said. Toyota representatives checked out conditions for 
automobile assembly, and Alaska Airlines spoke of a flight from Anchorage to 
Vladivostok, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But their interest has not gone beyond the talking stage. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they want people to come but how can you do business without a fax 
machine," asked a Japanese businessman after a recent visit to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation is bad," he continued. "Delivery is a problem. They run out of 
materials. Workers quit because they cannot improve their life style no matter 
how much they earn." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the capital, labor or infrastructure to turn out products," 
said an American executive in the timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of bureaucracy," he said, adding that uncertainty over whether 
the Soviet Union's new openness will continue adds risk to any venture. 
</P>
<P>
Against those odds, it seems unlikely Vladivostok will ever attract heavy 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's leaders have launched a sincere drive to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working at those problems now," said Valery Lozovoy, who heads up the 
city's foreign trade initiative. "We know we cannot improve international 
contacts without improving our infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
Their first task, they believe, is to win more economic freedom from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet East Asians have grown tired of watching their vast stock of 
resources being sold off and the profits shipped to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
They want the central government to back off and let them plow the profits from 
foreign and domestic sales into their sorely lacking infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 1.5% of the profits from the export of timber have been returned to the 
region," said Igor Sukhachev, head of the regional ministry of external 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
On average, only about 20% of the profits are returned to the region, but 
Moscow has recently agreed to increase that figure to between 30% and 80%, 
Sukhachev said. 
</P>
<P>
The city leaders have begun studying ways to rebuild the airport and 
communications systems, two areas in desperate need of new funds. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty miles east of Vladivostok, a free economic zone is set to open in 1990 at 
the deep sea port of Nadhodka. 
</P>
<P>
Special tax incentives will be extended to foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
But again, lack of services, bureaucratic interference and a problematic work 
force raise serious doubts about the success of the venture.

PANEL TO HEAR WAYS TO CHANGE THE AHMANSON; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE COMMITTEE WILL MEET TODAY TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO RENOVATE THE 
THEATER AFTER 'PHANTOM' CLOSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the box office booming for "The Phantom of the Opera," the Ahmanson 
Theatre may not look as if it needs to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, a committee will listen to proposals for how to make the 
Ahmanson a better theater, after "The Phantom" has become a mere phantom. 
</P>
<P>
That might not happen for a long time. A "Phantom" spokesman said "there is no 
sign of its slowing down" in Los Angeles and no date for its departure. Still, 
the theater's managers want to be ready when the big day arrives. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has been criticized for years -- by actors and audience members as 
well as critics -- for the effect of its size and acoustics on spoken drama. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Foundation contributed $100,000 to pay for the first formal 
proposals of what to do with the theater. Three architectural firms and one 
London-based theatrical consulting firm will make presentations today, and a 
London theater manager also has been asked for his advice. 
</P>
<P>
If renovation plans proceed, the ultimate goal is not quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
Actor and committee member Charlton Heston, who has appeared in eight shows at 
the Ahmanson, is so adamant about improving it for spoken drama that he wants 
to remove the orchestra pit altogether -- "I don't think we'll ever do musicals 
again in the Ahmanson," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The spoken-drama advocates would like to see the 2,071-seat auditorium reduced 
-- and all of the proposals, said Heston, would provide for a degree of 
convertibility, so that the theater could change its seating capacity, 
depending on the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Within the proposals, said Heston, are plans that could shrink the hall to as 
few as 800 seats, or expand it to 2,400. He favors a capacity of 1,000-1,200 -- 
assuming, that is, that a larger house isn't required for the blockbuster 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet committee member Charles Schneider, chairman of the Music Center Operating 
Company (MCOC), cautioned against assuming that musicals will disappear along 
with "The Phantom," pointing out that the next London musical spectacular, 
"Miss Saigon," probably could bring a lot of money into the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got people coming to the Music Center (for 'Phantom') who have never 
been there before," he said, "and while they're there, they might buy a ticket 
to the Taper, the Chorale, the Philharmonic." The main problem with leaving the 
Ahmanson open for long-running "Phantom"-like extravaganzas, he said, is 
figuring out where to put the Ahmanson subscription audience, which has been 
diverted to the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood for the duration of the 
"Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
The committee that will review the proposals is led by TV producer Douglas 
Cramer, a member of the Center Theatre Group (CTG) board. It also includes five 
other members of the CTG board, two other officers (besides Schneider) of the 
MCOC, and Robert Ahmanson of the Ahmanson Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no commitments for financing" beyond the $100,000 spent on the 
proposals, said CTG President Lawrence Ramer. "We couldn't go out and seek 
money until we knew how much the ballpark figures are (in the proposals)." 
</P>
<P>
Said one of the architects who has prepared a proposal: "The question we all 
have is: How real is it? There is no commitment that anything will happen." 
Another of the architects, however, predicted that "big, exciting changes" are 
in store for the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
Those who will present their ideas at today's meeting include: 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbe Becket, the architectural firm that is descended from the firm of the 
late Welton Becket, the Music Center's original architect. None of the 
individuals who worked on Welton Becket's original plans will be involved in 
the firm's latest proposal, and the company's design principal, Lou Naidorf, 
said he is open to the idea of changing the original design: " A lot of 
improvements need to be made, and we think they can be." However, he added, 
"for the most part, the city has been pleased with the Music Center, and it's 
natural that we should come back in" for a remodeling proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer -- a New York-based firm with a Los Angeles office 
which has done work for Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Los Angeles 
Public Library, and theaters in Eugene, Ore., Anchorage, Alaska, Denver and 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Barton Myers, a Hollywood-based architect who worked for 20 years in Canada and 
recently designed the Cerritos Community Arts Center. "I understand I am still 
controversial with some Music Center people," said Myers, because of his 
preliminary study for what was to become the Music Center's new Disney Hall. 
Myers suggested placing the building at the top of the Civic Center Mall, to 
the east of the Center, instead of the location that was selected to the south 
of the Center. If Myers' Ahmanson proposal is selected, he plans to do the work 
in conjunction with Theatre Projects, a London-based theater design consulting 
firm, which also was invited to submit its own independent proposal to the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned Theatre Projects, which has advised on the planning of 
theaters in 28 countries, including seven national theaters, Cerritos Community 
Arts Center, Whittier College Performing Arts Center and the theaters within 
the new Escondido civic complex. President Lou Fleming said his company offers 
"specialist expertise that isn't available in most architectural firms. In the 
final analysis, we would end up advising one of the other three (architects)." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, advice was solicited from Ian Albery, the managing director of 
London's Shaftesbury Theatre and past president of the Society of West End 
Theatre. Albery said he was asked because of "the work I've done in adapting 
existing large theaters." He worked on the rehabilitation of eight West End 
theaters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of those who will submit proposals, each of whom will be paid $20,000, 
would discuss the details of their proposals before the meeting.

The Kremlin today sent thousands of soldiers to enforce a state of emergency in 
parts of the southern Caucasus, where fierce battles raged between hundreds of 
well-armed Azerbaijanis and Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
At least 56 people have been killed and 156 injured in ethnic strife in the 
republic of Azerbaijan since Thursday, Interior Ministry spokesman Vladimir A. 
Yanchenkov said today. 
</P>
<P>
Yanchenkov said at a briefing that authorities had recorded 167 pogroms and 
cases of arson. Civilians, mostly Armenians, are said to have been murdered at 
random in ethnically motivated attacks that provoked the gun battles. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet TV reported today that more than 5,000 Soviet army soldiers and 6,000 
internal security troops had been dispatched as reinforcements to the disputed 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in the neighboring republic of 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Presidium proclaimed a state of 
emergency Monday night, empowering the government to use units of the Soviet 
army, navy and KGB to put down the ethnic unrest. It was not known how many 
troops were sent to the region since ethnic clashes began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't bring ourselves to pronounce it aloud, but what is happening now in 
Karabakh, in northern Azerbaijan, can be termed unambiguously a civil war," 
correspondent O. Shapovalov wrote in the youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.

MONTOYA BLAMES AIDES FOR EVENTS THAT LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AGAINST HIM

State Sen. Joseph Montoya, on trial on federal corruption charges, testified in 
his own behalf today that aides either intentionally or by mistake are at fault 
for his legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Whittier Democrat, obviously nervous, was the first witness in 
what his attorneys say is likely to be the last week of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by his attorney, Montoya began his testimony by blaming one 
of the eight incidents of alleged wrongdoing on a fired aide, Jerry Asher, now 
a Tulare high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Asher, testifying earlier as a prosecution witness, told the jury that a 
lobbyist, Norbert Dall, approached him in 1983 in a Capitol hallway and asked 
how much it would cost to get Montoya's vote on a bill. 
</P>
<P>
Asher testified that he brought the request to Montoya, who told him his vote 
would cost $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Asher said he told Dall that he should give Montoya $3,000, keeping $500 for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Asher said, he was fired by Montoya after the senator discovered he was 
accepting kitchen appliances as gifts from former state Republican Chairman 
Mike Montgomery to spy on Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya denied receiving money from Dall and said the first he learned about 
the $500 that Asher admitted he kept was just before his trial began late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya also blamed another episode on a former aide, Amiel Jaramillo, who was 
indicted along with Montoya and is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Hundt, a San Diego businesswoman testifying for the prosecution, had said 
Jaramillo told her about a 1988 bill that would make her mail-order contact 
lens business illegal. 
</P>
<P>
She had earlier told the jury that Jaramillo steered her to lobbyist David Kim, 
who demanded a $20,000 fee and said a $3,000 campaign contribution to Montoya 
would ensure the bill's delay. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya never received any money from Hundt but agreed to the delay at 
Jaramillo's urging because opposition was developing to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael Sands produced a letter Montoya said he wrote to the 
Senate Rules Committee requesting the delay because of "insufficient notice to 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Montoya testified, he delayed the whole contact-lens issue until a 
hearing when the Legislature was not in session because "it seemed to need that 
kind of attention." 
</P>
<P>
He said a hearing was never held because the bill's author, Sen. Dan 
McCorquodale (D-San Jose), "seemed to lose interest." A similar bill was 
introduced in 1989 by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
Montoya conceded that another aide, Steve English, prepared a staff analysis of 
Seymour's bill that noted there was no opposition, even though Hundt and her 
husband engineered a letter-writing campaign against the bill among thousands 
of their California customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there was a mistake on his (English's) part," Montoya testified. 
</P>
<P>
English and Kim have refused to testify as defense witnesses, claiming their 
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

MCMARTIN JURORS RETURN, STILL PUZZLED BY CONSPIRACY CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial returned to their 
deliberations today after a long weekend and immediately expressed puzzlement 
about one conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who had received a question from the 
panel before it retired Friday, called jurors into the courtroom and explained 
they could find either Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 
guilty of conspiracy and acquit the other. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not expand on the explanation, and minutes after the jurors left the 
courtroom they sent word again that they had a further question. 
</P>
<P>
They asked how such a result was possible if conspiracy with one or more people 
was required to find that a conspiracy exists. 
</P>
<P>
The judge called lawyers for a conference and said he would answer the question 
later today. He has said in the past that a conspiracy in this case could 
involve one or more unnamed conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pounders prepared for the taking of 65 eventual verdicts in the 
case. The judge discussed in detail with lawyers the logistics of the courtroom 
scene, which he said he expects to be "highly emotional." Pounders said it 
would probably take more than an hour to read the complicated verdicts and 
agreed to a defense request that he announce the decisions regarding Mrs. 
Buckey before he discloses the verdicts for her son.

HIGH COURT PUTS SAN DIEGO KILLER NEARER GAS CHAMBER

The U.S. Supreme Court moved San Diego murderer Robert Alton Harris a giant 
step closer to the gas chamber today by flatly rejecting a broad legal 
challenge to his death sentence. He would be the first person to die in 
California's gas chamber since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Harris will likely be executed sometime toward the end of March or early 
April," Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp said at a morning press conference in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"In this one, the end is in sight. This is a somber moment. There can be no joy 
in taking a human life. Nor can there be any justice in prolonging this case 
any longer," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices rejected Harris' appeal by a 7-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old convicted murderer of two San Diego teen-agers still has legal 
avenues open to him, including a recently filed appeal in the state Supreme 
Court. But his case has progressed much farther through the court system than 
any of the other 272 prisoners on California's Death Row. 
</P>

If Harris is executed, California will join 13 other states which have carried 
out a death sentence since 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated capital 
punishment. Thirty-six states have death penalty laws, and nationwide more than 
2,200 prisoners are on Death Rows. Only 120 persons have been put to death 
since 1976, and most of them have died in four Southern states: Texas, Florida, 
Louisiana and Georgia. The only states outside the South that have carried out 
executions since 1976 are Nevada (4), Utah (3) and Indiana (2). 
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the state Supreme Court upheld his sentence, Harris' chance of 
obtaining any more lengthy delays is getting slimmer. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys, Michael McCabe and Charles Sevilla of San Diego, issued a brief 
statement saying they are "disappointed by the ruling" and vowing to press the 
new appeal in the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, our petition for writ of habeas corpus now before the California 
Supreme Court, which addresses other issues relating to the legality of the 
death penalty in this case, will succeed," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla told The Times that he had not spoken to Harris this morning, but 
noted: "We know the obvious. The guy is not feeling very good about it." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody can imagine what it is like to live with a death 
sentence over your head for 11 years while living in the abominable conditions 
of San Quentin," Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is on Death Row for the July 5, 1978, murders of John Mayeski and 
Michael Baker. The boys had been sitting in Mayeski's car in a north San Diego 
parking lot, eating a Jack-In-The-Box lunch. Brandishing a gun, Harris forced 
the boys to drive to a fire road at Miramar Reservoir, where he shot them and 
stole their car for use in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Harris and his brother Daniel robbed a bank of $3,009, then 
returned to the house where they were staying. Police quickly arrived and 
arrested them. San Diego police officer Steve Baker was among the arresting 
officers. Only later did he learn that his son had been one of Harris' victims. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was convicted and sentenced to death in 1979. In 1981, the state court 
upheld his death sentence on a 4-2 vote. For most of the years since then, his 
case has been in the federal courts. Counting the appeal rejected today, 
Harris' case has been before the U.S. Supreme Court four times. 
</P>
<P>
Families of the victims welcomed today's Supreme Court decision, but are 
skeptical an execution will take place this spring. "After 11 years, I'm not 
bringing out the champagne yet," said Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, 68, John 
Mayeski's mother. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court action today upheld the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruling that rejected an array of contentions. The action came without 
comment, although Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall 
dissented, as they do in all death penalty affirmances. Harris' attorneys had 
claimed in the latest appeal Court that he suffered from a "mental disorder," 
that he was treated more harshly by the trial jury because his victims were 
white, and that his trial was tainted by inflammatory pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist had told the sentencing jury that Harris had a "sociopathic 
personality." This mental condition, his lawyers argued, demands a less severe 
punishment for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unconstitutional to allow a medically recognized mental disorder to 
serve as a reason to put someone to death," Sevilla told the high court in his 
appeal for Harris.

The bodies of 11 young Vietnamese women, brutally murdered at sea, washed 
ashore in southern Thailand, Thai police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies, some naked and others only in pants, were strung together with 
nylon rope. The rope, twisted round the necks of some of the women, suggested 
they were dragged behind a boat before being cut loose into the sea, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they were Vietnamese because we found Vietnamese currency," a police 
officer in Nakorn Si Thammarat province said. 
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to tell whether the women had been raped because the bodies 
had started to decompose, he said.

Pollution, overcrowding and other ills of urban life may leave the residents of 
Japan's capital unfazed, but it took just a few inches of snow today to delay 
tens of thousands on their appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The season's first snowfall forced a two-hour closure of Tokyo's international 
airport. Commuter and inner-city trains ran late. And 23 people got hurt in 
falls on slippery streets, the Kyodo News Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
All the breakdowns and confusion stemmed from a snowfall that left only three 
to five inches around the area that sometimes goes through winter with no snow.

A man apparently envious of a colleague's prosperity killed him with an iron 
bar, raped the man's wife, murdered her and her children and was then caught 
after returning to rob their home, Tass press agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the multiple crime occurred in the city of Volzhsky, 600 miles 
southeast of Moscow, when a 36-year-old worker at the local synthetic fibers 
plant visited a colleague at home. 
</P>
<P>
"After a brief talk, he hit him over the head with an iron bar," Tass said. 
"The victim's children, a 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, heard the 
noise and rushed into the room. The visitor killed them, too, and then began to 
pack goods." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two days, the man returned to the house to empty it of all the 
family's possessions. According to Tass, a neighbor grew suspicious and called 
the police.

FDA HALVES RECOMMENDED AZT DOSAGE FOR PATIENTS WITH AIDS

The Food and Drug Administration today cut in half the recommended dose of AZT 
in response to new research that shows lower levels of the AIDS-fighting drug 
work as well and are safer than the original dose. 
</P>
<P>
AZT is the only government-approved drug that directly attacks the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 AIDS-infected Americans take AZT, according to the drug's 
manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co. 
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the decision to 
reduce the recommended dose means "that fewer patients may have to discontinue 
AZT therapy because of serious side effects." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the potential reduction in the number and severity of side effects, 
the cost of AZT should be less. It now costs about $6,400 a year for the 
standard AZT dose of 12 capsules daily. 
</P>
<P>
The side effects, including severe anemia, have forced about half of all users 
to stop taking the drug. AZT is not a cure for the always fatal disease but is 
used to prolong life.

Maverick Soviet legislator Boris N. Yeltsin warned today that Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev must institute a multi-party system and other radical 
political and economic reforms or risk a fall from power. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, leader of radical reformists in the Communist nation, said the Soviet 
Union "now is crumbling under growing dissatisfaction of the people." 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot predict who will preside over the party's next convention this fall 
unless Gorbachev implements sweeping reforms of the constitution and party 
principles," he told a news conference at the Japan National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized Gorbachev for promoting perestroika, or restructuring, under 
outdated principles. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he called on the Communist Party to convene a central committee meeting 
to revise the constitution, which now stipulates the party's absolute hold on 
power, and to make comprehensive changes in party principles. 
</P>
<P>
"If these steps are taken before it is too late, the current very difficult 
situation can be improved," he said.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, unveiling a $51.3-billion state budget, today called for 
about $700 million in higher taxes and fees and proposed that New Yorkers forgo 
a promised income tax cut in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, a second-term Democrat considered a potential 1992 presidential 
contender, said New York needs the extra money to deal with budget deficits and 
to combat drug abuse and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
New York's tax revenue has been hurt by earlier tax cuts and an economic 
slowdown in the Northeast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under his spending plan, the overall budget would grow 9.3%. Included in his 
proposal for additional revenue was a call for an increase in the cigarette tax 
of 5 cents a pack to 38 cents.

The Supreme Court today blocked indefinitely the effect of a lower-court ruling 
that could have provided natural gas consumers with tens of millions of dollars 
in refunds. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, granting an emergency request by 21 energy companies, held in 
abeyance a decision by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that could have 
led to the refunds. 
</P>
<P>
They will act later on a formal appeal to be filed by the energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans-based appeals court last Sept. 16 invalidated a 4-year-old 
federal regulation that allowed gas producers to raise some prices. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exceeded 
its authority in 1986 when permitting producers of "old" gas to raise their 
prices and to stop selling to pipeline companies not willing to pay the higher 
prices.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES TO BUY 50 AIRCRAFT;

<P>
Singapore Airlines, propelled by recent alliances with American and European 
airlines, said today that it has placed orders and options for 50 aircraft from 
Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. worth $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The airline plans to buy 30 747-400 aircraft from Boeing and 20 MD-11s from 
McDonnell Douglas, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has secured a firm order for 15 aircraft and an option for 15, while 
McDonnell has orders for 5 aircraft and an option for 15 others, the airline 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the purchase including engines and spares is $8.6 billion, the 
airline said. The aircraft are scheduled to be delivered between 1994 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The order was the largest ever by Singapore Airlines, which recently reached 
agreements with Swissair and Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
The three airlines have a combined network covering 237 destinations in 64 
countries, Singapore Airlines officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Seattle-based Boeing did not answer phone calls asking for 
comment. Spokeswoman Barbara Anderson at St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines is evaluating engines to power the aircraft, the airline 
said in a statement without giving details. Three companies, for example, make 
engines for the 747-400, including Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce and General 
Electric. 
</P>
<P>
"Singapore Airlines should be able to fully finance the purchase, but it may 
take advantage of available financing . . . that can reduce the cost of 
acquisition," the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singapore Airlines plans to grow at an average rate of 8% a 
year in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said that by 1999 it will have a fleet of between 35 and 50 
B747-400s supplemented by the MD-11s, some Airbus A310-300s and possibly a 
fourth aircraft type to be introduced for regional operations. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Singapore Airlines concluded an agreement with Swissair to help 
the Asian company gain access to more European cities ahead of the formation of 
a single European Community market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Three months earlier it signed a pact with Delta providing for cooperation in 
marketing, including special through-fares and sharing of airport terminals and 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At a later stage the Delta deal will extend to other areas such as joint 
purchase of goods and services, training and engineering and maintenance.

The stock market pulled out of its recent slide with an afternoon rally today. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.30 points in the two previous 
sessions, rebounded 23.25 to 2,692.62. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 793 up, 709 down and 463 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 186.07 million shares, against 140.59 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 1.66 to 188.37. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said blue chips in particular benefited from "bargain hunting" after 
their recent decline and better-than-expected auto sales reports for early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Many other stocks, however, remained on the defensive amid recession fears and 
worries prompted by weakness in the Japanese stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 666.41 points, or 1.8%, to 36,850.36. 
On Friday, before a long holiday weekend in Japan, the Nikkei lost 656.36 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that result heightened concern that rising interest rates and 
persistent inflationary pressures might lead to a business slump in many or all 
of the industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
They also said traders were still trying to assess the financial fallout from 
Monday's long-expected filing for bankruptcy protection by Campeau Corp.'s 
Federated and Allied retailing operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading today, reflecting what economists called 
worries about inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 17/32 point, or about 
$5.30 per $1,000 in face value, by midday. The bond's yield, which rises when 
prices fall, increased to 8.24% from 8.17% on Friday. The government bond 
market was closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the U.S. credit market was responding partly to the Tokyo bond 
market, which experienced a sharp sell-off today amid fears about rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"With interest rates rising in Tokyo and elsewhere there are heightening 
inflation concerns worldwide," said Marshall B. Front, an economist at the 
Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in the U.S. market, we can't seem to find a level where 
investors will commit." 
</P>
<P>
Bond investors fear a rise in inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income 
securities such as bonds and notes. An acceleration of inflation could also 
prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit and encourage higher interest 
rates, further depressing bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up to 7.83% as the discount rose 11 
basis points to 7.59%. Yields on six-month bills had advanced to 7.91% as the 
discount rose 9 basis points to 7.52%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.86% 
as the discount added 9 basis points to 7.33%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 3/16%, up from 8 1/16% late Friday.

Campeau Corp.'s U.S. subsidiary today appointed G. William Miller, former 
Federal Reserve Board chairman and Treasury secretary, as its chairman and 
chief executive officer, one day after putting its department stores under 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 64, steps into a job created when Toronto-based Campeau last week split 
its U.S. operations from the parent company, giving them operating 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unit is the parent of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied 
Stores Corp., which own such department stores as Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, 
Abraham &amp; Strauss and Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
They were placed under protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy law on Monday, enabling the stores to continue operating 
while Campeau tries to work out its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 11 filing was the largest by a U.S. retailer, affecting about 
100,000 employees and 258 stores in the United States, and the second-largest 
by a non-financial company after Texaco Inc., which sought court protection in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's U.S. subsidiary also announced today that it will change its name 
from Campeau Corp. (U.S.) Inc. to Federated Stores Inc. and that John W. Burden 
III, chairman and chief executive officer of Federated and Allied, has quit 
effective Jan. 31 "to pursue other interests." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, chairman of G. William Miller &amp; Co., a Washington-based merchant 
banking firm, has served on the boards of Campeau, Federated and Allied since 
1987. He became Fed chairman in 1978. From 1979 to 1981, Miller was Treasury 
secretary under President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the moves announced today represent significant developments in the 
company's effort to reorganize under bankruptcy court supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is now positioned with a strong and experienced management team at

An environmental group today criticized industry reliance on three widely used 
ozone-destroying chemicals, saying that while some companies are cutting back 
on their use others are relying on them even more. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council produced industry figures showing more 
than 200 million pounds of the chemicals were released into the atmosphere by 
more than 3,000 companies in 1987, the last year for which complete figures 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
Partial figures for 1988 show continued heavy use of the chemicals with "the 
vast majority of companies . . . yet to take any concrete steps to phase them 
out," said David Doniger, a lawyer for the NRDC. "Their delays threaten the 
health and safety of all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the NRDC study are two chemicals widely used as metal-cleaning 
solvents -- methyl chloroform and CFC113 -- in the aerospace, computer and 
electronics industries. The third chemical is carbon tetrachloride, which is 
primarily used in the United States for manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs.

The head of the Guardian Angels and a fashion model whose face was slashed by 
thugs appeared in court today to protest what they view as hostile questioning 
of a doctor who contends she caught AIDS from a hypodermic needle at a city 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Model Marla Hansen, 28, whose widely publicized case provoked a national 
outpouring of sympathy, said defense questioning of Dr. Veronica Prego, 32, in 
the trial of her $175-million lawsuit "reminded me" of the intense and personal 
questioning she underwent during the trial of assailants, purportedly hired by 
her landlord, charged with attacking her in June, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Prego spent a fifth day on the witness stand today. Defense lawyer Stanley 
Friedman, conducting the cross-examination, continued to call into question her 
account of the night on which she claims she pricked her finger on an infected 
needle at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Sliwa, national director of the Guardian Angels and wife of the 
organization's founder, Curtis Sliwa, also went to court and pledged to support 
Prego. Sliwa criticized acquired immune deficiency syndrome activists, 
including the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, for not appearing on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"If these people were concerned with people who had AIDS instead of their own 
political agenda, they would be down here speaking out in support of this 
woman," Sliwa said.

CBS TO AIM AT YOUNGER VIEWERS

<P>
The newly appointed president of CBS Entertainment says the network must 
overhaul its antiquated prime-time lineup to rise out of last place in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sagansky, who joined CBS two weeks ago from his position as president of 
Tri-Star Pictures, said the schedule appeals to viewers "well over 45" years 
old and that the network "is programming too narrowly in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the network can be just a narrow casting vehicle," Sagansky said 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We do need more comedies," he said. "The question is which night do you open a 
comedy night on?" 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky confessed that CBS is in worse shape than NBC was 10 years ago, when 
that network was a distant third. Sagansky said one of the obstacles to CBS' 
comeback is that the television marketplace is more competitive than in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
One of the network's top priorities is re-establishing contacts with some of 
Hollywood's more dynamic producers, he said, adding that he would offer fresh 
talent the chance "to do the show that they've always wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky, whose record at Tri-Star included such flops as "Lock-up" and hits 
like "Steel Magnolias," said the network's struggling "Pat Sajak Show" would 
undergo several changes beginning in February but is in no immediate peril of 
cancellation.

Cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and his wife, opera singer Galina 
Vishnevskaya, have had their Soviet citizenship restored to them 12 years after 
the government took it away, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet legislature gave them back their citizenship and nullified the 
decree that had stripped them of their medals and honorary titles, the official 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostropovich, 62, gained international renown with the Moscow Philharmonic 
Orchestra, but in the early 1970s he incurred the Soviet government's disfavor 
by giving refuge to dissident author Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He left the Soviet 
Union with his family and was stripped of his citizenship in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He has since become a household name in the West. Queen Elizabeth II conferred 
a knighthood on him in 1987 on his 60th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Several other prominent Soviet cultural figures who lost their citizenship 
under past regimes have had it restored in recent months amid the cultural thaw 
that prevails under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn is a notable exception; Soviet officials say they have not 
received any application from him to have his citizenship restored.

ASK DR. RUTH: THERAPY ISN'T REQUIRED FOR ENJOYING A TERRIFIC SEX LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DR. RUTH WESTHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Question: I am very much in love with my husband, and every once in a while we 
have a wild time making love. I mean one that is thoroughly satisfying to me -- 
and if it doesn't "make the Earth move" then it certainly does something at 
least that big. I feel that all the great things I ever heard about sex have 
come true. But it is not regular, and I feel that I may not actually be able to 
climax every time. 
</P>
<P>
I think he has to learn how to romanticize or be more sensual, move at a 
slower, more tantalizing pace. Where do I get this sex counseling or therapy 
you talk about? How much does it cost? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Where and how much and what goes on in the therapist's office is 
information you can get from a local sexuality clinic or by phoning a sex 
therapist. You just have to prepare yourself to ask this professional the 
questions that people ask her or him all the time. Answering them sensibly is 
part of the therapist's job. 
</P>
<P>
The counseling or therapy ranges from free clinic sessions to what you arrange 
with the therapist. Some therapists charge a flat rate for the first 
exploratory session and then discuss fees for subsequent sessions. That is for 
private sessions, not clinic work. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to know is that what goes on in the therapist's office 
is all talk. Nothing sexual happens there. Every now and then I print this 
address for people who want information on sex therapists or names or telephone 
numbers in their area: Write to the American Assn. of Sex Educators, Counselors 
and Therapists, 11 Dupont Circle NW, Suite 220, Washington D.C. 20036 and ask 
for information or for a list of accredited psychosexual therapists near you. 
</P>
<P>
However, I am not sure you need to go to a sex therapist at all. If it would be 
convenient for you in all ways, it might be a first call for information, but I 
think you need more general information before even thinking of a therapist. 
For instance, you should know -- and you will get this from reading a reliable 
sex manual -- that in a normal sex life the orgasms, or climaxes, are not 
uniformly magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
Some are nice, some are negligible, some are great -- think of other gratifying 
experiences in life. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to improve your own sexual functioning, you have to know more about 
your own sexual responsiveness and you have to be responsible for it. It's not 
fair to expect your husband to know all that about you when you don't know it 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that the man must be the guide and teacher in great sexual sharing is 
much out of date. It had this good point -- it preached that men were 
responsible for playing a wooing and helpful part in pleasing their women and 
that good sex did not consist of reaching ejaculation as soon as possible.

LIZ SMITH: DREW BARRYMORE DETAILS HER LIFE -- ALL 14 YEARS

<P>
IS AGE 14 too young for one to be writing an autobiography? I suppose it isn't 
if you are Drew Barrymore, whose book "Little Girl Lost" is bound to become one 
of those hot reading experiences of the cautionary '90s. The beloved and 
appealing little girl from the movie "E. T." took her first drink at 9, smoked 
her first joint at 10 and began using cocaine at 12. The tabloids had a field 
day with this Barrymore, just as yellow journalism in the past had a field day 
with other illustrious members of her famous family. But Drew is surely the 
youngest star ever to burst on the show biz scene, then fall quickly from 
grace, then attempt suicide, then get her act together as a recovering addict. 
</P>
<P>
Pocket Books encouraged Drew to tell her story, and she does in a 
dishearteningly "adult" manner. This work could break your heart when it isn't 
filling you with hopeless rage. Drew will be telling all on Oprah Winfrey's TV 
show at the end of the month and says she has new perspectives to offer. Maybe 
Drew has some advice for parents on how not to have their kids going haywire 
before they are even in their teens. 
</P>
<P>
THE ENORMOUSLY successful game show "Wheel of Fortune" has been taping at 
Disney World in Florida, and the producers prove that they are a serious, 
no-nonsense bunch. Last Sunday, Michael Jackson and his entourage suddenly 
appeared on the set and asked to use the bathroom. (Michael was at Disney World 
for the opening of the George Lucas "Star Wars" tour.) But the megastar was 
told that the bathrooms were "for contestants only." Period. 
</P>
<P>
So the Jackson gang was obliged to move on. At "Wheel of Fortune" it seems they 
aren't impressed by Michael Jackson. After all, they have Vanna White. 
</P>
<P>
DOES ANYBODY around here remember when Eddie Gilbert was the junior grade "Ivan 
Boesky" of the '60s? Gilbert and his then wife, Rhoda, cut a wide social swath 
in cafe society (before it went nouvelle). He changed his name from Ginsberg to 
Gilbert and hired columnist Igor Cassini to promote him. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1967, Gilbert went to jail for two years after pleading guilty to 
embezzlement in matters concerning his hardwood flooring firm, E. L. Bruce 
&amp; Co. Then, in the early '80s, Gilbert was back in jail for stock 
manipulation. Now he is about to become a three-time loser. He will be 
sentenced March 8 in the federal court by Judge Charles Haight, a top-rated 
jurist of the Southern District of New York. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the person who blew the whistle was writer Ken Geist. Ken had been 
fascinated by the saga of Eddie Gilbert and wanted it to be a book. But at the 
same time he handed over his own inheritance to Gilbert, which the latter 
invested at a loss. The rules of Gilbert's probation restricted him from 
engaging in any financial dealing. Now Eddie Gilbert has to pay the price.

Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax, plagued by a degenerative hip 
condition, is retiring after eight years in the National Football League, a 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregonian said Lomax, 30, planned to make the announcement today in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax, a two-time Pro Bowl choice, missed the 1989 season because of an 
arthritic left hip but had been undergoing therapy with the hope he could make 
a comeback next season. 
</P>
<P>
The hip condition improved but not enough to allow him to return to the rigors 
of professional football, said Lomax, a native of the Portland suburb of Lake 
Oswego. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided in the last three or four months that I can't play and I don't want 
to be lying around praying for a miracle," Lomax said Monday afternoon as he 
prepared to fly to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't happen -- but that's not to say it won't," Lomax said. "But I'm done 
playing, and I want to get on with my life."

Boris Becker, in eager pursuit of a third straight Grand Slam title, is worried 
about peaking too soon in the Australian Open after flexing his muscles in a 
first-round showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Becker pummeled travel-weary Paul Haarhuis 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 today, just a few 
hours after the Dutchman arrived from New Zealand following visa difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis, who upset John McEnroe in the second round of the U.S. Open last 
fall, never had a chance against the Becker onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, said the McEnroe upset was on his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the reason why I played very hard in the first round, which is not normal 
for me," he said. "In a Grand Slam, you can't play too well too early. You have 
to wait a little bit. There's a fine line between not playing too good and 
playing too bad. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to do good in a Grand Slam, I have to peak the last three days. If 
you peak too early, then you might not be able to peak again." 
</P>
<P>
While Becker looked sharp, Stefan Edberg and McEnroe issued warnings that they 
might be ready to stop him as he goes after Ivan Lendl's Australian title and 
No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken but confident Edberg, 1985 and 1987 Australian Open champion, 
won his first-round match today and proclaimed himself ready to challenge No. 1 
Lendl and No. 2 Becker for the top spot in men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself there," said the No. 3 Edberg, whose highest ranking was No. 2 in 
1987. "I feel strongly that I can come back to challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg beat Swedish-born Johan Anderson, who lives in Australia, 7-6 (7-1), 
6-3, 6-4, in a first-round match on center court just before Becker took on 
Haarhuis. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe made his debut on center court earlier in the day and swept to an easy 
victory over Thierry Tulasne of France. (Story, C2.) 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches today, No. 5 Aaron Krickstein of Grosse Point, 
Mich., beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 7-5; No. 8 Mats 
Wilander of Sweden beat Australian Richard Fromberg 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 7-5 and No. 
9 Andres Gomez of Ecuador beat Australian Darren Cahill, a 1988 U.S. Open 
semifinalist, 4-6, 6-3, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Carl-Uwe Steeb, who beat fellow West German Becker last week in Sydney, 
lost to Veli Paloheimo of Finland 5-7, 6-2, 0-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>

No. 11 Andrei Chesnokov beat Australian Mark Kratzmann 3-6, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6

No. 12 Yannick Noah of France struggled past Yugoslav Goran Prpic 4-6, 7-6

6-3, 6-2, 6-4.

MCCANTS TO SKIP SENIOR SEASON, ENTER NFL DRAFT

<P>
Keith McCants, Alabama's All-America linebacker, said today that he will pass 
up his senior season to enter the NFL draft so he can provide financial 
security for himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be one of the top draft choices, possibly by the Atlanta 
Falcons, and he said he would be happy to play with them or any other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
McCants, Alabama's leading tackler during its 10-2 season, said at a news 
conference: "I truly believe that it is now time for me to move on. With the 
chance to play in the NFL, I have the opportunity to provide financial security 
for myself and my family." 
</P>
<P>
He said the recent resignation of Bill Curry as the Alabama coach to take the 
job at Kentucky had no bearing on his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing what's best for my family," McCants said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he began thinking seriously about the NFL after the Auburn game, 
Alabama's last of the regular season. He said he has not hired an agent but has 
some in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if would mind playing for Atlanta, he commented: "I would be more than 
happy to play anywhere in the NFL. There are more than 600,000 college football 
players in the country, and I feel fortunate to have a chance to be one of the 
top draft choices." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL said today that it had received no request from McCants concerning the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the draft, the NFL has required that players either have 
been in school five years, used up all their college eligibility through 
participation or have been graduated. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Paul Tagliabue, the new commissioner, will move 
to make it easier for underclassmen to get into the draft pool. 
</P>
<P>
"While the overall issue of NFL draft eligibility is being reviewed at this 
point, Commissioner Tagliabue is expected to present his new proposals to the 
NFL clubs at or before the league meetings in March," Joe Browne, the NFL's 
director of communications, said. "At this point I would be speculating on how 
these rules might change." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5, 255-pound McCants is expected to be among the top picks in the 
April draft, and it has been reported that he will be the first player chosen 
by the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he denied reports that he does not want to play in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in the South, I love the South, I've lived here 21 years," he said. 
"I've never been anywhere else, I think I can get along well anywhere I go." 
</P>
<P>
Scouts have touted McCants as the best defensive player to come out of college 
football in years because of his combination of size, strength, speed (4.4 
seconds in the 40-yard dash), and attitude.

"I described him as a St. Bernard puppy, the way he played with so much 
enthusiasm and great intensity," said Curry. "Those were even finer assets than 
his physical ability, which is enormous.

"Keith's looking at several million dollars, and it's hard to pass that up. 
He's got greatness written all over him."

McCants, a native of Mobile, garnered the attention of pro scouts even though 
he played only two seasons at Alabama. He missed his freshman year when he

McCants said he plans to return to Alabama in the off-season to continue 
working toward a degree in criminal justice.

DISTANCE AND TIMING PLAY ROLES IN DECLINE OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT CALABRIA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian Open is played in a futuristic stadium on a Space Age surface, 
but the allure of the event is a relic, like grass. 
</P>
<P>
That's too bad. The Australian has been the scene of many memorable matches -- 
Rod Laver's 7-5, 22-20, 9-11, 1-6, 6-3 victory over Tony Roche in the 1969 
semifinals comes to mind, and the legacy of Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe 
and all the other great Aussies is worth upholding. But look at the number of 
absentees from Melbourne this week. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova, Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez are skipping the event. 
So are Andre Agassi and Brad Gilbert. Michael Chang wasn't planning to go, even 
before he got hurt. The Australian, because of its faraway location and awkward 
place on the tennis calendar, no longer is the attraction that it used to be 
for many players. 
</P>
<P>
Even John McEnroe, who is there, said, "It's silly. You're playing in, like, 
your first tournament of the year, and already it's a Grand Slam." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is hardly new. Top draws such as Chris Evert often passed up the 
Australian, especially after 1977 when the tournament was moved from January as 
the first Grand Slam event on the schedule to December as the last. Back then, 
Evert and others cited a desire to stay home around Christmas after a long year 
on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
The return to a January date in 1987 appeared to rekindle much of the interest 
among players, but their enthusiasm is fading again. Also, the tournament has 
suffered other blows recently, despite the move last year to the $42-million, 
ultra-modern National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
First, the soaring popularity of tennis in Europe has closed the gap in 
importance between the French Open and the other two Grand Slams -- Wimbledon 
and the U.S. Open -- leaving the Australian a distant last. And with more 
players specializing in surfaces, fewer than ever are willing to go to 
Melbourne to play on the new Rebound Ace, a rubberized hard court unlike any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe has suggested moving the Australian closer to the middle of the 
calendar. And the proposal has some merit. 
</P>
<P>
If the Australian were played in March, more toward the heart of the season, 
the tournament would seem like less of a second cousin to the other Grand 
Slams. In addition, the temperatures in Australia in March are milder than in 
January, when the continent is at the peak of summer and heat is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the big obstacle to such a shift is that the Australian has already 
bounced around twice on the schedule, and officials are reluctant to tamper too 
much with tradition. And the timing of the event coincides with Australia Day, 
the national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"All the same," McEnroe said, "it's something we should think about." 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open is kicking off a new year in tennis, but it's not just 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
The women's circuit has a new umbrella sponsor and, with that, a new name -- 
the Kraft-General Foods World Tour. But former sponsor Virginia Slims will 
continue its 19-year association with women's tennis by promoting 13 U.S. 
events on the tour, including the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing changes are equaled by the turbulent times on court. Of the top 
20 players, 12 had their best career rankings last year, led by Gabriela 
Sabatini (3), Zina Garrison (4), Sanchez (5), Seles (6) and Conchita Martinez 
(7). 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the net were Pam Shriver, who sank from No. 5 to 17; 
Natalia Zvereva, who dropped from No. 7 to 27, and Barbara Potter, who, because 
of a back injury, plunged from No. 10 to 105. 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva may be on the way back, however. She won both Australian Open tuneups 
in Brisbane and Sydney the last two weeks for her first career tournament 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic change of all for 1990 has taken place on the men's tour. 
After much ballyhoo, the Assn. of Tennis Professionals has taken over operation 
of the circuit from the defunct Men's Tennis Council, so the old Grand Prix 
tour is now the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
While the ATP Tour, run by the players and their representatives, is starting 
to overhaul the way men's tennis conducts its business -- changing rules, 
moving tournament sites, improving the ranking system -- McEnroe pleaded for a 
little patience from the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's not going to be great right away," he said. "Don't judge us on 
the first year."

Colin Hegarty has resigned as president of Oregon Racing Inc., the company that 
operates troubled Portland Meadows horse race track. 
</P>
<P>
Hegarty, whose tenure was marred by a bitter dispute with the association that 
provides the track's horses, quit on Sunday, said Don Johnson, a vice president 
of Oregon Racing Inc. Johnson will succeed Hegarty. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Hegarty's departure did not signal a change in the company's 
attitude about the operation of the track. Company officials have said that the 
track cannot survive financially without off-track betting at several sites in 
the Portland area. 
</P>
<P>
But the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, which provides the 
horses for the track, has been vehemently opposed to off-track betting, saying 
it will cut down on the live gate at the track and, consequently, reduce the 
horse owners' share of the earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things on the agenda will be to see if we can't find some 
common ground to stand on with the horsemen so that the entire industry can 
move forward," Johnson said.

<P>
GOLD SERIES FINAL HAS FIELD OF 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Monterey Farms's Flight Strip could post his third straight victory when he 
tackles a field of seven in the $20,000 California Gold Series Final tonight at 
Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Series Final was originally scheduled to be raced on Jan. 10, but that 
event was rescheduled due to fog which forced the cancellation of that night's 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Flight Strip will be one of the favorites tonight with close competition 
expected from Clos Du Val and Red Star Baron. 
</P>
<P>
In post position order, the field for tonight's main event is as follows: Clos 
Du Val, Jim Grundy in the race bike; Flight Strip , Gene Vallandingham; Red 
Star Baron, Ross Croghan; Black N Spicy, Peter Wrenn; Absolute Gem, Jim Lackey; 
El Dante, Steve Desomer; Rigor of Rock, Jim Butler; and Muscat Canelli, Robert 
Sleeth. 
</P>
<P>
Flight Strip has beaten Red Star Baron and all the other entrants in tonight's 
field in divisions of the second and third legs of this series. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Series Final is the eighth race on tonight's program.

POETRY READINGS TAILORED TO THE UNSTUFFY;

<P>
VERSE: POETS READING INC. HOSTS A POPULAR SERIES OF POETRY AND PROSE READINGS. 
GROUP'S CO-FOUNDER SAYS TODAY'S POETRY IS VERY ACCESSIBLE. 
</P>

<P>
Even in the enlightened '90s, for many of us the mention of poetry readings 
summons mental images of stiff-backed chairs and starchy verse, or the 
bongo-beating beatniks of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Michael Logue, co-founder of Poets Reading Inc. The nonprofit 
group, which hosts a popular series of poetry and prose readings at the 
Fullerton Museum Center, will add a second program beginning tonight at 
Tustin's LP Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the esoteric poets still rely on the illusions of the ancients," said 
Logue, "and that can be over the general person's head. But poetry is changing. 
Much of today's poetry uses today's symbolism, today's language . . . which 
makes it very accessible to anybody who doesn't have a steady diet of 'Three's 
Company.' " 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Live Anthology," tonight's program will feature 11 Southern California 
writers and musicians who were featured last year at the Fullerton series. Each 
writer will read for about 10 minutes, then move to an offstage area to meet 
with audience members. 
</P>
<P>
"As a society, I think we lost a tremendous treasure when we lost touch with 
personal communications," Logue said. "Through the readings, we're trying to 
bring back the oral tradition as it existed before the advent of TV and film. 
In a way, we're reviving a really basal form of communication." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's panel will include Los Angeles writer-musician Linda Albertano, 
Willie Simms of San Fernando, Fountain Valley musician Joel Easton, Laguna's 
Gene Galluna, Kathi Georges of Costa Mesa and Lee Mallory of Huntington Beach. 
Also on the program are Thomas Rush, an Anaheim truck driver who spends his 
time on the road composing what Logue describes as "very dark and deep free 
verse," and Costa Mesa's Monica Lamy, whose works sometimes recall her 
childhood in the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody may like every writer," Logue said, "so we try to program 
contrasting but complementary artists. We try to offer something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"A poetry reading is a personal, one-on-one kind of experience. Each person in 
the audience forms a different picture from the words being spoken. It stirs 
the creative juices." 
</P>
<P>
Poets Reading Inc. was launched in the winter of 1988 when Logue, a musician 
and writer, and Tina Rinaldi, an art history student at Cal State Fullerton, 
began to hold informal readings at a Fullerton bookstore. The series moved to 
the Fullerton Museum Center that summer, where it has continued on alternate 
Saturday evenings and has been drawing about 80 people at each program, Logue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The programs generally include presentations by two featured writers, followed 
by an hour of open readings, with a half-hour break between to allow the 
artists and audience to mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Local notables have included Robert Peters of Huntington Beach, a UC Irvine 
instructor known for his epic poems based on such colorful figures as King 
Ludwig of Bavaria and the Countess of Bathory, a bloodthirsty noblewoman of the 
16th Century. Out-of-state guests have included New York writer Lyn Lifshin, 
who will return in March. 
</P>
<P>
With an established following in the North County, Logue and Rinaldi decided to 
reach farther south and worked out an agreement with the 150-seat LPR Dinner 
Theatre (also known as the Brobdingnag Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
By booking such well-known writers as Ray Bradbury and Indian poet Joy Harjo, 
along with local writers, Logue hopes to attract a broader audience to the LPR 
series. (Bradbury is scheduled to appear in October; Harjo in June.) 
</P>
<P>
To cover administrative costs and to fund an ambitious scholarship program for 
area creative writing students, Logue and Rinaldi are seeking grants from area 
foundations and corporations. Funds also come from a modest subscription 
program: for $15 a year, audience members receive a ticket discount and a 
quarterly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, poetry readings have been kind of a hit-or-miss thing in Orange 
County," Logue said. "Through grant writing and other income-producing efforts, 
we're working to produce a stable organization." 
</P>
<P>
Poets Reading Inc. presents "Live Anthology," an evening of poetry, prose and 
music, tonight at 8 p.m. at the LP Repertory Theatre, 15732 Tustin Village Way, 
Tustin. Tickets: $5 to $7. For information, call (714) 441-1820.

The anticipated cable television premiere of "Secret Passions," a gay-oriented 
soap opera under production in Orange County, has been postponed from Jan. 23 
to Feb. 1, the show's producer said Monday. The postponement will be to 
accommodate plans for a kickoff press party for the show, which is being aimed 
at leased-access cable channels, producer David Gadberry said. A pilot has been 
completed, but no more episodes are finished, and as of Monday afternoon 
Gadberry said he had not sent the pilot to any cable stations and could not 
confirm that any channels will air it on his targeted launch date.

A SPARE 'TWELFTH NIGHT' TO BE STAGED AT GEM THEATRE; 
</P>
<P>
DRAMA: SEASON'S MOST POPULAR AND MALLEABLE SHAKESPEARE WORK WILL BE MADE TO FIT 
ON GEM'S SMALL STAGE. ARTISTIC DIRECTOR THOMAS F. BRADAC SAID THE AUDIENCE WILL 
MAINLY BE ON ITS OWN. 
</P>

The big news on the Southern California theater scene at the moment is the 
arrival of Kenneth Branagh and his Renaissance Theatre Company at the Mark 
Taper Forum in Los Angeles, where the British troupe is making its U.S. debut 
with "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, can anybody doubt that the most popular Shakespeare play of the 
season across the country is "Twelfth Night: Or, What You Will"? The magazine 
American Theatre conservatively estimates that at least half a dozen U.S. 
troupes have it on their schedules between now and June. 
</P>
<P>
"It's spreading like Dutch elm disease," Todd London, the magazine's managing 
editor, said on the phone from New York last week. And he was not even counting 
major productions of the play this fall at the Shakespeare Theatre at the 
Folger in Washington and last summer at the New York Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The American Repertory Theatre currently is doing "Twelfth Night" in Cambridge, 
Mass. On Wednesday alone, two more productions will take the stage -- one at 
the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco and the other, much closer 
to home, at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Shakespeare's 1601 comedy about a pair of shipwrecked twins and two 
pairs of confused lovers so popular? Among other things, probably its setting 
in the mythical land of Illyria. 
</P>
<P>
As one scholar has put it, "Illyria is a world of deceptive surfaces, where 
appearances constantly fluctuate between what is real and what is illusory." 
Such ambiguities not only sound like a reflection of contemporary society, they 
also allow free-wheeling directors more room than usual for interpretation. And 
so "Twelfth Night" productions can be particularly imaginative -- some might 
say wildly outlandish -- with no two necessarily alike. 
</P>
<P>
At American Rep, for instance, director Andrei Serban has staged his production 
in a style described by one theater staffer as "indescribable." Pressed to try, 
she spoke of a heady mix of Mediterranean costumes, props and scenic designs 
ranging from ancient Greece to modern Rome. 
</P>
<P>
At ACT, on the other hand, director Jack Fletcher is said to be mounting an 
exotic version that summons up the palm trees of the tropics, turbans and 
sarongs of the Far East, and other design elements echoing everything from 
"Miami Vice" to a fabulous spa. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over at the Gem, "Twelfth Night" will be downloaded. It is about to 
get what Thomas F. Bradac dryly called in a recent interview the "non-concept 
concept" treatment. Bradac, the artistic director of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, has devised a spare, backstage-style production meant "to emphasize 
the text and not get caught up in the conceit of time and place." 
</P>
<P>
Although his staging "will assist the audience with simple sets that have 
lighting as the major design feature," he said that playgoers will have to rely 
"more on their own imaginations" to appreciate Shakespeare's sense of theater. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the characters themselves are strikingly contemporary, Bradac noted. 
Virtually all of them are caught up in an identity crisis of some kind or 
other. "I think of this play as a comedy of identity," he said. He is not 
alone. Even the characters agree. 
</P>
<P>
As Orsino, Duke of Illyria, remarks in amazement upon seeing the previously 
disguised Viola together with her male twin, Sebastian: "One face, one voice, 
one habit, and two persons / A natural perspective, that is and is not." 
</P>
<P>
(Curiously, the same might be said of Vladimir and Estragon, existential twins 
of another order, in Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" -- which opens Friday 
at the Alternative Repertory in Santa Ana.) 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the high and low comedy that "Twelfth Night" provides, it affords 
the audience a chance to meet Malvolio, one of the most frequently discussed 
characters in the Shakespeare literature and "something of an enigma," Bradac 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very cryptic," the director noted. "He seems very negative, a nasty sort 
of man who lands in the loony bin. He has always been perceived both as an 
anomaly and as the best thing in the play. It's no accident that when Olivier 
did 'Twelfth Night,' he did Malvolio." 
</P>
<P>
For all Bradac's inclination to spareness, he still has re-shaped the play. The 
order of the first two scenes has been reversed, for instance, so as to infuse 
the production with Bradac's own sense of dramatic line. "It's cleaner for me 
that way," he said. "We begin in a storm, and we go from darkness to light." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, other directors have reversed those scenes before. Alec Guinness did 
it for a London production at the Old Vic back in 1948, according to critic 
Eric Bentley, even tacking on his own storm at the end of the play to achieve 
an elaborate (and, to Bentley's mind, unsatisfactory) symbolic symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradac's re-shaping has been determined, above all, by the need to fit his 
production within the small space of the Gem's stage. Unlike the outdoor 
Festival Amphitheatre, which has a huge stage, the Gem can't handle a 
large-scale Shakespearean affair. Consequently, except for Benjamin Stewart's 
one-man staging of the Bard's epic poem "The Rape of Lucrece" in 1988, no 
Shakespeare has been offered at the Gem since "The Taming of the Shrew" in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like putting a size-12 foot in a size-10 shoe," Bradac said. "So my 
impulse was to take 'Twelfth Night' down to the basics, to investigate it 
without either the burden or the assistance of what might be called a 
'high-concept' treatment." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, by going against the expected norm of the far-fetched and 
scrutinizing the play "essentially as theatrical story-telling," he added, "I 
think we'll get closer to what Shakespeare wrote in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Preview performances of "Twelfth Night" begin Wednesday at the Gem Theatre, 
12852 Main St., Garden Grove, where the production will open Friday and 
continue through Feb. 17. Curtain times: Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m.; two Sundays (Jan. 21 and Feb. 11) at 3 p.m.; and two Saturdays (Jan. 27 
and Feb. 3) at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $16 to $20 (previews $10). Information: (714)
