It's beginning to look a lot like . . . Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Twinkle lights will henceforth glow year-round in Westwood Village, and the old 
lamplighter is Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky himself. 
</P>
<P>
The lights, until now entwined seasonally throughout the village's trees and 
bushes, will be permanently on display -- except for June, when they get 
disentangled to accommodate tree trimming. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky promises the illuminations will "add a special touch," and enhance 
what he, with rather foot-in-mouth word choice, termed Westwood Village's 
"pedestrian ambiance." 
</P>
<P>
He wuz robbed, he sez. 
</P>
<P>
A second helping of Zev: 
</P>
<P>
A few days after less-than-celebrity candidate Joe Shea filed papers to run for 
mayor of Los Angeles, and let the press know that his platform calls for 4,000 
new police officers. Councilman Yaroslavsky, who is no longer running for 
mayor, has proposed adding 2,100 officers to the force, with the money coming 
from the same source -- the Community Redevelopment Agency -- that Shay 
declares that he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence, says the disgruntled Shay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of candidates treat ideas like water -- it's everybody's 
property. That's not the case . . . it was my idea . . . we need thousands of 
new policemen. It's simply unfair of (Yaroslavsky) to appropriate this idea and 
make political hay out of it when just weeks ago his own platform never 
mentioned it." 
</P>
<P>
As George Bush never said: "Read . . . my . . . mind." 
</P>
<P>
Alan B. Ungar will swap you, even-steven, 30-30. 
</P>
<P>
On the third Thursday of every month, the Woodland Hills certified financial 
planner offers 30 minutes of financial advice to people facing layoff, divorce, 
illness or just rotten luck -- in exchange for a fee of "thirtysomething," 
meaning thirty-anything. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Ungar has collected donations of 30 apples, 30 rolls of toilet paper 
and 30 minutes of free hypnotherapy -- but not 30 pieces of silver. 
</P>
<P>
Any cash Ungar collects during the sessions is handed over to the anti-war 
group Beyond War, and the in-kind 30s, from fruit to lav paper, is sent to a 
shelter for battered women and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
And that, as we say in the newspaper biz, is 30 for that story. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure it.

Wednesday was the 66th annual meeting of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, a group of good-health professionals getting together in the land

trencherman Tommy Lasorda.

AL MARTINEZ: TAKING CARE OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Police Department is under fire these days as the result of a 
videotaped incident in which an officer cursed at and appeared to shove a man's 
face through a plate glass window for being black, wearing dirty clothes and 
occupying a 12-year-old car. The matter is under investigation by everyone but 
the Presbyterian Church and I'm certain that eventually we will learn that the 
officer violated basic police procedure. You never curse a suspect while 
shoving his face into a plate glass window. 
</P>
<P>
We all know by now that the victim of the face-shoving incident was Don 
Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from another police department who 
was trying to show that police abuse of minorities is rampant in Long Beach, a 
premise he managed to illustrate with some degree of personal sacrifice. I 
mean, plate glass windows aren't exactly plastic wrap. You've got to use a 
little muscle to shove a head through one. 
</P>
<P>
With Jackson that night was Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, 
who was driving the car. Both men wore dirty clothes, which in itself is 
considered a misdemeanor in Long Beach. They were tooling along Pacific Coast 
Highway at a moderate rate of speed when they were pulled over by a patrol car 
containing Officers Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
The entire incident was secretly videotaped by an NBC television crew as part 
of an activist group's sting operation looking for examples of police 
brutality. The officers insisted later that they had stopped the car not 
because the men were black and wore dirty clothes but because the car was 
straddling lanes, a claim the television camera proved to be questionable, at 
best. What happened thereafter was the cursing and the face-shoving by Officer 
Dickey, which was subsequentely aired nationwide by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
This has created an outcry by bleeding hearts who feel the incident 
demonstrates the basest kind of police racism, but I buy the theory promulgated 
by Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, that at worst his client is guilty of 
discourtesy for cursing Jackson, an offense that deserves nothing more serious 
than a good finger-shaking and a stern naughty. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney and others argue that Jackson set the whole thing up, deliberately 
goading Dickey into taking the action he took. In the first place, they say, 
Jackson suspiciously got out of his car when it was stopped (in cop idiom he 
exited the vehicle), then demanded to know why the officer had stopped him in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't realized until now that either getting out of a car or asking why you 
were stopped constituted acts of aggression requiring a response just short of 
deadly force. I was pulled over recently by a California Highway Patrol officer 
who claimed I was straddling lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway. When he stopped 
me, I exited my vehicle instantly because I've been told you have to move fast 
in order to talk a cop out of a ticket. Once he begins writing the citation 
it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for me, I'm not black, I don't drive an old car and I dress in a 
manner which, while not fashionable, isn't considered shabby. I even made the 
mistake of asking the patrolman why he had stopped me which, in Long Beach, 
gets your face shoved into a plate glass window. Fortunately, this was on a 
freeway and he would have had to drive me to the Santa Monica Mall in order to 
reach the nearest plate glass window. As it turned out, he let me go with a 
warning not to straddle lanes and never again to wear a polka-dot tie with a 
plaid jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dickey should, of course, be reprimanded for his abusive language and 
the Long Beach police manual ought to be revised to disallow shoving anyone's 
face into a plate glass window for simple traffic violations, except in cases 
where the suspect exits the vehicle and asks why he is being stopped, searched 
and cursed. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us can do our part when in Long Beach by not being black if 
possible and, if not possible, by being neat and not sassing the officers and, 
above all, not exiting your vehicle unless dragged out by the throat. A lot of 
plate glass windows will be saved that way. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, I hope the incident points up the tensions that exist between 
minority groups and police and in the end creates a means by which the tensions 
can be eased. Then we can get on to the serious business of a television series 
based on a white cop from one department who abuses a black cop from another 
department and in the end they turn out to be best friends who spend their 
lives fighting crimes committed by Mexicans, ole.

MY BEAT : COLOR HIS SUPER BOWL EMPTY, HIS FACE BLUSH-RED

The vacant parking place should have tipped me off. 
</P>
<P>
After all, I'd always heard there were was no such thing in San Francisco. But 
my flight had been delayed and I was late for my assignment, so I gratefully 
pulled into the spot in my rental car. 
</P>
<P>
It was seven years ago this week, and I was in the Bay City to write a colorful 
piece on the wacky inhabitants of a typical sports bar glorying in the 49ers' 
first Super Bowl. Then, as this Sunday, Cincinnati was the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing nothing of the city, I had phoned the San Francisco Examiner beforehand 
and the sports department had cheerfully recommended the name of a "great 
joint." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the available parking, I walked in expecting to see Super Bowl banners 
and noise-makers, giant television screens and wall-to-wall enthusiasts 
uttering quotable things and performing crazy stunts. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as I stumbled into the darkened interior, I was able to make out the 
shapes of six motionless, somewhat disheveled figures huddled over the bar, 
including one man who was crying as the National Anthem played on an aged 
television set. His friend assured the bartender, "Oh, don't mind him. He cried 
all the way through the Jerry Lewis telethon." 
</P>
<P>
I was taken aback but, with my uncanny affinity for getting people to open up, 
I decided to get a quote out of the bartender. "So . . . the Super Bowl," I 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He glared at me and my blue sports coat. "You want a drink?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered a beer. He brought me a can, sans glass. 
</P>
<P>
The game began and I waited, hoping that for some unaccountable reason a horde 
of Super Bowl enthusiasts would suddenly storm through the door. Instead, 
another of my seatmates fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
I was 35 years old, a veteran of 14 years in the business and I'd been 
hoodwinked by a rival newspaper, tricked into watching the Super Bowl at a Skid 
Row bar. That no one would care if I also began weeping was of small 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
I was unwittingly continuing a mostly vanished tradition dating back to the 
days when every big city was inhabited by several newspapers, which put out new 
editions every few hours and employed reporters under orders to use any trick 
to one-up a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
I'd heard of some of the ploys myself. 
</P>
<P>
There was the young newsman on the old Los Angeles Herald in the 1930s who had 
arranged with a supposed friend at the rival Express to see the Express' paper 
as it came off the press. The Herald man planned to phone the headlines back to 
his boss. Only an Express photographer suddenly appeared. A photo of the Herald 
reporter ran on the front page of the Express the next day alongside the 
headline: "How the Herald Gets Its News." 
</P>
<P>
There was the Examiner reporter in the 1950s who outraced The Times' 
representative to a farmhouse -- and the only telephone for miles -- with a 
story on a widely publicized murder case. The Examiner man called in his piece, 
then paid $50 to the owner of the farmhouse for the privilege of ripping the 
phone out of the wall. Stepping outside, where The Times man was politely 
waiting, the Examiner man smiled and said, "Here's the phone," and handed it 
over. 
</P>
<P>
And in the 1960s, there was the reporter on a small daily who made a habit of 
perusing the unoccupied desks of his rivals in a downtown bureau, occasionally 
copying down stories they had written -- until the day he stole one about a new 
meat plant in his hometown. Unknown to him, his colleagues had concocted the 
story and christened the fictitious plant, as well as the plant's officials, 
with names that translated as "horse" in various foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I could add myself to the list -- the Skid Row humor man, victimized by my 
own lazy research. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't sure The Times' sports editor had an appreciation of such journalistic 
traditions. So, at the end of the first quarter, I bid adieu to the bartender 
(who didn't look up). For the next hour, I slogged through innumerable 
construction and cable car zones before spotting a lively fern bar with a Super 
Bowl sign in front. 
</P>
<P>
This time, of course, there was no vacant parking place in sight. 
</P>
<P>
My eventual article, such as it was, gave the appearance that the enthusiasts 
in the bar had been strangely tight-mouthed until the second half, when they 
suddenly burst forth with boisterous comments. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, San Francisco and Cincinnati have a Super Bowl rematch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously the possessor of a good memory, the sports editor is giving me the 
day off. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I know that when the National Anthem starts, I'll feel a slight chill.

BRITISH ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having fought and won, with ever increasing majorities, 10 parliamentary 
elections in Britain, may I intrude into the debate in your letters column 
between Matthew Shugart (Jan. 1) and Tony Oakes (Jan. 9)? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Oakes is evidently a supporter of the fragmented Social Liberal Democrat 
alliance that the British electorate has rejected every time it has had the 
opportunity to do so. Your readers should not take too seriously his moans 
about "pendulum politics" and the "divide between north and south." Britain, 
like America, has its problems but the vast majority of British people, in all 
parts of the island, today earn more, keep more, and invest more than at any 
time in their history; while their government, especially the prime minister, 
enjoys more international respect than at any time since the Second World War. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Shugart makes more sense than Mr. Oakes. He recognizes that under 
proportional representation a candidate's chance of getting elected depends 
hardly at all on his or her appeal to his constituents but largely on how high 
up his name appears on a "list," drawn up by his party, usually behind closed 
doors. And the result, as I can testify from having seen proportional 
representation at work in parliaments all over Europe, is that minorities all 
too often impose their wishes on the majority -- damaging, not strengthening, 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For years, I served as a member of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. 
Weekends, I had to fly back to England to attend to my constituency duties. Not 
so the members from proportional representation countries. They took their ease 
in Strasbourg because proportional representation made them far less dependent 
on keeping the folks back home happy about what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
The other advantage of "first past the post" voting is that it helps to elect 
strong governments. A clear swing among the voters is translated into an even 
stronger swing in the legislature, so that the party winning power, more often 
than not, can get its legislation passed. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill, as always got it right. "Ours" he said, "is the worst system 
of election there is -- except for all the others."

OIL GLUT AND OIL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times staff writer Donald Woutat's recent articles on the current world oil 
glut and the future oil crisis were excellent (Part I, Dec. 25-27). They 
accurately describe the turmoil in the oil and gas industry as well as the 
problems that consumers will face in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The major integrated companies are taking advantage of low crude oil prices to 
maximize their downstream refining and marketing profits. Although average oil 
prices in 1988 were lower than they were in 1986 following the collapse of 
world oil prices, average gasoline prices were higher. This helps explain the 
record profits being posted by the larger companies! 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, the thousands of independent producers who produce one-third 
of the United State's domestic oil and gas are struggling to survive. This is 
especially critical in California where a typical heavy oil crude sells for 
only $9 per barrel, below the average $9.50 per barrel it takes to produce it! 
</P>
<P>
The severe depression in oil patch foretells of continued steep declines in 
U.S. production, increased imports from unstable areas of the world, and the 
future world oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry, the state and federal governments, and energy-thirsty 
consumers need to take a critical look at where we are headed. Cyclical low and 
high energy prices will continue to send shock waves through our economy until 
a responsible long-range national energy policy is adopted. From our 
perspective, what is needed most are more stabilized oil prices that will 
restore the balance of profit centers for the entire oil and gas industry. The 
consumer should not be affected since as the end user he determines the true 
fair market price.

OUTRAGE IN STOCKTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appalling crime that transformed a Stockton elementary-school playground 
into a slaughterhouse on Tuesday evokes horror at its purposelessness, grief 
for its young victims, outrage over how easily a killer came by the weapon that 
he would use to murder five children and wound 30 others. Last Aug. 3 Patrick 
Edward Purdy, who had a criminal record, walked into an Oregon gun shop, signed 
a paper saying that he was neither a felon nor "mentally defective," handed 
over some money and became the owner of a Chinese-made AK-47 semi-automatic 
rifle -- a weapon whose sole purpose is to kill people. Thus armed, Purdy was 
ready when prompted by God knows what compulsion to carry out his massacre of 
the innocents. 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be said too forcefully or too often, for it is a terrible truth: 
The crime that Purdy committed before ending his own life began the day he 
legally purchased the AK-47. The unindictable accomplices to that crime are all 
those who have resisted and sabotaged every effort to impose even the most 
minimum restraints on gun ownership. The National Rifle Assn. is the leading 
lobbying force opposing controls over virtually any kind of gun -- even those, 
like the AK-47, that no decent sportsman would think of using. The NRA doesn't 
write the nation's laws. It does, however, work long and hard and successfully 
to intimidate the nation's lawmakers. On no other issue of public concern have 
politicians at both the state and the federal levels proved more gutless, more 
weaselly, more ready to do the bidding of a coercive pressure group than on gun 
control.

Purdy entered the grounds of Cleveland Elementary School armed with 190 rounds 
of ammunition for his high-powered rifle. He could just as easily have been 
carrying 1,000 rounds, and his victims could just as easily have numbered in 
the hundreds. Will this latest tragedy at long last be enough to arouse 
Congress from its fearful inertia and, against the earlier expressed opposition 
of President-elect George Bush, lead it to ban such high-tech weapons and pass 
a law requiring a police check on all would-be gun purchasers so that felons, 
drug abusers and the mentally ill can be screened out? In Stockton, five died. 
How many more must die before responsibility and sanity finally prevail in 
Congress?

INCIDENT OR PATTERN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the altercation last Saturday night between two black activists and two 
white Long Beach police officers had run true to form, it would have attracted 
little attention and would have produced what the experts call a "swearing 
match." The cops, under oath, would have sworn that they pulled over the 
activists' car because it was weaving down Pacific Coast Highway and that one 
of the men threatened them and, while they were restraining him, smashed the 
plate-glass window of a hardware store with his elbow. The activists would have 
sworn that they had broken no traffic law and that, once pulled over, they were 
subjected to a torrent of profanity and excessive physical force that ended 
with the arresting officer's pushing one of them through the plate-glass 
window. More likely than not, a trial court would have accepted the police 
version. 
</P>
<P>
What changed this scenario, of course, was the videotape that NBC made of the 
whole incident with a hidden camera and a microphone. The edited tape, played 
and replayed in the last few days, strongly suggests that the version of events 
related by activists Don Jackson and Jeff Hill, both off-duty law-enforcement 
officers themselves, is closer to the truth than what the Long Beach policemen 
told their superiors in their formal report. The car was not weaving down the 
highway; the expletives came not from Jackson, who was booked for -- among 
other things -- suspicion of using offensive language, but from Officer Mark 
Dickey; it was Dickey who shoved Jackson's head and arm through the window, 
then lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police 
Department, has been criticized in some quarters for setting up this sting and 
for purposefully provoking an overreaction from the arresting officers by 
getting out of the car. Perhaps he was sassier than most citizens would 
consider prudent. But, whether or not the current investigations find that he 
was provocative, Jackson should be credited with turning the spotlight on a 
longstanding unresolved dispute that embroils many cities: Do predominantly 
white police departments routinely detain blacks without cause, harass them and 
use excessive force? 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Hill, leaders of the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, an 
organization dedicated to exposing racial discrimination in law-enforcement 
agencies, insist that the videotape proves their point. The roust on Pacific 
Coast Highway was "consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force" by 
the Long Beach force, says Jackson, citing dozens of citizen complaints from 
Long Beach blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he is right; certainly many blacks share his perception, sometimes 
reinforced by personal experience, of racism among the police. But the 
videotape doesn't tell the whole tale. It doesn't explain why the Long Beach 
officers stopped that car last Saturday night, it doesn't prove whether Officer 
Dickey genuinely felt menaced by Jackson, it doesn't determine whether there 
was "lawful necessity" for the force that Dickey used, and it emphatically does 
not establish a pattern of racism in Long Beach or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Those are all issues, particularly the question of whether it was an isolated 
incident or part of a pattern, that should be investigated by the Los Angeles 
district attorney's office and the FBI. We would urge that all parties 
cooperate with these inquiries -- including NBC, which so far has balked at 
releasing a full, unedited videotape. That is the only way, as Long Beach Mayor 
Ernie Kell said so forcefully Tuesday, "to find out what happened here and make 
sure it never happens again."

PEOPLE: 2 SOUTHMARK EXECUTIVES QUIT IN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southmark Corp.'s two top officers have resigned, breaking a weeklong deadlock 
on the troubled Dallas real estate concern's four-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark said Gene Phillips, chairman, president and chief executive, and 
William Friedman, vice chairman and secretary, had resigned as officers and 
directors. Arthur Weiss, former assistant to the chairman, will replace 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark said the resignations end a deadlock on the board without protracted 
litigation at a time the company needs to resolve a severe cash squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
"Much has been made in the press of transactions among Southmark and its 
executives and related companies. I want to assure our investors that the 
company's management and its board of directors are dedicated to operating the 
company for the primary benefit of its security holders, to respecting the 
integrity of Southmark's public subsidiaries, and to scrupulous compliance with 
regulatory requirements," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The board hit an impasse last week when two outside directors refused to 
automatically renew $10 million in loans that the two officers had borrowed to 
cover margin calls after the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in Dallas-based Southmark, which have slumped in the past year, closed 
up 12.5 cents at $2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Several investor groups, including the Pritzker family of Chicago, were 
reported to have held talks with Southmark about acquiring all or part of the 
firm.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: COMPUTERS HAVE SPIN DOCTORS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY designs microcomputer applications for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by my mail, many people are concerned about the reliability of the hard 
disk drives in their IBM and compatible personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
There's a good reason: Hard disks are wonderful when they work and disastrous 
when they fail. 
</P>
<P>
A hard disk drive, also known as a fixed disk drive, is a device installed 
inside a computer that stores application programs and data files. Using one or 
more magnetic-coated platters spinning at high speed, it stores information the 
same way removable floppy disks do. 
</P>
<P>
But hard disks have much greater storage capacity than floppy disks. The 
computer can also get at programs and data stored on a hard disk much faster 
than if they are on a floppy disk, which boosts overall computer performance. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, portions of a hard disk can go bad, causing data to be lost. If 
there is a failure in the critical area known as the file allocation table, 
which maps where all your data is stored, you can lose everything on the disk. 
In other words, you have what's called a hard disk crash. If you don't have 
backup copies of your programs and files on floppies or tape, they are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, an arsenal of software is now available that should help ease 
computer users' concerns. The three programs described here help prevent 
calamities by testing hard disks for signs of weakness and making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintains History of Problems 
</P>
<P>
A process called "low-level reformatting" is used to strengthen the disk 
magnetism to make storage more reliable. Portions that can't be fixed are 
marked so that nothing will be stored there and existing data at such locations 
is moved elsewhere. All three programs also can change the "interleave factor," 
which controls the order in which data is stored on the disk. That maneuver can 
make the computer faster if the old interleave factor was not proper. 
</P>
<P>
Disk Technician Advanced ($190) from Prime Solutions Inc. of San Diego 
maintains a history of problems it finds each time it tests the hard disk. It 
uses that information to predict impending failures before they happen. Weak 
areas are reformatted. The program also blocks off bad areas and moves the data 
stored there to better locations on the hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
Optune from Gazelle Systems of Provo, Utah, ($100) combines programs that test 
disk integrity and reformat and change disk interleaving. It also has a feature 
that pulls together disk files when they become fragmented, which improves 
computer performance. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive of the three programs is SpinRite, to which I devoted a 
full review last July. At $59 from Gibson Research Corp. of Laguna Niguel, it 
offers disk testing and disk reformatting to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
Disk Technician Advanced is meant to be run every day so that it can keep track 
of how well your hard disk is behaving. It detects various degrees of problems 
and when they threaten to become serious; it moves data safely out of harm's 
way and prevents the computer from using the problem section. 
</P>
<P>
The program runs three types of tests, automatically determining which is 
appropriate. On a 20-megabyte hard disk, the daily test takes about three 
minutes, the weekly test ranges from about 30 minutes to an hour and the 
monthly test can go up to about three hours. The program's speed will vary with 
the speed of your computer and hard disk. You'll probably want to do the weekly 
test while you're at lunch and let the monthly test run overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the seriousness of the problems, the program would do one of two 
things: It could reformat the problem portion of the disk and then monitor the 
area in subsequent tests, or the program could move the data elsewhere and mark 
the sector as a bad one so that no more data is placed there. For instance, on 
my 70-megabyte hard disk, the program currently is monitoring about 70,000 
bytes of data that it suspects are stored on weak sections of the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Disk Technician Advanced has the ability to reformat the entire disk and also 
change the interleave factor. But it is more reluctant to reformat than the 
other two. The instruction manual, in fact, recommends that such reformatting 
be done only on PC/AT and 386 class computers, not on the less powerful PC/XT 
or compatibles. 
</P>
<P>
SpinRite and Optune recommend low-level reformatting periodically to strengthen 
the magnetic signals of the disk. (SpinRite recommends reformat ting every 
three months, and Optune recommends yearly intervals.) 
</P>
<P>
I cannot say that Disk Technician Advanced has saved a disk drive that could 
not be saved by Optune or SpinRite. I can say that I used all three programs to 
attempt to recover data from a crashed hard disk in a PC/XT on which none of 
the programs previously had been used. Neither SpinRite nor Optune could even 
detect the drive's presence in the computer. Disk Technician Advanced at least 
found the drive and spent about half an hour grinding through it trying to find 
usable data before it gave up and reported the crash to be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Disk Technician Advanced runs more automatically than the other two programs. 
For instance, the user does not have to tell it how many hard disk drives are 
installed in the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Another nice feature is a small accessory program you can install that moves 
the recording heads of the drive to a safe location whenever the drive hasn't 
been used for about seven seconds. (Word processing and spreadsheet programs 
leave the drive idle for long periods while you type words and numbers.) The 
benefit is that if you have a sudden power failure, the recording head won't 
fall onto data stored on the disk and ruin it. 
</P>
<P>
Optune focuses on keeping files intact to improve computer performance. The 
more files are used, the more fragmented they become when stored on the disk 
because there may not be room to store them contiguously. 
</P>
<P>
Optune rewrites the files so that all are stored contiguously. Even if you use 
Disk Technician or SpinRite, your machine will benefit from using Optune's 
"optimization" routine. It takes only a minute or two for a 20-megabyte drive 
if done frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The program also can test disk drive integrity with any one of four methods. 
The least rigorous takes two to four minutes, and the most thorough lasts three 
to six hours. The manual recommends some level of testing at least once a 
month. If weak areas are found, they are marked so that data will not be placed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Optune has the most attractive screen appearance and the best instruction 
manual of the three. 
</P>
<P>
SpinRite's manual is the most technical and has the most cumbersome setup 
procedure. Casual computer users are likely to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
It claims to have the most rigorous disk-testing procedures and it certainly 
hurls a lot of technical data at the user as testing progresses. It does not 
have file optimization or a database to track the history of disk performance. 
</P>
<P>
I know of several instances when SpinRite has restored failure-prone hard 
drives to proper operation. I also believe that Disk Technician Advanced or 
Optune would have done the same. 
</P>
<P>
All three programs are based on the likelihood that sooner or later your hard 
disk will fail without the preventive maintenance these products provide. You 
could gamble that the premise is wrong. But keep your backups current just in 
case.

JACK SMITH: PART TRANS AND ANOTHER PART HUMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I stand uneasily astride the past and the Brave New World envisioned by the 
futurist who has changed his name from F. M. Esfandiary to FM-2030. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently FM-2030 adopted his new name to be more in keeping with the digital 
society we live in. 
</P>
<P>
(Our recent story about FM-2030, by Connie Koenenn, didn't say whether he is 
married or not, but if he is, I wonder how his wife likes being known as Mrs. 
F.M-2030. I suppose it's not much worse than being known as Mrs. Smith.) 
</P>
<P>
It is Mrs. Smith who has been trying to drag me or push me into the the Age of 
Transhumans, which FM-2030 describes as "a 21st Century era of new evolutionary 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Transhumans, Koenenn suggests, are those who take readily to such technological 
innovations as personal computers, mobile cellular telephones, electronic mail 
and telebanking. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in an electronic environment," FM-2030 says, "a fast-response 
environment. If you don't avail yourself of the technology, you will find you 
are outdated." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously my wife is worried that I will become outdated. First she urged me to 
buy a computer, then she bought a modem for it, then she bought me a compact 
disc player, and now she has bought me a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
I resisted all the way. Now, several years into its use, I admit that the 
computer was a good idea. It is so much easier to write on than a typewriter. 
The modem was a blessing, though I didn't even hook it up until six months 
after she gave it to me. The modem makes it possible for me to send my copy 
directly into The Times computer over my telephone, thus making it unnecessary 
for me (or my wife) to drive it into The Times every day. 
</P>
<P>
To that degree, I am a Transhuman. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, though, I consider the fax machine an extravagance and a 
disaster. She gave it to me for Christmas. I was dumbfounded. "What will I ever 
use it for?" I protested. 
</P>
<P>
She said I could have The Times library send clippings to me. I pointed out 
that my own library, plus the daily newspaper, and all the other publications 
we receive, give me more information than I need. And anything else I can get 
over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
I saw a fax ad in the paper and was dismayed at the price. She said, "You paid 
that much for a dress for me." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," I admitted, "but you've already worn that dress more times than I'm ever 
going to use a fax machine. I don't need a fax machine." 
</P>
<P>
She said I was being ungracious. 
</P>
<P>
I don't like being ungracious, so I asked our older son, who was an Air Force 
radio technician during the Vietnam War, to install it for me. He came over the 
other night and worked for about two hours on it. He said he had connected it 
to our second telephone line, which is used mainly by people calling the wrong 
number. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning he phoned to say he was going to send me something over his 
fax machine, to see if mine worked. While we were talking a female voice cut 
in, saying the phone company was unable to complete my call. I found out that 
we were talking over both lines at once. I hung up and tried to call him back. 
I couldn't get a dial tone. He called back. The red light by the hold button 
went on. I found that I could talk to him only on the hold line. Both the other 
lines were inoperative. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have done something to the phone," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
As I write this the phone is still inoperative and I have yet to send or 
receive anything on the fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
I have also never used an automatic teller or a telephone credit card. I used 
to use the CD with earphones when I was working out on the rowing machine, but 
I've dropped both. 
</P>
<P>
So here I stand, with one foot in the Age of Transhumans and one foot out. 
</P>
<P>
I just pray that my wife doesn't buy me a cellular telephone. l don't need a 
cellular telephone that doesn't work. I've already got a telephone that doesn't 
work.

ERMA BOMBECK: SHE'S PERFECTLY SUITED TO THIS SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erma Bombeck is taking a one-week vacation. This Best of Bombeck was originally 
published in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All my life I have been looking for a sport that features a cute outfit that I 
can wear to do my grocery shopping, requires no more effort than putting one 
foot in front of the other, allows me to keep my next meal strapped to my back, 
and offers the cheap thrill of having someone breathe heavily behind me. 
</P>
<P>
I've found it! Cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine. No ambulance parked at the bottom of the hill. No tents at the finish 
line offering blankets and intravenous feeding. No standing around trying to 
find your pulse to see if it is accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
I know there is a lot of curiosity about cross-country skiing, so I will try 
not to get technical. 
</P>
<P>
As with any sport, basically what we are talking about is coordination. I 
cannot tell you how important it is to coordinate your entire outfit at one 
time. The knickers should fit well and be something eye-catching, preferably 
matching one's lightweight jacket. A cotton turtleneck or scarf tucked smartly 
under a blouse is a nice touch. Socks should be dark to help keep the calves 
from looking like piano legs. A lot of people wear thermal underwear, but 
personally I find it too warm for the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
What I really love about the sport is that you don't have to wear those awful 
caps that flatten your hair and make it look like an unmade bed. I prefer 
earmuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Another tip is to avoid needless exertion. That is why I fry my chicken the 
night before and pack the knapsack with small bread-and-butter sandwiches, 
thermoses of hot soup and hot chocolate, candy bars and, of course, a 
corkscrew. 
</P>
<P>
Setting your pace as you go is very important in cross-country skiing. If you 
tear off in a kick-glide movement the way you are supposed to, you will never 
meet anybody. 
</P>
<P>
As with most sports, cross-country skiing improves with time and practice. 
After a while, you learn that if you look too frightened to move, someone will 
clamp your skis on for you, pull your gloved hands through your poles and never 
leave your side. 
</P>
<P>
As for the promise of great personal satisfaction, I wouldn't know. Maybe I 
will discover that next week when I venture out of the parking lot.

ART BUCHWALD: WHAT A WONDERFUL PLOT FOR A MOVIE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was just eight years ago when the head of Warner Brothers studios called me 
in and said, "We're going to shoot a movie about a President of the United 
States in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
"Great," I replied. "Who will play the title role?" 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted Mickey Rooney, but he's not available. What do you think of Ronald 
Reagan?" 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be kidding. He only plays nice guys." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what everyone says. But suppose we had a President of the United States 
who really was a nice guy -- even nicer than his best friend Jimmy Stewart. I 
want to cast Nancy Davis as Ron's wife and create a helluva wardrobe for her. 
This picture is going to have glitz." 
</P>
<P>
"The audiences are dying for glitz," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
He stood up from behind his desk and started pacing. "At the opening of the 
film I see Ronnie riding his horse right up to the front door of the White 
House, and the horse knocking on it with his hoof. All the servants are lined 
up and the head butler smiles and says, 'Welcome home, Mr. President. Your room 
is this way.' " 
</P>
<P>
"That's all well and good," I said. "But what's the story?" 
</P>
<P>
The studio head slapped himself on the thigh with a riding crop. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron has come to Washington to root out waste and corruption in government, 
something the people there don't understand. But his strong leadership prevails 
and before he is finished, half of his own staff has either been fired or 
indicted." 
</P>
<P>
"That is a good start." 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, I'm going to have Nancy turning up at all of Ronnie's 
meetings, in different outfits, yelling at everyone she meets, 'Just say no.' " 
</P>
<P>
"But where does that lead?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"As the story unfolds, the plot poses the question, 'Can a nice guy spend eight 
years in the White House without becoming disenchanted with the government?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Does Ron have a crisis of confidence?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he does. When underlings, led by a Marine lieutenant colonel try to 
end-run the Oval Office and set up their own clandestine operation with the 
Iranians, Ronnie deals with it as a President should." 
</P>
<P>
"How's that?" 
</P>
<P>
"He says he doesn't know anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the major plot of the film?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. The real story is that Ron makes up with the Russians." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to believe that. Reagan hates the Commies." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the beauty of the plot. Ronnie, a man who detests Communists, finds 
good in all of them. We have a big scene on top of the Kremlin wall when Ron 
and Nancy embrace Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, as the Soviet troops 
march by in the May Day parade." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Brezhnev was in charge of the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
"In the picture we're changing his name to Gorbachev, and making the Russian 
leader much younger for dramatic effect." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good script, but there doesn't appear to be any conflict in it. When 
does Ron stand up and fight?" 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't -- but Nancy does. This movie portrays the struggle between two 
strong-willed women trying to protect their men. I want to have a hair-pulling 
fight between Nancy and Raisa in front of Lenin's Tomb." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds fine to me. How much will this production cost?" 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "Would you believe a trillion dollars?"

<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Weintraub has campaigned for George Bush for more than 20 years, dating 
back to singing for him when he ran for Congress from Texas. Jane and Jerry 
Weintraub also have a summer house near the Bushes' family place at 
Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
With such close presidential ties, Jane will be in the spotlight today at the 
luncheon Robin Parsky of Pasadena and Grega Daly co-host in the Potomac Room of 
the Ritz Carlton to introduce Jane to Washingtonians. The affair is timed so 
that Almost-First Lady Barbara Bush can stop in after the Salute to the First 
Lady at Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robin is the wife of Gerry Parsky, former U.S. assistant secretary of the 
Treasury, a senior partner in Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and a business 
partner with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Simon. Grega is the 
wife of Leo A. Daly, whose large architectural firm designed the United 
Airlines terminal at LAX; they live on Embassy Row on Massachusetts Avenue in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list is indicative of ascending social prowess: Acceptances are in 
from Georgette Mosbacher, wife of the Secretary-designate of Commerce Robert 
Mosbacher; Gayle Wilson, wife of California Sen. Pete Wilson, Penny Korth, 
co-chairman of the Inaugural, and Joan Holt, wife of Bobby Holt, the other 
co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
More have come from Alexandre de Borchgrave, Baroness de Portenova (Sandra) 
from Texas and Acapulco; Anne Nitze, Eliska Coolidge and Washington journalist 
Betty Beale. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles will be represented by Gloria Holden, Carole Cook, Teran Davis, 
Iris Dart, Phyliss Hennigan, Abbe Leff and Rosemary Tomich. Also in the coterie 
will be Faye Spanos of Stockton and Willa Dean Lyon (wife of William Lyon, the 
Orange County real estate tycoon). 
</P>
<P>
Among other Californians on the Washington scene, hosting other parties, will 
be David Murdock, entertaining at a reception for top Bush donors on Friday 
before the Inaugural Ball. Typical of the numerous individual and embassy 
parties concurrent with the big major Inaugural bashes was the one Brad Freeman 
and Steve Dart hosted -- cocktails and dinner -- Wednesday evening at the 
Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia and Dr. Roscoe Webb of Bel-Air are among Angelenos in Washington for the 
festivities. Roscoe and President-elect Bush are both Yale graduates. 
</P>
<P>
IT'S OFFICIAL: The American Cinematheque will honor Steven Spielberg at its 
annual gala benefit, the Moving Picture Ball, on April 1. Sydney Pollack, 
chairman of Cinematheque's board of directors, reports that Spielberg was the 
unanimous choice. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine and Sid Sheinberg will be honorary chairmen; 1,200 are expected at the 
Century Plaza ballroom. Peter Dekom, Cinematheque president, announces the New 
York Times has given a grant to underwrite costs and that the funds raised -- 
the goal is $350,000 -- will go for operations and planning. Gary Essert, 
founder/artistic director, reminds that Spielberg has directed five of the 10 
all-time top grossing films. 
</P>
<P>
OVERSOLD: Erlenne Sprague is both elated and sad. More than 175 checks more 
than the 400 capacity have come in for the Colleagues luncheon Feb. 14 honoring 
First Lady Nancy Reagan and benefiting the Children's Institute and its work 
with abused children. Here's the solution: Every nook and cranny around the 
Crystal Room of the Beverly Hills Hotel, including the bar area, will be 
table-set for an additional 100 guests, but the rest of the checks will be 
refunded. Don't despair. There will be other luncheons! 
</P>
<P>
SALUTE NOLAN: Diane Becket and Beverly Cruse are up to their hemlines in plans 
for the USC Town and Gown fashion luncheon March 2 saluting couturier Nolan

Director Alan Parker, who has two Golden Globe award nominations for 
"Mississippi Burning," has signed a three-year production and development 
agreement with Tri-Star Pictures. Tri-Star will have exclusive, first-look 
rights to film projects that Parker develops. The deal also enables Parker to 
undertake "personal projects at modest budgets," Tri-Star said Wednesday. 
Although "Mississippi Burning" is an Orion release, Tri-Star distributed 
Parker's controversial 1987 film "Angel Heart." Parker also has plans to direct 
a film version of "Les Miserables" for the studio. ALEENE MacMINN

A previously unknown piano concerto by Franz Liszt is due to have its premiere 
next season by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, after being discovered and 
pieced together over the last nine months by Jay Rosenblatt, a Chicago 
musicologist. Rosenblatt found the work (tentatively dated from 1839) last 
April in Budapest, Hungary, while gathering materials for a doctoral 
dissertation on Liszt. An archivist in Weimar, East Germany, had catalogued the 
manuscript as belonging to an early version of a familiar E-flat Liszt 
concerto. However examination proved that it had no material in common with 
that work. The newly discovered manuscript, Rosenblatt said, was "shuffled like 
a deck of cards" among the known E-flat concerto. ALEENE MacMINN

THE KITCHEN CABINET: HIGHER TECH IN IMPROVED COOKTOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slowly, yet surely, the old electric range surface is being replaced in 
kitchens all over the world by a sleek-looking cooktop. It's attractively 
smooth. No more ugly burners sticking out. No nooks and crannies to clean. 
(Remember how much extra time and effort you had to spend scrubbing those 
grease-laden coil systems and rusted drip bowls, lest they become an eyesore in 
the kitchen?) 
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary, high-tech, smooth top is made of a heat-resistant glass 
ceramic surface -- impervious to spills, grease and encrusted deposits. (Don't 
mistake this for the old ceramic surfaces that developed instant heat stains 
that were difficult to remove.) Today, this new cooking system accounts for 
about 60% of all electric range sales in West Germany, 50% in Switzerland and 
Austria and 45% in England. More than a dozen U.S. and Canadian appliance 
manufacturers are now incorporating this system into their electric ranges. 
Also, based on positive surveys, industry experts project an additional 75 
million purchases over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
By now you've probably seen this new cooktop surface in ranges by companies 
such as Amana, Dacor, Gaggenau, Caloric, Miele, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag, 
Modern Maid, Roper, Kitchen Aid, Sears, Tappan, Creda and Thermador. Flush to 
the countertop and looking extremely simple by way of its subtle smoothness, 
there's more to the system than meets the eye. An intricate ingenuity lies in 
both the composition of the glass panel as well as in the heating elements 
hidden beneath the cooking surface. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an inside story from the primary supplier of this product: Schott 
America, a subsidiary of Schott Glaswerke of Mainz, West Germany. Called the 
Ceran-Top-System, the unit consists of the following: a black glass-ceramic 
panel; the hidden heating elements and their mountings; a steel frame has a 
metallic finish or comes in one of several colors, and the burner controls. 
</P>
<P>
The attractive glass-ceramic panels are translucent, nonporous and available in 
several decorator designs with a wonderful variety of cooking zone placements. 
But beauty is not only skin-deep; these glossy panels are made to withstand 
constant temperatures of more than 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Sudden and severe 
temperature changes do not affect them and as a result they don't crack or 
warp. Another functional consideration is that they are designed to transmit 
heat efficiently from the hidden burners directly up to the cookware, with the 
rest of the surface remaining cool. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on individual wants and needs, the Ceran systems are available with a 
variety of electric heating options. The latest electric cooking systems 
include radiant, high-speed, ballast, "quicklight" and halogen, the last of 
which is attracting attention as an energy-saving concept. If you like the 
instantaneous on-and-off response of gas, the halogen elements uses halogen 
light bulbs that glow red when hot. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of this whole system is that all the heating coils and mountings are 
hidden beneath a glass panel and are designed with consideration for safety and 
maximum efficiency. The burners range from six to nine inches in diameter, some 
designed with dual circuits to accommodate two sizes of cook pots. Temperature 
limiters, which prevent the cooktop from overheating and aluminum pots from 
melting, are standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of pots, the manufacturer recommends a few simple rules of thumb to 
get the best performance: 
</P>
<P>
"Match the cookware and the cooking zone. The base of the pot or pan should be 
as wide as the cooking zone on which it's used to get maximum efficiency and 
shortest boiling times. 
</P>
<P>
"Use heavy cookware with flat, smooth bottoms. Nothing fancy is required. 
Commercially available pots and pans are fine. If made of metal, use thick 
gauge. All cookware when hot, should sit flush on the cooking surface. Pots and 
pans with flat, stainless-steel sandwich bottoms have produced the shortest 
boiling times and maximum efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning, of course, is a cinch. Ordinary spills can easily be cleaned with 
recommended cleaners applied to a moistened sponge or cloth. Avoid wool and 
abrasive cleaners and treat spills that contain sugar immediately. Burnt 
deposits can be easily removed with a razor-edged glass scraper. 
</P>
<P>
Many buyers are attracted to this system by the bright red glow of the heating 
elements that are visible through the glass-ceramic panel. Combined with this 
visible glow, an indicator light that remains on until the surface is cool to 
the touch ensures safe operation of the cooktop. 
</P>

ABOUT WINE: MOUNTAIN OR COAST, TWO CABERNETS SHOW NAPA HAS NOTHING ON THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some ways, there couldn't be two more dissimilar wine makers than Patrick 
Campbell and Gary Eberle, but after the superficial elements are discarded, the 
ways in which these two gentlemen make a similar statement with Cabernet 
Sauvignon is striking. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, owner of Laurel Glen Vineyards in Sonoma County, is slight of build, 
clean-shaven and rather reserved; Eberle, who owns Eberle Winery in Paso 
Robles, is a big, burly bear of a man with a backwoods beard, a frame roughly 
twice the size of Campbell's, and eyes that seem to radiate light of enthusiasm 
and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Eberle was a football lineman at Penn State and had offers to turn pro; 
Campbell, who suffered from polio at age 5 and has little use of his legs, 
earned a living during and after college by playing the viola with symphony 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Both today are wine makers in out-of-the-way regions not heavily traveled by 
wine lovers, let alone potential wine lovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Brilliant Men 
</P>
<P>
And yet in their own way, these two brilliant men are making strides with 
Cabernet Sauvignon that rival what's being done in the better known Napa 
Valley. Indeed, if either were in the Napa Valley, his fame would certainly be 
more pervasive today than it is. 
</P>
<P>
The use of the word brilliant above is not casual, and here the parallels 
between them begin: Both earned master's degrees in fields unrelated to wine 
making, Eberle in zoology (he came within an eyelash of a doctorate in 
cytogenetics) at Louisiana State University, Campbell in philosophy, at 
Harvard, no less. And both got into wine making more or less by a side door. 
For neither wanted to do this for a living, preferring grape growing to wine 
making. 
</P>
<P>
But both had a sense of the artistic, and both also realized that raising the 
grape through adolescence and then leaving it to be molded into its final adult 
shape by another was not very fatherly. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing comparisons between two such disparate souls and regions may be 
stretching a point, but I felt it unavoidable after visiting with both recently 
and realizing that often the fame of a wine is in relation to its region, and 
that the current fad is to praise Napa Cabernet. It's almost as if that phrase 
alone defines high quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Honors 
</P>
<P>
Eberle, however, pointed out that his Cabernets, starting with the first in 
1979, have won as many top honors in wine competitions as any other Cabernet in 
California, and he wondered aloud why he must spend fully 181 days a year on 
the road, traveling to various American cities to promote his brand. 
</P>
<P>
And Campbell, who makes a Cabernet to rival anything done in California today, 
acknowledges that were he in Napa, he'd probably be better recognized. 
</P>
<P>
But both men also point out that if they were in Napa, they could never make 
the wines they make, and both are extremely proud of the soils in which they 
have chosen to sink their roots. 
</P>
<P>
Eberle began his wine-making career at nearby Estrella River Winery and 
actually got his feet wet first in planting various grape varieties in a 
one-acre experimental plot. Working with the University of California at Davis, 
Estrella's owners wanted to see what grapes grew best in this fertile soil an 
hour's drive due west of the central San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Eberle made wine at Estrella from 1977 through 1979. Then he and his wife, 
Jeannie, left to open their own winery. At the time he toyed with the notion of 
moving to the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"But I asked myself, where were the best Cabernet grapes I had ever worked 
with, and they are right here in Paso Robles," said Eberle, so he stayed. His 
new winery, on California 46 just east of California 101, opened in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Campbell had earned a degree at Cal Poly Pomona, and after two years 
studying philosophy at Harvard with a religious specialty, he moved back to 
California and into a Buddhist monastery, Genjo-Ji, on Sonoma Mountain behind 
the small town of Glen Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty Spartan," said Campbell, adding, "when I saw they had a three-acre 
vineyard, I jumped into it." He loved tending the vines (they were Palomino 
grapes and were sold to Sebastiani for sherry production), and despite his 
handicap, he handled most of the chores. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, he and his wife, Faith, found a 42-acre parcel of land less than a 
third of a mile from the monastery; the name was Laurel Glen. Its Cabernet 
grapes had long been sold to others, notably Kenwood and Chateau St. Jean, and 
Campbell felt he would simply continue to sell grapes. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1976. Campbell started taking wine-making classes at Santa Rosa 
Junior College and by 1979, a homemade wine from his own property turned out so 
well he decided to make wine commercially. The first, in 1981, was a hit, 
winning all sorts of awards and gaining instant fame for the modest fellow. 
</P>
<P>
The soils that Eberle and Campbell till, and the climates in which they work, 
are widely different, leading to different styles of wine. 
</P>
<P>
In Paso Robles, Eberle works calcareous, sandy clay soil on gently sloped 
vineyards. And the climate offers very warm summer days and cool nights. Huge 
temperature swings are common, giving Eberle very cool nights even when daytime 
temperatures soar near 100. This is due to an ocean breeze that wafts over a 
low-sitting mountain to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma Mountain is a small, remote appellation sitting above the lush Sonoma 
Valley where Jack London wrote "Call of the Wild" and other novels. Few 
wineries make wine from these grapes, and the reason is that production is 
fairly limited in these rocky, sloped vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Rocks of every sort, from volcanic to petrified wood, fill the variegated soil 
and make certain areas of the property better than others for wine. And the 
climate here can be a little dicey, with temperatures in some years not truly 
warm enough to get grapes fully ripe. 
</P>
<P>
The wines of these two wineries are, thus, quite different. The Eberle Cabernet 
tends more toward a combination of herbal and chocolate, with hints of pine and 
tarragon. They are very consistent from year to year and appear to age best 
within 10 years of their production. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Eberle Cabernet, one of my favorites, sampled again recently, is 
reaching a point of drinkability, though it will surely age well into the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Laurel Glen wines have thus far been a little less consistent, and they tend to 
be a little more tightly knit and less open when released. However, they are 
also a little more approachable when first out because of an intriguing red 
currant lilt to the otherwise raspberry-ish fruit. As the wine ages, hints of 
mineral and dried basil smells are released. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Laurel Glen, the first made by Campbell for commercial release, tasted 
for comparison last week, was spectacular. The fruit has not only stayed around 
for the ride but has opened further to reveal a slight anise quality to add to 
the remaining "curranty" smells. It may be found on some restaurant wine lists 
and is a grand experience. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Laurel Glen wine is a bit more classic, needing perhaps 10 to 12 
years in the bottle before it begins to open up fully. It is also a very 
limited production wine (about 4,000 cases in a good year but far less in a 
poor one) and now sells for $20 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
That may be a lot of money, but Cabernet was hard hit by weather problems in 
1988 and Campbell has but 1,200 cases of that vintage for a market that is 
increasing its demand for his wine as they discover it. 
</P>
<P>
Eberle offers his Cabernets for $12. The wines are more California-like and 
have a broader appeal, though they have the tannins needed for the aging, and 
the '81 has now smoothed out sufficiently, indicating that seven years from the 
harvest is what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Tannin 
</P>
<P>
Both Campbell and Eberle admit that their growing regions are not the target of 
NASA-type research, so each vintage for them is a new experience and they are 
still experimenting. Laurel Glen's 1982 Cabernet, for instance, was not 
particularly engaging, and Campbell admits he could have done much better with 
it had he known then what he now knows. 
</P>
<P>
To guard against problems like 1982 in the future, Campbell has developed a 
second label, Counterpoint, that will be a lower-priced wine comprising some of 
the barrels that don't add anything interesting to the Laurel Glen wine. 
</P>
<P>
Both men also make other wines, with Eberle's Chardonnay another medal winner, 
and a lovely, balanced effort every year. The 1986 ($12) is an excellent 
example of fruit and richness not overdone. Laurel Glen made a small amount of 
dessert-style wine similar to a Sauternes in 1985. The wine, called Cochino de 
Oro, is superb (it sells for $12.50 a half bottle), but it's available only by 
mail from the Winewright's Register. For details, call (800) 321-4300. Only 30 
cases remain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handsome Tasting Room 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in learning more about Eberle may visit his handsome tasting 
room on California 46 four miles east of Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
As for Campbell, his small operation is located off a remote trail on Sonoma 
Mountain and is hard to find. Moreover, Campbell still does most of the 
vineyard work and wine-making himself, so he usually has little time for 
visitors and consequently has no tasting room. Moreover, he and Faith have 
three growing daughters, which makes him as much a family man as anything else.

LET'S EAT OUT: FETTUCCINE BAR OFFERS CHOICE OF 18 PASTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Fettuccine Bar in Agoura Hills looked inviting as we pulled into the 
parking lot. It was after dark and a soft glow from the pink walls and subtle 
lighting inside was coming through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Three old gas pumps still stand guard over the entrance, but even before 
California Fettuccine Bar opened a little more than two years ago, the building 
had been occupied by another restaurant for some time. Sometime way back, 
around the early '40's, however, it was actually a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
The tiled entry leads to a large room with vaulted ceiling and wooden floor. It 
has about 20 tables with pink-and-red linens and chrome and cane chairs. Six 
more tables are on an adjacent enclosed front porch. A few plants and 
contemporary art on the walls are about the only other additions to the simple 
decor. 
</P>
<P>
The rolls that were served soon after we were seated were one of the few 
disappointments during our visits. We're guessing from the chewy texture that 
they're warmed in an oven, but then microwaved at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
This shortcoming was quickly forgotten once the involtini di melanzane farcite 
e peperoni arrostiti antipasti arrived at our table. The very thinly sliced 
eggplant is broiled, then wrapped around goat cheese, marinated and served with 
roasted red peppers on a bed of lightly dressed greens. Three of each item 
makes it an ideal dish to share. 
</P>
<P>
The main portion of the menu is devoted to 18 types of pasta, all, except the 
tortellini and ravioli, prepared on the premises. These may be coupled with any 
of the restaurant's 40 or so tomato, cream or specialty sauces. While pondering 
our choices, we discovered an important point about this restaurant: Just 
because something isn't on the printed menu, doesn't necessarily mean it's 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
A member of our party was sure she had ordered clam sauce on a previous 
occasion, but couldn't find it listed. Questioning the waitress, we found clams 
were not only available, but served in three different styles. (We understand 
they will be included on the next menu to be printed.) So it pays to ask 
questions, because that dozen clams, prepared with white wine, tomatoes and 
basil and served on linguini, would have been a shame to miss. 
</P>
<P>
It also pays to do a little eavesdropping. After ordering a glass of the house 
Villa Banfi white wine, we overheard our waitress mention to the next table 
that a Venegazzu Pinot Grigio was offered by the glass. It turned out to be 
drier and more to our liking. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is intended to say that service is lacking. On the contrary, it's 
friendly and attentive. With a list of evening specials to present verbally 
(also listed on a large blackboard, but not visible from all tables), it's easy 
to understand a wine being overlooked or someone not mentioning items such as 
the clams. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, staff recommendations proved to be on target. We took the advice of 
having the salsa ai carciofi served with fettuccine al basilico, and it was a 
winner. The basil-flavored pasta was an excellent foil for the surprisingly 
light sauce of cream, baby artichokes, garlic and parsley sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A nightly special 14-ounce veal chop was not as lean as we expected, but had an 
intriguing sauce of radicchio, pancetta, tomatoes and wood-ear mushrooms. 
Because of the size, two of us had mentioned we would share the entree and, 
without our asking, it was sliced horizontally and arranged on two plates in 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Again, when it came to ordering dessert, it paid to ask questions. Although a 
chocolate-plum and hazelnut torte were very acceptable, we later learned they 
were not made in the restaurant. The Kaluha pecan pie our waitress presented 
after we asked her for the best in-house dessert, was by far the best of the 
trio. A very foamy cappuccino complemented it well. 
</P>
<P>
 California Fettuccine Bar, 29008 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, (818) 991-3000. A 
sister restaurant to La Bruschetta and Westwood Fettuccine Bar. Open for lunch,

FOOD BRIEFS: SHRIMP FARMING BOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commercial shrimp farming has increased dramatically in the last seven years, 
causing retail prices to drop and threatening the livelihood of fishermen, 
according to a San Diego-based trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, farms were responsible for producing 22% of the 
world's supply of this expensive and popular crustacean, Aquaculture Digest 
recently reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has quietly grown into a multibillion-dollar giant, lowering the 
prices in some markets and sending tremors through the shrimp-fishing 
industry," the article stated. 
</P>
<P>
Just as quietly, farmed shrimp have become the world's largest and most 
valuable aquaculture species, easily surpassing similar efforts to cultivate 
salmon, catfish and trout. 
</P>
<P>
More than 450,000 metric tons of farm-raised shrimp came to market last year 
with a $6 billion retail value. And total tonnage would have been 10% greater 
had not Bangladesh and Taiwan both experienced problems with their operations, 
the magazine found. 
</P>
<P>
Most shrimp aquaculture ventures are based in Asia, with the People's Republic 
of China believed to be the world leader with 22% of the total production. 
Other major producers include Ecuador, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Aquaculture Digest estimates that more than 40 countries farm shrimp to some 
degree whether in inland ponds, tanks or along coastal bays. The United States 
plays only a minor role in the global industry, and the domestic effort, about 
20 facilities, is based in South Carolina, Texas and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effect of these ventures has caused the wholesale and retail 
prices of medium-sized shrimp to decline. Farmers have yet to successfully 
produce the larger varieties; prices for these shrimp species remain unchanged 
and, in some cases, have even increased. 
</P>
<P>
There is a centuries-old tradition of fish farming in Southeast Asia. The 
modern industry, however, dates back only to the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the successes of the last decade, the process is vulnerable. According 
to Aquaculture Digest, Bangladesh lost much of its 1988 crop because of floods. 
The reason for a 70% reduction in Taiwan's harvest last year has yet to be 
ascertained. 
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters aside, the industry's greatest obstacle continues to be the 
difficulties in hatching shrimp larvae. The hatcheries remain the "weakest 
link" in the process, according to the report, because larvae are readily 
susceptible to bacterial and viral disease there. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the technology is much more reliable and cost-effective than the 
labor-intensive fishing methods in practice today. Furthermore, the wild-shrimp 
population has been depleted throughout the world because of overfishing and a 
general deterioration in water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"A farmer can produce shrimp cheaper than a fisherman can catch them," said Bob 
Rosenberry, publisher of Aquaculture Digest. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this disparity the fisherman will eventually become obsolete, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquaculture Digest estimates that several countries are undergoing a "boom" in 
shrimp farming that will far surpass current production levels, notably 
Thailand, the Philippines and China. 
</P>
<P>
Of regional importance, Mexico has also made a major financial commitment to 
aquaculture despite the presence of a sizable shrimp fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrimp farming is on the verge of taking off in Mexico. Currently it has 70 
farms, eight hatcheries, 25,000 acres in production and annual (harvest) of 
9,000 metric tons," the article stated. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrimp farming is developing at a very rapid pace throughout the world," said 
Rosenberry. "Some countries, such as Mexico and India, are just starting to 
jump into the business. When production from those two comes on line it will 
lower prices even more." 
</P>
<P>
Mistaken Impressions -- As some ingredient-conscious consumers may have known 
all along, many products promoted as health foods are far from being 
nutritionally superior to more conventional choices. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Berkeley Wellness Letter recently reviewed the category and found 
numerous faults with several of the more popular items. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be too quick to trust those labels that promise nutritional nirvana," 
the newsletter stated. "A food that has no cholesterol may still have lots of 
fat or sodium. The presence of 'natural' ingredients is no guarantee of good 
nutrition, nor is the absence of refined sugar, preservatives (and other 
additives)." 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter, published by the university's School of Public Health, 
encourages consumers to monitor so-called natural foods for potential dietary 
pitfalls. The best such method is simple: read the ingredient list printed on 
the label. The various components of the food are listed in descending order 
based on weight and, thus, provide a profile of a product's nutritional status. 
</P>
<P>
The Wellness Letter skewered some health foods by using just such information, 
in addition to basic eating guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Fat Content 
</P>
<P>
For instance, most people would be "better off" consuming a sugar-laden apple 
pie then some of the commercial carrot cakes on the market, the newsletter 
stated. Typically high in fat content, carrot cakes usually weigh in at about 
200 calories a slice or more -- and that's without considering the likely 
garnishes such as frosting or cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, carrots are healthful, but carrot cakes are surprisingly rich in 
drawbacks," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The same applies to many of the bran muffins on the market. Much has been made 
of the important role that bran, and its attendant fiber, can play in the diet. 
Even so, most of the commercial muffins available are loaded with more 
hydrogenated oils, sugar and eggs than oat or wheat bran. Determining whether 
these muffins are healthful depends, in part, upon whether they contain the 
nutritionally superior whole-wheat flour instead of more refined varieties, the 
review stated. 
</P>
<P>
"If a muffin weighs heavily in your hand and has a sticky surface, it is likely 
to have as many calories and fat as a cupcake," according to the Wellness 
Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Certain types of popcorn also warrant scrutiny, the newsletter stated. Plain 
popcorn -- if cooked without butter and salt -- is a no-fat and low-calorie 
food. But when excess amounts of oil are used in either the at-home or 
commercial versions, then the benefits are quickly lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Read the Label 
</P>
<P>
"Microwave corn and prepopped corn usually contain twice as many calories as 
conventional popcorn, (as well as) a hefty dose of salt and more fat per ounce 
than most cookies," the report found. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned with fat intake should also be cautioned about commercial 
"vegetarian pate." In order to compensate for the fatty texture found in 
traditional liver pates, the vegetable version often employs tropical oils such 
as palm kernel. These oils, which also includes coconut, are more highly 
saturated than some animal fats, according to the article. Diets high in 
saturated fats have been linked to increased risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Also worth considering is that the predominant vegetable in many of the 
commercial pates is potato starch, the Wellness Letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Certain frozen foods, particularly those labeled as "vegetarian," pose some 
nutritional problems. One popular vegetable lasagna, the report found, 
contained only 225 calories, but 50% of those were from fat. A competing meat 
lasagna, on the other hand, had only 32% of its calories from saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by a healthy-sounding name," 
the Wellness Letter stated. "Always read labels."

HINTS FROM HELOISE: MAKING AN INSTANT LID FROM HOT PLASTIC WRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Last week I took some pork and beans in a glass bowl to a potluck 
dinner. I didn't have a lid for the bowl and I knew the beans would, no doubt, 
spill in my car on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Then I remembered how plastic wrap clings to the sides of any glass bowl when 
heated in the microwave oven. I heated the beans on HIGH (100%) for a couple of 
minutes and the plastic wrap created a tight seal so the beans didn't make a 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lids on my casserole dishes aren't very tight, so this tip could 
also be used to make sure food doesn't spill while being transported even when 
it has a lid. Also, the plastic wrap seal keeps the food hot longer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KELLY, Chandler, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR KEITH: There is an easy solution to this. Just mix one cup of rubbing 
alcohol to a quart of water and use this solution on the cloth when cleaning 
the freezer. Since rubbing alcohol will not freeze, the cloth will not stick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My mother-in-law told me the best way to make poached eggs. First 
of all, spray the pan lightly with a non-stick vegetable spray, fry the eggs 
until the whites are barely set, then add about one tablespoon of water. Cover 
tightly and turn the heat down very low. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a semi-poached egg that is not greasy and there is no turning 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUTH, Honeoye, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

SPINACH SQUARES 
</P>
<P>
1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup margarine, melted

<P>
1 cup minced onion 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces cooked spinach, drained thoroughly 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, salt, baking powder, milk, margarine, eggs, onion, Cheddar 
cheese and spinach. Place in greased 9-inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees 30 
minutes. Cut into squares. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR VIRGINIA: This is a perfect example of when less is more. By simply 
reducing the problem ingredients in the recipe, you end up with a finished 
product that is more enjoyable from both a health and taste standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The margarine was easily reduced by half and egg substitute worked beautifully 
in place of the eggs, so the fat and cholesterol are greatly reduced. I have 
found that low-fat Cheddar cheese is always appropriate as a substitute for the 
traditional high-fat variety, and I was able to reduce the amount of cheese 
called for without missing it. 
</P>
<P>
I think you will agree that this recipe gives more of everything you want from 
food by using less of the things you don't really need.

THE BUTCHER: SIMPLE WAYS TO SAVE AT THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion, we can eat a lot better for a lot less if we follow a few simple 
common-sense procedures when shopping in the American supermarket. The average 
supermarket today has hundreds of thousands of different items lining its 
shelves to tempt us into parting with as much of our cash as possible. Most of 
those items we don't need. The trick is to shop for and buy what we really want 
and need, and not to be tempted by the things we can do without. 
</P>
<P>
The place to begin shopping is at home around the kitchen table on the day the 
Food Section comes out in this paper. The advertised specials offer good 
opportunity for savings -- particularly on meat. Items like whole body 
chickens, turkeys and often various cuts of beef, pork and lamb are often used 
as loss-leaders. That means they offer these items for less than they paid for 
them in order to get you into the store, where you can be tempted by all those 
thousands of other items that are not "on special." 
</P>
<P>
Plan weekly menus around some of the advertised specials and make a list . . . 
but don't carve it in stone and carry it to the market like Moses coming down 
from the mountain. Be a little flexible. Not all money-saving specials are 
advertised. That is particularly true in the meat department where the 
department manager often lowers the price of a particular cut in order to move 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shop at Same Market 
</P>
<P>
Unless there is some red-hot special that makes it worth a special trip, you 
are best off doing most of your shopping at the same market every week. Pick a 
convenient one where the clerks are reasonably friendly and helpful and get to 
know it. Learn where things are and who to go to for help if you need any. The 
more familiar you are with the layout, the less time you'll need to spend there 
and, believe it, time is money -- the more time you spend shopping, the more 
money you'll spend. 
</P>
<P>
Try to do the major portion of shopping on one day. More people spend more 
money on groceries -- meat in particular -- because they shop for only one meal 
at a time. When you go shopping with "What am I going to have for dinner 
tonight?" in mind, you are almost certainly looking for something quick. You 
know as well as I do that one of the most expensive and often overpriced 
supermarket commodities is called convenience. A frozen entree can cost 10 
times what the same dish would cost if you planned ahead and made it from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
A steak or a pork chop may cook quickly, but you'll pay far less per pound for 
either if you plan ahead, buy a family pack or a roast and cut your own and 
freeze some for later use. 
</P>
<P>
In my opnion, thinking big can save you a fortune, not only on meat but 
throughout the store. When chickens are on special, buy several, cut them up 
and package the component parts in serving size portions for the freezer. Buy a 
couple of first-cut blade chucks when they're on sale. Even if you don't have 
the time or inclination for a pot roast, there are all kinds of different meals 
to be made from a chuck roast if you'll do a little cutting up in the kitchen. 
You can make steaks, stew, stir-fry meat or ground chuck for all kinds of 
recipes from a couple of inexpensive chuck roasts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If the Price Is Right 
</P>
<P>
A leg of lamb on special may be far more than you need for one meal, but if the 
price is right, don't pass it by -- buy it. Ring the bell and ask the butcher 
to bone it for you, then separate the individual muscles to make smaller 
roasts, chops, cutlets or stew meat, all of which will likely cost less than 
similar cuts in the same meat case. 
</P>
<P>
The meat counter is not the only place in the store where it pays to think big. 
Things like rice, barley, macaroni and spaghetti keep almost forever and they 
are always less expensive per pound if you buy the larger package. You can 
sometimes get staples at half price if you buy big. The people who pay most for 
what they buy are those who shop one meal at a time for only one or two people. 
Even if you are cooking for only one or two, you can save money if you plan 
ahead and buy for the freezer rather than waiting till the last minute and 
buying something "quick" from the frozen food case at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, check out the "outer limits." The outside perimeter of most 
supermarkets is where you will find most of the unprocessed foods from the four 
basic food groups -- dairy, meat and other protein, breads, and fruits and 
vegetables. Try shopping the outer limits and spending as little time as 
possible in the "inner zone." In my opinion, not only will you save money but 
you will feed your family more wholesome, nutritious meals. The "inner zone" is 
where you will find all those high-fat, high-sugar fun foods that your body as 
well as your budget can well do without.

YOU ASKED ABOUT : TOMATOES IN CANS THAT HAVE RUSTED STILL SAFE TO EAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We have several cans of tomatoes that have become rusted on both ends 
-- not swollen, but rusted. Apparently, my storing them in a bath house was not 
a great idea. I was going to toss them out, but my husband insisted that I 
write to you because he and a neighbor think the contents are still safe to 
use. Would appreciate your help. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We checked with the Canned Food Information Council in Chicago and 
learned they agree with your husband and neighbor. As long as there is no 
damage to the seams and no leakage from the cans, the ingredients should still 
be safe to consume. In the future, however, it would be best to store canned 
goods in a place with less humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do the new reduced-cholesterol eggs react the same as regular eggs in 
baking? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, according to Helen Bauch, Food Technologist for the California Egg 
Commission in Upland, the reduced-cholesterol eggs are used exactly the same as 
regular eggs. 
</P>
<P>
For those unfamiliar with the reduced-cholesterol eggs, Rosemary Farm, a Santa 
Maria-based firm has achieved a 50% reduction in the cholesterol content of 
eggs by providing hens a specially designed feed. The eggs contain 
approximately 125 milligrams per egg and are priced about 60 cents more per 
dozen, according to an Oct. 25 article in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know how to make candied kumquats like you see at Christmas 
in fruit packs. I have a tree that is loaded with the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
A: This recipe is adapted from "Fancy Pantry" (Workman Publishing: 1986) by 
Helen Witty. 
</P>
<P>
CANDIED KUMQUATS 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds bright-skinned, firm kumquats 
</P>
<P>
5 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
Superfine sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
Rinse kumquats and remove any stems. If skins have any small rusty spots, scrub 
with small stiff brush to remove as much of discoloration as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Place kumquats in saucepan and add enough cold water to cover fruit by 1 inch. 
Bring to boil, partially cover pan, and simmer fruit 10 minutes. Drain kumquats 
in colander. 
</P>
<P>
In same saucepan, combine sugar and water and bring to boil. Boil syrup 5 
minutes, then add well-drained kumquats. Bring fruit just to boil over 
medium-high heat, then lower heat and simmer kumquats, uncovered, 10 minutes. 
Pour fruit and syrup into shallow bowl and let stand overnight, covered with 
cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Return kumquats and syrup to saucepan, bring to boil and simmer 20 minutes, or 
until fruit is translucent and tender when tested with cake tester or thin 
skewer. If syrup should become very thick and may scorch before fruit is done, 
add small amount boiling water and continue cooking. 
</P>
<P>
When kumquats are tender, remove pan from heat and cool fruit in syrup. Lift 
kumquats from syrup one at a time and arrange on wire rack set over baking 
sheet. Let drain and dry at room temperature until kumquats are no longer 
sticky to touch, from 1 to 2 hours to overnight, depending on level of 
humidity. 
</P>
<P>
If weather is damp and fruit dries slowly, set rack in oven set at lowest or 
keep warm temperature and leave, with oven door ajar, until no longer sticky. 
Roll kumquats in superfine sugar and store in airtight container at room 
temperature. Roll again in superfine sugar just before serving. Makes 2 pounds.

THE RICH CULINARY TRADITION OF PARMESAN CHEESE SPANS 7 CENTURIES; 
</P>
<P>
'CHEESE DETECTIVE' CONSORTIUM SAFEGUARDS ITS AGES-OLD REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW GUMBEL, Reuter 
</P>

<P>
BAGANZOLINO, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For its makers, Parmesan cheese is not just something to grate and sprinkle 
over pasta. 
</P>
<P>
It is rooted in folklore spanning seven centuries and the dairy farmers around 
Parma in northern Italy who make it do not take kindly to imitations 
masquerading as the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
For several years their consortium has been policing cheese sellers in Italy, 
but with the approach of a unified European market in 1992 they are now hoping 
to extend their tough rules to the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
A small squad of consortium "cheese detectives" stakes out shops, street 
markets and restaurants, mostly in Italy but also in France and Switzerland 
where the Parmesan name is guaranteed under bilateral agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"The consortium has limited means so we depend mostly on food industry 
officials and consumers to tell us about infringements. But we also use four to 
six of our employees to make inspections," consortium president Giampaolo Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under an Italian law passed in the 1950s cheese can carry the Parmesan name 
only if it is made according to a 700-year-old method in a small area defined 
by natural boundaries including the Po River. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Grana, a similar cheese in taste and texture produced north of the Po, 
Parmesan contains no artificial additives and is made entirely by hand. It also 
costs up to 25% more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Definitely Not the Real Thing 
</P>
<P>
Mora, a lawyer and a Christian Democrat senator, said his organization was 
fighting several small companies in the courts. "There are many retailers 
selling what they call Parmesan which is definitely not the real thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora and representatives of five other EC countries thrashed out the text of an 
agreement defining the cheese in Paris and he said he was lobbying for its 
extension to other member nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Italians know Parmesan when they see it, but foreigners are more easily taken 
in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Parma at the Baganzolino cooperative, one of 930 farms authorized 
to produce Parmesan, you begin to appreciate the cheese's near-mystical 
prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Across the flat Po Valley plains, which in winter are almost permanently 
shrouded in low mist, cows eat only fresh grass or hay. Other feed lowers the 
quality of their milk and affects Parmesan's golden-yellow hue. 
</P>
<P>
Milk is left in metal basins overnight and then skimmed. After being heated in 
a copper vat for an hour, a solid mass forms which is drawn out with a 
long-handled metal sieve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Natural Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
While Grana manufacturers use an artificial setting agent at this stage, 
Parmesan makers just add rennet, a coagulant found in calves' stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
The 260 gallons of milk in each vat reduce to just two big cheeses, which are 
pressed out in a circular wooden mold about 18 inches in diameter and left to 
solidify. 
</P>
<P>
The cheese is then immersed for a month in salt solution and stencilled with 
the Parmesan stamp and a code number to identify the farm which made it. 
</P>
<P>
At Baganzolino cheeses are stored on stacks 21 shelves high like books in a 
library. During the two years it takes them to mature they are regularly turned 
and brushed to avoid the build-up of mold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Methods 
</P>
<P>
The master cheese maker will use a metal hammer to test each cheese for the 
right sound and extract samples with a spiral hook for chemical analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"Making Parmesan is a ritual," Mora said. "The only thing which has changed in 
700 years is that the milk is heated by gas instead of wood." 
</P>
<P>
It is also big business. The consortium has a turnover of $950 million each 
year, producing two and a half million cheeses. It exports only 6% of its 
output, but Mora said the European market was expanding fast. 
</P>
<P>
Whether because of the geographical location or the devoted precision with 
which the farmers make the cheese, it seems that Parmesan is indeed impossible 
to imitate elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said a farm in Normandy tried making it with local milk following the 
traditional method but failed to reproduce the fragrance and rich crumbly 
texture which make Parmesan as delicious eaten as a dessert cheese as when 
grated on spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
"Before being a great cheese it is art, life, an almost sacred symbol of 
peasant culture," the consortium's director, Luigi Verrini, has written. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring that culture abroad defeated even Thomas Jefferson, who wanted to 
start making the cheese in the newly independent United States 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After he became President in 1801, Jefferson wrote to an Italian friend: "You 
were right, it's better to leave Parmesan making to the people who know what 
they are doing."

FPPC INVESTIGATING HAWTHORNE'S VOTES; 
</P>
<P>
CALTRANS CHAIRMAN HAD VOWED TO ABSTAIN ON PROJECTS INVOLVING HIS EQUIPMENT FIRM 
</P>

<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether a 
prominent San Diego County businessman has violated state conflict-of-interest 
laws by voting to approve millions of dollars of construction projects as a 
member of the California Transportation Commission, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
J. Thomas Hawthorne of Escondido, the exclusive dealer of Caterpillar heavy 
equipment in San Diego, pledged almost three years ago to abstain on 
Transportation Commission votes involving San Diego County after it was 
reported that the builders of almost every local highway project buy or rent 
equipment from his company. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hawthorne has voted for 52 area projects worth $164 million, 
according to a report prepared for the state Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC probe could endanger Hawthorne's seat on the commission, to which he 
has been renominated for a second four-year term by Gov. George Deukmejian. He 
is now chairman of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday that he 
will delay a scheduled Senate floor vote on Hawthorne's appointment while the 
FPPC reviews the matter. If the Senate does not act by Feb. 1, Hawthorne will 
lose his seat on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checking With Contractors 
</P>
<P>
A Senate source said the FPPC has asked the Transportation Commission for a 
list of construction contracts awarded on the 52 San Diego projects for which 
Hawthorne voted. FPPC investigators will then check with the contractors to 
determine how much of that business went to Hawthorne's firm, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hawthorne nor the FPPC's spokeswoman could be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 4 appearance before the Senate Rules Committee, Hawthorne said his 
votes were not a conflict of interest because San Diego County has received 
less highway money than legally allowed under the Legislature's formula for the 
allocation of state funds. He said his votes did not bring the county any more 
money than it was already entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
After The Times disclosed Hawthorne's possible conflict in 1985, the FPPC 
reviewed his votes and determined that customers of his business had received 
90% of the $55.6 million worth of projects approved for San Diego County during 
Hawthorne's first 18 months on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The watchdog agency refrained from fining Hawthorne for a conflict of interest 
but warned him not to vote on projects that could benefit his business. It was 
then that Hawthorne pledged to abstain. 
</P>
<P>
"When jobs are let in this area, I'm going to have to abstain from voting on 
them," he told The Times.

MIGRANTS TEAR DOWN HUTS AS EVICTION NEARS

Rafael Martinez hurried to sell his home of three years Tuesday, quickly 
agreeing to the buyer's price -- 20 cents a kilo for the wood and scrap metal 
and $3 each for the two mattresses inside. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Martinez earned a tidy $230 from the sale of his home, one of almost a 
hundred plywood hooches in this migrant's camp in the coastal town of 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is enough to get me back to Tijuana and take care of me for a couple of 
weeks," Martinez said. "I've had it. I could deal with the Border Patrol. But 
how did the health department do this to us?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the about 125 remaining inhabitants of the Valle Verde squatters' camp 
are asking the same question. The camp's residents include migrants from Mexico 
and several other Latin American countries, many of whom have qualified for the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service's year-old amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Verde was founded more than a decade ago, when the first residents 
erected plywood shanties and camouflaged them on the chaparral-covered 
hillsides across the road from affluent La Costa. The camp sits on El Camino 
Real, near Olivenhain Road, sprawled across a couple of hundred acres of prime 
coastal property, less than a mile from Carlsbad State Beach and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Before development began to encroach, Valle Verde was one of many migrant 
worker camps spread across San Diego County's isolated northern area, close to 
the nurseries and agricultural fields where thousands of aliens have been 
traditionally employed. Over the years, the workers have lived through frequent 
raids by Border Patrol agents, who were seen as more of a nuisance than a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints by Residents 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego County Health Services Department has accomplished in the 
last six months what the Border Patrol had been unable to do in years. Last 
summer, reacting to many complaints from area residents of trash, noise and the 
growth of the primitive camp, county health officials declared Valle Verde a 
health hazard and ordered the property owners -- the wealthy Texas Hunt 
brothers -- to abate the site. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, after the abatement plan was approved by the California 
Coastal Commission, the property owners posted notices in Spanish and English 
throughout the camp telling the migrants that they had until Feb. 1 to leave. 
The cleanup was left to the supervision of the leaseholder of the property, 
Frank Wright &amp; Sons, a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl (Ben) Benstead, who is overseeing the cleanup for the leaseholder, and 
Wright came up with a plan to pay the migrants for razing the camp. The men are 
paying 20 cents a kilo (equivalent to 2.2 pounds) for wood and scrap metal, $3 
per mattress and 50 cents for each plastic bag filled with trash. 
</P>
<P>
Benstead tried to stop the evictions, apologized to the migrants in a letter 
and called them "good neighbors." He does not try to hide his bitterness over 
the eviction. "I have no faith in human nature anymore. . . . I'm kind of 
emotionally spent over this," said Benstead. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday afternoon, the second day of the program, migrants had been paid 
more than $1,000 for the scrap. The debris brought down from the hills by the 
migrants had filled two 40-cubic-yard trash bins. Silvino Ruiz, one of 
Benstead's helpers, was towing a portable scale around, weighing and recording 
the loads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Where Do We Go?' 
</P>
<P>
Although county officials have succeeded in uprooting the migrants, they have 
failed in attempts to find them housing. In a much-publicized move, county 
officials announced in November that attempts would be made to find subsidized 
housing for the about 12 families with children who live at Valle Verde. As of 
Wednesday, none of the families had found housing. 
</P>
<P>
Several migrants said that they will simply move to another camp farther north, 
near Palomar Airport. A large number said they will wait until Feb. 1, when the 
leaseholder will stop paying for scrap and trash and begin tearing down the 
camp, and then decide where to go. Others, emboldened by their legal status, 
talked about mounting a protest. 
</P>
<P>
But the question heard over and over in the camp was, "Where do we go from 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why are the authorities doing this to us? We have no place to go. Most of us 
will just find another hillside or canyon to live," said a man called Tiburon. 
"I don't understand gringos. In 1985, when I almost drowned at Carlsbad Beach, 
they used a helicopter to save me. Now they're telling me to get out of the 
only house I have. Why did they save me?"

VICTIMS OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL SHOOTING ARE FORCED TO COPE AGAIN 10 YEARS LATER 
</P>

Christy Buell was "shocked, saddened, horrified" by the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, a killer walked onto a schoolyard in Stockton and opened fire on 
children, killing five and wounding 29 with bursts from a semiautomatic rifle. 
A teacher was also wounded in the assault, which lasted only three to four 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For Buell, the news was a grim reminder, an ugly blast of history repeating 
itself. She was one of eight children wounded Jan. 29, 1979 -- almost exactly a 
decade ago -- when teen-age sniper Brenda Spencer opened fire on schoolchildren 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the creepy flashback for Buell was learning that the school in Stockton 
bears the same name as the one in San Diego -- Cleveland Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared for those people," Buell said Wednesday, adding that she was 
"shaking" just in having to discuss the incident in an interview. "I felt 
really sorry for them, because I know exactly what they're feeling . . . . I 
went through the same terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
Buell, 19, was then a 9-year-old fourth-grader still coping with the death of 
her mother, who lost the battle to leukemia when her daughter was 2. Buell said 
the grief her father felt -- losing a wife, almost losing a daughter -- was 
unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Buell now works at a day-care center not far from where the shootings occurred. 
Her work with children has made her wonder all the more why someone would ever 
want to harm them. Buell was shot twice by Spencer -- in the abdomen and in the 
lower back. She was hospitalized for a month and spent 18 months recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other way to say it," she said with a quivering voice. "I'll just 
never get over it." 
</P>
<P>
She suffers no physical repercussions, only the psychological fallout, which 
she compared to a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome, not unlike that 
experienced by some veterans of the Vietnam War. The same can be said not only 
by victims but also their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Selvig is an attorney, a family law specialist in San Diego. His daughter, 
Monica, now 18, was shot in the stomach, the bullet exiting her back close to 
the spine. She suffers no lasting physical effects, although Selvig asked that 
Monica not be interviewed; he would speak for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to deny the trauma," he said. "Even before yesterday (Tuesday), 
the incident was constantly on the minds of the family. We haven't been able to 
shake it. I heard Michael Mantell (a San Diego psychologist) interviewed on 
radio this morning, and he pointed out something really beneficial. He said 
families must emphasize the positive at a time like this. I have to say it 
improved our family's relationships, drew us closer together. It had to. It 
also impressed upon us how fragile our 
</P>
<P>
lives really are. It woke us up to our own mortality." 
</P>
<P>
Selvig said the school's bearing the same name carried an eerie afterglow that 
was almost indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Happening All Over' 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange, but that alone made it seem the nightmare was happening all over 
again," he said. "It made our incident close and all too frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Selvig sees as one of the saddest tragedies Monica's losing of an illusion. 
Much like children in Belfast or Beirut, he said, those wounded at Cleveland 
Elementary in San Diego 10 years ago were shocked into the world of adult 
reality without being allowed to make the transition gradually. 
</P>
<P>
"A child has the right to grow up feeling that they're out of harm's way," 
Selvig said. "They have a right to a childlike aura of invincibility. Brenda 
Spencer took that away from Monica forever." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Robles, 20, suffered a gunshot wound to the side that day in San Diego. 
Doctors marveled that the bullet that struck Robles passed right through her -- 
almost hitting her kidneys but striking no major organs and leaving her with 
only a minor injury. 
</P>
<P>
The psychological wound was greater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Terribly Upsetting' 
</P>
<P>
"The Stockton thing was terribly upsetting and disturbing," she said. "I was 
very upset by the date being so close to the 10th anniversary of our shooting 
and the name of the school being the same." 
</P>
<P>
For a decade, Robles has been traumatized by news accounts of snipers or 
gun-wielding psychopaths walking into a public place and opening fire. She 
wrestles with the feelings for days, and, just when it seems she's over it, she 
hears about a Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Thoughts seem to leap out of nowhere that tear at her spirit and toy with her 
equilibrium. She actually thinks about Brenda Spencer from time to time, 
wondering if the woman is safely locked up -- she is, in the California 
Institution for Women in Frontera -- and whether she will ever return to do 
Robles harm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informing Friends 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, she has the strange task of informing a new friend that 
once, on a school ground in San Diego, she was shot in an incident that made 
the national news. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, and they just look at me stunned," Robles said. "Their reaction 
is one of total disbelief. They say, 'No way, Julie.' They just can't believe 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For Christy Buell, the saddest memory is that two men she knew -- good men -- 
were slain that day. Spencer murdered Principal Burton Wragg and custodian 
Michael Suchar. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss of two men that put their lives in danger to save children . . . 
that's the hardest part for me," Buell said, "the part no one will ever undo."

CARLSBAD STREET PLAN HAS COMPETITIVE EDGE

<P>
Carlsbad business and civic leaders, hoping that a revitalized downtown will 
spur new business ventures and attract consumers, have pledged their support 
for a project that is expected to give the city's prominent thoroughfares a new 
look. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday authorized local redevelopment officials to solicit 
bids from contractors who will give a face lift to the downtown's two major 
streets, Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue, said John Cahill, the city's 
municipal projects manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlsbad Redevelopment Agency is spearheading the $8-million "streetscape 
project," which includes plans to widen and rebuild streets, construct a 
sculpture park, build a pedestrian mall and install fountains and decorative 
paving, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Destination Spot' 
</P>
<P>
Project advocates say the improvements will not only enhance the coastal city's 
appearance but establish the city as a "destination spot" and a retail center 
capable of competing with North County's growing number of shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Council members unanimously approved the $1.8-million second stage of the 
project at Tuesday's meeting. The improvements are to be made in five stages, 
with completion scheduled for early 1991, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision allows the city to solicit bids from contractors to begin the 
second stage, which calls for the rebuilding of Carlsbad Boulevard, from Walnut 
Street to Buena Vista Lagoon. The money allocated in the second phase will also 
be used to improve Elm Avenue, from Ocean Street to Washington Street. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Redevelopment Agency was established in 1981, one of its long-term 
goals was to improve and revitalize the core 
</P>
<P>
area along Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue," said Cahill, who will be 
responsible for overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been interested in improving the area to promote tourism and the 
business area and establish effective traffic and pedestrian circulation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which was approved in concept last February by the council, calls 
for the rebuilding and expansion of Elm Avenue from two lanes to four from Pio 
Pico Drive to the ocean. It also calls for the rebuilding of Carlsbad Boulevard 
from its northern end to Ocean Street. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaped medians are planned for both thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architectural Award 
</P>
<P>
The project, which will also adorn streets with several art projects, received 
a landscaping award in December from the American Society of Landscape 
Architects, said Chris Salomone, the city's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
Such improvements will result in a dramatic change from the city's appearance 
in the late 1960s and early '70s, when it was tarnished with many run-down 
areas, according to Mayor Bud Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
When the redevelopment agency was established in 1981, it was charged with 
removing those decaying structures by coordinating the efforts of city 
officials, merchants and residents, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the streetscape project developed from simultaneous efforts to 
enhance the city's image by creating a village environment and bolstering its 
economic position, Salomone said. 
</P>
<P>
"The downtown area was incredibly impacted by the regional mall," he said. "We 
knew we couldn't compete head-to-head against the malls that have these big 
anchor stores. So we decided to persuade people to spend money here by creating 
a quaint, market-like atmosphere with specialty-type retail stores." 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project was, in essence, approved when the City Council 
blessed plans by developers to construct Village Faire, a 3.7-acre retail 
center at the intersection of Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed to Incorporate Ideas 
</P>
<P>
Salomone said the developers have agreed to incorporate the city's streetscape 
plans into their plans for the retail center. The city will contribute about 
$400,000 to the first stage of the project, which is expected to begin in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The other stages of the project include: 
</P>
<P>
* A $500,000 outdoor sculpture park, scheduled for construction this fall at 
Ocean Street and Carlsbad Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Improvements along Elm Avenue, from Washington Street to Pio Pico Drive, 
during the summer of 1990. This fourth stage is expected to cost at least $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Three downtown parking lots to be built this summer at a cost of $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think it's a great idea to spruce up the village area," said 
Scott Little, president of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce. "We're always 
concerned about the tourism factor, and this will make Carlsbad a destination 
spot. But I think this will do a lot to attract local residents to the area, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
To bring even more dollars to Carlsbad, redevelopment officials have decided to 
rename Elm Avenue, calling it Carlsbad Village Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"The name change was a blatant economic move," Salomone said. "That sign will 
be out on Interstate 5, and we're hoping that people will say, 'Hey, there's a 
village here, let's go check it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Elm Avenue is a generic name," Salomone said. "But Carlsbad Village Drive . . 
. that will attract people off I-5 and bring them into Carlsbad."

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;

<P>
 ANIMAL SANCTUARY MAY BE ELIMINATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report to the Los Angeles County Small Craft Harbor Commission recommends 
elimination of a makeshift sanctuary for abandoned bunnies, baby chicks and 
ducklings in a Marina del Rey flood control basin. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Mark Nathanson, who conducted a public hearing on the matter in 
October, said in the report that the commission should remove the animals from 
the 10.5-acre Oxford Flood Control Basin. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said that people tired of bunnies, baby chicks and ducklings 
that were given as gifts on Christmas and Easter began dumping the creatures in 
the basin about 10 years ago. In 1982, volunteers began feeding and caring for 
the abandoned birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Some nearby residents, complaining of noise and odors, have asked county 
officials to remove the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will consider the matter on Monday.

HOSPITAL IN CHULA VISTA TO BECOME PART OF SHARP NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF and CHRIS KRAUL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community Hospital of Chula Vista announced Wednesday that it will become a 
part of the Sharp HealthCare network -- an affiliation that hospital 
administrators say will allow them to expand in anticipation of a future 
population boom in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no outright purchase of the hospital by Sharp," said Community 
Hospital spokeswoman Imozelle McVeigh. "We are becoming a member of the Sharp 
health care system." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a Community Hospital source who declined to be named, the 
agreement calls for Sharp HealthCare -- also known as the San Diego Hospital 
Assn. -- to ultimately take ownership of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital Debt Targeted 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, hospital administrators would say only that Sharp HealthCare and 
the hospital will work together to restructure the facility's existing bond 
indebtedness. The outstanding indebtedness remaining from the construction of 
the main hospital in 1975 and the more recent construction of a convalescent 
center is between $10 million and $15 million, McVeigh said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board has been looking at the whole idea of a corporate affiliation for 
about a year," she said. "We could have done some expansion on our own, but 
nothing of this magnitude. We're a small community hospital and simply don't 
have those financial resources." 
</P>
<P>
An 85-bed expansion is already in the planning stage for the 45-year-old 
hospital, which has been in its present location on Medical Center Court in 
Chula Vista since 1975. There are 131 beds in the main hospital, plus 98 beds 
in the adjacent Birch Patrick Convalescent Center, which opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The planned 90,000-square-foot expansion will include a 23-bed maternity unit, 
which is seen as a key move to providing adequate service to the growing number 
of young families in the eastern Chula Vista and Otay Mesa areas, McVeigh said. 
In addition, an 8-bed surgical intensive care unit, a 54-bed medical-surgical 
floor and expanded space for radiology, lab and emergency departments are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
McVeigh said the hospital will retain its "local identity" despite the 
acquisition by Sharp. According to the terms of the agreement, Community 
Hospital will keep its existing management staff and board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Community Hospital officials said the decision to join Sharp was not prompted 
by financial troubles, and they cited higher-than-average occupancy rates in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong Financial Position' 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a strong financial position today, and we expect to be in a strong 
financial position in the future," Community Hospital executive director Robert 
D. Hansen said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This move is a way for us to join with Sharp to prepare for the future and 
expand our services to meet the growing needs of the South Bay community," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter K. Ellsworth, president and chief executive officer of Sharp HealthCare, 
also issued a prepared statement: "In our rapidly changing, competitive health 
care environment, the joining of like-minded institutions is important in 
allowing them to do the very best for the communities they serve." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp HealthCare's wholly-owned subsidiaries include Sharp Memorial Hospital, 
Sharp Cabrillo Hospital, two Sharp Senior HealthCare centers, nine Sharp 
Rees-Stealy medical centers, two convalescent hospitals and a preventive 
medicine center. 
</P>
<P>
The system boasts San Diego's only state-approved heart transplant center, the 
first local open-heart surgery center and the only facility on the West Coast 
authorized to give patients artificial hearts. 
</P>
<P>
But the health network -- along with other hospitals in the county -- has 
recently run into financial difficulties. Last July, Sharp laid off 44 of its 
2,200 employees. The cutback was brought about in part by lower payment rates 
from both private insurers and government programs such as Medicare and 
Medi-Cal, hospital administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sharp HealthCare officials say their financial woes are no worse than 
other hospitals in the county, most of which have also been stung by lower 
insurance payments.

HUDSON FEARED DISCOVERY BY NANCY REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former bartender who is suing Rock Hudson's estate testified Wednesday that 
the actor once refused to take him to a state dinner at the White House because 
he was afraid First Lady Nancy Reagan would realize he was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that Nancy Reagan would figure out our relationship because she was a 
very bright woman and he was embarrassed," Marc Christian said under 
cross-examination by Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for Hudson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, in his third day on the stand in the Los Angeles Superior Court 
trial, said he had sex with Hudson about 160 times between June, 1984, when 
Hudson learned he had AIDS, and February, 1985, when Christian said he learned 
of the actor's illness from a television newscast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Asked 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Mills if he would have stopped having sex with Hudson if he had known 
the actor had AIDS, Christian answered, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Christian is suing Hudson's estate, two doctors and Mark Miller, the actor's 
personal secretary, for $14 million, charging that they conspired to conceal 
that Hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
In a countersuit, estate attorneys claim that Christian was a prostitute who 
blackmailed the former leading man by threatening to expose Hudson's 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson died in 1985 of complications from AIDS at the age of 59. 
</P>
<P>
Christian has tested negative for the AIDS virus, but under questioning from 
Mills he noted, "There is no test to tell if AIDS is dormant. If there were, 
there'd be a lot of relieved people." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony was marked by sharp exchanges between Mills and Christian's 
attorney, Harold Rhoden, centering on the admissibility of various depositions 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, after Mills had taken a document from Rhoden to show Christian, 
Rhoden exploded: "Counsel, you grab something from me gently or don't grab it 
at all. Don't grab anything from me again." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert also admonished Mills and Miller for 
"snickering" during Christian's testimony. The admonishment came after 
Christian, contradicting testimony he gave last week, said one of his sexual 
encounters with Hudson was witnessed by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Christian said the friend accidentally saw Christian and Hudson having sex and 
volunteered the information after his earlier testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what he saw, and he said, 'You weren't playing Scrabble,' " 
Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, who met Hudson in 1982 at a fund-raiser for senatorial candidate and 
author Gore Vidal, has testified that he had sex with Hudson three to five 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that because news of Hudson's illness was kept from him, his 
chances of being infected by the actor were greatly increased.

DOTTED LINE LEADS D.A.S INTO TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in Contract Law 101 -- maybe in the first hour of the first session 
-- students are advised: Don't sign a contract unless you've read it -- much 
less the signature page of a contract if there's no contract attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys, of course, know this. 
</P>
<P>
Well, most attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The Deputy District Attorney Assn., the employee bargaining group that 
represents virtually all of the county's 200 prosecutors, made that very error 
when signing, in December, 1986, what it assumed would be the terms of a salary 
and benefits contract between its members and San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
What the deputy district attorneys' negotiators -- attorneys themselves -- 
signed was the signature page of a contract, even though the contract itself 
was not attached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Trusted Them' 
</P>
<P>
"We trusted them," Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Rooten said of the negotiators who, 
he said, were to put the verbal terms of the contract into writing and later 
attach the document to the pre-signed signature page. "We agreed in principle 
on the language. The county (negotiators) were to prepare the final document." 
</P>
<P>
Signing what was essentially a blank page, Rooten said, was done to meet 
deadlines so the contract could be approved by the County Board of Supervisors 
in time to implement a pay raise. The contract was to cover the period from 
June, 1986, to December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the final, written contract was returned to the Deputy District 
Attorney Assn., the attorneys cried foul, claiming that some of the terms 
didn't reflect what they thought were the terms to which they verbally agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Among other issues, the prosecutors thought they and the county had agreed to 
return to the bargaining table in 1987 to negotiate salaries for 1988; the 
final version, as written by county negotiators, called for the Board of 
Supervisors to unilaterally set the salary table, based on a survey of what 
other prosecutors are paid in California. Other differences involved health 
benefits and the retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors sued the county for declaratory relief, asking that the written 
contract be rewritten to better reflect what were believed to be the verbal 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruled for Prosecutors 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit finally went to trial last week, and Superior Court Judge James 
Milliken ruled for the prosecutors after three days of testimony by ordering 
certain parts of the contract rewritten -- allowing, among other things, for 
the two sides to negotiate salaries retroactively for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The county counsel's office, acting as the attorney for the county's 
negotiators, sees the overall issue somewhat differently. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Laurel Gallaher-Tobar said a draft of the contract was 
available when the deputy district attorneys signed the blank signature page 
memorializing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We argued to the judge that the D.A. association should be held to the 
contract, since they had an opportunity to see it," she said. "I thought that 
was a major issue. The court didn't agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
So it's back to the negotiating table to resolve issues of salary raises and 
health benefits that remained unresolved during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations on a 1989 contract are already at an impasse, and Judge 
Milliken told both sides he will be available for any more problems. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can bet," Rooten said, "we won't be signing any blank signature pages 
this time."

<P>
An innovative stolen car tracking system that state legislators refused to 
approve for Los Angeles last year could be in place by the end of the year 
under a plan approved by city police commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Commission recommended Tuesday that the City Council 
agree to a proposed contract under which LoJack Corp. would lease patented, 
high-tech equipment to the city for five years at no charge and then transfer 
ownership to the city, officials said. The agreement would amount to a gift of 
the $1.4-million system to the city. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the council, any Los Angeles driver could buy and install a $600 
transmitter that could be tracked by police computers if the vehicle were 
stolen. Police helicopters and about 300 patrol cars would be equipped with the 
small tracking computers. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which police officials said could be expanded statewide, is modeled 
after one begun in Massachusetts in 1986. That system has led to recovery of 
98% of LoJack-equipped cars in an average of 90 minutes, Massachusetts state 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promise to Buyers 
</P>
<P>
LoJack sells transmitters to Massachusetts drivers with a promise that the cost 
will be refunded if the car is stolen and not recovered within 24 hours. As of 
August, 12,000 cars were participating in that statewide system. 
</P>
<P>
A California bill last year that would have allocated $1 million to establish a 
Stolen Car Recovery Network pilot program in Los Angeles County was dropped 
amid criticism that it was tailor-made to give LoJack, of Braintree, Mass., a 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), was dropped after an intense 
lobbying effort by other car security companies. None of those companies has 
similar technology but they say they could develop similar equipment in less 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Commission's 5-0 vote prompted at least one of those competitors to 
cry foul Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they are trying to go through the back door with what they 
couldn't go through the front door with," said Carolyn Drori, an attorney 
representing Clifford Electronics, a Chatsworth firm that was one of several 
auto security companies that opposed the LoJack proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Drori said the opponents fear that establishing the LoJack system will lock 
them out. "We don't want to stop the LAPD if they think this is an important 
tool," Drori said. "But let's make sure it is the best system and an open 
system." 
</P>
<P>
LoJack officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed LoJack contract is non-exclusive, meaning the Police Department 
could use any equipment developed by competing firms that works better or could 
support LoJack equipment, said Sgt. Jeff Hulet, the department's technical 
coordinator of the tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the LoJack equipment is patented, the radio frequency used in the 
system is a public frequency. This might allow LoJack competitors to develop 
equipment for the system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Hulet said, LoJack would enter into the contract with the 
city, which would then be empowered to share the equipment with the Sheriff's 
Department. Computer bases for the system would likely be located at both 
departments and at the state Department of Justice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hulet said there are no regulations preventing the city from accepting the free 
equipment if the council decides it is in the city's best interest. Because it 
is free, there is no need to put the contract out for competitive bidding, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moot point," Hulet said. "How do you propose getting it for better than 
free?" 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to consider the proposal in four to six weeks, 
said Officer Bill Farrar of the Police Department's evaluation unit, which 
began studying the system nearly two years ago.

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE MAY DISMISS 2 SCHOOL FUNDING SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday appeared to be leaning toward 
dismissing two lawsuits filed by crowded Santa Clarita Valley school districts 
to block two housing developments until funding is found to build new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt J. Lewin said he would consider Los Angeles County's motion to drop 
the suits. "In my opinion, what this is really all about is the imposition of 
fees" on developers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin called the lawsuits an attempt to circumvent a state law on school 
financing. An appellate court last month held that the law sets limits of $1.50 
per square foot on the amount school districts can charge housing developers 
for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schools Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wiles, attorney for the William S. Hart and Saugus school districts, 
argued that the lawsuits are not asking the county to impose fees to pay for 
schools and, as such, should not be tied to the appellate court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The school districts simply are asking that the projects, which include more 
than 3,000 homes, apartments and condominiums, be postponed until funding is 
obtained, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the developments were approved without considering schools, Wiles said, 
the districts maintain that the housing projects do not comply with a 
sophisticated development-monitoring system adopted by the county in 1987. The 
system, or the DMS, was the result of a 12-year lawsuit brought by slow-growth 
groups against the county. 
</P>
<P>
The DMS prohibits the county from approving residential projects that will 
overburden the school system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Phillips, a county attorney, argued that the state school financing 
law, enacted in 1987, clearly preempts imposition of fees by the county on 
developers to pay for school construction under the DMS. County Counsel Dewitt 
W. Clinton agreed in an opinion issued earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Seek Transfer 
</P>
<P>
Wiles said she will ask that the case be transferred to Judge Norman L. 
Epstein, who presided over the last two years of the DMS lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said after the hearing that to remove the case from Lewin's court 
would amount to "a slap in the face of Judge Lewin." Lewin, however, said he 
"would be happy to have Judge Epstein" hear the lawsuit if the school districts 
wish. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said she doubts that the county would attempt to block the school 
districts' efforts to have the case transferred to Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised that a decision was not rendered" Wednesday, said Clyde 
Smyth, superintendent of the Hart district. "It's an incredibly complicated 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
The three high schools in that district will be over capacity by a total of 
almost 2,000 students by 1992, Smyth said. He added that based on county 
population projections for the year 2010 in the fast-growing valley, the five 
area school districts will need $400 million to allow doubling their student 
enrollment to more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
The valley's population is expected to increase from its current 120,000 to an 
estimated 270,000 by 2010 because of rapid housing construction.

PROJECT CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 Agoura area residents have told developers that a proposed 474-acre 
commercial and residential project is too dense and not classy enough for their 
semi-rural community. 
</P>
<P>
Wickliff &amp; Co. and the Pulte Home Corp. want to build 338 housing units and 
261,700 square feet of commercial space, including a discount retail store, 
near Agoura and Kanan roads. They are calling the proposal the Agoura Canyon 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In a town hall-style meeting in Agoura Hills punctuated by shouting Tuesday 
night, residents said the proposal would clog traffic on already busy roads. 
The proposal includes 126 condominiums, which some residents said would be out 
of character with the community of large estate homes to the south. Others 
objected to the discount store. 
</P>
<P>
The project is "low-end rather than upper-end," resident Michael Genthe said. 
"You're proposing such a non-consistent development compared to what's there 
today." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need it, and we don't want it," resident Gary Epper said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers' representatives defended the proposal, saying that the discount 
store would serve the community and that the condominiums would satisfy 
requirements for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not proposing a cheap-production thing," said Robert W. Smith, vice 
president of Pulte Home. "These can be fairly expensive things that will add to 
the value of the community." The project would include 80 estate-sized houses 
on lots averaging two acres. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the developers said, the city of Agoura Hills would receive $3.3 
million in fees for traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The city could use that money to pay for new on- and off-ramps to the eastbound 
Ventura Freeway at Kanan Road, estimated to cost $2.9 million, City Manager 
David N. Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the proposed project straddles the southern border of Agoura Hills, 
with the area proposed for houses and condominiums in unincorporated Los 
Angeles County territory. 
</P>
<P>
If the city were to annex the unincorporated area, Wickliff and Pulte would 
have to seek zoning changes to permit the housing density they are proposing, 
Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
Project officials said they did not know how much housing is allowed under the 
county plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Anderson, Wickliff vice president, promised to hold another meeting 
in about a month to respond to those and other questions, such as the issue of 
possible flooding from Medea Creek.

DISCO OPERATOR GETS PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The would-be operator of a teen-age disco was given a suspended three-year 
sentence and placed on probation after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine in 
his office at the Distillery West. 
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions of Richard Vander's probation are that he enter a 
drug-treatment program and pay a fine of $200. He was sentenced Tuesday by 
Vista Superior Court Judge Richard Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
Vander, 37, had operated the Solana Beach nightclub for adults and was seeking 
to reestablish it as an alcohol-free teen-age club when he was arrested in 
November, 1987. The club remains vacant. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for his guilty plea to possession of cocaine, prosecutors dropped 
their charge that he was an ex-felon illegally in possession of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest came when sheriff's detectives, saying they wanted to discuss using 
Vander as an informant, met with him in his office and detected what they 
believed was cocaine in his office.

USIU TO DROP WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. International University will drop its women's basketball program, 
effective at the end of this season, Coach Cassie Macias said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Women's basketball is the second major sport that USIU has dropped within the 
past year, having eliminated men's hockey after last season. The athletic 
department now has the minimum number of sports -- six each for men and women 
-- required to remain in National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Macias said she had notified Athletic Director Al Palmiotto that she intended 
to resign after the season to pursue other interests. But they decided not to 
announce her resignation until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very coincidental that it happened the same year," Macias said. "One of 
my first questions was, 'Was this because I've resigned?' and Dr. Palmiotto 
said, 'No, they didn't even know about it.' 
</P>
<P>
"They did research into what direction they wanted to go early in the year and 
they told us to stop scheduling and recruiting for all the programs until they 
made a decision," Macias said. "They then decided they would stay Division I." 
</P>
<P>
But not without some sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are the most expensive female sport, " Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
Women's basketball is fully funded at USIU with 15 full-ride scholarship, the 
maximum allowed by the NCAA. USIU's 11 players -- 7 seniors, 1 junior and 3 
freshmen -- will be allowed to transfer without losing a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Macias, in her sixth year at USIU, was the school's first full-time women's 
basketball coach.She started the season with an 85-54 career record, including 
a West Coast Athletic Conference championship and a berth in the Women's 
National Invitation Tournament in the 1985-86 season. The Gulls were 24-9 that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
USIU is 4-12 this season and left this morning for a 3-game trip to Utah, 
Wyoming and Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
USIU finished second in the WCAC in 1986-87, but the school was dropped from 
the conference after the season when the conference aligned its women's 
programs with the men's. 
</P>
<P>
Other that those 2 seasons, USIU has been an independent since turning Division 
I in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate but with the changes coming down it would be hard to maintain 
a certain level of success that we've become accustomed too," said Macias, who 
was an assistant at Northeast Louisiana before coming to USIU. "The scheduling 
was getting very, very tough. We had to travel a lot this year and next year we 
were finding that we would have to travel a lot again. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to feel good about what happened the last 6 years. With all the 
obstacles and challenges we faced, we accomplished a lot."

FREE-THROW LINE OFFERS NO CHARITY TO MEN'S TEAMS

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The men's basketball coaches and players at San Diego State, the University of 
San Diego and U.S. International might be pained to read the numbers in the 
Guinness Book of World Records: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On June 25, 1977, Ted St. Martin of Jacksonville, Fla., made 2,036 free 
throws in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Newman of San Jose made 88 consecutive free throws blindfolded and 338 
of 356 (94.9%) in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 24 hours, Jeff Liles made 15,138 of 17,862 (84.7%). 
</P>
<P>
Last year, UC San Diego's Rob Rittgers set NCAA Division III records for most 
and consecutive free throws in a game when he made 30 of 30, including 24 
successive technical foul shots, against Menlo College. 
</P>
<P>
And 2-year-old Hank Martin of Cincinnati once made -- with a smaller ball and 
basket -- 2 of 6 shots on "Late Night with David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
Worth one point, a free throw is like a 2-foot putt in golf, a 
fourth-and-inches situation in football or a second serve in tennis. It is 
expected to be made, a routine action that draws the most attention when 
missed. This target is 15 feet away and 10 feet high, and nobody is allowed 
directly in front or within 5 feet of the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
The free throw. Even its name implies ease. 
</P>
<P>
But for San Diego's three NCAA Division I men's teams, the free throw has been 
costly in 1988-89. The percentages are .629 at SDSU, .605 at USIU and .600 at 
USD. Each can attribute at least two losses to bad days at the so-called 
"charity stripe." 
</P>
<P>
And while the local Division I men's teams have wallowed around 60% at the 
line, the women's teams at each school are near 70% or better: SDSU is shooting 
74.5%, USD 72.2% and USIU 69.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the statistics have been some dubious occurrences for the men and 
terrific distinctions for the women. 
</P>
<P>
With a sprained thumb, Dana Jackson, a 38% free-throw shooter for SDSU, shot 
two air balls in a row at Utah. USIU has had two shots -- one by Steve Smith 
(72%), the other by Willie Davis (56%) -- hit nothing but air. Another USIU 
player, Tim Moore (30%), missed so wildly that the ball caromed back to him off 
the rubber bottom of the backboard. Mike Sterner, USIU's 6-foot 11-inch center, 
is shooting just 27% from the line. 
</P>
<P>
USD has been the most troubled, losing five games by five points or less. In 
each, poor free-throw shooting, especially down the stretch, was costly. The 
top free-throw shooter on the team, Wayman Strickland, is making 76%. Sophomore 
center Dondi Bell has improved somewhat this season, from 50% to 57%, with a 
new 1-handed style. 
</P>
<P>
USD women Candida Echeverria and Paula Mascari are making 87% and 81%, 
respectively, of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
For SDSU's women, the lowest percentage of the starters is freshman Crystal Lee 
at .739. Center Chana Perry has made 77% (78 of 101), Stefanie Massie 80% and 
Brooke Meadows 84%. Julie Evans has missed only 1 in 25 attempts (96%). For the 
men, Tony Ross (87.5%) is the only player above 80%. Only seven others are 
above 70%. One is Sam Johnson, who has improved from 49% last year to 78% this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has only three women's players (one injured, two reserves) below 67%. The 
men's team has eight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be a free shot," said Aztec center Mitch McMullen, a 50% 
free-throw shooter. "There's no excuse. Shame on us if we don't make it." 
</P>
<P>
So why the trend at each school? Could it be that women are better free throw 
shooters in general? Did Nostradamus predict the wrong shake-up? 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brandenburg, SDSU's men's coach, said, "I think women, in general, have 
better pairs of hands than men. To catch, to pass, to do a lot of different 
dexterous-type things. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that I could statistically prove it. But from my observation of 
30 years of coaching, women can probably outshoot the men within certain 
ranges." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Marpe, USD's women's coach, said, "Women have a more sensitive feel for 
the ball. And they tend to have more patience." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 25, 1986, Marpe's USD team set an NCAA record for free-throw shooting 
percentage in a game by making 24 of 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I think women may have a better mental attitude than men," says USIU men's 
Coach Gary Zarecky. "Everything I've read is that women handle stress better 
than men." 
</P>
<P>
It's all true, says Mike Brum, an SDSU graduate student who works with the 
men's and women's players as a sports psychologist consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been proven, women have a tendency to have greater control over fine 
muscle movement than men do," Brum said. "And they have a built-in system of 
handling stress because their bodies are prepared to bear children. They are 
better able to handle fine motor movements in stressful situations." 
</P>
<P>
Brum adds that free throw shooting is different from the rest of the game 
because you use different motor movements at the line. "I teach relaxation, 
focusing and key words in a process called backward shaping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brum said backward shaping is a method of going through and learning the 
fundamental movements in reverse order to eliminate errors and bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds very psychological, but SDSU women's Coach Earnest Riggins says, 
simply, "Free-throw shooting is mental discipline and concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Poor free-throw shooting, said Brandenburg, "Is kind of like being an 
alcoholic. You'll never beat it until you can say, 'Yes, I'm an alcoholic.' " 
</P>
<P>
What happens, Brandenburg said, "is it really becomes a psychological thing 
with a lot of players. Players that have high anxiety levels, players that are 
hyper and really want to please, those guys will get up there on that foul line 
and their heart comes right up in their throat. You can work on free throws and 
work on free throws, but sometimes you have good free-throw shooting teams and 
sometimes you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said players also tend to see free throws as an unglamorous aspect 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's basketball, you will find very few players that see themselves as 
steady free-throw shooters," he said. "I don't think they picture themselves as 
great free-throw shooters. Those guys are in the minority. Nobody reacts to two 
silky smooth free throws. All the guys are jumping and dunking. So that's what 
young players react to. That's what gets the crowd going." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said that when he was teaching a clinic in Yugoslavia, the European 
players did not want to hear about shooting because they felt they were already 
better shooters than Americans. They wanted to learn about fast breaks and 
fancy passes, because that's what Americans were noted for. 
</P>
<P>
Said USD Coach Hank Egan, "The men's game has become a lot more athletic. And 
maybe we're recruiting that way. Free-throw shooting is a skill function. 
Athleticism has nothing to do with free-throw shooting. Jumping and speed don't 
matter. It's a lot like hitting a golf ball. It's a lot of muscle familiarity. 
</P>

WORLD'S NO. 1 PLAYER LOSES IN STRAIGHT SETS; BECKER BURNS BRIGHT TO EASILY BEAT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ramesh Krishnan of India, ranked 51st in the world, scored the upset of his 
career Thursday and sent ripples across the nearby Yarra River by knocking Mats 
Wilander of Sweden out of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, the world's No. 1 tennis player and the tournament's defending 
champion, lost in shocking manner, a straight-set defeat in the second round. 
Krishnan, 27, won 6-3, 6-2, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my biggest win so far, there's no question about that," Krishnan said. 
"He hasn't played well recently and he's definitely not in good form." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who was forced to 5 sets by Tobias Svantesson before pulling out a 
victory in the first round, gamely fought off 3 match points before going down 
in the tiebreaker when Krishnan punched a backhand volley just out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the first 2 sets, Wilander changed tactics and began coming to the 
net, but Krishnan, who played aggressively from the start, held one match point 
at 5-3 in the third on Wilander's serve. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander escaped that just as he did twice more in the 10th game when Krishnan 
dumped 2 backhand volleys into the net to miss 2 match-point opportunities 
</P>
<P>
Wilander's exit left the top half of the draw wide open for Boris Becker, who 
can see tennis' Grand Slam tournaments in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream is to win all four," Becker said. "I don't think anyone can do it 
this year. Maybe I'm wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Many believe the West German is incorrect, and either he or Ivan Lendl will win 
the Australian Open. Becker, the third-seeded player, moved to the round of 32 
Thursday with a routine 7-5, 7-1, 6-3 victory over Kelly Evernden of New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who meets Chris Pridham of Canada in the fourth round, wasn't 
particularly eager to start handicapping his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally see myself now not one of 128, but one of 32 who have a chance of 
winning the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Pridham, 23, ranked No. 202 in the world, won, 12-10, in the fifth set of a 
4-hour 4-minute match with American Glenn Layendecker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go in there with the frame of mind that he's beatable, but I've 
got nothing to lose," Pridham said. "I just hope I play well." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver, the fourth-seeded woman, clearly did not play well in her match 
against Sarah Loosemore, 17, of Great Britain, but she avoided an upset with a 
1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, who had trouble serving, was helped by Loosemore, who also had 
problems serving. She double-faulted 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said the Rebound Ace surface does not favor a big service game but 
admitted that serving was only part of her problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go out there thinking I was exactly playing a blind school," Shriver 
said. "When I looked at the scoreboard and saw 6-1, I realized I was having 
some problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to grit my way through and develop some kind of form that's better 
in a hurry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miloslav Mecir and Mikael Pernfors advanced, but Anders Jarryd did not. Mecir, 
seeded ninth, defeated Mark Kratzmann, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2, and the 12th-seeded 
Pernfors defeated Tore Meinecke of West Germany, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir, unshaven and with a slightly rumpled appearance, looked as if he had 
just fallen out of bed and landed on the tennis court for his 10 a.m. match. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit early for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The time was clearly right for Hana Mandlikova and Helena Sukova, who joined 
Shriver in the third round with victories. 
</P>
<P>
However, 14th-seeded Anne Minter was defeated by Brenda Schultz of the 
Netherlands, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Sabatini, seeded third, advanced with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over 
Conchita Martinez, 16, of Spain in a late Center Court match Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But fifth-seeded Jakob Hlasek was not as fortunate. Hlasek was ousted by 
Australian Darren Cahill, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Hlasek, who was the last seeded man to play his first-round match, became the 
third to lose, following Frenchmen Henri Leconte and Yannick Noah. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who reached the round of 16 here last year and was eliminated in the 
first round in 1985, said he is aiming for more consistency in Grand Slam 
events. Sometimes such results, even if they are not victories, would naturally 
improve his ranking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to become the No. 1 player, you have to have those semifinals in 
Grand Slam events," he said. "This is the key, I think, for really going a step 
higher.

MORNING BRIEFING: AN UNCOURTLY STATURE FOR MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 24 hours before their biggest game of the season, the sixth-ranked 
Michigan Wolverines were relegated to a basketball court tucked away in the 
back of the school's intramural building for a final practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, who lost the next day to Illinois, were kept out of Crisler 
Arena by a wrestling meet and a women's basketball game, and the team couldn't 
get a court for practice until a forfeit in one of the intramural games opened 
up the floor.

When Notre Dame's football team held its first meeting since winning the 
national championship, Coach Lou Holtz suddenly realized how tough it may be to 
repeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We covered a variety of things," Holtz said of the meeting. "Then I excused 
the seniors and we addressed next season. A lot more guys walked out than what 
the papers said we were losing. Reading the papers, I figured the whole team 
was back. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a better team when we started the meeting because a lot of guys were 
not there when we ended it." 
</P>

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason has a clause in his contract that 
prohibits him from doing a television show or writing a book or newspaper and 
magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not allowed to write books," Esiason told reporters at the Super Bowl in 
Miami this week. "I'm not allowed to host my own television show. You have the 
Dan Marino Show down here; we're not allowed to have the Boomer Esiason Show. 
I'm not allowed to sponsor a newspaper article or ghostwrite a magazine 
article.

When shooting broke out in Miami Monday night, Joe Wellisch, who has season 
tickets to the Miami Heat's basketball games, was warned by his wife not to go 
to the game against the Phoenix Suns, which was eventually called off. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife called me from Chicago and said, 'Don't go.' " Wellisch said. "I said, 
'I'm here and you're there.' Then she said, 'Don't take the BMW, take the 
Honda.' "

LEGENDS OF FREESTYLE SET AT BEAR MOUNTAIN JAN. 29

<P>
Freestyle skiing has been making a comeback after falling into disfavor 
following the wild days -- and liability-insurance problems -- of the early 
1970s. It was a demonstration sport in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, 
Canada, and will become a medal sport in the '92 Winter Games at Albertville, 
France. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the trend, Bear Mountain, at Big Bear Lake, will play host to 8 
of the top freestylers from "the old days" when it stages the Legends of 
Freestyle Challenge on Jan. 29, in conjunction with Powder magazine and 
Jeep/Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
The field, lured by $5,000 in prize money, will be composed of Wayne Wong, John 
Clendenin, Scott Brooksbank, Bob Salerno, John Eaves, Greg Athans, Mark 
Steigemier and Eddie Ferguson. They'll ski the moguls on Showtime run in pairs 
until a winner is determined. 
</P>
<P>
The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles has granted $29,055 to the 
California Handicapped Skiers' Foundation to fund a learn-to-ski program for 75 
participants, including 50 children from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, during February at Bear Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by David L. Wolper, chairman, and Anita L. DeFrantz, 
president, of the organization, which is endowed with the Southland's share of 
the surplus from the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Beginners who plan to take advantage of a free skiing offer Friday at selected 
California resorts should visit a participating ski shop today or this evening, 
if possible, in addition to calling the area for a reservation -- also no later 
than today. 
</P>
<P>
There are 76 such shops in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, plus more in San Diego county. If you're in doubt whether your 
favorite shop is involved, give them a call. 
</P>
<P>
Friday has been declared National Ski Day by Congress, and 7 areas in Southern 
California -- Bear Mountain, Kratka Ridge, Mountain High, Ski Green Valley, Ski 
Sunrise, Snow Summit and Snow Valley -- are offering a limited number of free 
one-day "scholarships" for first-time skiers on that day. The package, 
available by reservation only, includes lift ticket or trail pass, rental 
equipment and an introductory lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Northern and Central California areas, including Mammoth-June, Sierra 
Summit and Badger Pass-Yosemite, and 6 Sierra Nordic centers are also offering 
the freebies, which are limited in number. According to the co-sponsoring 
National Ski Areas Assn. and Ski Industries America, the best way to assure a 
place in the program is to go to a ski shop to obtain the required coupon and 
to call the ski area. Most of the areas will have coupons available but could 
run out early. 
</P>
<P>
The shops will also be offering discounts beginning Saturday and continuing 
through Feb. 17, a period they're calling, "Let's Go Skiing America Month." 
They will provide non-skiers with coupons good for a beginner package at no 
more than $25 on weekends and $15 midweek for Alpine skiing, and no more than 
$20 on weekends and $10 midweek for Nordic (cross-country) skiing. Again, an 
advance reservation is needed at the area or center of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pro Tour will stop at Mt. Bachelor, Ore., this weekend . . . Last 
weekend's pro races at Telluride, Colo., will be shown on ESPN Sunday at 2 
p.m., PST -- opposite some football game on Channel 4 -- and will be followed 
at 2:30 by Bob Beattie's "Ski World" and a tape of Saturday's World Cup men's 
downhill at Wengen, Switzerland, at 3. . . . The men will race in a World Cup 
slalom Sunday, and combined points will also be awarded for the 2 days. . . . 
The women on the World Cup circuit will be at Tignes, France, for a downhill 
Thursday, a super-G Friday and a giant slalom Saturday. A women's super-G 
scheduled for Oberstaufen, West Germany, on Sunday has been postponed due to a 
snow shortage and will be held in Japan in March.

USIU HAS ENOUGH FIREPOWER TO DEFEAT UCSD

As far as tuneups go, U.S. International University's men's basketball game 
against UC San Diego at Golden Hall Wednesday night definitely was a 4-cylinder 
job. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, which was playing its 21st game of the season, didn't operate at full 
power most of the night. But the Gulls did have enough to beat the NCAA 
Division III Tritons, 106-89, in front of 387. 
</P>
<P>
USIU (8-13) readies itself for a rematch with Loyola Marymount, Jan. 31 at Los 
Angeles. Loyola defeated USIU, 162-144, at Golden Hall Jan. 7 and set three 
NCAA records in the process -- including 93 points in the first half by Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Gulls will get a much-needed rest. USIU has played 13 of its 21 
games on the road, including 3 before playing host to the Tritons (5-10) 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"(The players) were out of it mentally, so it was athletic ability that was the 
difference," said Gary Zarecky, USIU coach. "(UCSD) was in it mentally and 
physically. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're tired. I'm tired and the players are tired. The number of games is 
affecting us, not who we're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Although USIU is a Division I team it has had its problems with UCSD. The teams 
had split a 6-game series before Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the teams played in Golden Hall, UCSD defeated USIU, 106-94, in 
the 1986-87 season opener. 
</P>
<P>
And the Tritons kept Wednesday's game close until midway through the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 8-8, USIU outscored UCSD, 14-2, to take a 22-10 lead. The 
Gulls expanded the lead to 44-26 with 5:10 remaining in the half and then 
settled for a 50-40 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons outplayed the Gulls early in the second half and pulled to within 
62-58 with 13:36 remaining on 2 free throws by Bill Gerlach. 
</P>
<P>
But USIU outscored the Tritons, 15-1, to put the game out of reach at 77-59 
with 8:56 remaining. The Gulls held their biggest lead at 96-79 and led, 
106-77, before the Tritons scored the final 12 points of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls got a big advantage by outrebounding the Tritons 55-39 and UCSD 
stayed in the game by making 26 of 34 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wilson had 23 points to lead USIU. Gary Williams had 20 and Demetrius 
Laffitte added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Gulls. Erik Quigley scored 18 
points, including 16 in the first half to lead UCSD. The Gulls held the 
Tritons' Gordon McNeill, the team's leading scorer with 12.5 points per game, 
to just 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
After playing Loyola, the USIU opens its final home stand of the season. The 
Gulls play host to Southern Utah State Feb. 6, followed by the University of 
Missouri-Kansas City (Jan. 13) and Point Loma Nazarene (Feb. 20).

AFTER SLAYING THE GIANT, UC RIVERSIDE NOW MUST SURVIVE THE PRESSURE 
</P>

<P>
For the UC Riverside basketball team, the easy part may have been defeating 
highly ranked Iowa in the final of the Chaminade Christmas Classic 3 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Living up to the expectations that come with such a victory, well, that's where 
the difficulty begins, said Coach John Masi. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it hasn't bothered the Highlanders (12-2), who have won 4 straight by 
an average margin of more than 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Masi said there has been pressure from the 110-92 victory at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely created more attention as far as the publicity we've 
received," Masi said. "ESPN mentioned us prominently and they listed it as one 
of the top 10 upsets of the year. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . It's definitely brought us attention like we've never had before." 
</P>
<P>
Since the victory over Iowa, which was ranked No. 4 in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.'s Division I at the time, tickets to Riverside home games have 
been in demand. 
</P>
<P>
"Expectations on our team are tremendous now," Masi said. "Our last 3 
(nonconference) games were sold out and our (conference) game against (Cal 
Poly) Pomona was, too. You can just feel the pressure. I call it the Mickey 
Mantle Theory. Every time we go out, they expect us to hit a home run." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure does not figure to decrease with Tuesday's announcement that the 
Highlanders have been ranked No. 2 behind Virginia Union in the first 
regular-season Division II poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rankings and the articles that could be written about us are just 
the kind of thing that can hurt us against other teams," Masi said. "It's nice 
to get the publicity but these are the kind of things that the other teams like 
to play up. It's the kind of thing that winds up on bulletin boards." 
</P>
<P>
Masi said beating Iowa is something that he and his team will probably remember 
for a long time. It was even more memorable because Iowa was the first 
nationally ranked Division I team that Riverside had ever faced and the 
Highlanders were a late entrant into the tournament, having replaced New Mexico 
State, which had dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had two or three Division I teams on our schedule and we've 
promised our players that we would schedule along those lines," Masi said. "We 
were just hoping for the opportunity to play those kind of teams but we didn't 
go over there expecting to win or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I told our players and they just feel it was an experience they'll 
always remember." 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, Masi is hoping his team can concentrate on the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. season. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't leave your season back with one game," Masi said. "We've discussed 
it. We've brought that up many a time. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep it in the proper perspective and sometimes that's tough to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
It's tougher still now that the Highlanders have lost two starters to injuries. 
First, forward Jimmy Shorters suffered a broken rib and deflated lung against 
Iowa and then forward Chris Ceballos broke a finger in the team's next game, 
against UC Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Neither has played since and Masi said it has tested his team's depth, although 
you couldn't tell by the team's recent success. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't bothered us yet and I guess for 1 or 2 games you can make do," he 
said. "But over the course of the league season, I don't think you can. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to paint a bleak picture but we want all of our players back. We 
play eight or nine people. That's our style. So if we don't have them, we have 
to change things." 
</P>
<P>
Masi said Riverside's depth probably has been most responsible for the success. 
The Highlanders have five players averaging in double figures in scoring and 
three others averaging 7 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one plus that the depth has done for us," he said. "We haven't had to 
throw somebody fresh into the system." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Maurice Pullum averages 18.9 points and right behind are Ceballos at 15.8 
points, Shorters at 11.7, forward Pat Vieira at 10.8 and reserve guard Reggie 
Howard at 10. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive has been Riverside's 3-point shooting. The Highlanders, 
who average 10.1 3-pointers a game, have made 142 of 302 3-point shots. Howard 
has made 25 of 44 and Pullum 49 of 102, ranking among the Division II leaders. 
</P>
<P>
That also helps explain how the Highlanders have outscored their opponents by 
an average of 21 points, 96.4-75.4, and scored more than 100 points 6 times. 
</P>
<P>
Masi also credits his team's success to the leadership of seniors such as 
Pullum, Vieira, Shorters and guard Chris Jackson, a former Santa Ana Mater Dei 
High standout who averages 8.6 points and 5.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these guys are tremendous leaders," Masi said. "It's definitely made a 
difference. Hopefully it will help us as the year goes along." 
</P>
<P>
Masi hopes the team can realize its goals of winning the conference title and 
gaining a second-straight berth in the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to take the 1-game-at-a-time theory but we feel that if they continue 
to play like they can, we can achieve those goals," Masi said.

BRUINS LOOK TO PAC-10 FOR PICK-ME-UP; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER NONCONFERENCE FRUSTRATIONS, THEY FACE ARIZONA STATE, STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What's the best that could be said of UCLA's 82-79 loss to Notre Dame last 
Saturday, in which the Bruins squandered leads of 13 points in the first half 
and 8 points in the last 10 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a league game," Coach Jim Harrick said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
True enough. 
</P>
<P>
Although UCLA, in Harrick's opinion, has given away games to UC Irvine and 
Notre Dame in the last 3 weeks, neither loss affected the Bruins' standing in 
the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who will play Arizona State tonight at Pauley Pavilion, remain in a 
virtual tie for first place in the Pac-10. They are 9-4 overall and 4-1 in 
conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is 6-1 in the Pac-10, and Stanford, which will play host to the Bruins 
Saturday at Maples Pavilion, is 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Recent games, though, have revealed the Bruins' lack of depth. 
</P>
<P>
Since freshman Darrick Martin replaced sophomore Kevin Williams as Pooh 
Richardson's running mate in the backcourt, the Bruins have had little 
offensive spark off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is mostly a defensive specialist, as evidenced by the fact that he has 
scored 4 points in his last 3 games. Keith Owens doesn't score much, either. He 
is averaging fewer than 2 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' only scoring threat off the bench is Charles Rochelin, who is 
erratic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to play the hand that was dealt to me," Harrick said. "I can't talk 
about that because there are some times that those kids can come off the bench 
and score. Charles can. Kevin Williams can. Keith Owens needs a little more 
experience to be able to, but I don't worry about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our bench is adequate. It could be worse. It could be better. (But) I 
don't think our level of play goes down too much when the reserves come in." 
</P>
<P>
That's debatable, of course, but Harrick will certainly get no sympathy from 
the Sun Devils, who came to Los Angeles without the two players who are 
arguably the best in their program. 
</P>
<P>
Emory Lewis, a 6-foot 10-inch sophomore center from San Bernardino High, has 
not played this season because of a stress fracture in his left foot, and point 
guard Tarence Wheeler underwent major reconstructive surgery on his right knee 
less than 2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, who was averaging 15.5 points a game, is expected to be in a 
wheelchair for another 3 months and probably will miss next season, too. His 
knee buckled as he moved through the lane late in the first half of an 84-60 
loss to California Jan. 5 at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, which is 8-6 overall and 2-4 in the Pac-10, has struggled 
without him. In an 85-65 loss to Oregon State last Saturday, the Sun Devils had 
30 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Patterson, calling it "a start born out of necessity," said this 
week that freshman guard Adrian Brown will make his starting debut tonight. The 
status of the guards who had been starting, Mike Redhair and Matt Anderson, was 
left up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trent Edwards, a 6-7, 237-pound forward who started his college career as a 
football player at Texas Christian, leads Arizona State in scoring (17.8-point 
average), rebounding (8.4), and field-goal percentage (61.4). . . . UCLA was 
originally scheduled to play Arizona Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, but the game 
was moved to March 4 so that it could be nationally televised by NBC.

MARCIANO'S 28 VAULT SIMI VALLEY INTO FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that no matter what happens, who wins, who loses, there is always a 
streak hanging in the balance with the Simi Valley High basketball team. When 
last heard from, the Pioneers had dropped their first Marmonte League game in 
their past 32, to Westlake on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Simi Valley turned the corner Wednesday night and looked ahead to its 
second loop around the league, first-year Coach Dean Bradshaw and his Pioneers 
still have a rally cry. Trite, but to the point, it's "one more for four." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to focus in on every game," Bradshaw said after the 
Pioneers beat Camarillo, 70-63, at Simi Valley to win their fifth league game 
in 6 tries and regain possession of first place. "We still talk about one more 
for four every day." 
</P>
<P>
And you thought it was getting tedious reading once in a while about the fact 
that the Pioneers are chasing their fourth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Every day? 
</P>
<P>
"We're in first place by ourselves right now," he added. "I hope we can say 
that at the end of the second round." 
</P>
<P>
A few more games for senior guard Jeff Marciano like the one he had against 
Camarillo, and Bradshaw's wishes will be Marciano's command. 
</P>
<P>
After making all 5 of his first-half field-goal attempts, Marciano was good on 
his first 4 in the second and finished with a game-high 28 points. They 
included 2 free throws with 16 seconds left that finished off a tenacious but 
depleted Camarillo team that entered the game 4-0 in league play. Simi Valley 
is 5-1 in league play and in front by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Marciano appeared to be the only player who remained focused in a wildly 
emotional game that saw 50 fouls called, 1 technical and 3 Scorpion starters 
foul out. 
</P>
<P>
"God, we were playing for first, it kind of means a lot," Marciano said of the 
intensity level. "You kind of get ticked off pretty easily." 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else got mad, Marciano kept Camarillo from getting even. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions, however, were in something of a hole from the start. David 
Harbour, who leads the team in scoring and assists and is second in rebounding, 
missed the game because of an injured left ankle. He probably will not play 
against Newbury Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Add to Harbour's absence point guard Rick Schnell's bruised knee in the third 
quarter that forced him to sit out most of the fourth and the foul troubles of 
forwards Frank Dews and Scott Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously David adds a lot for their team from the perimeter," Bradshaw said. 
"That gives them one less bullet to fire with." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo responded with balanced scoring that brought it back from a 58-50 
fourth-quarter deficit to within 62-60 with 2:10 remaining. However, Simi 
Valley's Steve Carnes hit 4 consecutive free throws followed by 2 from 
Marciano. The Pioneers made 25 of 30 free throws, compared to 17 of 33 for 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really executed well," Camarillo Coach John Harbour said. "We did 
some good things individually, but we never did execute well." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, streaky as ever, ended up making 21 of 37 field-goal attempts. 
Camarillo made just 21 of 54.

TOROS TAKE AIM AT RIVERSIDE IN EARLY SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Dave Yanai at Cal State Dominguez Hills prefers to play down the 
importance of one game. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no way his UC Riverside counterpart, Dave Masi, would beat around 
the bush about tonight's 8:05 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tip-off 
between the two schools in the Toro gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it, this is an early-season showdown," Masi said. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe, you say, particularly since little old Division II Riverside 
(12-2) drew national attention a few weeks back with a shocking 110-92 victory 
over second-ranked Division I powerhouse Iowa while the Toros were losing to 
Cal State Hayward and Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Even more difficult to consider because Dominguez Hills (9-5) spent most of its 
preseason schedule spinning its wheels while Riverside was marching to second 
place in national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, says Yanai, this is only the second CCAA contest for both 1-0 clubs. 
"I don't put much importance on this game over any other. This is just one of 
13 more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Dominguez Hills wants to make good on the contender status Yanai 
predicted before the season, this is the night to make a statement to the other 
seven teams in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
A Toro victory, says Masi, would prove what he has thought for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"There are five or six teams that can win this conference," he said. "Dominguez 
Hills is one." 
</P>
<P>
Masi's team is one of his own picks too. Riverside brings an eight-game winning 
streak into the contest and on paper has a leg up on its preseason co-favorite, 
defending champion Cal State Bakersfield, which was upset in its opener last 
week by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Masi says he is uneasy about tonight's game, but Yanai could see only one 
reason for Masi's concern: "This game may be more important for them since it 
is a road game." 
</P>
<P>
Masi pointed to other areas of concern: "Dominguez Hills is peaking at the 
right time. I saw them play last Saturday and they looked excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"We are a long way from (peaking)," Yanai responded. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries may play a part in the game. Riverside is expected to be without 
starting forward Jimmy Shorters (broken rib) and sixth man Chris Ceballos (bone 
chip in knuckle). Each has missed four games. Shorters played his freshman year 
at Dominguez Hills in the 1983-84 season. Also missing for the last four 
contests has been Toro starting forward Kenyatta Kalisana (knee injury). Yanai 
said Kalisana is expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
Masi says his game plan may change if either of his players can't play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This could be the biggest game in the last two seasons for Dominguez Hills. The 
Toros, who lost both times to Riverside last year, nevertheless finished the 
season winning seven of their last 10 CCAA games and narrowly missed a 
postseason conference tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
With three of five starters back, the Toros figure to make a run for one of 
those four tournament spots. Despite stumbling early in the season, Dominguez 
Hills brings a four-game winning streak into tonight's game. The Toros have won 
nine of their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a little more level play early in the year," Yanai said. "I'm 
pleased with the play right now. This certainly is the right time (to gel)." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside leads the CCAA in scoring, averaging 96 points a game. Dominguez 
Hills is the top defensive team, allowing 63 a contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We handle the transition game well," Yanai said, "but we function at a slower 
pace -- not a slow pace, but maybe a score like in the 70s." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills will need a big night from its All-American candidate, senior 
center Anthony Blackmon. Blackmon, who was voted the CCAA's Player of the Week 
after an 82-71 victory last Friday over Chapman College, has averaged 21 points 
and nine rebounds a game in his last seven outings. The 6-7 post has averaged 
three assists during the four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills will be at Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday night at 8:05. Women's 
games precede both contests at 5:45 tonight and Saturday.

SPIRITED RACHEL GAGLIANO OF MONROE HIGH ASKS AND TAKES NO QUARTER AS SHE GAMELY 
COMPETES IN BOYS' SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just try to knock down Rachel Gagliano on the soccer field and see what 
happens. "I'm a big girl, I can defend myself," said Gagliano, a 5-foot-3 1/2, 
122-pound junior midfielder on the Monroe High soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
That's the boys' soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Of approximately 300 players on 15 Valley-area City Section boys' soccer teams, 
Gagliano is the only girl. Gagliano, a member of the U. S. Youth Soccer Assn. 
Junior National Pool for players under 19 years of age, transferred from 
Alemany High last September so she could attend school in the neighborhood 
where she grew up -- and play on a boys' team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing with boys on club teams since I was 12," she said. "That's 
why I had trouble at Alemany. My level of aggression was a lot higher than the 
girls. I'd get called for a lot of fouls because I'm rough. I'm used to playing 
with guys." 
</P>
<P>
But she is not accustomed to yielding to them. 
</P>
<P>
Already a trend-setter, Gagliano is going one step further: When the going gets 
rough, she takes no guff. 
</P>
<P>
"There are games that have been rough, but it doesn't bother me," she said. "I 
grew up with three older brothers beating me up all the time, so I was 
well-prepared for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to getting knocked around and I'm used to fighting back. If I get 
knocked, I knock back harder." 
</P>
<P>
If she won't, her teammates will. "If it's a cheap shot, of course we'd get 
mad," junior forward Jose Valdez said. "If we had to do something, we'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, this is the inaugural season for City Section girls' soccer. But 
when Monroe was unable to field a team because no coach was available, 
Gagliano's wish was fulfilled. City and Southern Section rules prohibit girls 
playing on boys' teams, unless no girls' team in that sport is offered. 
</P>
<P>
All concerned have benefited from the circumstances. Monroe is 7-0, 3-0 in 
Valley Pac-8 Conference play, and although Gagliano has scored just 1 goal -- a 
penalty kick in a 1-0 win over Poly -- she cracked the starting lineup in 
Wednesday's 3-2 win over Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Her contribution, Coach Les Sasvary said, cannot be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent is talent and she's got it," Sasvary said. "She's a good passer, a good 
ballhandler. And she's the best penalty shooter on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gagliano's push-comes-to-shove attitude has made her coach uneasy about 
giving her playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"She stands up to the boys and that's what I'm worried about," Sasvary said. "I 
can picture that it's going to get physical." 
</P>
<P>
It already has. Sasvary has pulled Gagliano out of 2 matches this season "for 
her own safety." 
</P>
<P>
"Against Taft," Gagliano said, "a guy and I went up to head the ball and I 
knocked him down. Then the guy started saying all kinds of stuff to me." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez's version of the story includes the opponent attempting to kick 
Gagliano. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys tried to defend her," he said. "But nothing really happened. We 
worry about her, but we know she can take care of herself." 
</P>
<P>
When things became physical against Kennedy, Sasvary again removed Gagliano. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it when he does that," Gagliano said. "See, he doesn't want me to get 
hurt. But I told him, 'Everybody on this team is going to get hurt before I 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Sasvary: "It would not be in the best interest of myself and my team to 
have her hurt. I think she can take care of herself, but it's still my 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacity is innate with Gagliano, according to Berhane Andeberhan, women's 
soccer coach at Stanford and Western Regional coach of the USYSA women's team. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very determined," Andeberhan said. "Even when she was one of the 
youngest ones and didn't quite have the maturity and talent, she wanted it. She 
felt like she should make it, the implication being that she would make it and 
she did." 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano, who began playing when she was 4, entered the Olympic Development 
program at 12. And in November, as a member of the 14-state Western Regional 
team, she was one of 72 players selected to attend a national camp in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
There she was selected among 30 players for the National Pool and elevated from 
the under-16 to the under-19 team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a rarity," Andeberhan said. "It's quite an honor to be moved up and 
considered one of the top 30." 
</P>
<P>
Although women's soccer is not a scheduled event for the 1992 Olympics in 
Barcelona, Spain, the idea is being kicked around, Andeberhan said. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano's goal is to be one of the 16 players selected for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that would mean back to playing with girls, er, women. 
</P>
<P>
"That's different, though," she said, "because once you get up higher, the 
competition is higher." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Gagliano must content herself with "guys who think, 'I'm the guy 
out here and I'll knock you around.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let it get to me, because I know I'm good enough to be out there," she 
said. "Eventually, they'll learn that what they said was dumb. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of myself. I think I have a lot of guts."

THOMAS CHANGES STYLE AND TAFT FASHIONS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most players, picking up foul No. 4 with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third 
quarter means it is a cinch that one of the following will take place: 
</P>
<P>
The whistle sounds and the coach, like Pavlov's dogs, salivates. In most cases, 
the coach then chews off the player's ear. 
</P>
<P>
The player pleads his case to the coach with no success and spends the next few 
minutes sitting beside the not-ready-for-prime-time players. 
</P>
<P>
In rare instances, the coach chews off a fingernail and, out of desperation, 
decides to stick with the player. 
</P>
<P>
In Taft's Northwest Valley Conference game against El Camino Real on Wednesday, 
Taft Coach Jim Woodard went for Plan 3, and it paid off. The offender, senior 
guard Dedan Thomas, scored 7 points in the final 2:31 of the third quarter to 
lead Taft to a 76-57 win at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard admitted that no alternatives came to mind when Thomas was called for 
his fourth foul with more than 10 minutes left in the game and Taft holding a 
42-30 lead. In fact, Woodard had made up his mind before the whistle had 
stopped blowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play without him," Woodard said in a matter-of-fact tone. "I was 
afraid they'd catch up in about three minutes with him out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Out of pure self-preservation, Woodard told Thomas to relax on defense. No 
problem, Thomas said. Woodard ordered Thomas to not risk a charging foul and to 
stop driving to the basket for layups. That caused big problems -- for El 
Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas made 3 consecutive jump shots from the 17-foot range and added a free 
throw to key an 11-3 run that gave Taft (14-1, 4-0 in league play) a commanding 
53-36 lead after 3 quarters. His style tempered by the fouls, Thomas went 
through his list of options and chose the outside shot, which heretofore has 
not been his hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me have to shoot jump shots," Thomas said about the foul trouble. 
"(Woodard) told me to drive in as far as I could, then pull up, so I did." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' trio of long-rangers knocked out El Camino Real, which was already on 
the ropes after a series of critical third-quarter mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (4-7, 1-3) trailed, 31-17, at halftime but rallied to within 
33-25 with 5:08 left in the third quarter. After fouling Taft center Jason 
Deyoe, forward Charlie Crow was called for a technical with 4:26 remaining. 
Deyoe, Tony Middleton (16 points, 9 rebounds) and Thomas each made a free throw 
to give Taft an 11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Reid made a 3-point shot on El Camino Real's next possession to again 
cut the deficit to 8. Reid's basket was only the second scored by a 
Conquistadore other than senior forward Brent Lofton, who finished with a 
season-high 32 points on 14-of-27 shooting. Reid snapped a streak in which 
Lofton, who was playing his second game since fainting at home because of 
malnutrition, had scored 7 consecutive team field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Although he almost single-handedly kept El Camino Real in striking range, 
Lofton also committed a miscue that bolstered Taft's momentum late in the third 
quarter. Lofton picked up his fourth foul with 39 seconds left but left the 
floor before a referee waved a substitute into the game, triggering a 
technical. Deyoe made his 2 foul shots, added 2 more from the technical, and, 
on the ensuing possession, Thomas hit a 17-foot jump shot to give Taft a 53-36 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Taft employed a zone defense all game, hardly a surprise to El Camino Real 
Coach Mike McNulty, who spent Tuesday's practice schooling the team on how to 
break up the rather rudimentary defensive set. 
</P>
<P>
He had a rude awakening. 
</P>
<P>
"We drilled, drilled and drilled," McNulty said as he drilled the team 
verbally. "I don't understand it. We stand out there on the wing all game long 
and stare at the open man in the post, and we don't get the ball in to him." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real center Jason Steele, in fact, scored only 2 points. Other than 
Lofton, no Conquistadore scored more than 4 points.

Gardena 76, San Pedro 67 -- When Gardena plays its full-court, man-to-man 
pressure defense well, basketball opponents usually turn the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
But when Gardena moves into a zone, it becomes vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Those axioms were painfully evident Wednesday afternoon at Gardena where the 
Mohicans and San Pedro squared off in a Southern Pacific Conference contest. 
</P>
<P>
With the man-to-man, the Mohicans constructed leads of 12 and 15 points. 
Without it, San Pedro cut into the deficit and almost tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys love to play man-to-man defense, trapping the ball handler and 
forcing turnovers," said Mohicans Assistant Coach Leo Onomura. "And we get the 
best out of our players when we play that way." 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind 4-0, the Mohicans switched to their trapping defense and 
built a 37-22 lead midway through the second quarter. But when they went into 
the zone, San Pedro cut the lead to 48-46 with 3:10 remaining in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena then went back into the man-to-man for the rest of the game and that, 
coupled with Chris Thompson's six of seven from the free-throw line in the 
final minute, helped the Mohicans withstand San Pedro's late charge. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena improved to 11-6 overall and 2-2 in the conference while San Pedro fell 
to 6-8 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no real turning point in the game," said Onomura, who was subbing 
for Coach Bill Hughes. "We were just able to create some momentum and control 
the tempo with our defense and press." 
</P>
<P>
Center Kevin Sanders poured in a game-high 24 points, including 16 in the 
second half, while Thompson and Curtis Green each had 13. Cedric Williams 
knocked down 11 and guard Darryl McMillan scored eight and dished out eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jay Horton paced San Pedro with 22, John Wells contributed 12 and 
Willie Sanchez and Devay Reese scored 10 apiece. TIM DERMODY

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE FACES STERN CCAA ROAD TEST TONIGHT AT BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You think negotiating moguls on your last ski run was a true test of athletic 
ability? 
</P>
<P>
That's mere child's play compared to navigating the hazards of the floor at the 
Bakersfield Civic Auditorium, according to those who try to play basketball on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? You can see moguls. 
</P>
<P>
But dead spots on a basketball floor lurk invisible beneath the surface -- 
similar to land mines ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
And when they do? Thud. So much for that fast break. 
</P>
<P>
However, the floor is not the toughest part about playing at Cal State 
Bakersfield, which happens to be Cal State Northridge's assignment tonight at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"Above all," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said, "they are a very talented team." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, 11-3 and ranked 19th in the nation, was rated among the best 10 
Division II teams in several preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners, the CCAA's defending regular-season co-champions, also are 
supported by a highly partisan -- and often obnoxious -- capacity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Bakersfield is the toughest place in the conference to play by far," said John 
Masi, coach of second-ranked Riverside and a one-time target for a beer-tossing 
Roadrunner fan. "The other ones don't even compare. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd is part of it -- they're extremely negative toward the opposing 
team. And then there's the floor, and the lights." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the lights. 
</P>
<P>
"They're bad at the south end of the floor," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with shadows and glare is not nearly as unpredictable as coping with 
the floor, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like there's one or two bad spots, you know," Masi said. "There's a 
bunch of them." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, who says most of the bad spots are near the sidelines, claims he has 
never heard a complaint from a player -- at least not to his face. 
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't be taking the ball over half-court down the sideline against 
pressure, anyway," Cassidy said. "Maybe the dead spots are justifiable 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Northridge has been more successful than most when visiting the 
2,300-seat Civic. The Matadors have won 3 of their past 4 games at the 27-year 
old facility. 
</P>
<P>
After Bakersfield, the next game on the Matadors' agenda is Saturday at Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, which, in Masi's estimation, is the second-toughest place 
to play in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs were 14-0 in their home gym last season and they knocked off 
heavily favored Bakersfield, 78-73, there Friday.

DETERMINED RIO MESA STOPS SANTA BARBARA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though the game was delayed 45 minutes and the scoreboard clock was 
inoperative, nothing was going to stop the Rio Mesa High basketball team 
Wednesday night from remaining unbeaten in the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of delays, hassles, confusion and even a late-game brawl, Rio 
Mesa battled to defeat Santa Barbara, 68-59, in a league game at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Baras' basket and free throw with 3:42 left gave the Spartans the lead 
for good as they converted 12 of 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to seal 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (10-7, 4-2) scored 8 consecutive points to begin the fourth 
quarter and take a 54-50 lead before the fight erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Killgore grabbed an offensive rebound for Rio Mesa when the Dons' David 
Palmer threw a hard elbow at Killgore's head and both teams went into a 
head-long brawl into the first 2 rows of the Rio Mesa rooting section. 
</P>
<P>
After another 5-minute delay, Palmer was ejected and Killgore went to the line 
and made 1 of 2 free throws. Eric Thomas then made 2 technical free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa had the ball for a possible 6-point play. But the Spartans turned the 
ball over. 
</P>
<P>
After a basket by the Dons' Dan Purdy, Rio Mesa turned on a 9-0 spurt to open 
up a 62-56 lead on Baras' 3-point play and timely free throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led Rio Mesa with 16 points and Garner, who was scoreless in the first 
half, added 14 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara held a 12-8 lead in the first quarter when Bruce Yamamoto came 
off the bench for Rio Mesa (13-3, 6-0) and immediately canned a 3-point shot to 
draw the Spartans to within 1. The Dons were hitting from the field in the 
first quarter, making 8 of 11 shots to take an 18-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's Paul Perkins scored 2 quick baskets as the Dons took their 
biggest lead of the first half, 22-15. The Spartans then reeled off 6 
consecutive points eventually evened the score, 31-31, at halftime.

SAN FERNANDO BECOMES LATEST CLEVELAND VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With Cleveland High tearing up the Northwest Valley Conference, San Fernando 
boys' basketball Coach Dick Crowell adopted a realistic approach to Wednesday's 
game at San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of succumbing to the pressure of playing The Times' top-ranked team in 
the Valley area, Crowell resolved to take the game -- and an anticipated loss 
-- in stride. 
</P>
<P>
The approach proved prudent for Crowell and San Fernando as Cleveland 
controlled the game from start to finish en route to an 89-65 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell had expected as much. "We're going to try and run on them, and if that 
doesn't work we won't be worse off than anyone else they've played," he said 
before the game. "But no matter what happens, I'm going to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (7-10, 1-3 in conference play) appeared to enjoy themselves early 
on, taking a 4-2 lead on Sean Williams' breakaway layup and stretching the lead 
to 6 points with a pair of unanswered baskets. 
</P>
<P>
But the good times came to a screeching halt for San Fernando. Adonis Jordan, 
who finished with 21 points, hit the front end of a 1-and-1, sending Cleveland 
on a 19-2 run that ended with a Lucious Harris dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (14-2, 4-0) forced 15 first-half turnovers to stretch its lead to 
39-26 at intermission and broke the game open with scoring runs of 14-3 and 
15-4 in the second half. Harris led all scorers with 23 points and Ben Boyd led 
San Fernando with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the easy victory, Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell was dissatisfied with 
his team's intensity. "You do get a sense of complacency, but before we get 
into the playoffs, we're going to have to get out of this rut," Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, who is gearing his team for a Friday encounter at El Camino Real, got 
exactly what he bargained for from the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone in our league is going to beat Cleveland," said Crowell. 
"This Friday's game is the game we've been looking forward to. This was just 
fun."

CS NORTHRIDGE KEEPS A TIGHT REIN ON OPERATING COSTS IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge may be less than 2 years removed from Division I status in 
men's basketball but make no mistake, it still practices fiscal restraint. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will play important California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games at 
Cal State Bakersfield tonight and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Saturday. But 
instead of traveling directly from one city to the next, the team will return 
to Northridge between games. All to save a few bucks on the costs of an extra 
night's lodging and meals. Class time is not a consideration because CSUN is on 
semester break. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the team will arrive home from Bakersfield in the early morning 
hours Friday. The Matadors will practice later in the morning before boarding 
the bus again for a 3-hour drive to San Luis Obispo. After staying the night 
Friday, the team will have a shoot-around at the Cal Poly gym Saturday morning, 
then rest until game time. They will return to Northridge immediately after 
Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Streaking Kingsmen: Steve deLaveaga cannot remember being more frustrated than 
he has been during the past 2 months during Cal Lutheran's 7-game basketball 
losing streak, which includes its first 3 games in Golden State Athletic 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say that the losing streak is not on my mind, but I would be 
lying," deLaveaga said. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga said that the Kingsmen's play has suffered because they are overly 
concerned about ending the losing skein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time now to put this aside and just play hard," deLaveaga said. "We are 
worrying so much about our shooting that it is affecting us." 
</P>
<P>
Some things never seem to change, however. DeLaveaga, Cal Lutheran's career 
scoring leader, is averaging 25.7 points a game to lead NAIA District 3 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Add Kingsmen: Cal Lutheran (6-11, 0-3) has a chance to improve its GSAC record 
to .500 during the next 2 weeks when it faces 3 of the conference's weakest 
teams. Azusa Pacific (0-3 in GSAC play), which plays host to the Kingsmen on 
Saturday, Point Loma and Christ College all have losing records along with Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Weak sister: Each CCAA men's basketball team plays a 14-game schedule -- a game 
at home and another on the road against 7 other conference schools. The format 
is designed to preclude any team having a schedule advantage over another. That 
is not always the case, however. 
</P>
<P>
The way the schedule is currently organized, each school ends up with what in 
effect is a partner. For example, while Northridge is playing at Bakersfield on 
Thursday, Cal State L. A. will be at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. On Saturday, 
CSUN will play at San Luis Obispo and CSLA travels to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The past 2 seasons, Northridge has been teamed with Cal State L. A. which, in 
the opinion of at least one CCAA coach, is not an enviable position. The Eagles 
were far and away the conference's worst team last season (0-14 in conference 
games, 2-23 overall) and seem well on their way to a similar record (0-1, 2-12 
so far) this season. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, opponents can spend more practice time preparing for CSUN than 
perhaps any other team. "It allows teams to focus in more on Northridge, no 
question," Coach John Masi of Riverside said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy was reluctant to comment on the situation other than to 
say, "If we had to play San Luis Obispo and Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo was 
down and not very good, 90% of our preparation would probably be for 
Bakersfield. I would think that would put Bakersfield at a great disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
Bad foot forward: Alan Fraser is listed as questionable for Northridge's 
basketball games this week. Fraser, a starting forward who is averaging 7.2 
points and 5.3 rebounds, sustained a sprained left ankle in a game at Cal 
Lutheran on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser practiced lightly Tuesday for the first time since incurring the injury, 
but Coach Pete Cassidy said that it has not been determined whether the 6-6 
senior will play tonight at Bakersfield. Northridge (10-4) has lost 2 of 3 
games that Fraser has missed this season. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Men's basketball teams from the CCAA have won 63 of 102 
nonconference basketball games this season, a .618 percentage. Of the CCAA's 8 
teams, only Cal State L. A. (2-11) has a losing nonconference record. Excluding 
the Eagles, conference teams are winning nonconference games at a .685 clip. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Logsdon, a senior point guard at Cal Lutheran, is shooting 93% from the 
free-throw line and ranks second in District 3. Logsdon, who has converted 30 
of 32 free throws, also leads the Kingsmen in assists with a 4.9 average. . . . 
CLU is second in District 3 in free-throw shooting at 73.5%. . . . Charles 
Jackson has scored 10 points in each of the past 2 games since being promoted 
to Cal Lutheran's starting lineup. The freshman out of Verbum Dei High has 
split time between center and forward. . . . Cal Lutheran has received only 10 
points from its starting forwards in the past 2 games. Loren Rodrick did not 
score against either Southern California College or Fresno Pacific, and both 
Rodrick and Blake Miraglia were held scoreless by Southern California College 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Collegiate pioneers: While Don MacLean is making a big splash at UCLA as a 
freshman, Shawn DeLaittre, the other half of the twosome that led Simi Valley 
High to the Southern Section 4-A Division championship last season, is waiting 
his turn. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre, a 6-foot, 5-inch swingman, is redshirting at Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo this season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MacLean leads the Bruins in scoring (20.8) and rebounding (8.4). 
Trevor Wilson, a junior from Cleveland High, is second in both categories for 
the Bruins, averaging 19 points and 8.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Football awards: The Glendale football banquet was held Tuesday and several 
players were honored. Mark McMillan, who had a team-high 42 tackles and 5 
interceptions, was named most valuable player. Other winners included: Sean 
Hampton (honorary offensive captain, offensive back of the year), Steve Heiber 
(honorary defensive captain, most inspirational), Doug Dragomer (most valuable 
freshman), Brian Kaloustian (receiver), Andres Washington (linebacker), Chris 
Allen (offensive lineman), Doug Bledsoe (defensive lineman), Geoff Thran 
(special teams), Tim Hull (coaches' award), and Rick Gomez (most improved). 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Guard Vicki Mallett of Northridge was selected CCAA women's 
basketball player of the week after scoring 20 points and adding 7 rebounds and 
7 assists in CSUN's 66-62 victory over Cal State Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy of errors: She can laugh about it know, but Leslie Milke, CSUN women's 
basketball coach, did not like what she saw in the last minute of the Lady 
Matadors' victory at Cal State L.A. in a CCAA opener. 
</P>
<P>
What she saw was her team unravel. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN was clinging to a 6-point lead with less than a minute left when it 
committed a pair of errors that could have proved costly. 
</P>
<P>
First, Bridgette Ealy handed, instead of passed, the ball to a teammate while 
taking it out of bounds in the backcourt. Cal State L. A. assumed possession. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on CSUN's next possession, Chris Cavalin was set to attempt a free throw 
when teammate CeCe Landsgaard was whistled for stepping into the key too early. 
The violation negated the free-throw opportunity and CSLA again took 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Northridge, the Golden Eagles didn't capitalize on their 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just nerves," Milke said. "We made a lot of crucial errors, and to 
still win after doing that, I'm pleased." 
</P>
<P>
And had CSUN lost? 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been horrible," Milke said. "That was a big game for us, the 
biggest of the year. It wasn't pretty, but at this point I don't really care." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 13-3 with the victory and is ranked 16th in this week's 
Division II rankings.

OXNARD BID FOR UPSET FALLS SHORT

<P>
Oxnard College Coach Remy McCarthy spent most of the second half of Wednesday 
night's game chastising the referees for making what he considered calls that 
favored Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's gone white, ref. Everything," McCarthy said, referring to 
Glendale's white uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
But when Condor guard Mike Price was ejected for squaring off with Glendale 
forward Alex Berry late in the game, the coach saw red and the Condors fell, 
73-69. 
</P>
<P>
Price, one of the top-scoring players in the Western State Conference, was held 
to 8 points before he was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 6, 60-54, the Condors staged a brief rally with less than 7 minutes 
to play. The 12-7 flurry began when Andy Beltowski grabbed an errant Glendale 
pass and drove the length of the court for the basket. Shortly after that, 
Randy Carter, who led Oxnard with 23 points, stole an inbound pass under the 
Condor basket and hit a short bank shot. 
</P>
<P>
Almost single-handedly, with about 2 minutes to play, reserve Vaquero center 
Jimmie Fowler short-circuited the Oxnard surge. He scored a layup, went back 
door for a slam and blocked 2 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, at 6 feet, 7 inches the tallest Glendale player, says that he is 
comfortable with his role as a spark plug for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the baseline dunk and we get to running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale players didn't need to do much running in the waning minutes, however. 
They spent a lot of their time at the free-throw line trying to cash in 
desperation fouls by Oxnard. But the game remained close when the Vaqueros 
missed 3 front-end free throws on 1-and-1 situations. 
</P>
<P>
Though forward Dave Swanson's shooting hand cooled in the stretch, he was on 
fire in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who took game-high honors with 25 points and 12 rebounds, scored 21 
points before the intermission -- including 5 3-point baskets. Swanson says 
that the Condors changed their defensive alignment at halftime to compensate 
for his hot hand. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Swanson scored just 4 points after that streak, Glendale 
Coach Brian Beauchemin said that was enough. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept us in the game," Beauchemin said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale guard Bruce Heicke scored 15 and Gary Fowler added 12.

The Moorpark College women's basketball team, playing without Kerrie Marshall, 
its leading scorer and rebounder, extended its Western State Conference winning 
streak to 20 games over the last 3 seasons with a 75-54 victory over College of 
the Canyons on Tuesday at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall left the team after a dispute with Coach Gary Abraham after she was 
late for practice Tuesday, according to Abraham. She was averaging 18 points 
and 8 rebounds a game to lead the Lady Raiders in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can pick up the slack with Kerrie gone," Abraham said. "It's no 
doubt a big loss for us." 
</P>
<P>
Susie Smiley scored 17 points to lead Moorpark (17-4, 5-0 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bittner added 13 and Kristie Sterbens had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tressie Millender scored a game-high 32 points to lead Canyons (3-12, 2-3).

INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The scene: GQ magazine's Tuesday night bash for January cover-boy Pat Riley at 
the grand opening of the China Club, 1600 N. Argyle Ave., Hollywood. The 
Lakers' coach-fashion plate-Chrysler Plymouth spokesmodel is as hotly sought a 
personality as his players these days. (But are we to believe those reports 
that he was up for the Kurt Russell role in "Tequila Sunrise" or is that an 
over-imaginative publicist's work?) 
</P>
<P>
The buzz: The night actually was three parties -- a GQ bash, a Riley salute and 
a peek at the China Club, expected to be one of Los Angeles' hottest '89 night 
spots. It's on the site of the old punk rock club Cathay de Grande, newly 
refurbished with blue walls, industrial gray carpets, Pirelli-rubber staircases 
and a handsome wooden bar. The place was so new it had the air of fresh paint. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: Riley; GQ editor-in-chief Art Cooper and publisher Michael 
Clinton; Sylvester Stallone and bodyguards; actress Dyan Cannon; mogul Michael 
Eisner; actor Treat Williams with Dana Delany; actress Teri Garr; actors Brian 
Dennehy, Scott Baio, Peter Scolari and Dean Stockwell; broadcast personality 
Wil Shriner; sportscaster Pat O'Brien; sportscaster-turned-KCBS anchorman Jim 
Lampley; singer Julie Brown. No Lakers players were visible. 
</P>
<P>
Justine Bateman watch: The party girl nonpareil was downstairs with that other 
party girl, Allee Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Dress mode: Anything went for women; natty suits for the men. A few guys had 
their hair slicked back, Riley style. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: Mucho mano-a-mano talk, most of it unprintable. "Check out the 
blonde. She wouldn't even talk to guys who make our kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: Dancing to good Motown. Dancing to awful '70s hits. Watching 
over-muscled bartenders do dizzying backhanded catches with the beer before 
opening it and forking it over. A live band, Boys Town, went on at 10 o'clock, 
but by then guests were heading out the door. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Nouvelle Chinese. Chicken on a stick, doughy things that were half 
potsticker, half knish; delicious beef ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Favors: GQ shopping bags with T-shirts and the January issue inside. Early 
arrivals got postage stamp-sized lapel pins, miniature replicas of the magazine 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The party buzz indicated that the China Club is a hit. The real test 
will come when another New York transplant club, B.C., opens soon. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: At times the action was faster and more furious than on the Forum 
hardwood. Full-court presses with drinks and lit cigarettes made circling the 
room tough, if not impossible. KEVIN ALLMAN

IRS WON'T BUDGE, SO IT'S YOUR MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've just received my degree in business administration and, as a 
result of a campus interview a few months ago, have been offered what seems 
like a very promising job in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that there was no mention by the company hiring me that it would 
pay my moving expenses from Southern California to Chicago. While I don't have 
a lot to move, I don't have any money either and am going to have to borrow 
from my folks to make the move. 
</P>
<P>
I know that there's some sort of arrangement under which a person can deduct 
his moving expenses if he's being relocated -- or has gotten a new job -- to 
another city and have inquired as to whether it applies to me. Most of the 
answers I get say no, just being a college graduate does not qualify me, 
because I don't really have the job yet, and so the Internal Revenue Service 
considers me a transient or an "independent contractor" or something like that. 
I still think I'm eligible, though. What do you think? -- W.W. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I think your new employer showed rare good judgment in picking you. 
Anyone as sensitive as you to the fine points of the Internal Revenue Code -- 
even before he or she is officially on the job -- is a pearl beyond price in 
the corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, according to Carol Shapiro, a public affairs spokesperson here for the 
IRS, your understanding of the moving deductibility for a college graduate is 
right on target. It also applies to someone returning to full-time work after a 
spell of unemployment, or to part-time employment, or to someone who -- for one 
reason or another -- has simply not been on anyone's payroll for a while. 
</P>
<P>
That "independent contractor" confusion has to do with people like doctors, 
lawyers and so forth -- predominantly self-employed -- who are simply moving to 
where they think the grass is greener. They, sure enough, can't deduct their 
moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In literally all respects, then, you've got the same deductibilities that the 
established worker has in taking a new job, or who is being relocated, but is 
responsible for his own move. In other words, you can deduct the full cost of 
moving your household goods -- and in traveling to the new job site. You can 
also deduct up to $3,000 in such indirect costs as making an advance 
house-hunting trip, in disposing of your old home (probably not applicable in 
your case) and in temporary living expenses while you're getting settled. 
</P>
<P>
The only proviso, the IRS' Shapiro says, is that the move has to see you 
working full time at least 39 weeks of the first year at the new job site. But 
even here it doesn't have to be continuous employment, nor with the company 
that hired you in the first place. You just have to stay settled in the general 
area for at least 39 weeks of full-time work. 
</P>
<P>
Good thinking. You've got a promising future. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that a sales tax frequently is payable in the states in which a 
product is made or sold, but every time I see a Franklin Mint magazine 
advertisement -- for a miniature car, a figurine or whatever -- the information 
about price is always accompanied by the instruction: "plus my state sales 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
Am I being overly suspicious in thinking it highly unlikely that the people at 
Franklin Mint actually turn over the money thus collected to the states from 
which the orders are received? -- D.L.H. 
</P>
<P>
A: My, you are cynical, aren't you? 
</P>
<P>
While he obviously can't speak for how the other 49 states do it, Jim Caldwell, 
administrator for the out-of-state district for the California Board of 
Equalization, assures us that California does, indeed, get its pound of flesh 
out of vendors operating in the state from an out-of-state base. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there are about 20,000 companies and individuals who keep their 
accounts outside the state and are registered to collect the California sales 
tax," Caldwell says. "And about 10,000 of these don't have any location at all 
within the state -- either operating entirely by mail or, possibly, through one 
or two sales reps located in the state." 
</P>
<P>
And, under Caldwell's direction, the state maintains a staff of auditors in New 
York City (25 auditors there alone), Chicago and Houston. Another 25 auditors 
operate out of Caldwell's Sacramento office and cover the Western states just 
as the New York staff covers the Eastern Seaboard -- including Pennsylvania, 
where theFranklin Mint is located. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts for all 20,000 vendors are audited at least every three years -- just 
as they are in California itself. 
</P>
<P>
And the Franklin Mint, you will be relieved to hear, has been registered -- and 
is in good standing -- with California since about 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Trust us: The tax collectors leave nothing to a vendor's good intentions.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: KEY FACTORS HELP ASCERTAIN DOLLAR VALUE OF PADLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a fairly large padlock collection. What are some of the more 
collectible names that would give some of these pieces a higher dollar value? 
-- F.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Company names that appear to attract a lot of collector interest 
include Wells Fargo, Winchester, Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co., Eagle Lock Co. and 
Miller Lock Co. 
</P>
<P>
Padlocks began being mass-produced in the United States in the middle of the 
19th Century; more than 150 such firms have been identified by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
American-made padlocks seem to be the most popular among collectors, even 
though padlocks had been manufactured in Europe for a couple of hundred years 
before appearing in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Iron and brass padlocks are considered among the most valuable. They should 
have company names on them to maintain their collectibility. 
</P>
<P>
Some collectors specialize in specific lock companies; others look for subject 
areas, such as railroad padlocks. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors say it's not necessarily important to have a padlock's original key, 
although this would enhance its value. But the padlock itself, they say, should 
be in reasonably good condition -- that is, relatively free of rust and cracks. 
</P>
<P>
Because valuable padlocks can carry price tags of $100 and up (although the 
beginning collector can find interesting padlocks for under $30), it's a good 
idea to have an expert authenticate the one you're interested in purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
Desmond Leigh-Hunt writes: "I have nearly 100 new-car brochures for American 
automobiles dating back to 1952. I know there must be people out there with 
cherished 25- and 30-year-old cars who would dearly love to have the sales 
brochure that was printed when their cars were new. I'd like to sell them if I 
could." Telephone: (805) 569-0741.

FOOTHILL TRANSIT ADDS 2 BUSES TO EASE CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price seems to be right for the more than 2,600 San Gabriel Valley bus 
riders using the Foothill Transit Zone's two daily commuter express lines. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong, and what zone officials are worried about, is that the same low 
fares that have attracted new riders have also left many people standing during 
the 45-minute ride to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased that it was overcrowded," said Foothill Vice President Judy 
Wright, who also acknowledged that the standing-room-only conditions may not be 
ideal from the rider's standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we wanted to respond to it immediately," she said. "We want (the 
ride) to be as comfortable as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The zone's executive board, made up of the mayors of four cities and a county 
representative, has authorized putting two spare buses into service on 
park-and-ride routes 495 and 498, which originate in the eastern San Gabriel 
Valley. The extra buses, which will bring the operating fleet up to 24, are 
scheduled to begin service next week. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Transit, formed by 20 San Gabriel Valley cities and the county, is 
intended to be a low-cost alternative to the RTD in the area. The transit zone 
contracts with private bus companies to provide service. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Southern California Rapid Transit District agreed to transfer 
14 routes to Foothill Transit over a two-year period, ending a dispute between 
the RTD and Los Angeles County Transportation Commission that had prevented 
Foothill Transit from operating. Foothill now operates only the two express 
lines but is scheduled to pick up six local lines by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission approved the zone's start-up in December, 1987, but 
implementation was blocked by legal challenges by the RTD and its drivers and 
mechanics unions. In the December agreement, the RTD dropped its opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be resolved is the challenge by the unions. The suit, which claims 
that the "privatized" system threatens union jobs, will be heard in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Ridership 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the RTD served a weekday average of 2,664 riders on routes 495 and 
498, said William P. Forsythe, Foothill's interim executive director. Since 
taking over the lines, the zone, which charges $10 less than RTD had charged 
for a monthly pass, has seen a marked increase in ridership, Forsythe said, 
although the agency does not yet have exact numbers. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, when the buses reach their last local stops, each of the 43 seats 
are taken and more than a dozen people jam the aisles, Forsythe said. The 
coaches carry a maximum of 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill President Don McMillen acknowledged that the agency's image could be 
hurt if riders got the impression that it gave cheap, but uncomfortable, rides. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen credited the cheaper fares and brand-new buses with attracting the 
increased ridership. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big factor," he said. "If you're going to save 50 cents a day, for a 
lot of people that adds up. Plus, our buses are pretty nice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the specter of the April legal challenge, Foothill officials plan to 
purchase buses for the next routes to be transferred from the RTD. The six 
local lines, to be transferred around July, will double the number of Foothill 
buses operating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Moving Right Along' 
</P>
<P>
"We still have got to have a favorable decision," McMillen said. "But the way 
it stands now, it kind of looks like we're moving right along." 
</P>
<P>
The bid packages from the bus companies for the new lines will be presented at 
the February meeting of Foothill Transit's five-member executive board. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Foothill directors are expected to make decisions on two 
housekeeping matters: permanent office space for the zone and the hiring of 
management staff. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont Mayor Wright said the decision on office space would likely be made 
sometime this week, with sites in West Covina and El Monte under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
For management, board members have indicated a preference for staying with zone 
architect Forsythe and his company, Forsythe and Associates Inc., as the first 
management firm to oversee operations.

CENTER FOR NEEDY WINS OK FOR SITE NEAR STORES

A divided City Council gave the green light Tuesday to a family counseling and 
food distribution facility to begin operation next to the downtown business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The council, on a 3-2 vote, rejected an appeal by two local merchants asking it 
to overturn the Planning Commission's earlier decision to grant a 
conditional-use permit for Unity Center. 
</P>
<P>
During more than two hours of testimony Tuesday night, about 13 residents, 
members of the clergy and community leaders urged the council to allow the 
Unity Center to start providing services immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Four business owners spoke against the center, arguing that it would be a 
magnet for transients. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Bartlett, who with Councilman John Nobrega supported the appeal 
against the conditional-use permit, said the location, at 148 E. Colorado 
Boulevard near Myrtle Avenue, the city's main retail commercial strip, is 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Operating entirely on donations and staffed by volunteers, the Unity Center 
provides food, clothing, vocational referrals and legal advice to about 14,000 
needy individuals from Monrovia and surrounding cities yearly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Housing 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old nonprofit agency has been temporarily housed at St. Luke's 
Episcopal Church on California Avenue since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
After several burglaries at the church, the center was ousted Aug. 1 from its 
original location at Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church. But Father 
John Foley, pastor, said at the time that the church needed more space for its 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
Immaculate Conception parish administrator Bob Sheehy told the Council on 
Tuesday that Unity had simply "outgrown the space they had" and that clients 
often spilled over into the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The center's new site was found through the Monrovia-Duarte Board of Realtors. 
The Realtors also donated 49,000 pounds of food and $6,000 in cash to Unity 
over the holiday season.

L&amp;C Better Homes and Gardens Realtors, a member of the Board of Realtors, 
has agreed to pick up the first year's rent of more than $6,000.

</P>
<P>
'Admirable' Work 
</P>
<P>
The Monrovia Planning Commission on Dec. 14 unanimously approved a 
conditional-use permit for the center to begin operation at the site despite 
opposition from 58 business owners who signed a petition that had been 
circulated by the Monrovia Downtown Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that what they do (at the center) is admirable," said 
David Gayman, one of the merchants who filed the appeal to the Planning 
Commission's approval. But "the Planning Commission ignored the concerns, fears 
of neighbors and retailers and chose instead to make a charitable decision." 
Gayman owns a hardware and variety store on Myrtle Avenue within a block of the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
He described the center as inappropriate in a retail area that already faces a 
"nagging problem" with transients. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in the retail business, we're always supersensitive about our image," he 
said. But he added that he has sometimes had to call police twice in the same 
day to deal with vagrants loitering outside his store. Customers are 
intimidated by panhandlers, and the transient clients Unity caters to would 
only worsen the situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't take the chance of losing any customers, yet we're supposed to accept 
(the center) and see if something doesn't go wrong in six months" when the 
permit expires. 
</P>
<P>
"I have too much invested in my business," said Richard Kee, the owner of a 
nearby photography studio who also appealed the Planning Commission's decision. 
He said he has observed eight to 10 transients who are already "regulars" in 
the area and who sometimes "stand there at midday urinating . . . in the 
bushes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Suggested 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a better site for the agency might be an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Unity Center Director Josephine Anderson, elated over the council's decision, 
said she had been frustrated by what she described as the business owners' 
misconceptions of center clients. More than 7,000 of her clients last year were 
children, according to Unity records. Only about 70 clients are listed as 
transients. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to feel we'll bring every derelict from 100 miles around," she said, 
adding that clients must be free from drug or alcohol abuse to receive help. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is set. The street people and the alcoholics know it. They must 
come clean," Anderson told the council. "I see us as part of the solution 
instead of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
To mitigate possible problems with vagrants, the Planning Commission in 
December ordered Unity to function primarily as an office, and to continue 
storing its food supply at St. Luke's. Only one day's supply of food for 
registered clients will be stored at the Colorado site. Food will be 
distributed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
While Unity will be open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, clients 
can enter by appointment only for services such as counseling or job placement. 
A waiting room will be provided and clients will be discouraged from loitering 
outside, Unity board members told the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oversight Committee 
</P>
<P>
An eight-member oversight committee representing business owners, residents and 
Unity board members will be formed to monitor the center's activity. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Glen Owens, in an interview before Tuesday's meeting, 
acknowledged that "there are a lot of problems involved, but (the center) was 
something we needed to keep alive. . . . It's one of those things that nobody 
wants in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will conduct a public review of the operation in three 
months and "if there are problems at that point, we can revoke (the permit) or 
put more restrictions on it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Everett Simson, rector of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, said he felt 
the business owners' fears were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand the people that are coming," he said. "I have been 
watching this for a couple of months, and they are mostly women and children. 
They're just families of Monrovia that are in trouble."

VIDEO EVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM COMBINES FILM RENTALS, AUTOMATIC TELLERS AND DRIVE-UP EASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the logical next step in cultural evolution. Perhaps it was only a 
matter of time before some enterprising types combined those two ubiquitous 
features of modern life, the video rental store and the automated bank teller 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Brown and Fred Di Giorgio have done just that. The two West Covina 
entrepreneurs unveiled the first Video-matic automated movie dispenser last 
week in a parking lot east of the Puente Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Di Giorgio, who have been in the video retailing business for about 
10 years, hit upon the Video-matic idea last year while trying to identify the 
next big trend in the movie rental trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It just came about as a natural next generation, you might say," Di Giorgio 
said. Brown "was looking at automated equipment and I was exploring a drive-up 
kiosk similar to Fotomat. We decided, 'Why not marry the best of both worlds?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holds 500 Cassettes 
</P>
<P>
The Video-matic prototype is a rectangular kiosk that takes up about three 
spaces in the average parking lot and holds 500 video cassettes locked in 
bulletproof plastic bins. 
</P>
<P>
On each side of the kiosk is an ATM-like device through which a customer slides 
a credit card. The customer then punches in the number of the bin containing 
the desired movie and -- once his or her credit is approved by a computer -- 
the bin automatically opens. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire transaction takes between 30 and 40 seconds," Di Giorgio said. 
</P>
<P>
To return movies, the process is reversed and the cost of the rentals is 
charged to the customer's credit card account. The machine can also issue cards 
that enable renters to receive a volume discount, a feature the Video-matic's 
creators hope will inspire customer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, automated video dispensers have existed for years in locations such 
as shopping malls, hotels and office buildings, while other companies have 
tried drive-through video stores with live sales clerks, said Judith Sawyer, 
editor of Video magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But Video-matic is the first attempt to join automation with drive-up 
convenience, Sawyer said. This, combined with a larger inventory of the most 
popular movies, should make the kiosks a hit with consumers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Drive-In Culture' 
</P>
<P>
"We are kind of a drive-in culture," Sawyer said by telephone from her New York 
office. "I would think that in a fast-paced area like L.A., it should be very 
popular, depending, of course, on whether there are any problems with the 
machines. . . . I think they should be able to give the video stores a run for 
their money." 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Di Giorgio said their creation is geared toward consumers who work 
too late to make it to the video store or who are too busy to wait in line at 
the rental counter. Films rent for $2.49 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Video-matic is stocked with several copies of the top 50 rental movies -- 
as determined by trade publications -- and new releases that have yet to make 
the charts. The average large video store stocks more than 2,000 titles. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives the customers what they want -- multiple copies of the top movies 
24 hours a day," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Film buffs seeking movies of earlier vintage will either have to brave the 
inside of a video store or settle for "Casual Sex" instead of "Casablanca." 
This is not a concern to the Video-matic's creators, who said they are willing 
to forgo that segment of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"About 80% of the revenue that comes into a video store is from new releases," 
Brown said. "In a video store, you simply keep collecting old movies." 
</P>
<P>
Movies that are no longer "hot" enough to command space in the kiosks will be 
sold to wholesalers, which supply small, independent video stores that cannot 
afford an entire inventory of brand-new films. Ironically, these are the types 
of businesses that are most likely to be squeezed out of the market by the new 
technology, Di Giorgio said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've studied our competition, and we feel that the super stores (large 
establishments with thousands of videos) have their niche and the music stores 
have their niche," he said. "We feel the market we will impact the most will be 
the mom-and-pop independently owned video store." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Moldsted, editor of Video Store magazine, said statistics on file at his 
Santa Ana office show that new releases account for only 53% of the rental 
revenue in a typical retail store. He believes video vending machines will 
serve a certain group of movie renters, but will not greatly change the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nod to Convenience' 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to drain the lifeblood out of the video store, but it's one of 
a persistent series of cuts," Moldsted said. "A good-sized video store with a 
large selection isn't going to have much to worry about. One of the great 
attributes of going to a video store is browsing for the title you want. The 
vending machine is strictly a nod to convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Moldsted said the concept of video vending machines has been around for years, 
but the idea was not practical at first because there weren't enough video 
cassette recorders in existence to create the necessary demand. With VCRs now 
in 60% of American homes, it is expected that by 1991, there will be 23,000 
video vending machines nationwide, according to Video Store magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening of the first Video-matic outlet in Industry last Friday drew 
about 100 people. However, most of them were not looking to rent movies, but 
rather were weighing whether to plunk down $150,000 for their own franchises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investors Check It Out 
</P>
<P>
While many of the prospective franchisees wanted to mull the idea over a bit, a 
few, such as Max Hall of Orange, were ready to take the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got a gold mine here," said Hall, who said he had been looking 
for a franchise business for some time and was attracted by the low maintenance 
required by an automated video outlet. "You don't have employees, so you don't 
have employee theft, which is a big part of the insurance (costs)." 
</P>
<P>
Most people interested in buying franchises are not high rollers, Brown said, 
but wage earners who want to own their own business without giving up a steady 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Potential buyers peppered Brown with questions, mostly about the risk of theft 
and vandalism to the machines. A key point of concern was that customers might 
return empty cassette boxes instead of the movies they had rented. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very smart machine," Brown assured them, noting that the kiosk contains 
scanners -- similar to those at grocery stores -- which read bar code labels 
attached to the cassettes. "If you try to put in no tape or a blank tape or 
another movie, it'll give you another chance. If you don't return (the genuine 
cassette) in five days, it'll bill you for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning to Vandals 
</P>
<P>
Although the kiosk contains no cash, it is equipped with a security system to 
discourage vandalism and theft. Anyone tampering with the kiosk is greeted by 
an Orwellian voice from an overhead speaker, warning the perpetrator that he 
has "violated a prohibited area" and that the police have been called. 
</P>
<P>
The two men said they envision Video-matic kiosks dotting parking lots 
throughout California and, perhaps, nationwide. "We're thinking we're the 
Fotomat of the '90s," Di Giorgio said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the idea catches on, imitation can't be far behind. To prevent 
this, the two men have secured a trademark on the Video-matic name and an 
exclusive agreement with the manufacturer of the ATM-video hybrid machine, 
Video International Vending Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Although this by no means precludes another company from getting into the 
automated video kiosk business, Brown said he is not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a market out there," he said. "It's really not a problem." 
</P>
<P>
But the same market force that led to Video-matic's creation -- the public's 
insatiable demand for the latest hit movies -- may lead to the demise of video 
as a medium, according to Tim Baskerville, president of Vidmar Inc., a 
Hollywood-based home entertainment market analysis firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with a hit product is that when it comes, there is a short supply 
and a very large demand and that demand is short-lived," Baskerville said. "For 
a few weeks, every copy of the movie is rented out every night. Then the demand 
drops off and the retailer is stuck with the cassettes." 
</P>
<P>
After peaking about 1991, videos will begin to be replaced as the top home 
entertainment medium by pay-per-view cable programming, Baskerville predicted, 
citing greater convenience for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to schlep to the store to rent or return a cassette," he said. 
Pay-per-view "is small now because only a few homes have the technology to 
receive it, but it's going to get bigger. . . . (Video) has certainly reached 
its peak in terms of growth rate and our view is that it may decrease in 
absolute terms as well. The bloom is definitely off the rose."

40 CANDIDATES LINE UP FOR LA CRESCENTA COUNCIL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a group of La Crescenta leaders talked about gaining some political clout 
for their community, they fretted over whether enough candidates could be 
roused to form a viable town council. 
</P>
<P>
At best, the leaders agreed, they needed 20 residents with enough interest in 
the idea to seek election to an 18-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Beauchamp, co-chairwoman of the town council formation steering 
committee, said she kept telling her fellow activists, "Don't worry about it, 
they'll come out of the walls." 
</P>
<P>
But even Beauchamp, who helped launch the idea of the council last summer, 
admits that she "was a little surprised" when a total of 40 candidates had 
stepped forward by last weekend to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly was not expecting that," said Beauchamp, a trustee of the Glendale 
Unified School District that serves the unincorporated county territory. "It 
shows there is a lot of support out there; people ready to serve when we need 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the candidates paid a $25 filing fee to seek election in one of three 
census tracts. Three council members and one alternate will be chosen to 
represent each of the tracts in an election March 9. 
</P>
<P>
While the council will have no real political power -- it will not be able to 
make or enforce laws -- it is expected to serve as the voice of the 20,000 
residents of the once-sleepy mountainside community nestled in unincorporated 
county territory between the cities of Glendale and La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Formation of the council was instigated by Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich -- who represents La Crescenta as part of his vast district -- in an 
effort to give residents more say in local issues. Population growth, housing 
density, traffic congestion, air pollution and crime are among regional issues 
that also affect the local community, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 registered voters will be eligible to participate in the 
election -- expected to cost about $1,000 -- which will be paid for entirely 
out of donated funds, Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Notices informing residents of the opportunity to file as candidates were 
mailed to more than 5,700 households. A tedious schedule of speaking 
engagements is planned for candidates as part of the grass-roots, 
get-out-the-vote campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates will be introduced at a public forum tonight at 7 at Crescenta 
Valley County Park, 3901 New York Ave. John Janecek, spokesman for the steering 
committee, said residents will be asked to express their concerns about the 
community and the issues they consider important. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Voting Places 
</P>
<P>
Beauchamp said ballots will be cast at four locations -- Crescenta Valley High 
School, Crescenta Valley and Montrose/Verdugo chambers of commerce and the 
Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Station. The steering committee also plans to send 
absentee ballots to voters who request them, Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the election will be tallied by hand by a group of volunteers from 
outside the town council territory. "We're hoping now that we get a good 
turnout," Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who answered the call to become candidates from several census tracts, 
generally between Pennsylvania Avenue and Ocean View Boulevard, are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Tract 3001, north of Orange Avenue: William C. Benning, Walter E. Burk, Bruce 
E. Campbell Jr., Nicholas A. Doom, Rick Drobner, Barbara Engelhardt, Betty A. 
Fitzgerald, Thomas M. Johnston, Jillayne D. Larson, Don Lawrie, Glynn B. 
Martin, Greta Pruitt, Lee Rooklin, Judy Tejeda, Eleanor Wacker and George E. 
Wadey. 
</P>
<P>
Tract 3002, between Foothill Boulevard and Orange: Charles K. Beatty, William 
Beavers, Rebecca M. Billington, Joseph Grosch, Katherine Hug, Margaret A. Klug, 
Ruth Knowlton, Debbi L. Meadows, Robert B. O'Neil, Bob Schell, Christopher R. 
Thomas and Larry Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Tract 3005, south of Foothill to Montrose and Honolulu avenues: Ann Marie 
Batesole, Brett Joseph Brauneisen, James Carl Gilchrist, Dave Hale, Lawrence E. 
Don Hogue, Anthony P. Hurtado, Jack Kashirsky, Larry Lousen, Sharon Martin, 
John A. Montanio, Fran Pehar and Daniel Joseph Rendler.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA; 
</P>
<P>
CITY VOTES TO SUE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted this week to file suit against the Three Valleys 
Municipal Water District, claiming that the district's board of directors 
violated the intent of an agreement to expand the board from five to seven 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Nymeyer, who made the motion to sue the water district, said 
city officials had been led to believe that a Pomona resident would be elected 
in June to represent the city along with current board member William Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board chose to have director Sandy Baldonado, a Claremont resident 
who represents a portion of east Pomona, represent north Pomona until her term 
expires in 1992. Because she would not be a resident of the newly drawn north 
Pomona division, Baldonado could not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Councilman C.L. (Clay) Bryant said he doubts that the city will 
actually sue because the board expansion agreement requires aggrieved member 
agencies of the water district to confer with the board before taking legal 
action. "I think we're going to be able to work this out amicably," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Janet Morningstar, who represented the city and two neighboring water 
districts during the preparation of the agreement with the water district, 
disagreed with Bryant's interpretation. The city is not required to meet with 
the water board before filing a lawsuit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Morningstar said the agreement does not expressly guarantee that a Pomona 
resident will be elected to the board in June.

SNAPSHOTS: DEMONSTRATING THE RAILROAD MAKES ITS CREATOR'S FACE LIGHT UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYBIL BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An adventuresome mouse would have the trip of a lifetime if it hopped aboard 
one of Monte Chambers' trains. The tracks run alongside Chambers's back-yard 
swimming pool in Glendora through an Austrian village, over a bridge, under a 
cable car, in and out of a tunnel, past a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
Everything to do with the railroad and its adjacent buildings, all from 
Germany, is done to scale. 
</P>
<P>
Every little window, light and rivet on the engine (where the wheel assembly is 
articulated to handle tight corners) is exactly the right size. The Sagewerk 
sign on the sawmill is in proportion to the building; at the Lowenbrau Zue 
Post, a little terrace features a tiny barbecue. The tiny porter outside the 
hotel pushes a baggage cart bearing tiny suitcases and an even tinier hatbox. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias and mammoth yellow pansies loom over the tracks, out of scale with 
the miniature railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Although some nurseries specialize in miniature plants for model train buffs, 
Chambers doesn't take his hobby to that extreme. 
</P>
<P>
If there are two broad categories of model train buffs -- the obsessed and the 
mellow -- Chambers is the latter. Describing the first category, Chambers' 
wife, Marilou, observes with a chuckle, "Some people even have the trains bring 
in their drinks at night." 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers' hobby is less all-encompassing. "I go in spurts. . . . Sometimes 
I don't run it for weeks at a time." 
</P>
<P>
And, Chambers admits, "I like to build 'em; I don't particularly like to play 
with 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Being laid back about it all seems to run in the family. The Chamberses have 
four grandchildren by their two daughters. Are the youngsters fascinated with 
the train? Not really, his expression indicates. "But they see it all the time. 
They like to show their friends, though," Chambers says. 
</P>
<P>
He is tall, lanky and laconic at 57, and a retired superintendent of heavy 
transmission lines for Southern California Edison Co. "You know, building those 
big steel towers across the desert," he says, describing his former job. He 
came a long way by staying put, and was able to retire early because he started 
early, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
He is a second-generation Californian; his father was born in Redlands in 1895. 
"And my mother lived here on this property. It was a big orange ranch," he 
says. He met his wife at Covina High School, and joined Edison after serving in 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
"Like most kids, I had a small electric train," he says. As an adult progressed 
to the HO model around the Christmas tree and eventually to the L.G.B. model in 
the back yard that he started assembling four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
L.G.B., which stands for Lehmann Gross-Bahn, (Lehmann Big Train in English) are 
sometimes called garden railways. L.G.B. is the last word in this hobbyist's 
train of thought. And he is not alone. The Los Angeles Garden Railway Society, 
where Chambers says "you can pick up some good ideas," has about 70 members, 
who write to the Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk in Nuremberg for their 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating the railroad's layout and explaining its features make its 
creator's face light up. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers uses seven engines and 30 cars in his pool-side railway. Four trains 
can run on the tracks simultaneously. The system is fully automated so that 
collisions are impossible. When one engine passes over a magnetized tie, it 
trips a switch that causes the arm of a signal to drop, and the next train to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give it 20 volts, it'll really move," Chambers said, "probably in 
excess of 100 m.p.h., in scale speed. The normal operating speed is 14 volts." 
</P>
<P>
The trains will run in rain or snow. At night, the headlights on the engines 
throw their beams. The windows of the hotel, the stations, the church and the 
farmhouses glow. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers assembles the buildings from kits made by Pola, another German 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, most people will lay out all their track first, then start adding 
buildings," Chambers says. He says he started with the hotel. "Then you start 
putting a farmhouse here, a church there, a this and a that." He ended up with 
14 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
L.G.B. engines can cost "from $160 to $600 apiece, and the cars from $30 to 
$200," he said. The building kits are usually a couple of hundred dollars each, 
also. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm better off than a lot of people just getting into it," he says, because 
"the dollar against the mark is so bad now." 
</P>
<P>
He learned some hydraulic engineering by installing the waterfall. And next 
year he wants to put a cog railway running up a slope. 
</P>
<P>
The rails -- solid brass, a good conductor of electricity -- feel warm in the 
sunlight. And in fact, the train "runs over a lizard now and then" that comes 
to bask, Chambers says. 
</P>
<P>
A more common hazard is corrosion. "You can develop bad joints, shorts," he 
said. But he added happily, "I enjoy fiddling with it."

COUNCIL SETS MEETING LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision literally made at the 11th hour, the City Council last week 
unanimously voted to set an 11 p.m. limit on its meetings. The meetings usually 
begin at 7 p.m. The vote on the motion coincidentally came at 11 p.m., eight 
minutes before the council adjourned the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have said they want to end meetings earlier to eliminate 
excessive rhetoric. In recent years, council meeting often have lasted until 2 
or 3 a.m. "You'd get so tired, you couldn't even keep your eyes open," said 
Mayor Barry L. Hatch, who proposed the time limit. "Often council members, 
including myself, get a little lengthy when we're talking."

COUNCIL OKS IMPACT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A final environmental impact report on commercial development at Las Tunas 
Drive and Rosemead Boulevard was unanimously approved for certification last 
week by the City Council acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the proposal to build a shopping center at the northwest corner of 
the intersection have said the document is incomplete because it lacks 
specifics, such as the types of businesses that will occupy the proposed 
center. 
</P>
<P>
If fully implemented, the complex will include 125,000 square feet of retail 
space, and yield an estimated $230,000 in sales tax annually, according to 
Parrington. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax increment is a significant economic factor that warrants the 
certification of the EIR," said City Manager Karl Koski. He said the added 
sales tax would make up 5% of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment project area was designated in 1972 to increase sales taxes 
in the city, which collects no property tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Passmore told the agency that a financial study should be prepared to 
determine how soon the city would get out of debt after implementing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The city is still making bond payments for the 1974 redevelopment of the K-mart 
shopping center on the southwest corner of the same intersection. The community 
development director, Robert Dawson, said those payments would end in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been discussing the new proposal with Long Beach-based Champion 
Development since May. The development agreement detailing financing and 
describing the major tenants of the shopping complex will be discussed at a 
regular City Council meeting Feb. 7.

ZARIAN BACKS OFF ON BUILDING EXEMPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being told by his colleagues that he would lose the vote, Glendale City 
Councilman Larry Zarian backed off from introducing an ordinance Tuesday to 
exempt 19 projects from the city's building moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian had said during a Jan. 6 council meeting that he wanted to exclude from 
the moratorium projects that were "90% done, a week or two away from final 
approval." 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, council members Jerold Milner, Ginger Bremberg and 
Mayor Carl Raggio indicated that they would not vote for exceptions to the 
building freeze while the city studies changes in the zoning code. Councilman 
John F. Day agreed with Zarian's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said he was disappointed by the outcome of the straw vote. He said the 
projects in question were unfairly delayed because overburdened city officials 
did not process the applications in time. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio and Bremberg said they would make all new projects comply with whatever 
zoning changes are approved. Milner, however, said he would consider granting 
exemptions during the council discussion of the proposed zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director John McKenna said he expects to have the draft zoning 
ordinance ready for the council's consideration by late February.

PLAN TO AID QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
6A committee appointed by Pasadena Mayor William Thomson to recommend ways the 
city can help victims of the earthquake in Armenia has proposed that the city 
sponsor a Pasadena Crusade for the Children of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
George Van Alstine, who headed the committee and is also chairman of the 
Pasadena Commission on Children and Youth, recommended that the city support a 
fund-raising effort to help children in Leninaken, a city of 200,000 that was 
badly damaged by the Dec. 7 earthquake. Artificial limbs and psychological 
counseling are needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors delayed action on the recommendation until Jan. 31 to 
coordinate plans with the Tournament of Roses Assn., which is also considering 
a fund-raising effort for earthquake victims.

9 MORE CANDIDATES ENTER FRAY; 
</P>
<P>
17 NOW IN GLENDALE COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The field of candidates for Glendale City Council swelled to 17 this week, 
setting the stage for what city officials believe is the most widely contested 
Glendale municipal election since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The roster of candidates more than doubled since Councilman John F. Day 
announced Jan. 9 that he will not run for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
His decision drew out candidates reluctant to run against a full slate of 
incumbents for the three available City Council posts. Two incumbents whose 
terms are expiring, Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg and Mayor Carl Raggio, are 
seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"If Day were in the race, I wouldn't be running," said sound technician Dan 
Leimeter, 47, one of nine candidates to file since last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'd run against Day," agreed publisher Richard Jutras, 49, who 
on Monday became the latest candidate to enter the race since the filing period 
opened Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Also joining the field were public relations executive Berdj Karapetian, 32; 
real estate broker Joe Ayvazi, 57; retired sheriff's deputy P.E. (Ed) Dorris, 
55; Glendale Police Officer Richard Navarro and landscape gardener Richard 
Seeley, 58. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period for the April 4 election closes Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Spokesman 
</P>
<P>
Karapetian is the paid spokesman for the Glendale Fair Growth Coalition, a 
developer group that opposes the city's moratorium on apartment construction. 
He is also the Western region chairman of the Armenian National Committee and a 
board member and spokesman for the committee's Earthquake Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Jutras is a one-time chairman of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce and a former 
member of both the Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals. He also 
chairs a chamber ad-hoc committee that is evaluating the city's proposed zoning 
changes to curb population density. 
</P>
<P>
Leimeter, Seeley and Dorris are newcomers to city politics and community 
activities. Navarro could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the field are eight candidates who filed for office earlier. They 
are Robin Westmiler, Shirley Yap Griffin, Vito Canella, Richard Diradourian, 
Doris Sink, Gary L. Siglar, Richard N. Matthews and Nida Solana Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Day endorsed Brown Friday, praising her as a candidate with a "new voice, new 
mind and new ideas to break a trend towards ignoring the people." 
</P>
<P>
Voters on April 4 will also fill three positions on both the school and 
community college boards. All six incumbents in those two races have filed for 
reelection, and so far there are no challengers. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Kurt Jon Erikson became the third candidate to file for city 
clerk. Aileen B. Boyle, acting city clerk, and Jeri A. Browne are the other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Elizabeth W. (Betty) Evans continues to be the sole candidate for 
city treasurer.

TALKS ON L.B. FREEWAY ROUTE HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Pasadena officials and Caltrans representatives have met to discuss 
alternatives to a state plan to complete the Long Beach Freeway through the 
middle of the city, but no agreements have been reached, participants said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides dismissed reports that Caltrans had agreed to a city-proposed 
compromise route that would bypass downtown, cut to the west and follow the 
city's western boundary line to the Arroyo Seco, the dry riverbed south of the 
Rose Bowl. Such a route is specifically prohibited by a 1975 act of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We have opened lines of communication," said City Manager John Bernardi. "We 
have ended the 'Cold War,' if you will, but certainly no decisions have been 
reached." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Torres 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi added that the proposal for a westerly route has the support of state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Torres will introduce legislation to permit 
construction of the freeway in the Arroyo Seco, Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans spokesman confirmed that agency officials from Sacramento were 
participating in the talks with South Pasadena Mayor James Woollacott, 
Councilman Sam Knowles and Bernardi. The spokesman said various westerly routes 
have been addressed in the state's environmental impact statement on the 
project, now being reviewed by the Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The city's latest proposal, however, was not addressed in the report. "It's 
kind of a brand-new thing," said senior environmental planner Cleave Govan.

Christmas decorations still glow nightly in downtown Delano. It's not that 
residents remain captivated by the holiday; it's just that the Chamber of 
Commerce does not have the money to store the decorations and pay for insurance 
coverage. Because of the lack of funds, the chamber's board voted against 
renewing a contract to have a Fresno-area firm store the green and red 
decorations. They have been plugged into city light poles since mid-November, 
and the lights turn on automatically every evening.

October, the opposition newspaper La Prensa and a Red Cross spokeswoman said. 
La Prensa reported that about 150 people gathered outside the warehouse in a 
poor neighborhood. Several youths then broke in and began tossing out boxes of

An ugly smudge is widening in the once clear, blue water of Lake Tahoe because 
of man-made pollution and acid rain, said a scientist who has studied the lake 
for 30 years. Charles Goldman, a limnologist -- one who examines the physical, 
chemical and biological properties of fresh water -- told the American Assn. 
for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Francisco that there is 
"irrefutable scientific evidence one of the world's cleanest, largest, 
loveliest lakes is deteriorating at a predictable rate." He said pollution has 
caused algae to grow 5.5% a year, resulting in an annual water transparency 
loss of 1 foot. The area's wildlife, economy and drinking water are also 
threatened, Goldman said.

Lebanese leaders of rival Christian and Muslim Cabinets have agreed to 
cooperate with the Arab League in a bid to prevent the formal partition of the 
nation, officials said. Acting Premier Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim Cabinet, 
said he will leave for Tunisia later this month for talks with a new committee 
of the 22-member league on ways of resolving the four-month political crisis 
that threatens to cement Lebanon's partition along sectarian lines. A political 
source in Christian East Beirut said that the army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel 
Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet, also "welcomed the Arab League's 
interest in the Lebanese situation and expressed readiness to cooperate with 
the committee."

A former Navy technician pleaded innocent in Norfolk, Va., to charges he tried 
to sell anti-submarine warfare secrets to the Soviets. U.S. District Judge 
Robert G. Doumar set an April 3 trial for Craig D. Kunkle, 39, of Virginia 
Beach, Va., who was arrested and charged with espionage Jan. 10 in an FBI 
sting. Kunkle said he wanted to become a Soviet spy for the money and to get 
back at the Navy, which discharged him for indecent exposure in 1985, the FBI 
said.

Oregon state corrections director Michael Francke was found stabbed to death 
near his office in what was "definitely a homicide," the state medical examiner 
said. State Police Supt. Emil Brandaw said there were no suspects in the 
slaying and his department offered unprecedented police protection to other 
state officials until more was known about the case. Francke, 42, who as head 
of corrections was charged with overseeing the largest prison expansion in 
state history in response to severe overcrowding, was found dead near his 
office on the grounds of the Oregon State Hospital in Salem.

A drug intended to stop the spread of the AIDS virus by mimicking the blood 
cells it usually infects has proven to be highly effective in experimental use 
on monkeys, experts report in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The 
animal research provides the first clear evidence outside the test tube that 
this strategy has a chance of slowing and perhaps arresting the disease in 
people. Even if the treatment works as well in people as it does in monkeys, it 
will not cure AIDS. But it might make life better for victims of the virus.

Housing Secretary-designate Jack Kemp pledged to "throw out ideology" and be an 
advocate for helping ease poverty, homelessness and other urban problems. Kemp 
won praise from big-city mayors in his first public appearance before them 
since his selection by President-elect Bush as secretary of housing and urban 
development. "I am going to be an activist," Kemp said. "I'm going to be an 
advocate. The door is open. My mind is open." He spoke to the U.S. Conference 
of Mayors as the group held its annual winter meeting in Washington.

EL SEGUNDO CITES HOTEL FOR 70 SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lengthy investigation by fire officials has uncovered more than 70 fire and 
safety code violations at the landmark Hacienda Hotel in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of the 640-room hotel -- most of which was built between 30 and 35 
years ago -- say they have already corrected many of the violations and have 
been working to comply with the city codes. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo Fire Department has ordered the hotel to respond to the findings 
by Monday and provide a timetable for correcting the problems, Fire Chief 
Robert Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider the hotel unsafe to occupy," Marsh said in an interview. "It 
is just that we have had mounting concerns over a long period of time over some 
areas we believe need to be updated." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the violations are highly technical and will be corrected when the 
hotel finishes installing sprinklers in all four of its buildings, Marsh said. 
The south and west towers already have sprinklers, and hotel managers say they 
expect to have sprinklers the other buildings by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Hacienda executives estimated that 30% of the 74 violations were corrected 
before the hotel was informed of the Fire Department's findings last month. 
They said the hotel is working on the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very confusing and frustrating situation for us because we don't 
understand why there is such a big push from the city when they know we are 
correcting all these concerns," said Frank Godoy, Hacienda's vice president and 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh said: "We want to have an organized plan to bring them into compliance. 
That's what we are really after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Violations 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 74 violations, the hotel was informed in November of about 
50 violations that investigators thought could be resolved quickly, such as too 
few fire extinguishers at some locations. Marsh said most of those violations 
have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Godoy said the city has known for some time that the hotel has been working to 
bring its buildings up to code. He said the hotel has been waiting for the city 
Planning Department to approve architectural plans aimed at correcting some of 
the problems. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, under a plan approved by city officials last year, the hotel has 
finished installing sprinklers in its west tower. The south tower has had 
sprinklers since it was built in 1979, and work will begin soon on the north 
tower and the main building, Godoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel officials and Marsh agreed that some of the violations are the result of 
hotel add-ons built over the years under different city codes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fair Amount of Problems' 
</P>
<P>
"Any hotel that that is 30-plus years old is going to have a fair amount of 
problems," Marsh said, "particularly if the hotel has been added onto and 
revamped over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh said fire officials do not classify the code violations as minor. Some 
will take significant structural work to correct, such as inadequate fire 
walls, faulty insulation around electrical wiring and several exits that need 
to be widened or relocated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some guest rooms are not equipped with proper smoke ventilation systems 
or fire-resistant doors, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Although violations were found in all four buildings at the Hacienda, more than 
30 were in the main building where the hotel's two restaurants and ballrooms 
are located, fire officials said.

HIRING DAY LABOR OFF STREET OUTLAWED IN REDONDO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contractors who hire day laborers off the streets of Redondo Beach will be 
subject to fines and possible imprisonment under a new ordinance adopted this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which becomes effective Feb. 16, broadens an existing ordinance 
that only penalized the largely immigrant workers who solicit employment on the 
street. Now, both employers and workers face fines of up to $1,000 and jail 
sentences of up to one year. 
</P>
<P>
"By making employers equally liable, the new law gives us a more effective 
means of dealing with the problem," said Redondo Beach Police Capt. Ray Graham. 
</P>
<P>
While the new ordinance covers all public streets and sidewalks in the city, 
its first application is expected to be along Artesia Boulevard in North 
Redondo, where immigrant workers have gathered for years to await job offers 
from cruising contractors. Merchants there have complained that customers are 
scared off when the workers congregate on the sidewalks outside their stores. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in adjacent Lawndale said Redondo's new ordinance will only push the 
job-seekers across the street into their city. Bart Swanson, Lawndale's public 
safety supervisor, said he gets "a lot of complaints" from property owners on 
Lawndale's side of the border at Inglewood Avenue and Artesia. He said he has 
seen as many as 120 workers gathered at or near the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
If law enforcement officers from one city show up, the workers often cross the 
street into the other jurisdiction, Swanson said. "They've gotten streetwise," 
he said. "It takes a coordinated effort to keep them from just moving back and 
forth." 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Lawndale adopted its own ordinance against soliciting jobs on 
the street, but it provides no penalties for employers. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Walter Lanier, commander of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lennox 
substation, which provides law enforcement for Lawndale, agreed that the new 
Redondo ordinance "could push the problem more into Lawndale." He said he plans 
to talk with Lawndale officials about bringing that city's ordinance in line 
with Redondo's. 
</P>
<P>
"We have worked with the Redondo police in the past and will continue to do 
so," Lanier said. He estimated that the cooperative effort led to more than 100 
arrests last year, but acknowledged that the job-seekers keep coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"When the numbers build up, we have a sweep operation," he said. "The activity 
dies down awhile, then slowly builds up again. As long as employers keep 
driving over there, the workers are going to continue to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, the Redondo police captain, said the city will use mailers, posters and 
other means to advise potential employers that it has become unlawful for them 
to hire workers who solicit jobs in the street. He said similar ordinances have 
been tested in the courts and found to be constitutional.

JUDGE DECIDES JURY CAN HEAR CLAIM AGAINST HUTTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury -- not an arbitration panel -- must decide whether Shearson Lehman 
Hutton violated federal securities laws in the way it handled investments of 
public funds by Lawndale and other government entities, a federal judge has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is a partial victory for Lawndale, which alleges in a lawsuit that 
it lost $1.6 million after its treasurer at the time, Ray Wood, placed city 
funds in a highly speculative investment handled by a Hutton broker. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton has declined to comment, except to say that the losses were caused by a 
decline in the bond market in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to recover the money, the city joined with several other 
government entities in filing a suit alleging, among other things, that the 
brokerage firm put public funds in risky securities and misrepresented the 
nature of the investment. Both actions were violations of federal law, 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Lawndale in the suit, filed a year ago in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, are the cities of San Marino and Palmdale, Palmdale's redevelopment 
agency, and the Three Valleys Municipal Water District in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Hutton asked the court to force the case into arbitration, which 
is more restrictive than the court system. Hutton noted that the investment 
agreements call for settling disputes out of court and prevent the cities and 
the other agencies from suing the brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale countered that former Treasurer Wood was not authorized to sign such 
an agreement, and that in any case, federal law at the time allowed such suits 
when a violation of federal law was alleged. 
</P>
<P>
In a 20-page ruling, issued Jan. 11, U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said 
an arbitration panel should decide whether the agreements were void but said 
the court should hear the allegation that federal laws were violated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted," said William Wynder, the plaintiffs' attorney, in an 
interview Wednesday. "It would be nice to have the case all in one forum so we 
don't have this dog-and-pony show twice . . . but we may end up getting two 
bites of the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Hutton attorney Stephen Young said his client was studying the judge's decision 
to determine whether it can be appealed and, if so, whether to do so. A hearing 
is scheduled Feb. 16 to determine how the trial should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Although a major portion of the case is now expected to be tried in court, 
Young did not view the ruling as a setback for Hutton. He said Hutton is 
convinced that it not only will win in the arbitration matter, but will prevail 
in federal court as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best analogy is that we asked for a whole loaf of bread, and we 
got a half loaf of bread," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which seeks $8.4 million in compensatory damages and $16 million 
in punitive damages, accuses two brokerage companies, Hutton and First 
Investment Securities Inc., and six brokers of violating federal and state 
securities laws. Among the brokers is William E. Parodi Sr., who worked for 
Hutton when he approached the plaintiffs with the investment proposals. Parodi 
has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was fired from his Lawndale job after the losses were discovered. He is 
not involved in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Rymer's ruling, Lawndale City Councilwoman Carol Norman said 
Wednesday that "any favorable ruling is obviously something that will thrill 
all of us in Lawndale." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.6 million that the city claims to have lost represented about half of 
its reserve fund. "Lawndale is just a small city, and that is a considerable 
amount of money," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Wynder said that turning the entire dispute over to an arbitrator 
could have hurt the plaintiffs. Under the arbitration system commonly used to 
settle disputes between brokers and clients, the case would be heard by five 
people: three representatives of the public and two with some connection to the 
brokerage community. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a court decision, the arbitration panel's decision could not be appealed 
on issues of fact, and there would be no written record of the proceeding. 
Also, fact-finding procedures are more limited in arbitration than in a court 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Wynder and Lawndale's city attorney, David Aleshire, say the FBI and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Hutton's handling of the 
investments. Those agencies have declined to comment.

VETERAN COUNCILMAN RECOVERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Redondo Beach Councilman Archie Snow is undergoing treatment for heart 
ailments at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Snow was admitted Jan. 4 after suffering a mild heart 
attack. An angioplasty was performed to clear a partly blocked artery, they 
said, and further tests were ordered Jan. 11 when the 70-year-old councilman 
began to experience disturbances in his heart rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who is a mayoral candidate in the March 7 elections, was described in a 
press release Tuesday as "fully alert and conversational (and) anxious to get 
back to work." He has missed the last two City Council meetings as a result of 
his illness.

TOWNHOUSE LOTTERY DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing failure to run a required legal notice, Rancho Palos Verdes and E. S. 
Development postponed for two weeks a lottery for 10 so-called affordable 
townhouses in the 49-unit Villa Capri development. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing, originally scheduled for last Monday, will be held Jan. 30 at 6 
p.m. at Hesse Park, 29301 Hawthorne Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for applying for the units -- with more than 2,100 people already 
in the running -- has been extended through Wednesday. Lottery numbers already 
assigned to contenders remain the same, according to the city. Applicants need 
not be present at the drawing. Priority is being given to Rancho Palos Verdes 
residents with annual incomes of about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
The "affordable" units sell for $140,000, while the remaining units are going 
for more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Pitcher, city public information officer, said the lottery was postponed 
by the developer after it was discovered that the required legal notice of the 
affordable housing agreement with the city had not been published. She said the 
notice is necessary to protect the city and developer from a legal challenge to 
the affordable housing program, which the city required when it approved the 
development more than two years ago.

APPOINTMENT FOR HOTEL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to speed planning for a proposed luxury hotel at the defunct 
Marineland in Rancho Palos Verdes, John E. Corcoran, 45, has been named vice 
president for development of the Monaghan Co., which purchased the 102-acre 
seaside property in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran, who was general manager of Marineland when it closed, has been a 
consultant on the project since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
The city in November sent back two envelopes of documents to Arizona-based 
developer James Monaghan, complaining of delays and missed deadlines in the 
hotel planning process. The city invited Monaghan to submit complete 
applications later. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran said his new position gives him "authority . . . to head up the 
project and make decisions. . . . Part of this is to speed up the project and 
coordinate all different design phases." 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran declined, however, to predict when a completed project and application 
package will be given to the city.

2 SHOWS SHARE BILL BUT FAIL TO ADD UP TO MUCH AT WELK RESORT THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"George M!," a musical ode to the late showman George Michael Cohan, is the 
kind of musical that the "Yankee Doodle Dandy" himself would have liked -- not 
too deep, but with lots of dancing, singing and vaudevillian shtick gliding on 
the surface like an emotional Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
Does the hero need a few tears to make him even more lovable? Let's have his 
wife leave him, for the "crime" of being a workaholic. In a celebratory scene 
of theater success, he shows his generosity by signing over half of his 
royalties to his father, while the next Mrs. Cohan-to-be stares at him with 
adoring goo-goo eyes. 
</P>
<P>
If Cohan would have liked the script, he certainly would have loved the songs, 
a winning score culled from the many hits he wrote: "Yankee Doodle Dandy," 
"Over There," "Give My Regards to Broadway," "Mary" and "You're a Grand Old 
Flag." 
</P>
<P>
But the show itself, which plays at the Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre through 
March 11, teases rather than pleases with intimations of the complex man behind 
the simplicity of his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Who was this George M. Cohan, really? Only a brief, careful outline of facts is 
revealed in this tribute. He was born into a vaudevillian family at the turn of 
the century, by the age of 9 stepped into the act of "The Four Cohans," by 23 
had expanded his first vaudeville sketch into a Broadway musical, and, by 26, 
had scored the first of what would turn out to be dozens of Broadway hits that 
later earned him a reputation as the father of American musical comedy theater. 
</P>
<P>
He did end up outliving his popularity, however. His last four shows, all of 
which he starred in, were failures. And, despite the lingering popularity of 
his songs, few of his musicals are ever revived. 
</P>
<P>
Just as audiences in Cohan's later years expected more sophistication from the 
impresario than he was able to give, it is hard to imagine the modern audience 
that wouldn't find "George M!," which played Broadway in 1968, lacking. Forget 
psychological complexity. This play not only doesn't have answers, it hasn't 
even figured out there are questions. 
</P>
<P>
Why was Cohan so driven to create songs and musicals? Because he desperately 
needed to rescue his family's act from being hopelessly mediocre? Where did his 
tremendous confidence come from that allowed him to be bashed by critics year 
after year and still know -- until near the end -- how to give the public what 
they wanted? 
</P>
<P>
And did he lie about his birthday (July 3 instead of July 4) simply to pass 
himself off as the Yankee Doodle Boy born on Independence Day? Was the source 
of all the patriotism that inspired his flag-waving songs and routines the real 
thing, or were they done for effect because he knew what would sell? 
</P>
<P>
And where and when was the child born who helped compile and revise this 
material? Poignantly, that daughter, Mary Cohan, must have realized herself 
that she didn't fit into a neat picture frame when she omitted herself from the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
One thing a consummate showman like Cohan wouldn't have liked is the Welk 
sending in a nearly inaudible understudy as Cohan's first wife at the Sunday 
matinee, with a script in hand, without so much as an apology or a pre-show 
warning of how unprepared the understudy would be. 
</P>
<P>
With all that pitted against it, the show still nearly redeems itself by 
presenting an opportunity to hear those highly hummable Cohan melodies one more 
time. Donn Simione as Cohan, Sherri Sperling Bannister as Cohan's sister, 
Josie, and Suzan Meier as Broadway star Fay Templeton, all deliver vocally. 
Randy Doney ages gracefully as Cohan's father, Jerry, the older vaudevillian, 
and Cynthia Gray is lovely and appealing as the actress Cohan hired who got 
recast as his wife. 
</P>
<P>
If Rob Barron's direction isn't deep, his choreography is deft and Simione and 
Bannister, in particular, tap dance in style. The mystery of this production is 
why such rich raw material could not have generated a more satisfying show. 
</P>
<P>
Performances at 8 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday -- Saturday with matinees at 1:45 
Tuesday -- Thursday and Sunday at 8860 Lawrence Welk Drive, Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Catch Me If You Can," which alternates with "George M!" at the Lawrence Welk 
through Feb. 18, is a mystery of another sort -- a whodunit that aspires to run 
in the tradition of "Sleuth" and "Deathtrap." 
</P>
<P>
A man's wife disappears on their honeymoon. A priest returns the wife only to 
have the man declare, horrified, that the woman isn't his wife and is only 
posing in the part to kill him and get his insurance money. Can the man get 
Inspector Levine to believe him? Can the woman get the inspector to believe 
her? And will poor Sidney, who delivers sandwiches to this quarrelsome couple, 
end up looking like one of his own Swiss cheeses with a little bit of catsup on 
the side? 
</P>
<P>
No more hints -- as those who guess the killer correctly during intermission 
are in the running to win a golfing weekend at the Welk. 
</P>
<P>
There are more holes in the plot than in that very same golf course, but none 
that couldn't be danced over by a nimble-enough cast. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the actors here lack chemistry, with the strongest 
characterizations, alas, falling to the bit players. The play cries out for 
larger-than-life star turns, but Harold MacPherson Jr. does the best with a 
dandy Jack Gilford-like interpretation of Sidney the sandwich man, and Fred 
Bailey finishes a strong second with his suspiciously beatific Irish priest. 
</P>
<P>
The usually exquisite Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds had a chance to smolder here as 
the wife, in Kathleen ("Body Heat") Turner style; instead, she maintains a cool 
aloofness as if she'd rather be someplace else. Nonnie Vishner as Inspector 
Levine could use more Detective Columbo in his homey delivery. As the man who's 
seeking his missing wife, John Shull pours on the anxiety but without a sense 
of inner direction that would make the portrayal memorable. 
</P>
<P>
All of which makes the lingering question not whodunit, but why couldn't they 
have dunit better? 
</P>
<P>
Performances at 8 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Sunday with matinees at 1:45 p.m. 
Monday, Friday and Saturday at 8860 Lawrence Welk Drive, Escondido.

STAGE WATCH : LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE EXPANDS SEASON TO 6 PLAYS; ACTRESS ALMOST HAD 
TO FLY 'ROAD TO MECCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse is flexing its muscles. 
</P>
<P>
A summer season expanded to six shows, lengthened by a month and consisting of 
an import, two new plays, a Shakespeare, a new musical and a classic comedy, is 
what artistic director Des McAnuff is promising audiences for his seventh year 
at the controls of the revived and revitalized theater on the UC San Diego 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
To kick off the season in the Mandell Weiss Theatre May 14-June 17, McAnuff is 
importing Chicago's much-lauded Steppenwolf Theatre Company, the home of such 
actors as John Malkovich and Joan Allen. The group will bring a revised version 
of its staging of John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath." Adapter-director 
Frank Galati will restage it in La Jolla after a full rehearsal period with the 
35-member cast. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really consider this an import," McAnuff said. "It will be very much a 
new version or second step in the development of the production. The cast will 
change somewhat. It's an important piece. We've shared projects with other 
companies before." (He cited the 1986 collaboration with the American National 
Theatre over the production of "Ajax.") 
</P>
<P>
"We have close friends in the (Steppenwolf) company," McAnuff continued. "It's 
an opportunity to collaborate. (The Mandell Weiss) should be a terrific stage 
for this epic production. And (the play) has so much to do with the history of 
California -- even current history in this day of the homeless and of migrant 
farm workers." 
</P>
<P>
Following its La Jolla engagement, "Grapes of Wrath" is going to Britain's 
National Theatre (June 22-July 1). "This is the production London will see," 
McAnuff said. "It's the National Theatre that will really be importing it." 
</P>
<P>
The second La Jolla staging will be of a new piece by Keith Reddin called 
"Nebraska," described in a press release as "a contemporary tale of men and 
women on a Strategic Air Command missile base . . . the kind of place where 
there may be love in the afternoon and Armageddon in the air." 
</P>
<P>
"Nebraska" sets up residence at the Warren Theatre June 25-July 30, followed by 
a new play commissioned from Lee Blessing (who wrote "A Walk in the Woods" and 
"Two Rooms," both staged earlier at La Jolla), which will take up the fourth 
season slot, Aug. 13-Sept. 17, also at the Warren. This new drama, titled "Down 
the Road," deals with the compulsions of a serial killer, and, like the 
previous Blessing plays, will be directed by McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
For his Shakespeare this year, McAnuff will tackle "Macbeth," Shakespeare's 
so-called unlucky play. It will cap the season in the Mandell Weiss Oct. 
25-Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a version of it six years ago at Stratford (Ontario)," he said, "and the 
imagery has haunted me since. The play is bottomless. I'm very interested in 
the whole notion of a childless couple where the husband's career becomes the 
child. Being 36 now and not having a child, I relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
"Macbeth," McAnuff believes, "is a domestic tragedy, a keeping up with the 
Joneses tragedy, sandwiched between two great battles." For him, it evokes 
connections with the John Kennedy assassination, "a festering wound that won't 
heal because you can never get to the truth. How one event, the murder of 
Duncan, can bring eternal darkness to a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be announced are the new musical and the classic comedy that will 
complete the season. The new musical, McAnuff said, "will continue an important 
tradition here," noting in passing that last season's new musical, "Around the 
World in Eighty Days," is still humming on a back burner. ("We're reworking the 
book," he said, "and will probably workshop it once more.") 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to move forward with real conviction," he concluded. 
"Construction begins in less than 60 days on the new theater," he added, 
talking about the 350-seat Studio Theatre, for which major plans were outlined 
last year. "It will be ready for the 1990 season, when we'll be expanding our 
production schedule again." 
</P>
<P>
GOING IN STYLE: Nan Martin, who plays Miss Helen in the South Coast Repertory 
production of "The Road to Mecca" in Costa Mesa, almost ran afoul of some 
delayed Hollywood scheduling when the much-postponed shooting schedule of a 
two-hour "Columbo" TV movie she had begun working on in November clashed with 
"Mecca's" opening last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was trapped by commitments to be in two places at once. Telling studio 
officials that she couldn't miss her theater opening cut no ice. They cited 
their need to protect their $3-million investment. Angry words were traded and 
Martin issued an ultimatum: At 6 p.m. she would walk off the set and be flown 
to Costa Mesa at her own expense by helicopter, whether the studio approved or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
The producers made it clear they wouldn't approve -- not unless the daily shoot 
was through. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Martin's husband, Harry Gefner, in charge of the wrangling, "Columbo" 
producer Stan Kallis is "an old friend" and sanity -- or friendship -- 
ultimately prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was released at 5 p.m. last Thursday and at 5:30 p.m. the next day, 
Friday -- in time to call off the helicopter and drive to South Coast Rep for 
her 8 p.m. show. So all's well that ends well or, as they say in these parts, 
that's Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE OUTS AGAIN: Charles Marowitz, associate director in charge of dramaturgy 
for the Los Angeles Theatre Center, and editor of its newsletter, Alarums &amp; 
Excursions, has resigned in a clash with LATC artistic producing director Bill 
Bushnell. Marowitz attributed his resignation to Bushnell's interference with 
"contractually delegated" aspects of the theater operation. 
</P>
<P>
This translates to a dispute over the composition of a panel for a symposium 
titled "State of the Art" examining the Los Angeles theater from an 
international perspective. Bushnell objected to Marowitz's all-Caucasian 
selection of panelists. "I don't see how you can discuss the 21st Century in 
theater," Bushnell said, "without including an ethnic mix of people." 
</P>
<P>
The symposium is expected to go on as scheduled Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
'SYMPATHY' FOR ATLAS: The transfer of Burbank Theatre Guild's staging of 
"Sympathy" to the Matrix Theatre on Wednesday was derailed by the ongoing 
dispute between Actors' Equity and ATLAS, the organization of theater operators 
opposed to the union's new 99-Seat Plan. The Guild, a hotbed of sympathy for 
ATLAS, is trying to decide how to do the show without using Equity's plan. 
</P>
<P>
THE BIG DEFECTION?: Are the LAPD (Los Angeles Poverty Dept.) and the Actors 
Gang defecting to San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
The two ensemble groups are merely opening their newest productions there at 
the invitation of San Francisco's Intersection for the Arts, which is 
presenting a month of theater from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Intersection's Margaret Crane, the LAPD will be in residence 
with a new piece called "Jupiter 35" on Feb. 1-11 and the Gang will follow with 
"The Big Show" on Feb. 15-25. 
</P>
<P>
"(We're opening up there) strictly because of the time factor," said Gang 
member Mark Seldis by way of reassurance. "The Big Show," which is a depiction 
of Central American/Northern American relations in the format of a game show, 
"wouldn't be ready to open here first," Seldis said. "We'll come back, take a 
month or so to restage it and then do it down here." 
</P>
<P>
LAPD's "Jupiter 35" is a true story about a member of the company waking up one 
morning at County-USC Medical Center with a new name, to find out (eventually) 
that he was thrown out of a window in Skid Row. "It 's about his recuperation 
and the unraveling of what happened," said artistic director John Malpede, 
explaining that the piece, which will also be done in Los Angeles later this 
spring, is still in development. 
</P>
<P>
NEW SHINGLE: The Company of Angels, dispossessed by an arson fire that stormed 
through its Waring Avenue theater in Hollywood last April, has finally found a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The new address for this 28-year-old Los Angeles membership company is the 
former Frog Pond Restaurant at 2106 Hyperion Ave. in Silver Lake. The new 
quarters expect to accommodate about 70 seats in about 2,000 square feet of 
space when the new Angels Theatre opens in a couple of months. Short-term 
production plans include the world premiere of Sandy Clarke's "Looking for the 
North Star" and a revival of Clifford Odets" "Waiting for Lefty."

POGORELICH PIANO RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keyboard gymnastics are nice, but in the great Romantic literature a musically 
more pertinent issue is definition of texture and color. That at least was a 
lesson emphatically taught by Ivo Pogorelich in his piano recital at Ambassador 
Auditorium on Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Not, understand, that the young Yugoslav does not have a full virtuoso measure 
of speed and power. Whether in sudden gusts or sustained, implacable storms, he 
produced rafter-ringing sound at any speed, in single notes or massive blocks. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his intense concentration and fierce control that separated 
Pogorelich's playing of the Opus 79 Rhapsodies by Brahms, Liszt's Sonata in B 
minor, and Chopin's Opus 28 Preludes from the usual barn-storming standard. 
Pogorelich is a keyboard logician and sculptor, as well as a poet and stunt 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Sharply etched clarity was immediately apparent in the opening of the B-minor 
Rhapsody, a piece that also established Pogorelich's claim to the farthest 
reaches of the dynamic spectrum. It was the G-minor Rhapsody, however, in which 
his rigorous control of momentum took firm hold. He produced an astounding 
effect of barely contained energy, leading to a cumulative climax of much 
greater strength than anything more impetuous or stereotypically Romantic could 
have achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Pogorelich's mastery of texture served Chopin in good stead, and his sure sense 
of musical direction almost condensed the full 24 Preludes into one epic piece. 
At times, Pogorelich's Chopin could sound calculated, but his logic was so 
irrefutable, it had an emotional fervor all its own. 
</P>
<P>
In Liszt's Sonata, Pogorelich clarified texture with almost brutal 
effectiveness, building a towering monument layer by layer. His view was 
expansive in scope, compressed in emotion and utterly commanding in execution. 
</P>
<P>
At the most extreme moments throughout the program, snarling basses overwhelmed 
Pogorelich's right hand. Whether it was a question of interpretive exaggeration 
or a piano pushed to its limits was not clear, but Pogorelich's formidably 
regulated resources banished any thought that it might have been due to 
inadvertent manual imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
From the widespread, savagely hacking coughing that assaulted portions of the 
Liszt, one might imagine that Pogorelich failed to reach his audience. Applause 
was vociferous, however, and ultimately elicited a lone encore from the 
obviously tired pianist -- a highly Chopinesque account of Scriabin's Poeme, 
Opus 32, No. 1.

NAVY FIRES VOLLEY AT $2-BILLION ORMOND BEACH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently released Navy report strongly criticizes a proposed $2-billion 
development on Oxnard's Ormond Beach for its proximity to runways at the 
Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which was presented Saturday to a citizens advisory group reviewing 
Oxnard's general plan, said that base flight operations would pose significant 
safety and noise hazards for residents of the 2,900-acre, marina-oriented 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials fear that residents' complaints could lead to calls to close the 
base, whose facilities are characterized in the report as "unparalleled and 
unduplicable in the United States, if not the world." 
</P>
<P>
"When you have noise complaints, people start to organize to try to close down 
the base," base spokesman Ray Lucasey said. "History has shown this." 
</P>
<P>
If the base were to leave Ventura County it would take 16,000 jobs and $590 
million in payroll and business contracts with it, the report said. Relocating 
the base would cost the federal government $700 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A vice president for the Baldwin Co. of Irvine, the project's developer, called 
the Navy's objections alarmist. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the Ormond Beach marina plan as at all inconsistent with Point 
Mugu," Jim Harter said. "We'd be providing housing and recreational 
opportunities for people who work there and commercial structures for 
businesses that do business with the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials stressed that the report is advisory only. They said they have 
been meeting with Baldwin and city officials to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The development, which would include 10,500 homes and a 1,600-slip marina, must 
go through many city and county reviews before it is approved. One big hurdle 
is Oxnard's General Plan Advisory Committee, which will recommend how Ormond 
Beach should be developed in its revision of the city's general plan. The 
committee is scheduled to discuss the Navy's arguments today. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sympathize with Mugu," said Stewart Mimm, a committee member. "The 
aircraft would be flying as close or closer to homes than at the Oxnard 
Airport, which is a pussycat compared to Mugu. This is a threat of a tiger." 
</P>
<P>
The southeast corner of the development would come within a quarter-mile of a 
runway at the base, whose aircraft operations make for "the most complex 
airspace operated by the Navy," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 acres of the development would fall within an "accident potential 
zone," in which the U.S. Department of Defense forbids any construction, the 
report said. Another 884 acres would be in an area where state and federal 
guidelines discourage residential development because of airplane noise, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that the development's marina would "dramatically increase" the 
number of leisure boats near the center's sea test range, where the Navy 
conducts about 10,000 missile operations annually. 
</P>
<P>
These operations "pose significant life-safety risk to boaters errantly 
entering" the area, where access is restricted by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that development could degrade wetlands in the area and 
contribute to beach erosion, a longstanding problem. 
</P>
<P>
But Harter disagreed. He said the development could actually improve the 
wetlands by removing from production agricultural lands that have been draining 
pesticides into the wetlands. The plan urges the phasing out of much heavy 
industrial activity along Ormond Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether the marina would increase the number of boaters exposed 
to the base's dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Harter said that boating activities are expected to increase in the county even 
if the development is not built and that boaters are discouraged from entering 
the 35,000-square-mile sea test range by clearly marked designations on all 
nautical maps. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the Navy's objections about the development's potential for noise 
and safety hazards. Harter said that only roads and open spaces would be built 
in the "accident-potential zone." 
</P>
<P>
Harter added that Baldwin questions the accuracy of the Navy's noise 
measurements around the airport. He said a noise consultant hired by the 
company had traced excessive noise to jets operating at a higher than necessary 
power level. He also pointed to the Navy's own plans to re-assess noise levels 
around the airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go through the detailed studies required of all developments, I think 
the solutions to all the concerns will become evident," Harter said.

PLAN TO FILL POTRERO CANYON MAY COST EXTRA $2.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An effort to halt dangerous landslides in Potrero Canyon by filling it with 1 
million cubic yards of dirt and topping it off with a public park could be far 
more expensive -- and take longer -- than Los Angeles city officials predicted 
a year ago, according to a new report on the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, said this week that he 
remains committed to the controversial undertaking, which officials hope will 
bring an end to costly lawsuits brought against the city because of the 
landslides. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already paid about $8 million to settle suits by nearby Pacific 
Palisades property owners, who claim that water from city storm drains has 
undermined homes, destabilized the canyon's walls and caused landslides. When 
the project is completed, about 75 feet of the 150- to 250-foot-deep canyon 
will be filled. 
</P>
<P>
"This project has to go forward," Braude said in an interview Tuesday. "We have 
an obligation to protect the sides of the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
A recent report to the Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners, which 
oversees work at the 60-acre canyon, warned that "based on current costs it can 
be assumed that the department is facing a major addition" to a $4.2-million 
contract for Phase 1 of the three-phase project. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 1, which began last March, involves installing a storm-drain system to 
carry rainwater to Will Rogers State Beach. Cost overruns -- including $500,000 
to remove soil contaminated by leaking underground gasoline tanks -- have 
forced the department to divert funds intended for the design, inspection and 
construction of the two other phases, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 2 calls for the actual filling of the canyon, and Phase 3 involves 
development of a park and restoration of the Potrero Canyon stream on top of 
the fill. 
</P>
<P>
Based on recommendations in the report, the board voted Friday to ask the City 
Council for $4 million for the project -- raising its estimated cost from $7 
million to $9.5 million, according to Kathleen Chan, the project's manager and 
author of the report. The City Council has already appropriated $3.5 million 
for the project, and the Department of Recreation and Parks has contributed 
about $2 million of its own, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that is not used will be returned," Chan said in an interview. "I am 
trying to avoid having to go back to the City Council and asking for money 
again. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delay in Completion 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is likely that work will continue well past the February, 1990, 
deadline set by the California Coastal Commission when it approved the project 
in 1987. Although she was unable to predict a completion date, Chan said winter 
rains and everyday storm-drain runoff into the canyon have "virtually stopped 
construction" on the storm-drain system. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we will be working on the storm drain until after April 15," Chan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the delays and cost overruns, a Pacific Palisades homeowners 
group asked the Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners on Friday to put 
off requests for additional funds and instead ask the City Council to pay for a 
new geological study of the canyon. The Pacific Palisades Residents Assn., 
which has long opposed filling the canyon, suggested that it would be cheaper 
for the city to purchase homes that are in jeopardy of sliding into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The association "fails to understand how the staff can recommend, or the board 
can possibly approve, additional funding for further construction when so many 
unresolved and unanticipated problems and costs are being encountered," Jack 
Allen, the group's president, wrote in a letter to board President William R. 
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander M. Man, an association member, urged the board at its meeting to stop 
"putting good money in after bad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Buying Property Forever' 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant General Manager Joel Breitbart told the board that "our current 
overruns have nothing to do with the geology at the site," and he said that 
without the project, the department would be forced to buy row after row of 
homes affected by new landslides. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't fill this canyon, we will be buying property up there forever," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by one commissioner about the cost overruns, Breitbart 
responded: "Yes, this project is going to cost more than we originally 
estimated. We don't believe it will be substantially more." 
</P>
<P>
Braude, who said he was skeptical about the fill idea when it was first 
proposed several years ago, said he now believes that it is necessary to 
"protect the public safety and the financial interests of the city." He 
described critics of the project as "well-intentioned," but he said they are 
"relatively few." 
</P>
<P>
"The public benefit will be substantial," Braude said. "This is a mechanism 
whereby people will be able to get from . . . Palisades Park through the canyon 
all the way to the ocean. There will be a (pedestrian) bridge over the Pacific 
Coast Highway. It will make the ocean much more accessible." 
</P>
<P>
According to Chan's report, work on the storm drain has been delayed by a 
variety of unexpected events, including a broken water main near the canyon rim 
that flooded about 400 feet of the construction area. In late August, a slope 
partially collapsed during excavation, and a small slide occurred again in 
early September. When construction resumed, according to the report, the 
Department of Building and Safety required that "a person . . . stand and watch 
the slope with binoculars the entire time work was proceeding."

PICO RIVERA JAZZ BAND MARKS 25 YEARS UNDER SAME DEMONSTRATIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Seckler paces in front of the saxophone section, a musical score in one 
hand and a pen in the other. The Pico Rivera Stage-Jazz Band is pounding out an 
arrangement of "In the Mood" and the driving sound slams against the rehearsal 
hall walls. 
</P>
<P>
Seckler directs the band with body language. Bobbing his head to the beat, he 
suddenly drops to the floor in a crouch in an attempt to get the saxophones to 
play softer. Then he is back on his feet, lips pursed, as he matches each 
trumpet blast with a punch of his closed fist. 
</P>
<P>
An exasperated look crosses his face, and the fist changes to a flattened palm 
that slices the air as he whistles for the band to stop. "I don't hear any 
dynamic!" Seckler shouted, a trace of his native New York in his voice. "I 
don't hear the second measure building." 
</P>
<P>
Seckler, director of the city-sponsored band, has spent countless Sunday 
afternoons rehearsing in the activity room at Rivera Park. This year marks the 
25th anniversary of the 18-piece group, which Seckler founded when Pico Rivera 
officials were looking for entertainment at city-sponsored events. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, the city was looking for more of a concert band," Seckler said, 
"but I said 'Why not a jazz band?' " 
</P>
<P>
Since 1964, the volunteer band has been a professional springboard for several 
of the more than 100 musicians who have played in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had guys go on to play with Woody Herman, Buddy Rich, big bands like 
that," said Seckler, who teaches saxophone, clarinet and flute in Whittier and 
who used to play sax for the Charlie Barnett Band. The Pico Rivera band is also 
an outlet for retired musicians like John Harris, who gave up playing saxophone 
professionally for a 9-to-5 job. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is in my blood," said Harris, a Pico Rivera resident who has played in 
the band about 12 years. "This is my creative outlet." 
</P>
<P>
The band's brassy sounds occasionally attract youngsters in the park who lean 
against the door frame to listen. The powerful sounds of five saxophones, four 
trumpets and three trombones reverberate through the cement-floored room where 
the musicians are perched on folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Seckler estimates that about 60% of the band's members are working musicians, 
and the rest have other jobs. About a third of the members live in Pico Rivera; 
most of the others live in the Southeast area. Seckler recruits band members 
from among his students and at local high schools and colleges. The musicians 
range in age from 17 to the mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for the superstars," Seckler said. "I'm looking for a kid who 
loves music, who wants the experience and who wants to learn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plays at City Fetes 
</P>
<P>
The band performs for city gatherings such as those held on the Fourth of July 
and Cinco de Mayo, and also competes in local jazz festivals. In exchange, the 
city pays Seckler $2,100 a year as director and provides rehearsal space at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, the band is scheduled to record several big band arrangements at 
Rio Hondo College for broadcast on Los Angeles jazz radio station KKGO-FM. The 
session will be taped for Channel 53, United Cable Television's community 
access channel in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Seckler proudly recalled the band's early years when it won 
six first-place trophies at the annual Hollywood Bowl Battle of the Bands. But 
when passage of Proposition 13 eliminated funding for the Battle of the Bands 
and other school music programs, Seckler noticed a drop in the number of young 
musicians interested in joining the Pico Rivera band. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get a few kids who come to the rehearsals and listen, but it's not 
like it used to be," Seckler said. "The whole idea is to have the kids hear us 
and say, 'Hey, maybe someday I can be part of that band.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yells at Players 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Seckler contentedly works with his current crop of musicians, 
leaving messages on their answering machines to remind them of performances and 
pushing them to "Work! Work!" at rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"I get ticked off and yell and scream at them, but when the rehearsal is over 
everything is fine," said Seckler, whose briefcase features a picture of a 
pointing Uncle Sam with the message "I Want You to Practice."

L.B. COUNCIL COOL TO URGINGS FOR POLICE REVIEW PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY COMMISSION TO MEET WEDNESDAY, MAKE RECOMMENDATION 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite renewed calls for creation of a citizen review board to deal with 
police brutality complaints, members of the City Council remain cool to the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
A nationally broadcast videotape of a purported brutality incident -- in which 
a white Long Beach police officer appears to ram a black man into a plate glass 
window -- revived demands this week for establishment of a public review board. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that allegations of police abuse of minorities continue to surface year 
after year in Long Beach, the Rev. Norman Copeland of Grant AME Church urged 
the council at its Tuesday meeting to form a review board. "I would hope that 
there would be some steps taken." 
</P>
<P>
While commending the council for asking the Los Angeles County district 
attorney to open an independent investigation of the Saturday night shoving 
incident, community activist Sid Solomon argued that one investigation alone 
will not solve years of local complaints about police conduct. Solomon, 
president of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, advised the council to put the 
matter of a citizen review board on the next city ballot in 1990, since 
establishment of such a panel would require a voter-approved change in the city 
charter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Groups Advocated Board 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, spokesmen for other groups also advocated a civilian board, an 
idea that has been previously discussed but never approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the time is ripe," said Frank Berry, president of the Long Beach 
Chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. "It's just 
that the City Council is not in the right frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
He said his group has evidence and has produced victims and witnesses of police 
abuses. But he said it took the videotape to drive the point home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think with this incident, more citizens who have not been victims of police 
abuse can now have an opportunity to see what happens," Berry said, adding that 
in his opinion, such abuse commonly occurs in Long Beach. Berry said the city 
has turned aside most of the complaints his group has forwarded in recent years 
on grounds that they lacked adequate substantiation. 
</P>
<P>
The Lambda Democratic Club, a political forum for the city's gay and lesbian 
community, also remains firmly committed to the review board idea. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rosen, chairman of the club's Police Relations Committee, said his 
organization has documented numerous incidents of police harassment of gays. A 
review board with investigatory powers would take pressure off the police 
chief, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But council members seem unconvinced by such arguments, judging from their 
remarks at the Tuesday meeting and in separate interviews. Even Clarence Smith, 
the councilman who made the motion to call in the district attorney, is not yet 
prepared to say that a civilian panel would eliminate brutality cases in the 
city. "I don't know what the answer will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw Force Used 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the council's only black member, was also not ready to say Long Beach 
has more of a problem with police-minority relations than other cities. Still, 
he said he had seen local police officers force "a lot of blacks on the ground 
or over the hood of a car," but not whites. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members say that as residents of the city, they are the 
appropriate public representatives to review complaints about police conduct. 
"We are the civilian review board," Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg said when the 
matter came up during public comments at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark argued that "I don't think a police review board is a 
panacea that is going to solve all the problems. . . . Very few cities have had 
police review boards because they simply don't work well." 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to create a civilian panel have surfaced before, only to be shot down 
by city officials and council members, who have maintained that such a board 
would imply distrust in the city manager and police chief and would 
second-guess the police department. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell again stated his opposition to a review board, saying, "We 
have been elected to oversee the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
While reluctant to move ahead with a civilian board, council members insisted 
that brutality was something they will not tolerate on the local police force. 
"There's no place in this department for officers using direct force," Clark 
said, adding that any officers who engaged in such conduct "need to be weeded 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, saying the council had to find a way of maintaining discipline in the 
Police Department, declared he will not drop the matter until something is 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley said in remarks to the press that he welcomed 
the investigation by the district attorney as well as an investigation by the 
FBI as to whether police had violated the civil rights of the man they arrested 
Saturday night. But he disagreed with statements that his department has not 
adequately dealt with brutality complaints. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedure Revised 
</P>
<P>
Police procedures have been revised to deal more swiftly and effectively with 
abuse allegations and an advisory group representing minority groups has been 
established, Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the 22 months since he has been with the force, 
disciplinary action has been more extensive than ever. Under his tenure, about 
20 officers have been dismissed for disciplinary reasons including drug use, 
gambling and statutory rape, Binkley said. Last year an officer was fired for 
brutality involving a Latino youth, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The widely telecast videotape of last weekend's incident was secretly made by 
an NBC television crew working with two activists intent on demonstrating abuse 
of minorities by Long Beach police. Don Jackson, a Hawthorne police officer on 
administrative leave, and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, 
set up the sting when they drove into Long Beach in an old car Saturday night 
with the television crew's van following discreetly. 
</P>
<P>
The two were pulled over by a police patrol unit. Moments later, Officer Mark 
Dickey, as seen on the tape, appears to shove Jackson face-first into a plate 
glass window and throw him onto the police car. City officials have requested 
unedited tapes from NBC, saying the televised version is an incomplete account 
of what happened between the officers and the two men they pulled over. NBC is 
fighting the request on the grounds that releasing unedited footage violates 
company policy. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the policemen said the officers followed proper procedure in 
handling Jackson, who was simply being pushed up against the side of a building 
when the window broke. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jan Hall, agreeing with colleagues that the council was the 
appropriate body to handle police matters, said she "can't believe a police 
review board would be any more concerned than any single member of the City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Davis, chairman of city's Public Safety Commission, has long opposed 
increasing the commission's power or creating a citizen review board. But 
Wednesday, Davis said he had changed his mind. He said his reversal came when 
he viewed the videotape of the Saturday night incident, disliked the officer's 
conduct and noted discrepancies in the subsequent police statement describing 
the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he intends to call a special meeting of the commission at 7 p.m. 
next Wednesday in the auditorium of the main city library, which is in the City 
Hall complex on Ocean Boulevard in downtown. The session will be open to the 
public. After that, Davis said the commission will offer a recommendation to 
the City Council.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
SUIT OVER SEWER PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The executive board of the Malibu Township Council voted unanimously Monday to 
sue Los Angeles County in an effort to block construction of a $43-million 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which must be filed by Feb. 11, will allege that by approving the 
sewer plan last week, the Board of Supervisors imposed an unconstitutional tax 
on property owners. The typical Malibu homeowner would pay $9,900. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will charge that the levy is "not fairly distributed" since about 70% 
of the system's cost will be paid by property owners outside of the Civic 
Center area, but only a small fraction of the sewer plant's capacity will be 
used by those owners, Township Council attorney John Murdock said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit will charge that the county did not make a legally 
required "good faith" effort to analyze and reply to assertions by 
community-hired experts, who testified that septic tanks have caused no health 
hazard and are only a minor cause of landslides that have plagued the Malibu 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on the (township) council is angry and upset," said Leon Cooper, 
vice president of the 1,000-member council. "We feel we have been done a gross 
injustice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests of about 400 residents, the Board of Supervisors approved 
the Malibu sewer last Thursday, saying it was needed to solve a health problem 
created by overflows from septic tanks and to protect itself from landslide 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed 22 years of bitter public debate, during which residents said 
a regional sewer would prompt unwanted growth while the county said a sewage 
facility was necessary to keep waste water out of creeks and the ocean.

<P>
Attorney Mark Lehman has been elected president of the West Hollywood Chamber 
of Commerce for 1989. He replaces Tony Melia, who did not seek reelection after 
serving three consecutive one-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, 36, a former member of the Planning Commission, served on a citizens 
advisory panel that helped draft the city's General Plan, adopted last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Melia, who is credited with helping revitalize the chamber during his tenure,

<P>
HEARING SLATED ON BUILDING REINFORCEMENT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Park City Council has scheduled a hearing Feb. 6 on a proposed 
ordinance that would eventually require unreinforced masonry buildings to be 
strengthened, vacated or demolished to reduce injuries and damage during an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires the city to identify all such buildings and notify the 
owners by Jan. 1, 1990. If the ordinance passes, owners would have to 
strengthen, vacate or demolish affected buildings within 270 days of being 
notified by the city, said Sam Miller, the city's director of building and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners would pay the cost of making their buildings safe.

AWARD-WINNING CIVIC CLEANUP PROGRAM TO END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years, the city's "Let's Get Paramount Neighborhoods Lookin' Good" 
program, which targeted specific residential areas for cleanup, is coming to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which used volunteers, residents and city staff members to fix up 
and repair areas at no cost to residents, ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program began, about 2,000 volunteers worked more than 8,000 hours 
cleaning 1,000 properties, painting almost 700 homes and removing 3,400 tons of 
debris, said Patrick West, deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Lookin' Good program was one of three municipal projects that helped the 
city win the All-American City Award from the National Civic League last year. 
Paramount was one of 10 cities to be honored by the league for solving major 
community problems or issues.

DEVELOPER'S PLEA: NOT GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Abby Sher has pleaded not guilty to opening a museum-and-restaurant 
complex without proper permits, and a trial has been scheduled for Feb. 15, the 
city attorney's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
The plea was entered Tuesday in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Sher faces 15 counts of criminal violation of municipal codes stemming from a 
variety of art preview shows and open houses she allowed to be held at her 
Edgemar complex on Main Street last year. 
</P>
<P>
The city contends that she did not have occupancy and fire permits and, in some 
cases, did not have a proper business license. 
</P>

The complex houses the private Santa Monica Museum of Art and space for a 
restaurant.

COUNCIL OVERTURNS COMMISSION VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
SALE OF LLOYD WRIGHT STUDIO OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With none of the debate that marked the last time they dealt with the issue, 
West Hollywood's City Council on Tuesday approved the sale of the landmark home 
and architecture studio of the late Lloyd Wright to a financial planning firm. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-1 vote, the council overturned a Planning Commission recommendation that 
would have prevented Eric Lloyd Wright, the son of Lloyd Wright and grandson of 
Frank Lloyd Wright, from selling the property to financial planners Gail Gordon 
Kamer and Peggi Hager. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Land cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
The council's approval was needed as part of restrictions placed on use of the 
property last year. At that time, the council granted the owner's request to 
extend a conditional-use permit to allow part of the building to be used for 
commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission recommended against the proposed sale in December after 
concluding that the building's use by a financial planning firm would not be 
appropriate for the property. 
</P>
<P>
While owned by Eric Lloyd Wright since his father's death in 1978, the building 
at 858 N. Doheny Drive has long been considered something of a public trust by 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architect's Home, Studio 
</P>
<P>
From the time he built the textile block structure in 1928 to the time of his 
death, Lloyd Wright -- whose work includes the original Hollywood Bowl Shell -- 
lived upstairs and used the downstairs as a studio, which accounts for the 
building's being best known as the Lloyd Wright Studio. It was placed on the 
National Register of Historic Places in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the last seven years, a small real estate firm specializing in historic and 
architectural properties has occupied the old studio, with a partner in the 
firm living upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Hager said she and her partner plan to purchase the property within three 
months. She declined to disclose the sales price, saying it is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is in need of considerable restoration. We want to restore it and 
treat it as the landmark that it is," she said. The downstairs will be used as 
an office, and Hager will occupy the upstairs as living quarters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, with Land casting a dissenting vote, the council sided with the 
owner and against angry neighbors in allowing the downstairs to continue to be 
used for commercial purposes, despite its not conforming with residential 
zoning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architectural Integrity 
</P>
<P>
In granting a 99-year extension to the nonconforming use of the downstairs, the 
council accepted Eric Lloyd Wright's argument that without the extension, only 
buyers interested in converting the building entirely to residential use would 
be interested in purchasing the property, something he said would destroy its 
architectural integrity. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen residents, angered by what they described as a commercial intrusion 
into their neighborhood, opposed the extension, citing increased traffic 
congestion and parking problems near the building. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, only one resident spoke against the council's approval of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Dobrin expressed concern that the city would not be able to enforce 
several additional conditions it attached to the prospective new owners' use of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its decision last year, the council required Wright to obtain a 
historic facade easement on the property prior to ever selling it to ensure its 
future preservation. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council also added a restriction that any restoration to the 
interior courtyard area, which officials said might not fall under the previous 
easement, be done in compliance with certain federal standards.

Alcohol- and other drug-related crashes are the leading cause of death for 
young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Graduation is just around the 
corner, and this time of celebration can quickly turn to tragedy. In fact, 13 
young people died in such crashes in Ventura County last year. 
</P>
<P>
Local initiatives such as Operation Graduation are making a difference in 
eliminating this tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
We can use your help to make prom/graduation 1989 a great success.

Attending a basketball game between the "Court Jesters" -- the Ventura County 
district attorney's office -- and the "Donut Dunkers" -- the California Highway 
Patrol -- at the Buena High School gym at 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 21, is one way 
you can help and have some family fun at the same time. All proceeds will be

$31-MILLION RENOVATION PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
STORM-RAVAGED KING HARBOR BEGINS RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after the start of a series of storm and fire disasters, King Harbor in 
Redondo Beach is on the way to recovery, city officials and harbor business 
people say. 
</P>
<P>
More than $31 million in private and public improvement projects are either 
completed, in progress or being planned in the effort to restore the harbor as 
a major recreational area before the city's centennial observance in 1992, 
Harbor Director Sheila Schoettger said. 
</P>
<P>
"When all the scars are gone, King Harbor will be even more beautiful," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger acknowledged, however, that the city has some major financial 
hurdles to overcome. The biggest is raising the $6 million needed to 
reconstruct the 60-year-old Horseshoe Pier, most of which was destroyed by fire 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Guarantees' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we can do it all," she said, "But there are no guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted in September, after a community debate, to restore the 
pier. Some contended that the pier attracted gangs and caused traffic 
congestion, while others maintained that it was an essential feature of the 
beach community. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two of the original 48 shops and restaurants are still in business on 
the south portion of Horseshoe Pier and the adjacent Monstad Pier. Merchants 
say the number of visitors has dropped 30% to 45%, partly because many people 
think the pier area was totally wiped out by the fire and three major storms 
last year. It is estimated that about 8 million people visited the harbor and 
4.5 million visited the pier in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people living within six or eight blocks who have not checked yet to 
see whether anybody's left here," said Chuck Milner, owner of the Pier Import 
Shop on the south leg of Horseshoe Pier, which angles off from the base of 
Monstad Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Milner and his wife, Judy, lost a cluster of four other shops in the Edge 
Restaurant building when the north and ocean sides of the pier were damaged in 
the January and April storms and then finished off by the fire and more high 
waves in late May. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said he and most other merchants plan to restore their businesses after 
the city reconstructs the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Another pier business owner, Tony Trutanich, said his two restaurants -- one on 
Monstad Pier and the other on the south end of Horseshoe Pier -- incurred only 
minor damage and his business remains fairly stable. 
</P>
<P>
But less fortunate shop owners have lost more than half of their customers as a 
result of the 1988 disasters, he said, partly because there are fewer places to 
attract visitors to the pier area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restaurants to Reopen 
</P>
<P>
The January storm, believed to be a once-in-every-75-years phenomenon, also 
demolished the Blue Moon Saloon and heavily damaged Reuben's Restaurant and the 
Portofino Inn, all on the harbor shore north of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration of those restaurants is in the planning or construction stages. 
Reuben's and the Portofino Inn are planning to reopen in June. 
</P>
<P>
To secure King Harbor against future onslaughts from the sea, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers plans to raise the south portion of the harbor's northern 
breakwater about five feet to the 20-foot-plus level of the rest of the 
barrier. The shorter southern breakwater will be doubled in length to 600 feet 
to head off waves at the harbor entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.9-million breakwater project, now in the design and testing phase, is 
expected to be completed in early 1991, with the city paying 35% of the cost 
and the federal government financing for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger said the city has applied for a loan from the state Department of 
Boating and Waterways to cover its share of the breakwater project, which was 
planned before the January storms. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the new pier, however, "is much less clear," Schoettger said. 
"We're hoping the state will provide about $2.5 million and we're still looking 
for the rest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30,000 Contributed 
</P>
<P>
Possible avenues, she said, include a bond issue, a bank loan and contributions 
from businesses and individuals. She said those contributions have reached 
$30,000 without a major fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
A design committee is scheduled to select a firm by early February to draft 
initial proposals. If all goes well, construction on the pier, possibly using 
steel or concrete pilings instead of wood, could start late this year or in 
early 1990, Schoettger said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have the whole package put together, including designs and the 
financing we'll need, I think the project will become much more real to 
people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger said there is broad community support for rebuilding the pier, but 
residents differ on how large it should be and how much of it should be devoted 
to businesses. The city will ask the design firm for three options: 
</P>
<P>
One would provide less than the 21,500 square feet of commercial space lost in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The second would provide the same amount of commercial space available at the 
old pier. 
</P>
<P>
The third would have the same amount of business space, plus about 6,000 square 
feet for some type of public building. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas for the building so far include an art gallery, theater, meeting or 
multipurpose room, marine study quarters and a museum, Schoettger said. 
</P>
<P>
To make reconstruction of the pier a community project, the city invited 
residents to submit design ideas. More than 200 were received and they will be 
reviewed by the city's designer, Schoettger said. 
</P>
<P>
The 132-room Portofino Inn, which was heavily damaged when 20-foot waves surged 
into the harbor in January, plans to reopen this summer after completion of an 
$8-million reconstruction and expansion project, said Peter Snowden, a general 
partner in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
31-Suite Addition 
</P>
<P>
He said renovation of the existing rooms, a new waterfront lobby and a 31-suite 
addition "will transform what was a motor hotel into a first-class resort 
hotel." The renovated hotel will reopen June 1 and the new suites will be ready 
in August, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Conway, Reuben's project manager, said the firm expects to receive its 
final building permits and then immediately start reconstruction of the 
restaurant to meet a reopening date of June 1. Demolition of the damaged 
portion of the building and construction of new foundations began shortly after 
the storm last January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben's also owned the Breakers restaurant that was destroyed in the pier fire 
in May. Conway said a decision on rebuilding it will be made after the new pier 
is constructed and "we have a chance to see whether the customer base is still 
there."

In November, representatives from the county chapters of the National 
Organization for Women met with the Ventura County family law mediation 
department. The meeting was amiable and we are following up with some 
recommendations. We are also looking forward to future meetings. 
</P>

are the result of living in a society that discriminates against women. 
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Council Advisory Committee on Gender Bias in the Courts is 
collecting data and facts on this. We encourage you, especially if you feel you 
have been treated unfairly in the court system, to give input to this 
committee. A public hearing will be held Jan. 30 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the 
Mark Taper Hall of Economics, California Museum of Science and Industry, 700 
State Drive, Los Angeles. 
</P>

TALENT SHOWS PUT END TO VANDALISM AT ROSEMEAD SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODIAN HELPS STUDENTS BECOME STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Custodian Hector Pena had it up to here with problem kids who vandalized the 
bathrooms at Fern Elementary School every day. 
</P>
<P>
His solution -- to have the troublemakers star in their own show -- was new to 
teachers and administrators, who thought that they had tried everything. And it 
certainly was an innovative approach to custodial work. 
</P>
<P>
Now, three years and several student talent shows later, Pena has become a 
highly appreciated producer of dazzling entertainment at the school in 
Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
The girls in that first show -- whose ringleader proved to be "a great little 
rocker with real talent," Pena said -- graduated and did well in intermediate 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism ended then, but Pena has continued to produce about three shows a 
year. Performers have included low achievers who need some kind of success, as 
well as good students who just want to perform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidante, Leader 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 38, has taken on the unpaid roles of confidante, problem-solver, music 
teacher, youth leader, service club director and PTA officer. 
</P>
<P>
Outside school, Pena is a part-time professional percussionist who plays with a 
variety of groups and for studio shows. He also knows how to use sound and 
light equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Hector's job title might not be teacher, but he does teach all the time," said 
Randy Knight, a special education teacher at Fern Intermediate School, which 
adjoins the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Knight remembers the ringleader of the first group Pena worked with as a 
special education student in his class, when he taught the sixth grade. "She 
didn't have any friends and was kind of looked down on," he recalled. But after 
that first show, Knight said, "boy, all of a sudden, she was popular and 
everyone wanted to sit next to her. She got her little limelight." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said: "That's all she needed, just a little. And she took off from there." 
</P>
<P>
The girls had been "taking their anger out on the school," he said. "I guess 
they had knocked on every door and I was the last door." 
</P>
<P>
Pena had already been assisting with entertainment at the school, and several 
girls who had caused the mischief told him of their interest in performing. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted their own music, and I said, 'OK, come in here during recess and 
let's see.' They did and I said, 'Wow! I know we got something here!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show a Success 
</P>
<P>
The show, presented on the last day of school that June, was such a success 
that students were dancing in the aisles and teachers asked for a second 
performance, said Knight and Jim Dugdale, a sixth-grade teacher who also 
teaches music and works with Pena and Knight on the shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have kept those girls. I would have thrown them out," Dugdale said. 
"But Hector has so much more patience than anyone else. He pulled them 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since that first show, students have made up their own acts and auditioned 
for Pena's approval in little groups, singing and dancing along with popular 
records and tapes. They rehearse during recess and lunch period for up to three 
months. The shows are presented at student assemblies. Pena, Knight and Dugdale 
provide special sound effects, scenery and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Pena said his volunteer work stems from a lifelong interest in youngsters, and 
his knowledge of music helps him to help them. 
</P>
<P>
He understands a child's mental processes enough to know that bathroom 
vandalism and other antisocial behavior are sometimes directly related to 
personal problems, including academic failure. Children who act in a 
destructive manner often have no one to talk to and need attention and 
encouragement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just care a lot about these kids," he said. "They're here every day. 
Somebody's gotta pay attention to them. Somebody's gotta communicate with them, 
help them to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like that big heart is right there and you ask -- how close can you get 
to that? That's what I ask myself every day." 
</P>
<P>
Pena began working for the Garvey School District at Fern School in 1981. While 
continuing his regular workload, he volunteered to help Dugdale, who is blind, 
with student Christmas shows. 
</P>
<P>
When the first group of students asked Pena to help them perform in 1986, he 
said, he got Principal Joyce Metevia's permission to coach them during recess 
in the school cafeteria, which has a stage and doubles as an assembly hall. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is often simultaneously pushing a dust mop and calling out advice from the 
back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Communicate with your hands," he'll call out. Or, "Use the whole stage, not 
just a little spot," or "Looks good! Looks good!" 
</P>
<P>
Students say the performances give them confidence that helps them in the 
classroom. While some have academic problems, Pena said others are good 
students who just want to sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Better' 
</P>
<P>
"I just started in December and already I feel better," said Jaime Sellers, a 
sixth-grader. "I was kind of embarrassed auditioning in front of three people, 
and now it's OK in front of 10." 
</P>
<P>
Jaime is in a group rehearsing to perform Tiffany's hit song, "I Think We're 
Alone Now." 
</P>
<P>
She may grow up to sing and dance, she said, "because everybody is so nice and 
smiling and clapping after, and telling you that's great. And Hector's always 
telling you nice things about it. I don't even think he's a grown-up, he's so 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Angel, 10, a fifth-grader, said Pena helped him with a special "rap" on 
drugs that he performed last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's different from other adults -- he helps us out with difficulties," said 
Oscar Rodriguez, 11, another sixth-grader whose group pantomimes a tape by New 
Kids on the Block, "Please Don't Go, Girl." 
</P>
<P>
"I think in many instances Hector has helped children with achievements outside 
of the classroom," Metevia said. "The shows are good, and it's rather 
prestigious for children to be in them. I think it is rather rare that a 
custodian would put so much extra time like this." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he grew up in a large family in a housing project in East Los 
Angeles, where one particular friend stands out as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
"His name was Alfred, and he taught the kids how to dance and to play a little 
football. He was much older, but he liked us and we liked hanging around him. 
He would get teams together and help us express ourselves. It helped a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more or less how I'm carrying myself, through his example." 
</P>
<P>
To be an example, Pena said he "would not dare" to smoke or even talk about 
drinking anything alcoholic, nor will he allow the children to use dirty 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is married and has two stepchildren, ages 20 and 13. He lives near Fern 
School, and Knight and Dugdale said he often drops by on weekends to check on 
the school. He has also organized a club, Service Cubs, made up of Fern 
students who qualify for membership with good grades and volunteer service. 
They help at the school with such chores as setting up equipment before shows, 
gardening and assisting kindergarten children in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is also historian for the Fern School PTA, which pays for the Service 
Cubs' jackets and for special outings. Pena said he rewards the Service Cubs 
and volunteer students with these special treats "because kids should always be 
rewarded." 
</P>
<P>
In a school with 550 pupils, Pena said, "all of them have something unique to 
give or to express. I like to express myself as a friend, someone they can 
trust. If they get hurt or lost or whatever, they can come to me and maybe I 
can help them solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm here. Thank God for schools."

SETTING SAIL ANEW;

<P>
VENTURA YACHT CLUB EMBARKS ON ANOTHER SEASON OF RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Roberts peers at a cluster of racing yachts jockeying into position for 
the start of the Ventura Yacht Club's first regatta of the season. He checks 
his wristwatch, looks to see that no yachts have lurched prematurely across the 
starting line and tenses in anticipation of the shotgun blast that starts each 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Once the first wave of streamlined spinnaker racing yachts slip across the 
starting line, Roberts readies himself to repeat the procedure for the next 
race 5 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the crew on the club's racing committee yacht, Roberts oversees the 
start of the races and watches for rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
With the race underway and the yachts off on their 8-mile trek across the Santa 
Barbara Channel, Dick Massa of Ventura, another member of the racing committee, 
settles back to reminisce about some of the less orderly races he's seen in his 
12 years with the club. 
</P>
<P>
"You better believe it gets competitive out there," Massa said. "Sometimes, 
it's worse than the America's Cup. These guys will fight to settle something." 
</P>
<P>
While Massa has never been called upon to settle any fisticuffs, he has 
refereed some strong verbal disagreements between competitors following a race. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Stanton, commodore of the Ventura Yacht Club, agrees that the competitors 
take their racing seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of Corinthian spirit among the members, but it gets 
competitive," Stanton said. "Nobody goes out there to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Races are only part of the allure of this yacht club, which draws members from 
as far as Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The strong prevailing winds that sweep across the Santa Barbara Channel from 
Point Conception, north of Santa Barbara, to Point Dume is the biggest 
attraction of the Ventura Yacht Club, which has used the channel for sloop and 
yacht races for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph and Bonnie Koerner of Phoenix fly their private plane twice a month to 
Ventura to take advantage of the channel's prime sailing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I don't have an ocean in Arizona, I like to borrow the one in Ventura on 
the weekends," Ralph Koerner said. "This Santa Barbara Channel has some of the 
best sailing of anywhere on the West Coast."

<P>
After sailing for 20 years with the Marina del Rey Yacht Club, Roberts, of 
Canoga Park switched to the Ventura club to escape the congested sailing lanes 
around Marina del Rey and Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for the smallest, most convenient club I could find and I think 
I've found a gem here," Roberts said. "Everybody knows everybody, there are not 
that many boats in the Ventura Harbor and when you sail to these nearby islands 
you really feel like you have gotten away from it all." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran sailors like Howard Young, 80, of Ventura can recall when club members 
moored their boats in Santa Barbara -- until the Ventura Harbor was built in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
In more than 30 years of sailing, often with his wife, Virginia, 75, as his 
only crew, Young has been content not to venture beyond the 100-mile boundaries 
of the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"The farther south you go from here, the calmer the winds get," Young said. 
"The conditions here would be ideal for the America's Cup." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the Ventura Cup will have to do. Eight area yacht clubs are 
expected to compete in this year's Ventura Cup, slated for Sept. 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Ventura Yacht Club's members gear up all season for the Ventura 
Cup. Others, however, prefer the noncompetitive aspect of sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the pride you get from yachting is just using the wind and water and 
figuring out what to do out there," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a devotee of noncompetitive yachting, would rather cruise his 29-foot 
sloop on pleasure trips than compete for trophies in the club's monthly races. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, sailing is a release from other things, so I'm not real anxious to get 
into the stressfulness of racing," Roberts said. "For the cruising sailor, like 
myself, it's the infinite variety of weather that's challenging. There is 
nobody out there to tell you when to take the sail up or down. It's all up to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
There are some members, however, such as club secretary Ann Keller of Ventura, 
who don't like racing or slow sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"If it isn't at least 700 feet long, I don't get on it," Keller said. "I get 
nauseous just standing on a yacht."

DECISION ON SANTA CLARA DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Section Executive Committee will wait until Santa Clara basketball 
Coach Lou Cvijanovich explains his actions in person before determining whether 
the Saints or Cvijanovich will be penalized for withdrawing from the South 
Coast Holiday Christmas Tournament at Estancia High in December. 
</P>
<P>
A closed hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 30 at the Southern Section office 
in Cerritos. Cvijanovich and Santa Clara principal Sister Adrienne Pereira will 
appear before the 5 officers of the executive committee. Tournament directors 
Chuck and Art Perry, who filed the complaint, are also expected to be present. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara forfeited 2 consolation games and apparently violated a written 
contract for not fulfilling its obligation to play 4 games in the 16-team 
tournament. Cvijanovich decided to pull his team from the tournament after 
complaining about the officiating during a 39-38 second-round loss to 
Huntington Beach Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Citing one-sided officiating for his actions, Cvijanovich has said in published 
reports that he was concerned about the welfare of his players and feared that 
someone would get hurt if his team continued to play. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich refused further comment until a decision has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament directors claim they have suffered a financial loss because gate 
receipts had to be refunded and referees had to be paid. Opposing schools are 
upset because they were unable to play a scheduled game. 
</P>
<P>
The executive committee, a 12-member panel consisting of school principals and 
athletic directors, was expected to make a decision about the issue during a 
weekend meeting in Palm Desert, but was unable to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complicated issue that has no precedent," Southern Section 
administrator Dean Crowley said. "The council is concerned about protecting the 
interest of the tournament and give due process to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"Things can be said in writing, but the council has questions that need to be 
answered. And neither the school nor the tournament officials were present." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Tom Jacobson of Corona del Mar, superintendent Gary Smidderks of L. 
A. Baptist, superintendent Bruce Keuning of Bellflower Christian Schools, 
superintendent Robert Packer of Duarte Unified School District and Southern 
Section Commissioner Stan Thomas will listen to testimony and make a 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member committee is expected to make a final decision after its next 
meeting Feb. 16, which is prior to the conclusion of the basketball playoffs.

TEN WALK OUT AT SAN JOSE ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten San Jose State basketball players, accusing Coach Bill Berry of "mental 
cruelty," have refused to play or practice again as long as Berry is the coach. 
</P>
<P>
But Athletic Director Randy Hoffman backed Berry Wednesday and said that 
although only 4 players remain, San Jose State will field a team in its 
scheduled game against Cal State Fullerton tonight at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Berry is our men's basketball coach. He has my confidence and is the head 
coach," Hoffman said in a news conference Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The group of players, including 4 starters, refused to practice Tuesday. The 
players met with Hoffman Wednesday morning, then called their own news 
conference in the afternoon, an hour after the team was to depart for 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we have been through enough mental cruelty and enough threats," 
senior guard Anthony Perry said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The players declined to elaborate or provide examples, but Perry said "3 or 4" 
players had sought psychiatric care as a result of Berry's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been here, he's snatched up a few players, not physically abused, 
but snatched them by their jerseys," Perry said. "It's just things that go on 
behind closed doors in practice. People see Berry as a jolly person and a great 
guy, but no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. . . . We felt it was 
time it came to an end. Until something is done, we refuse to play. . . . All 
we know is we think they should make a change." 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he was "hurt" by the players' action. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he swears at the players and admitted that he had been asked by 
Hoffman to "mellow" this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I have done that," Berry said. "I do swear some, but I teach, and I 
teach effectively and well . . . I don't feel I was asking them to do anything 
I wouldn't do myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously disappointed in the decision by some of these players and the 
emotional reaction of these young men," Berry said. "But we plan to field a 
team and do it with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
The team -- minus the 10 boycotting players among whom are starters Perry, 
Steve Haney, Dietrich Waters and Rodney Scott -- is scheduled to travel to 
Fullerton today. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 remaining players have a combined average of 13 points a game, led by Jan 
Svoboda, a 6-foot 9-inch senior center who has started 12 of 16 games and is 
averaging 6 points and 4 rebounds a game. Dwain Daniels, a 6-4 junior guard, 
has started 3 games, and Tom Desiano, a 6-1 junior guard, has started 1. Kevin 
Logan, a 6-6 freshman forward, had been scheduled to be a red-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic department officials Wednesday evening were seeking students to fill 
out the squad, focusing on athletes in other sports whose eligibility already 
is certified. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he would consider allowing the players to return if they change 
their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"I would handle each case individually," he said. "If a player came to me and 
said he made a mistake, I would be willing to look him in the eye and say, 
'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
The player walkout was thought Tuesday to be connected with the Spartans' 
struggles this season. They are 5-11 and have lost 5 consecutive games. San 
Jose State absorbed its worst loss of the season last month when it was routed 
by Stanford, 89-39. 
</P>
<P>
But the players said Wednesday that the losses were not a factor in the 
walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, in his 10th season at the school, has a record of 142-132. The Spartans 
were 14-15 last season and were led by Berry's son Ricky, who averaged 24 
points a game, leading the conference in scoring.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Cincinnati football players Anthony Munoz and Max Montoya, the USC-UCLA 
game played in Pasadena last Nov. 19 was of vital importance. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, the one-time Trojan lineman, and Montoya, formerly a Bruin lineman, were 
going out to dinner together that night but couldn't choose their wardrobes 
until the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
"They bet on it every year," Montoya's wife, Patti, said the other day. "The 
loser has to wear the other guy's letterman jacket all evening." 
</P>
<P>
So, that night, after Munoz had cheered USC in, Montoya was a Trojan for a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been worse," he said here the other day. "What if I'd had to go 
to SC!" 
</P>
<P>
Shuddering, he murmured: "How awful." 
</P>
<P>
After the USC-UCLA games of recent years, Montoya has never had trouble 
climbing into Munoz's clothes. Standing 6 feet 5 or 6 inches and weighing 
upward of 275 pounds, these are people who resemble super-heavyweight 
wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
Here for their second Super Bowl in 8 years, they have been teammates since 
1980 in the Bengal line, the bulkiest and, some say, the best offensive line in 
the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz is the Bengals' left tackle, Montoya their right guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I still find that absolutely amazing," Montoya said. "Two Mexicans from Los 
Angeles, one from SC, one from UCLA, winding up on the same NFL team -- in 
Cincinnati, of all places -- and playing pro football together all these 
years." 
</P>
<P>
They've already doubled the longevity of the average NFL player, 3 1/2 years, 
and the end is nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, 30, a first-round draft choice in 1980, said that he and Montoya, 31, a 
seventh-round choice in 1979, are almost the league's only Mexican-American 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"The world has never had a whole lot of Mexican nose tackles," he said. 
"There's a few kickers, that's all. There's Lupe Sanchez at Pittsburgh, and a 
few with Mexican names, Ruben Rodriguez at Seattle, the Zendejas brothers." 
</P>
<P>
None of the others, though, is ever mistaken for a super-heavyweight wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how Maxie and I got so big," Munoz said. "But as a guess, I'd say 
that Mexican food had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Both men relish their college connections. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have been caught dead at UCLA," said Munoz, who played for USC in 
the late '70s, when Montoya was at UCLA. "But I've found over the years that 
anyone you get to know, you like -- even a Bruin." 
</P>
<P>
Of his early years in Cincinnati, Montoya said: "At first, it was hard for me 
to get used to playing in the same offensive line with a Trojan. To make it 
worse, they made us room together. That's when I found out that Moon isn't a 
bad sort at all -- for a Trojan." 
</P>
<P>
Moon and Maxie. 
</P>
<P>
"Enemies once, allies now," Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on the NFL level, college affiliations tend to blur everywhere -- 
regardless of whether an Oklahoma Sooner, say, is on the same club with a 
Nebraska Cornhusker or an opposing club. 
</P>
<P>
Among pros, the rivalries that last are conference rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
Trojans and Bruins typically close ranks to think of themselves as Pac-10 guys 
who wouldn't give the time of day to Big Eight guys, not to mention the oafs 
from the deep South. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play pro ball against all kinds of guys, you see how much better the 
football is up and down the Pacific Coast than it is anywhere in the Big Ten," 
Munoz said, smiling as if he might or might not believe that. 
</P>
<P>
The key now, plainly, is to bait the Big Ten instead of the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz continued: "Up here, you find that Maxie's a whole lot better guy than 
any Buckeye." 
</P>
<P>
MEAN AND NASTY? 
</P>
<P>
Munoz and Montoya rank with the finest blockers in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, in fact, after a long career as a Pro Bowl player, is usually identified 
as the NFL's top offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's probably the best that's played in an offensive line in the 
'80s," CBS analyst John Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he reacts to such praise, Munoz said: "First, I like to hear it. Who 
wouldn't? Second, it drives me to keep improving." 
</P>
<P>
He is of the opinion that his pre-NFL life as a basketball player and baseball 
player -- he pitched and played the infield for USC -- made him what he is in 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the biggest third baseman in captivity," he said. "That made me work 
very hard on my agility, to keep up with the little guys. 
</P>
<P>
"In basketball, I was staggering around at 260 pounds trying to guard 
180-pounders. That made me work hard on my quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"You aren't exactly born quick, you know. The things you need the most as an 
offensive linemen are quickness and agility, and you have to develop them 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"I really doubt if I'd be the football player I am if I hadn't liked basketball 
and baseball so much that I pushed myself to excel." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, on the other hand, is often called football's model offensive guard. 
He is a master pass blocker in a league that treasures the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of his career, Montoya has graded with or above the best (NFL) guards 
in pass blocking," said Joel Buchsbaum, Pro Football Weekly's personnel expert. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has played in the Pro Bowl and won some all-pro distinction, 
Montoya would be more famous in the NFL, no doubt, if he weren't on the same 
team with a player as celebrated as Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
Those who choose honor teams often reason that one blocker or, say, one 
cornerback, per club, is enough. That's unfair -- but they aren't going to 
leave Munoz off, which, most of the time, leaves Montoya out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't seem to bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how good I am," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Cincinnati offensive line coach Jim McNally: "We know how good he is. 
Max is nothing but a mean, nasty man." 
</P>
<P>
Of Munoz, McNally, who has coached his two Los Angeles players throughout their 
pro careers, said: "Anthony doesn't blow people off the line like he did when 
he was younger. But he's still mean. He's the best athlete playing this game." 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Munoz is a living reminder of the talent that USC has had over 
the years in its offensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
One day at USC, when Munoz went down with one of the three knee injuries that 
all but wrecked his college career, he was replaced by a freshman named Don 
Mosebar, who in time was to become the best player in the Raiders' offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
In a Trojan game a few weeks later when Mosebar also went down, he was replaced 
by Bruce Matthews, who was to become the best player in the Houston Oilers' 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Said Montoya: "It's tough sledding in L.A. for the gutty little Bruins. 
Everybody knows that." 
</P>
<P>
OR TEDDY BEARS? 
</P>
<P>
The place to go for a night out in Ft. Mitchell, Ky., which is across the river 
from Cincinnati, is a Mexican restaurant called Montoya's. 
</P>
<P>
"Best Mexican food in the state," Montoya said. "With one exception." 
</P>
<P>
Where's that? 
</P>
<P>
"In Covington, Ky.," he said. "There's a great Mexican restaurant there, too." 
</P>
<P>
That one is also known as Montoya's, Montoya said. He plans to spend the rest 
of his life in the restaurant business, operating these and, he hopes, other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"We might need a few more," his wife, Patti, said. "With only two, Maxie eats 
up most of the profits." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, unlike Montoya, isn't aiming for a business career, although he is a 
licensed realtor. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, I expect that Anthony will be in broadcasting, or maybe he'll just 
stay in the community work that he loves so much," said Munoz's wife, Dede, an 
amateur painter and singer who was born in Germany when her soldier father was 
stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the NFL is more widely involved in community projects than Dede's 
husband, who is active in Athletes in Action, United Appeal, Cystic Fibrosis, 
the Salvation Army, and 12 or 14 other charitable organization. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Munoz spent Christmas Day waiting on tables at a Salvation Army 
dinner after persuading some of his teammates and coaches, including Sam Wyche, 
to join him there. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam looks a little different in an apron," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On his vacations, Munoz likes to make missionary trips to Mexico, where, the 
last time, he worked as a dental technician. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Munozes) are the only (Bengal) family in the Faith Evangelical Free 
Church of Milford, Ohio," Munoz said. "I went to Mexico with a dentist from our 
church. We traveled around where some people hadn't seen a dentist in 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that made the most impression on me is how warm they are -- and how 
they wanted to give (the dentist) something when they couldn't pay him 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz has heard, he said, that one of his forebears in Mexico stood 7 feet 
tall. All he knows for sure is that he was born in San Bernardino and grew up 
in a fatherless family in Ontario with 2 older brothers and 2 younger sisters. 
</P>
<P>
He said he met Dede one day when, as opponents, they were playing softball, a 
pastime they still favor, men's, women's, or co-ed, any old way. They have a 
boy, Michael, 7, and a girl, Michelle, 6. They live in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Max and Patti Lynn Montoya, who were introduced by mutual friends at UCLA, live 
in Villa Hills, Ky., 2 miles from one of their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"Close enough to take out, I'm very happy to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They also have a boy and girl, Matthew and Alison, 6-year-old twins. 
</P>
<P>
Maxie Montoya, son of a truck driver who is still on the road, was born in 
Montebello and grew up in La Puente with a sister who is now a postal worker 
and a brother who is a carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, persons of Mexican descent have strong family ties and neither 
Munoz nor Montoya is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Moon and Maxie, in fact, each have two close families -- their own and the 
Bengal offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"On any football team, the offensive line is always a little team in itself," 
Patti Montoya said. "And you can imagine what the Bengal line is like with two 
warm-hearted (Mexican-Americans) in there. 
</P>
<P>
"Maxie and Anthony and the other fellows in the (Bengal) offensive line are 
just a bunch of big Teddy bears. I've never known anyone as gentle as Maxie." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Patti, his coach says he's nasty and mean. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Maxie is kind and gentle," she said. "The things he loves the most 
are his family, the (Bengal) offensive line, and Mexican food, not necessarily 
in that order."

YANKEES NEED WINFIELD, WITH WASHINGTON GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE MARCUS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Steinbrenner may have to reconsider his position on ridding himself of 
Dave Winfield after Tuesday's announcement that free-agent outfielder Claudell 
Washington had bolted from the New York Yankees to accept a 3-year contract 
with the Angels for $2.625 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees were having difficult negotiations with Washington, but he had 
expected to re-sign with them until about two weeks ago, when the Angels came 
in with their offer. "Believe me, I didn't want to go," Washington said from 
his home in Orinda, Calif. "The Yankees more or less forced me out of town. If 
I had my choice I would have remained a Yankee." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bob Quinn said the Yankees were unwilling to match the length 
of the Angels' contract. "We didn't feel it was appropriate to give a 
34-year-old outfielder a three-year contract," Quinn said. "He had a career 
year (in 1988). Historically he has played extremely well in (the final year of 
his contract) and not as well after that. The third year (in the Angels' offer) 
surprised us. We were talking about two years and an option." The Yankees are 
believed to have offered about $1.8 million over the two years. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hit .308 last season, with 11 home runs and 64 RBI in 455 at-bats. 
He played in 126 games and stole 15 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the Yankees had no plans to go outside the organization for another 
center fielder. Roberto Kelly is likely to get a shot at playing every day. 
Kelly, a right-handed hitter, was supposed to have platooned in center field 
with Washington last season, but a sprained left wrist limited him to 38 games. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Jefferson, acquired from the San Diego Padres in the Jack Clark trade, 
will get a look, but he brings a reputation as a light hitter. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible new Manager Dallas Green will try to persuade Rickey 
Henderson to move from left field to center. Under Lou Piniella, Henderson 
balked at playing center. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, with Washington and Clark gone, the Yankees may not be able to 
afford losing Winfield's bat. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's agent, Tom Reich, is a good friend of Steinbrenner's, and both 
worked on moving Clark to the Padres. But Quinn had warned that Steinbrenner's 
relationship with Reich probably would not help in these negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Washington expected the Yankees to duplicate the Angels' offer. "You would 
think so," he said. "But they didn't and I had to do what was best for me and 
my family." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 34, will receive $2.625 million during the life of the contract. He 
will get a $300,000 signing bonus, $875,000 this year, $575,000 in 1990 and 
$875,000 in 1991. He can earn an additional $50,000 per year in performance 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said that even with the Angels' offer in hand, he had to think twice 
about leaving the Yankees, who had acquired him from the Atlanta Braves for Ken 
Griffey in 1986. Washington became one of the more popular players among his 
Yankees teammates. "It was real tough; I'm going to miss every one of them," he 
said. "I wish them all the best. I hope they wish the same for me. We had far 
more good times than bad times." 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed-hitting Washington has a lifetime batting average of .280, with 
150 home runs, 773 runs batted in and 295 stolen bases.

THE KEY TO PERRY'S FUTURE WAS LOCKING UP THE PAST

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Locked away in a file cabinet somewhere are 2 years of Chana Perry's life, 
penned by her own hand, splashed with her own tears. 
</P>
<P>
Forty or 50 pages long, by her recollection, it is a diary that tells the story 
of one of the most sordid recruiting scandals in the history of women's college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The assignment was intended, in part, as therapy, a way to help reconcile the 
conflicts that twisted her final years as a teen-ager. It took Perry nearly 3 
months to complete, yet she has not seen it since the day 2 1/2 years ago that 
she turned it over to Earnest Riggins, the San Diego State coach, who said he 
read it, had it filed and never intended that it be opened again. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I told her it was over," Riggins said. "I told her I wanted no 
discussion of the past unless she wanted to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
If only locking away the memories were as easy as filing away those papers. 
</P>
<P>
Perry has left her hometown of Brookhaven, Miss., for a new life in Southern 
California with her father and his second wife. She has transferred from 
Northeast Louisiana University to finish her college basketball career at San 
Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
She has shown that the troubled years have not diminished her skills, coming 
within one player of making the 1988 gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic team. She 
has broken off relations with her mother and others who she believes served her 
poorly during that earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
She has changed her life in many ways, but she knows that her past always will 
shape her future. Few can go through what Perry did and not be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back on it all, I had to grow up fast," Perry said. "I never 
understood what I had done to deserve all of this. All I ever wanted to do was 
to play basketball and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she is getting the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, a 6-foot 4-inch senior center, is the leader of a 14-0 Aztec team that 
is ranked 12th in the country and plays at No. 10 Cal State Long Beach at 7:30 
tonight for sole possession of first place in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Perry is third in the country in scoring at 28.7 points a game, fourth in 
rebounding at 14.1, and is coming off a career-high 45-point performance in a 
94-80 victory over Fresno State Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
That victory raised San Diego State's Big West record to 5-0 and set up 
tonight's showdown against the 49ers (10-4 and 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
"Chana has assumed the role of a dominant player," Riggins said. "She is in the 
role that all All-Americans should be in: She is taking her team to a season 
such as the one we are having, one that perhaps will take us to the Big West 
Conference championship and a place in the postseason (National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.) tournament." 
</P>
<P>
One that might begin to wash away some of Perry's hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Hers is a story of all that can go wrong in college athletics. One that has 
been called by Michael Gilleran, a former NCAA investigator who now is 
commissioner of the West Coast Athletic Conference, the worst case he saw in 
his years as an enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1986, Perry's case led to a 1-year probation for Northeast 
Louisiana, the school Perry attended before she was declared ineligible to play 
for the Lady Indians 10 games into her sophomore season. It was the first NCAA 
penalty levied against a women's program in any sport and the only one that 
ever barred a women's basketball team from postseason play. The school was 
found guilty of violations regarding improper transportation, lodging, 
inducements and contact. 
</P>
<P>
Some close to Perry see what happened as a tragedy and call her a hero. Others 
see her as a victim and continue to rail against those they say took advantage 
of her. A few even see her for what she is: a woman, just turned 22, within 
striking distance of becoming the first from a broken family of 10 to earn a 
college degree, while enjoying a senior season she could have only dreamed 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I've always wished for Chana," said Linda Harper, her coach at 
Northeast Louisiana. "After all she has gone through, she deserves some good to 
come into her life." 
</P>
<P>
Shuttled from parent to parent, reared in an impoverished home, thrust into the 
middle of a recruiting battle that pitted father against mother, coach against 
coach and ultimately mother against daughter, Perry's life turned into a public 
soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
The most intimate details of her personal life were exposed in a $500,000 suit 
brought by her mother, Ruth Antoinette Perry Smith, in August of 1984. Smith 
sued Northeast Louisiana and an assistant coach, Joy Shamburger, in Lincoln 
County (Miss.) Chancery Court. The suit charged that during her recruitment, 
Shamburger began a lesbian relationship with Perry, while she was a minor, and 
that the school condoned Shamburger's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Shamburger was fired in May of 1985, at the end of Perry's freshman season. The 
suit was settled out of court in April of 1987. Perry's mother received a cash 
payment, details of which cannot be disclosed because of the terms of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Settling the family differences has proved more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the suit led to an estrangement from her mother that has lasted 
3 years. She said she has not returned to Brookhaven, nor seen the three 
youngest of her seven half-brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Of her mother, she said: "I think about her, and I love her because she is my 
mother. But that doesn't mean I have to like what she did. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was doing it to help me, but of the money from the settlement, I 
didn't get any of it. I didn't want the money. I just wanted it to be over. The 
money was the least of my concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the day it was first in the newspaper, I wanted to hide somewhere. 
I had just gotten out of class, walked into my room and my roommate came in and 
asked me if I had seen the paper. 'Why are we in the paper? No you are in the 
paper. I don't think you want to see this before we go to practice.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, 'Oh my God!' That's all I remember saying, 'Oh my God!' I went to 
practice, and I was sure everyone had read the article. They didn't know what 
to say to me, what to do. That first day was the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure people stared at me after that, but I couldn't hide. I had to get on 
with my life. I tried to do the best I could. But to be ridiculed and laughed 
at and embarrassed was something that took a long time to get over, and, at 
times, it still messes me up." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said she has done her best to put those times behind her. She has tried 
to make a new start since she left Northeast Louisiana and announced plans to 
transfer to San Diego State in April of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The move has brought her closer to her father, Curtis Perry -- no relation to 
the former pro basketball player of the same name -- who lives with his second 
wife in Los Angeles. Perry had lived on and off with her father since her 
parents were divorced when she was 6, but this is the first time since Perry's 
mother moved her and two sisters back to Mississippi when Perry was 13 that she 
has come to call Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins recruited Perry when she was in high school, and he remembers the 
experience with trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get out of there fast enough," Riggins recalled. " . . . I knew 
right then I wasn't going to recruit her anymore. I wasn't going to get 
involved in that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
But Riggins said he kept in touch with Curtis Perry frequently during his 
daughter's troubles at Northeast Louisiana and shared a common background, 
because both had played high school basketball in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said she wanted to stay at Northeast Louisiana, where she had helped lead 
the team to the Final Four as a freshman. But when the NCAA forbade her playing 
there, San Diego State provided a way for Perry to remain close to her father 
and to quietly regain her footing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go through the hassles of being recruited again," Perry said. 
"And I told my dad that if San Diego State is where he wanted me to go, then 
that is where I would go. I was tired of moving. I figured I came this far, 
let's stay." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he did not hesitate to accept Perry, even though he realized her 
past could prove controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, I felt that Chana could do something for us," Riggins 
said. "But I always felt we could do something for her. It has been 
accomplished for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship got off to a rough start. No sooner had she enrolled for 
the fall semester in 1986 than she got into an argument with Riggins. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins wanted her to sit out her first season to concentrate on her schoolwork 
before completing her final 2 seasons of basketball eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Perry wanted to play that first year, basketball being what she loved most. 
It took some convincing by Riggins before Perry agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"After all that had happened to me, it was hard to trust anybody," Perry said. 
"People I had thought were my friends were not my friends anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be Chana, who that was I was not sure. But for the first 
time, I just wanted to do something that I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
She sat out the year and came back last season to lead the Aztecs to their 
first winning season in 3 years, 21-10. She shared conference 
player-of-the-year honors with Penny Toler of Long Beach, ranked 17th in the 
country in scoring at 23.2 points, and sixth in rebounding at 12.6. 
</P>
<P>
That earned her an invitation to tryouts for the Olympic team. She finished as 
the 13th player on a 12-woman roster. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so frustrated," she said. "It was like, what else could happen to me 
now," Perry said. "The Olympics were a dream I had from the time I started 
playing basketball. At first, I told myself I would never try out again. It was 
like a big chunk of my life was pulled out, and I didn't want to go through 
that again. But the more I thought about, I figured I'd give it one more shot. 
I'd love to end my career on the 1992 Olympic team." 
</P>
<P>
And the experience probably helped her as a basketball player, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As a person, it brought her back in touch with some of the players and friends 
she had left behind. One of those was Tommy Goodson, her coach at Brookhaven 
High, now an assistant coach at Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson accepted the job at LSU after Perry's senior season and tried to to 
persuade her to sign with LSU. 
</P>
<P>
They had split, bitterly, when Perry decided that Goodson had sided with her 
mother in their dispute and had been out of contact until Goodson and his wife 
sent a note to the trials, offering Perry their best wishes. It was the 
Goodsons' first attempt to mend the damage with Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Perry responded favorably and letters and telephone calls have followed. 
</P>
<P>
The years have made Goodson reflective. He said he made mistakes and the one 
who was harmed most was Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Others have not found it as easy to renew their ties with Perry. She has not 
seen her mother since she left for California. She has not heard from 
Shamburger in 3 years, and Charles Domino, her coach with a traveling team in 
New Orleans during high school summers, has not had been in contact with Perry 
since her move. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said she believes Domino is among those who acted contrary to her best 
interests. She said he tried to keep her father from intervening on her behalf. 
But Domino defends his role in the matter, and wonders if a day will come when 
all can be forgiven between him and Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to talk to her now that she is grown up," he said. "I'm so glad she 
has given Tommy a second chance. We're all entitled to a mistake. I hope that 
all of this is behind her now. Let it stay in the past." 
</P>
<P>
That is one wish he and Perry still share.

UC IRVINE TENNIS PLAYERS SURVIVE CLOSE CALL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three UC Irvine tennis players survived a close call Saturday night when a 
faulty heater in their Newport Beach apartment leaked carbon monoxide gas. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kaplan, Richard Lubner and Mike Saunders were treated and released from 
area hospitals after feeling ill when they awakened Sunday morning. The players 
got up at 8 a.m. because they were supposed to participate in a clinic for high 
school coaches at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
That might have saved their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We all woke up with a dry cough and the same aches and pains in our lower 
back," Lubner said. "We got up and drove over to the (Irvine) courts to tell 
Coach (Greg) Patton we were sick. Then we went to the (school's) medical 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark sleeps closest to the heater and he felt the worst. I think he was the 
first to say he thought it might be some kind of gas." 
</P>
<P>
Medical center personnel called paramedics, and hospital blood tests revealed 
the carbon monoxide poisoning, which did not reach dangerous levels. 
</P>
<P>
Lubner said one of the paramedics told him they were indeed very fortunate: "He 
said it makes you very, very sleepy, and some guys don't wake up." 
</P>
<P>
The gas company replaced the heating unit Wednesday, Lubner said, but the 
players have not been able to contact their landlord. "What's done is done. . . 
. We don't want to point fingers. We just want to get back to tennis," he said.

SCOTT OSTLER: PROPOSAL 42 UNFAIR TO THOSE WANTING A PRO SPORTS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You want to be a doctor. You've always had a talent for helping sick people. 
You have become a legend in your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, that boy can heal," you've heard people say in awe as they watch you down 
at the playground, helping a kid with a cut or a bird with a broken wing. 
</P>
<P>
Your life's dream is to be like the wonderful doctors you've seen on TV. That's 
all you want, you are obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
You're not ready to be a doctor yet, of course. You will have to learn the 
specific skills, practice on animals and cadavers. But once you have 
demonstrated that you know what goes where, you'll be right there in the big 
room, baby, under the lights and up to your elbows in goo and gall bladders. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: Society has decreed that if you are to become a surgeon, you must 
first go to rodeo school for a few years. That's fine. You'll give it a try, 
because you will do almost anything to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a new catch. You must first qualify for the rodeo school by 
demonstrating a minimal skill at riding bulls, roping steers and speaking 
cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a problem, because you grew up in Beverly Hills and if you climbed onto 
a horse or bull, you wouldn't know which end to face. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, those are the rules. 
</P>
<P>
OK, enough silliness, but now do you understand why Proposal 42 sucks lemons? 
</P>
<P>
Under current rules, before an athlete is allowed to compete in college, he or 
she must meet certain academic requirements. If he meets only some of the 
requirements, he can still attend the university, but must spend his first year 
studying and not playing ball. 
</P>
<P>
Fine. But with Proposal 42, you must meet all the requirements or you don't 
enter the pearly gates of Hoop U or Pigskin State. 
</P>
<P>
The reason this is a bad proposal is that in America, if you want to play 
professional football or basketball, you must first play college ball. This 
system works beautifully for the colleges, which get cheap athletic labor, and 
for the pro teams, which get a free farm system. 
</P>
<P>
It does not work to the advantage of the athlete, but he doesn't get a vote. 
</P>
<P>
You can't deny an obviously talented athlete the right to pursue his 
professional goals simply because he lacks skills in a totally unrelated area 
-- academics. 
</P>
<P>
Those who defend Proposal 42 lay this one on us: "College is not for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
True, but as long as playing college ball is the only entry to pro football and 
basketball, college should be for just about everybody who shows potential to 
become a pro athlete. 
</P>
<P>
And the way our society is structured, the best athletes tend to come from the 
worst academic environments. 
</P>
<P>
If we're worried about protecting the academic integrity of our universities, 
we can do this: Once we admit these scholastically-marginal athletes, we can 
actually educate them. 
</P>
<P>
Many college coaches and administrators secretly subscribe to the Wet Paint 
Theory: If a ballplayer is enrolled in college 4 or 5 years, even if he never 
attends a class or even learns to read, at least some learning and 
sophistication rubs off on him, like wet paint. 
</P>
<P>
The kid is allowed to major in Square Dance, because the coach doesn't care if 
the player learns to read William Shakespeare, let alone William Cosby. This is 
not education, it is a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
It is also exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
If we let a youngster into Hoop U and sell a lot of tickets and make the school 
rich and famous, we have a moral obligation to attempt to educate him. Not 
necessarily in the field of nuclear physics, but not in Square Dance, either. 
We can at least make the kid literate and employable by a company other than 
the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
School, player and society all benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Some kids can't or won't learn, but remember what the character portraying 
Garfield High School calculus teacher Jaime Esalante said in the movie "Stand 
And Deliver." He said, "Students will rise to the level of our expectations," 
or something like that. And he proved it. 
</P>
<P>
Because Proposal 42 could be killed in a re-vote, let's try this: 
</P>
<P>
Let the coach of Hoop U recruit and sign whomever he wants. Once the budding 
young star is in school, he or she must maintain a minimal achievement level in 
academics, even if it's in remedial classes, or be suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
If suspended, he cannot be replaced on the team roster by anyone but himself 
until after his class graduates. 
</P>
<P>
If he is suspended, athlete and coach would suffer, thus creating a strong 
double motivation for improving the lad's grades. 
</P>
<P>
If a basketball coach gets down to four eligible players, he would tend to 
develop an interest in his players' school work. 
</P>
<P>
With this plan, would inner-city kids and those from low economic backgrounds 
get filtered out of college sports? Not unless we stop keeping track of Hoop 
U's wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
OK, the plan has a flaw or two, but it beats 42.

SHE IS INDEED A SURVIVOR

When Norma Williams heard last month that a fearsome collision between two 
black-and-white police cars had killed three Los Angeles officers and widowed a 
young wife, the shock and sadness she had felt Oct. 31, 1985, washed over her 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that night three years ago that her husband of 17 years, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Thomas C. Williams, was gunned down. And "each time we lose an 
officer . . . it brings it all back again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This was no ordinary police shooting. Williams, 42, was killed at his son's 
Canoga Park school by a career criminal who fired 17 shots with an automatic 
pistol. The assassination was in retaliation for routine testimony Williams 
gave against his killer, Daniel S. Jenkins, in a robbery case that day in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In the three years since, Norma Williams has shown that she, too, is anything 
but ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Canoga Park woman has helped her young son Ryan recover from 
the trauma of seeing his father die, and she has become active in the Police 
Department's support group for officers' survivors. She has taken an intense 
interest in the courtroom proceedings that have so far convicted two of the 
five accused in the assassination plot. 
</P>
<P>
And she has done all of that, her friends say, with characteristic 
determination and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day has been hard for her," said childhood friend Yvonne Lewandowski, 
who now lives in Valencia. "Every time I see her, every time we talk, there's 
the loneliness, the hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Lewandowski said tears flow at times. "But Norma will let it out, and then 
she'll recharge her batteries and get back in there. She's no quitter." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Williams was a man who loved family camping trips, who helped coach his 
son's soccer games and who laughed at his wife's jokes. In proceedings at Los 
Angeles Superior Court, Williams has seen all that, the life of a man, reduced 
to official evidence: ballistics data, coroner's reports and detailed 
descriptions of meetings during which the crime was planned. 
</P>
<P>
It was also in the Van Nuys courtroom, blocks away from the Williams' first 
home, where she learned that Jenkins had at one point considered the execution 
of other family members. 
</P>
<P>
"She's there in the courtroom, not only for herself, but also for us and for my 
dad," said Susie Williams, 19. "No matter what she sees in court, she's 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult experience for Williams has been the discovery that 
the justice system that her slain husband dutifully defended is not always 
considerate of crime victims' survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers succeeded in barring her from attending most of the trial of 
Jenkins and co-conspirator Ruben A. (Tony) Moss, which opened last January, 
because she was considered by prosecutors to be a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
From February to the trial's end in June she had to settle for detailed, daily 
reports from a friend inside the courtroom. She also quizzed Deputy Dist. 
Attys. Richard P. Jenkins and William Gravlin, who prosecuted the case, and 
major crimes Detective Michael Thies, who investigated it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins was convicted and sentenced to death for planning and executing the 
murder of Tom Williams. Moss, a Jenkins lieutenant who knew about the plot, was 
convicted and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. (Three other 
men are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder; their trial 
started in November and is expected to last until March.) 
</P>
<P>
When Jenkins was sentenced last September, Norma Williams told the court about 
her husband, the man, the lover, the friend. But she had to fight for that 
right too. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was told the night before Jenkins' formal sentencing that she would 
not be allowed to make her statement, a right guaranteed her by the 1982 
California Victims' Bill of Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
She was told that a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Booth vs. 
Maryland had superseded California law in death-penalty cases and that 
statements from survivors could not be considered before sentencing. Williams 
was allowed to make a statement to the court, but only after the formal 
sentencing had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense portrayed Jenkins as a loving father, a guy who would do anything 
for his children, who was torn up when his grandmother died," said Williams 
bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
"They are allowed to seek sympathy. Then why can't the victims have that equal 
right to give a character reference for their loved one? Each side should be 
given equal consideration." 
</P>
<P>
When Moss was formally sentenced Dec. 15, Williams was there again. This time, 
because the jury had given Moss a maximum sentence of life in prison without 
the possibility of parole, Williams was allowed to make a statement before Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith M. Ashmann imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Moss, you deserve everything you've got coming to you," she said, looking 
into the eyes of the young man who sat less than 10 feet away. "You are a 
calculating, cold-blooded murderer, and you deserve every bit of pain and 
anguish coming to you all the days of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Williams has tried on her own to restore routine family life, to 
soothe a hurt and to fill an emptiness that will never truly be soothed nor 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks after the killing, Williams and her family were under 
continuous police guard. When police became convinced that the assassins had 
been arrested, the guard left. But the terror continued in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
The past three years were rough for Ryan Williams, now 10. There were incidents 
of shoplifting, of lying, of destroying his belongings. "It frightened me 
because I didn't know how long it would go on," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was 6 when his father was killed, is still in therapy. His father 
was picking up Ryan from First Baptist Church school in Canoga Park, and he 
probably saved his son's life when he yelled at him to duck. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Williams said Ryan gradually "has evolved from being a very angry little 
boy to being a very loving, very social little boy." 
</P>
<P>
She has tried to do her husband's job, as an active team mother for Ryan, who 
is developing his father's broad shoulders and long legs and becoming quite a 
presence on the peewee football field. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not easy. Ryan, Williams said, "is really having a rough time not 
having a dad." 
</P>
<P>
And, now that her children's shock has passed, "they are more aware of the 
emptiness without their father." 
</P>
<P>
One source of understanding and friendship during the past 3 years has been the 
Los Angeles' Police Department's Family Support Group. The group was formed to 
help surviving spouses and children of police officers who die, whether or not 
it is in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
When she heard about the deaths of Police Officers Derrick C. Connor, 28, 
Manuel Gutierrez Jr., 26, and David Hofmeyer, 25, the morning of Dec. 11, 
Williams was quick to call Detective Kena Brutsch, the department's liaison to 
the group. Connor and Gutierrez had been single. But, Williams learned, Lynn 
Hofmeyer was 5 months pregnant with the couple's first child. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours after the death of a police officer, Brutsch visits a surviving 
spouse to determine what the group might to do help out. Then Brutsch contacts 
Williams and another group member, and they pass the news along to the rest of 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Contribution 
</P>
<P>
Part of Williams' involvement is to return the concern the support group has 
shown her. But she also knows that she has something she alone can contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"What I bring to that new widow is that basic experience that no one else could 
understand," she said several days before the Police Department's latest 
tragedy. "I feel good that I'm able to express myself and let her know that the 
feelings she's feeling or going to be feeling are very normal." 
</P>
<P>
Brutsch said the wives of police officers are often overshadowed by their 
husband's careers and that, when a police officer dies, "the first goal is to 
get the ladies to feel better about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The second goal is to help the women see that they still have a future and to 
help them seize control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Within the support group, Brutsch said, Williams is a "natural leader" and 
openly talks about her feelings and about her husband. Such openness, Brutsch 
said, has helped other women in the group to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Verna's husband, Paul, was murdered in 1983 while stopping a car for a 
traffic violation. It was Verna who came to the Williams' house, representing 
the family support group, soon after Tom's death, and during the past three 
years, she and Williams have become fast friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Norma's faced everything with a lot of intelligence," said Verna, 39, of 
Thousand Oaks. "She was not afraid to ask for help. She was not afraid to ask, 
'What did you do in this situation?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Col. Roger Rowe, who grew up with Tom Williams in Van Nuys and was 
his closest friend, said the most important change he has observed in Norma 
Williams is "the way she has taken the helm." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said that before his death Tom Williams was clearly in charge in the 
Williams house. Even now, his gold-plated badge, service revolver and other 
keepsakes are prominently displayed in the family living room, along with 
pictures of him taken during various stages of his 13-year Police Department 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has surprised herself as well. She said that four years ago she never 
would have thought of herself planning a major home expansion and renovation 
that is nearing completion. Or planning to push for legislation that would make 
killing a police officer a federal crime punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
(A number of states, including California, Texas, Florida and Maryland, have 
such a law on the books. But, according to Susan Sawyer, the executive director 
of Maryland-based Concerns of Police Survivors, not all states follow the 
directives of the laws.) 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she imagines conversations that she might have had with her 
husband. "I can honestly say that the reason I have maintained my strength is 
Tom, Susie and Ryan," she said. "They are my source of strength. My friends 
have helped me evolve, but everything I have done has been with the thought of 
Tom." 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearing calm and determined, Williams said she feels the stress. The 
Christmas holidays, she said, were particularly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
But she is confident that her time will come. She holds a degree in counseling 
from Cal State Northridge, and worked for a number of years in personnel before 
her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
Pensions and insurance policies have left her financially comfortable, but 
eventually Williams would like to return to work, to establish another 
relationship, to see her children grow up and provide her with grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever happens, she intends to see the legal process through. She has 
attended several sessions of the second trial, of Reecy Cooper, 33, Voltaire 
Williams, 25, and Duane Moody, 30. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges that the first two had agreed to murder Williams for 
Jenkins but then backed out, and that Moody assisted in the plot in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to appear at every appeal and every hearing for Jenkins and Moss and 
even, she hopes, at Jenkins' eventual execution. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope my input will have some value," she said. "I definitely would not just 
tuck it away and say, 'Well, it's over and done with.' It's not over. It will 
never be over."

EXTENDING THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARNOLDS ARE MOM AND DAD TO 16 CHILDREN, AND THEIR HOUSE HAS BEEN A HOME TO 
MANY MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Bill and Judi Arnold decided to add to their family of four daughters 
seventeen years ago, they hoped to adopt a baby boy. Six boys and six girls 
later, the Arnold family numbers 18. And that doesn't include the 100 or so 
foster children who have lived temporarily in the couple's Sunland home since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
The first child the couple took in was a 15-month-old girl who suffered from 
fetal alcohol syndrome and parental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I took one look at her and said 'This is it,' " Judi, 40, recalled. "The 
doctor said, 'She's going to die, but take her home to die because we don't 
want her to die here.' When I put her back in the car, I said, 'No, I'm not 
going to take her home to die." 
</P>
<P>
The Arnolds nursed her back to health, and today that baby, named Sara, is 17 
and looking forward to college. Bill and Judi were her foster parents until 
they adopted her at age 8. 
</P>
<P>
Seated at a large oak dining room table in their nine-bedroom home, Judi ran 
down her list of children -- nine of whom were adopted and three of whom are 
under the Arnolds' guardianship -- giving ages and nationalities. Bill, 46, had 
just arrived from his job as department manager at a Montrose Vons. 
</P>
<P>
Children came and went as she talked: Three toddlers in the kitchen were 
blowing whistles and chewing on licorice sticks, a girl flew past the picture 
window on a skateboard, two brothers asked if they could watch TV and a 
half-dozen teen-agers tramped up and down the stairs to answer the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Judi listed her biological daughters -- Ronda, 24; Robin, 23; Kimberly, 19, and 
Christina, 17. Ronda and Robin, who live in Pasadena, are the only children who 
have moved out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Then Judi named her adopted children. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, 15, ("Mr. Personality"), was adopted at 13 months, two years after the 
couple took in Sara. 
</P>
<P>
"Then came Gina," Judi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gina, a Vietnamese girl, now 19, was airlifted from Da Nang through "Operation 
Baby Lift" at the end of the Vietnam War when she was 5. The couple saw the 
polio-stricken girl on a TV show that featured adoptive children with medical 
problems. Gina, who was 10 then, had been through two foster homes and several 
schools geared toward the severely disabled, which, according to Judi, had 
hindered her education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Carried Some Clout' 
</P>
<P>
The couple adopted Christian, a half-Navajo, half-Caucasian girl, now 8. Judi 
said proudly that it is unusual for a Caucasian couple to adopt an American 
Indian child. "We never really knew how it happened, but we knew we carried 
some clout," Judi said of Christian's adoption seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Arnolds next offered to adopt De Andre and Michael, 10- and 11-year-old 
half brothers who are black. Judi said county officials were hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
"But I said, 'Oh, come on,' and they said, 'Oh, we can't do that.' And I said, 
'We'll just do it anyway.' And we did." The adoption of De Andre and Michael 
was finalized two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Warner, the boys' caseworker with the Los Angeles County Department of 
Children's Services, said every effort was made to place the boys with black 
families. But because the Arnolds "have an ability to deal with differences and 
to focus on a child's individual needs," the children were placed with them. 
</P>
<P>
Judi then talked about Maria, a 3-year-old Mexican girl who was adopted two 
years ago. She was not expected to walk because she has spina bifida, an 
opening at the base of the spine, which frequently cripples children. But, 
although she may need a shunt implant to keep her spinal fluid circulating, 
Maria now walks. 
</P>
<P>
Judi then mentioned Jahar and Leslie. Jahar, a 3-year-old boy adopted through a 
private agency in Chatsworth specializing in children from India, was adopted 
two years ago. Leslie, a 4-year-old boy, was adopted two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Judi said a shortage of families willing to adopt "special-needs" 
children was what prompted them to expand their family. 
</P>
<P>
The constant shuffling of unwanted children through foster homes and 
institutions also spurred them, Bill said, adding that one of their adopted 
children had been through seven foster homes and a boy's home in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, who said the county has worked with "a handful of other families that 
have adopted many different ethnic children," described the Arnold family as 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unique Family' 
</P>
<P>
"They are a unique family because they contribute tremendously to enrich their 
children's lives," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of legal entanglements, the couple have no plans to adopt the two 
sisters and a brother -- Joy, Abby, and Ryan -- ages 6, 7, and 10, under their 
legal guardianship. They said the children will probably remain with them until 
each turns 18. The Arnolds are even considering adopting another baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Arnold children attend five different schools. On Sundays, they attend St. 
James Catholic Church in Tujunga in shifts. "They're pretty overwhelmed," Judi 
said of parishioners who see the family en masse at Christmas and Easter 
Masses. "You have to remember that we're in a predominantly Caucasian 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Father Richard Henry, an associate pastor of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in 
Paramount who once served as pastor for the Arnolds, said "sometimes it's a 
three-ring circus" at the Arnold household, "and it's never dull." 
</P>
<P>
"They help the kids develop discipline and they have a real love," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple divide their time among the children as best they can. "It's more or 
less first come, first served," Bill said. "Whoever comes screaming first, gets 
what they want." 
</P>
<P>
Each child must do two chores a day, which is "a lot of responsibility," said 
Brian, who added that he and Sara often help with the smaller children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everybody Helps Out 
</P>
<P>
"Someone changes diapers, someone cooks dinner and with everybody helping out, 
it takes the hassle out of doing it," Brian said. "Sometimes I disagree with 
somebody, but a lot of times I get along." 
</P>
<P>
Christina said that many of her friends, who call her brothers and sisters "the 
seven continents," don't have brothers and sisters of their own and like to 
visit her house. "I'd rather live here because my friends get lonely," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Judi, who begins her day at 5 a.m., said the entire clan usually gathers for 
meals. The dining room table seats 16, and there is an extra table nearby. "It 
probably doesn't take me any longer to make dinner than the average mother with 
two kids," she said. "Maybe I'm used to it, I don't know. I know others view us 
as an oddity, but we don't." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, people stare at the four shopping carts of groceries she packs into 
her van each week. Her husband, who invests in the stock market, estimates that 
their food bill is $1,000 per month. The only assistance the couple receives is 
for Michael and De Andre -- $300 a month from the county for the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Arnold said his children have not encountered racial problems at home, at 
school or in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at Sara and De Andre, who smiled and said, "We're pals," with their 
arms draped over each other's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"Adults make racial problems, kids don't," Bill said. "A child has no 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
The Arnold children are exposed to their cultural roots through organizations 
like Bal Jagat in Chatsworth, which arranged Jahar's adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Hemlata Momaya, who founded the agency that specializes in Indian adoptions, 
said the Arnold children seem to be adjusting well to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times you can't tell which children they have adopted," Momaya said. "And 
it is good to see how the older children take care of the younger children." 
</P>
<P>
In the Arnolds' dining room, as more children entered from all corners of the 
house, a chorus of requests, all beginning with "Mom!" could be heard. The 
loudest came from Brian, who asked, "Mom! What's for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
While attending to Maria, who tugged on her belt, and Leslie, who demanded more 
licorice, Judi Arnold looked her son square in the eye and deadpanned, "I 
haven't got that far yet."

THE NEW: A KOOSH PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can squish it, you can throw it, you can take out your aggressions on it. 
What is it? It's a Koosh Ball, and it's not really a ball. It's a soft, 
porcupine-ish toy made up of thousands of rubber filaments radiating from a 
central core. "We can't keep them in stock," says Hilda Tellez, manager of the 
Power of Play in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Koosh Ball, which sells for between $5 and $12, depending on size, appeals 
to adults and children. "People like its texture," Tellez says. "It's almost 
like a sea urchin. It feels prickly on your hand. It's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Kids have seized upon the collectibility of the toy. "Kids love them," she 
says. "Kids collect them because they come in two different sizes and all 
different colors, ranging from pastels to primaries." 
</P>
<P>
At Victor's Toys in Reseda, manager Ann Kim agrees. "Children really think that 
it's special," she says. "They usually always buy three or four at a time." 
</P>
<P>
But adults like to "koosh" for a very adult reason: Stress relief. "A lot of 
adults like to throw Koosh Balls at each other in the office," Tellez says. 
"It's fun for them, and they know it's safe -- since it's not a real ball, they 
know it's not going to break anything." 
</P>
<P>
Maddening rush-hour traffic gets "kooshed" away, too. "I had one person come in 
and say, 'Oh, this will be great when I'm sitting on the freeway. I can 
concentrate on this ball rather than the traffic,' " Tellez adds. 
</P>
<P>
The ball has other practical uses, as Kim has found. "It's great for holding up 
a book when you read," she says.

BUSH CAMPAIGN MANAGER BOOKS BIG BLUES AND SOUL LINEUP FOR INAUGURAL FLING

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Carter had the Allman Brothers Band help kick off his Peanut Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan had Frank Sinatra swing open the gates of the Silver Screen White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
And now George Bush will enter his presidency to the sounds of . . . Bo 
Diddley. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Diddley? 
</P>
<P>
Bush's nationally televised pre-inaugural festivities tonight will feature 
Sinatra, as well as mainstreamers like Randy Travis and Julio Iglesias (See 
story, Page 8). But perhaps the most intriguing of the 11 parties slated for 
this weekend as part of the inaugural celebration will be Saturday night's 
rhythm and blues extravaganza at the Washington Convention Center featuring the 
likes of Diddley and fellow blues and soul notables Etta James, Albert Collins, 
Delbert McClinton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Joe Cocker and Willie Dixon. (The show 
will be taped for possible future broadcast and/or audio release with proceeds 
to benefit an as-yet-undetermined charity.) 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: The name George Herbert Walker Bush does not bring to mind 
rhythm and blues. But this part of the festivities is not Bush's doing. The 
person behind it is Lee Atwater, Bush's presidential campaign manager and the 
new chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been my real love," said the 37-year-old Columbia, S.C., native 
from his busy Washington office. "We ran a very tough campaign, and every day I 
tried to jog. And while I was jogging, to keep my mind on something, I would 
dream about the ultimate concert. So after the Vice President got elected, I 
went to the inaugural people, and they said, 'If you want to do that, we'll use 
it for the youth gala.' " 
</P>
<P>
(One of two parties on Saturday night, tickets to the R&amp;B show were sold 
out the quickest of all the inaugural galas. A total of 8,500 people are 
expected to attend.) 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt about Atwater's sincerity -- he's not only a fan, but a 
musician too. He played guitar with a number of different Southern soulsters in 
the '60s, including Percy ("When a Man Loves a Woman") Sledge, who will perform 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But might there be any political intent in having a youth-oriented inaugural 
ball that, in Atwater's words, is a "tribute to the black musical experience 
and roots?" 
</P>
<P>
After all, Atwater is generally credited with the hardball tack of the Bush 
campaign, including the frequent references to furloughed Massachusetts 
murderer Willie Horton, an issue that alienated many in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope there is (political gain from the show) -- I'm a politician," Atwater 
said. "But if there isn't, so what? I think it's a good thing to do, and it'll 
be fun and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Moore, of Sam &amp; Dave fame, thinks the show is a smart move for the 
incoming Administration. "It's going to help close the gap as far as white and 
black," said Moore, who will be performing Saturday. "The Republicans are going 
to throw their tongues out and say, 'See, you Democrats, we're not as 
closed-minded as you think!' " 
</P>
<P>
Bo Diddley concurred. "This concert is going to get a lot of people shaking 
hands who never thought they'd be shaking hands before," the Florida-based 
Diddley said, though he acknowledged that some of Bush's policies may be at 
odds with his own views, if not the black culture of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't impressed me, but he might trick us all and do a good job," Diddley 
opined. "Let's give the man a chance. If he messes up, he blows it." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians, however, are stopping far short of hailing this event as 
signaling a new era of understanding between Republicans and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for Lee saying, 'This is the kind of music I want coming 
through this channel,' I don't think it would have gotten through," said Moore. 
</P>
<P>
But there is praise aplenty for Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing Columbia, S.C.," recalled white Texas R&amp;B singer Delbert 
McClinton, one of the several participants who will be representing Bush's 
adopted home state, "and Lee came backstage and introduced himself and started 
talking blues. It freaked me out. We talked for about 30 minutes, and he knows 
as much or more than I do about R&amp;B. You figure it. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the participating performers want politics to take a back seat 
Saturday. To hear them talk, you'd think their music -- as well as a new 
President -- was being inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just out-and-out the right time for music to change in high 
places," said McClinton. "I would never have thought 25 years ago that some of 
these people, much less myself, would be playing at an inauguration for the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
"If any truths can be reached through this music and its involvement with the 
government, so be it," McClinton continued. "Yeah for truth! Let's have more of 
it. But that's as political as I get. There's no boundaries with R&amp;B, or 
music. . . . This music has been around for a long time, and for some reason at 
the Inauguration we are celebrating it widely." 
</P>
<P>
According to Billy Preston, the show's musical director, there are no plans for 
speeches or the use of particularly pointed songs to try to get a message 
across to the new President. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a musician -- I don't dwell in politics," Preston said. "The music will 
sell its message itself." 
</P>
<P>
But Preston said that he is considering writing a song especially for the 
event. And he did have a couple of suggestions for soul numbers that could 
serve as the evening's themes. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Try a Little Tenderness,' " he said. "Or 'Respect' -- yeah, let's use 
'Respect!' " 
</P>
<P>
And finally, it had to be asked: Will this be a kinder, gentler R&amp;B show? 
</P>
<P>
"It'll have kind and gentle moments," Preston said. "And some rough and tough 
ones too."

'INAUGURAL GALA' A STAR-STUDDED PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov. Julio Iglesias. Loretta Lynn and her sister, Crystal Gale. 
Frank Sinatra, who sang at both inaugural galas for Ronald Reagan. Violinist 
Yo-Yo Ma. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose marriage to Maria Shriver affiliates him 
with the Kennedy clan. Nell Carter. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the stars studding "The Presidential Inaugural Gala," a 
two-hour performance to be held in the nation's capital tonight, on the eve of 
the Inauguration of President-elect George Bush and Vice President-elect Dan 
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will televise the event from the Washington Convention Center (8 p.m., 
Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Others participating include: Anita Baker, Hinton Battle, Gregg Burge, Walter 
Cronkite, Susan Jaffe, the Joint Services Honor Guard, Cheryl Ladd, Cissy Lynn, 
Chuck Norris, the Oak Ridge Boys, Robert Peters, Randy Travis, Tommy Tune, U.S. 
Army Herald Trumpets, U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club, Peggy Sue Wright and Chuck 
Yaeger. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very excited about the quality of talent that will be performing in 
the Inaugural Gala," said Penne Percy Korth and Bobby Holt, co-chairmen of the 
American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Inauguration marks the 200th anniversary of presidential Inaugurations, 
beginning with George Washington's in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
"The selections of who was going to be on the show was made by many people; it 
was kind of a group effort," said Don Mischer, producer of the TV gala. "I had 
input, so did the talent people and Penne Korth and Bobby Holt, (along with) 
Joe Canzeri, our executive producer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And George and Barbara Bush? "We received no direct directives from them. We 
did receive a list of people -- some are on, some are not." 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to work out an entertaining show that represented many types of 
entertainment and performance in America," Mischer added. "We wanted country 
music, popular music, Broadway represented, classical music. . . . It's 
extremely difficult, an excruciating task. We have on the show 13 performance 
slots, and six to seven people speak for 45 seconds. Hundreds of artists could 
well have been part of of this." 
</P>
<P>
Because the performance airs from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., the producers lacked the 
flexibility they would have had if the show had gone from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., 
Mischer said. "At 11, the local news starts and we could have run over a bit, 
but (at 10) we're jumping right back into CBS' prime time." 
</P>
<P>
So Randy Travis was trimmed back. And the Mormon Tabernacle had a song cut in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But inaugurals do have their compensations. "No one really turned us down," 
Mischer noted.

Fans of 1950s Western-movie star Rex Allen in Willcox, Ariz., are readying a 
museum of memorabilia and will show his films in a theater next door to mark 
the actor's 50th anniversary in movies. Allen was born in Willcox on Dec. 31, 
1921. He began as a singer and radio announcer and signed his first contract 
with Republic Pictures in 1949. The museum and theater will be in the Railroad 
Avenue District, which has been entered on the federal Register of Historic 
Places. ALEENE MacMINN

NEW YORK CITY'S TWO MONUMENTS TO THE RECENT PAST; 
</P>
<P>
TWO NEW YORK CITY MUSEUMS ARE MONUMENTS TO THE RECENT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK RIZZO, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most museums are sanctuaries of great art, places where people can go to gaze 
upon civilization's most lasting contributions, made significant by time, 
history and luck. 
</P>
<P>
But not all. 
</P>
<P>
Two museums in New York -- one that opened last fall, the other, in the '70s -- 
celebrate a more immediate past. 
</P>
<P>
You could call the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens and the Museum 
of Broadcasting in Manhattan "baby boom museums," for they are places in which 
the pop culture of the most recent generations is presented with care -- and 
fun. Visitors who flock to the two museums may not know art, but they certainly 
know what they like. 
</P>
<P>
The American Museum of the Moving Image, a $15-million facility that opened in 
September and is still undergoing expansion, is in the historic 
Paramount-Astoria Studios, where the Marx Brothers made their early films. 
</P>
<P>
Though there are some hands-on activities (a "magic mirror" shows how visitors 
would look as Indiana Jones, Rocky or Dorothy; a Fairlight MFX console 
demonstrates that a laugh track is no joke), most of the museum is a clever 
collection of stuff ranging from the classic to the kitschy. 
</P>
<P>
There's also an awareness that there's more to movies and television than what 
we see on screens. The museum examines the selling of movies and television 
programs and celebrates the magic of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can check out the scores of dolls (a Flip Wilson-Geraldine doll gives 
you two dolls in one; a Sonny and Cher set almost adds up to one doll in two), 
lunch boxes (Zorro, Fess Parker, "Hogan's Heroes"), fan magazines ("Rita 
Hayworth confesses 12 men I'd take to a desert isle"), coloring books (color 
Rhonda Fleming red), Alan Ladd spoons, William Holden bobby pins, a Gabe Kaplan 
"Welcome Back, Kotter" paper doll set, an Elizabeth Taylor sew-easy fashion 
kit, a "This Is Your Life" home game ("now in your own living room with 
surprise guests and charm bracelet"), a Pinky Lee pull toy, and enough 
knickknacks to fill a campy collector's vault. 
</P>
<P>
Technology also gets its due, with exhibits that show the talent of costumers, 
cinematographers, set designers, special-effects people and the scientists who 
brought us the technology of the moving image in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plenty of costumes on display, some originals, some not. A 
Gianni Versace suit worn by Don Johnson in "Miami Vice" looks somewhat dull in 
real, as opposed to reel, life. A Deanna Durbin dress is frumpy, but a Linda 
Evans "Dynasty" dress looks fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
There's the original set used for Paul Newman's film version of Tennessee 
Williams' "The Glass Menagerie," a special-effects setup for "2010," a latex 
body suit for a "Cocoon" alien and the head of the "Elephant Man." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way there are scale models of the Roxy Theatre and the Whitestone 
Bridge Drive-in, a video sculpture by Nam June Paik and an impressive exhibit 
of early moving-image technology (an 1867 zoetrope, Edison's 1891 kinetograph 
camera and a 1928 GE broadcast television receiver). 
</P>
<P>
The museum also presents such screenings as "Media and the Vietnam War" and a 
salute to Jerry Lewis as well as lecture series ("American Movie Posters 
1910-1950," "Hollywood Still Photographers"). 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan, there is the Museum of Broadcasting. Founded 14 years ago, the 
museum offers programs spanning more than 60 years of radio and television. 
Because it is so popular, it will get a big new home on the west side of town 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Museum of the Moving Image, the Museum of Broadcasting is more an 
archival facility for broadcasting professionals, students, scholars and the 
general public. There is little on show here. The museum's primary function is 
to present special film and video screenings and to be a resource center for 
people interested in television study. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just for video scholars (and come to think of it, what true couch 
potato isn't?). Anyone can visit the archives, check out the card catalogue 
with more than 40,000 items (nicely cross-indexed), and present his selection 
to the librarian, who will summon the tape from the museum's video vault. 
</P>
<P>
Want to see "See It Now" with Edward R. Murrow? How about the 1960 presidential 
debates? Compare Lee J. Cobb's "Death of a Salesman" with Dustin Hoffman's 
interpretation. Is there one "I Love Lucy" episode you've missed and always 
wanted to see? Listen to a "Fireside Chat" by Franklin D. Roosevelt or the 
original "War of the Worlds" by Orson Welles. 
</P>
<P>
The requested show then will be presented on a video screen (or an audio unit) 
for you on one of the museum's 23 consoles. The compartments are available for 
an hour at a time and can accommodate two people. Time is allotted on a 
first-come, first-served basis. (The programs are on loan to the museum and 
cannot be duplicated.) 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the viewing rooms (or listening rooms, if it means radio), where 
special, continuous shows are presented. The radio and video festivals should 
not be missed, either. 
</P>
<P>
The New York World Television Festival began Tuesday and will run through Feb. 
25. Featured in the festival is the American premiere of films based on the 
works of author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 16 award-winning international 
productions and a 20th anniversary salute to the English comedy group Monty 
Python. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than one festival going on at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
There are Saturday screenings for children. Throughout the spring, shows 
featuring characters from Dr. Seuss books, Stuart Little, the Muppets, Tikki 
Tikki Tembo and Maurice Sendak's Rosie will be shown. Kids are also introduced 
to radio shows that might appeal to them. ("The Shadow" knows.) 
</P>
<P>
There is the "Comedy Break" series at lunch time on weekdays, which will 
continue through March 31. Among other subjects, this series takes a look at: 
television's parodying itself (some choice "SCTV" programs); how situation 
comedies look at rock 'n' roll (The "I Dream of Jeannie" show where Jeannie 
assembles a rock band); sophisticated urbanites (1967's "He &amp; She"); the 
premiere episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Rhoda" and "The Bob Newhart 
Show"), and short-lived sitcoms (Remember "Grindl"? "The Pruitts of 
Southampton"? How about "Camp Runamuck"?) 
</P>
<P>
Both museums offer a full schedule of events, screening times and more detailed 
information to those who write or call.

5.0 MALIBU QUAKE ROCKS A WIDE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A magnitude 5 earthquake, centered about eight miles south of Malibu, rocked a 
broad area of Southern California late Wednesday, shaking downtown Los Angeles 
office buildings, shifting beams in at least one Westside home, knocking 
kitchenware from cabinets and causing rockslides in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor was felt from Santa Barbara to San Diego and as far east as San 
Bernardino. Seismologists at Caltech in Pasadena said the epicenter was in the 
same general area of a magnitude 4.6 quake that hit on New Year's Day in 1979 
during the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
A 5.2 quake in the same vicinity hit in 1930, Caltech scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center was hit with a rolling motion at 10:53 p.m., and 
the quake was felt for up to 30 seconds. In Topanga Canyon, the temblor was 
felt as two "very sharp jolts," and diners at a Brentwood restaurant said china 
tumbled to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Reports 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's and Fire departments cited no 
early reports of serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to last about 10 seconds, but it was the most noisy and violent 10 
seconds," said Rick Cziment of Venice. "All the dishes were shaking, and the 
birds were banging into the bars of their cage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the strongest earthquake I've felt in 14 years of living in Los Angeles. 
It actually scared me. Our house went dark. My daughter woke up and began 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
The quake knocked out electrical power to more than 90,000 customers in the San 
Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police helicopters checked 30 main points where heavy damage could 
occur, such as dams, and found no evidence of any damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
officials said there were no reports of major damage. 
</P>
<P>
John Hazard, a box boy at a Vons supermarket on Ventura Boulevard in Woodland 
Hills said, "It felt like a swaying. Everybody ran for cover outside because 
everything was falling on the floor. One aisle was a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Don Desmarteau, manager of Solley's, a Woodland Hills delicatessen, said that 
"everybody jumped out of their booths and seats" once the shaking began. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 customers were in the restaurant when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Erickson, a bartender at Alice's Restaurant in Malibu, said that more than 
"100 bottles fell, and I was ankle deep in broken glass." He added that no one 
was hurt, but that the Malibu Pier was "swaying all over." 
</P>
<P>
He called it the worst quake he had ever felt in the Malibu area. 
</P>
<P>
Eight aftershocks above magnitude 2 were felt in the Santa Monica Bay area 
south of Malibu in the first hour after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said they had yet to identify the fault associated with 
Wednesday's quake, but the 1930 and the 1979 quakes were on what is known as 
the Elysian Park Fault, which underlies downtown Los Angeles.

GUNMAN HAD ATTENDED SCHOOL HE ASSAULTED; 
</P>
<P>
BUT MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR IN ATTACK

Patrick Edward Purdy did not come to the grounds of Cleveland Elementary School 
as a complete stranger. The gunman who raked the school's crowded playground 
with 110 rounds of rifle fire, killing five children and wounding 29 others and 
a teacher before taking his own life, had himself completed kindergarten 
through second grade at Cleveland, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the discovery was not immediately clear. School records 
yielded nothing remarkable about Purdy's experience there, only the normal 
academic promotions and mandatory vaccinations, but the connection did indicate 
that the midday attack Tuesday was not wholly random. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy, an out-of-work welder who variously listed his age as 24 and 26, left 
behind no note or coherent explanation of his actions, and he conducted his 
attack in grim-faced silence. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives seeking to determine Purdy's motive were left Wednesday to pick 
through his bizarre personal effects and down-and-out past: a collection of toy 
soldiers arrayed in mock battle throughout Purdy's motel room, symbols 
scribbled on camouflaged cloth, slogans printed on clothes and weapons, and a 
drifter's resume of briefly held jobs and obsolete addresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Why he did this we may never know," said Capt. Dennis Perry, head of 
investigations for the Stockton Police Department. "We can only assume that 
some problem came up in this guy that made him do it." 
</P>
<P>
For the targets of Purdy's spree, the day after was one of fear and 
incomprehension. Only 227 pupils, roughly one-fourth of the student body, 
showed up for classes. Officials had opened the school with the belief that it 
would be better for the children to deal quickly with their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovery Prospects

<P>
Dr. Mary Gonzales Mend, superintendent of the Stockton Unified School District, 
said it would "take a great deal of time to recover. And we will never recover 
fully." 
</P>
<P>
All 29 of the wounded students and the one wounded teacher appeared out of 
danger on Wednesday. A 6-year-old boy was in serious condition and 17 pupils 
and a teacher were in stable condition. The others were treated at hospitals or 
at the scene and were released. The psychic wounds will prove more troublesome, 
teachers feared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a problem with these kids for a long time," Janet Geng, a 
Cleveland teacher who had been on yard duty when the shooting started, said 
Wednesday from her hospital bed at St. Joseph's Medical Center. She had been 
fleeing to the schoolhouse with a child on each hand when a bullet shattered 
one of her knees. She expected to die as she lay on the ground and listened to 
the bullets whistling overhead and tearing into the asphalt beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"To kids," Geng said, "school is a safe place, but I guess it's not anymore. . 
. . These kids, they are little and they just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
The children who did attend class Wednesday were greeted by escorts who guided 
them through a swarm of reporters and cameras. Counselors were stationed in 
each classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the 
previous day. Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's office. 
Teachers said they did not know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just try to get through the day," said Vicki Braga, who teaches fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Floral Bouquets 
</P>
<P>
The front entrance of the school was decorated with bouquets of yellow 
gladioluses, purple mums and five red roses. Someone had placed there a pink 
teddy bear with angel's wings. A banner stretched across the front of a 
neighboring house read: "Racists Are Ugly -- Let's Stop Them." 
</P>
<P>
The banner's message enunciated an early suspicion that the racial composition 
of the student body might have contributed to Purdy's motivation. More than 600 
of the 980 students are the sons and daughters of refugees from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Police, however, said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he had some feelings against the Southeast Asian community as a whole, 
we haven't determined that," Perry said. ". . . I understand in some 
conversations he spoke about Vietnam, but he's obviously too young to have gone 
to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Mickelsen, a 21-year-old welder who came to know Purdy last year when the 
men worked together for a month, had heard Purdy complain about the high 
percentage of Southeast Asian refugees in industrial arts courses he was taking 
at San Joaquin Delta College here. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't like the idea of jobs being taken away," Mickelsen said of Purdy, 
"and he didn't like having to compete with them in classes." 
</P>
<P>
Mickelsen, however, said the resentment expressed by Purdy was common among the 
outnumbered white students in the classes, and he found it inconceivable that 
Purdy's discontent with the Southeast Asian refugees was strong enough to 
promote the carnage of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to think," Mickelsen said, "to be honest with you. The guy 
wasn't really happy. He wasn't happy with life -- and he did kill himself. And 
it's possible he wanted to be known before he died, known for something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy attended Cleveland Elementary from September, 1969, through November, 
1972. Perry said all the records showed was that "he was there. He was promoted 
through the grades. He had all his shots. His health appeared to be good and 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
His relatives described the blond, lithesome Purdy as a loner who drank as a 
child and who was troubled by his father's death about five years ago in an 
automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why," said Purdy's 
grandmother, 63-year-old Julia Chumbley of Lodi. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, police investigators searched Purdy's room at the El Rancho 
Motel in Lodi. He had checked into the $100-a-week motel, which sits by 
California 99 and advertises truck parking and "XXX movies," on the day after 
Christmas and was paid up through Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Among other items, they found more than 100 plastic toy soldiers arrayed about 
the room, along with toy jeeps and tanks, in what appeared to be an imaginary 
battle scene. Perry said the figurines "were spread out through the entire room 
-- up on top of the drapes, in the shower, one in the freezer, all over the 
place. . . . He obviously had a military hang-up of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Purdy's father served as a Marine in Vietnam, but added that the 
son never seemed to take undue interest in his father's combat experience. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the motel room was a damaged .22-caliber rifle and a piece of cloth 
that was adorned with strange markings: hand-drawn caricatures of scowling 
faces and various cryptic symbols. While police officials could not explain 
what the symbols meant, they said the search in part had been for "anything 
that refers to satanic or problems like that." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said Purdy's arsenal and clothes also revealed odd markings. 
His ammunition bag was marked with the words "Freedom," "humanoids" and "evil." 
On the stock of his rifle was carved "Hezbollah," the name of a pro-Iranian 
terrorist group. Printed on the front of a camouflage shirt he wore Tuesday 
were "PLO," "Libya" and "Earthman." "Freedom" and "Death to the Great Satin," 
an apparently misspelled slogan favored by anti-American Iranians, were printed 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mental State 
</P>
<P>
"It suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur about Iran," 
Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that Purdy had ever received psychiatric treatment. As 
a youth, he was arrested on a number of relatively minor criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Perry said, Purdy's mother, identified by police Wednesday as 
Kathleen Toscano, reported him to Stockton police for allegedly vandalizing her 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason," the police official said, "he and his mother met at a 
drive-in restaurant (and) supposedly he and his half-brother committed some 
malicious mischief to the mother's car. The mother reported them and said they 
wanted money for drugs, and she was tired of giving them money for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Toscano at the time listed her address as a Sacramento post office 
box. The official outcome of her complaint was not known. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelsen said Purdy had told him that "when he was growing up he had a really 
rough time of it. His father died and his mom was an alcoholic, and he hadn't 
seen her for years." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy, by trade a welder, worked in cities across America for short stints. An 
employment application was found in his motel room. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had lived in about every state in the nation, including Hawaii," 
Mickelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived in Southern California 
</P>
<P>
Court records indicate that Purdy lived in Southern California in the early 
1980s. He was placed on probation in 1983 after police who stopped his car for 
showing improper registration discovered nunchaku sticks, a martial arts 
weapon, on the back seat. He told detectives he only kept the weapon "to mess 
around with," and listed his employer as a Hollywood fast food outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Records showed he also was arrested in West Hollywood at about the same time 
for possession of marijuana for sale and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
A North Hollywood man who befriended Purdy in the early 1980s said he met the 
young man at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He said Purdy was unable to stay 
sober for more than two or three days at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are an alcoholic you have to be willing to stop drinking, to get help," 
said the friend, who requested anonymity. "He wouldn't stop drinking." 
</P>
<P>
The friend said Purdy used his address to collect mail. Purdy listed the same 
address on an employment application and it also appeared on a police arrest 
report for Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy acted "like he was hurting inside," the friend said. "Sometimes when you 
hurt inside you want to hurt others."

GORBACHEV PLANS DEFENSE BUDGET CUTBACK OF 14% 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Revealing new details of a planned military cutback, Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that the Soviet defense budget is to be reduced by 
more than 14% and that nearly half of a previously announced cut of 500,000 
troops will come from units in the European part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a wide-ranging meeting, the Soviet leader also challenged U.S., 
West European, and Japanese representatives of the prestigious Trilateral 
Commission to follow the Soviet lead in restructuring what he described as 
outdated thinking about East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perestroika will come to pass," he promised, using the Russian term to 
describe his reform program. "But we expect perestroika from your side as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Among commission members at the meeting were former U.S. Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger, former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former 
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Accounts of their talks were 
broadcast on Soviet television and distributed by the official Soviet news 
agency, Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Neither account made clear the timetable for Gorbachev's promised 14.2% defense 
budget cut. Nor did they explain the basis on which it was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the government has listed defense spending at 20.2 billion rubles 
($33.6 billion) annually for the last three years. However, it admits that its 
figure does not include many items, such as research and the cost of military 
production by civilian industries, which are included in Western defense 
budgets. Various Western estimates put the true Soviet figure as much as three 
times the official one. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the official figure, Gorbachev's announced cutback would amount to 
about $4.8 billion. He said that spending on arms and military technology would 
decrease by even more, by 19.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev announced plans for a unilateral cut of 500,000 troops during a 
dramatic speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 7. In his meeting 
Wednesday, he revealed that 240,000 of those troops will be removed from units 
in the Western part of the country, 200,000 from the East, and 60,000 from the 
Soviet Union's southern borders. 
</P>
<P>
He said the troop reduction is equal to 12% of the total strength of the Soviet 
armed forces, indicating a standing military of about 4.2 million. That is 
significantly fewer than the approximately 5 million troops that Western 
experts say are under arms here. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin chief had also announced at the United Nations that total Soviet 
armed forces in Eastern Europe and the European part of this country will be 
cut within two years by 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat 
aircraft in order to reduce the offensive threat now facing Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he criticized Western speculation that he intended only to get 
rid of outdated tanks. More than half the tanks to be withdrawn are among this 
country's "most advanced" models, Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civilian Conversions 
</P>
<P>
He said 5,000 tanks will be "physically liquidated," while the rest are 
converted "into prime movers for civilian use and into simulators." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, in a speech to a group of intellectuals, artists and 
writers, Gorbachev lamented the effect of the national budget deficit on the 
supply of consumer goods and indicated that one immediate solution was to cut 
military expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
However, there have been indications that some segments of the military oppose 
the cuts. A recent issue of the armed forces ideological journal includes an 
article by an army captain, criticizing unilateral military cuts as 
inappropriate and at odds with government and Communist Party policy. 
</P>
<P>
The former chief of staff, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, whose resignation from 
the top military post for reasons of ill health coincided with Gorbachev's U.N. 
address, has denied that he opposed the cuts but acknowledged this month that 
such opposition might well exist in the army. 
</P>
<P>
On broader issues, Gorbachev urged his Western interlocutors to strive for 
their own "breakthroughs in thinking." He complained that "there is a certain 
lopsidedness in the very wording of the questions asked here: 'How will the 
Soviet Union be changing, as much depends on this?' But how will the West be 
changing? This is also an aspect of no little importance." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has already discovered "that the revision of the way of 
thinking is a painful process," he said. "But this process is indispensable." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev warned against "the temptation to score propaganda victories" in 
international relations. The cardinal lesson of past experience, he said, is 
that "using the old approaches, we have gone too far -- in the area of military 
rivalry, of political confrontation and also in opposing ourselves to others 
economically." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides must "discard primitive cliches," Tass quoted the Soviet leader as 
saying. "We have underestimated (capitalism's) ability to adapt and develop in 
new conditions. We have predicted its early failure. And to this day there are 
many people in the West who view socialism as a stillborn baby of civilization 
and deem it necessary to relegate it to the garbage heap of history." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he called for "new forms of cooperation in the world process. . . . 
Internationalization of problems is needed. This is why we attach such an 
importance to the United Nations organization, which has long been unable to 
bring into play its possibilities. But it has been waiting for its hour, and it 
has come." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the economy, he said the Soviet leadership is "close to taking a 
decision on principle" to join international economic organizations. However, 
he cautioned, "we cannot accept the rules of participation in (organizations 
such as the International Monetary Fund) all at once. . . . The West also 
should adapt to such a partner as the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
He also called for an end to Western "restrictions and bans" on trade. The 
Soviet Union, he noted, has over the past two years "soundly liberalized our 
principles" governing new forms of economic ties -- an apparent reference to 
Moscow's new encouragement of joint ventures here with Western firms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said his country wants to integrate itself into the world economy "in 
phases. . . . It would be tempting to spend away money abroad to quickly 
replenish the market with consumer goods," he said. "But we were not thinking 
of one or two years. We were thinking of creating such an economy as would give 
us both the required amounts and the required quality of output. That is why we 
have invested very heavily in modernizing the entire technological fiber of our 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
The Trilateral Commission is a non-governmental organization uniting prominent 
politicians and businessmen from the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.

REAGAN HINTS AT DIVERTING REFUGEES TO OTHER NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MAY, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan, questioning whether the United States has "come to a point in 
which we just plain can't handle" the continuing waves of immigrants, said 
Wednesday that this country should "collaborate with our allies" on resettling 
refugees elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times and six other newspapers, Reagan said that it 
may be necessary to "redirect refugees to other countries that are willing to 
take them," an idea immediately challenged by immigration experts who said that 
other countries already are handling more than their share of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The President's comments come amid an explosion of immigrants fleeing poverty 
and strife in Latin America, making their way to American cities where social 
services and resettlement operations are already overburdened. At the same 
time, thousands of Soviet citizens and Indochinese are trying to leave their 
homelands, many in search of homes in this country. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30-minute interview in the Oval Office, Reagan appeared relaxed and 
comfortable, discussing a wide range of issues, including U.S.-Soviet 
relations, Central America, U.S. hostages, congressional redistricting and even 
his acting career in Hollywood, asserting that it prepared him for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that, if Gen. Manuel A. Noriega remains in power in Panama, 
this country should "look at" whether to abide by the treaty requiring the 
United States to turn over the canal to Panama by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who leaves office Friday after waging an unsuccessful effort to oust 
Noriega, said that there is "no question about his totalitarianism," adding 
that "I don't think there is any way to escape the fact that he is a part of 
the drug fraternity." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, the question of whether to abide by the treaty "is something 
that should be taken into consideration by whoever is in charge at that time." 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Administration officials have shied away from direct threats 
to abrogate the treaty to increase pressure on Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The President vigorously defended his remarkable change of attitude toward the 
Soviet Union and the new arms control treaty between the two nations, saying, 
"It was the right thing to do." As he has done repeatedly, Reagan credited his 
policy of "peace through strength" with bringing the Soviets to the bargaining 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Conscious that the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the Soviets 
will play a part in determining how history judges his presidency, Reagan, who 
early in his presidency called the Soviet Union "the evil empire," said that 
conservative critics of his Soviet initiative are "wrong because . . . I'm 
motivated by deeds, not just words. And the deeds (by the Soviets) have been 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Verification 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the United States is able to verify Soviet compliance with 
arms treaties "to an extent that I don't think anyone had ever dreamed would 
have been possible," largely because of the U.S. military personnel allowed to 
make inspections in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with whom he has met five 
times since the Soviet leader assumed power in 1985, Reagan said: "Have I 
embraced him too quickly? What harm has been done? He's reduced his forces. We 
have the first treaty that the Soviets have ever signed in which they agreed to 
destroy weapons they already had." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also defended his Administration's efforts to free the nine Americans 
still held hostage in the Middle East, saying that rescue missions might have 
endangered their lives and that "we thought there was a better chance (to free 
the hostages) with all of the various things" the Administration tried. "I 
don't know what more we could have done," Reagan said, calling hostage-taking 
"one of the cruelest, most cowardly, barbaric things that any group of people 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the Americans' captivity "preys heavily on me," the President 
said: "I hope and pray, if it can't be us, that it can soon be the next 
Administration that will see them come home." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing immigrants, Reagan repeatedly called for compassion for refugees, 
saying that "we must do everything we can to offer humane treatment" to them. 
They "had a special love for freedom and a courage to uproot themselves, leave 
family and friends and come to this country to start a new life. And I still 
believe that this country should offer that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President said he wondered, however, " . . . do we come to a point in which 
we just plain can't handle them?" And he said: "I think not only should we 
welcome them, but I think there is an area where we should also collaborate 
with our allies and other democracies to make sure that everybody is doing 
their bit in this -- that maybe we're going to have to redirect refugees to 
other countries that are also willing to take them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Quota Set 
</P>
<P>
For the current fiscal year, the United States has set an overall refugee quota 
of 90,000, including 46,500 from Indochina. To qualify as a refugee, a person 
must show a "well-founded fear of persecution" in his home country. 
</P>
<P>
Several immigration experts asserted that this number is too low for a nation 
of the United States' size. 
</P>
<P>
For example, David S. North, director for the Center for Labor and Migration 
Studies, said that Canada plans to admit from 33,000 to 36,000 refugees this 
year. "For a country one-ninth our size, that is a tremendous number," he said. 
"I'm not terribly optimistic that much could come from Reagan's line of 
reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if other countries are doing nothing," said Rick Swartz, president 
of the National Forum on Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has said often that he will hit the "mashed potato circuit" after 
leaving office and returning to California, speaking out on conservative issues 
and in support of Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues will be congressional redistricting following the 1990 census, 
a contentious issue in California. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the 
state's 1980 redistricting plan, even though Republicans had argued that the 
Democratic-controlled state government had drawn the lines unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People 'Being Used' 
</P>
<P>
Noting the court decision, the President said: "I'm going to have to convince 
the people that they're being used by a political party for political 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Reagan noted that his acting experience proved valuable to him as 
President, saying it helped him tolerate severe criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Public portrayals and so forth were quite critical" of actors, he said. "That 
was one thing that's similar to what happens here." Reagan, one-time president 
of the Screen Actors Guild, said actors were unfairly portrayed as "just 
marrying and divorcing on a whole-scale manner," while the divorce rate for 
Hollywood actually was lower than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
The President also cited "an awful lot of critical reviews that I think were 
unjustified." 
</P>
<P>
"So . . . it didn't come as a shock to me," Reagan said, "to read columns or 
editorials, or hear criticism and this kind of thing; I've lived with that for 
more than a quarter of a century in Hollywood."

ROCKWELL AGREES TO CONDITIONAL GUILTY PLEAS ON OVERBILLING AF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International Corp. agreed Wednesday to enter conditional guilty pleas 
to two felony counts charging that the company conspired to defraud the Air 
Force by overbilling on contracts for the NAVSTAR satellite navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached on the eve of trial on the charges in Los Angeles 
federal court, leaves the company open to a fine well in excess of $500,000 and 
the possibility of suspension from future government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement also allows Rockwell to retain the right to withdraw its 
guilty pleas should the company prevail on appeal in its claim that it never 
should have been prosecuted for wrongdoing that its own company officials 
voluntarily disclosed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner said Wednesday that the Justice Department will 
seek a "very substantial fine" when the company is sentenced on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Underscore the Efforts' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary in order to underscore the efforts of the U.S. 
attorney's office and the Justice Department in the area of procurement fraud 
to the industry generally and, of course, hopefully to get the attention of the 
defense industry," Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing scheduled for 1:30 p.m. today, Rockwell is expected to plead 
guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government in connection 
with the NAVSTAR global positioning system and one count of criminal contempt. 
</P>
<P>
The contempt count stems from a 1982 court injunction prohibiting the company 
from submitting false claims to the government, an order issued in response to 
a government suit accusing the company of fraudulently shifting costs to the 
space shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the Department of Defense's voluntary disclosure program, a Reagan 
Administration effort to encourage contractors to report suspected fraud, 
Rockwell lawyers turned over evidence of the alleged double-billing, repaid the 
amount of the overbilling and fired one of the employees involved in the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall has already rejected the company's motion 
to dismiss the indictment on that basis, and Bonner predicted that Rockwell's 
appeal will be unsuccessful as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Department's voluntary disclosure program requires that a company 
make a full disclosure of its fraudulent activities before, and I underscore 
before, any government investigation or audit has started," Bonner said. "In 
this case, an investigation into possible mischarging and defective pricing 
with respect to the contract in question had started fully 10 months before 
Rockwell made any disclosure to the government." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Rockwell said Wednesday that the company has 
maintained it never should have been indicted and has also "consistently 
agreed" that the two employees who were also indicted in the case, Donald 
Carter, former material division director at the company's Satellite Systems 
Division in Downey and Seal Beach, and Robert Zavodnick, 46, former manager of 
major subcontracts for the division, "violated company policies and 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
"When the company discovered what had occurred, it conducted an intensive 
internal investigation, disciplined the employees involved, offered full 
restitution to the Air Force, and disclosed the results of its investigation to 
the government," the company's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Zavodnick, a Fountain Valley resident, pleaded guilty in September. Carter, 60, 
of Temecula was acquitted last month. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner denied that the acquittal prompted the government to accept a plea 
bargain in the case, noting that the company has agreed to plead guilty to the 
most serious charges in the indictment and faces a potentially unlimited fine 
on the contempt count. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said it agreed to the plea in order to proceed with the appeal on the 
voluntary disclosure issue and "to avoid a costly trial for both the company 
and the federal government."

PROP. 103 SUPPORTERS ASK LIMITS BE SET ON AUTO POLICY CANCELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Proposition 103 "Voter Revolt" organization and a coalition of consumer and 
civil rights groups filed an administrative petition with the state Department 
of Insurance on Wednesday proposing a specific set of regulations to limit 
insurance company rights to cancel or refuse to renew auto insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners complained that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has 
"failed to act decisively" to promulgate rules fleshing out and applying the 
portions of Proposition 103 that the state Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 7 could 
go into effect pending the court's review of the measure's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups filing the petition were the Consumers Union, the Center for 
Public Interest Law, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the South-Central Organizing 
Committee, the Latino Issues Forum and the Congress of California Seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the petition procedure, the department has 30 days to either accept the 
regulations the groups propose, deny them or call a public hearing on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed at the Insurance Department offices in Los Angeles. In 
San Francisco, a spokeswoman for Gillespie said the commissioner had not yet 
seen it and would reserve comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gillespie, under pressure from a large association of insurance agents 
to issue regulations on how to apply portions of Proposition 103, said earlier 
this month that she would not do so until the Supreme Court rules on the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulations on cancellations and non-renewals filed by the 
pro-Proposition 103 groups Wednesday follow the filing of another petition last 
week by many of the same groups. That petition proposed procedures for 
exempting companies from the rate rollbacks called for by Proposition 103, if 
the Supreme Court upholds the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, a company may be exempted from the prescribed 20% rollbacks 
from 1987 levels if it can show the insurance commissioner that it would face a 
substantial threat of insolvency if it made such cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Proposition 103 groups are proposing that "urgency status" be given 
company petitions for exemptions, that hearings to be conducted by an 
administrative law judge be scheduled within 14 days and that the insurance 
commissioner make a determination within three days of receiving a proposed 
decision from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
A key recommendation by the pro-103 groups involves standards for determining 
when there is "a substantial increase in the hazard insured against" that, 
under Proposition 103, would allow the companies to refuse to renew a policy. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-103 groups advanced a regulation saying that such an increase in hazard 
exists for any person whose driving record shows a violation count, according 
to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, of more than three points within 24 
months, more than four points within 36 months or more than five points within 
60 months. Most speeding convictions count for a point, while negligent or 
drunk-driving convictions count for two points. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there would be a recognized substantial increase in hazard if a 
driver was involved in three or more accidents resulting either in injury or 
property damage of $200 or more within a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, the Insurance Department officially barred 
the Fireman's Fund group of companies from conditionally renewing auto 
insurance policies, a practice the companies implemented after Proposition 103 
passed. The seven Fireman's Fund companies have been telling customers their 
policies will not be renewed unless they agree to give the companies the right 
to later cancel coverage.

UNIONS BARRED FROM FIRING DISSENTING LOCAL LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major decision regarding the free speech rights of union members, the 
Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that labor unions may not fire elected local 
officials who disagree with policies of the parent union. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-0 decision, written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said that firing an 
elected official because he opposed a dues increase violated the 1959 
Landrum-Griffin Act. The act, he wrote, is designed "to ensure that unions are 
democratically governed and responsive to the will of the union membership as 
expressed in open, periodic elections." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said that permitting an official to be fired for expressing dissenting 
opinions would lead union members to conclude "that one challenged the union 
hierarchy, if at all, at one's peril. That is precisely what Congress sought to 
prevent when it passed" the 1959 law. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision affirmed a 1986 ruling of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The AFL-CIO was sufficiently concerned about the case that it filed a 
brief on behalf of the Sheet Metal Workers International Assn., the union 
directly involved in the case. The AFL-CIO feared that an adverse ruling would 
restrict national unions' abilities to operate as freely as they choose. 
Lawyers for the AFL-CIO and the Sheet Metal Workers International did not 
return calls asking for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Benson, president of the nonprofit Assn. for Union Democracy, called the 
decision "extremely important." He said that ever since a 1982 decision of the 
high court upholding the rights of a newly elected local union president to 
fire officials appointed by his predecessor, the job security of elected 
officials had also been in question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1982 Dispute Over Dues 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision arose out of a 1982 dispute in a Los Angeles local of the 
Sheet Metal Workers International over whether to impose a dues increase to 
help remedy the local's financial problems. Edward Lynn, an elected business 
agent of the local, opposed the dues increase. He and other members of Local 75 
asserted that officials of their local were paid considerably more than 
officials of comparable locals and contended that a salary reduction for them, 
rather than a dues increase, was the appropriate solution to the union's 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after the dues increase was voted down at a union meeting, Richard 
Hawkins, a trustee appointed by the Sheet Metal Workers International who 
favored the increase, told Lynn that he was being removed "indefinitely" from 
his position as business agent because of his outspoken opposition to the dues 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
After exhausting his intra-union remedies, Lynn sued the union in federal 
District Court in Los Angeles in 1983. The District Court granted a summary 
judgment for the union, citing Finnegan vs. Leu, the 1982 decision that gave 
unions broad rights in firing appointed officials. Lynn appealed to the 9th 
Circuit and prevailed. Since there was a conflict among federal circuit courts 
on the issue, the Supreme Court took the case. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision means that Lynn, now working as a sheet metal worker for 
Los Angeles County, can now sue the union for wrongful discharge and damages. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, 54, said he was "happy for the rest of the union members in this 
country." However, he said, he had to endure 18 months without work after the 
dues dispute because union officials refused to send him out on jobs. He still 
has a complaint pending at the National Labor Relations Board on allegations 
that the union illegally failed to dispatch him to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine getting a decision from the Supreme Court before the NLRB 
acts?" he asked. "Slow justice is no justice." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn's lawyers said they were elated at the decision. Both Bruce Stark, a Los 
Angeles attorney who handled the case in the lower federal courts, and Paul 
Levy of the Public Citizen Litigation group in Washington, who argued the case 
before the Supreme Court, called the ruling "a great victory for union 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Levy added: "If union leaders could deprive their opponents of elected office, 
no member would feel safe in speaking out about union affairs, and dissent 
would be silenced." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall referred to the purposes of the 1959 law, whose first section is 
called a "Bill of Rights" for union members, in distinguishing the Lynn case 
from the 1982 Finnegan case. He said the goal of that section of the 1959 law 
was to ensure democratic union governance. Marshall said that allowing a newly 
elected local president to fire officials appointed by his predecessor did not 
frustrate that objective. "Rather, it ensured a union's 'responsiveness to the 
mandate of the union election,' " he said. He said the facts of the Lynn case 
presented just the opposite situation.

TEXAS SITE IS OFFICIAL CHOICE FOR COLLIDER

<P>
The Energy Department on Wednesday officially crowned Texas the winner of a 
multi-state battle to host a proposed $5.9-billion superconducting super 
collider. 
</P>
<P>
At a formal ceremony attended by Texas Gov. Bill Clements, John S. Herrington, 
the energy secretary, signed an official "record of decision" to build the 
massive physics installation around the city of Waxahachie, about 25 miles 
south of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
California had been initially considered a leading contender for the collider, 
but was not a finalist. It had been eliminated due to concern about the 
geological stability of sites promoted by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that would use 10,000 
magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at energy levels 20 times 
what is possible in today's machines. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists will use the facility to explore the nature of matter and energy. It 
is to be called the Ronald Reagan Center for High-Energy Physics, although it 
remains uncertain whether Congress will give the go-ahead to begin 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the collider, but it 
decreed that none of the money be spent on construction. In his budget proposal 
for the coming fiscal year, President Reagan requested $250 million for the 
collider, including $90 million for research and development and $160 million 
for construction. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington had declared last Nov. 10 that Texas was the "preferred site" for 
the project, but a waiting period was required before the choice was made 
official.

NEW LAW IN ESTONIA REQUIRES RUSSIANS THERE TO LEARN NATIVE LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unprecedented move to protect its national culture against Russian 
domination, the Estonian Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a 
controversial language law that will require most of the 40% Russian minority 
living there to learn the native language. 
</P>
<P>
While others among the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics state in their 
constitutions that theirs is the official language, the Estonian law is the 
first that goes beyond a symbolic declaration to spell out when and by whom the 
national language must be used. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure is milder than an earlier draft favored by the most militantly 
nationalistic Estonians, but it nevertheless faces attempts by its ethnic 
Russian opponents to appeal to Moscow for relief. The Kremlin's attitude toward 
the new law was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
Estonians are already required to learn Russian, even though many choose not to 
speak it. But tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who have migrated to Estonia 
since it was forcibly annexed in 1940 do not speak Estonian, a Finno-Ugric 
language that is more related to Hungarian or Finnish than to Russian. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which was supported by the republic's Communist Party leadership, 
effectively requires factory managers, sales clerks, police and anyone else 
dealing with the Estonian-speaking public to learn Estonian within four years. 
Most party and government officials would have to become bilingual within two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The law also requires that the wording on stamps, signs, proclamations, reports 
and advertisements intended for the general public be in Estonian. The wording 
may also appear in Russian, but not in larger letters. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote in favor of the bill -- Estonian television journalist Andres 
Raid said it followed a nine-hour, paragraph-by-paragraph debate -- was 204 to 
50, with 6 abstentions. Ethnic Estonians make up about two-thirds of the 
republic's Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, and ethnic Russians make up the rest. 
Most of the Russians voted against the proposal, Raid said by telephone from 
Tallinn, Estonia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny Soviet minority numbering only about 1 million people, the Estonians 
have been in the forefront of national groups here moving to assert a greater 
degree of independence from Moscow. While some militants envision a complete 
separation from the Soviet Union, more say that realistically they can hope for 
no more than greater autonomy within the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier challenge to Moscow's authority, the Estonian Parliament in 
November voted itself the right to override Soviet laws. Moscow declared the 
move unconstitutional, only to have the Estonian Parliament reaffirm the 
declaration the following month, in slightly less confrontational terms.

SOVIET MAGAZINE CALLED 'KIND OF SCUM'; 
</P>
<P>
PRAVDA ARTICLE ATTACKS PRO-GORBACHEV EDITOR

<P>
A long-simmering controversy surrounding an editor at the forefront of 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost policy took an ominous turn Wednesday 
when the Communist Party newspaper Pravda published a sharp attack on the 
editor by an influential group of conservative writers. 
</P>
<P>
Such cultural battles have extraordinary political significance in countries 
like the Soviet Union, where rulers still rely more on ideology than on a 
public mandate for their legitimacy. And while the top Soviet political leaders 
have carefully steered clear of this fracas, publication of an open letter in 
the country's most important newspaper appears to have increased the pressure 
for them to weigh in on one side or the other. 
</P>
<P>
While the letter did not name its target, it was clearly aimed at Vitaly A. 
Korotich, a Ukrainian poet who nearly three years ago took over as editor of a 
nondescript magazine called Ogonyok (Little Flame) and turned it into a leading 
force for liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Distort History' 
</P>
<P>
But to the six writers and a like-minded film director who wrote the letter to 
Pravda, Ogonyok represents "a kind of scum . . . on the crest of the powerful 
wave of rejuvenation." The group accused the weekly of printing unsubstantiated 
articles that "distort history on an unprecedented scale . . . reassess 
people's social achievements and vulgarize cultural values." 
</P>
<P>
The letter writers, all of whom are considered key cultural conservatives, 
complained that "the magazine has assumed the role of an ultimate authority in 
all spheres of public life, politics, economics, culture and morals." And in 
perhaps their most serious accusation, they added, "These activities have a 
precisely formulated goal: to humiliate, to slander, to discredit." 
</P>
<P>
Among the letter's signatories are the Siberian writer Valentin Rasputin and 
Sergei Bondarchuk, a film director probably best known for his "War and Peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Opposed 
</P>
<P>
While they were not signatories, other key cultural conservatives said to be 
trying to force Korotich out of his post are Sergei Mikhailkov, head of the 
Russian Writers Union; Yuri Bondarev, a politically powerful novelist and 
Mikhailkov's deputy, and Anatoly Ivanov, editor of the rightist literary 
magazine Molodaya Gvardia (Young Guard). 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, members of the anti-Semitic, right-wing group called Pamyat 
violently disrupted a meeting being held to nominate Korotich for a seat in the 
next Soviet legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Korotich, you Jew, give back your silver coins," the Pamyat members shouted. 
Korotich is not Jewish, but Russian anti-Semites frequently use the term 
referring to anyone considered liberal or "cosmopolitan." 
</P>
<P>
The Pravda attack was in direct response to an open letter published in 
Ogonyok's first edition of 1989, in which the then-chief editor of 
Literaturnaya Rossiya (Russian Literature), the official publication of the 
Russian Writers Union, accused his superior, Bondarev, of working against 
Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or the "restructuring" of Soviet society. 
"You need the paper as your own mouthpiece, promoting your -- let's put it 
mildly -- not very progressive ideas, which would protect you and your group 
from criticism and which would expose and soil your enemies," wrote journalist 
Mikhail Kolosov. 
</P>
<P>
By the next issue of Literaturnaya Rossiya, the 65-year-old Kolosov's name had 
disappeared from the masthead. And in response to a query from The Times on 
Wednesday, a spokesman for the publication said he "has been retired." 
</P>
<P>
"Haven't we lost our dignity and public conscience if we can permit such 
humiliation and dishonor of the famous artist without any cause?" the Pravda 
letter asked rhetorically about the attack on Bondarev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Perestroika 
</P>
<P>
Bondarev has been publicly critical of Gorbachev's policies, most notably 
during last summer's party conference here, when he compared perestroika to an 
airplane that had taken off without any clear destination. 
</P>
<P>
Korotich, who is said to be abroad and unavailable for comment Wednesday, is 
considered one of Gorbachev's closest allies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Soviet leader has apparently been trying to stay out of the cultural 
fray while he deals with a potentially even more serious backlash among 
ordinary Soviet citizens who have so far seen mostly empty store shelves in the 
wake of his "restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
When Korotich was attacked last week at a meeting attended by a group of 
leading Soviet intellectuals, Gorbachev at one point reportedly said, "Why 
don't our writers adopt the principle of unilateral disarmament?" 
</P>
<P>
But the Pravda letter appears to represent instead a new phase of the cultural 
arms race.

KOHL ASSAILED IN PARLIAMENT OVER LIBYAN PLANT 
</P>

<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's policies in the matter of the Libyan chemical plant 
have deceived the West German public and severely damaged relations between 
West Germany and the United States, an opposition political leader charged 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Norbert Gansel, an armaments expert of the Social Democratic Party, said during 
a two-hour debate in the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament, that Kohl 
had encouraged "the business of death." 
</P>
<P>
He said Kohl and spokesmen for his government were "still not able to 
understand the political dimensions" of the Libyan affair. 
</P>
<P>
The Kohl government refused, Gansel said, to accept warnings from U.S. 
intelligence services that West German firms were helping to build a plant at 
Rabta, about 40 miles southwest of Tripoli, the Libyan capital. U.S. officials 
say the plant was designed to produce chemical weapons; Libya insists it was 
intended to make pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
Gansel accused Kohl of being arrogant and of damaging Bonn's international 
reputation by allowing the world to assume that West Germany is tolerant of its 
companies' aid in setting up poison gas factories. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, he said, has not measured up to West Germany's special moral 
responsibility stemming from Germany's Nazi past. In the Nazi period, from 1933 
to 1945, poison gas was used to kill millions of Jews and others in death 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
Gansel said that Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, with chemical weapons supplied 
in part by West Germany, could endanger the existence of Israel, and he added: 
</P>
<P>
"The Jews will not forget, the Americans have not forgotten and the Germans are 
not allowed to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"German-American relations have never been so severely burdened as today," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's debate in the Bundestag was opened by Wolfgang Schaeuble, chief of 
Kohl's chancellery, who admitted that as early as August, 1987, the West German 
government had received intelligence reports indicating that West German firms 
were involved with the Libyan plant. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaeuble, echoing previous statements by Kohl, said the intelligence was 
not hard enough to initiate formal proceedings against the companies in light 
of West Germany's lax export rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The West German government and West German authorities must abide by German 
law and nothing else," Schaeuble told a chamber that was only half full. 
"Businessmen are also citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Gansel replied that West Germany should restrain the sale of sensitive 
materials, and he accused Kohl of implicitly pushing the export of West German 
armaments. 
</P>
<P>
"Distinctions must be drawn between foreign trade and the business with death," 
he said, as Kohl sat stolidly on the front bench listening to the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"You, Chancellor Kohl, are politically and personally responsible that the 
world and the West German public were not informed," Gansel said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kohl's government announced that it would tighten export sales of 
arms and materials that might be used by chemical weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expertise for Plant 
</P>
<P>
West German firms have also been accused of helping provide materials and 
expertise for a chemical weapons plant that Iraq is said to have built near 
Samarra. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. officials first let it be known that they had hard evidence linking 
West German companies to the Libyan plant, Kohl and his spokesmen reacted 
angrily. The chancellor reportedly passed a message to Washington through 
retiring U.S. Ambassador Richard R. Burt that he was fed up with the United 
States' treating West Germany like "a banana republic." 
</P>
<P>
But as the days passed, the Kohl government was forced to admit that West 
German companies were indeed involved and that the controversy was not simply 
something dreamed up, as Kohl suggested, by opponents in order to embarrass 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, citing what he called 
"German help to radical Arabs to build weapons to kill Jews," complained 
Wednesday to the West German ambassador about the reported sale of materials to 
the Libyan plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Minister Arens called the ambassador to express Israel's deep concern and to 
protest about the assistance given by German factories to build a chemical 
warfare infrastructure in Libya," Arens' spokesman, Mordechai Amihai, said. 
</P>
<P>
Arens also asked the ambassador, Wilhelm Haas, and his government to help 
verify if German companies were involved in providing similar help to Iraq and 
Syria, Amihai said. He declined to give more specifics on the possible German 
involvement in those two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Haas told reporters later that West Germany "would do everything in its power 
to prevent German firms or individuals from assisting foreign countries in 
acquiring chemical warfare capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a state prosecutor in Frankfurt announced Wednesday that legal 
proceedings have been undertaken against IBI Engineering, a firm run by 
Iraqi-born, London-based Ihsan Barbouti, who reportedly coordinated the sale of 
millions of dollars worth of materials to the Rabta plant. 
</P>
<P>
Similar proceedings were started last week against Imhausen-Chemie, a chemical 
company based in Lahr, in the Rhine Valley at the edge of the Black Forest. 
</P>
<P>
And in Munich, prosecutors said Wednesday that they have begun a criminal 
investigation of a Bavarian firm that the news magazine Der Spiegel says helped 
Libya develop the ability for in-flight refueling of warplanes. Munich 
Prosecutor Heinz Stocker said the Intec Technical Trade Logistic Co. was 
suspected of violating export laws, but he did not elaborate on the equipment 
involved or what uses it had been put to in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
19 Tons of Solvent 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether investigators were also looking into a 
report by Der Spiegel that Intec engineers had helped refit Libyan warplanes 
for mid-flight refueling. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, other German firms have been coming forward to authorities with 
details of their dealings with Libya or with firms suspected of dealing with 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The Merck chemical company said it shipped 19 tons of a chemical solvent to 
Libya last year, and it said the destination may have been the Rabta plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Alfred Teves company of Frankfurt said it supplied $2.8-million worth of 
ventilation equipment to IBI in 1986. A spokesman said Teves believed at the 
time that the material was to be used for a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong. 
The West German news magazine Stern says the Hong Kong plant was built to 
disguise West German involvement in the Libyan facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Rhenus transport company in Cologne said federal officials seized some of 
its records in conjunction with the growing Libyan investigation. A spokesman 
for Rhenus said the firm entered into contracts with IBI in 1986, 1987 and 1988 
to deliver construction materials and chemicals to Libya.

U.S. DETAILS LIBYA'S INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM

<P>
In an attempt to maintain international pressure on the regime of Col. Moammar 
Kadafi and expand concern over its new chemical weapons plant, the United 
States on Wednesday issued its most detailed account to date of Libyan 
involvement in international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department statement accused the Kadafi regime of being "implacably 
committed to ending U.S. and other Western influence in the Third World . . . 
and to destroying the state of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
"Despite a public posture of moderation" recently, the report by the 
Counterterrorism Office said, "Libya has employed threats, terrorism and 
military aggression" on five continents. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department accused Kadafi of propounding a deliberately two-faced 
policy. "To recoup lost influence, Libya has undertaken a concerted diplomatic 
campaign to improve relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, with 
its Arab neighbors and with key African states." At the same time, it has 
preserved "its traditional contacts with dissident, subversive and terrorist 
groups in such countries." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said that the release of the position paper "is not 
related to the Pan Am bombing or the shootdown of the MIGs or the Libyan 
chemical warfare plant." 
</P>
<P>
But other U.S. sources said the timing indicates that the Reagan Administration 
wants to ensure that foreign action on Libya's plant, which the Administration 
says is to produce chemical weapons, does not dilute the attention paid to 
Kadafi's other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites Libyan involvement in four assassination plots against Arab 
and African presidents in Egypt, Sudan, Zaire and Chad, all of whom are close 
allies of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the position paper charges, Libya has sought to improve its image 
and to expand its influence "by using the promise of economic and commercial 
benefit -- principally in the petroleum sector -- as political leverage." 
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, Kadafi has continued to aid groups such as the 
Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army. A shipment of surface-to-air 
missiles bound for the Irish nationalist group was uncovered by French 
authorities just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade Palestinian group led by Abu Nidal, who is based in Libya, also 
has resumed terrorist acts in Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific and Asia, Kadafi has sought to expand his influence at the 
expense of the West "by sponsoring radical individuals and groups whose 
activities exacerbate local problems," the report said. Tripoli has provided 
funding and training to groups in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan 
and New Caledonia, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, the counterterrorism document traces Libyan support to 
insurgents and terrorists as far back as 1973. "Several Latin groups Libya 
supports are prime suspects in recent strikes against U.S. targets," the report 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
The position paper also suggested that Libya "may have been involved in 
possible acts of subversion" in the United States over the last 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest case involved five members of the El Rukns street gang in Chicago 
who were convicted in late 1987 of planning terrorist activities. U.S. 
prosecutors charged that the gang expected to receive $2.5 million from Libya 
for assassination attempts on American politicians and for attacks on U.S. 
aircraft and government facilities.

SHERIFF PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN STING CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham, the first elected official indicted in a 
three-year political corruption investigation, pleaded not guilty in federal 
court Wednesday to charges that he offered to "manufacture" crime statistics in 
exchange for $3,650 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
After his release without bail, the veteran lawman told reporters that he is 
innocent and has no intention of resigning from the post he was first elected 
to in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that I'd like to have my day in court, and that's what I 
intend to do," said the grim-faced Graham. "It's a situation that I never 
dreamed of when I started out in law enforcement 25 years ago. It's certainly 
not fun." 
</P>
<P>
Accused of using his office to extort campaign contributions from the developer 
of a $600-million marina and condominium project on the Sacramento River, 
Graham faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in federal prison and a fine of $1 
million or more if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Graham grew out of an elaborate federal sting operation in 
which FBI agents posing as businessmen paid out campaign contributions and 
honorariums to legislators while seeking support for special-interest bills to 
help them build a shrimp-processing plant in West Sacramento. The Graham case 
was an indirect spinoff of the Legislature probe. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the Capitol has been indicted, but sources close to the investigation 
say that several legislators and legislative aides are likely to be charged 
with violating federal anti-extortion laws. The timing, however, is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
In the Yolo County case, court documents say that Graham and his former 
undersheriff, Wendell Luttrull, approached developer Marvin Levin for financial 
help in Graham's contested 1986 reelection campaign. Levin is a partner in 
Lighthouse Marina and a former lobbyist who was secretly working with the FBI 
to set up the Capitol sting. 
</P>
<P>
Luttrull, who pleaded guilty to federal extortion charges last month, has said 
that he and Graham promised to aid the marina project in return for campaign 
contributions -- $2,000 in cash and a check for $1,650 drawn on the account of 
Gulf Shrimp Fisheries, one of the bogus companies set up by the FBI for the 
Capitol sting.

THE STOCKTON SCHOOL YARD MASSACRE;

SOMBER STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WRESTLE WITH THE HORROR

In single file, hushed, somber and each clasping a solitary pink tulip, a 
teacher and her 12 young students emerged from the front entrance of Cleveland 
Elementary School shortly after noon Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
They moved slowly toward a concrete block-lettered school sign obscured by 
stalks of mums, roses and gladioli. One by one, the ashen-faced children laid 
their flowers at the foot of the sign. Standing in a semicircle, they clasped 
hands, bowed their heads for a moment and then, without a word, retreated back 
inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brief moment in a day of remembrance and healing at Cleveland 
Elementary School, an improvised silent ceremony in honor of five classmates 
slain the day before in a random spray of gunfire. All day Wednesday, inside 
the classrooms of the beige stucco buildingand outside on a crowded parking 
lot, students, parents, teachers, and counselors wrestled with the horror they 
had witnessed and the memories that would not be easily erased. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a plain scary situation," acknowledged Dr. Mary Gonzales Mend, 
superintendent of the Stockton Unified School District. "We all need the 
opportunity to talk with others and get these feelings out." 
</P>
<P>
School custodians had worked overtime until midnight Tuesday, scrubbing away 
the blood and patching dozens of bullet holes that riddled the school walls. 
</P>
<P>
Outside one classroom, Room 17, more than 29 holes were patched. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Bryan Taylor, 6, cowered in a classroom and heard the staccato 
bursts of the assault rifle fired by Patrick Edward Purdy. He had seen 
classmates gunned down in the playground. His brother, Eric, 8, was wounded by 
the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours after the shooting, the boys' parents, Richard and Janet Taylor, 
took turns visiting Eric at Lodi Memorial Hospital and tending to Bryan at 
home. At first, Bryan asked his father, a California Highway Patrol officer, if 
he could wear a bulletproof vest to school. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Wednesday morning, Janet Taylor told a reporter, Bryan said he wanted 
to stay home. "I don't want to come back," he said. "I don't want to ever come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
With coaxing, Bryan finally agreed to go. But he was one of only 227 of the 
school's 963 students who showed up for class Wednesday. Many, like Bryan, 
clung to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Brando Villapuda, 6, cried when he realized that he was about to be separated 
from his father, Bernardo. "Daddy, I don't want to go," the child whimpered. "I 
don't want to go. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Counselors and teachers spent the first hour of class trying to gently persuade 
reluctant students to come inside. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some children who cried. There were some staff who cried," said 
Principal Pat Buscher. She said they would all "need time to work it through 
and deal with their grief, and go on and live wonderful, meaningful lives." 
</P>
<P>
Sodram Chan, a 6-year-old Cambodian pupil with a tear-stained face, held 
tightly to her mother, Taamao, until a counselor knelt by her side and said: 
"Sodram, your teacher is looking for you. She really wants to see you." 
</P>
<P>
When Juanita Leitch, who has taught at Cleveland for 12 years, showed up at the 
start of the day, she was uncertain what she would tell her pupils. "I will 
just wait," she said. "I will say, 'Good morning.' I want to see their 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Class started with seven pupils. At one point, Leitch asked them to draw what 
most tormented them. One child, who had seen his classmates scramble in terror 
the day before, drew stick figures of a boy leaning and another lying on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The child wrote a sentence to go with the drawing: "This is my friend," he 
wrote. "He was ready to fall. The other was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Connie Sass, 31, a Stockton resident whose young cousin, David Bryant, 6, was 
wounded Tuesday, came to the school in clown costume. She was among dozens of 
well-wishers who showed up to offer assistance, prayers, flowers and even poems 
for the children. 
</P>
<P>
School officials allowed Sass to visit the children during their lunch hour in 
the cafeteria. She walked from table to table, giving pep talks and singing 
songs requested by the pupils. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the school, visitors draped flowers and left stuffed animals on the 
"Cleveland School" sign. Marvilene Hagopian, a Sacramento resident, dropped off 
her own children at school in that city Wednesday morning and then drove to 
Stockton to leave her only offering, a one-page poem. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, Hagopian left her memento at the school sign, taped to the 
concrete letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help is out there," she had written. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, if you need help, get it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can give help, give it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never let this happen again."

CONTRACT TALK RUMORS TRIGGER STUDENT PROTEST 
</P>

<P>
More than 200 Fremont High School students walked out of classes Wednesday and 
staged a noisy, impromptu protest in front of the South Los Angeles campus 
after rumors spread that teachers would withhold semester grades next month as 
part of their contract fight with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour demonstration began about 9 a.m. when students poured out onto 
San Pedro Street in front of the school waving signs and chanting, "We want our 
grades." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rock-Throwing, Shoving 
</P>
<P>
The protest grew tense at times because of rock-throwing and shoving incidents. 
A large contingent of Los Angeles police cordoned off a four-block stretch of 
San Pedro Street and stood across the street from the school. No injuries were 
reported, but one 17-year-old student was arrested for allegedly tossing a rock 
and a police officer was hit with an egg. 
</P>
<P>
Top school district officials, including school board President Roberta 
Weintraub, arrived and offered students a written guarantee that they will 
receive their grades and graduate on schedule. Most hooted at the offer until 
Shirley Garrett, an activist parent with Fremont's Booster Club, waded into the 
boisterous crowd and took command of the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're behind you all the way," Garrett told the students, and they erupted in 
cheers. "But in the name of Jesus, go back. . . . I don't want (any trouble) 
with those officers standing there." 
</P>
<P>
The outburst was the most visible sign yet of the growing frustration of 
students and parents who believe they are caught in the middle of a drawn-out 
contract fight between Los Angeles Unified School District management and the 
teachers union. Although both sides have reported progress in recent weeks, 
disputes over a number of key issues block a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boycotting Duties 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to pressure the district to meet its demands, teachers have been 
boycotting some duties. They have stopped filing student progress reports with 
school offices, for example, although students have been able to obtain reports 
directly from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials have said there is a possibility that grades for the fall 
semester, which are due Feb. 3, may not be filed with the district if a new 
contract is not signed by then. Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los 
Angeles, said late Wednesday, however, that if teachers withhold grades, it 
will be done in a way that will not harm students. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials say withholding semester grades would be a 
significant escalation of the dispute because it would interfere with 
preparation of student transcripts needed by graduating seniors to apply for 
college. That was clearly one of the concerns that sparked Wednesday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair. I've worked hard for my grades," said Lynette Patton, a senior. 
"I want them." 
</P>
<P>
"We are the ones on the spot," Ramon Perez, a senior who needs the grades to 
complete his application to a state university, told district officials at a 
hastily arranged negotiating session in the principal's office. "We're in the 
middle between you, teachers and the contract. Who's getting affected?" 
</P>
<P>
Perez said later that he supports teachers' efforts to get pay raises but that 
other students are highly critical of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Escalation 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the contract fight appeared concerned late Wednesday about the 
risk of greater problems -- and potential public outcries -- should the dispute 
escalate and protests spread to other campuses. Associate Supt. Gabe Cortina 
said Weintraub and Supt. Leonard Britton will make direct contact with teacher 
union leaders to try to avert an escalation. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have expressed concern in recent weeks about the effect of the boycott 
on their children. Last week, a group of Latino parents demonstrated outside 
the teachers union headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
There have been tentative signs of progress recently in the negotiations, 
however, and both Johnson and Weintraub expressed hope Wednesday that a 
settlement could be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest issue remains money. The district is offering a 17% increase over 
three years, with the possibility of more if additional state funds are made 
available. The teachers want a one-year agreement with a 12% pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to win public support has been fierce on both sides, with teachers 
attacking allegedly overpaid central office executives in newspaper, radio and 
RTD bus ads. Union officials contend that at least $200 million in surplus 
funds that could be used to pay teachers has been concealed in various spots in 
the district's $3.5-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Hearings 
</P>
<P>
The school board, claiming it cannot even afford the offer it has already made, 
will step up its counterattack next week when it begins a series of hearings on 
possible massive budget cuts. Figures have not been released, but the proposed 
cuts are expected to total more than $50 million and to affect a variety of 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
After pay, the second biggest issue is a power struggle over how neighborhood 
schools should be governed. The district and the union both want to move to a 
so-called school-based management system that gives local principals, teachers 
and parents far greater say in how their schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the Los Angeles administrators' groups want principals to 
retain a veto over local decisions. Teachers oppose the principals' veto and 
seek a majority of voting positions on the proposed local school councils that 
would make budget and curriculum decisions and eventually personnel decisions 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side is proposing to give parents a controlling voice in the school 
councils, and school board members are beginning to feel pressure from parents 
who wanted more power in the decision making. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers also are demanding paid preparation time for elementary 
schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
Another key issue is repayment of millions of dollars in wages the district has 
docked from teachers who have participated in the boycott. Johnson has vowed 
that teachers will not settle unless every penny in docked pay is given to 
teachers. The district has said there is no basis for paying teachers for work 
not performed.

ARCHDIOCESE TO OFFER HELP IN OVERCOMING POST-ABORTION GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disputing the U.S. surgeon general's view that conclusive evidence is lacking 
for post-abortion syndrome, Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony announced the 
formation Wednesday of a Los Angeles archdiocese project to counsel women, 
especially Catholics, said to be suffering emotional stress after an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony estimated that as many as 45,000 Catholics are among the 113,000 women 
reported to have abortions each year within the Los Angeles archdiocese, which 
covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I have women come to me who have had abortions 10, 15 years ago who say 
something is very wrong," the archbishop added. "Guilt is the seed, because 
they know they have taken a life," he said, referring to the Catholic tenet 
that human life begins at conception. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been amazed at the number of Hispanic women, most of whom are Catholic," 
who have had abortions, Mahony said in response to a question at his news 
conference. "Many never have heard or been told that it is against church 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony took issue with U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who said on Jan. 9 
that "Scientific studies do not provide conclusive data about the health 
effects of abortion on women." In declining to write a long-awaited study, Koop 
told President Reagan that almost 250 studies "do not support the premise that 
abortion does or does not cause or contribute to psychological problems." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Mahony contended that research shows that 90% of women experience 
moderate to severe emotional stress after abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony indicated that the knowledge that the church prohibits abortion can 
cause anguish for Catholic women who voluntarily end their pregnancies. "For 
Catholics, the pain of abortion is intensified by a sense of alienation from 
God and church, and the majority of Catholic women who have had abortions do 
not return either to the sacraments or to the church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Reconciliation 
</P>
<P>
Project Rachel, patterned after programs in other Catholic dioceses, seeks to 
reconcile remorseful women with the church after "reviving and refashioning 
their vision of right and wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, around the Jan. 23 anniversary of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling permitting abortions, Catholic and conservative Protestant leaders issue 
renewed statements of condemnation and often take part in anti-abortion 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said in an interview that this year he was limiting his "focus" to a 
special Mass Sunday night at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Pasadena where 100 
priests, sisters, deacons, counselors and lay people will be commissioned as 
Project Rachel volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
He has expressed "prayerful support" for a Southern California Pastors' Rescue 
rally to be held Saturday evening at St. Pancratius Catholic Church in 
Lakewood, he said. But it is "not something that I or any of the other bishops 
(in Los Angeles) will be involved in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstration Planned 
</P>
<P>
Father Al Howard, a rally spokesman and director of a Long Beach home for unwed 
mothers, said the group on Feb. 12 will conduct the first large demonstration 
in Southern California attempting to block the entrance to one or more abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The pastors' group is unaffiliated with the nationwide Operation Rescue in 
which thousands of protesters were arrested during 1988 for blocking abortion 
clinic entrances, Howard said. About 650 Operation Rescue demonstrators were 
arrested Jan. 14 in New York City, and the next day Cardinal John O'Connor 
likened the protest to the nonviolent civil rights movement of the late Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in the Los Angeles archdiocese program is on "a loving, forgiving 
church," a brochure says. Although it does not play down the moral gravity of 
abortion, Roman Catholic canon law, revised four years ago, does not regard 
those who have participated in abortion as excommunicated.

BRITON ACCUSED OF KILLING NORTHRIDGE FAMILY TO BE TRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One-time Reseda auto dealer Harvey Rader on Wednesday was ordered to stand 
trial in the murder of four members of a Northridge family in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge David M. Horwitz concluded a weeklong preliminary 
hearing by finding that there was probable cause to believe that Rader had 
committed the crimes. He ordered that Rader, 47, be held without bail pending 
arraignment in Superior Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rader is accused of murdering Sol Salomon, an Israeli immigrant who had his own 
business refilling fire extinguishers and told friends he had invested in 
Rader's car business; Salomon's wife, Elaine; and their two children, Michalle, 
15, and Mitchell, 9. Their bodies have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, a British subject, was arrested last summer as he completed a federal 
prison term for passport fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lonnie Felker, who has characterized the murder cases 
against Rader as somewhat weak, said he was pleased by Horwitz's ruling, but 
noted, "This is only the first step in a long process. . . . Obviously the 
burden of proof at a preliminary hearing is a lot less than at a trial. We're 
looking forward to doing our best to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt 
at trial." 
</P>
<P>
Felker said the district attorney's office will decide soon whether to seek the 
death penalty in the case, which is built on circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Rader's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mark Lessem, said he is "confident my 
client will be acquitted." He said there is no evidence that Rader committed 
the murders and "whether or not there's a murder at all is also questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Rader has been the prime suspect in the case for many years, Lessem 
said his client looked forward to resolving the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"This has ruined his life," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lessem said he had intended to prove at the preliminary hearing that police 
attempted to strengthen their case by arranging a fabricated confession. He 
alleged that police had Rader placed in jail with known informants for that 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informant Won't Testify 
</P>
<P>
But one of the informants Lessem intended to call as a witness to try to prove 
his claim was advised by his own attorney not to testify for fear of 
incriminating himself. A second informant said he will not testify unless 
Horwitz ordered police to protect him. Horwitz declined, and Lessem abandoned 
his attempt to prove police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Rader was first arrested in the case in 1983 along with his cousin, Ashley 
Paulle, after Paulle made a series of statements to authorities accusing Rader 
of the murders and implicating himself as Rader's aide. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office did not charge Rader at that time, saying there 
was insufficient evidence. The case against Paulle was dismissed because it was 
found that the district attorney's office had improperly revoked his immunity.

JURY STRUGGLING IN BOMBING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles federal court jury deliberating in the trial of two people 
accused in the 1980 bombing death of a Manhattan Beach woman said Wednesday 
that it was unable to reach a verdict, but the judge told the panel to continue 
its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The panel sent a note to U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr. after 2 1/2 
days of deliberations, saying it was deadlocked on the charges against wealthy 
Hawthorne real estate broker William Ross, 52, and Rochelle Ida Manning, 48, a 
Los Angeles-born woman with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
The two are accused of arranging the mailing of a bomb that exploded on July 
17, 1980, killing Patricia Wilkerson, a Manhattan Beach secretary who died when 
a parcel she opened exploded. Prosecutors said the bomb's intended target was 
the dead woman's boss, Brenda Crouthamel, who had sued Ross in a real estate 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian called the jury into court and ordered it to continue deliberations, 
cautioning jurors that a retrial would be expensive and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
The panel did not indicate how it was deadlocked on the two charges against the 
defendants -- aiding and abetting and mailing an explosive device with intent 
to kill.

CITY ATTORNEY'S BATTLE PLAN AGAINST COCAINE OUTLETS FOUNDERS IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER and HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn on Wednesday announced a plan to clamp 
down on motels, apartment buildings and other residences where rock cocaine is 
sold -- but it immediately foundered in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Backed enthusiastically by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Hahn launched the 
narcotics abatement unit of city lawyers who will go to court to shut down what 
Hahn called "cesspools of drug dealing" throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn immediately sent a deputy to court for a restraining order. But Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin was unimpressed with the urgency of the 
problem or the solution touted by Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin declined a request by Deputy City Atty. Kevin T. Ryan for temporary 
restraining orders to force owners and operators of the "rental rock houses" to 
eliminate drug dealing immediately or face closure. Instead, he scheduled a 
court hearing for Feb. 16 on six suits filed by Hahn's new unit. 
</P>
<P>
The next round for the city attorney's office will be to persuade the judge to 
issue a restraining order at that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Drug-Related Activity' 
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, a Times reporter visited some of the sites targeted by Hahn 
and saw what neighbors called "drug-related activity." Wads of bills were 
exchanged surreptitiously near a motel, and pedestrians and automobiles, 
passing by in a stream, stopped at an apartment building suspected of being a 
drug sale site. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they haven't closed it earlier," said Lorenzo Gregg, 32, one of 
a small group of local residents who gathered outside the Gates Hotel, 7814 
Figueroa St., to listen to Hahn and Bradley. "There has been a lot of drug 
trafficking, people getting killed, shot. It's bad for the community. You can't 
even walk around at night." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to quit until we have made every neighborhood in this city 
safe and secure for decent, law-abiding citizens," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officials and police were applauded by members of the Western Heights 
Neighborhood Assn. who waved a placard proclaiming opposition to rock houses, 
places where cocaine is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Chief Glen Levant, who said police made 58,000 drug arrests and 
closed 500 rock houses last year, said Hahn's efforts represent the first 
attack on the motels. He said 200 motels and other sites have been identified 
throughout the city as places where drug dealers operate. 
</P>
<P>
The Gates Motel, where more than 60 arrests have been made in the last two 
years, was one of six sites Hahn's office attempted to close to drug dealers 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Civil suits were filed against owners and operators of each targeted location 
under the state's relatively new Controlled Substances Abatement Act. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after the state's 1912 Red Light Abatement Act, which allowed 
authorities to put houses of prostitution out of business as public nuisances, 
the law enables a judge to padlock the premises of a motel or house used for 
drug trafficking if owners ignore court orders to abate the nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Those found in contempt of court orders banning illegal activity can be fined 
from $500 to $10,000 under the drug abatement law. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no desire to deny anyone the use of their business or home," Hahn 
said. " . . . But the drug trafficking problem in this city is too serious, too 
menacing and too urgent for us to keep fighting with one hand tied behind our 
back." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 12-unit Gates Motel, which Hahn termed "one of the worst 
locations," the suits seek to curtail drug dealing at: 
</P>
<P>
* The 15-unit Mid-Town Motel, 730 S. Alvarado St., where 19 arrests were made 
last year; 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-unit apartment building, 2922 S. Budlong Ave., where 52 arrests were 
made in six months; 
</P>
<P>
* Five adjoining dwellings at 3847-3849 S. Western Ave., with 30 arrests in 18 
months; 
</P>
<P>
* A house at 1733 Longwood Ave., with 10 arrests in two years; 
</P>
<P>
* Another single family dwelling at 2179 W. 21st St., where 15 arrests have 
been made since June. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he hopes his special unit can file suits against similar sites every 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Moszzkley, a security guard at the Dr. Ruth Temple Health Center near 
the Western Avenue site, said young men run through the clinic when the 
purported "crack house" across the street is raided. 
</P>
<P>
"The police make sweeps," he said. "But (the dealers) are like rats. They come 
back."

JUDGE RULES AGAINST A MISTRIAL IN STALKER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the Night Stalker case denied a defense motion for a mistrial 
Wednesday and ordered jury selection to resume in the trial of Richard Ramirez, 
the drifter accused of murdering 13 Los Angeles County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, attorneys will choose 13 alternate jurors and then randomly 
pick one of them to replace a juror who was dismissed for misconduct on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan dismissed juror Rudolph 
Wagner on Tuesday. The judge found that Wagner had violated a court order by 
talking about how he would vote in the penalty phase of the case, assuming a 
guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Tynan had concluded that Wagner, a black, had said in the 
courthouse corridor that he would not condemn defendant Ramirez, a Latino, to 
die because there already is a disproportionate number of minorities on Death 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation against Wagner was made last week by two women who were among 
the pool of prospective jurors. Both of them, Deborah A. Drake and Janet Maack 
also have been excused from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's lawyer, Daniel Hernandez, asked for the mistrial late Wednesday 
afternoon, using Wagner's dismissal as grounds. If the judge had ruled in his 
favor, it would have required picking a entire new jury for a trial expected to 
last as long as two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extensive Questioning 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Wagner's remark has prompted extensive individual 
questioning of the remaining 41 jurors and prospective alternate jurors, and 
Tynan has postponed the start of the trial by a week, to Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
When Maack reported Wagner's remark last Thursday, a 12-member jury, including 
Wagner, already had been sworn in. Hernandez and the co-prosecutors, Los 
Angeles Deputy Dist. Attys. Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson, had been in the 
process of picking alternate jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, from El Paso, is accused of murdering 13 Los Angeles County residents 
in a spree of nighttime residential attacks that left many others injured. 
Ramirez also is charged with a 14th murder in San Francisco, as well as 
attempted murder and sexual assault in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
He has been held in Los Angeles County Jail without bail since he was captured 
by citizens in East Los Angeles on Labor Day weekend in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 40 people left in the jury pool that totaled nearly 1,600 when 
jury selection began on July 21.

FINANCIALLY AILING FRENCH HOSPITAL IN CHINATOWN SOUNDS A CRY FOR HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financially ailing French Hospital in Los Angeles' Chinatown has been put up 
for sale, and its operators are asking staff doctors and the surrounding 
community to consider taking over its operation. 
</P>
<P>
The 129-year-old medical facility on West College Street -- built to serve what 
was once a French immigrant settlement surrounding it, but now in the heart of 
Chinatown -- has been suffering for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
According to associate administrator Phyllis Michaelson, there has been a 
declining patient load, a high proportion of indigent patients without 
insurance, and lower payments from Medicare and Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-five (percent) to 90% of our patients are government-paid," she said of 
the 127-bed facility. "And coupled with that, Medi-Cal reimbursements take 
months to get to us." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're down to the bone," added Dr. Shy-Yin Wong, a Chinatown general 
practitioner who serves as the hospital's chief of staff. He predicted that 
without a reorganization, or an infusion of money, the hospital will be forced 
to close within months. 
</P>
<P>
Michaelson said that may not be true, because in recent weeks the patient 
population has nearly doubled to about 100. 
</P>
<P>
"If the census stays up, we could probably struggle along much longer," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
News of the hospital's predicament has sparked concern in Chinatown, because 
the majority of the patients served by the facility are Asian, usually 
non-English-speaking, and at least half the staff is Asian. 
</P>
<P>
A group of physicians and local leaders met with hospital officials Wednesday 
to discuss the situation, including the possibility of raising money to save 
the facility. The hospital land is still owned by the French Society, which 
erected the building in the 1860s. The society leases the land to the nonprofit 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a community hospital, so the community should be involved," 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Matter 
</P>
<P>
A few who attended the meeting said the hospital has gotten fewer patients in 
recent years because the management, which is non-Asian, is not responsive 
enough to the community. 
</P>
<P>
But others said that despite such criticism, the hospital should survive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a health center that needs to be here, particularly with the refugee 
population here," said Wilbur Woo, a director of Chinatown's Cathay Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ideal for Chinatown, since that is the hub of Chinese culture," said 
Irwin Lai, a businessman and restaurant owner who is also on the hospital's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Growth 
</P>
<P>
A surge in residential construction in the nearby hills will add thousands to 
the area's population, Lai said, making the presence of a hospital even more 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the hospital was listed in a national study as being among the 200 
hospitals in the country with the lowest risk-adjusted death rates for Medicare 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Moy, an obstetrician, said he doubted that staff doctors would take over 
ownership of the hospital, saying he thought the Chinese community would not 
trust physicians' motives for hospitalizing patients if they owned the facility 
and profited from the hospitalizations. 
</P>
<P>
"This hospital should belong to the community," he said.

STRONG CHALLENGER FOR YAROSLAVSKY'S 5TH DISTRICT SEAT DROPS OUT OF RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Saltzman, one of Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's strongest 
challengers for the 5th District council seat, dropped out of the race 
Wednesday, leaving the councilman with four opponents leading up to the April 
11 election. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest remaining challenger now appears to be Laura Lake, a slow-growth 
candidate who is receiving support from some of the people who helped Ruth 
Galanter defeat 18-year veteran council member Pat Russell two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Saltzman's withdrawal from the campaign was the latest development in a race 
that took an unusual turn when Yaroslavsky decided not to run against Mayor Tom 
Bradley, believing him to be unbeatable. On Jan. 6, he announced instead that 
he would seek reelection to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Before he made that decision, 5th District candidates had expected a 
competitive race for a seat that Yaroslavsky would have had to give up to run 
for mayor. Now, Yaroslavsky is favored to win another term. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Jack McGrath, who had been helping run Saltzman's campaign, 
entered the race. McGrath, who managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign 
in 1975 and served as the councilman's chief deputy, enters the race with 
little money. Also running are urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th District includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, Century City, Bel-Air, 
Westwood, West Los Angeles and parts of Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Saltzman, a former co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985 reelection campaign and a 
former Westside deputy to Bradley, had vowed to stay in the race after 
Yaroslavsky decided to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed His Mind 
</P>
<P>
But after assessing his chances, he changed his mind Wednesday and endorsed 
Yaroslavsky for reelection. "I came to the conclusion that I would have to 
raise an extraordinary amount of money and run a highly negative campaign," he 
said. "That's not why I went into public service." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Saltzman's support also began to erode when Yaroslavsky decided to run 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, on leave from her job as a UCLA professor of environmental sciences to 
campaign full time, contends that Yaroslavsky is vulnerable because he has been 
"on the wrong side" of several important growth battles in his district. She 
kicked off her campaign earlier this week with a press conference at the 
Westside Pavilion shopping mall, where traffic problems and a proposed 
expansion have generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Difference' 
</P>
<P>
She said Wednesday that Saltzman's withdrawal from the race "makes no 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
"The race has always been about whether we will have a council person who is 
willing to fight for the neighborhoods that are crowded with growth and traffic 
congestion and threatened with crime or a council person who is marking time 
until he has a safe race for mayor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lake's campaign has been bolstered by a cadre of people who helped Galanter 
defeat Russell on a wave of homeowner discontent over Russell's pro-development 
record. Among those working for Lake are Marcela Howell, who was Galanter's 
campaign manager; Ben Goddard, who handled political mailings for Galanter, and 
Don May, a California League of Conservation Voters activist who helped 
organize a door-to-door campaign for Galanter, said Rick Ruiz, Galanter's press 
aide who is also a volunteer on the Lake campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Concerned' 
</P>
<P>
Galanter endorsed Lake when Yaroslavsky was expected to run for mayor. Aides to 
the councilwoman, who will not return from a trip to Antarctic until Monday, 
said they do not know if she will continue to back Lake against a council 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned," Yaroslavsky said about his reelection Wednesday, adding 
that he plans to wage an all-out campaign nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of the 5th District, the people of the city, know me. . . . I 
co-authored the most comprehensive land-use initiative, Proposition U, ever 
written in this country.

Motorola Corp. sued Hitachi Ltd. and two U.S. distributors, charging patent 
infringement and unfair competition in the sale of microprocessors. The suit, 
filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, accuses Tokyo-based Hitachi of 
engaging in unfair competition with its new microprocessor. Motorola, based in 
Schaumburg, Ill., says the unfair competition began shortly after it granted a 
patent license to Hitachi for its MC6800-68000 family of microprocessors in 
May, 1986. A hearing will be held today on Motorola's request for an injunction 
halting sales of Hitachi's H-8 microprocessor.

Canadian brewer Molson Cos. and Australian beer maker Elders IXL Ltd. said they 
would merge their Canadian beer operations to create the country's largest 
brewery and try to grab a greater share of the U.S. market. Molson Breweries, 
formed by the merger of Molson's and Elders' Carling O'Keefe Breweries of 
Canada Ltd., will be Canada's largest beer maker with 17 breweries, officials 
said. The new, equally owned venture now ships 15 million cases of beer a year 
to the United States but hopes to boost those exports to about 40 million 
cases.

The Transportation Department gave tentative approval to the sale of the 
lucrative Eastern Airlines shuttle to Trump. The price tag for the sale, which 
was announced in October by Trump and Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent 
company, is $365 million. The shuttle, Eastern's only profitable operation, has 
hourly, non-reservation flights between New York and Washington and New York 
and Boston. The Transportation Department said it found Trump's plans for the 
carrier sound financially and that his key personnel have the necessary 
managerial and technical skills. The Trump Shuttle still must pass a safety 
review by the Federal Aviation Administration before the sale can be completed.

OIL PRICES CONTINUE RUN AS FUTURES HIT 14-MONTH HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surge in oil prices continued Wednesday, surprising many industry observers 
and prompting some to reassess the price outlook. Futures contracts for crude 
oil settled above $19 a barrel at their highest level in 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange drove oil prices 53% above the 
level reached as recently as Oct. 5, before the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries forged its latest production-cutting agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the steady price run-up is at or near its peak, 
particularly as spring approaches and a seasonal decline in oil demand sets in. 
Some expect prices to tumble soon, especially if OPEC's newest stance of unity 
appears to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
But some were cautiously adding $1 or $2 a barrel to their full-year price 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been surprised by the extent of the price run-up, but not by the 
pattern," said Thomas Burns, manager of the economic staff at Chevron Corp. in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC's apparent success to date in following the accord is an 
important reason for the big rise, economists said other factors -- especially 
the consistent evidence that the world is using far more oil than was realized 
-- are also playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
The price spike was not the only event pointing to a strengthening oil market 
Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks 
dropped 4.4 million barrels in the week ending Jan. 15 to 329 million, or 19 
million barrels less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
This continues a pattern and bolsters recent signals that demand for oil is 
stronger than expected. The International Energy Agency, in the wake of upward 
revisions of forecasts by private economists, recently boosted its estimate of 
last year's worldwide oil demand growth to 2.6% from 1.8% -- a difference of 
about 400,000 barrels a day. Others put it higher. 
</P>
<P>
Coming at a time OPEC producers are thought to be cutting production by an 
estimated 16% under terms of the cartel's agreement that took effect Jan. 1, 
the events suggest a tightening of supplies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, noted analyst Paul D. Mlotok at Salomon Bros. in New York, the 
loss of production at several oil rigs in Britain's North Sea -- including the 
disastrous explosion aboard an Occidental Petroleum platform -- has taken 
400,000 barrels a day off the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is happening at once," said Mlotok. While the North Sea problems 
and the OPEC unity might not last forever, he said, "the increased demand has 
ongoing significance." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's price for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, ended 
31 cents higher at $19.26 a barrel for the current February contract. The low 
of recent months was $12.60 a barrel in early October. 
</P>
<P>
The new cooperation within OPEC has prompted another effort at enlisting 
non-OPEC oil-producing nations in the cause of cutting production worldwide. 
Experts from several nations, including Mexico, Egypt, Oman and others, are to 
meet late this month in London to discuss such a plan.

NATIONAL LAMPOON TO GIVE 3 SEATS TO INVESTOR GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
National Lampoon Inc. announced Wednesday that it would give an upstart 
investor group three seats on its board, plus a novel status in day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, public documents disclosed, the agreement provides that 
independent producers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson might be hired to share 
the office of the president under founder Matty Simmons, who also is chairman 
of the publicly traded magazine and movie company. 
</P>
<P>
If Grodnik and Matheson obtain those positions by March 15, the investor group 
pledged not to put up another -- conceivably opposing -- slate of directors at 
the next shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from New York, the producers said they intend to 
invest new capital in the firm and explore an expansion in entertainment areas 
beyond publishing and film and television production. 
</P>
<P>
Grodnik and his partner in Grodnik/Matheson Co. had been negotiating with 
Simmons since Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
They went into the talks armed with the backing of holders of 21% of the 
company's stock. The two were accompanied by their investment adviser, David 
Batchelder, who had been strategist for Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. in 
various corporate raids before setting up an investment banking firm in La 
Jolla last year. 
</P>
<P>
Their campaign was always meant as a friendly involvement, Grodnik and Matheson 
insisted. Matheson added that "it never hurts to have 21% of the stock," and 
they both chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the new directors, the company's board is being expanded to 
seven from four seats. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the investor group's demand for a hand in day-to-day operations, 
Simmons agreed to the creation of a new three-member "executive management 
committee." Its three members -- Grodnik, Matheson and a Nebraska ally, Alan S. 
Parsow -- will "make recommendations to the board of directors and officers 
concerning the management of the company," the firm's announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of the agreement filed by the investor group with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is to open employment 
negotiations with Grodnik and Matheson immediately.

U.S. INDUSTRY OPERATING AT HIGHEST RATE IN 9 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
U.S. industry operated at its highest rate in nine years last month, the 
government reported Wednesday, but analysts said the modest pace of growth 
should allay fears of increasing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Use of industrial capacity at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 
percentage point to 84.2% last month, the highest rate since it hit 84.3% in 
November, 1979, the Federal Reserve said. The operating rate for November, 
1988, was a revised 84.1%, and October's figure was 84.0%. 
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying report, the agency said industrial production climbed a 
moderate 0.3% in December following a revised increase of 0.4% in November. 
</P>
<P>
While high operating rates can cause concern that factories will have trouble 
meeting demand, resulting in shortages and higher prices, economists said 
December's increases were small enough that they didn't point to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Chimerine of the Wefa Group, consultants in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the 
reports were "consistent with continued recovery in the industrial sector and 
moderate growth in the economy as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the best of both worlds," he said. "It showed continued 
expansion but at a moderate pace." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International in New York said that while 
operating rates were high, the specter of inflation "doesn't seem to be as much 
on our doorstep as some people have pretended." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Brusca expressed concern that production "is not increasing 
fast enough to satisfy domestic demand and to make progress" on the U.S. trade 
deficit, which widened to $12.5 billion in November.

STOCKS STAGE BROAD ADVANCE; DOW UP 24.11

<P>
Unfazed by disappointing news on international trade, stock prices staged a 
broad advance Wednesday that carried the market to new highs since the 1987 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to 2,238.75, surpassing 
the recovery peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume reached 187.54 million shares, its highest level so far in the 
new year, up from 143.93 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the nation's trade deficit 
widened to $12.51 billion in November from a revised $10.26 billion the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters said they were heartened to see the market shrugging off 
unfavorable news on the trade situation, which has been a touchy issue for the 
markets for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, stock prices climbed to a record on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange as investors shrugged off late profit-taking pressure. The Nikkei 
average of 225 selected issues climbed 127.03 to close at a record 31,354.55. 
</P>
<P>
London stocks also extended their recent broad-based rally in active trading, 
reaching their best levels since the 1987 stock crash. The Financial Times 
100-share index closed up 24.4 at 1,892.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Money traders scrambled to buy dollars Wednesday and boosted the currency 
despite the surprisingly big monthly U.S. trade deficit, confounding 
conventional wisdom that when the imbalance grows, the dollar drops. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the dollar's strength grew despite repeated intervention by seven 
central banks, including the Federal Reserve and West Germany's Bundesbank. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined initially when the trade number was released, but quickly 
stabilized against key currencies -- a signal to professional speculators that 
the dollar was undervalued and that they should buy it. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve entered the market at least three times to peddle dollars, 
but traders said the moves only slowed the dollar's rise and provided more 
opportunities for buying what they considered cheap dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, also undaunted by the disappointing trade report, surged higher 
amid speculation that inflation might moderate. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year issue finished up 11/16 point, or nearly $7 for each 
$1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which often indicates overall interest 
rate trends, declined to 8.82% from late Tuesday's 8.89%. 
</P>
<P>
The credit markets also gained strength from speculation that West Germany's 
Bundesbank would increase its discount rate, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.938%, down from 9.24% late Tuesday.

SALE OF EASTERN'S SHUTTLE TO TRUMP WINS FIRST OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Transportation Department gave tentative approval Wednesday to the 
sale of the lucrative Eastern Airlines shuttle to flamboyant real estate tycoon 
Donald J. Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for the sale, which was announced in October by Trump and Texas 
Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, is $365 million. The shuttle, Eastern's 
only profitable operation, has hourly, non-reservation flights between New York 
and Washington and New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Observers have called the deal a coup for Trump, who probably would expand the 
shuttle's service to Atlantic City, the East Coast's gambling mecca. Trump owns 
two large hotel-casinos there and has a 12% stake in Resorts International, 
which is building a casino and hotel in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department said it found Trump's plans for operating the 
carrier to be sound financially and that his key personnel have the necessary 
managerial and technical skills. The Trump Shuttle still must pass a safety 
review by the Federal Aviation Administration before the sale can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The way was cleared for the transaction to move ahead when a federal court last 
month denied the objections of labor unions that challenged the sale as a 
union-busting tactic by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air. The unions had 
maintained that the sale was part of a plan by Texas Air, which also owns 
non-union Continental Airlines, to dismantle Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, industry sources said Wednesday that Eastern, in another 
divestiture move, is close to selling its operations at Philadelphia to USAir 
Group for about $80 million. Eastern, which has lost more than $1 billion in 
the last 10 years, in August eliminated service to 14 cities, closed its Kansas 
City hub and dismissed 12% of its work force.

This may be the first time that seasoning packets have been sold as official 
inaugural memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
"They reflect the life style of the First Family," said Lisa Goddard, assistant 
director of promotion for the Inaugural Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Although President-elect George Bush and his family are developing a reputation 
more for their love of Chinese food than down-home Texas cooking, Goddard 
thought the items were "great. I don't think I've ever seen seasoning mix in an 
inaugural catalogue. Someone here is cooking it up right now, and it smells 
great." 
</P>
<P>
The $7.50 trio of seasoning mixes -- Texas chili, barbecue and gumbo -- is one 
of 48 items in the official American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural 
commemorative catalogue and is among the hundreds of souvenir items being sold 
by street vendors and local merchants as tourists descend on the town for 
inaugural festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the JW Marriott Hotel, one of the first of 20 official souvenir stands, 
vendor Bernard Lloyd reported that T-shirts ($10) and sweat shirts ($39.95) 
were selling well. He expected pennants to do better when the parade gets under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
What wasn't hot? A giant Nestles Crunch bar with inaugural stickers at $2. 
Displayed at the stand was a sample vanity inaugural license plate ($50 for six 
letters, good in all states) that was curiously stamped "NANCY." 
</P>
<P>
The Inaugural Committee's catalogue also includes such pricey items as a 
Steuben glass eagle atop a crystal ball: $1,195. A Boehm porcelain eagle sells 
for the same price. But Goddard was quick to note that there were other, more 
affordable items, like a 95-cent inaugural book cover. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the top criteria was that the items had to be affordable," she said. 
They also had to be made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other "Bush life style" items include a $35 man's golf shirt. "It looks like 
George Bush's favorite golf shirt," Goddard said. "He likes the way the pocket 
buttons and it has longer tails in back. And it's his favorite color blue." 
</P>
<P>
Blue is the predominant color of the merchandise, including a travel umbrella 
($20), coffee mug ($10) and hat and muffler set ($15). 
</P>
<P>
Bush's penchant for horseshoes is reflected in a horseshoe design belt buckle 
($25) and key ring ($8). 
</P>
<P>
Goddard wouldn't speculate on how much the committee hopes to raise from sales 
of souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell," she said. "In 1985, we raised $2 million." Considering 
that year the parade was canceled due to bad weather and it was the second 
inaugural for President Reagan, vendors are hopeful they'll hear the happy 
ringing of cash registers this time around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For the Democrats 
</P>
<P>
There is even something for nostalgic Democrats -- one street vendor had an old 
Mondale-Ferraro campaign button for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Inaugural Committee expects competition from other merchants waiting to 
cash in on memorabilia and from bootleggers. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll happen," Goddard said. "Some of the things get bootlegged. But," she 
sniffed, "it's usually the sorts of things we'd never do anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Not all souvenirs being offered are reverential to the offices of President and 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The Fit to a Tee T-shirt shops in Alexandria, Va., and Georgetown report good 
sales of a shirt emblazoned, "Hey George! You've just been elected president of 
the United States! What are you going to do now?" "I'm going to Disney World!" 
proclaims a smiling, waving Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Another shirt features Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle as wine-cooler 
hawkers Bartles &amp; Jaymes. "Thanks for your support," it reads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where's Quayle? 
</P>
<P>
Absent from most of the memorabilia, official and unofficial, are the 
likenesses of Quayle and his wife Marilyn. The Inaugural Committee catalogue 
merchandise features them on buttons and offers a color photo of Bush and 
Quayle in a "leather-like booklet" with the oaths of office ($17.50). 
</P>
<P>
It's customary with official commemoratives, Goddard explained, to concentrate 
on the likeness of the President. 
</P>
<P>
That may disappoint some Los Angeles residents who were hoping for irreverent 
Quayle merchandise from friends visiting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle did turn up in public display, in a corner window at Garfinckel's 
department store at 14th and F streets. There a display features a photo 
blow-up of George Bush. Standing behind him, partially hidden, is Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to pretend to be witty or make any kind of comment. It was 
simply logistics," explained Jeffrey Mattson, the store's director of visual 
merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it that way because of the size of the blow-ups," he said. "We tried 
three or four possibilities, and this seems to be the one that worked best 
visually. I wasn't sure that when I saw Quayle's face behind Bush and cut off, 
that we wouldn't get comments . . . a lot of people could find humor in that, 
depending on how they viewed the vice president." 
</P>
<P>
He has received no negative comments, so far. But if he did receive a call from 
an official wanting the window changed? "If someone raised a fuss, we'd try to 
come up with another solution. We're not out to offend anyone."

AN ODD TROVE OF GIFTS AT THE PRESIDENT'S ALMA MATER PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE 
LIGHTER SIDE OF A LEGACY

<P>
They are all here. The footballs autographed "for the Gipper," cowboy boots 
bearing the presidential seal, T-shirts emblazoned with "Daffy Kadaffy" and 
"Hugs Not Drugs," books on topics as obscure as chiropractic ethics and 
baseball caps from the Hoboken Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of gifts that Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan have received during two presidential terms. Now that they are moving 
across the country after eight years in the White House, there are a lot of 
possessions to sort out with care. Because these items were presented to the 
President and his First Lady, in one way or another they bear the stamp of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of items have been given to the President in eight years. I've never 
known of any to be thrown away," White House spokesman Mark Weinberg said. 
"Every item is of importance to the Reagans. These gifts are part of the Reagan 
presidency. The Reagans don't view (them) as personal gifts but as gifts to the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has selected his alma mater, Eureka College, as a repository for what 
might be called the light side of his legacy. It was of the picturesque college 
here in the heart of Illinois corn country that Reagan, class of '32, said: 
"Everything I am started in Eureka." A "C" student known as Dutch, Reagan was 
active in theater and student government, lettered in football and was 
cheerleader for the basketball team. All the while he worked in the cafeteria 
to help pay tuition fees. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, Reagan has directed more than 1,000 items from his broadcasting, 
film and political careers to the small liberal arts college here, which had 
hoped to receive his personal papers. Those papers, however, will be housed at 
the future Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The college has packed more than 160 shelves with commemorative plaques Reagan 
received from the likes of the U.S. Forest Service and the Touchdown Club of 
Washington. The college boasts of hundreds of keys to cities as diverse as 
Cleveland, Vallejo, Calif., and Roanoke, Va., and possesses Reagan's lifetime 
membership cards to the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn., the Iowa 
Sportscasters Assn. and the U.S. Polo Team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Autographed Books 
</P>
<P>
College administrators are now sorting through the contents of about two dozen 
cardboard boxes they will add to the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential Memorabilia 
Collection that have been shipped from the White House in the last few months. 
Among the hundreds of items are books -- some signed by notables such as 
Ferdinand Marcos, Jimmy Carter, actress Jane Seymour, Henry Kissinger and Jeane 
Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Now that amounts to a lot of stuff -- or artifacts -- for the American people 
and for Eureka. And, to the untrained eye, some of it may appear less than 
historically significant. 
</P>
<P>
Not true, said Ray Browne, a popular culture specialist at Ohio's Bowling Green 
University. "This kind of stuff is significant because it reveals a level and 
an area of things that social historians 100 years from now will be 
tremendously interested in," Browne said. "All of these things are extremely 
important, not so much in themselves perhaps but in the total picture." 
</P>
<P>
"I am most interested in the books," Eureka College President George A. Hearne 
said of the collection." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Richard M. Nixon's book "Leaders" bears a simple inscription: 
"To President Reagan. Another Great Leader." A volume from Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass) about the role of Irish politicians is dated St. Patrick's 
Day, 1981, and reads: "For our Irish President from his fellow Irishman." 
</P>
<P>
Beside the gifts the Reagans have received, they have given the college samples 
of the gifts the two have bestowed on friends and supporters. Almost all are in 
blue boxes with a gold presidential seal and signature. Among them, a tiny 
piece of the cork floor removed from the Oval Office in 1969 and preserved in 
Lucite, a presidential golf ball, a jar of jelly beans and a yo-yo. 
</P>
<P>
A brass belt buckle that depicts a bronco-busting Reagan on the White House 
lawn bears the words "The buckaroo stops here" and represents the "close 
connection" Reagan felt with the Southwest, said Lynn Beer, a Eureka College 
administrator. Beer, like Hearne, stressed the "special relationship Reagan has 
maintained with Eureka College" since his college days that began six decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have yet to arrive, Eureka College president Hearne said he 
"already can see a set of large black-and-white photographs of Reagan on the 
walls of the (campus center) the college has yet to build." The center will, 
among other things, house the permanent display the college is planning about 
its most famous graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Eureka already possesses a collection of black-and-white stills, many curling 
from age, from Reagan's movie days. A photograph from the 1940 film "Knute 
Rockne -- All American" in which Reagan played Notre Dame footballer George 
Gipp appears not only in the memorabilia collection but in a college 
promotional brochure. An assortment of footballs recently shipped from the 
White House includes a pigskin signed "One for the Gipper" by a host of Heisman 
Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
For James Combs, a political scientist at Indiana's Valparaiso University who 
studies the role of popular culture in politics, the artifacts to be displayed 
at Eureka College are valuable as symbols of popular culture "which Reagan more 
than any other President has understood and used." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people are sorry to see Reagan go because he reminded them of 
an idyllic America in which there were no problems, no troubles (and) in which 
we had a bright rosy future. Queen Elizabeth once said that the royal family 
was in the happiness business. The Reagans have been our popular royalty."

She's not exactly a living doll, but she is a doll, this Nancy Reagan in her 
1981 inaugural ball gown. And bargain of bargains, for $235, payable in six 
easy monthly installments, she'll stand on your shelf for years to come, a 
19-inch-high memento of the glamorous Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
It's all news to the White House, which says Mrs. Reagan has no knowledge of or 
connection to Nancy Doll. 
</P>
<P>
It's also news to the Smithsonian's Museum of American History, which owns the 
original -- not Nancy, but the white satin, heavily beaded, lace overlay, James 
Galanos-designed dress the doll appears in. 
</P>
<P>
In its national advertising campaign, Danbury Mint of Norwalk, Conn. -- a 
commercial outfit that sells high-priced trinkets aimed at would-be collectors 
-- calls Nancy Doll "the first in an exciting new series" being dubbed 
"America's First Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
But the company isn't responding to media inquiries about the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
But the Smithsonian experts have plenty to say. One criticism is that the 
artist was "almost cruel" in interpreting Mrs. Reagan's figure. "When her 
husband came into office she was not nearly so thin and gaunt as now," an 
expert said. "The doll exaggerates that and it was unnecessary."

40 AFTERSHOCKS RECORDED AFTER 5.0 QUAKE AT MALIBU ROCKS WIDE AREA; 4 INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least 40 aftershocks were recorded early today in the wake of an earthquake 
that was centered in the Malibu area, causing minor damage and slightly 
injuring at least four people. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate quake, measuring 5 on the Richter scale, hit at 10:56 p.m 
Wednesday. It was centered in the Santa Monica Bay about 8 miles south of 
Malibu and was felt from San Diego County 100 miles south to Santa Barbara, 
about 100 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech seismic analyst Steve Bryant said 20 aftershocks were recorded before 1 
a.m. -- the largest measuring 3.3 on a composite seismographic scale. Since 1 
a.m., at least 20 more were registered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With a quake this size, we expect to see (aftershocks) for several days," 
Bryant said. "They should decrease after a while." 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5 is classified as "moderate," capable of causing minor 
damage if centered in an urban area. 
</P>
<P>
The quake shook office buildings 25 miles away in downtown Los Angeles with a 
rolling motion for 10 to 15 seconds, but was felt as a sharp jolt closer to the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, an early assessment showed only minor damage, sheriff's Lt. Jim 
Glazar said. 
</P>
<P>
The rumble sent rocks tumbling down from the mountainside onto the road through 
Malibu Canyon and toppled bottles and jars from shelves at a Hughes' Market, 
causing several thousand dollars damage to merchandise in the store, Manager 
Kelly Seidel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit real hard down here," Seidel said, noting that several shoppers in the 
store abandoned their shopping carts when the shaking started and ran outside. 
</P>
<P>
Glazar said the quake also pushed six cans and a bottle of beer onto the floor 
of the evidence locker of the Malibu sheriff's station, where they were being 
held for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"When the evidence custodian came in this morning, she found a big puddle of 
beer on the floor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, the quake shattered a 10-by-15-foot storefront window at a 
downtown J. C. Penney Co. and caused a few small cracks in the stucco at City 
Hall, police Lt. Roy McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals reported that four people were treated for cuts and other minor 
injuries, including a woman who broke her foot when she jumped out of bed, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water and Power said more than 90,000 people were momentarily 
without electricity because of automatic shutdowns of some equipment due to the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said there are several large fault lines in the coastal area where the 
quake was centered, including the Elysian Park and Torrance-Wilmington faults.

CALTRANS CHIEF PREDICTS 'TREMENDOUS TRAFFIC SNARL' ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To build a new freeway on an old freeway, that's the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But the hardest part in Caltrans' 10-year project to widen the Santa Ana 
Freeway will be to keep construction crews working while hundreds of thousands 
of cars an hour thunder -- and sometimes crawl -- up and down Orange County's 
major north-south artery. 
</P>
<P>
Optimistic transportation officials Wednesday unveiled specifics of how they 
plan to keep traffic moving during the next decade while they widen the aging 
Interstate 5 from six to 12 lanes from its convergence with Interstate 405 at 
the southern edge of Irvine to Interstate 605 in the north. 
</P>
<P>
In a variety of projects planned solely to help drivers navigate the freeway 
while work is going on, transportation agencies will be spending $2 million 
over the next 2 years on such things as free tow trucks, radio transmitters and 
changeable message signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate there's going to be a tremendous traffic snarl," said Keith 
McKean, head of Caltrans in Orange County. "We hope the public will join us in 
a spirit of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
The freeway was built when the region was primarily farms and scattered homes, 
McKean pointed out. He said some of the old on-ramps were built in a rush and 
are "kinda Mickey Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans promises to keep at least three lanes open in each direction for 
"normal-hours traffic" during the $1-billion construction project. Late at 
night, lanes will close occasionally as overpasses are pulled down and rebuilt, 
but only one direction -- northbound or southbound -- will be shut down at a 
time, McKean said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's bus agency is also ready to help out, said James Reichert, 
executive director of the Orange County Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens have been hollering for changes," Reichert said in his opening 
remarks. "Well, they're going to get them. It's going to be hectic for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
The bus district hopes to woo 700 to 1,000 cars off the Santa Ana Freeway 
during peak hours through ride-sharing and van pools, Reichert said. Brian 
Pearson, OCTD director of development, talked about reducing fares on selected 
bus routes, but he had no specifics Wednesday on which routes, when or how big 
the cuts would be. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, there may also be money available to companies and individuals 
as an incentive to car-pool, OCTD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, however, has more ambitious plans to alleviate congestion during the 
long crush. 
</P>
<P>
A new radio transmitter will go up next month at the juncture of the San Diego 
and Santa Ana freeways in southern Orange County that will have a signal range 
of up to 5 miles. Caltrans already has a transmitter at the Costa Mesa and 
Santa Ana freeways interchange so commuters can tune in 530 AM to hear the 
latest California Highway Patrol traffic reports during rush hour. The new 
transmitter will provide the same service to northbound commuters in the El 
Toro and Irvine areas. At off-peak times, the transmitters will broadcast 
information about upcoming construction work and closures. 
</P>
<P>
So-called "Orange Angel" tow trucks will prowl the first section of the 
freeway-widening project (between the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways) to 
haul disabled vehicles off the road, "basically because there won't be any 
(freeway lane) shoulder left," a Caltrans spokeswoman said. The towing will be 
free but details of how many trucks and when they begin operation have yet to 
be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Caltrans is posting six new changeable message signs along the 
construction corridor to warn motorists of looming disasters. These are 
scheduled to go up next year, a Caltrans spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the major incentive to keep as many motorists off the freeway as possible 
will be fear, McKean said. 
</P>
<P>
When drivers begin encountering the jackhammers, slowdowns, dump trucks and 
bulldozers, they will quickly adapt and switch to surface streets or avoid 
trips altogether, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a nice 10-year Olympics," he said, a reference to the 
steps taken 5 years ago when Los Angeles was host to the Olympics and various 
plans were adopted to prevent or clear up traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the freeway-widening plan includes five major projects along 
the Santa Ana Freeway: 
</P>
<P>
* Reconstruction of the Costa Mesa-Santa Ana freeways interchange. Completion 
scheduled for mid-1994. Work already under way. 
</P>
<P>
* New Tustin Ranch Road overcrossing and interchange in Tustin. Completion 
scheduled for late summer of 1990. Work to start in winter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Reconstruction and widening of the Jamboree Road interchange and 
undercrossing (at what is now the Myford Road undercrossing) in Irvine. 
Scheduled for completion in late 1990. Work already under way. 
</P>
<P>
* Realignment and widening of the Jeffrey Road interchange and overcrossing in 
Irvine. Completion scheduled for summer of 1990. Work to start this spring. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a new overcrossing at Barranca Parkway. Completion scheduled 
for late spring in 1990. Work to start late this spring. 
</P>

COAST GUARD CLARIFIES ITS RULES FOR CHARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard has clarified its definition of a charter-boat passenger and in 
February will resume a crackdown on uncertified charter craft operating from 
Santa Barbara to Dana Point, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard called off its crackdown on unlicensed charter craft along that 
part of the coast in December after it boarded some vessels in Newport Bay that 
had been rented by employers throwing company Christmas parties. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials had contended then that the vessels fit the legal 
definition of charter craft and therefore had to conform to strict licensing 
and safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard now defines charter "passengers" as people who pay in some way 
to be aboard a boat. Owners, crew members or guests who do not pay are not 
considered passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card said operators of charter vessels carrying 
fewer than six passengers must be licensed by the Coast Guard, and charter 
boats carrying more than six passengers must meet federal safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Violators may be fined up to $2,000 a day, and their vessels may be seized 
under certain circumstances, Card said.

<P>
DECK'S DINERS DUMPED AFTER TRUCK RUNS AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A runaway truck crashed into the deck area of the Greeter's Corner Restaurant 
on Wednesday, toppling chairs and patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were unloading a Pack West Paper &amp; Chemical Co. truck at the Hotel 
Laguna about 1:09 p.m. when it rolled away unattended and struck the deck 
behind the restaurant in the 300 block of South Coast Highway, Laguna Beach 
Fire Capt. Eugene D'Isabella said. 
</P>
<P>
"It jarred the people out of their seats," D'Isabella said. Seven people were 
taken to South Coast Medical Center for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them suffered back and neck pain just from falling out of their 
chairs," he said. "Some of them looked bloody, but it turned out to be ketchup 
and food. The truck took that whole deck and shoved it." 
</P>

2 ARRESTED IN THREAT TO POTENTIAL WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two gang members, one a juvenile and the other an adult, were arrested after 
threatening a 15-year-old who was scheduled to be a witness at a gang-shooting 
trial, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Santos Manuel Lopez, 20, of Costa Mesa was arrested Wednesday, and a 
17-year-old Back Bay High School student was arrested Tuesday. Both were taken 
into custody on suspicion of dissuading a witness by threat, a felony, Costa 
Mesa Police Sgt. Ron Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old was "approached in person by an adult and a juvenile male who 
said they were Blood gang members out of Santa Ana," Smith said. "They 
threatened him with physical harm if he appeared to testify against their 
fellow Bloods." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager did not have to testify at the Tuesday trial because the two gang 
members eventually pleaded guilty after plea bargains were arranged, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Five adults and four juveniles were arrested in October for a gang-related 
fistfight and shooting at a shopping center. One teen-ager was injured in the 
fistfight, but no one was shot.

SHOTGUN LEADS TO ARREST OF 3 ROBBERY SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy patrolling Stanton early Wednesday noticed a man running out 
of a convenience store with what appeared to be a shotgun and arrested three 
men on suspicion of armed robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy was driving in a patrol car in front of the Stop 'n' Go market in 
the 8000 block of Orangewood Avenue at 2:26 a.m. when he saw three men run out 
of the store, one carrying something that looked like a shotgun, Sheriff's Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy called for assistance, and after other officers arrived, they 
arrested one man behind the store, another who was hiding in a nearby dumpster 
and a third at Beach Boulevard and Bever Road. 
</P>
<P>
Store workers told police that three men had stolen $20 from the market's cash 
register and fled, Olson said. The shotgun and other robbery evidence were 
recovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men arrested on suspicion of armed robbery were identified as Derold 
Gene Hill, 33, of Fountain Valley; Steven Ray Brown, 22, of Tucson, and Anthony 
Carson Sager, 21, described by authorities as a transient with no known 
address. All are being held in County Jail in Santa Ana with their bail set at 
$50,000 each.

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN TRIANGLE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued for Roberto Tovar Ramirez, 38, in the Dec. 26 
shooting death of a man in what appeared to be a lovers' triangle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremias Diaz Delacruz, 41, of Garden Grove was shot to death while driving a 
van along the 3500 block of Cadillac Avenue. Costa Mesa police said shots were 
fired by the driver of a car, who then fled. 
</P>
<P>
There were three passengers in Delacruz's van, none of whom were able to help 
police identify the assailant. None speaks English. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Capt. Robert Moody said detectives later learned that 
Delacruz had chased the other driver down Harbor Boulevard and both vehicles 
then turned onto Cadillac Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Delacruz got out of his van and then was shot to death by the other driver," 
Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
"After some investigation, we found that the driver of the other car had 
Delacruz's wife in his vehicle that afternoon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Delacruz saw them at a signal light on Harbor Boulevard and chased them. It 
was that old triangle thing." 
</P>
<P>
Moody said a warrant has been issued for Ramirez's arrest on suspicion of 
murder. Ramirez lives in Colton. Investigators are also seeking the slain man's 
wife, Davila Graciela Delacruz, 40, for questioning, he said.

RITES FRIDAY FOR EX-GOP CHAIR E.F. WARD JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be conducted on Friday for Edward F. Ward Jr., former 
chairman of the Orange County Republican Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, 57, of Palm Desert and Newport Beach, died of brain cancer Sunday at Hoag 
Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. Ward, who lived in Orange 
County for many years, was a former administrative assistant to then 
Assemblyman Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Born on Nov. 27, 1931, in San Francisco, Ward was graduated cum laude from 
Stanford University in 1953 with a degree in political science. He participated 
in the university's ROTC program and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 
the U.S. Air Force upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Honorably discharged in 1955, Ward began working as an insurance agent for Jay 
&amp; Renfro of Newport Beach. Between 1971 and July, 1977, he served as 
corporate secretary and director of the Willard Co., an Orange County 
boat-building firm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Ward was elected chairman of the Orange County Republican Central 
Committee, a position he held for about 7 1/2 months until he resigned, citing 
personal business pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Before his election as committee chairman, he served as administrative 
assistant to Badham for about 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ward also was an original member of the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory 
Council, which was formed in 1980. He is survived by his wife, Jean Lea Reed 
Ward; daughters Calene Fleurke and Lea Ward and granddaughters Adrienne and 
Xandria Fleurke. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be conducted at Newport Harbor Lutheran Church in 
Newport Beach. The family requests that any contributions be made to the Orange 
County Sheriff's Advisory Project 999.

A $73-million, high-technology traffic-management system is designed to reduce 
San Diego County freeway congestion by 30% by the year 2005, Caltrans officials 
announced Wednesday. The plan -- a combined effort of Caltrans, the San Diego 
Assn. of Governments and the California Highway Patrol -- will incorporate 
several high-tech projects that were approved in a 1988 State Transportation 
Improvement Plan, said Steve Saville of Caltrans. The project will feature a 
traffic control center at the Caltrans office on Juan Street, a communications 
network, special devices to detect traffic congestion, 170 additional ramp 
meters, 36 closed-circuit TV, 14 message signs, traffic advisory radio stations 
for motorists and three motorist service response teams. The project will cover 
211 miles of Interstate 5, Interstate 8 and California 94.

FPPC LOOKING AT VOTES BY MEMBER OF STATE'S TRANSPORTATION PANEL

The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether a 
prominent San Diego County businessman has violated state conflict-of-interest 
laws by voting to approve millions of dollars of construction projects as a 
member of the California Transportation Commission, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
J. Thomas Hawthorne of Escondido, the exclusive dealer of Caterpillar heavy 
equipment in San Diego, pledged almost three years ago to abstain on 
Transportation Commission votes involving San Diego County after it was 
reported that the builders of almost every local highway project buy or rent 
equipment from his company. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hawthorne has voted for 52 area projects worth $164 million, 
according to a report prepared for the state Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC probe could endanger Hawthorne's seat on the commission, to which he 
has been renominated for a second 4-year term by Gov. George Deukmejian. He is 
now chairman of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday that he 
will delay a scheduled Senate floor vote on Hawthorne's appointment while the 
FPPC reviews the matter. If the Senate does not act by Feb. 1, Hawthorne will 
lose his seat on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate source said the FPPC has asked the Transportation Commission for a 
list of construction contracts awarded on the 52 San Diego projects for which 
Hawthorne voted. FPPC investigators will then check with the contractors to 
determine how much of that business went to Hawthorne's firm, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hawthorne nor the FPPC's spokeswoman could be reached for comment 
Wednesday.

VIETNAMESE INTERPRETERS TO AID SURVIVORS IN STOCKTON ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Vietnamese-speaking Orange County residents flew to Stockton Wednesday to 
help interpret for Southeast Asian students and families traumatized when a 
gunman opened fire on a playground Tuesday, killing five students and injuring 
29 others. 
</P>
<P>
The three, Thang Nguyen, 24, of Garden Grove; Mai Nguyen, 25, and Sanh Tang, 
26, both of Santa Ana, are employees of Pacific Bell at its Vietnamese Service 
Center in Tustin, said Linda Bonniksen, a company spokeswoman who accompanied 
them to Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was arranged after Stockton school district officials issued a plea 
for Vietnamese-speaking interpreters in televised reports of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called District Officials 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, fired an assault rifle at dozens of 
children and school personnel before taking his own life. The student body of 
the elementary school where the incident happened is predominantly Southeast 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
"We called the Stockton school district and asked if they needed help 
translating for children's psychologists, and they said, 'Can you get here in 
10 minutes?' " Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanh Tang, the father of two boys, said: "This is special for me. My wife and I 
watched the (television) news of the shooting and we felt very bad about what 
happened."

SADDLEBACK GETS IT GOING AND BEATS CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Saddleback High School boys' basketball team overcame a sluggish, sloppy 
first half Wednesday night to defeat Corona del Mar, 68-53, in a Sea View 
League game at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners, the county's top-ranked team, looked pretty average in the 
first half, thanks to Corona del Mar's pressing defense. Though Saddleback 
committed 8 turnovers and was outrebounded, 14-9, it managed to hold a halftime 
lead of 27-26. 
</P>
<P>
But a strong third quarter kept the Roadrunners from struggling further. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback opened the third quarter with some impressive defense, forcing 
Corona del Mar out of its normally patient offense. The Sea Kings also lost 
their edge on the boards, as Saddleback outrebounded them, 8-3, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback also found its running game. The Roadrunners sped off 10 unanswered 
points, boosting their lead to 42-32. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Simon, normally Saddleback's point guard and defensive specialist, was the 
team's hotshot in the third quarter. Simon handled the ball well, had 2 steals 
and hit 3 consecutive baskets, including a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback outscored Corona del Mar, 20-10, in the quarter for a 47-36 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taking us a while to get going, but when it's time to kick in gear, we 
do," Saddleback Coach Pat Quinn said. "They get that look in their eye, and I 
know it'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Marshall scored a game-high 17 points and Simon and Malru Dottin each 
added 15 for Saddleback (17-1 overall, 3-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Matt Cwiertnia had 16 points and Brian Spratt 15 for Corona del Mar (12-5, 
2-1). 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we stayed even with them for the first half because we kept them off 
the offensive boards," Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris said. "But the second 
half, they killed us. I thought we got a little tired too." 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 68, Newport Harbor 49 -- Mike Curtis and Guty Heredia each had 16 
points to lead host Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (15-2, 2-1) broke open the game by outscoring Newport Harbor, 18-8, in 
the second quarter to lead, 27-18, at halftime. Scott Gray led Newport Harbor 
(11-8, 0-3) with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
University 61, Tustin 47 -- Stephan Mumaw scored 20 points, Erik Glassen added 
15 and Junior Oliver 12 to give the Trojans (6-11, 1-2) their first league 
victory at Tustin.

PLAN TO CREATE ORANGE COUNTY'S BIGGEST BANKING FIRM DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials for Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills and Landmark Bancorp in La Habra 
said Wednesday that they have canceled their merger plans, scuttling what 
bankers had thought would be an ideal marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Both banking companies said basic operational differences proved too difficult 
to reconcile, and directors and officers at both institutions agreed to drop 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sign a letter of intent, you think you know everything you need to 
know. But you don't," said J.B. Crowell, president and chief executive of 
Eldorado. "We didn't know each other as well as we thought we did, and we both 
concluded that maybe this wasn't going to work." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement reached in mid-November, Landmark would have 
merged its company into Eldorado, with Landmark shareholders getting one share 
of newly issued Eldorado stock for every share of their own company's stock -- 
an aggregate 36.6% stake in the surviving entity. 
</P>
<P>
A merger would have created Orange County's largest banking firm with $400 
million in assets, 310 employees and 12 branches in four counties. 
</P>
<P>
Like any company, Eldorado, which operates eight branches of Tustin-based 
Eldorado Bank, has tried to maximize profits in the last few years. But that 
emphasis led to one of the areas of disagreements with Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get in the top 10% of banks statewide in terms of return on 
equity and return on assets," Crowell said. Reaching high returns on both of 
those standard measures of bank profitability means "you have to watch your 
expenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With about $248 million in assets, Eldorado expects to announce in the next few 
weeks that it posted record profits for 1988, Crowell said. Based on the firm's 
9-month results, it could top $3 million in earnings. Citing the expected good 
results, directors Wednesday declared a 10% stock dividend, payable Feb. 24 to 
shareholders of record as of Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark, which operates Landmark Bank and has about $148 million in assets, 
also expects to post record profits -- more than $1 million -- for last year 
when it releases its results next week, said Craig D. Collette, the company's 
president and chief executive. But Landmark reached its peak performance 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Although Eldorado Bank, for instance, is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday 
through Friday, Landmark is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and a half-day 
on Saturdays, Collette said. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma, he said, was that cutting back hours would have meant losing 
customers at Landmark. Yet increasing Eldorado's hours would have meant more 
expenses and would have cut into that bank's profits. 
</P>
<P>
A host of similar differences in such areas as prices for services, customer 
relations and marketing showed that the two banking companies had "very 
divergent philosophies" of operating banks and that the differences were "deal 
killers," Collette said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Crowell said, each bank had misperceptions going into the deal. 
Eldorado, for instance, figured Landmark was heavily involved in commercial 
loan activity, but it learned that Landmark's commercial loan portfolio was no 
bigger than its own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how different each of us are," Collette said. "We suspected it, 
but we thought we could work something out. It wasn't a question of one side 
backing down. Neither of us wanted to lose customers or profits."

Aerojet Ordnance said the prospect of federal budget cuts has prompted a 
decision by the defense contractor to close its headquarters in Tustin and 
transfer all 108 employees to Downey by summer. "In light of the defense 
picture, this is a really good business move for us. We are just maximizing our 
resources," Aerojet spokesman Timothy Doyle said. The company, which makes 
ammunition, cluster bombs, and warheads, already operates a manufacturing plant 
in Downey. Aerojet's Tustin operation was limited to administration and 
research. Late last year, Aerojet, a subsidiary of Ohio-based GenCorp Inc., 
transferred more than 90 Orange County workers to a newly formed division in 
Azusa. GenCorp had sales of $1.6 billion and earned $155 million in fiscal 
1987.

PEROT TO INVEST MILLIONS IN ARCHIVE CORP., BECOME PART OWNER OF ITS NEW 
PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot will invest millions of dollars in Costa Mesa's 
Archive Corp. in return for the right to buy more than 1 million shares of 
common stock and part ownership of any new products developed by the 
manufacturer of computer tape drives. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of an agreement announced Wednesday, Archive gets to use Perot's 
cash to develop new products so the company does not have to spend some of the 
$28 million of its own money that it has stockpiled to buy other technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The infusion of cash also comes just before Archive must face a potentially 
costly lawsuit by another tape drive manufacturer, alleging that Archive 
infringed on its patent. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company wanted to say much about the complicated deal Wednesday or 
disclose how much money Perot is investing. Perot's company, the Dallas-based 
Perot Group, said only that Perot was introduced to Archive management in July 
"through a mutual friend." 
</P>
<P>
If Perot buys all 1 million shares that Archive has agreed to issue, he would 
own about 7% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Archive said it wants to perfect new types of tape drives to 
help the company maintain its leading share of the $400-million market for 
5.25-inch tape drives. 
</P>
<P>
Tape drives convert information stored on magnetic tapes into signals that can 
be used by a computer. Archive has about 20% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Such technology investment deals were common in the high-tech industries in the 
1970s, when investors could get tax write-offs for investing in research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Since the tax laws changed, however, such deals are less common. In fact, this 
is the first such deal Perot has entered, said Steve Blasnik of Perot Group. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could find more of them as attractive as this one, we'd do them," 
Blasnik said. 
</P>
<P>
The way the deal works, in broad outline, is that Perot will probably sell his 
share of any new technology the company develops to Archive, possibly in return 
for more stock. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to end up being a part owner of Archive, not of a specific 
technology," Blasnik said. 
</P>
<P>
Perot is a colorful, opinionated, influential executive. He started Electronic 
Data Systems in 1962 with $1,000 and is now worth $3 billion, the third-largest 
private fortune in the nation. After selling EDS to General Motors, he 
quarreled publicly and bitterly with the giant auto maker from his seat on the 
GM board. 
</P>
<P>
Perot has been increasingly involved in investing venture capital in new 
companies in return for company part-ownerships. Perot recently plunked $20 
million into Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs' NeXT computer company. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, some of Perot's ventures have missed the mark. His new 
data-processing company, Perot Systems Corp., recently lost out on a Postal 
Service contract and a bid to handle the Texas Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
Archive, meanwhile, has its own problems. Cipher Data Products Inc. of San 
Diego has accused Archive of stealing some of its technology and incorporated 
it in Archive's own tape drives. 
</P>
<P>
Archive denied that and targeted two lawsuits of its own against Cipher. 
</P>
<P>
The Cipher suit could come to trial as early as May. Analysts said Cipher's 
case was bolstered last year when it won a similar suit against Wangtek, a unit 
of Culver City-based Rexon. 
</P>
<P>
Wangtek agreed to pay damages and royalties, which add to a company's cost of 
production and make it less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Archive has been consistently profitable in the last few years, reporting 
profits of $10.5 million on sales of $122.7 million for its latest fiscal year, 
ending in September.

When Paul Neathery of Buena Park discovered that the used 1987 Lincoln he 
bought last year from a Fullerton car dealer had previously been driven as a 
rental, he was not a happy customer. 
</P>
<P>
As a former employee at a major car-rental agency, Neathery had seen first-hand 
"the abuse that rental cars receive from those who drive them," he said in a 
court declaration. And if he had known that his car was among that lot, 
Neathery says he would never have bought it. 
</P>
<P>
He was among more than two dozen local customers who complain that they did not 
get the cars they had banked on, the Orange County district attorney's office 
charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a civil action filed in Superior Court in Santa Ana, the office's consumer 
protection unit charged that four Fairway car dealerships in Orange County had 
failed to tell unwitting buyers that some of their used cars had been driven as 
rentals. Such notification is required by state motor vehicle codes. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, salespeople at the Fairway dealerships told "outright lies" to 
make prospective buyers think that they were getting low-mileage, "executive" 
cars driven by rental-company officials, demonstration models or used cars 
driven by a single owner, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy Brough said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The civil charges were brought against the Fairway dealers after the Department 
of Motor Vehicles conducted a random registration and sales check on the 
history of used cars sold by Fairway and other dealers. The inquiry, prompted 
by a customer complaint, identified 29 Fairway customers who had bought rental 
cars but said they were not informed of that fact. 
</P>
<P>
At least three other local dealerships are also being investigated for similar 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
John D. McGuire, an attorney for the Fairway dealerships, said in an interview 
that the company's sales people did inform car buyers verbally that the used 
cars had been rentals, if that fact was known. In some cases, he said, the 
dealer buys the car at auction and has no way of knowing its history. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway dealers "have always prided themselves on selling a good product and 
following the law, and this is really an insult to their integrity," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's really been hurt," McGuire said. "When you really unwind this thing, 
the customers got what they paid for." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, none of the 29 customers cited by the district attorney's office 
complained about the condition of their cars. They said, however, that they 
felt deceived because they thought they were buying a different car. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a fear that rental cars would not have been well-maintained, most 
customers said they would not have bought their cars if they had known their 
true history. A few said they would have paid several thousand dollars less. 
</P>
<P>
By leading the customers to believe that they were buying standard used cars 
instead of rentals, Brough said, the Fairway dealers "were exploiting the 
feelings of many people that non-rentals would be maintained better." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is asking the court in its civil action to order 
Fairway to compensate the unknowing customers and to pay fines that could 
amount to $2,500 for each case cited. Fairway turned down an offer from the 
district attorney's office to settle the dispute out of court for about 
$200,000, McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney is also seeking an injunction that would bar Fairway from 
such deceptive practices in the future. But McGuire said the injunction is a 
moot point, since Fairway has already instituted a new policy requiring that 
all rental cars be marked and that all buyers sign forms stating that they knew 
the history of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway has Toyota and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in Fullerton, as well as 
Ford and Volkswagen dealerships in Placentia.

Stretching seems like simplicity itself: You just extend an arm or a leg and 
feel tension and soreness melt away. Exercisers, who know stretching is an 
integral part of any workout, know that it also improves flexibility and 
coordination, helps prevent injury, loosens muscles before strenuous activity 
and helps cool the body down afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's a bit more complicated, for there are decidedly right and wrong 
ways to stretch. Many people, for instance, use stretching as a warm-up for 
exercise, but since one should never stretch a cold muscle, that's 
inappropriate. Rather, one should limber up for a few minutes -- jog gently in 
place, for instance -- to raise the body temperature, then stretch and move on 
to more strenuous exercise. 
</P>
<P>
And while many people stretch before exercise, fewer know the importance of 
stretching afterward. Stretching should be a vital part of the cool-down that 
ends a workout. It can help clear away byproducts that muscles create during 
exercise and prevent blood from pooling in exercised muscles. That will 
decrease, or even eliminate, muscle soreness. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically two kinds of stretches -- ballistic and static -- and the 
latter is preferable to the former. Ballistic stretching requires that you 
bounce and pulse as you stretch. That can be counterproductive because if you 
stretch a muscle too fast or too hard, it protects itself by contracting. This 
is precisely the opposite of the effect you want. Jerky motion can also cause 
exactly the sort of muscle tears that stretching is supposed to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
Static stretching, on the other hand, is slow, sustained stretching. You extend 
a muscle until it feels tight -- but not until it hurts -- and hold it for 15 
to 60 seconds. You'll have less risk of tissue trauma, use less energy and 
relieve, rather than cause, muscle soreness. Here's a good example of a static 
stretch: 
</P>
<P>
Sit with your torso lifted tall and your legs extended on the floor in front of 
you. Cross your left leg over the right one and bend your left knee so that the 
bottom of your left foot is on the floor. Pull your left thigh toward your 
torso by wrapping your right arm around it. Angle your torso toward your left 
leg and hold the position for about 30 seconds. Reverse your legs to stretch 
the right side in the same way.

SPORTS ANEMIA: IT'S AT LEAST 3 ELUSIVE AILMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. RONALD B. MACKENZIE, Dr. Ronald B. Mackenzie is a specialist in 
preventive and sports medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people exercise for health and an energy-boosting payoff. But if you feel 
like you're running on empty, you may be suffering from sports anemia. 
</P>
<P>
Sports anemia is a term loosely applied to a least three different conditions: 
hemodilution, iron deficiency anemia and foot-strike anemia. 
</P>
<P>
"A sizable fraction of athletes with sports anemia aren't truly anemic," says 
Russell Pate, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the University of 
South Carolina at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, anemia is a condition in which you have a reduced amount of 
hemoglobin or a low number of red blood cells. The most common symptoms of this 
disorder are fatigue, weakness and, in extreme cases, shortness of breath or 
palpitations, or you may have no symptoms at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Body Runs on Oxygen 
</P>
<P>
Hemoglobin is the substance inside red blood cells that transports oxygen from 
your lungs to the rest of your body. Your whole body, from bone to brain, runs 
on oxygen and active muscles require huge amounts of it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions called sports anemia is really not anemia at all, but 
more of a laboratory misdiagnosis. In fact, it most often occurs in people who 
are quite healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Hemodilution is a normal function of your body in response to the demands of 
heavy training. Elite athletes, particularly those in endurance sports, are the 
most likely candidates for hemodilution. 
</P>
<P>
Normal hemodilution happens when the body adds water to the blood and increases 
the plasma, the fluid part of the blood. The amount of formed elements -- 
erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells) and platelets -- 
stays the same. 
</P>
<P>
A laboratory test shows less hemoglobin per unit of blood, but it doesn't note 
the overall increase in blood volume. Your blood has the normal amount of 
hemoglobin, but more plasma, so you have fewer red blood cells per unit of 
volume. Because the amount of hemoglobin remains constant, hemodilution isn't 
an anemic condition and has none of the symptoms of one. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pate, an athlete has sports anemia when his or her hemoglobin 
concentration drops below 12 grams per deciliter. However, such levels of 
hemodilution may still be benign, he adds. Pate's research suggests that an 
athlete's performance could be affected by sports anemia, though results aren't 
conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of this condition remains unknown. However, one reasonable 
explanation, favored by most researchers, holds that hemodilution is related to 
your body's cooling mechanism. When you exercise, your body dumps water onto 
your skin in the form of perspiration. Your blood brings fluid to the skin's 
surface through the capillaries, tiny, semi-permeable vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In order to sweat, you have to lose water from your blood. A great loss of 
fluid would cause your blood to become too concentrated and sticky to flow 
easily through the capillaries. Your body prevents that problem by storing 
extra water in the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
Another condition known as sports anemia is iron deficiency anemia. Not 
exclusive to athletes, it occurs most often among women who may lose more iron 
each month when they menstruate than they take in. Your body's main use for 
iron is in making hemoglobin. Anemia caused by iron deficiency is relatively 
common, and a good physical exam should include a test for it. 
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency anemia develops in three stages, and you can live with a lack 
of iron without developing a true anemia. When your body is deprived of 
sufficient iron, it first begins to use iron stored in the liver, spleen and 
bone marrow to make hemoglobin. It then uses the iron that circulates in your 
blood serum. When these sources are depleted, your body stops making new 
hemoglobin. 
</P>
<P>
Some symptoms may develop even in the early phases, when only stored iron 
levels are affected. Certain iron-containing enzymes needed for oxygen 
metabolism and myoglobin -- an oxygen-storing substance in the muscles -- 
suffer first. Women with inadequate storage iron don't process lactic acid 
efficiently, and become tired more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter stages, your blood can't adequately carry oxygen from the lungs, 
and your oxygen-transport system breaks down. At this point, you suffer acute 
anemic symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Some athletes experience a little-understood condition that is related to 
trauma. In runners, it is called foot-strike anemia. The trauma of the heel 
repeatedly striking the ground ruptures red blood cells. This rare condition is 
poorly defined. It may occur at the same time as other forms of sports anemia, 
but is not directly related to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis Difficult 
</P>
<P>
When these different anemic conditions interact, diagnosis is difficult and the 
type of treatment less apparent. For instance, a distance runner may have a 
harmless case of hemodilution, which requires no treatment, coupled with 
iron-deficiency anemia. The only treatment for true anemia is iron 
supplementation, often with iron pills prescribed by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent anemia or treat milder cases of iron deficiency, a modified diet 
with more foods high in iron is best. Most premenopausal women can eat red 
meat, the best source of nutritional iron, without fear of raising their 
cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
Those with high cholesterol levels, and non-meat eaters, can consume 
iron-fortified cereals and iron-rich foods like spinach, broccoli, beans, 
lentils and tomato juice. Some women need more concentrated doses of iron than 
their diets can provide. In these cases, a vitamin-mineral supplement is a good 
source of extra iron.

JOB STRESS IS FACTOR IN HEART DISEASE, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SLOAN, Bill Sloan is a free-lance writer in Dallas. He wrote this story 
for the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This job's going to be the death of me yet." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you've heard those words coming from your own lips during some crisis at 
your place of employment. The fact is, most of us who work for a living 
probably voice similar sentiments at times. Often we say it jokingly, but for 
many American wage-earners, this oft-repeated statement may be dangerously 
close to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
While work-related stress is as old as civilization itself, the highly 
structured, highly technical, increasingly complex and often depersonalized 
workplace of the 1980s may be an especially stressful environment for many who 
deal with it every day. Now a growing body of medical evidence suggests that 
some jobs exact a potentially deadly toll. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contributing Factor 
</P>
<P>
The American Heart Assn. classifies stress as a contributing factor in the 
development of heart disease. While its impact isn't as significant as that of 
smoking, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, stress shouldn't be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
There is still much to be learned about job stress and its effects on the 
cardiovascular system, but a number of recent independent studies have turned 
up some surprising findings. 
</P>
<P>
* In their day-to-day jobs, police officers and firefighters face one crisis 
after another, as well as the ever-present threat of physical injury and even 
violent death. Consequently, it has often been assumed that police officers and 
firefighters are at greater risk of heart attack than almost any other type of 
worker. And yet two studies at the Veterans Administration Outpatient Clinic in 
Boston show that officers and firefighters actually have no greater incidence 
of coronary heart disease than the general public. 
</P>
<P>
* Bus drivers, on the other hand, are not so fortunate. Dr. S. Leonard Syme, an 
epidemiologist at UC Berkeley, along with David Ragland Ph.D., and Marilyn 
Winkelby Ph.D., studied 1,500 bus drivers in San Francisco. The researchers 
found that, compared to other groups of the same age, race and socioeconomic 
level, the bus drivers were 50% more likely to suffer from high blood pressure. 
They also discovered that newly hired bus drivers with normal blood pressure 
were likely to develop high blood pressure within 3 to 5 years. Similar studies 
of transit drivers in widely separated areas of the world confirmed the group's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
* People with highly monitored indoor jobs may also face an increased incidence 
of heart problems. A study conducted at the University of North Carolina by 
investigator Suzanne G. Haynes (Haynes is now at the National Cancer Institute 
in Bethesda, Md.), revealed that women telephone company workers using video 
display terminals reported a surprisingly high incidence of anginal chest pain, 
a symptom of coronary heart disease. Among VDT users, 15.2% reported angina, 
compared with 7.7% of the non-users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Rules Cited 
</P>
<P>
The highest rates of chest pain were found in women who, like the bus drivers, 
had jobs with high demand and low control. Their jobs involved dealing with 
complaint calls from telephone company customers and answering directory 
assistance calls. And the workers had strict rules about how to handle the 
calls. They were constantly monitored and were penalized if they didn't stick 
to the rules. 
</P>
<P>
* The hearts of women workers in general, however, seem less affected by 
job-related stress than those of their male co-workers. In the Framingham, 
Mass., Heart Study, Haynes found that women in the labor force have no greater 
incidence of heart disease than housewives, and that employed women still enjoy 
a significant survival advantage over employed men. In fact, women employed for 
the longest period of time seemed to have the lowest incidence of heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
* Two other unrelated studies yielded apparently conflicting results. Harvard 
Medical School researchers found that white-collar workers may be 30% less 
likely to die of a heart attack than blue-collar workers. But another report 
showed that administrative employees with management responsibilities are more 
likely to be disabled by heart disease than either blue-collar workers or such 
other professionals as lawyers, educators and entertainers. This research was 
done at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Stress as a risk factor is such a complicated issue that no one study can be 
expected to give us the answer. However, various studies are closing in on the 
problem of stress. Most authorities would agree that you are better off if you 
feel you have a "say" in how your job is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The level of job stress is frequently higher for people in positions with high 
psychological strain and low control, says Dr. Peter Schnall of Cornell 
University Medical College. Schnall heads a team of researchers who screened 
2,556 male workers in New York City, then picked 191 of the most "job-strained" 
-- all of whom had elevated blood pressures -- to study closely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Occupations 
</P>
<P>
Assembly-line workers, service workers, short-order cooks, waiters, clerical 
workers and teachers are among the occupational groups in which job strain is 
frequently found, Schnall says. All fit the high demand-low control pattern 
that produces stress and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, people may be able to perform highly demanding -- even 
dangerous -- jobs with no apparent ill effects. This may explain why officers, 
firefighters and such high-tension specialists as air traffic controllers have 
no higher incidence of cardiovascular problems than the average American. 
</P>
<P>
"Professional jobs that are high in demand but also high in control don't 
produce the same kind of strain that many workers in high demand-low control 
jobs encounter," Schnall says. "Our research suggests that (certain) jobs are 
stressful regardless of the personality of the individual who is in it." 
</P>
<P>
"As a worker, you need to have a way of participating in what you're doing and 
have some discretion in dealing with the demands of your job," says Syme, whose 
study of San Francisco bus drivers revealed that many drivers feel trapped and 
hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers are forced to work under the demands of a time schedule that is 
often impossible to meet, Syme explains. Yet many drivers attempt to stay on 
schedule by forfeiting lunch hours and rest breaks, knowing that supervisors 
will take note when drivers are late. Since most drivers have few other work 
skills and earn high salaries that would be hard to duplicate somewhere else, 
they try to protect their jobs at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stopping the Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"Expecting a worker to adjust to circumstances like these is asking a lot," 
Syme says. "Sometimes it's the system itself and the working environment it 
produces that needs to be changed. The Japanese system of worker input in the 
auto industry has proved its beneficial impact to the point that American 
companies are now beginning to adopt it. It's a case of stopping the pain at 
the source rather than just trying to help people adjust to the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility over fellow workers also appears to heighten the risk of 
job-related stress and resulting heart problems, according to Robert Brackbill, 
Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the NIOSH. 
</P>
<P>
Brackbill and other scientists studied 446,000 persons approved for Social 
Security disability payments from 1969 to 1976 and concluded that managers as 
an occupational group have the highest odds of being disabled by heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We found the common element to be some type of supervisory function and 
management responsibilities, whether the person is a factory foreman, a store 
manager or an office administrator," Brackbill notes. It may be no coincidence 
that this managerial class of employees includes many of the aggressive, 
hard-driving executives who typify so-called "Type A" behavior and who may be 
prime candidates for developing heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-year experiment with monkeys, Jay Kaplan, Ph.D., and his colleagues at 
Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., found that social 
turmoil produced a higher level of atherosclerosis, one type of "hardening of 
the arteries," in aggressive, dominant animals than in more submissive ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Groups of Five 
</P>
<P>
Monkeys normally live in groups of five, Kaplan says, with one monkey dominant 
in each group. The others form a "pecking order" based on strength and 
aggressiveness, with the weakest, least assertive monkey at the bottom. In the 
experiment, the groups were realigned monthly, and dominant monkeys were 
repeatedly thrown into conflict with other dominant monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
"Human behavior is certainly much more complex than that of monkeys," Kaplan 
says, "but I think there's an analogy between an aggressive monkey in a new 
social group and the type of aggressive mid-level executive who jumps from job 
to job in quest of more money, recognition and other rewards. Our conclusion is 
that there's potential for personality to interact with job situations in a way 
that could be dangerous. Job stress is only half the equation. The other half 
is the person's reaction to it." 
</P>
<P>
Few of us can afford to give up the jobs we have, of course -- no matter how 
stressful they may be. But we can adopt certain defenses against job strain and 
the health problems it can cause. Some of these include: 
</P>
<P>
* Valuing and enjoying one's work, and giving job satisfaction equal priority 
with such factors as salary and position. 
</P>
<P>
* Refusing to be ruled by unrealistic deadlines and demands. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking adequate time off for rest and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoiding confrontational, competitive situations whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
* Staying on amiable terms with fellow employees, regardless of whether they 
are superiors or subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to raise the consciousness of everybody, across the board, about the 
problem of job stress," Syme concludes. "One way to start reducing stress is to 
try to help the people who work with you. Another is to work with supervisors 
to encourage worker input and advice about work conditions."

MORE HORNS GIVE BIG SOUND TO WOODS BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KELLY GILBERT, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Woods has stood out as an improviser and experimenter ever since he was a 
sideman and soloist in the bands of Thelonious Monk and Oliver Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
So it should come as only a mild surprise that he has expanded his two-horn 
quintet into an ensemble he calls the Phil Woods Little Big Band on his new 
album, "Evolution" (Concord). 
</P>
<P>
Woods has been thinking about such a group for close to 5 years, going back to 
the time when he permanently added Tom Harrell's trumpet and fluegelhorn to his 
already-prospering quartet. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Woods spoke of adding another horn to expand yet again the colors 
of the music he was writing. Obviously pleased at having attracted Harrell, one 
of the top improvisational trumpeters in jazz, and pleased as well with the 
broader sound Harrell brought to the group, the leader wanted simply to carry 
the expansion thought a step further. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of one horn, though, he has added three: a tenor sax, a baritone and a 
trombone, played by Nelson Hill, Nick Brignola and Hal Crook, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
While Harrell takes a predictable center stage on Miles Davis' "Miles Ahead," 
the additional horns interact with his trumpet and Woods' alto to give the 
group a true big band sound in seven other songs here githout detracting from 
the tightness that longtime Phil Woods Quintet fans have come to appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet has not expanded permanently, just as its members -- Hal Galper, 
Bill Goodwin, Steve Goodwin and Harrell -- have not broken up despite 
occasional forays on other albums with other groups. They are merely exploring 
new ground. 
</P>
<P>
So it is here. The output, if only temporary, is truly orchestral and more than 
inviting. Such Woods originals as "Alvin G.," "Black Flag," "Rain Go Away" and 
"Which Way Is Uptown?" are full of polyphonic improvisations steeped in richer 
sounds than it's possible to concoct with a quintet. 
</P>
<P>
As if you couldn't guess that Woods would make it all work.

UCI WOMEN'S CENTER COUNTS ITS SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her youngest daughter had just been graduated from high school in 1980 when 
Carol Blanchard of Irvine decided to re-enter the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Newly separated after 23 years of marriage, the mother of two children figured 
the only option available to her was a return to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
But Blanchard wanted to do something else. 
</P>
<P>
So, like thousands of Orange County women before her and thousands after her, 
she turned to the Women's Opportunities Center at UC Irvine, an educational and 
personal-support organization designed for women entering the work force or 
changing careers. 
</P>
<P>
In the center's job-seekers workshop, Blanchard learned how to produce a resume 
that focused on her strengths and talents -- assets that included 20 years of 
volunteer fund-raising leadership and organizational work for community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to go out and do interviews in new areas of the work world," 
said Blanchard. She had interviews with the managers and account executives of 
hotels, insurance companies, a paper company and various city governments. 
</P>
<P>
Then she heard about an entry-level position as assistant director of 
development at Chapman College in Orange, a job in which she could tap the 
experience and contacts she had developed while doing volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard was hired and eventually promoted to director of development. She 
credits the Women's Opportunities Center for helping her make a successful 
mid-life career change. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me direction and confidence to go out and look for something different 
and bring out the best in myself," said Blanchard, who left Chapman College in 
August and is now doing consulting work for a national nonprofit organization 
and several local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
She also has returned to the Women's Opportunities Center, where she is taking 
a workshop for women in transition and another on career exploration. 
</P>
<P>
And, as a way of paying back the center for helping her, Blanchard is now using 
her fund-raising expertise as a volunteer on a committee planning a major 
benefit for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, scheduled for Oct. 19 at the UCI Bren Events Center, will honor and 
celebrate the accomplishments of nine Orange County women who either serve as 
role models or have created opportunities for women. 
</P>
<P>
The event is part of a major capital campaign the Women's Opportunities Center 
is launching to fund construction of a new 4,000-square-foot facility next to 
the Alumni House in the University Extension complex. In support of the 
project, University Extension has pledged $450,000, and UCI has allocated the 
land. To raise additional funds, the center will sponsor several fund-raising 
events throughout the year and is aiming for a ground-breaking ceremony next 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 19 years, the Women's Opportunities Center has served more than 
50,000 people. An average of 500 people a month participate in the center's 
vast array of workshops and counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
Success stories abound: 
</P>
<P>
There's Judy Howard of Costa Mesa, who took the center's Managerial Skills 
Certificate Program after staying at home to raise her children and is now 
director of an adult retirement village in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
There's Karen Packer, who went through the job-seekers clinic and used her many 
years of experience as a volunteer in Democratic politics to land a 
middle-management job at Edward's Laboratory in Irvine. She then went into 
advertising at Beckman Instruments in Fullerton and is now working in 
advertising in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
There's Kim Israelsky of Irvine, who was new to Orange County when she signed 
up for the job-seekers clinic. When she went out on the required informational 
interview -- the course requires participants to get their feet wet by meeting 
with an employer in a field they may be interested in -- Israelsky was hired on 
the spot by St. John Knits of Irvine. The company created a job for her selling 
a line of matching accessories. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the out-of-state woman, who was recently divorced from her doctor 
husband and living out of the family station wagon with her two young children 
when she entered the program. Given a scholarship to the job-seekers clinic, 
she landed a job as a medical technologist and later found similar work in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of operation, the center is not only still going strong, it 
is, as administrator and volunteer coordinator Gabrielle Hickling says, 
"bursting at the seams." 
</P>
<P>
Currently operating out of a cramped, 700-square-foot office in the University 
Extension building, the center must hold its workshops and classes in 
increasingly limited "borrowed space" at the university and in nearby churches 
and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
In a county rated as the 16th largest economy in the world and the fifth 
largest high-tech complex in the United States, center officials say the demand 
for career planning and job-training resources is burgeoning. 
</P>
<P>
"On one end of the spectrum we help keep women off of welfare, and on the other 
end we counsel women in top-management positions," said Elaine Hart, the 
center's executive director. "Once we have larger facilities, we'll immediately 
be able to triple the amount of clients we serve. We have the professional 
staff, and we have the clients. Our problem is we are limited by space only." 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the center has clients who come from as far away as Los Angeles, 
Riverside and San Diego counties. She said they also have received inquiries 
from around the country -- and even from Sweden -- requesting information on 
how to start a similar program. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Opportunities Center was formed in 1970 after the late Alice (Lou) 
Anderson, who was University Extension's program director for humanities, and 
Sylvia Lenhoff (now director of the university's Office of Relations With 
Schools and Colleges) noticed an increasing number of women returning to school 
and trying to enter the work force. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Sylvia and Lou felt these women needed support on the university campus 
as they were returning back to school much older than the average student," 
said Hart. "They also needed counseling about the kinds of classes that would 
give them the most direct route to what they wished to accomplish. And then, as 
they became successful in their studies, these women realized they needed 
career counseling as well."

Although the center's focus has always been on women, it is open to everyone. 
However, only 2% of the clients are men, most of whom come to the center for 
Career and Vocational Aptitude Testing, a 4-hour battery of tests that helps 
determine job suitability. 
</P>
<P>
The center is funded through membership fees ($25 a year), nominal fees charged 
for workshops and seminars, community donations and corporate grants. Since it 
is nonprofit, Hart said, fees are often reduced and waived at the request of 
clients in need. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which has no full-time staff members -- even Hart and Hickling work 
part time -- boasts a staff of 76 volunteer professionals from a variety of 
fields who run workshops, counsel clients and serve as support staff. 
</P>
<P>
The center offers counseling on all levels -- from career and educational 
awareness to the legal aspects of divorce, a course taught by Corona del Mar 
attorney Pat Herzog. "We're just really blessed with having a lot of community 
support from professionals who donate their services to us to help these 
people," said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Among several dozen workshop topics offered throughout the year are: 
self-esteem, self-awareness, assertion training, overcoming computer anxiety, 
exploring new career options, "Women Who Love Too Much" and "Do I Want a 
Divorce?" 
</P>
<P>
Two of the center's most popular offerings are the job-seekers clinic and the 
Managerial Skills Certificate Program, which Hart says helps women put 
themselves in "a position where they will be able to break through into more 
management type of responsibilities." The program requires taking six core 
classes offered through University Extension in addition to 26 Saturday classes 
dealing with practical issues of management taught by Joan Klubnik, a career 
specialist with TransAmerica Occidental Insurance Co. in Los Angeles. The next 
orientation meeting to explain the program will be held at the center from 6 to 
8 p.m. on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hart has become aware of an increasing number of working women 
who want to make career changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing some of those women we saw in the '70s who wanted to go back to 
school and get started in a career now wanting to change careers or go on into 
higher management positions," she said. "Working Women magazine says 52% of the 
work force now is women and only about 6% (of them) are top managers. We're 
working to help those women maximize their potential, to reach as high in their 
careers as possible. We do the same for men, but they don't seem to need us as 
much as women do. It's a new game for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the center has been really instrumental in Orange County in helping 
women to network successfully. Those who have made it are reaching down to the 
hands of their sister and helping her up the ladder, too." 
</P>
<P>
Hart, who started at the center as a volunteer in 1974 and has been executive 
director since 1983, said the feeling in the beginning was that the Women's 
Opportunities Center eventually would be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we had hoped -- that we would meet a temporary need -- but with 
the growing number of dual-career families and the high cost of living in this 
area, more and more women have to work," she said. "The need will always be 
there."

The new year started with a fiscal bang. In late December the State Board of 
Equalization released sales and use tax revenues -- more than $25 million of 
which stopped in Orange County cities. The county government was allocated $1.6 
million. Costa Mesa, Anaheim and Santa Ana received the largest dispersements. 
Costa Mesa had the largest per capita amount. Here's how each city fared 
(rendered in order of total allocation) followed by a five-county comparison, 
also based on total monies received:

Vehicles registered in Orange County draw about one-sixth of the complaints 
called in to the "smoking vehicle hot line" maintained by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. An analysis of 17,105 warning letters sent out by 
the AQMD based on calls received over the hot line -- 1 (800) CUTSMOG -- from 
April 1 to Oct. 15 found that the county ranked second even when population was 
taken into account. Los Angeles County produced by far the most calls and the 
highest ratio per 1,000 residents when compared to other counties in the El 
Monte-based district's service area. Within Orange County, Anaheim had the most 
cars drawing warning letters, but Orange had the highest ratio of the 10 cities 
with the most complaints. Buena Park scored the fewest letters of the top 10, 
but Irvine had the lowest ratio. 
</P>
<P>
When a caller reports a car, truck or bus emitting excessive smoke and provides 
enough information about the vehicle -- the license number, model, time and 
place it was spotted, etc. -- the AQMD sends a warning letter to the vehicle's 
owner. Starting Dec. 1, the air quality agency also began sending second 
notices to repeat offenders, warning them they could be subject to an 
investigation by the district that could lead to a $100 fine for violation of 
the California Vehicle Code.

Behind the mile-long breakwater at Dana Point Harbor, millions of dollars worth 
of privately owned boats are anchored at the 2,137 boat slips in the 
$24-million harbor that opened in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a wait to anchor a boat here, ranging from a year for a 24-foot 
slip that rents for $173 a month to 7 years for a 55-foot slip that rents for 
$485 a month. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, hundreds of people visit Dana Point Harbor, some straying to 
gaze at the affluent seashore residences. These sightseers soon will have 
another beautiful view when Lantern Bay Estates, a gate-guarded complex of 42 
multimillion-dollar homes built on the bluffs, is completed. The neighboring 
Lantern Bay Villa condominiums range from $350,000 to $750,000, with the prices 
steadily climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the west end of the harbor is the Orange County Marine Institute, a 
study and research marine facility that opened in January, 1981, which offers 
oceanographic classes. The institute houses two laboratory classrooms, 
aquariums and exhibits from the sea. An Ocean Adventure Camp is offered every 
summer to schoolchildren curious about marine life. Theater productions, 
children's programs and tours for the public are conducted continually on the 
Pilgrim, a tall ship owned by the institute and moored at the west end of the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-acre Doheny Beach State Park includes a broad beach off which people 
swim, fish, surf, jet ski and parasail. The beach, which has 115 campsites, is 
probably one of the busiest camping areas in California. The 5-acre picnic area 
is equipped with tables, fire rings, food and supply concessions. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1985, members of a group called Hole in the Fence began 
carrying small palm trees through a gap in the wire fence and planting them on 
the beach without the state's permission. More than 20 trees were planted 
before anyone realized what was going on, and when the trees were discovered, a 
minor dispute developed over whether private individuals can make improvements 
on publicly owned beaches. The dispute was resolved in favor of the Hole in the 
Fence gang, and today this little oasis has more than 100 trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Whale Festival at Dana Point Harbor will be held the weekends of 
Feb. 25-26, March 4-5 and March 11-12. People come from all over to watch the 
whales migrate from Alaska to Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen sheriff's deputies regularly patrol Dana Point Harbor, but during the 
peak season, officers from neighboring cities are occasionally called on for 
assistance. Despite the number of people who use the harbor, there were only 
two drownings in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although it exudes affluence, Dana Point Harbor offers plenty of entertainment 
for the not-so-affluent, children and senior citizens. It doesn't cost much to 
sit on a rock and gaze at the boats on the ocean, window shop in the many 
stores, smell the aromas emanating from the abundant restaurants and breathe 
the fresh air.

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: IN THIS CASE, BEAUTY IS IN TASTE OF BEHOLDER

Wes Jackson specializes in cooking dishes probably best reserved for blind 
tastings. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look so hot when they go in the oven -- or all that great when they 
come out, either," he says of the microwave desserts that have gained him some 
culinary note. 
</P>
<P>
"But they taste absolutely wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
So wonderful that two of his original recipes -- the hot fudge pudding cake he 
shared with Guys &amp; Galleys and an applesauce cake -- were finalists in the 
annual cook-off sponsored by the Times-Picayune paper in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 35 and a bachelor, lives in Laguna Niguel when he's not traveling the 
Western states in his role as an investigator for the security division of a 
nationwide women's specialty apparel company. 
</P>
<P>
He says that while he enjoys cooking a great variety of dishes, invariably it's 
the desserts he's asked to bring to a potluck. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a lot of experimenting with microwave cooking since I got my first 
one in 1981 and discovered that the cookbooks that come with the ovens are 
generally awful," he says. "The hot fudge pudding cake came about when I was 
fooling with different combinations of brown sugar and cocoa." 
</P>
<P>
And it's one dish that looks strange, indeed, when you pop it in the oven. 
After spreading in the basic ingredients, you sprinkle on the brown sugar and 
cocoa and pour hot water over the whole mixture -- creating a murky substance 
floating on top. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson suggests you look the other way and -- like the cook-off judges -- let 
your palate decide. 
</P>
<P>
He got into cooking while attending the University of North Carolina, from 
which he earned a degree in business administration. "It was a simple matter of

ASK THE VET: CAST IS NOT NECESSARILY THE ANSWER FOR LEG OF CAT HIT BY 
AUTOMOBILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Glenn Ericson, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

Q: About 4 months ago, our cat Squiggy was hit by a car. His left rear leg was 
broken just below the hip joint. We took him to a veterinarian, and we were 
told he would need surgery and a series of X-rays and treatment. The bill was 
going to be expensive, and we were unable to come up with any of the money 
needed to fix his leg, so we had him put to sleep. Recently, a friend of mine 
said that we could have simply had the leg put into a cast. Is my friend right? 
</P>
<P>
B. Bates, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A: Without seeing the X-rays and the condition of your cat after the injury, it 
is very difficult to comment on a surgical evaluation. However, if your cat did 
have a fracture of the femur or upper leg bone that joins at the hip, a cast 
would have been both impractical and improper. The basics of fracture repair 
require that the joint above -- the hip -- and the joint below -- the knee -- 
be stabilized from moving in order to allow the bone to heal properly. 
</P>
<P>
A cast would not be able to hold the cat's hip joint immobile and still allow 
the cat to urinate or defecate. Repair of femoral fracture requires surgical 
procedures, such as a pin inside the bone, a bone plate that is screwed into 
the bone, or a series of external pins that pass through the bone and are held 
rigid by a bar. There may have been some pelvic fractures or injuries that 
would also have prevented the use of a splint or cast. Admittedly, surgery is 
expensive but probably necessary in this case. I recommend that you talk to 
your veterinarian again just to satisfy yourself that everything was proper. I 
hope you decide to get a new pet. If you do, I suggest you consider veterinary 
pet insurance that is available to help with the costs of such unexpected and 
expensive injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am enclosing some "eggs" that are found here and there after our cat wakes 
up from her nap. I am most curious to know what they are, and I am hoping that 
you can identify them for me. 
</P>
<P>
Pam McMillan, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A: In the packet with your letter was a collection of tapeworm segments that 
have become dried and look like small grains of rice. The tapeworm, as it 
matures, will shed individual segments called proglottids, each of which 
contains the eggs of the tapeworm. These segments are mobile and will move 
about on your cat's coat and stool and into the environment, where they 
degenerate, making the eggs available for ingestion by flea larva. The larva 
develops into an infective flea, and if your cat accidently ingests one while 
grooming, she can reinfect herself with tapeworms. This is the major portion of 
the life cycle of the tapeworm. You need to have your cat treated for tapeworms 
and should also have her dipped or bathed for fleas to help reduce that 
exposure. Treating the house and yard for fleas will be necessary to reduce 
their populations and help prevent exposure to your cat. Your veterinarian will 
be able to advise you on the best methods for you and your cat.

40 AFTERSHOCKS RECORDED AFTER 5.0 QUAKE AT MALIBU ROCKS WIDE AREA; 4 INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 40 aftershocks were recorded early today in the wake of an earthquake 
that was centered in the Malibu area, causing minor damage and slightly 
injuring at least four people. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate quake, measuring 5 on the Richter scale, hit at 10:56 p.m. 
Wednesday. It was centered in Santa Monica Bay about 8 miles south of Malibu 
and was felt from San Diego County 100 miles south to Santa Barbara, about 100 
miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech seismic analyst Steve Bryant said 20 aftershocks were recorded before 1 
a.m. -- the largest measuring 3.3 on a composite seismographic scale. Since 1 
a.m., at least 20 more were registered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With a quake this size, we expect to see (aftershocks) for several days," 
Bryant said. "They should decrease after a while." 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5 is classified as "moderate," capable of causing minor 
damage if centered in an urban area. 
</P>
<P>
The quake shook office buildings 25 miles away in downtown Los Angeles with a 
rolling motion for 10 to 15 seconds, but was felt as a sharp jolt closer to the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, an early assessment showed only minor damage, sheriff's Lt. Jim 
Glazar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OC Arts Center Shaken 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, audible gasps and chatter rippled through the Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa during Wednesday night's earthquake, which struck during a 
particularly dramatic moment in a performance of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" by 
New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
As baritone Stephen Dickson was singing Papageno's solo in which he 
contemplates suicide, the 3,000-seat hall began to shake, and opera-goers 
whispered and shifted nervously until it subsided a few seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
"Right in the middle of the suicide solo -- what a way to go," a slightly 
jittery Dickson said after his performance. "Actually, earthquake never entered 
my mind. In this case, ignorance is bliss." 
</P>
<P>
No injuries or damage to the center were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The rolling temblor was felt in some areas throughout Orange County but 
generated no damage or reports of injury, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Calls Reported 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, a dispatcher said police felt the two-story station rock from 
the quake but have had no reports of damage or injury. The dispatcher, who said 
the intensity of the quake almost sent her diving under her communications 
console, said the department had not received any calls from people inquiring 
about the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, officials for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, fire agencies 
in north and west Orange County and other police agencies said they received 
only a handful of calls. 
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, the rumble sent rocks tumbling down from the mountainside onto the 
road through Malibu Canyon and toppled bottles and jars from shelves at a 
Hughes' Market, causing several thousand dollars damage to merchandise in the 
store, Manager Kelly Seidel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit real hard down here," Seidel said, noting that several shoppers in the 
store abandoned their shopping carts when the shaking started and ran outside. 
</P>
<P>
Glazar said the quake also pushed six cans and a bottle of beer onto the floor 
of the evidence locker of the Malibu sheriff's station, where they were being 
held for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"When the evidence custodian came in this morning, she found a big puddle of 
beer on the floor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, the quake shattered a 10-by-15-foot storefront window at a 
downtown J. C. Penney Co. and caused a few small cracks in the stucco at City 
Hall, police Lt. Roy McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals reported that four people were treated for cuts and other minor 
injuries, including a woman who broke her foot when she jumped out of bed, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water and Power said more than 90,000 people were momentarily 
without electricity because of automatic shutdowns of some equipment due to the 
quake.

RAIL TRAGEDY AVERTED IN BUENA PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Santa Fe Railroad employees pulled a woman and five children out of a car 
stopped on the railroad tracks in Buena Park this morning, just seconds before 
a passenger train crashed into the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Ruiz, 26, of Buena Park was driving her 1967 Chevrolet across the 
railroad tracks north on Dale Avenue about 8:30 a.m. when the train-crossing 
arms came down on the trunk of the car, Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For unknown reasons, Ruiz stopped her vehicle on the tracks and did not go 
forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe employees Joe Otero, 44, and Anthony Morales, 32, were working near 
the crossing and saw that a westbound Amtrak passenger train traveling about 55 
m.p.h. was about 100 yards away from colliding with the car. 
</P>
<P>
"They pulled the driver and five children from the vehicle just seconds before 
the collision," McMillen said. "The train demolished the car." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief inspection, the train continued on its route. There were no 
injuries.

U.S. MODIFIES LIBYA SANCTIONS TO PROTECT 5 FIRMS' OIL INTERESTS

<P>
The United States today modified its trade sanctions against Libya to help five 
U.S. oil companies protect their investments there. 
</P>
<P>
"The change will allow them to transfer operations to foreign subsidiaries or 
to operate their assets using third-country nationals," State Department 
spokesman Charles E. Redman said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The five companies affected are Conoco, Marathon, Amerada Hess, Occidental and 
W. R. Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. sanctions imposed on Libya in 1986, these firms were issued special 
licenses to negotiate "standstill agreements" with the Libyan government under 
which they would suspend their Libyan operations without being charged with 
default on their contracts until next June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Redman said, was that drilling continued with Libya collecting its 
own share and the profits that would otherwise have gone to the U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision . . . will eliminate the significant financial windfall which 
Libya has been receiving by marketing the U.S. oil companies' equity share of 
oil liftings," Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision does not represent a change of attitude of the U.S. government 
toward Libya. Our view remains unaltered. Libya still supports terrorism and 
subversion." 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Libyan tensions have mounted in recent weeks with Washington alleging that 
Tripoli has built a poison gas factory. 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. F-14 warplanes shot down two Libyan MIG-23s on Jan. 4. Washington said 
the Libyan planes were threatening the U.S. jets.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze unveiled a new step today in the 
disarmament process, announcing that tactical nuclear weapons would be removed 
from Eastern Europe, along with nearly 250,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to foreign ministers on the final day of a three-day endorsement of 
the recently concluded 35-nation Vienna conference on European security and 
human rights, Shevardnadze also promised that the Soviets would announce by the 
end of the month "data on the numbers of troops and armaments" of the Warsaw 
Pact. NATO welcomed the Soviet announcement but noted that the West already had 
significantly reduced its nuclear arsenal in Europe.

FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT, BUSH TELLS YOUTHS, BUT REAGAN'S SHOES WILL BE 'HARD TO 
FILL'

<P>
George Bush, on the eve of his inauguration as the nation's 41st President, 
spoke today of his optimism about the future but also expressed his feeling 
that President Reagan's "shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a group of top high school students that his mission is "to help 
build a better America," and he appealed for their help. 
</P>
<P>
The President-elect, who was to spend most of the day out of the public eye 
until his appearance at a nationally televised evening gala, said at a youth 
inaugural forum, "I really feel this: Our best days are yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
He also was to bid a private farewell today to the man who he said helped make 
it all possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be too easy," Bush said of what could be his final private moment 
with Reagan before taking the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
The students cheered when Bush said: "Our American optimism about the future is 
legendary and perhaps no one better personifies that than a President named 
Ronald Reagan, whose shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't predict all the twists and the turns that you'll see in your lives, 
nor can I as President prepare you for them, but this I do pledge: that I will 
do all in my power to help you to help yourselves prepare for a brighter 
future." 
</P>
<P>
He joked that "I certainly learned the importance of education during the 
campaign. I learned how vital it is to memorize dates -- Pearl Harbor day, for 
example." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to Bush's campaign gaffe in which he told an American 
Legion audience that the anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was 
Sept. 7. He quickly corrected himself to the actual day, Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
He made a new mix-up today, promising that his inaugural speech won't be too 
long and recalling that one President -- Benjamin Harrison, he said -- died 
from pneumonia after giving a very lengthy inaugural speech in bitterly cold 
weather. Actually, that President was William Henry Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush made his entrance to the stage, Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.) tripped on a 
step and had to be helped by Bush and an aide. "She will do anything to upstage 
the President-elect of the United States," Bush joked. 
</P>
<P>
But then he praised Martin, a longtime supporter, saying, "I'm proud to have 
her at my side, standing or falling."

DARMAN HITS 'WONDERLAND POLITICS' OF DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET NOMINEE SAYS HE WANTS TO END 'GAME' WHERE 'CUTS ARE INCREASES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, nominated as George Bush's budget director, told Congress 
today that he hopes to replace the "wonderland politics" that brought about 
huge federal budget deficits with realistic deficit reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, in prepared testimony for his Senate confirmation hearing, said it was 
essential that the federal deficit be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We must end the game of wonderland politics where cuts are increases and going 
down means going up," Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Darman said the 
President-elect does not plan to weasel out of his pledge not to raise taxes by 
calling a tax increase something else. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects Bush will abide by the "duck test" -- if it looks like a tax 
increase, it is a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "meant 'no new taxes' as it would ordinarily be understood by ordinary 
Americans and the duck test should be applied," Darman said. "If ordinary 
people think it is a tax increase, it is a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
He specifically included in Bush's "read-my-lips" pledge against tax increases 
a boost in the gasoline tax, higher levies on alcohol and tobacco, removal of 
home mortgage interest deductions and taxation of currently exempt employee 
fringe benefits like health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that Darman was opening the door to tax increases by some written 
answers to advance questions, several members of the committee questioned him 
about possible new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In his written responses Darman had said that under some circumstances a boost 
in taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and liquor could be viewed as "user fees." He 
had also suggested that higher taxes on Social Security benefits might be 
described as a "benefit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Calamity 
</P>
<P>
During the questioning today, Darman said that a serious economic calamity 
caused by the huge budget deficits might force him to recommend that Bush 
violate his pledge. 
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that he did not foresee such a recommendation, in large part 
because it is important that a new President not lose his credibility by 
reneging on a campaign promise. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how many years Bush's no-tax pledge was good for, Darman replied, "We 
might as well assume forever -- certainly for some extended period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Darman, the point man in Bush's battle to reduce the deficit, was widely 
praised by committee members for his government skills and is expected to win 
confirmation easily as director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
Darman is in many ways similar to David Stockman, President Reagan's first 
budget director. Both men have been described as brilliant political 
strategists, but they have also been accused by critics of being abrasive and 
intellectually arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
Darman's role as head of management and budget will put him more in the 
spotlight than he was during the Reagan years, when he served as one of the 
Administration's top behind-the-scenes strategists, first as a top White House 
aide and then as deputy Treasury secretary. In both posts, he worked closely 
with James A. Baker III, nominated by Bush to be secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Darman resigned from the No. 2 job at Treasury in April, 1987, to take a job 
with the investment banking division of Shearson Lehman Bros. He was lured back 
into politics last year when he joined the Bush campaign.

Consumer prices rose 4.4% in 1988, the same as a year earlier, as hefty, 
drought-induced increases for groceries offset stable energy prices, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
However, many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of the 
bad old days this year. They say tight labor markets and rising factory 
operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's 4.4% gain in the Labor Department's consumer price index matched 
the 1987 increase, which was the highest since 1981 but was four times the 1.1% 
rate in 1986, a 25-year low. 
</P>
<P>
A 0.3% rise in the index in December, which followed a 0.3% November increase, 
helped inflation finish the year at a moderate pace. 
</P>
<P>
The summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures, pushed food 
prices for the year up 5.2%, the steepest rise since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Energy for the year rose only a slight 0.5% after an 8.2% jump in 1987. Still, 
energy prices were far below levels before the 1986 oil glut, which pushed 
energy prices down 19.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of medical care, up 6.9%, also rose faster than the general inflation 
rate last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco prices posted one of the steepest rises of any sub-category, up 9.4% 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices rose 4.8% overall, with men's and boys' apparel up 6% and 
women's and girls' clothing up 3.4%.

A state Circuit Court judge today refused to block Tuesday's scheduled 
execution of triple killer Ted Bundy, who faces his fourth execution date. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Peach denied three claims in Bundy's appeal filed in the north 
Florida city where Bundy abducted his last victim. Columbia County State Atty. 
Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly 
Leach, said: "It's time . . . we're approaching the 11th anniversary of the 
death of Kimberly Leach, and Ted Bundy is still alive." Unless he wins a stay, 
the 42-year-old former law student will die in Florida's electric chair 
Tuesday.

TYSON READY TO UP HOLLY FARMS BID

<P>
A Tyson Foods official said today that the company is preparing to raise its 
bid for Holly Farms Corp. to $63 a share and that the deal is very close to 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Farms directors met in New York on Wednesday to consider takeover bids 
from the Springdale-based Tyson and from ConAgra of Omaha, Neb. Tyson 
previously offered $60 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't really put the stamp of approval on it yet," said Bob Justus, 
Tyson vice president for community relations. "There are little complications 
we think are sure to be ironed out." Meanwhile, a spokesman for Holly Farms in 
Memphis, Tenn., said, "As of 8:15 no decision has been made. And without a 
decision there is no announcement." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has more at stake than Tyson," said Leeam Lowin, a 
Greenwich, Conn., investor and former Holly Farms shareholder. "Chicken is 
their whole world. ConAgra is into other things. If there is no deal, Tyson 
would have the most likelihood of having troubled times in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Officials on all sides of the long-running battle for control of Holly Farms 
and leadership of the U.S. chicken industry declined comment Wednesday.

HOME CONSTRUCTION DROPS 8.2% IN 1988

<P>
Housing construction dropped 8.2% in 1988 to its lowest level in six years, the 
government reported today, but analysts said the industry remained in good 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of both single-family homes and apartments fell during 1988 to 
leave total housing starts at 1.49 million units. It was the poorest showing 
since the recession year of 1982, when 1.06 million units were built. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that despite the decline, which is likely to continue into the 
current year, 1988 was a good year for the housing industry because the level 
of construction remained relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not get very concerned when we're building over a million single-family 
homes a year," said Dale Stuard, president of the National Assn. of 
Homebuilders. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to get panicky about," he said. "It's a very controlled 
slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline had been expected because much of the pent-up demand 
for homes that developed during the recession was satisfied in subsequent boom 
years, and housing requirements are decreasing with the aging of the Baby Boom 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, mortgage interest rates are inching upward. Interest on fixed-rate 
mortgages reached 10.81% last week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said the 
housing industry "held up reasonably well, all things considered. Nonetheless, 
it is a decline and I think we'll see a little further decline in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986, when 1.81 million 
units were built, but then began sliding. Analysts believe further decreases 
are inevitable as interest rates continue to rise, the economic expansion runs 
its course and demographics take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go through the years toward the year 2000, we need fewer and fewer net 
additions to our stock of housing," said economist Richard Peach of the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. "We're just not creating as many new 
households as we used to." 
</P>
<P>
December's seasonally adjusted annual construction rate of 1.52 million units 
was down a moderate 2.2% from a month earlier.

SHAMROCK RAISES BID FOR POLAROID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrock Holdings, controlled by the Roy Disney family, today raised its bid 
for Polaroid Corp. by about $214 million to $2.61 billion and said it would 
wage a proxy contest for control of Polaroid's board. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based Shamrock's previous bid of $42 a share was due to expire today. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock said the new $45 a share it is now offering also applies to Polaroid's 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The ESOP, which holds about 9.7 million shares, 
or 14%, of the company's stock, is a key to Polaroid's defense plan, presumably 
because it puts a portion of the company in friendly hands. 
</P>
<P>
Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid has been steadfast in its campaign to remain 
independent, launching a restructuring plan which included a $300-million stock 
buyback. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid appeared to be winning its battle last week when a Delaware Chancery 
Court upheld the validity of Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
Delaware Court Judge Carolyn Berger said that she saw no evidence that the 
Polaroid employee stock plan was designed to entrench the management. She said 
that because the holders of the shares vote secretly, Polaroid management does 
not control the employee-owned shares. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, Shamrock said it intends to seek control of the Polaroid 
board at Polaroid's May 9 annual meeting in order to advance its takeover bid 
by installing its own board members.

FED, BANKS IN 9 OTHER COUNTRIES INTERVENE TO CHECK DOLLAR'S RISE

<P>
The Federal Reserve and central banks of nine other nations launched heavy, 
concerted intervention today to check the rise of the resurgent dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve and West German Bundesbank moved aggressively to check the 
dollar's new year rally after the currency closed Wednesday at 3 1/2-month 
highs against the West German mark and Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed intervened three times in an unusually firm response, dealers said, and 
the Bundesbank raised its two key interest rates to lure investors from the 
U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar dipped to 1.8670 marks from Wednesday's 1.8725 marks after the 
sell-off but continued to climb against the Japanese yen. The U.S. currency 
rose to 129.70 yen from 128.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank said it would raise its discount rate to 4% Friday and increase 
its key Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling on bank-to-bank lending, to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The moves were followed by matching rate hikes by France, Switzerland, the 
Netherlands and Austria, the second round of European rate increases in a 
month. The central banks of Britain, Canada, Italy and Belgium also sold 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar ignored the rate hikes but fell after the central 
banks' action, the third such coordinated round in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar responded only to such a concerted attack, dealers said, as high 
U.S. interest rates ()continue to underpin the currency. In addition, traders 
hope that President-elect Bush will soon tackle the massive U.S. budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"There still seems to be euphoria that in tomorrow's (inaugural) speech, Bush 
may say something about a big cut in the budget deficit," said Dan Holland of 
Discount Corp. 
</P>
<P>
On the gold market, February gold contracts rose 80 cents, trading at $404.00 
an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange.

FIRED COACH FILES RIGHTS SUIT AGAINST SCHOOL, NCAA

Gary Moss, fired as Sam Houston State basketball coach after the NCAA issued 
sanctions against him, has filed a lawsuit against school officials and others, 
including NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, filed here Wednesday, Moss claims that his constitutional 
rights were violated because a hearing on his firing was not held. 
</P>
<P>
In his second season at Sam Houston State, Moss was fired Jan. 7 after the NCAA 
sanctioned him for violations it said he committed while head coach at West 
Texas State. It was the first time penalties were levied against a coach no 
longer at the school. Moss coached the Buffaloes from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's committee on infractions ruled that WTSU illegally recruited players 
and provided them with free airplane travel, cash and use of telephone credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA placed Moss on three years' probation, banned him from postseason 
coaching this year and prohibited him from off-campus recruiting and speaking 
engagements during the 1989-90 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
WTSU was hit with three years' probation and a ban on postseason play this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Moss also asked District Judge Bill McAdams for a restraining 
order reinstating Moss' salary and other benefits as Sam Houston coach. He also 
requested that school officials not name a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the lawsuit were Sam Houston President Elliott T. Bowers, Athletic 
Director Ron Randleman, Vice President of Administration E. Rex Isham, state 
Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox, NCAA Director of Enforcement David Berst and Executive 
Director Schultz.

The Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to contract terms with shortstop Rafael Belliard

had a .981 average in 1980. Belliard batted .213 in 122 games with no homers 
and 11 runs batted in last season. 
</P>
<P>
Belliard is the second to sign of eight players who filed recently for 
arbitration. Third baseman Bobby Bonilla's signing was announced Wednesday.

Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mark Thurmond agreed to a one-year contract today, 
the team announced. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not announced. Thurmond had filed for arbitration 
Monday and was the only Oriole to file. The left-handed reliever was acquired 
by the Orioles during last year's spring training from the Detroit Tigers in 
exchange for third baseman Ray Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmond, 30, was 1-8 with a 4.58 earned run average in 43 games for the 
Orioles last season. His 2.97 ERA after the All-Star break was the Orioles' 
best. Thurmond's signing means the Orioles have avoided arbitration for the 
10th consecutive season. The last Oriole to complete the arbitration process 
was infielder Billy Smith in 1979.
