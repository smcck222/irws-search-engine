DEAN S. BUTLER, 69; ATTORNEY FOR NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dean S. Butler, the attorney who represented former President Richard M. Nixon 
in tax audits and other financial matters just before and after Nixon's 1974 
resignation from the presidency, died Wednesday in Whittier at the age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
His family did not disclose the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who practiced in Los Angeles but lived in Nixon's hometown of Whittier 
for nearly 40 years, was successful in arranging refinancing for Nixon's San 
Clemente estate, at a time after the resignation when the former President was 
in some financial difficulty. He also successfully represented Nixon against 
proposed state Bar disciplinary proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In a long career as both a lawyer and certified public accountant, Butler, who 
was born in South Dakota, also served as chairman of the executive committee of 
the California Bar Assn. and for a time was chairman of a tax reform commission 
named by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
He leaves his wife, Jean, a son, Bob, and two grandchildren. Services will be 
held at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Hillcrest Congregational Church in Whittier.

ANTONIO CIPOLLONE; FILED SUIT OVER WIFE'S SMOKING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEWARK, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antonio Cipollone, whose landmark lawsuit against three cigarette companies 
over his wife's death resulted in the first smoker-death jury award, died Jan. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
His death came five days after a federal appeals court threw out the $400,000 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported Thursday that Cipollone, 66, a retired Italian 
immigrant steel worker who had filed the suit as his wife was dying, was 
admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in Toms River, N.J., on Jan. 4, 
suffering from pneumonia and heart failure. He had undergone quadruple-bypass 
surgery in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem to concern him in the least," his second wife, Dorothy, said 
about the reversal of the judgment. "He never got up-tight about anything." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 5, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the judgment a Newark 
federal court jury had awarded him against Liggett Group Inc. The court, in a 
complex ruling, affirmed a U.S. District Court ruling that dismissed claims of 
Cipollone and his family that the cigarette companies had failed to issue 
warnings about the risks of tobacco smoking after 1965, when a federal labeling 
requirement took effect. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered a new trial, opening the door for new issues. In 
ordering the new trial the court said Cipollone had "live claims" against the 
three tobacco firms on grounds that they continued to market the product 
knowing the risks of cigarette smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Cipollone had been carrying on the lawsuit brought by him and his first wife, 
Rose, who died at age 58 of lung cancer in 1984 after smoking for 42 years. The 
lawsuit, first filed in 1983, named Liggett, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris 
Inc., which made the cigarettes Rose Cipollone smoked. 
</P>
<P>
"He was happy that he had gone through with whatever his wife Rose had started. 
He never had regrets," said Dorothy Cipollone. 
</P>
<P>
Cipollone's attorney, Marc Z. Edell, said the family was still deciding whether 
to continue the case. "My impression was, it was so much a part of Rose's life 
and Tony's life, they don't want to let it go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wall, an attorney for Liggett and Philip Morris, said, "We're very sad, 
and sorry, and do express our sympathy to the family." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was unclear what effect Cipollone's death would have on the case, 
which was being handled by Cipollone's lawyers on a contingency basis. 
</P>
<P>
Born in a village between Rome and Naples, Cipollone left Italy at age 15 with 
his mother and two sisters, and settled in New York City. He worked on 
construction jobs, with U.S. Steel from 1950 to 1979, and operated his own 
cable-splicing business from 1978 until his retirement in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, survivors include a son and two daughters from his 
marriage to Rose.

ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica has an official bird (the brown pelican) and an official plant 
(bougainvillea), but lawmakers aren't sure whether there's an official song. 
</P>
<P>
The shocking development came to light the other day when resident Lillian 
Abelson submitted her composition, "That Santa Monica Feeling," to the City 
Council, only to learn that five other city ditties also exist, including one 
dating back to 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Even Redondo Beach has a clear-cut song ("Redondo Beach for a Day or a 
Lifetime") to go along with its official bird (the Goodyear Blimp). 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the matter has been turned over to the Santa Monica Arts Commission's 
Henry Korn, who says a contest may be held to determine the winner. 
</P>
<P>
For a city that's famous worldwide, Santa Monica has been virtually ignored by 
pop composers. Residents probably don't get misty eyed over "You're the Reason 
God Made Oklahoma," even though it contains the lyric "Santa Monica Freeway 
sometimes makes a country girl blue-ooh-ooh-ooh. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Santa Monica, Reseda is the current subject of a tribute in song from 
Tom Petty, whose "Free Fallin' " offers the tender line: "It's a long day 
living in Reseda/ There's a freeway running through the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda native Bill Cartwright says he feels honored, except for one small 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no freeway in Reseda," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of yards, though. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump may yet build his tasteful 125-story smogscraper on Wilshire 
Boulevard. But his monument won't be constructed in time to be included in 
"American Highrise." 
</P>
<P>
The 8-foot-long mural by Richard Daniel Clark depicts the nation's best-known 
buildings, in shapes ranging from cylinders and pyramids to plain old 
rectangles. 
</P>
<P>
The artwork began as a doodle on a napkin a decade ago. "I was on a plane that 
was circling above Manhattan and I just started sketching the skyline," said 
Clark, a Canoga Park artist/writer who previously produced a live act called 
the "Traveling Gong Road Show." 
</P>
<P>
"Highrise" features a tiny, 28-story City Hall (crouching second from the left 
in the mural), the 73-story First Interstate World Center (at the right edge of 
the stars) and the Bonaventure Hotel (to the left of the Statue of Liberty). 
</P>
<P>
Clark's work is subtitled "Land of Man-Made Wonders." Among the wonders, by the 
way, is the fact that L.A.'s First Interstate stands taller than both the 
102-story Empire State Building and the 110-story twins in New York's World 
Trade Center. It's a shame there was no room to include L.A.'s best-known 
structure, the Tail-O-the-Pup emporium, which stands two buns high. 
</P>
<P>
Some people become nervous in a jury box. Jose Guzman sits there to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman, a court interpreter, meditates 20 minutes every morning and night. And, 
if he has a morning date, he'll show up early and climb into the box, as he did 
Friday in Division 55, Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Eyes closed, head tilted back, hands resting in his lap, he sat alone in the 
box, listening to a tape player through headphones. 
</P>
<P>
Meditation is necessary because his job is so stressful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendants are tense," he explained. "They have very nervous vibrations." 
</P>
<P>
Beware of congressmen bearing gifts? Lawmakers seem to be sensitive about their 
lack of credibility. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Rep. David Dreier (R-Covina) presented the Diamond Bar City 
Council with a 1-inch-by-1-inch chip that he himself removed from the Berlin 
Wall earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Just in case anyone doubted the authenticity of the chunk, Dreier added that he 
had a photo taken of himself chipping off the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he didn't have the photo with him. 
</P>
<P>
But he promised to mail it to the council. . . .

AIRPORT FRUIT SEIZURES EXCEED EXPECTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: AN AVERAGE OF 125 POUNDS OF FRUIT A DAY IS COLLECTED FROM PASSENGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agriculture inspectors stationed since last week at Burbank Airport 
have been confiscating an average of 125 pounds of fruit per day in the effort 
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly outbreak from spreading beyond Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than I expected," said Scott Sanner, one of six U.S. Department of 
Agriculture plant protection and quarantine officers assigned to the airport 
since Jan. 9. "I know the airlines are surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed officers are stationed at the airport's two security checkpoints and 
monitor X-ray screens for fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit found in carry-on luggage is confiscated and stored in blue containers to 
be taken to the department's El Monte office for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
No fruit fly larvae have been discovered to date in the confiscated fruit, 
Sanner said, but much of it is still being inspected. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is expected to continue until mid-summer, when the Medfly quarantine 
for the Burbank area is scheduled to end. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Airport was targeted because it is the only commercial airport in the 
quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
Other commercial airports might be affected if the quarantine boundaries are 
extended, said Don Wimmer, a regulatory supervisor for the department. 
</P>
<P>
Sanner said about 90% of the fruit is confiscated at the checkpoints, and the 
remainder is taken at ticket counters where passengers are sometimes asked to 
declare the contents of boxes or odd-shaped containers. 
</P>
<P>
Most fruit-carrying passengers have no more than one or two pieces, though 
inspector Jeff Smith said he removed 25 pounds of fruit from a single bag 
several days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Information tables and posters at the checkpoints warn passengers that they are 
in a quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
So far, inspectors said, public reaction to the inspections has been positive, 
though a few passengers grumble when their on-flight snack is snatched from 
their bags. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that disgusting or what?" asked Cathy Olson after an inspector removed an 
apple from her purse. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed at the Hyatt last night and I grabbed the apple from the dining room 
and put it in my purse. I forgot I had stolen it until they took it away from 
me today. I planned to eat it on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger, Janice Greene of Yuba City, said she approved of the 
crackdown but wished she could have kept the tomatoes on her sandwich, which an 
inspector delicately removed after spotting the slices on the X-ray screen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea," said Green, who was headed with her husband for a 
flight to Sacramento Friday after visiting her daughter in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The only trouble is that the tomatoes are slightly expensive. We went to 
Nate-N-Al's in Beverly Hills and paid 35 cents per slice. I threw away five 
slices."

PALMDALE ISSUES 30% OF COUNTY'S HOUSE PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rushing to beat new city fees, developers in fast-growing Palmdale obtained 
permits to build a record 6,747 houses in 1989, accounting for an estimated 30% 
of all house permits issued in Los Angeles County last year, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley city, with a population of just 55,000, by far issued the 
most new house permits of any of the county's 86 cities during 1989, according 
to figures provided by the city and a private industry group. The 1989 Palmdale 
tally exceeded the total of 6,674 for the previous three years combined. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said developers hurried to obtain permits before new fees of up 
to $6,000 per house took effect in September and October of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale City Administrator Robert Toone said the city is not having trouble 
keeping up with the boom. Toone said developers probably will hoard permits for 
a time and then spread them out over many months to not flood the housing 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see a phasing of that construction," Toone said, noting that 
house sales countywide have dropped in recent months. "Those houses are just 
not going to be built like they have been over the past 36 months," Toone said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6,747 new house permits last year represented a 130% increase over the 
city's 2,929 permits for 1988, city records showed. Nearly 3,600 of the permits 
were issued in the weeks before the new city fees began. 
</P>
<P>
Developers rushed to avoid a nearly five-fold increase in park fees that pushed 
the average to $2,106 per house. The city also added new traffic fees of $990 
and drainage fees of $1,093 to $3,121 per house. 
</P>
<P>
Toone estimated that the total city fees on a new house in Palmdale now average 
about $10,000, which he said is consistent with charges in other California 
cities. Most new houses in Palmdale sell for $130,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Construction Industry Research Board, an 
industry group that monitors development activity, Palmdale's permits accounted 
for about 30% of the nearly 21,800 issued countywide. Those figures, which were 
for the first 11 months of 1989, showed that the next closest cities were Los 
Angeles, with 2,325, and Lancaster with 2,314, said Ben Bartoletto, research 
director for the board. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lancaster had a year-end rush for permits that was not reflected in 
the board's numbers. That rush, spurred by a $957 per house traffic fee that 
took effect Jan. 1, should push Lancaster past Los Angeles in final rankings 
for the year.

PICUS LINKS WARNER PLAN, SOUTH AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE BUILDER OF THE WARNER RIDGE OFFICE PROJECT SAYS IT WILL 
GENERATE $4.5 MILLION FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy over the Warner Ridge project took new twists Friday as Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus accused one of the project's partners of 
doing business with South Africa, and the developer told a Pierce College group 
his project will generate $4.5 million for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily lobbied proposal to build half a dozen office towers -- ranging 
from three to seven stories, with 810,000 square feet of space -- at De Soto 
Avenue and Oxnard Street comes before the full council next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It's unclear what the outcome of the vote will be, City Hall watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, who is seeking to quash the project and force the rezoning of the 
property to permit only residential development, distributed a letter Friday to 
her council colleagues revealing that Johnson Wax Development, a 50% partner 
with the Spound Co. in the project, has a subsidiary in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said Johnson Wax's subsidiary is relevant to the Warner Ridge debate 
because of the council's longstanding opposition to South Africa's apartheid 
regime. The city has passed laws barring firms from receiving municipal 
contracts if they do business in South Africa and required the city's public 
employee pension funds to divest stocks or bonds in companies tied to South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Connection to firms doing business with South Africa has not been used in the 
past as grounds to deny building permits or zoning changes, however, a city 
Planning Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman told a reporter her letter was primarily aimed at the 
council's three black members and particularly at Councilman Robert Farrell, a 
South-Central Los Angeles lawmaker who is the sole member of the council's 
planning committee to support the proposed Warner Ridge development. The 
committee voted 2 to 1 to support Picus last month. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell is also a council leader on the issue of South African divestment. To 
counter Picus' move, the Warner Ridge team quickly dispatched black attorney 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to City Hall to meet with Farrell to explain the 
Johnson Wax situation. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Afriat, a lobbyist who represents developer Jack Spound, said Johnson Wax 
is "one of the most philanthropic and civil rights-minded corporations" and has 
the "highest record of working with anti-apartheid activists." Afriat said the 
billion-dollar corporation had even been asked by anti-apartheid activists in 
South Africa to remain in their country because it is a large and enlightened 
employer of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Spound caught his opponents by surprise Friday when he told a Pierce 
College panel that his project would -- if allowed to proceed -- contribute 
$4.5 million toward the construction of low-income housing in the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That came out of the blue," said Shirley Blessing, treasurer of the Woodland 
Hills Homeowners Organization. WHHO is Picus' major ally in the fight to kill 
the proposed Warner Ridge project. 
</P>
<P>
Afriat said the $4.5 million figure was based on an estimate of how much the 
Warner Ridge project would be required to pay into a city housing fund if the 
City Council passes a proposed law to require commercial development projects 
to pay fees into a fund to build low- and medium-priced housing. 
</P>
<P>
Spound brought up the $4.5-million housing fee Friday during a meeting of the 
Pierce College Planning Advisory Committee, held to give WHHO another 
opportunity to urge the college to change its position on the Warner Ridge 
project. The college opposes residential development on the property, next to 
college land, but is neutral on commercial development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing from both sides, the college panel stuck to its previous 
position. "It was disappointing," Blessing said.

THE FAT FACTOR AT A VERY YOUNG AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A line of research first suggested by autopsies conducted on Korean War 
casualties nearly 40 years ago has produced new evidence that the risk of heart 
disease in adulthood can begin in the habits of childhood. The brighter side of 
this gloomy news is that a lot can probably be done to postpone that risk by 
getting the young to be more careful about what they eat. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean War study made the surprising discovery that the arteries of most of 
the young Americans who were examined were streaked with fatty deposits. The 
bodies of Korean and Chinese soldiers, conversely, showed few signs of such 
lesions. This difference, attributed to the high levels of fat in the typical 
American diet, helped inspire decades of research into the relation between 
diet and coronary artery disease. Particularly intriguing was the evidence that 
atherosclerosis, the clogging of the arteries that in time can lead to heart 
attacks and strokes, may begin early in life and be fairly well established by 
the late teens or early 20s. Now, new research, presented at the American Heart 
Assn.'s annual science writers' forum, strongly supports that inference, and 
points to the value of preventive measures in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
The research, based on hundreds of autopsies on people between the ages of 15 
and 34 who died in accidents or by other violent means, uncovered a clear 
correlation between high blood levels of the LDL form cholesterol -- the 
so-called bad cholesterol -- and the first stages of atherosclerosis. Young 
people who had higher levels of the HDL form of cholesterol showed less 
evidence of atherosclerosis. In the older population a high level of HDL -- the 
"good" cholesterol -- is thought to be a sign of a healthier vascular system. 
</P>
<P>
The latest scientific findings were anticipated. As long ago as 1978, the 
American Heart Assn. proposed that saturated fats and cholesterol be limited in 
the diets of children after the age of 2 to retard the onset of heart disease. 
Last year the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines urging that in 
families with a history of heart disease or high blood cholesterol, children 2 
years and older should have their cholesterol levels tested with a view toward 
diet modification if readings are found to be high. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean, some researchers emphasize, that young children should be 
deprived of ice cream or otherwise forced to follow rigid low-fat diets. It 
does suggest that many parents would be doing their offspring a favor -- 
typically, one that won't be appreciated until much later in life -- by acting 
to reduce excess cholesterol and saturated fats in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
Heart disease remains, as it has been throughout this century, the nation's 
leading cause of death. Heart disease may not be wholly preventable. But in a 
great many cases it's certainly delayable, and the fruits of delay mean fewer 
premature deaths, more productive lives and the avoidance of large and often 
crippling medical expenses. The evidence is now more compelling than ever that 
the best time to start heading off premature heart disease may well be in early 
childhood.

NO MORE CANADIAN CHOO-CHOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They called it the world's most spectacular railroad journey, the 4,000-mile 
route across all of Canada, and undoubtedly it was -- especially the famed 
stretch of track through the Canadian Rockies. A century of history and 
tradition came to an end last weekend, however, when the jewel of that nation's 
railroad passenger system, the Canadian, made its final transcontinental 
journey. The Canadian is gone, and there is serious question about whether the 
network's other train routes will survive. 
</P>
<P>
In somewhat the same way the U.S. government had done, Canada formed its own 
rail passenger line, Via Rail, in 1977. But even with billions of dollars of 
investment, passenger ridership continued to decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Mary Williams Walsh this week quoted a former conductor as saying: 
"It appears to us that over the years they have deliberately tried to run down 
the train so far that people would say, 'The hell with it -- I'm going to 
drive.' " Sound familiar? That same barb was aimed at American railroads back 
in the 1960s as their owners attempted to dump unprofitable passenger runs. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the Mulroney government was giving up on the Canadian, Amtrak, the 
U.S. National Railroad Passenger Corp., reported that it collected record 
income of $1.3 billion last year. Ridership is at an all-time high. The 
California Zephyr, which runs between Chicago and San Francisco, with branch 
lines to Los Angeles and Seattle, is booked solid for weeks or months in 
advance during vacation periods. Amtrak has introduced nonstop express 
Metroliners in an effort to compete directly with airline shuttle service 
between New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration tried to do to Amtrak what Mulroney has 
done to Via Rail. Fortunately, Congress resisted and maintained the federal 
subsidy to the independent rail passenger corporation. The investment in new 
equipment and improved roadbeds has paid off handsomely. The federal subsidy 
now is lower than it was five years ago. Service is much better. Amtrak 
President W. Graham Claytor Jr. says the system might be able to cover all its 
operating costs by the turn of the century. No national rail system does that 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it never fully pays its way, Amtrak is a valuable national asset. As 
aging airports become ever more crowded and freeways more jammed, rail service 
will be an increasingly attractive transportation alternative for Americans, 
especially as technology brings about improved comfort, safety and speed. As 
Americans bid adieu to the Canadian, they look forward to even better train 
service in the United States.

LONG ARM OF KADAFI'S LAW, TOO?;

<P>
The Brezhnev Doctrine and the Cold War melted away in a rush, and the world 
wondered what new principle of international conduct would follow. To fill the 
doctrine gap, there emerged in late 1989 the principle of the Long Arm of the 
Law. 
</P>
<P>
There is dispute about who deserves credit for this invention. Conventionally, 
of course, the indictment of Gen. Manuel Noriega in Florida and the invasion of 
Panama are taken to be the founding extension of the Long Arm of the Law, for 
which President Bush is given credit. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue, however, that the precedent was set by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
when he condemned the British writer Salman Rushdie to death for committing 
blasphemy -- a crime, after all, under Iranian law. Purists retort that this 
death sentence amounted to overreaching; they grant that the Ayatollah would 
have been within his rights had he limited himself to sending a squad of 
soldiers to London to escort Rushdie to Tehran for a blasphemy trial. 
</P>
<P>
The doctrine began to assume its larger proportions on April 28, 1990, when a 
team of Libyan "marshals" was detained on arrival at Los Angeles Airport; on 
their arrest, the armed Libyans brandished subpoenas demanding that former 
President Ronald Reagan stand trial in Tripoli for the murder of Col. Moammar 
Kadafi's daughter during the U.S. bombing raid on Kadafi's tent in 1986. Kadafi 
was invoking Long Arm, which he smirkingly called the Bush Doctrine, and its 
Sauce-for-the-Goose Corollary, for which he claimed the sanction of 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
The White House promptly issued a statement pointing out that the Libyan 
indictment had not been properly drawn, and that, moreover, a statute of 
limitations applied to bombing raids and other acts of regrettable violence 
launched before Dec. 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The White House added that the choice of President James Monroe's birthday for 
Libya's act of war was an obvious provocation. Kadafi responded angrily that 
the well-known Sinatra Doctrine enabled every sovereign state to enforce its 
own law by its own long arm and that, in any event, the actual charge against 
Reagan was nothing more than involuntary manslaughter, for which the maximum 
penalty is only five years of tent arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi backed down and Washington relaxed -- until Beijing's India incursion of 
May 1, 1990, aiming to bring the Dalai Lama to trial on charges of 
destabilizing the Tibetan sector of China's sovereign territory. India resisted 
successfully, but the Chinese further offended the White House by invoking what 
they called the K'ang Hsi Doctrine after the Chinese emperor who had absorbed 
Tibet into China in 1720. To demonstrate its displeasure, the Administration 
announced its intention to disconnect all coffee-makers on American 
fighter-bombers leased to Beijing for a period of not less than 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, other nations extended their own long arms, thereby demonstrating that 
the United States was a genuine trend-setter in international law. First came 
the joint Zambia-Botswana-Namibia-Mozambique legion, which crossed the South 
African border aiming to seize the white leaders and bring them to war-ravaged 
Maputo for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Iranian feint into Soviet Azerbaijan, leading to a visit to the 
front by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, his seizure by a crack Iranian 
helicopter squad and his subsequent trial in Tehran on charges of being the 
Greatest Satan Around. 
</P>
<P>
The doctrine seemed to have gone too far when Swedish troops parachuted into 
Jerusalem in search of Israelis who had assassinated the United Nations 
mediator Count Folke Bernadotte in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
It was at this point that dissension surfaced in Washington. State Department 
moderates proposed to revise the Long Arm of the Law Doctrine to read: Troops 
can legitimately be dispatched to another nation only to lay hands on a brutal 
dictator formerly on the payroll of the nation doing the dispatching. But this 
trial balloon was shot down when neo-Brezhnevites in Moscow were heard to 
menacingly suggest that the Red Army would have been within its rights had it, 
at the time of the Czechoslovakia invasion in 1968, also invaded Romania. 
</P>
<P>
New television shows went into global syndication: "Unindicted 
Co-Conspirators!," "L.A. Long Arm," "Peoples' Marshals." "Meaningful Pursuits" 
became the party game of choice and buttons circulated around the world in 12 
languages, saying "I Am Not a Wimp."

AN HONORABLE CHOICE FOR BARRY; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: HIS POLITICAL CAREER MAY BE CRIPPLED, BUT THE MAYOR COULD STILL 
LEND AN IMPORTANT HAND TO DEFEATING DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, facing federal narcotics charges after 
being caught in an FBI "sting," must now be wondering about his political 
future. I do not wish to prejudge the charges against him, but assuming they 
are true -- assuming also that he has a substance-abuse problem of some 
duration -- I have some advice for him. Instead of going forward with his 
planned announcement of his reelection bid, he might consider making a speech 
along the following lines: 
</P>
<P>
Friends, supporters and fellow citizens of the District of Columbia: As you 
know, I had planned to come before you today to announce my candidacy for 
reelection as your mayor. But for reasons well known to all of you, I must give 
you a different message. 
</P>
<P>
For those of you who are impatient, the bottom line is that I will not run 
again at this time. For those of you who care to listen, I want to tell you 
why. 
</P>
<P>
I have a problem. I don't need to discuss the details of that problem, except 
to say that it is a problem that I can no longer handle alone. I thought I 
could. I thought I was strong, and I am. I thought I was smart, and I still 
think I have more intelligence than my enemies give me credit for. I thought I 
was invincible. I am not. That is why I have decided to relinquish my duties to 
my city administrator and seek professional help. 
</P>
<P>
You ask me why I have waited so long to acknowledge that I need help, and the 
answer is that denial is part of the problem with my particular ailment. At 
first I denied it because I honestly believed there was no problem. Then I 
denied it because I thought I was strong enough to handle it on my own. And 
finally I denied it because to own up to it would have meant giving up my 
political career and also giving satisfaction to my enemies. 
</P>
<P>
I'm here today to tell you that these things no longer matter. What matters is 
that I do what is necessary to restore myself to health and vigor and that my 
city not be dragged down. 
</P>
<P>
I did not reach this decision easily. Many of you have shown your willingness 
not to believe the rumors about me in the absence of proof. Others have 
determined to stand by me, even while believing the rumors, because you didn't 
want to play into the hands of people who don't have our best interests at 
heart. It had been my idea to use that support for my own political purposes, 
to make the mayoral race an us-against-them campaign. Such a tactic might have 
succeeded. It still might. But I have decided not to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Why? For at least three reasons. First, my recent difficulties, added to the 
rumors and innuendo that have surrounded me in the last year, make it 
impossible for me to give full time and attention to my duties as mayor. 
Second, a number of my friends have convinced me that while they think I could 
tough it out, it is not in my interest to do so. They have convinced me that my 
personal health is more important than my political career. 
</P>
<P>
The third reason is that I have become convinced that the only way for me to 
win reelection would be to divide this city along the lines of race and class. 
Some of my enemies won't believe this, but I care about Washington and its 
social and economic health more than I care about being mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the amateur psychiatrists out there are saying that I really wanted to 
get caught, because it was the only way I could get the help I need. They are 
saying that is why I lived dangerously, why I associated with some of the 
people I associated with. They may be right, but I don't believe it. What I 
believe is that I simply got caught up in something that I could not control. 
</P>
<P>
I am now determined to regain control of my life, and I will seek the help 
necessary to do that. Marion Barry, the mayor, is up to history to judge. I 
believe that judgment will be favorable. I have been a good mayor. I have 
brought economic development to the District of Columbia, and I have given hope 
to its hopeless citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever history's judgment of Marion Barry the mayor, I must now turn my 
attention to Marion Barry the man. My health, my self-respect and my family are 
now at the top of my agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Let me close my remarks with a word to the young people of this city. I know 
you think that you are stronger than drugs, that you can handle it. That is 
exactly what I thought. I thought I was strong; I thought I was powerful. I 
thought my personal strength and my high office would somehow protect me and 
help me to defeat the drugs that are doing so much damage to our city and our 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Well, let me tell you, based on personal experience, that the only way you can 
defeat drugs is to leave them alone. Use my experience for your own lives. Draw 
strength from my successes; learn humility from my failures, pray for me, and 
be the best you can be.

STUART MURDER IN BOSTON AND RACISM IN U.S.

Is it any wonder that so many people hold the news media in such low regard? 
The "black suspect in Boston" episode is another example of how the media might 
have helped to alleviate tensions, but instead aggravated them.

Responsibility -- 0.

STUART MURDER IN BOSTON AND RACISM IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was thrilled to read the account in the Jan. 14 issue (View) describing the 
accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in winning victory 
after victory for black people and the Constitution over the forces of hate and 
bigotry. All Americans should be proud of the work that Marshall has done to 
make this a freer and more democratic country. 
</P>
<P>
Then I read Jackson's column. I am saddened at what the fight against racism 
has degenerated into. Currently, an epidemic of drug use is threatening black 
Americans as white racists never could. Does Jackson urge greater action to 
combat the scourge of drugs? He does not. 167772161 Instead, he sticks his head 
in the sand and says that drug addiction is primarily a white problem, and 
calls for less effort to combat drugs in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is doing an extreme disservice to his own people. Were a white person 
to advocate lessening protection of black people from drugs, he or she would be 
denounced as a racist. Perhaps Jackson is afraid of encouraging prejudice if he 
acknowledges the extent of the damage that drugs have made on the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Jackson to support vigorous action to combat drugs and crime in all of 
America. By opposing efforts in the black community to combat drugs, Jackson is 
giving aid and comfort to those who would destroy the black community.

CONTROVERSY OVER WOMEN IN COMBAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women in combat -- they have to be kidding. So Mrs. (President) Bush is all for 
having the gals go to combat, too (Part A, Jan. 17). 
</P>
<P>
Since when has "combat" become so coveted? Oh, sure, these little phony wars 
like Grenada and Panama look like real fun things. You just go in there and 
shoot up a few scared natives, then fall back in to receive your medals and 
promotions. And those gals do look cute on the telly all dressed up like the 
boy soldiers. Maybe they think they should have those glamorous jobs like 
fighter or gunship pilots. 
</P>
<P>
How do you think they would fit into Oliver Stone's Vietnam "Platoon," or that 
tank platoon I had in Nam? The only showers there were outdoors, and we had 
those same four-hole type outhouses they showed in the movie. That was the 
"uptown" part. In the field we went skinny dipping in the South China Sea, or 
later, just stripped in front of the tank and took a "sponge" bath. (It didn't 
seem to bother the natives to see a naked GI.) 
</P>
<P>
This women's lib thing is the biggest con job of the century.

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL'S PILOT PROJECT TO RECYCLE WASTEPAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the sponsor of the City Hall pilot recycled paper program, we feel compelled 
to correct the many misstatements of fact in your article ("China Recycling 
Program a Paper Tiger," Metro, Dec. 3) and to affirm the excellent efforts of 
both the City of Los Angeles General Services Department and the city employees 
in making this project successful. 
</P>
<P>
This 6-month pilot was funded at considerable expense entirely by China Paper 
Partners. It tested a unique concept of separating, collecting and recycling 
mixed paper and represented the first phase of a project to build a de-inking 
pulp mill in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
The intent was to finish the feasibility study in June, break ground in August, 
and be able to ship Los Angeles wastepaper to the mill when it was finished. 
Unfortunately, the difficulty in relying on foreign markets for recycling that 
the United States should be undertaking itself was dramatically underscored by 
last summer's political events in China. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Los Angeles made a good faith commitment to explore an innovative 
and needed means of recycling mixed paper. Neither party walked away from the 
program. I would like to correct several points: 
</P>
<P>
1. Conservatree Paper Co. and China Paper partners did not "lose interest in" 
or "abandon" the program in the spring of 1989. Mayor Tom Bradley notified 
employees about the program by letter in late February. 
</P>
<P>
Several meetings were conducted with the entire custodial services staff in 
April and May. China Paper Partners launched a follow-up employee education 
campaign throughout City Hall in early May, 1989, with a second letter of 
instruction from the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, practically every 
employee work station in City Hall was visited, with program materials 
distributed and program operations explained on a one-to-one basis. This was 
supplemented by decals on all recycling and refuse bins, as well as posters in 
every elevator lobby. 
</P>
<P>
2. City's Hall's existing white paper and newspaper recycling programs were 
never discontinued. Rather, our mixed paper recycling program was added to the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
3. China Paper Partners was not in the business of buying and selling 
wastepaper. This would occur only if the pilot project succeeded and a mill 
were established in China. 
</P>
<P>
4. The collection program resulted in more than two-thirds of the waste stream 
being collected for recycling from both Transamerica and City Hall, more than 
twice the collection rate of programs previously judged successful. 
</P>
<P>
China Paper partners briefed the mayor's office, the General Services 
Department, and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office, as well as your newspaper, 
in October and November regarding the status of the program and the uncertainty 
of the situation in China. 
</P>
<P>
Innovative ventures such as this are complex, particularly when international 
political and business interests are mixed. The Chinese government remains 
deeply interested in this project. 
</P>
<P>
It is only after our November visit to China and time to review the complicated 
situation with planned investing institutions that we have had the information 
necessary to determine the next steps. Unfortunately, this includes the 
realization that our ability to proceed in China will be delayed. Therefore, we 
have laid the groundwork to extend the program to other countries, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the current political problems hampering the program in China, we 
remain deeply committed to designing and implementing environmentally sound and 
effective business solutions to a serious environmental problem.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-PARKS WORKER GETS 3 YEARS FOR MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former city employee at Reseda Park was sentenced to three years imprisonment 
Friday for molesting a 6-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Lars Juden, 38, who coached young people in athletics at the park since 1983, 
pleaded guilty Friday to child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped a second child molestation 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Juden and another man, Ronald Ray Rudd, a 39-year-old volunteer at the park, 
molested the boy last July and August in the park office and in a van across 
the street. They were arrested in August, and Juden was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz could have sentenced Juden to 
up to eight years in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R. Abele. But 
Abele said he was "quite satisfied" with Juden's sentence because the guilty 
plea saved the boy the pain of having to take the stand. Juden has no prior 
convictions for child molestation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudd, who admitted that he has twice before been convicted of child 
molestation, was sentenced in September to 15 years in prison after he pleaded 
guilty to three counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
At Juden's preliminary hearing, Los Angeles police Detective Joseph Diglio 
quoted Juden as saying, "If the kid didn't come to the park alone, these things 
wouldn't happen."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2-YEAR COLLEGE INSTALLS CONDOM DISPENSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an AIDS prevention effort, Antelope Valley College in Lancaster 
installed its first two condom dispensing machines in student restrooms Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The machines were installed in the men's and women's restrooms in the campus 
student center at the recommendation of a health and safety committee composed 
of college officials and students. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there's many other colleges that have beat us to the punch on this 
one," said Steve Standerfer, a spokesman for the two-year college. He said 
UCLA, UC Riverside and community colleges in Glendale, San Bernardino and 
Fresno are among those that already have the machines. 
</P>
<P>
The college, which has about 8,600 students, plans to use any profits to pay 
for AIDS and sex-related programs on campus, Standerfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the college has not had any controversy or protests about the 
dispensers, Standerfer said.

A California City man has been arrested in the stabbing of a 17-year-old

after refusing to tell them what school he attended.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies from the gang detail of the Antelope 
Valley station arrested Clifford Pinkney, 22, after sighting him Thursday 
afternoon at a pay phone in Antelope Valley Municipal Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkney was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and is being 
held on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkney named the three other assailants, who are still being sought, deputies 
said. All four are members of a gang based in Quartz Hill, deputies said, and 
are alleged to have stabbed the 17-year-old with a knife and a screwdriver 
after accosting him on Gadsden Avenue in Lancaster and demanding that he tell 
them what school he attends. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was treated for wounds in the leg and torso and released. Members of 
the same gang are also believed to have played a role in the shooting death two 
weeks ago of an Antelope Valley high school athlete, deputies said.

SUPREME COURT REJECTS APPEAL OF DENTAL RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court in San Francisco dealt a setback this week to an 
experimental program, administered through Cal State Northridge, that allowed 
some dental hygienists to work without the supervision of dentists. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's decision left in place a ruling by the 3rd Circuit Court of 
Appeal in Sacramento last year that the pilot project was illegally expanded 
and should be halted. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, dental hygienists must be supervised by a dentist. Under the 
Health Management Pilot Program begun in 1981, 15 dental hygienists in Reseda 
were allowed to work without supervision. Dentists were to make random 
examinations on and calls to patients as a check on their work. 
</P>
<P>
The program was expanded to several sites in 1986 and was monitored by two 
dentists visiting the sites every two months. 
</P>
<P>
The California Dental Assn. filed suit the next year, arguing that hygienists 
are not educated to diagnose dental diseases or serve as primary health-care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal ruled that the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development exceeded its authority by approving the expanded program. The court 
said the changes made in 1986 effectively created a new project that required 
the state to hold public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Many hygienists battled to save the project, saying they relied on the 
program's continued existence when they spent from $25,000 to $45,000 to set up 
independent offices. 
</P>
<P>
The state health planning office and a group of hygienists appealed the 
decision to the California Supreme Court, which on Wednesday refused to hear 
the appeal, sending the case back to Sacramento Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Paul A. Lombardo, attorney for the dental association, said the Superior Court 
should immediately implement an order by the Court of Appeal to order the state 
to halt the program. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Perry, assistant director of the health planning office, said there is 
still a chance the project will survive, perhaps in an altered form. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Theodore Garelis said the program is still in operation until 
the Superior Court acts. He said the next step is up to the hygienists, who 
will have to request new hearings and reapproval for the program.

49ER FANS GET LAST LAUGH AT COLUMNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to express my thanks to Mike Downey for giving all the Southland 
49er fans a team to root for in the AFC title game as well. Mr. Downey's 
baseless column picking the Rams and the Browns in Super Bowl XXIV so 
thoroughly incensed my fellow Niner supporters that we found ourselves pulling 
for the Broncos in the entirely meaningless AFC championship, simply to prove 
Mr. Downey an incompetent prognosticator. I get the feeling that Mr. Downey, 
perhaps rethinking his predictions, requested the Denver assignment on Sunday 
so as to avoid directly facing the music on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks again; perhaps he would do all the 49er fans an additional favor by 
making the Broncos his Super Bowl pick.

<TEXT>
<P>
30-3! Well, I guess Bob Oates was only half right in his column of Jan. 4. The 
Rams did win in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
However, they never stood a chance against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
In his column, Oates just about handed the Rams the Super Bowl trophy, but he 
forgot that the Rams' inside track led through San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, the Rams may have read Oates' column and thought that all they 
had to do was show up to beat the 49ers. Physically, the Vikings barely touched 
Joe Montana, and neither the Vikings nor the Rams recorded a sack against the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, and especially Jim Everett, had a great season, but Oates' column 
read better as fiction.

At long last, the Clippers are on their way. For too long the stepchild and

Will attendance go up? Will they have to tear down the Sports Arena and build a

FOREMAN VS. TYSON HAS DEADLY POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm still not impressed. George Foreman, boxing blob that he is, has yet to 
fight anyone that wasn't over the hill, overweight, overrated or simply a 
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his quick KO of an aging Ken Norton, and the best low blow of the 
century (Hello, Larry!), Gerry Cooney's only claim to fame is that he is big 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
Before Foreman gets a shot at Mike Tyson, investigate. Then, if he's cleared, 
make Foreman fight a real boxer. Somebody in the top 10, and I don't mean age 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, let Foreman and Tyson go at it. And give the bloodthirsty public what 
it really wants to see. 
</P>
<P>
A death in the ring.

HOORAY FOR THOSE WHO AMBUSH DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the front-page article, "South for the Winter," on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Although I must admit that I have never experienced the thrilling sport of 
ambushing ducks from behind the bushes, I look up to macho-men like Mr. 
Missildine with sheer awe. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it takes a special kind of person to blast more than 2,000 birds in 
two days, just as it takes a special kind of newspaper to feature these types 
of American heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next week you can do an article on blinding deer with high-powered 
lights, then blasting them with semiautomatic rifles. How about chasing 
raccoons up trees with a pack of dogs and shooting them out of the branches? 
Whatever article it is, I can only hope it measures up to the standards 
established by your detailed profile of those who blow ducks out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, cancel my subscription.

BRING BACK FTOREK TO REPLACE WEBSTER

Is Tom Webster too nice a guy? Is it too late to reinstate ex-King coach Robbie 
Ftorek? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Kings appeared to unarguably get the best of the Gretzky trade. 
This year, with the Oilers leading the NHL and the Kings sinking in the West, 
we're not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Gretzky is a great player and we fans love him. But, turmoil or not, 
isn't the goal to get a Stanley Cup championship? Mr. Vachon, won't you please 
bring back the man in the sweater? Or do you need Mr. Gretzky's permission 
first?

<TEXT>
<P>
Something tells me that Jim Murray was eating quiche as the 49ers kicked the 
Rams' butts. 
</P>
<P>
Like Murray's over-extended metaphors, the myth of the 49ers as a finesse team 
doesn't seem to fade for those sheltered ones who never see them play. Murray 
seems intent on coming up with a clever premise as a replacement for the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if he started paying close attention to the thing he is purportedly 
writing about, his jokes would have more basis in truth, always the best source 
for humor as well as rational thought.

Now that the Rams have been eliminated, I anticipate that the fickle among the 
Los Angeles "faithful" will be raising a clamor that the Rams, Jim Everett and 
John Robinson are (A) losers and (B) chokers. 
</P>
<P>
I would respond that the basic purpose of professional sports is to entertain. 
The Rams delivered the goods in terms of entertainment. The elation that I felt 
as a result of their regular-season victories and their two playoff wins surely 
outweighs the final disappointment. The moral? Sometimes it's just as good to 
win a lot of battles as it is to win the war. Thank you, Rams, for a memorable 
season.

GRANADA HILLS WINS IN 2 OVERTIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the ingredients were there. Fervent fans trading taunt for taunt across the 
gymnasium at one another. Rival cheerleaders matching leaping routine for 
leaping routine. Several near-melees between students during the game and 
another afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in a double-overtime white-knuckler, and what have you got? 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy-Granada Hills high school rivalry, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Granada Hills, the basketball more than matched the hoopla as 
the Highlanders defeated Kennedy, 77-73, in double overtime in a North Valley 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great game for a spectator," a disconsolate Kennedy Coach Yutaka 
Shimizu said. "I've been through a lot of these." 
</P>
<P>
None more hotly contested than this one. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (10-7, 3-2 in league play) looked like a sure winner when the 
Highlanders' Jermoine Brantley, not realizing that his team was out of 
timeouts, called one with nine seconds to play and the score tied, 62-62. A 
technical foul was assessed, and Kennedy's Juan Segura hit the second of two 
free throws to give the Golden Cougars a 63-62 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy also got the ball out of bounds, and Garret Anderson (a game-high 36 
points and 10 rebounds) increased the lead to 65-62 by sinking two free throws 
with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley (30 points, five steals) redeemed himself by hitting a long 
three-point shot with two seconds remaining, sending the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley scored four points in the first overtime, including a short jump shot 
that gave Granada Hills (13-7, 4-1) a 71-69 lead with less than 30 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
But Brantley and teammate Aaron Lattimore (14 points, 10 rebounds) both missed 
the front end of one-and-one situations in the final seconds and Anderson, who 
scored all six Kennedy points in the first overtime, sank an 18-foot shot at 
the buzzer to send the game into a second three-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy failed to score another basket. Brantley put Granada Hills ahead for 
good, 75-73, with his third three-point shot of the game, and reserve forward 
Jevon Lee sank two free throws with 13 seconds left to clinch the win. 
</P>
<P>
"Brantley's our guy. We kind of live and die by him," Granada Hills Coach Bob 
Johnson said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CLU SETS RECORD IN 127-42 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran set a school record for margin of victory by demolishing Life 
Bible, 127-42, in a men's nonconference basketball game Friday evening at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
The 85-point margin of victory broke the previous record margin of 61 points, 
which Cal Lutheran had achieved twice. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Cal Lutheran beat Life Bible, 118-57, and in 1975, the Kingsmen 
thumped Simpson College, 113-52. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran shot 59% from the field, and Coach Mike Dunlap went to his bench 
early. Five reserves scored in double figures for Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Reserves Wayne Dominick, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds, Syd Thwaites (17 
points), Rob Caulfield (16 points and seven steals), Marcus Littlejohn (16 
points and 11 rebounds) and Mike Wise (11 points and six steals) all flourished 
with extended playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Starters Jeff deLaveaga and Mike Demeter scored 20 and 10 points for Cal 
Lutheran (3-15). 
</P>
<P>
Life Bible (6-7) was led by John Spinelli with 20 points, but the team made 
only 11 of 56 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 50, Cal State Dominguez Hills 43 -- Julie Arlotto scored 
12 points, Sandi Olson added 11 and Denna Mulverhill grabbed 10 rebounds as the 
Lady Matadors posted a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. win. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is 2-0 in CCAA games after going 3-13 in nonconference play. 
Dominguez Hills, which shot only 28.6% to CSUN's 42.2%, dropped to 9-8, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 64, Azusa Pacific 55 -- Despite shooting 36% from the field, the 
Regals forced 32 turnovers and had 21 steals in an NAIA District 3 game at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran forward Dani Elton made two free throws to tie the score, 53-53, 
and the Regals (11-5, 4-2) went on an 11-2 run over the next 7 1/2 minutes to 
clinch the win. Elton scored nine of her game-high 19 points during that span.

CS BAKERSFIELD CRUSHES CSUN IN SWIMMING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, Friday's meeting between the Cal State Northridge and Cal State 
Bakersfield men's swim teams had the makings of a highly competitive dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, the four-time defending NCAA Division II and five-time California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion, came into the meet ranked first nationally. 
Northridge, ranked third, has won nine national titles. 
</P>
<P>
But the anticipated classic meet never materialized as Bakersfield swam away 
with a convincing 178-56 decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's competition, Northridge (7-1), the three-time defending national 
champion, had no difficulty handling Bakersfield (2-5), winning, 142-33. "It 
was an embarrassing loss," Northridge Coach Pete Accardy said, referring to the 
men's meet. "We just swam terrible. Bakersfield has a good team and there is no 
way that we could have beaten them today, especially because we are weak in 
diving this year. However, I thought that the swimming part would be close." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield won 11 of the 13 events, including the 400-yard freestyle and 
medley relays, and swept the 200-yard backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bakersfield Coach Ernie Maglischo was surprised with the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really motivated for the meet," he said. "I'm ecstatic. We swam some 
really good unshaven times for this time of the year despite training through 
the meet. It's great to win, but it doesn't mean much. We're pointing for the 
CCAA meet (Feb. 15-18)." 
</P>
<P>
Accardy also is looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an emotional rivalry, but it's only a dual meet." he said. "I didn't 
expect to see fast times, but I was upset with how slow we swam. I hope we 
learned something." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Hollahan was the bright spot for the CSUN men, winning the 100- and 
200-yard freestyles in 46.65 seconds and 1:40.53. 
</P>
<P>
In the 200 freestyle, Hollahan and Bakersfield's Brent Katzer battled on even 
terms over the last 25 yards, but Hollahan touched the wall ahead of Katzer 
(1:40.64). 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors won all 10 events, sweeping six. Lisa Dial won three events 
-- the 200 backstroke (2:22.08), 200 breaststroke (2:35.60) and 1,000 freestyle 
(10:44.26). 
</P>
<P>
Toady Kimble, the national leader in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle races, won 
those events in 25.22 and 55.97.

The slow-starting Cal State Northridge volleyball team needed another rally to 
post its second consecutive win, defeating San Diego State, 6-15, 15-17, 15-7, 
15-13, 15-11, in a nonconference match. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Coffman led the visiting Matadors (2-1) with 30 kills, and Raphael Tulino 
and Coley Kyman each had 20 kills. Doug Potter led the Aztecs (0-1) with 19

FACES . . . : WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"This is not a part you can afford to get sloppy with," says William Atherton, 
who is playing opposite Gregory Harrison and Brian McNamara as the foreboding 
Latin teacher Jerome in "Child's Play." (Robert Marasco's 1970 Tony-winner 
opens Monday at the Coast Playhouse.) "It's very dark, very intense," he says 
of the thriller set in a Catholic boys' school. "Afterward, you feel like, 
'Whoa, I've been through something.' " 
</P>
<P>
And he has been through a lot. Atherton's stage credits are impressive, 
including the original productions of David Rabe's "The Basic Training of Pavlo 
Hummel" and John Guare's "House of Blue Leaves." His film career took off in 
1974 when Steven Spielberg tapped him for the lead opposite Goldie Hawn in 
"Sugarland Express," followed by "Day of the Locust," "Looking for Mr. 
Goodbar," "Ghostbusters," the original "Die Hard" and upcoming "Die Hard 2." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not really obnoxious," the Connecticut native says of his pushy 
newscaster character in the "Die Hard" movies. "Here's the actor's apology: 
It's the kind of ambition that can take over a person. You're praised by the 
culture, but when you see that (ruthlessness) nakedly, it's not very pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Of his "Child's Play" character, the actor is likewise diplomatic: "Soul of 
granite . . . enormous integrity . . . personally formidable . . . powerful." 
</P>
<P>
Atherton, who is married to writer Bobbi Goldin, credits his longevity to "just 
always wanting to be an actor. I want to be good. I want to do good work. When 
you're with good people, you're good by default. I've also lucked out with 
terrific writers. I was friendly with John Ford Noonan at Carnegie, and when he 
wrote 'Goodbye and Keep Cold,' I was in that. John Guare saw me in that and 
cast me in 'House of Blue Leaves.' David Rabe saw me in that and cast me in 
'Pavlo Hummel.' So it was a nice start." JANICE ARKATOV

'DRUG WARS': MEXICO, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE NEWS MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What could have been an affecting story based on the life of Camarena turned 
out to be a caricature of what is supposed to be life in Mexico under the 
influence of drug lords and corrupted officials. 
</P>
<P>
The series was full of the usual stereotypical and one-dimensional characters 
we've come to know in American television and movies. 
</P>
<P>
The Latin characters are all buffoons, crooks or both. Throughout the movie I 
kept waiting for someone to blurt the line: "Badges, we don't need any steenken 
badges!" 
</P>
<P>
Even Brokaw twice asked the question: "Do you think the President should have 
sent the Marines into Mexico?" Is he aware of the repercussions of such an 
action? Relations between our countries would be strained for generations!

FACES . . . : A BRECHT-WEILL VETERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles isn't exactly a major hub on the international opera circuit -- not 
yet, anyway. So why is international opera star Julia Migenes living in Los 
Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"This is where my children (from her previous marriage) were growing up," she 
says, "and where I met my current husband," film director Peter Medak ("The 
Ruling Class"). It's also not unwise, she suggests, to be close to the film 
industry. She co-stars with Raul Julia in "Mack the Knife," Menahem Golan's new 
movie adaptation of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The Threepenny Opera," 
which opens Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Her opera-on-film debut opposite Placido Domingo in Bizet's "Carmen," as well 
as her rags-to-riches, New York streets-to-New York Met triumphs, first brought 
Migenes to the world's attention. Brecht-Weill may seem a leap from Bizet, but 
it's really a small hop for Migenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have 10 years of experience with Brecht-Weill," says the 
singer-actress in her living room, proudly pointing to an award she received 
for her 1988 recording of the duo's "The Seven Deadly Sins." Lotte Lenya, the 
first great Brecht-Weill singer as well as Weill's widow, once came backstage 
after a Migenes performance of "Mahagonny" and rewarded her with a rose. 
</P>
<P>
"Carmen" occasionally beckons her -- she was to rejoin Domingo for a recent 
production at an opera house deep in the Amazon but had to turn it down because 
of scheduling conflicts. "I'm booked two years in advance, and, if the opera 
world had its way, I'd be tied up for five years. But I refuse to do much 
Broadway or opera while my kids are young. And Peter and I are never more than 
two weeks apart from each other. There are good reasons for letting a marriage 
fall apart," she says with a wink, "but uncoordinated travel plans isn't one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Migenes will soon be reunited with Medak for his film version of Jean Cocteau's 
"The Human Voice." ("For once, I'm not playing a whore, a Gypsy or a maid. I'm 
a normal woman.") 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she enjoyed playing Jenny, a whore, to Julia's Mack the 
Knife. "We have only two scenes together, but it was fun -- Menahem was very 
jolly. He let us perform, which I like." ROBERT KOEHLER

'DRUG WARS': MEXICO, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE NEWS MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," the NBC miniseries about the murder of U.S. 
agent Enrique Camarena by Mexican drug dealers, demonstrated not only the 
complicity of the Mexican government -- and of the Reagan/Bush Administration 
in the subsequent cover-up -- but also that corruption thrives when the media 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
After the final episode, news anchor Tom Brokaw interviewed drug czar William 
Bennett, who, perhaps to justify our invasion of tiny Panama, attempted to 
downplay Mexico's role regarding drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he offered the incredible argument that drug lords operate abundantly in 
Mexico because the Bush Administration has been so successful in chasing them 
out of Miami and elsewhere. His attempt to obscure Reagan/Bush's collaboration 
with a government reportedly involved in the drug trade went unchallenged by 
Brokaw.

'ENDLESS GAME' IS A DEVIOUS SPY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The past is a foreign country," says Albert Finney as a haunted British M16 
agent in Showtime's labyrinthine "The Endless Game" (Sunday at 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
The line is a revealing touch by writer-director Bryan Forbes, who juggles the 
past and the present in this arabesque of international espionage that co-stars 
George Segal as a CIA operative whose obsessions are both kinky and 
self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
Finney's intelligence agent draws up memories of Richard Burton's grainy 
portrayal in arguably the best spy movie ever made, "The Spy Who Came in From 
the Cold" (1965). TV has rarely presented a spy tale this devious. 
</P>
<P>
But beware: Forbes' Muse here isn't so much John le Carre as the game Scrabble. 
Fitting the pieces together will keep your head spinning for the length of this 
120-minute movie. Even when it's over, ending in Moscow, you can't make sense 
of everything you saw. 
</P>
<P>
But the European co-production (shot in London, Austria and Finland) is lush 
and well-acted. Segal seems to relish his corrupt role, and the supporting cast 
is particularly flavorful, with sharp vignettes from Anthony Quayle as a 
desolate retired agent and the alluring Monica Guerritore, whose seductions 
could turn Captain Midnight into a mole. 
</P>
<P>
In short, don't worry about analyzing every subplot. This is the kind of 
treachery where the sweep of the double-dealing will carry you back to the 
glory days of the East-West war. 
</P>
<P>
Events have rushed by this movie to make it almost quaint and a little 
pretentious. On the other hand, defectors haven't gone out of style. This is 
not a careening car crash caper. The KGB aren't thugs. If you were in the 
intelligence business (and British film maker Forbes once was), you could 
attach real-life counterparts to these characters. RAY LOYND

'JEKYLL &amp; HYDE' OFFERS MUTANT VERSION OF CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Jekyll &amp; Hyde" (at 9 p.m. Sunday on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is a mutant 
version of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic. 
</P>
<P>
The production, shot in London, adds Michael Caine to the gallery of stars who 
have preceded him as the tormented doctor (notably John Barrymore, Fredric 
March and Spencer Tracy); we'll ignore the several bizarre spinoffs, such as 
Martine Beswick in "Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde"). 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, all this remake does is reconfirm the 1931 March movie as 
untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
Jekyll and Hyde buffs will not be happy with writer-director David Wickes' 
script, which reduces the crucial role of the original story's murdered 
prostitute to a bit part. The doctor's obsession now is his already-married 
aristocratic ex-sister-in-law, who is played by Cheryl Ladd. 
</P>
<P>
Caine seems a bit uncomfortable in his monstrous Hyde get-up (just as Tracy did 
in his 1941 film with Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner). But Ladd, in her 
Edwardian bustles and lush coiffures, looks regal and bedazzling, and she 
conveys a veiled lust for Jekyll that scandalizes London society. 
</P>
<P>
But the story's psychological eroticism is missing, and the knobby, 
forehead-and-knuckle-popping scenes, in which Jekyll is transformed into the 
bestial Hyde, are more state-of-the-art wizardry than horrific. 
</P>
<P>
Rich production values, ranging from polite society to a dank Limehouse tavern 
and brothel, help the show. And Dr. Jekyll's risible lecture to his medical 
students about "hell on Earth," about science controlling our very shapes and 
intelligence, rings more frightening today than before. 
</P>
<P>
A little dramatic license can be innocent enough too -- the plot twist of an 
"Omen"-like child fathered by Dr. Jekyll, for instance. It may be hokey but by 
that point it doesn't matter. But the colors are too bright, the mood too flat, 
the tone too stale to do justice to this great story. Where is Sister Hyde when 
we need her? RAY LOYND

<P>
With the National Football League taking its traditional hiatus between the 
conference championship games and the Super Bowl, the television networks are 
turning to hockey and heavy doses of collegiate and professional basketball to 
fill the void this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since May 24, 1980, a National Hockey League game will be 
telecast by a major network, with NBC airing the 41st All-Star Game Sunday at 
10:30 a.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39. Cognizant of the bad camera angles that 
have traditionally made hockey a difficult sport to televise, NBC plans to 
station its cameras lower than usual and use a panoramic camera attached to the 
bottom of the center-ice scoreboard for an aerial view. 
</P>
<P>
A heavier than usual college basketball schedule includes four consecutive 
games on Channel 2 today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Seton Hall at Pittsburgh at 9 
a.m; No. 3 Oklahoma at No. 23 Arizona at 11 a.m.; Notre Dame vs. No. 13 LSU at 
1 p.m. and USC at Stanford at 3 p.m. Channel 8 in San Diego will also carry the 
first three games.) On Sunday, No. 16 UCLA faces California at 3 p.m. on 
Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Professional basketball moves to the forefront Sunday with a doubleheader 
featuring the National Basketball Assn.'s most attractive teams and players. 
The Lakers have their last chance at revenge against the Detroit Pistons before 
the playoffs at 9 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8, with the same stations broadcasting 
the Chicago Bulls-New York Knicks match-up at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mix celebrities from entertainment, politics and other sports with professional 
golfers and the result is the Bob Hope Classic, seen on Channels 4, 36 and 39 
today and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, for those who need football of any type to get through a weekend, 
there are three games this weekend. College seniors seeking to increase their 
worth in the NFL draft will perform in today's Senior Bowl at 11:30 a.m. on 
ESPN and the East-West Shrine Game Sunday at 11:30 a.m. on Channels 7, 3 and 
10. Jim Plunkett, Bart Starr and Roger Staubach are among former NFL stars 
participating in the inaugural Pro Football Legends Bowl, taped Friday in 
Phoenix, and shown at 3:30 p.m. today on Channel 4. STEVEN HERBERT

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: EASE THE MOVE FOR 4-YEAR-OLD

<TEXT>

DEAR DR. BROTHERS: We deliberately postponed moving so it wouldn't interrupt 
our 10-year-old's school year, but now we're amazed at how upset our 4-year-old 
is. Since he didn't have much to interrupt in the way of friends or 
commitments, we thought it would be relatively unimportant to him. He's become 
very anxious and is suffering from nightmares. What are we doing wrong? -- D.P. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.P.: Child psychologists point out that often when little children see 
all the boxes being tied up ready to be sent away and possessions being packed 
or thrown out, it makes them fear that this may also happen to them. It is 
important to reassure your child that he's coming with you. Help him to look 
forward to being part of the family in a new town and meeting new friends. 
</P>
<P>
After you move, don't redecorate your child's room for a while, and arrange 
furniture as it was before. Dr. Tiffany Field of the University of Miami 
Medical School says that having the old furniture in place can be like a 
security blanket. 
</P>
<P>
Remember not to throw away all the old toys and books. Children need a sense of 
continuity, and it's vital to be able to hang on to some objects that bring 
comfort and solace. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: When I was in my second year of college, I cheated on an 
exam and was caught by the teacher and expelled. Eventually, I enrolled at 
another school and got my degree, but I've never gotten over the feeling of 
shame. It almost led me to suicide. My parents thought I was overreacting, even 
though they were very angry at the time. I know lots of kids cheat, and I 
wonder if my reaction is normal. -- W.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR W.F.: Shame is a powerful emotion because it cuts through to one's basic 
sense of self. Certainly, shame would be a normal feeling after what happened 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
Shame becomes dangerous when it starts to color one's most basic idea about 
what one is or how worthy one is. You may need counseling to rid yourself of 
this past error if you feel shame every time someone rebukes you and if, 
despite beginning again and getting your degree, you still feel guilty and 
worry that you're not to be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of shame are often at the root of what may seem like irrational rage, 
according to some experts, and shame has been shown to play a key role in many 
cases of family violence. 
</P>
<P>
The best antidote to shame is to get it in enough perspective to be able to 
laugh at it. After all, this is something that happened a long time ago. Talk 
with someone about it. Don't keep it to yourself any longer. You've learned 
from your mistakes and that is what's important now.

BOB GREENE: STRAIGHT FROM CELEBRITIES' LIPS

<P>
Lots of people collect autographs. It's a fairly common hobby -- seeking the 
signatures of famous men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Jilly Eddy, of Walnut Creek, Calif., has a similar hobby. Similar, but quite 
different. Eddy collects lip prints. 
</P>
<P>
"Lip prints are just what they sound like," said Eddy, who sells appliances for 
Sears. "They're prints of people's lips." Lip prints, she said, are also 
referred to as "lipographs." 
</P>
<P>
Eddy, 44, said she has been collecting lip prints for almost 10 years. "I keep 
them in a lip print book," she said. "It's pretty much like an autograph book, 
except it's filled with people's lip prints." 
</P>
<P>
On each page of her lip print book is the lip print of a different person. "A 
lip print is much more personal than an autograph," Eddy said. "People sign 
their names lots of times. They sign checks and stuff every day. They don't 
even think about it. A lip print, though, is special. You have to press your 
lips against a piece of paper. And each lip print is as individual as a 
fingerprint. No two lip prints are the same. But a lip print is much more 
sensuous than a fingerprint." 
</P>
<P>
In order to give Eddy a lip print, a person must first put lipstick on his or 
her mouth (more about that in a moment). Then there is a certain technique. . 
.well, let's have Eddy explain it herself: 
</P>
<P>
"You put the lipstick on. You keep your mouth open just a bit when you're 
pressing it onto the paper. While you do it, you should pretend that you're 
kissing someone you really like -- pretend that you're giving that person a 
good kiss. Without any tongue, though -- that leaves a smudge." 
</P>
<P>
The results, she said, are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"I like lip prints from a person who has nice, full lips. Lips that have a nice 
shape to them. The best kind of upper lip, I think, has a bowed shape, with an 
indentation in the top. The best lower lips are just a little fuller than the 
upper lip." 
</P>
<P>
She claims she can tell something about a person just by his or her lip print: 
</P>
<P>
"I have found that a person with full lips usually likes to talk a lot -- 
people whose lip prints are full are gabbers. People with thin lips tend to be 
more conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Eddy collects lip prints from both men and women. This sometimes presents a 
problem. As we have noted, to give a lip print, a person must put on lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
"Women tend to love the idea," Eddy said. "They really get into doing this. I 
tell them to put on a really bright red lipstick. Most women wear peach 
lipstick or pink lipstick; but for a lip print to look good, I tell the women 
to put on the kind of lipstick that Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield used to 
wear. Bright, bright red, really spread over the lips thickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Some men are willing to put lipstick on if they know it's for the purpose of a 
lip print. The others, though, I tell to kiss a woman who's wearing a lot of 
lipstick, and then to put their lip prints in my book while the women's 
lipstick is still on their lips. It's pretty easy: A man kisses a woman, then 
he kisses my book." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, this man-kisses-a-woman-then-kisses-the-book technique was first 
tried out on a rather well-known man: Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I was living in Bellingham, Wash., at the time, and I was driving a limousine 
for a living," Eddy said. "I was driving Johnny Cash when he was in town, and I 
picked him up at the Holiday Inn; he was with his manager and his lead 
guitarist. He signed his autograph for me, and I told him that I would rather 
have his lip print. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything for a second, and then in this deep, deep voice he 
said: 'I don't wear lipstick.' So I said to him, 'Well, what you can do is kiss 
someone who does wear lipstick, and then kiss my book.' He said, 'Well, OK,' 
and he gave me a big kiss and then he kissed my lip print book. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I was wearing this very expensive Estee Lauder nonsmudge 
lipstick that day, and because it was nonsmudge, not all that much of it got on 
Johnny Cash's lips, so his lip print in my book is sort of faint." 
</P>
<P>
One of the nice things about collecting lip prints, Eddy said, is that -- 
unlike autographs -- a lip print from a non-celebrity can be as good as a lip 
print from a celebrity. With an autograph, it's how famous the person is; with 
a lip print, it's how good the person's lips are. 
</P>
<P>
And, no, Eddy said, there is absolutely no way to tell from a person's lip 
print whether or not that person is a good kisser.

NISSAN IS JAPAN'S FIRST CAR MAKER TO GO ALL-AMERICAN; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: WORK HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON A MINI-VAN THAT WILL BE DESIGNED, 
ENGINEERED AND BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES.

In what could represent a dramatic shift in Japanese business strategy, Japan's 
auto makers are starting to develop the ability to completely design, engineer 
and build new cars in the United States -- with little or no input from their 
central offices in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, has quietly become the first major 
Japanese firm to begin work on such an all-American project. Here on the 
outskirts of Detroit, Nissan has set up a sprawling engineering complex where 
260 Japanese and American engineers and other staffers -- many of them emigres 
from the nearby offices of the Big Three auto makers -- are working side by 
side on the first Japanese auto to be developed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan Research and Development, the auto maker's engineering unit, is 
performing the developmental work on a new mini-van that was designed by 
Nissan's design studio in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1992, the front-wheel-drive mini-van will be assembled in a Ford 
factory in Avon Lake, Ohio, through a joint venture between Nissan and Ford and 
finally will be sold both by Nissan and by Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division. 
</P>
<P>
While Nissan and other major Japanese auto makers have had design and styling 
studios in California for years, the Nissan mini-van represents the first time 
that a Japanese product designed in California will actually be engineered and 
fully developed in the United States. Previously, initial clay models proposed 
by stylists in Southern California were shipped back to Japan, where Japanese 
engineers then turned the designs into cars ready for manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's decision to shift engineering resources from Japan to the United 
States follows new policy guidelines set by the company's top management to try 
to become a truly global company, rather than just a Japanese corporation that 
sells worldwide, according to Nissan R&amp;D President Takeshi Tanuma, who is 
now based here in Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
"Nissan wants to have one complete auto company in the United States," Tanuma 
said. "Once we have a complete auto company here, then we will be insiders in 
the American auto industry." 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's action also follows years of warnings by some American economists and 
industry observers that the Japanese would provide only unskilled factory jobs 
to Americans -- so that they could assemble cars here and thus skirt U.S. trade 
sanctions -- but would always keep the really good jobs for highly educated 
professionals back home in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"They only want our brute strength," Maryann Keller, the well-known automotive 
analyst with the Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney brokerage in New York, 
has complained. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Nissan's mini-van project has required help from Japan. For 
example, the van's front-wheel-drive transmission and its V-6 engine were 
designed in Japan -- at least in part because Nissan engineers felt that Ford's 
comparable American-designed engines were outmoded. 
</P>
<P>
But Tanuma still believes that the rapid pace of change in the U.S. car market 
is making it increasingly difficult for designers and engineers working in 
Japan to keep up with American tastes, without at least some engineering and 
design facilities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The recent flap over the court case involving a Nissan engineer who lived 
undercover with an Orange County family -- allegedly spying on them and their 
neighbors while concealing his real identity -- was really an outgrowth of the 
new Japanese determination to "Americanize" their products. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for Japanese engineers to tell what is luxury in the United 
States, to tell what American tastes are," Tanuma said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it possible for a Japanese to understand American tastes while sitting in 
Tokyo on a tatami mat? To understand what it is like to sit in a big American 
house, with a big American living room, while he is sitting in his . . . little 
Japanese apartment?" 
</P>
<P>
Honda has also begun to rely more heavily on American engineers for its new 
cars. About 250 Honda engineers, working at the company's massive Marysville, 
Ohio, manufacturing complex, are performing most of the development work on a 
new 1991 Honda Accord station wagon, which was largely designed by Honda's 
design center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Accord station wagon will be produced exclusively in the United States and 
then exported to the rest of the world, according to Shigeaki Kato, Honda 
spokesman in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
But Honda has not yet taken the leap that Nissan has -- completely developing a 
new product in America. Kato noted that while the Accord wagon was developed 
here, the basic Accord sedan model was designed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've said that Honda would become a self-reliant company in this 
country," he added, "and that means that eventually we want to design, engineer 
and build a car completely independent of Japan. But you don't do that 
overnight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our (American) manufacturing in Ohio is now mature, and the research and 
development and engineering aspects of our American operations are growing," 
Kato added. "The next step could possibly be a complete car."

MERCURY S&amp;L ORDERED TO HALT LENDING, INVESTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH INSTITUTION HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH LOSSES. IT'S 
THE FOURTH MAJOR S&amp;L IN CALIFORNIA TO BE HIT WITH STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS 
THIS YEAR.

Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, struggling for a year to curb losses, said it was 
ordered Friday by federal regulators in San Francisco to halt all lending and 
investment activities. 
</P>
<P>
The order does not affect the S&amp;L's routine customer deposits nor its 
$3-billion loan-servicing portfolio. The S&amp;L also can fill pending 
commitments for loans and investments, but no new loans or investments can be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Shane, chairman of the Huntington Beach-based S&amp;L, said Friday in 
an interview that he will seek a meeting with regulators as soon as possible to 
try to ease the restrictions so that Mercury can make single-family home loans 
of up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is the fourth major S&amp;L in the state this year to be placed under 
such severe operating restrictions. The others are Valley Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan in Van Nuys, Imperial Savings Assn. in San Diego and Santa Barbara Savings 
&amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which lost $5.4 million in the first nine months last year, has nearly 
run out of tangible capital, which is essentially the amount of cash it has as 
a final reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
It said it doesn't meet any of the three strict capital tests imposed under a 
federal law enacted in August to bail out the thrift industry's deposit 
insurance fund. Its tangible capital is negligible, only 0.04% of assets at the 
end of September -- well below the required 1.5% level. Its core capital, 
another test, was 1.54%, nearly half the required 3% level. No information is 
available on the third test, which weighs the risk of the S&amp;L's loans and 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, who formerly headed the thrift industry's chief California and national 
trade groups, said his institution sent regulators a business plan and a plan 
for raising capital, but regulators have not yet responded to his proposals. 
Mercury essentially is reducing assets and trying to sell five Northern 
California branches in an effort to obtain cash. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts and consultants are already writing the S&amp;L's obituary, 
saying it is essentially insolvent and can be rescued only through a sale. 
Mercury has hired investment bankers to search for a possible suitor or 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisory order is "tantamount to failure," said Bert Ely, an industry 
consultant in Alexandria, Va. He said the order could be viewed as the 
regulators' answer to Shane's business and capital plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Most institutions cannot survive very long under this type of order," said Don 
Murray, a thrift accounting partner at the Irvine office of Deloitte &amp; 
Touche, a national accounting firm. In similar situations, such letters simply 
put institutions in a holding pattern until regulators decide what to do with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury has 24 branches and 800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
If Mercury simply plans to sell assets to increase its capital, the 
restrictions may not hurt it badly, Murray said. But if the S&amp;L had planned 
to invest proceeds from asset sales to earn capital, then the restrictions pose 
serious problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L, which had $2.25 billion in assets at the end of September, ran 
into serious problems with commercial and construction loans in the mid 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate it obtained through foreclosures or bankruptcies left Mercury with 
a large number of properties that produced no income. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, its repossessed properties amounted to nearly $14 
million, or 11.1% of its assets. Well-managed S&amp;Ls typically keep that 
figure below 1%, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, accountants' estimates of future earnings from servicing loans and 
of future tax liabilities were inaccurate a year ago. Mercury had to restate 
its 1988 profit and post a $13.8-million loss for that year. Those accounting 
procedures continued to plague the S&amp;L last year. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mercury hasn't invested in high-yield junk bonds or other risky 
investments that placed other S&amp;Ls in jeopardy, its accounting assumptions 
on future income constituted a risky venture, Ely said.

DPC Ends Hostile Bid for Dataproducts: DPC Acquisition Corp., citing "disarray 
in the financial markets," ended its yearlong hostile effort to buy 
Dataproducts Corp. by scrapping a $190-million tender offer for the Woodland 
Hills maker of computer printers. The New York investor group, which already 
owns 7.5% of Dataproducts' stock, had offered $10 cash for each of the 
remaining shares. But since launching the offer in October, DPC's investment 
bankers had been unable to raise the cash.

CAMPEAU WORRIES HURT RALPHS' BONDS

<P>
Concerns that Ralphs Grocery Co. will be drawn into the financial morass of its 
bankrupt sister companies in the Campeau Corp. drove down the junk bonds of the 
supermarket chain on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The $400 million in bonds, issued in 1988 when Ralphs became an independent 
subsidiary of Campeau, fell $5 to close at $81 (per $100 in face value). The 
bonds, down from as high as $97 last week, have traded at more than $105 in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials, however, dismissed the possibility that the 143-store Ralphs 
chain would be hurt by the problems of Campeau's Federated Department Stores 
and Allied Stores divisions. The Federated and Allied units, which together 
make up the second-biggest department store organization in the United States, 
filed Monday for court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Reed, Ralphs' chief financial officer, called the decline in the company's 
bonds "an emotional response" to the department store companies' bankruptcy 
filings. 
</P>
<P>
"The bankruptcy has no effect on us," Reed said. "It's business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Investors, however, apparently have been worried about a few matters. Some 
concern has stemmed from fear that Ralphs might be required to pay the deferred 
taxes of Federated Stores, the U.S. retailing arm of Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that under a tax-sharing agreement between Ralphs and Federated 
Stores, the supermarket chain would not be responsible for the parent company's 
deferred taxes. He added that even if the agreement was voided, the parent 
company should have enough assets to cover the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns are related to speculation that Ohio real estate developer 
Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., an Ohio shopping mall developer, would foreclose on a 
$480-million loan to Campeau that is secured by Ralphs. DeBartolo has signed a 
so-called standstill agreement promising not to take action against Campeau 
until at least May. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs officials said even after the agreement lapses, DeBartolo is unlikely to 
try to take over the supermarket chain. They said that such a move could 
trigger a deferred gains tax bill of more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Wedelstaedt, a bond analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, added that 
DeBartolo probably does not want to get directly involved in the supermarket 
business. She said that he would be more likely to swap the debt he is owed for 
stock in Ralphs, leaving the current management intact. 
</P>
<P>
Another worry raised has been the possibility of investors filing a fraudulent 
conveyance suit against Ralphs, claiming that the chain's assets were 
improperly transferred when it was set up as an independent subsidiary. Ralphs 
officials, however, said the company has a strong defense against such a suit 
and that investors were likely to raise the prospect of legal action strictly 
as a bargaining maneuver in bankruptcy negotiations.

EX-PRESIDENT OF ASHTON-TATE TO HEAD NEW FIRM

Luther J. Nussbaum, who quit his job as president of troubled software vendor 
Ashton-Tate last July, has resurfaced as chairman and chief executive of an 
unusual new company that is acquiring computer networking firms around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Evernet Systems, a Los Angeles firm whose formal debut will be announced 
Monday, aims to forge a national company for the installation and maintenance 
of so-called local and wide area networks, which are increasingly used by 
businesses to link personal computers and related equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by $5 million in venture capital, Evernet is buying small local computer 
service firms -- known as value-added resellers (VARs) -- that specialize in 
local area networks, offering them a small amount of cash and a larger amount 
of Evernet stock. The companies then become the local office for Evernet. 
</P>
<P>
Evernet expects to buy 10-15 companies during the next year, each with revenues 
in the $3-million to $10-million range, and then continue its growth through 
internal expansion before going public in several years. It is also opening an 
Orange County office, which Nussbaum said will serve as a trial run in opening 
new branches from scratch.

R. J. REYNOLDS CANCELS TEST OF CIGARETTE AIMED AT BLACKS

<P>
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., under fire for targeting its new Uptown cigarette 
brand to black smokers, said Friday that it would cancel test-marketing of the 
brand in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The company did not say whether it would ever introduce the mentholated brand. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release announcing its action, Reynolds complained of the "unfair and 
biased attention" the brand had received. "This represents a loss of choice for 
black smokers and a further erosion of the free enterprise system," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Black and Hispanic groups, as well as anti-smoking interests, had harshly 
attacked Reynolds for the new brand, which the company acknowledged was 
intended to appeal to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dr. Louis Sullivan, the nation's top health official, bitterly 
denounced Reynolds and urged it to cancel the plans for the test-marketing, 
which was to begin Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hoult, the Reynolds executive quoted in the company's news release, said 
a "small coalition of anti-smoking zealots" forced the tobacco firm to cancel 
its plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intentions in test-marketing Uptown in Philadelphia have been misconstrued 
and misrepresented by the anti-smoking lobby," said Hoult, who is executive 
vice president for marketing. "Our sole purpose, plainly and simply, was to 
test market a cigarette among smokers who currently buy competitive products."

A Palestinian official accused Abu Nidal's terrorist group of kidnaping two 
Swiss workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross, newspapers in 
Beirut reported. Zeid Wehbe, an official in the mainstream Fatah movement of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Fatah-Revolutionary Council 
headed by Abu Nidal was responsible for the abduction of Elio Erriquez and 
Emmanuel Christen, both orthopedic technicians with the ICRC. Erriquez, 23, and 
Christen, 32, were kidnaped Oct. 6 near the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein El 
Helweh on the outskirts of the port city of Sidon.

<P>
Anglican envoy Terry Waite begins today his fourth year as a hostage of 
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim militants with his fate, and those of other captives, 
apparently hinging on a power struggle in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
A reliable Shiite source, who is familiar with the thinking of the 
hostage-holding factions, said the issue of the 18 Westerners missing in 
Lebanon is "on the back burner" until Iran's political infighting is settled. 
Waite, 50, disappeared in Muslim West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. He was last seen 
leaving his seaside hotel to keep a rendezvous with kidnapers holding two 
Americans -- journalist Terry Anderson and Scottish-born educator Thomas 
Sutherland -- to negotiate their release.

Nicaragua's main opposition alliance threatened to withdraw from the Feb. 25 
general elections unless the nation's Central Bank immediately release hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in U.S. aid, a Sandinista official said. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega, in a display of flexibility, had ordered the bank to 
pay out $600,000 last Monday even though bank procedures had not been complied 
with, according to Sandinista campaign manager Bayardo Arce. Officials of the 
National Opposition Union had accused the government of deliberately holding up 
the money. Opposition spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.

South Africa announced major defense cuts, reflecting an easing of tensions in 
southern Africa, especially over Namibia and Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts included cancellation of 11 army weapons and equipment projects, 
disbandment of units and phasing out of aircraft. The defense budget is about 
$4 billion a year. Officials did not give the size of the reduction, but a 
newspaper recently said $577 million would be cut from the next budget.

<P>
The anti-Robert Dornan column (Opinion, Jan. 14) was classic name-calling by a 
true liberal Washington carpetbagger meddling in Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Matthews knows all the pejoratives: "John Wayne politics of Orange 
County," "most hawkish," "peripatetic ex-Los Angeles talk-show host," 
"arch-conservative" and, of course, "B-1 Bob." 
</P>
<P>
But, for his darling Ron Kovic: "paralyzed war hero," "combat veteran," 
"someone who speaks in grand phrases" and "Marine sergeant who endured the 
horror of Vietnam and the inhumanity of a V.A. hospital." Please, give us a 
break! 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kovic is the perfect choice for a Democratic Party now dominated by every 
manner of crazy on the left fringe of America: a disturbed Viet vet backed by 
Hollywood. I can't wait for the inevitable Jane Fonda fund-raisers!

'BORDER BRUJO': FROM AZTEC TO HIGH TECH; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE ART: GUILLERMO GOMEZ-PENA'S TWISTED BORDER TRAVELOGUE OFFERS LIVE 
AND VIDEO VERSIONS OF LIFE THROUGH THE EYES OF A SHAMAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Guillermo Gomez-Pena's "Border Brujo II," the brujo, or shaman, labels the 
border region the ultimate casa de cambio -- a full-service house of exchange 
where "anything can change into anything." 
</P>
<P>
Dollars can be changed into pesos and the brujo can change "from Aztec to high 
tech without missing a beat." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely what happens, and rather stunningly, in Gomez-Pena's new, 
multimedia version of his twisted border travelogue, which incorporates a video 
by Isaac Artenstein. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the show (closing tonight at 8 at Sushi Performance 
Gallery), Gomez-Pena performs live, seated at a table adorned with candles, a 
few props and the radio that provides the musical and commercial prompts for 
brujo incarnations. In the second half, Gomez-Pena lies prone before the 
audience while Artenstein's video -- which simply depicts the brujo on a 
slightly more elaborate set -- is projected onto a screen, with the electronic 
brujo continuing Gomez-Pena's multi-persona litany of sometimes angry, 
sometimes funny observations about life on the border. 
</P>
<P>
The purist may ask: "Why a video? I paid to see a live performance, not watch 
television." (The video is, in fact, part of a work-in-progress -- a 
feature-length film a la performance artist Spaulding Gray's "Swimming to 
Cambodia." Do they dare call it "Swimming to America"?) 
</P>
<P>
The decision to add a high-tech element to Gomez-Pena's decidedly low-tech 
stage show was wise. On a physical level, it allows the audience to see, 
through Artenstein's selection of camera angles and deft editing, the brujo up 
close and personal. Gomez-Pena is a compelling live performer, and his 
electronic counterpart -- with searing eyes and sneering visage -- is no less 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
On a psychic level, the multimedia approach provides another realm, another 
dimension for the brujo to enter. When Gomez-Pena is performing live, seated 
and speaking into a microphone, he seems like a disc jockey broadcasting on a 
border radio station with an otherworldly wattage. Video makes the border brujo 
a mystical media mogul. The live brujo can rest while his electronic alter ego 
dramatizes the "tormented privilege" of living in California. Imagine turning 
on the TV, flipping through the cable channels and coming across a guy in a 
wrestling mask, sitting at his throne on the shrine of border culture, and 
speaking in tongues. 
</P>
<P>
He also speaks Indian dialects, Spanish and English, and their bastardizations: 
"Spanglish" and "Inglenol." Many of Gomez-Pena's clever word plays require at 
least some bilingual ability on the part of audience. Some are further obscured 
by his often rapid-fire delivery and, at Thursday's opening performance, by the 
nuances of amplification and Sushi's murky acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
But toward the end, as the live brujo rises and performs with the video brujo, 
a gripping visual scene unfolds with the dual images. It is slightly impaired 
by the presence of the video projector, which is necessarily in close 
proximity. If the creators continue this multimedia approach, the effect would 
be enhanced by a rear screen projector. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the brujo also has an electronic life, perhaps the live brujo can 
leave the confines of the theater and return to the streets, where 
confrontational performance art is most effective and where Gomez-Pena has 
often exhibited his political poetics. There's an intersection in rural 
Carlsbad begging for a command performance.

'AS IS' CAPTURES DELICATE BALANCE OF AIDS' HORRORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When they write the definitive history of the '80s, William Hoffman's "As Is" 
will have to be considered one of the cultural milestones -- not because the 
play is the best of the decade or the most innovative or even the most 
eloquent, but because it captures both the beginning and end of an era, 
freezing the moment in time when the horror of AIDS set in as a social reality. 
</P>
<P>
And it does so with such deft skill that it has the compelling urgency of a 
living document, while always maintaining a buoyancy that keeps us entertained. 
Without ever devaluing the suffering or the rage that AIDS inevitably brings in 
its wake, the play transmutes despair into gallows humor, and dread into 
pathos. Hoffman's considerable wit as a writer has been to achieve a delicate 
three-way balance between comedy, tragedy and -- for lack of a better term -- 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
In 90 swift minutes at the Forum Theatre here, this production by the South 
Orange County Community Theatre sketches in the lives of Rich (Dan Millington) 
and Saul (Mike Moon), a gay New York couple who have recently broken up. Rich, 
a writer who has just published a collection of short stories, has gone off to 
live with a new lover named Chet. Saul, a photographer, is still living at the 
old apartment and still in love with Rich. 
</P>
<P>
After watching them bicker over a division of their possessions -- the cat, 
Aunt Billie's hooked rug, the collectibles, the Barcelona chair and "the 
world's largest collection of Magic Marker hustler portraits" -- we soon learn 
in a quick collage of scenes with a chorus of doctors, relatives and friends 
that Rich has been diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Saul is shocked. One of their friends recently died in San Francisco. Another, 
whom he has just visited in the hospital, is in the terminal throes of the 
disease. "The good news," Rich says "is that I have only swollen glands." The 
bad news, of course, is that he is experiencing denial. The next is fear and 
bitter anger, then self-pity -- "Why me?" -- and finally, with Saul's 
comforting acceptance of him "as is," the inevitable descent toward death. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the play so affecting is that while the characters are caught on the 
brink of disaster, they never descend into sentimentality. Hoffman goes out of 
his way in the writing to deflate any special plea for sympathy. And both leads 
give sterling performances. Millington brings a taut clarity to the role of 
Rich, while Moon infuses the role of Saul with vivid warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Two scenes alone are worth the price of admission. One, in a hustler bar, 
satirizes the homosexual mating dance of a pair of leather-clad clones named 
Chuck and Chad. "Thought you were this guy Chip I met here on Jockstrap Night," 
Chad says. "Haven't been here since the Slave Auction," Chuck says. The other 
scene, at an AIDS hot line office, is also brilliantly funny. (Jon Taylor 
Carter is a scream.) 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the cast who lend support in multiple roles are Bart Story, 
John David and David Napier. Particularly good are B.J. Scott, whose monologues 
as a hospice worker tuck the play into context, and Ardis Faith, who is 
gorgeous as the leggy knockout, Lilly. Sandy Silver's direction keeps the pace 
of the action flowing nicely. 
</P>
<P>
A final note: "As Is," the winner of a 1985 Drama Desk Award and three Tony 
nominations, earned the distinction last May of being banned in Garden Grove, 
where another community theater dropped plans to produce it under pressure from 
a member of the City Council who objected to its content. We ought to be 
grateful. Without Garden Grove's craven censorship, this fine amateur 
production might never have been mounted.

Personal and creative differences have shaken up Imagining Yellow Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Singer-guitarist Ed Bernard is leaving the Orange County band, which released 
its debut album last year on Dr. Dream records. 
</P>
<P>
The three other members -- Tim Bugge, Steve Cross and Rob Fadtke -- will 
recruit a replacement for Bernard and carry on with the name Imagining Yellow 
Suns, according to Dr. Dream's vice president, David Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the label is "a little worried" about the impact of losing Bernard, 
who sang and wrote lyrics for most of the songs on the album. Still, he said, 
"we're supporting the guys. We think Tim and Steve and Rob are all talented 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said that Dr. Dream's contract with the band calls for two more records. 
</P>

Former Scarecrows front man David Pedroza has surfaced with a new band, Spanish 
Fly, which made its Orange County debut Wednesday at Foul Play in Huntington 
Beach. The lineup includes two old associates of Pedroza, former Scarecrows 
drummer Mike Petrus and keyboard player Joe Simon (who also is a member of 
Broken Homes). Rounding out the band are guitarist Brett Balaban and bassist 
Oliver Mariachi -- players whom Pedroza has recruited since his move last year 
from Orange County to Hollywood. The band's sound is close to the Scarecrows' 
Rolling Stones-style rock, but with Simon's sweet-sounding organ and electric 
piano taking over from the guitars as the primary lead instruments. MIKE BOEHM

OFFICIALS SAY DRUGS KEEP AIDS CASES BELOW ESTIMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
County health officials say the increased use of potent drugs is slowing the 
occurrence of AIDS in San Diego and keeping the number of cases below 
projections made by experts three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Department of Health Services received 525 reports of new 
AIDS cases last year, fewer than the 606 cases projected for 1989 by Dr. 
Michele Ginsberg, the county epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
But County Health Officer Dr. Donald Ramras said the number of cases of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not decreasing but surfacing at a slower 
rate because the virus that causes AIDS is taking longer to develop into the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
More effective medication, such as AZT and pentamidine, is being used more 
widely to slow the replication of the virus and to ward off other infections 
that attack a patient's weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier projections estimated 728 new cases in 1990 and another 839 in 
1991. Health officials now expect about 550 additional AIDS cases this year; a 
revised projection for 1991 was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"The projections are lower than what they were a few years ago, but that does 
not mean that the epidemic is over," Ramras said. "Available treatment is 
keeping people from developing the disease for a longer period of time, but 
it's not curing them." 
</P>
<P>
"There are many, many people out there who are ill and infected with the AIDS 
virus, but are not ill enough to fit the case description, so we don't know 
about them," Ramras said. State law requires that physicians report to health 
officials only those patients who have fully developed cases of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
A person who has contracted the AIDS virus might not develop symptoms of the 
disease for eight to 10 years, and now can remain symptom-free even longer with 
the use of better drugs. But, sooner or later, those people will raise the AIDS 
toll, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless, of course, we find a cure," he said. "Unfortunately, I don't 
anticipate that happening anytime soon." 
</P>
<P>
Since the county Department of Health Services began tracking AIDS patients in 
1981, a total of 1,702 county residents have been found to have the disease. 
More than 60%, or 1,025, have died, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
Even more fatalities are expected as the disease makes inroads into the 
heterosexual community, according to health officials and private groups 
fighting the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a dramatic rise in the number of AIDS cases among 
heterosexuals," said Bill Freeman, executive director of the AIDS Assistance 
Fund of San Diego County, a nonprofit group that offers a variety of services, 
including providing food, shelter and emergency grants to people suffering from 
AIDS and AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
Bisexual practices and intravenous drug use are two primary reasons for the 
spread of the disease among heterosexuals, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a few years ago, 80% to 90% of all AIDS cases nationwide were among gay 
and bisexual men," Freeman said. "Now that number has gone down to about 65%, 
which tells you that the disease is no longer contained within a discrete 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many people out there who believe that only certain people can 
get AIDS," Freeman added. "Well, that's just not true. All of America is 
susceptible. The virus doesn't discriminate. It isn't who you are or where you 
are, it's what you do" that puts you at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Some private care groups, including the AIDS Assistance Fund, have expressed 
concern that the county's method of counting AIDS cases excludes hundreds who 
have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say county statistics do not take into account San Diego residents in 
whom AIDS was diagnosed before they moved here. 
</P>
<P>
According to state reporting laws, physicians are required to report only cases 
that develop in their counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We only report the cases that are diagnosed here," Ramras said. "If someone 
from St. Paul, Minn., moves to San Diego and was diagnosed with the disease 
before he came here, then it's the responsibility of the health officials in 
St. Paul to take note of that case."

LA JOLLA INDIANS COURT OFF-ROAD VEHICLES 
</P>

<P>
Much of the 9,000-acre La Jolla Indian Reservation in remote north San Diego 
County is unforgiving terrain -- too hard for digging, too thickly covered with 
brush or too hilly, as it rises up the base of Palomar Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's land we can't use," said Mitzi Magante, La Jolla Indian chairman. "It's 
not suitable for housing. We can't afford to develop it for housing. The ground 
is clay and granite and a lot of rocks." 
</P>
<P>
But Indian leaders have now begun to see the potential for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in their dirt, and they are asking the state to size up 
the reservation, northeast of Valley Center, as an off-road vehicle park. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla band of Luiseno Indians on Friday presented its exploratory 
proposal for an off-road park to the Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation 
Commission, a nine-member panel charged with working with the state Parks and 
Recreation Department to build and maintain trails for four-wheel-drive, 
three-wheeler and motocross bike enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of off-road enthusiasts, the commission and department have been 
trying for years to find about 1,000 acres that can serve as a nearby 
playground. The state already maintains a large vehicular park in Ocotillo 
Wells, but the off-roaders say it is not close enough for them to use for only 
a few hours or during the week after work. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the state has been looking south, to Otay Mesa, for a solution. It has 
identified a potential 1,200-acre site, 920 acres of which are owned by 
developer Roque de la Fuente II. 
</P>
<P>
But a deal with De la Fuente -- $5 million for the state to take title to the 
land, only to give it back to him in 20 years -- failed to get through the 
Legislature last year because of the price and the novelty of the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed talks with De la Fuente are expected to begin soon, and indications are 
that the state is looking at paying as much or more for the site, since a 
recent state audit shows his land is worth $11 million to $12 million, state 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, the La Jolla Indian proposal -- although a surprise -- 
immediately piqued the interest of Off-Highway Commission members, who 
instructed their staff to look into the idea and requested a tour of the San 
Diego County reservation before their next meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
What commission members will find, said Magante, is a band of 300 Indians who 
are eager to take on a year-round enterprise like an off-road park because of 
the prospect it will create about 20 full-time jobs. That means a lot to a 
reservation with an unemployment rate of more than 50%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need year-round enterprises," said Magante. "Right now, we have three 
enterprises on the reservation -- an 800-unit campground, a general store, and 
we do have an aquatic water park. But the season for all of them begins in 
March and ends in October." 
</P>
<P>
As for the noise, the Indians have some concerns, said Magante. Then again, 
there may be considerable tolerance since the reservation is already home to 
the Amago Raceway, which features go-cart and motorcycle events, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Orndoff, an Irvine businessman who first suggested the off-road park to 
the La Jolla Indians, told the commission in Sacramento on Friday that putting 
the vehicular playground on tribal lands would be easier and about 25% cheaper 
than working with a private owner. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said its North County location would be convenient for 
off-roaders in both San Diego and Orange counties. It is 55 minutes from 
downtown San Diego and 50 minutes from Irvine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the thick brush on the land could be seen as an advantage, he said. No 
off-roader would dare stray from official trails to tangle with the tough 
mesquite 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much brush up here, they couldn't tear it up," Magante said of the 
reservation. "The brush is so rough that they would be dissuaded from making 
their own path. They would tear their vehicles and themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Magante said the band would welcome a response from the state, which would pay 
for a new off-road riding park from its "green sticker" fund -- money collected 
from the registration of off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
If talks become serious, the entire tribe would have to approve a deal with the 
state, she said.

2 CHILDREN DIE AS HOUSE GOES UP 'LIKE TINDERBOX'; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: CHP OFFICERS WHO WERE PASSING BY SAVED ONE YOUNGSTER FROM THE FLAMES, 
WHICH ENGULFED THE ENCINITAS HOME BEFORE FIREFIGHTERS AT A STATION TWO HOUSES 
AWAY COULD REACT.

<P>
Two young cousins were killed shortly after midnight Friday when an Encinitas 
home erupted in flames, but two passing California Highway Patrol officers 
rescued a third child before they were beaten back by the smoke, heat and 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old woman, who lived in an upstairs unit and was unrelated to the two 
families that shared the downstairs quarters, escaped after hearing the shouts 
of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims' mothers, who are sisters, were not home when the fire broke 
out. They arrived more than an hour later to find firefighters preparing to 
enter the home to look for bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The wood-frame, 60-year-old home lacked smoke detectors and erupted "like a 
tinderbox," said Steve Marvin, a spokesman for the Encinitas Fire Protection 
District. Even though a neighborhood fire station is only two houses away, the 
home was fully engulfed in flames by the time firefighters could react to the 
dispatch call. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Monife Meyers, listed as 2 years old by the county coroner's office 
and 3 years old by the Encinitas Fire Department, and Ayikwei Scruggs, 15. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officers Annette Hirschi, 32, and Tom Greenstone, 29, were halfway through 
their overnight shift of cruising Interstate 5 between Del Mar and Carlsbad and 
had just left a gas station at Interstate 5 and Leucadia Boulevard, next door 
to the house, when the fire erupted at 12:01 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unit was pointed directly at the house while we were at the station," 
Hirschi said. "But there was nothing wrong at the time." 
</P>
<P>
As the partners drove across Leucadia Boulevard to the east side of I-5 to take 
the northbound on-ramp to the freeway, Greenstone looked over his left shoulder 
and noticed, in the clear night sky, smoke from where they had just come. "We 
thought maybe it was steam from an overheated car," Hirschi said. 
</P>
<P>
They backed off the on-ramp, returned to the gas station and saw the house next 
door ablaze. As Hirschi called her dispatcher to alert firefighters and then 
grabbed a fire extinguisher from the vehicle's trunk, Greenstone ran to the 
back of the house and saw a room fully engulfed in flames, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the front of the house and saw that a glass sliding door was 
open a crack. He opened it and fell on all fours to avoid the smoke, which had 
already filled the room down to within 18 inches of the floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hear two kids crying, wheezing and coughing," he said. "And I could 
make out two beds in the room. But I was totally overcome by the smoke, and I 
had to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Greenstone staggered back outdoors, and Hirschi, who had been yelling for 
anyone inside the home to get out, then entered the same room. "I was using my 
flashlight and saw a pair of white shoes," she said. "The girl stood up in bed, 
into the smoke, so I grabbed her down and got outside. The smoke was so thick I 
thought I was going to vomit." 
</P>
<P>
The girl rescued by Hirschi was identified as Ayida Aganaku, 10, the sister of 
the younger victim. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstone tried again to enter, but by then the ceiling had started to 
collapse, windows in the home were exploding, and the rush of oxygen turned the 
bedroom into an inferno. 
</P>
<P>
"The place was going up like a blowtorch," Greenstone said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing else we could have done," Hirschi said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Fletcher, the occupant of the upstairs room, who said she was awakened by 
the yelling and the officers' flashlights, escaped down an outside staircase. 
Firefighters from two doors away arrived soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up and it was really blurry. I wear contacts and I kept blinking; I 
kept trying to blink out the blurriness," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after she escaped, Fletcher did not realize that the haze that filled her 
one-bedroom apartment and the gas station lot next door was smoke from the 
fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who moved in two months ago, lost everything except her cat, Groucho, 
who apparently ran out the front door she had left open when she fled. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't own anything now except my car and my clothes that I was wearing when 
I was asleep," she said from the Encinitas motel where the American Red Cross 
had placed her. 
</P>
<P>
More than an hour after the fire, Ayikwei Scruggs' mother, Sharon Scruggs, and 
Monife Meyers' mother, whose first name was not known by authorities, arrived 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"They were walking up the street and they started yelling, 'That's my house! 
That's my house!' " said Lee Ann Donnelly, owner of the service station, who 
arrived at the scene shortly after the fire started. "A fireman or a sheriff's 
deputy grabbed onto them and held them." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it was unclear why the two mothers had left the three children 
alone at that hour, although there was one report that the two were returning 
home from San Diego after working as caterers. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said it was unusual for the women to arrive home later than 11 p.m. 
Friends told her the two had to work late Thursday night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the fire was out, firefighters entered the house and discovered first the 
body of the younger victim in the front bedroom, then the body of the 
15-year-old boy on the floor of the back bedroom, next to his bed. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the fire began when aging electrical wiring in a flexible 
metal conduit shorted and arced, igniting ceiling material in the back of the 
house, said Marvin, the Encinitas Fire Protection District spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the home had complained that they were having electrical problems, 
with breakers tripping, especially when it rained," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, a customer service representative for Arrowhead Drinking Water Co., 
said her apartment had a history of electrical problems, adding that she had no 
power for the first three days she lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Officials speculated that, even as quickly as the fire spread, the children's 
lives might have been saved if there had been smoke detectors in the home. 
</P>
<P>
"But, without them, they were doomed," Marvin said. 
</P>
<P>
The two mothers and the surviving 10-year-old stayed with friends Friday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the two sisters and their three children moved into the home in 
November, reportedly after their previous home was destroyed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew them well enough to talk to them over the fence, but they were quiet 
and kept to themselves," said Lori McGown, who lived next door and was awakened 
by the barking of her dog, then saw her own house cast in orange light from the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw how fast that house went up, like a torch, I didn't think anyone 
could have gotten out," McGown said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at the service station on the other side of the house said they knew 
the family only by sight, as members came over to buy soda from the vending 
machines. "We'd all 'oooh' and 'ahhh' over the baby," one employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the same home caught fire 10 to 15 years ago, but they did 
not remember the cause of that blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the home could not be reached for comment; the property was 
listed for sale for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The two CHP officers said they had mixed emotions about their rescue attempt -- 
thankful that one child had been saved but saddened by the deaths of two 
others. And they said they are not looking for personal credit. 
</P>
<P>
"Any other officer would have done the same thing," Greenstone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone would have done the same thing," Hirschi said.

RAMPAGE THAT KILLED ESCONDIDO SAILOR A MYSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
NAVY: INVESTIGATORS KNOW NO MOTIVE FOR THE SLAYINGS AND SUICIDE BY A PETTY 
OFFICER AT A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE BASE IN WASHINGTON STATE. 
</P>

<P>
Navy investigators Friday were trying to unravel a bizarre murder mystery 
involving three young sailors, including one San Diegan, at a top-secret 
nuclear submarine base. 
</P>
<P>
Shyam David Drizpaul, 23, a petty officer assigned to the weapons system of the 
Trident submarine Michigan, allegedly shot and killed two crew mates and one 
civilian, and seriously wounded another civilian before committing suicide 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those found shot was Drizpaul's roommate, David Alan Parker, 21, of 
Escondido. Parker, a radioman second class, had planned to surprise his parents 
in Escondido on Friday with a visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't understand. I guess the good Lord will provide answers," his 
mother, Ann Parker, said. "David was just beginning to really grow up and find 
his own way." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Parker relatives had met Drizpaul, but David Parker had spoken of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he mentioned his roommate, it was all positive. He said they were 
getting along fine, doing things together, and that everything was OK," said 
his father, Arthur Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed at the Naval Submarine Base, Bangor comes amid increased scrutiny 
of the Navy's psychological screening processes and has raised troubling 
questions about security at the highly sensitive compound on Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Also unclear is whether the slayings late Monday and early Tuesday might 
involve military secrets, since the only suspect had top-security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have any idea about the motive," said Lt. Cmdr. Keith 
Arterburn, a Navy spokesman. "We're looking at everything in this 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
He said a team of 35 to 40 Navy investigators -- including forensic specialists 
from San Diego and San Francisco -- was working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Arterburn said none of the three sailors from the Michigan had any disciplinary 
record. Autopsy results were pending, so it was not yet known whether drugs 
were a factor. 
</P>
<P>
However, Navy authorities acknowledged that they confiscated an unregistered 
pistol from Drizpaul but -- unaware of the murder on the base -- let him go 
just hours after his crew mates were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Drizpaul then went into nearby Bremerton, where he killed a pawn shop clerk and 
seriously wounded her brother in obtaining another gun, Bremerton Police Chief 
Delbert McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure, after having done his deed in Bangor, remorse set in and he 
believes there's only one thing to do -- kill himself -- and he had to get 
another weapon," McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
Drizpaul's body was found Wednesday in a motel room about 100 miles away in 
Hazel Dell, Wash. Parker's car was outside and a gun taken from the pawn shop 
was in the room, McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Parker, Drizpaul killed Fireman Recruit Scott Anthony Seely, 18, of 
North Ridgeville, Ohio, and pawn shop clerk Julie Lynn Tuscher, 24, of 
Bremerton. 
</P>
<P>
Tuscher's brother, Allan Michaels, 28, remained hospitalized in serious 
condition with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
In Escondido, Parker's parents struggled with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there has got to be a reason," said Ann Parker, his mother. "It's just 
getting real to me right now. I'm just numb." 
</P>
<P>
David Alan Parker, the second youngest of the couple's four boys, would have 
come home Friday for a two-week vacation. He was eager to meet his new nephew, 
Christian Nicolas, who was born two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But he had another reason to come home. On Feb. 3, his younger brother, Doug, 
will be installed as an official of a local Masonic youth group that all four 
Parkers have taken part in. The four brothers and their parents had planned to 
attend the ceremony, in which Doug will become master counselor of the Agate 
chapter of DeMolay, which has 75 members. 
</P>
<P>
The family has decided to go ahead with the ceremony, Ann said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, an athletic 6-foot-2, enjoyed basketball, graduated from Mira Mesa High 
School in June, 1986, and joined the Navy the following September. From the 
beginning, Parker loved Navy life and decided to make it his career. And he 
spoke to his parents of eventually applying for officer candidate school, a 
16-week program. 
</P>
<P>
"David was so proud of being in the Navy, particularly being on a Trident 
submarine -- this was the highlight of his life," Ann Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
David Parker, she said, also enjoyed the camaraderie of the military man, and 
he liked the other crew members. He had spoken of the other crew member killed, 
Scott Seely. 
</P>
<P>
"David mentioned the name Scott. He liked his barracks -- he liked the guys," 
said Ann Parker. She struggled to remember exactly what her son had said about 
his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"You try and reach in the back of your mind and remember," she said, her voice 
trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
For Parker's family, his death is a devastating mystery. Arthur Parker, who had 
been in the Navy 22 years before he retired in 1980, has asked to see the 
Navy's investigation report when it is released. 
</P>
<P>
"I just would like to know what they find out," he said. "I gave up on rumors 
and speculation." 
</P>
<P>
But Parker's friends and family say even the knowledge of what happened will 
not ease the pain of their loss. 
</P>
<P>
"He had everything going for him, everything in the world -- it chokes me up," 
said Bob Catalano, the adult leader of the Agate chapter of DeMolay. "It's just 
such a tragedy for a young man with his whole life in front of him to be blown 
away like that." 
</P>
<P>
The killings were discovered late Tuesday morning when the three sailors failed 
to report for duty, Arterburn said. 
</P>
<P>
A room-by-room search of bachelor enlisted quarters uncovered Seely's body in a 
television lounge. Parker was found dead in his bed. Both men had been shot in 
the head between 11:30 p.m. and midnight Monday, Arterburn said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Drizpaul had been stopped by gate security around 2:45 a.m. Tuesday 
while trying to enter the base. He was held on suspicion of drunk driving and 
an unregistered 9-millimeter Llama pistol was confiscated, Arterburn said. He 
said ballistics tests were being conducted to determine if that weapon killed 
Parker and Seely. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers did everything according to procedure," he said, adding that 
Drizpaul was turned over to his duty officer and told to report to superiors in 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Because of tight secrecy at the Trident base, little information was available 
about Drizpaul, a Guyana native who moved to Milwaukee with his family 15 years 
ago. He became an American citizen in 1980 and joined the Navy in 1987.

Assigned to the Michigan in May, 1988, Drizpaul was a fire control technician 
who repaired and maintained some of the computer systems used in the Trident 
sub's missile-launching sequence. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy maintains that personnel in such sensitive positions are rigorously 
screened and are suspended if there are any indications of drug abuse, 
emotional instability or financial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said that Drizpaul was not under any such suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The case comes just six months after another Bangor sailor was arrested in the 
slaying of an elderly couple off base. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's psychological screening process came under the most scrutiny last 
year after investigators contended that a suicidal sailor triggered an 
explosion that killed 46 other sailors aboard the battleship Iowa. But many 
have rejected that explanation for the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Navy psychologists sharply criticized the screening process in the 
December issue of the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, Lt. Cmdr. Douglas Derrer and Lt. Michael Gelles, said sailors 
exhibit more severe personality disorders today than in previous years and that 
those with such emotional disturbances seem to be "more dangerous to themselves 
and others."

DROWN STARTS CAMPAIGN BY BACKING AWAY FROM DUFFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Drown, an assistant sheriff in the San Diego County Sheriff's Department 
and the chosen candidate of Sheriff John Duffy, opened his campaign for sheriff 
Friday by distancing himself from what he called Duffy's "unique" style of 
leadership, especially Duffy's constant sparring with the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"When John Duffy leaves office at the end of this year, his own unique and 
individual style of leadership will also leave," Drown said at a news 
conference at the County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's any big secret," he said. "The relationship between the 
Board of Supervisors, the CAO's (Chief Administrative Officer's) office and 
John Duffy has been strained. I would prefer that we not work under strained 
relationships. My style is not necessarily one of confrontation but rather one 
of being communicative and cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Drown, whose intention to run for sheriff was announced by Duffy last month, 
joins three other candidates -- Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, former San 
Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler and Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of them is a formidable opponent," said Drown, a 20-year veteran of 
the San Diego Sheriff's Department. But, he added, "I know this organization. I 
know the people. I think that's a significant advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Drown introduced a brief, four-part platform "for the 1990s" that focused on 
reducing drug-related crimes, easing crowding in the county's jails, addressing 
the needs of crime victims and improving communication with the public. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to respond to the idea, espoused by two county supervisors, of creating a 
separate Department of Corrections to run the jails, Drown indicated that he 
wants that responsibility to remain with the Sheriff's Department. But he said 
he supports using correctional deputies instead of deputy sheriffs to staff the 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we should be splitting our energies . . . (with) the sheriff 
entrenched in one camp and the Board of Supervisors in the other camp and the 
jail in the middle," he said. All but "a very small handful" of California's 58 
counties let their sheriffs run the jails, he said. "It's not so much a matter 
of who's operating the jail, but are the jails receiving the proper amount of 
attention they need to operate in a professional manner?" 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he feels Duffy's endorsement will help or hurt him, Drown said: 
"I've certainly talked to an awful lot of people who have said, 'I like John 
Duffy. I think John Duffy was a good sheriff.' For those people, I think his 
endorsement will certainly help me. I've talked to some people who have not 
said those types of things about him. But I would hope that everybody would 
judge me on who I am and what I'm saying, rather than who John Duffy is."

PESSIMISTIC ESCONDIDO OPTIMISTS SHUT RECYCLING YARD; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIC AFFAIRS: SLOPPY BOOKKEEPING IN PAST LEADS TO THE DEMISE OF A 
CASH-FOR-TRASH CENTER AFTER 18 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After officers of the Noon Optimist Club toted up the financial facts for their 
recycling yard in Escondido this week, pessimism was the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only thing we could do," club president Stan Oleksy said with a 
sigh. "We had to shut it down." 
</P>
<P>
The salvage yard at 1180 W. Washington was the chief source of club income for 
18 years, financing dozens of Optimist projects. For its customers, the dimes 
and dollars that the yard paid for paper, plastic and aluminum cans went to 
youth groups and schools to finance special events and recreational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The club issued a two-page statement -- half eulogy, half obituary -- to 
announce that the yard would no longer be operated by the Noon Optimist Club 
and will be closed until another operator is found. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot Oleksy could find in the dark picture were calls from four 
companies seeking to buy, lease or operate the salvage center. Two club 
members, Alan Biery and Ron Haines, have been appointed to negotiate with the 
interested groups. 
</P>
<P>
The club first discovered that it had problems with its recycling center early 
last year and tried to stabilize the operation by firing the manager, Ted 
Vessels, who had operated the center with little interference from club members 
since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-miss bookkeeping and missing records caused auditors brought in to 
balance the books to throw up their hands in frustration. The recycling center 
did most of its business in small cash amounts that accountants found 
impossible to trace. 
</P>
<P>
Oleksy said there was no evidence to support early concerns that there might 
have been misappropriations of the Optimists' share of the center profits. But 
he said there was no evidence that proper payroll deductions were made for 
workers or that company contributions to state agencies were ever paid. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the club is responsible for the lapses in the operation of the 
recycling center is a matter that the club's attorney -- and probably a few 
government agencies -- is looking into, Oleksy said. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, when the club began to oversee the recycling center's operations, 
implementing a new payroll system and a proper accounting procedure, the 
center's financial picture has gone from bad to worse, Oleksy said. 
</P>
<P>
At the first of last year, the center had $104,000, but, by June 30, it posted 
a $40,000 loss. By August, another $30,000 in red ink was added; by Jan. 10, 
"there was just enough money left to pay off the workers." 
</P>
<P>
Club members had hoped to make a financial turnaround by keeping the center 
open and accepting "donations" of recyclable materials instead of paying for 
the materials. But the trickle of donations was not enough, Oleksy said, "and 
we weren't making enough to pay even a skeleton crew and pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
The center's death sentence came Tuesday when an Optimist committee gathered to 
discuss alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't any," Oleksy said. Although the center had been making a modest, 
almost marginal profit since club officers took over its operation last August, 
it was too late to build back up the $100,000-$150,000 operating fund that the 
center required for its daily buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
"Continued operation of the center was not a viable option," he said. 
"Financially, it was utterly impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Oleksy now must find another way to earn money to support the club's charitable 
programs, which include more than a dozen youth activities, the Blind Olympics, 
Meals on Wheels, special school recognition programs and other senior citizen 
aids. The president said that members are kicking around fund-raising 
possibilities. The one he tends to favor would have club members collect 
recyclables to be sold at someone else's salvage yard. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, we could get the income without all the hassle of running the 
business," he said.

PAUL NEWMAN GIVES $50,000 FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Actor Paul Newman's success in selling salad dressings and spaghetti sauces is 
benefiting, to the tune of $50,000, a nonprofit organization that plans to 
build low-income housing in San Diego and Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Newman's food company, Newman's Own, has donated $275,000 to Habitat for 
Humanity International, earmarking $50,000 of that to go toward the Jimmy 
Carter Work Project, to be conducted by the organization's San Diego division. 
</P>
<P>
The project hopes to build 100 houses in Tijuana and seven in Southeast San 
Diego during the week of June 17-23, project director Jeff Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
The houses will be sold at cost, with interest-free 15- to 20-year mortgages, 
to low-income families. The future homeowners will typically invest hundreds of 
hours in construction work to build their houses, as well as those of others, 
and promise to pay back about $30,000 in construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make the issue of affordable housing a matter of conscience," 
Snider said. "This is a one-week event intended to bring attention to the need 
for affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
The project will cost $2 million, Snider said, and the $50,000 "goes a long way 
towards that goal." Half of the money has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 volunteers will be needed for the project, to build houses, act as 
support and provide meals and temporary housing for workers, Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time Newman has donated to Habitat for Humanity, an 
organization with 445 projects in the United States and 81 projects in 27 other 
countries. All profits of Newman's Own are given to charities. Last year, the 
company gave $7 million to more than 300 charities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat for Humanity in San Diego may be reached at (619) 233-7551.

PADRES GET LOCKED IN FOR SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres, partly because of optimism but mostly because they say it's 
necessary, decided to ignore the advice of the baseball owners' Player 
Relations Committee by finalizing spring-training plans Friday, booking hotel 
rooms for their major league roster and staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," said Jack McKeon, Padre manager and vice president/baseball 
operations, "we're treating it as business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, interim executive director of the PRC, advised clubs last 
week to delay making arrangements until the owners meet Feb. 9 in Chicago. If 
there is not an imminent collective bargaining agreement between the Major 
League Players Assn. and PRC at the time of the meeting, owners will decide 
whether to stage a lockout that could delay the start of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
But the Padres have booked hotel rooms for major league players and other 
personnel at the Park Inn International, formerly the Days Inn, for the entire 
spring-training schedule. Trucks have been scheduled to deliver the equipment 
to their facilities in Yuma, Ariz., on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, McKeon and the Padres are well aware of the distinct possibility of 
a lockout, but they also know there is potential disaster if they don't make 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres already were scrambling for hotel rooms for their minor league 
players and staff because of the closing of the 260-room Stardust Hotel. And if 
they had delayed, they could have found themselves homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still hopeful everything will work out," McKeon said, "but because of 
the room shortage, we've had to go ahead and make our plans just like usual." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, although the Players Assn. has sent memos to members warning against 
putting deposits down on housing and making plane reservations, Padre player 
representative Dennis Rasmussen expects few to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us are coming in anyway," said Rasmussen, whose off-season 
home is in Omaha, Neb. "Since Yuma is just three hours away from San Diego, 
most of the guys are planning to come in and set up their housing for the 
season. A lot of guys already live in San Diego, anyway, and for guys like me 
who are dying to get to warm weather, we don't want to wait." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also learned Friday that their payroll will increase by at least 
$670,000, and as much as $1.615 million, when salary-arbitration figures were 
exchanged between the club and their four eligible players: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Catcher Benito Santiago, as promised, requested the largest arbitration 
award in Padre history, $1.25 million. The Padres countered with a $750,000 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi is seeking $685,000, a $285,000 raise. The Padres 
offered $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third baseman Mike Pagliarulo filed for $645,000, a $95,000 raise. The 
Padres offered $550,000, a $25,000 cut. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mark Grant filed for $475,000, a $320,000 raise. The Padres offered 
$310,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll sit down next week and see if we can settle the differences," McKeon 
said. "I think we can. If not, it's all a roll of the dice, and we'll see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres and the players are unable to reach agreements, they'll settle 
their differences in front of an impartial arbitrator in hearings scheduled 
Feb. 1-Feb. 21 in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago's case figures to the most difficult to settle. It's the largest 
difference the Padres have had with a player. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres filed for $750,000, sources say, primarily because of the recent 
signing of catcher Terry Steinbach of Oakland. Steinbach, who like Santiago 
also has three years of major league service, this week signed a two-year, 
$1.8-million contract that will pay him a $100,000 signing bonus and a $700,000 
in 1990 and a $1-million salary in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres say that Steinbach's contract computes to $750,000 for 1990, 
averaging his signing bonus over two seasons. Santiago and his agent, Scott 
Boras, compute Steinbach's salary to being an average of $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there also is the difference in Santiago's talents and 
Steinbach's: 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach is a two-time All-Star who helped his team to two World Series; 
Santiago has superior offensive statistics, hitting 13 more homers and driving 
in 40 more runs while winning two Gold Glove and two Silver Slugger awards. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can demonstrate that Benito is worthy of the money we're seeking," 
Boras said.

BOOSTER CLUB MEMBER DEFENDS GROUP'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of the Huntington Beach (High School) Football Booster Club, I find 
myself always a little perturbed by the way "we" seem to come off in almost 
every article written that mentions our suit against the (Southern Section) 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
Our Booster Club is made up of intelligent, caring, supportive parents who felt 
that a terrible wrong had been done to 66 young men who had set their sights on 
a (Southern Section) championship from the first day of spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
While I applaud (Southern Section commissioner) Stan Thomas' proposal to have 
"in-service" sessions with the booster clubs so that everyone involved is made 
aware of the rules, I would point out that the responsibility for informing 
parents and players is in place in the (Southern Section), just not carried 
out. As for the "control" issue, I believe boosters know what the function of 
the club is -- financial and moral support. 
</P>
<P>
One change I think would work is to initiate a committee of booster club 
members who attend (Southern Section) general meetings after attending their 
own league meetings. These representatives would be able to voice their 
opinions on issues at hand but have no voting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Parents don't need to be threatened with expulsion from the (Southern Section) 
or punished in any other way, because that will not silence the outcry nor 
solve the problem. We see problems and want them solved.

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MOLLE LEADS IRVINE PAST DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Molle's domination of the third quarter helped lead Irvine High School to 
a 55-50 South Coast League victory over Dana Hills Friday night at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Molle, the only Irvine player to score in the third quarter, had 13 of his 
game-high 30 points in the quarter. Dana Hills had five. 
</P>
<P>
After being held to seven points and making only two of nine shots in the first 
half, Molle, who averages about 23 point a game, made his move. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 26-24, the Vaqueros (10-11 overall and 2-3 in league play) were led 
back by Molle, who made four of four shots in the third quarter. Molle drove to 
the basket, pulled up for jumpers in the lane, made two free throws and hit a 
three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dana Hills (14-6, 2-3) was stuck in low gear. With 3 minutes 8 
seconds remaining in the quarter, the Dolphins finally scored when guard Keith 
Barnett made one of two free throws. Dana Hills' made its first field goal, a 
jumper by Jason Hinchman to cut the Irvine lead to 37-29, came with 50 seconds 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We just just totally lost our poise for a minute or two and they got the 
lead," Dana Hills Coach Tom Riach said. "When they get the lead, they are a 
really good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 37-31, at the start of the fourth quarter, Dana Hills rallied. But 
again it was Molle, a 6-foot-5 junior forward, who held fast. Molle, who is 88% 
from the free throw line (second in the county), made all 10 of his attempts in 
the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly wasn't the guy we wanted to foul," Riach said. 
</P>
<P>
But few other Irvine players were missing, either, as the Vaqueros made 16 of 
18 free throws in the quarter to hold off the Dolphins. 
</P>

SEA VIEW LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
ESTANCIA PUTS FINISHING TOUCH ON TUSTIN'S MISERABLE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a tough time for Tustin High School's basketball team, which started 
the week ranked third in the county but lost to Corona del Mar Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't get any better Friday night, when the Tillers fell to Estancia, 
60-55, to remain winless at home in Sea View League games. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia got 30 points from senior guard Augustin Heredia, who jumped over, 
leaned into and layed all over Tustin defenders before laying the Tillers (15-4 
overall, 2-2 in league play) to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia continually drew fouls, stepping to the free-throw line 10 times and 
making all 10 shots. He also had two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia scored 10 of Estancia's 20 fourth-quarter points to help the Eagles 
(11-7, 2-2) come from four points down, 44-40, at the start of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good one," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said of Heredia. "This is a young 
team. We've got one senior who carries us." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as if Tustin carried Heredia. 
</P>
<P>
One of his two old-fashioned three-point plays came with about four minutes to 
play. It was a 17-foot jumper he sank while balancing on the shoulder of Tustin 
guard David Beilstein. Beilstein was called for the foul and Heredia sank the 
free throw to put Estancia ahead, 50-49. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia took a 54-52 lead on Heredia's jumper in the lane with just under two 
minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin had a chance to tie when Son Ly fouled Clayton Thomas, but Thomas (14 
points) missed both free throws with 42 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia pushed the ball up court through the pressure and dished to Torrey 
Hammond for the layup to put Estancia on top, 56-52. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Phuong Tran countered with one of his four three-point baskets to cut 
the lead to 56-55 with 18 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But after Estancia inbounded the ball, Jason Moore was called for an 
intentional foul for grabbing Heredia. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia sank both free throws to give the Eagles a 58-55 lead with 11 seconds 
to play. He was fouled once more, on the inbounds play, and again sank both 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia had jumped to a 7-0 lead, holding Tustin scoreless until 2 1/2 minutes 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams played intense man-to-man defense throughout. Tustin had trouble 
penetrating Estancia's defense. Center Brian Reider hit a couple of baskets 
inside midway through the second quarter to loosen up Tustin's offense. 
Beilstein hit back-to-back three-point baskets in the Tillers' 14-5 run to get 
them back in the game and end the half trailing, 25-20. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin took its biggest lead, 30-26, on the strength of its half-court trap 
three minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Win or lose, I don't care," O'Brien said. "We just played hard. I'm just so 
pleased with the way we responded." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Fuerbringer had 11 points and Paul McDaniel 10 for Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor 55, Saddleback 49 -- Eddie Martinez and Craig DeBusk scored 12 
points to lead visiting Newport Harbor (13-6, 2-2). Andra McFarlane scored 14 
and Elton Moore had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Saddleback (13-8, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 78, University 63 -- Jeff Jackson scored 21 points and Warren 
Johnson 17 to lead visiting Corona del Mar (13-6, 4-0). Bryan Smith scored 15 
for University (5-12, 0-4).

EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
LOS ALAMITOS ALONE IN FIRST AFTER DEFEATING ESPERANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After watching his team win its previous two games by a total of three points, 
Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks was relieved after the Griffins beat Esperanza, 
77-54, Friday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to come back and get a 23-point win after those close 
ones," Brooks said. "It's coming together for us. Earlier in the season, we 
weren't playing hard the whole game. We would get a 12- or 15-point lead and 
let the team back in. We needed to be more cold-hearted." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins were just that against Esperanza. They built a 16-2 lead in the 
first quarter and let Esperanza no closer than eight in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked our intensity," Brooks said. "This is a sign of a mature team." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks also was pleased with the maturity of sophomore guard Jason Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a 6-foot-4 forward, scored 24 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to 
help the Griffins (15-5) take sole possession of first place in the Empire 
League at 5-0. Esperanza dropped to 12-9 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
With Robert Conlisk, the team's 6-11 center and leading scorer, struggling with 
foul problems, Cunningham took over in the fourth quarter, scoring 11 points 
and getting six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's scored 21, 30, nine and 24 in his last four games and has been averaging 
in double figures on the boards," Brooks said. "He's been playing very well for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
"He's starting to understand the offense and what's available to him when 
(opponents) double-team Robert. He's taking advantage of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza Coach Mark Hill said Cunningham took advantage of the Aztecs' poor 
weakside defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a horrible job rotating our defense," Hill said. "There's no reason why 
he should have had that many points. It was bad defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs weren't exactly sparkling on offense either. They made 17 of 46 
shots and committed 20 turnovers, including eight in the first quarter. Joe 
Foss was the Aztecs' only weapon, scoring 24 points and pulling down 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't shoot well from the perimeter and we had too many turnovers," Hill 
said. "They were silly things, like not taking care of the ball. It's all 
concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Loara 85, El Dorado 82 -- Tes Whitlock scored 37 points to lead host Loara 
(14-3, 3-2). Whitlock made 11 of 19 shots, including nine of 13 from 
three-point range. The Golden Hawks (11-8, 2-3) had a chance to tie the game at 
the buzzer, but Gary Smith missed a three-point field goal from the top of the 
key. 
</P>
<P>
Katella 80, Cypress 71 -- Forward Kevin Carlson scored 33 points for host 
Katella (5-12, 1-4). Cypress is 7-12, 0-5.

EDISON LOSES LEAD, FALLS TO OCEAN VIEW 
</P>

<P>
Another game, another collapse and Edison High School sank a little further in 
the Sunset League standings. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, the Chargers couldn't hold a fourth-quarter 
lead. Ocean View rallied from a nine-point deficit to win, 50-48, on two free 
throws by Darren Ernst with three seconds left Friday night at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Edison two games out of first place, while Ocean View moved 
into sole possession of first place, one game ahead of Marina. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great team effort," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. "They did a 
good job of taking everything away from us for three quarters, but we pulled 
together at the end. This is a big, big win." 
</P>
<P>
For Edison, it was an all-too-familiar way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Chargers had a nine-point lead against Marina entering the 
fourth quarter only to lose, 61-55. On Friday, all that changed was the 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the collapse was foul trouble. Center Bill Martineau and 
forward Steve Thobe each picked up his fourth foul early in the final quarter. 
Thobe eventually fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (13-6 overall, 2-2 in league play) also were without Brandon 
Jessie for part of the fourth quarter. Jessie missed more than two minutes 
because of leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (12-6, 4-0) trailed, 40-31, after the third quarter but held the 
Chargers scoreless for the first three minutes of the fourth quarter. During 
that time, Ocean View scored nine points to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Martin (13 points) scored five points and Marcel TenBerge (13 points) had 
four during the run. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any problems in the fourth quarter until this week," Edison 
Coach Jon Borchert said. "Ocean View just executed better than we did in the 
fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Especially during the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie returned to the game to score five unanswered points. His three-point 
field goal gave the Chargers a 48-42 lead with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers made nothing but mistakes from then on. They missed three shots 
and turned the ball over three times down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and freshman Jim Harris made back-to-back three-point field goals to tie 
the score, 48-48, with 1:08 left. 
</P>
<P>
With 28 seconds left, the Chargers had the ball in the right hands, Jessie's, 
who scored a game-high 18 points. However, Jessie missed a 15-foot jump shot 
with eight seconds left and, in the scramble for the ball, he fouled Ernst with 
three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst made both free throws. They were his only points in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 68, Marina 65 -- The Barons trailed, 65-64, with 30 seconds 
left, but Derrick Corcoran made a three-point field goal and a free throw to 
give Fountain Valley (8-10, 2-2) the victory at Marina. Corcoran finished with 
23 points. Cherokee Parks had 21 points and 13 rebounds for Marina (11-8, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 70, Westminster 63 -- Scott Jahr scored 24 and Mustapha Abdi 
17 for Huntington Beach. Mark Murphy scored 17 for Westminster (5-11, 0-4).

<P>
With the game on the line Friday night, Troy High School's basketball team came 
through at the line. 
</P>
<P>
Troy (7-9 overall, 2-2 in the Freeway League) made 13 of 18 free throws in the 
fourth quarter to score a 63-59 victory over visiting Sunny Hills (5-11, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice for a change because we haven't shot free throws very well all 
season long," Troy Coach Bill Morris said. "It was also the first night we've 
been consistent for all four quarters. We've always had one bad quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' first two quarters weren't pretty, but at least they stayed 
close. Sunny Hills held a 32-25 lead at the half, but Troy, which had shot 30% 
from the field in the first half, connected on 11 of 22 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Chris Inman, who led Troy with 17 points off the bench, hit a 
three-pointer late in the third quarter to give Troy its first lead of the 
game, 40-39. 
</P>
<P>
Inman also made five free throws in the final quarter. Guard Mike Abbott made 
four free throws down the stretch and forwards Jermaine Butler and Richard 
Wesley made two each in the fourth quarter to help put Sunny Hills away. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams had traded baskets to tie the score at 49-49, Troy's Jim 
Falletta hit a jumper with two minutes left in the fourth quarter to give the 
Warriors the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley then hit a three-pointer to give Troy a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills guard Dominic Carnesi hit a pair of three-pointers in the final 
minute, but it was too late. Carnesi led all scorers with 25 points, including 
three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills wasn't nearly as effective from the foul line down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Brett Mitchelson (12 points, 11 rebounds) missed two 
free throws, David Ragsdale (eight points, 15 rebounds) missed the front ends 
of a pair of one-and-ones, and Kenny Overby also missed the first shot of a 
one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
There was one exception. Carnesi, who was 11 of 13 from the line in Sunny 
Hills' 58-40 victory over Buena Park Wednesday night, made all eight of his 
free throws Friday night. STUART MATTHEWS Buena Park 63, La Habra 57 -- 
Prentiss Johnson hit four of five free throws down the stretch to lead host 
Buena Park (8-9, 3-1). La Habra dropped to 5-12, 1-3. Fullerton 76, Sonora 69 
-- Procopio Misa had 22 points and Ladd Brunner 19 to lead visiting Fullerton 
(6-11, 3-1). Anthony Choe scored 18 for Sonora (5-13, 0-4).

<P>
Orange High School's 2-0 victory over host Laguna Hills in a boys' soccer match 
Friday helped clear up what would have been a cloudy picture. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Orange's record to 11-0-2 overall and 9-0 in the Pacific 
Coast League. Laguna Hills, trying to gain a tie for the league lead, fell to 
14-3, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make that third-round game (against Orange Feb. 7) mean 
something," Laguna Hills Coach Scott Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Panthers strengthened their hold on first place. 
</P>
<P>
Tres Martin had 12 saves in recording his seventh shutout of the season for 
Orange, ranked second in the Southern Section 2-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to clinch league, go undefeated and beat them here," said Orange 
halfback Ricky Heimer, who scored his ninth goal of the season. With 16 minutes 
remaining, Heimer scored on a rebound of Tim Huhn's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn accounted for the first goal when he broke free down the left sideline and 
beat Laguna Hills goalkeeper Kirk Brown 13 minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The assist went to Heimer, who predicted afterward: "We're going to win CIF," 
he said. "Righetti (ranked No. 1), forget it. They may as well go home." 
</P>
<P>
For 50 minutes it looked as if both teams would go home empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be patient in a game like this," Heimer said. "If you wait for 
it, it will come." 
</P>
<P>
Said Martin: "The key was they (Orange's forwards) just kept on pushing it up 
field and we got those breakaways." 
</P>
<P>
Martin and Justin Zayas, a 5-foot-6 fullback, anchored a defense that shut down 
Laguna Hills' leading scorer, Brian Slayback. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take many shots that he (Martin) had to make great saves on," 
Orange Coach Ed Carrillo said. "And with Justin (Zayas) in back, we can attack 
and push harder." DENNIS KAISER In other Pacific Coast League matches:

DISCOVERY: COLLECTORS THRIFT SHOP

<P>
Even Fred Sanford would be in awe. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors Thrift Shop in Santa Ana is like a garage sale on steroids. It is 
housed in a 93-year-old, two-story converted home that has 15 rooms, three 
bathrooms, four hallways and a fireplace. It also spills out onto a courtyard, 
a patio, a back yard, two garages and a long driveway. The shop is an eclectic 
roundup of bric-a-brac from antique to new, Ming Dynasty to Art Deco, the Coke 
generation to the Pepsi generation. It is a cache that true raiders of the lost 
objets d'art love to invade. 
</P>
<P>
It is an adventure in shopping that can easily take four hours to even make a 
dent. Grown men and women can frequently be heard uttering that familiar 
exclamation: "Wow." And why not? There are things to touch, things to pick up 
and admire, things to peer into. 
</P>
<P>
There are stately grandfather clocks, whimsical cuckoo clocks and delicate 
pocket watches; there are cannons, tomahawks and samurai swords; an 1894 carved 
walnut Victorian reclining 
</P>
<P>
chair, a 1925 barber chair, and a 1910 fainting couch. There are 1920 gas 
stoves, 1938 electrical stoves and an 1889 wood-burning stove. Here too, you 
can find the Edison cylinders of the late 1800s (precursors to vinyl records), 
plus all kinds of other records, including 78s, 45s, 33 1/3s and a 1920 Philco 
radio/phonograph on which to play them. 
</P>
<P>
If that's not enough, there are such knickknacks as teaspoons, blue glass 
dishes, Nippon china, leather sewing tools, date nails, square nails, American 
Indian jewelry and piggy banks. There are odds and ends like mailboxes, 
toilets, fire hydrants, water pumps, an 1850 one-ton solid brass cash register 
that requires three people to lift, old plows, gum machines, an old PBX board 
complete with cords, washboards, wringer washers and even a brass-and-copper 
diving helmet, circa 1905. 
</P>
<P>
The thriving business began in 1958 when Artemio Paz opened a small vacuum 
repair/antique shop in La Mirada. Growing restless after eight years, he sold 
the vacuum-repair half of the enterprise and relocated the antique store to 
Brea, where he stayed for seven years before moving once again, this time to 
Santa Ana. However, when an accident in 1987 left him with a head injury, Paz 
cut back to working part time, leaving his eldest son Manuel to tend the family 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Paz was an artist before joining the business -- his most famous 
work is the 540 feet of sculpture outside the Page Museum in Los Angeles. "I 
still have time for my sculpting at night, but this store is my father's life, 
so I want to help keep it going," he says. "Besides, the store is a lot of fun, 
and I enjoy talking to the people who come in here. Over the years my father 
has built up quite a loyal clientele." 
</P>
<P>
Loyal barely covers it. According to the senior Paz, customers periodically 
return from as far north as Seattle and San Francisco, as far south as San 
Diego and as far east as New York City. The shop draws everyone from the 
curious to the informed, from first-time visitors to longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the quaint country store with hedges trimmed into the shapes of 
wild animals, the row of 1900s claw-foot bathtubs and a fierce-looking totem 
pole, all looming conspicuously in the front courtyard, can make even the 
unadventurous feel like Indiana Jones for having discovered the treasures 
within its walls. DALLAS M. JACKSONHours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday,

Santa Claus, in the form of the State Board of Equalization, paid a visit to 
county cities in December, leaving $29.1 million in sales and use tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The single largest allocation, $3.86 million, went to Anaheim -- 13% of the 
total amount sent to the cities. Although Tustin received the 10th largest 
amount, its $33.38 was easily the highest per capita among the cities. Villa 
Park, as usual, received the smallest total allocation, but Seal Beach had the 
lowest per capita amount, $3.49. 
</P>
<P>
The $29.1 million sent to Orange County was higher than the comparable figures 
for Riverside, San Diego and San Bernardino Counties, but only about one-third 
of the Los Angeles County allocation. 
</P>
<P>
The figures below, with the cities listed in order of their percentage of the 
total allocation, represent the first advance payment for the fourth quarter 
plus the cleanup payment for the third quarter 1989.

Houses have addresses, but boats -- like children -- have names. And for some, 
choosing a boat name is more difficult than naming a baby. 
</P>
<P>
When Paul and Jeanie Lowry bought their 35-foot powerboat, it took them two 
years to name it. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't going to name this boat until we came up with something different 
and clever," recalls Jeanie Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
But in the pun-filled world of boat names, that is not easy, as the Lowrys soon 
discovered. The Lowrys finally settled upon Conjeanie L I (read that "congenial 
one" and it helps to know that Jeanie Lowry is as congenial as they come). 
</P>
<P>
"Once we thought of it I was sure that was it," Jeanie Lowry says. "We've had 
the boat for 15 years now. Everybody loves the name." 
</P>
<P>
And if you like Conjeanie L I, you'll love Cost A Yacht More, Sloop de Jour, 
Sol Searcher, Slippery When Wet, Priority Won, Devocean, Seaducer and the 
hundreds of other personal, professional and sometimes unprintable puns. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that people named boats for their wives," says Robert Kline, who 
has been painting on boat names for 16 years. "But more and more people are 
beginning to name their boats after their professions. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most common doctor names is Pair A Docs (for a boat owned by two 
doctors)." 
</P>
<P>
Other doctor names, according to Kline, include Laughing Gasser (an 
anesthesiologist); Jack of Hearts (heart surgeon); Bone Bender (chiropractor) 
and Tooth Fairy (dentist). 
</P>
<P>
Other memorable names, according to Kline, include Defense Rests (an attorney); 
Loan Shark (a banker) and Sails Calls (a salesman). 
</P>
<P>
"Originality is the key," says Kline. "The big thing is they don't want what 
everyone else has. They want something different. They want to stand out from 
the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
When Fred Martin and his partner Jim Moore, both former sailors, got ready to 
name their new 37-foot powerboat, they were determined to come up with 
something that expressed the guilt they felt at switching from sail to power. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like traitors," says Martin. "One of the names we considered was 
Benedict Arnold, but that was too long." 
</P>
<P>
Martin and Moore settled on Turncoat. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in boating get it right away," says Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Once boat owners have chosen a name, they call a professional such as Kline, 
one of half a dozen people in Orange County who specialize in boat lettering. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Kline, paint names on using a stencil, while others paint free-hand, 
without stencils. Other boat letterers use computer-generated vinyl letters, 
often accompanied by color graphics. 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific Signcenter in Dana Point, owner Bob Smith uses two computers to 
produce letters, logos and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"We got in this business four years ago because we found a market that needed 
to be filled," Smith says. "Most lettering was done by painting at that time." 
</P>
<P>
One of his most challenging jobs, Smith says, involved creating and applying 
three large killer whales -- all done in vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
Kline, a graphic artist who estimates that he has done 8,000 to 9,000 boat 
names, also uses a computer, but still does hand-cut vinyl lettering as well as 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
For Kline, one of his most challenging -- and expensive -- jobs involved 
applying two 15-foot-long names in 22-karat gold leaf on each side of a 72-foot 
sailboat. The cost was $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most boat names, however, cost substantially less, Kline adds. Depending upon 
the number and size of the letters, a job could cost as little as $100 or as 
much as $1,000. Pacific Signcenter even produces do-it-yourself kits that allow 
boat owners to order names by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increasing popularity of computer-generated vinyl lettering, there 
are still a few people, such as Ron Nawrocki, who specialize in free-hand 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are getting into vinyl letters and spray on letters," says 
Nawrocki, who has been painting boat names for 11 years. "Younger people are 
getting into stencil and stick-on letters. I only know of two other guys 
besides me who do free-hand lettering (in this area)." 
</P>
<P>
Nawrocki, who runs Ron's Yacht Lettering in Fountain Valley, learned 
sign-painting from his grandfather. Later, he began to specialize in yachts and 
now he estimates that he does about 12 to 15 boat names a week in the summer 
and about half that many in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is still a big call for hand-lettering," he says. "The vinyl 
letters and the spray-on letters never have the warmth of the hand-lettered 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what method they use, most yacht letterers work on boats in the 
water, where finding a steady place to stand or sit is often difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Most powerboats have swim steps," says Kline, "and I work from there. But if 
there is no swim step . . . a lot of those I do upside down (by leaning over 
the transom of the boat)." 
</P>
<P>
Luke Griffin, whose Corona company, Trim It, does computer-generated letters 
and graphics, recalls hanging over the side of a dinghy to do one job and 
actually standing in water up to his nose to do another. 
</P>
<P>
What is really tough, says Nawrocki, is being perched in a dinghy, painting a 
name, when a passing boat zooms by throwing a wake that leaves you bouncing in 
the air. "That happens all the time," says Nawrocki.

FOX TV PLANS 5 NIGHTS OF PROGRAMMING; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE YOUNG NETWORK WANTS TO EXPAND ITS PRIME-TIME SCHEDULE BY FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fledgling Fox TV network is planning to expand to five nights a week of 
programming by this fall, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, seen in Los Angeles on KTTV Channel 11, currently is up to three nights of 
regular, weekly, prime-time programs -- Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The 
so-called "fourth network" debuted in October, 1986, with the late-night, 
ill-fated Joan Rivers show. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is to be at five nights by fall," Peter Chernin, president of Fox 
Entertainment Group, told a gathering of the nation's TV columnists at the 
Registry Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the network, owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, is shooting 
for seven nights a week within two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little ahead of schedule," Chernin said. 
</P>
<P>
The first new full-scale night of Fox shows will be Wednesdays, he added. 
Chernin said that he expected the previously announced Wednesday lineup -- a 
mixture of feature films, TV movies and miniseries -- to go weekly by late 
summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be 60 to 40% in favor of theatricals at the start, shifting 
to 60 to 40, or 70 to 30% in favor of made-for-TV films over a period of time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the fifth night, "most of our thinking has been leaning toward Fridays," 
Chernin said, adding that its programming would be regular series. 
</P>
<P>
If Fox's plans come off as scheduled, that would mean the young network would 
fail to be represented only on Tuesdays and Thursdays by fall. Tuesday is the 
power night of competitor ABC, with its high-rated lineup led by "Roseanne." 
Thursdays are dominated by NBC and its smash-hit schedule propelled by "The 
Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Chernin also disclosed that three new, weekly Fox series -- including one from 
Francis Ford Coppola -- will be launched "in the next two to four months." 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's one-hour series is "The Outsiders," based on the book by S. E. 
Hinton, which was turned into a motion picture by the director. It concerns a 
group of impoverished youths known as "greasers" who are in conflict with 
youngsters from more affluent backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola "was very involved in the making of the pilot and the casting," Chernin 
said. He said the director is also involved in the show's stories and reads the 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
The two other new series are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Molloy," a half-hour sitcom about a bright, 13-year-old girl commited to 
social causes who, after her mother's death, moves in with her estranged father 
and his chic Beverly Hills family. Playing the girl is Mayim Bialik, who 
portrayed Bette Midler's character as a child in the film "Beaches." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Kids Are All Right," a one-hour show focusing on four friends, about 
19 years old, who must cope with life after graduation from high school. 
</P>
<P>
Chernin said that the three new series will be given specific time slots after 
other shows are either canceled or placed on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed delight at the ratings and critical reception of Fox's acerbic new 
animated series, "The Simpsons." The show's impact "exceeds all of our wildest 
expectations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, whose sharp focus on the 18- to 34-year-old audience has been praised for 
its effectiveness by Madison Avenue, already has established such other 
well-known series as "Married . . . With Children," "Cops," "America's Most 
Wanted," "21 Jump Street" and "The Tracey Ullman Show." 
</P>
<P>
Chernin said he was uncertain about whether "It's Garry Shandling's Show" may 
be coming to an end.

POP BEAT: JAPANESE ROCK TURNING AMERICAN; 
</P>
<P>
HEAVY METAL: THE ALL-FEMALE GROUP SHOW-YA TAKES A GODZILLA-SIZE STEP AT THE 
PALACE TOWARD SUCCESS IN THE WEST. 
</P>

Business management style, Godzilla movies and cartoons about big-eyed kids and 
flying robots. That's the top of the list of cultural exports from Japan to the 
United States. Yet rock 'n' roll -- in many ways a combination of the three -- 
has rarely made the eastward Pacific crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Show-Ya, a Japanese all-female hard-rock quintet that is a huge hit at home, 
conjured images of all those things Wednesday at the Palace in Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
Its career is being overseen by a determined Tokyo-based management team that 
made sure the show was not just a concert, but an event, replete with both U.S. 
and Japanese camera crews to document the evening. (In contrast, two shows at 
the Roxy and one at Gazzarri's last year -- the only other times the band has 
played in the States -- were kept low-key and not very well publicized.) 
Musically, Show-Ya crunches like a monster on a rampage, performing rock-hard 
songs with accomplished flair -- maybe a bit too neat and clean in its 
execution, but still quite impressive. And the young women perform with a sense 
of innocent, cute fun that one record industry observer compared, positively, 
to the cartoon rock star Jem. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, it all added up to a Godzilla-size step toward U.S. success as the 
showcase won over an at-first dubious crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear I'm breaking up L.A. Guns to join Show-Ya?" joked Hollywood 
rocker Tracii Guns after the show. But Guns and the hard-rock fans and 
musicians he was standing with at the show were legitimately impressed by 
Show-Ya's mastery of contemporary heavy-metal styles and staging, and by the 
band's exuberant performance. Whatever novelty factor exists in the band's 
cultural and gender make-up was supplanted quickly by the professional quality 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very good," concurred Lisa Johnson, an A&amp;R scout for the RCA 
subsidiary Zomba Records, and one of many industry representatives in an 
audience split about 50/50 between young Japanese Angelenos and Hollywood 
insiders. "They remind me of Jem . . . and also of the Runaways." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the '70s all-female Los Angeles hard-rock Runaways (Joan Jett and Lita 
Ford were both original members) are a prime example of a U.S. group that was a 
much bigger success in Japan than here. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately no one was reminded of the sugar-coated duo Pink Lady, the only 
Japanese female pop act to make any kind of impact in the U.S. pop market, 
though there's little question that the Show-Ya strategy for success is 
calculated to the last detail. There's more than a hint of sexiness in the 
women's stage outfits, but even that, as one observer noted, is done with a 
safe, doll-like quality. And lead singer Keiko Terada readily admitted 
backstage after the show that her trademark rose tattoo over her right breast 
is actually a decal. 
</P>
<P>
But despite that calculation, Show-Ya -- which plays 15,000-capacity and larger 
halls in Japan and has sold millions of albums -- proved itself a band with 
legitimate merits Wednesday. The four instrumentalists are all solid players, 
if not particularly original, and the songs rock hard with memorable melodic 
hooks sung in a powerful yet controlled voice by Terada. The fact that most of 
the lyrics are in Japanese didn't seem to interfere with anyone's enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're looking for real Japanese rock 'n' roll, look somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
When asked after the show to identify the Japanese qualities in her music, 
Terada, 26, demurred: 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the only difference is the language, because we are trying to be like 
an American rock 'n' roll band," she said through translator John Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The three members of Show-Ya's management team, all clad in conservative 
business suits, stressed that point as they sat nervously in the Palace 
restaurant before the concert. Massy Hayata and Osamu Horiba, president and 
executive producer respectively of International Artmotion Inc., a company that 
represents American painters in Japan and is now working with Show-Ya, and Yuji 
Nishi, who has been managing the group since discovering them at an amateur 
show nearly 10 years ago, were vague about just what the difference between 
Japanese and American rock 'n' roll is. 
</P>
<P>
Nishi, a boyish-looking 34, said, "When they play in Japan they're Japanese. In 
America they're American." 
</P>
<P>
But none of them could elaborate on just what that means, referring only to a 
"Japanese feeling" and an "American feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jensen, the Los Angeles based publicist who has worked with Show-Ya 
since seeing the band at the "Music Summit" in Moscow last summer, thinks it's 
inappropriate to look to Show-Ya's music for insight into Japanese culture the 
way one might look to the Gipsy Kings' music to learn about Gypsy culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't compare them to the Gipsy Kings," Jensen said. "But I wouldn't call 
(German hard-rock band) Scorpions representative of German culture either. . . 
. The bottom line is I don't think a metal-head is ready to accept the subtle 
nuances musically of Japanese musical culture." 
</P>
<P>
And acceptance is definitely what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the No. 1 priority," Jensen said. "They want to be accepted, be one of 
the No. 1 rock bands around the world." 
</P>
<P>

Amphitheater on Feb. 16. Tickets on sale now. . . . Bobby McFerrin and his 
10-member Voicestra will be at UCLA's Royce Hall April 10-15. . . . The Roxy

LEWITZKY SERIES OFFERS THERAPY FOR THE INTIMIDATED; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: 'IN THE WORKS' PROGRAM ALLOWS CHOREOGRAPHERS TO PERFORM AND DISCUSS 
THEIR PIECES IN A RELAXED FORMAT. 
</P>

<P>
Scared of ballet? Intimidated by modern dance? Freaked by folk? L.A. dance 
doyenne Bella Lewitzky says she has the perfect therapy for you. 
</P>
<P>
It's "In the Works" -- a new, low-price series sponsored by Lewitzky's Dance 
Gallery that's designed to "demystify dance," Lewitzky says, and "enliven 
audience participation." 
</P>
<P>
Starting Sunday and continuing through June 10, the programs will begin at 5 
p.m. at the Gascon Institute in the old Helms Bakery Building in Culver City. 
The goal is to make 12 L.A.-area choreographers and their works accessible in a 
relaxed, unpretentious format. 
</P>
<P>
Each dance will be preceded by a brief introduction by Lewitzky, followed by a 
more intimate one by its creator. After the performance, audience members will 
be encouraged to chat with artists about how they cook up their pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun, light, informal evening -- with, I hope, a profoundly interesting 
purpose," Lewitzky, 74, says. "The choreographers, all established artists, 
will be able to talk about their works-in-progress on their own terms." 
</P>
<P>
But shouldn't the art be able to speak for itself? 
</P>
<P>
"Not necessarily," Lewitzky answers. "In order to understand dance, it's not 
enough to see dance." 
</P>
<P>
It's a lesson Lewitzky learned the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dance Gallery brought William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet to Los 
Angeles last June, Lewitzky heard that certain audience members were puzzled by 
the rock 'n' roll, street-style, balletic idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with not 'getting' a piece," she says. "Everyone comes 
to a dance with preconceptions -- sometimes those distance you from a work. 
</P>
<P>
"People raised on 'Fame' or 'The Nutcracker' might come to a Lewitzky concert 
and wonder why all these people are simply walking around on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is so multicultural. It'd be wrong to expect that we all have the same 
backgrounds and come to a dance the same way. Often you need to put a work in 
context before it comes alive." 
</P>
<P>
Such musings led Lewitzky, along with the series' five-member panel, to arrange 
a dance menu filled with light fare, expositions -- and juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
The first double bill features two choreographers with wildly different styles: 
Rudy Perez's cool cultural critiques and Francisco Martinez's balletic leaps of 
emotional faith. 
</P>
<P>
Perez is using the opportunity to present a new work: "One + 2 plus 1 = 
Mischief." 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer says he is going to dish up "a live version of MTV, with all 
the fast music and fast cuts" and is collaborating with jazz-pop composer Tommy 
Pelpier. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of rock and salsa into Perez's minimalist aesthetic is new. 
Perez says he is eager to know "who my audience is," and what they make of his 
change. 
</P>
<P>
But Perez is worried that "the Dance Gallery will make the series feel too 
academic." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the '90s," he says. "I'd like to think that if I'm light and honest I'm 
on the right track. The audience is a lot smarter than we think and I trust 
them more than the die-hards to tell me if a work is dated or not." 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Francisco Martinez, who shares the program with Perez, is less 
adventuresome. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I've been performing in Southern California for nine years, this is 
my first L.A. concert," he says of his 1987 "Palaces." "It's scary to have to 
have to deal with the audiences' feelings." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly why Lewitzky says she is excited by the dialogue. The point is 
to dislodge the intimidating boundaries between spectator and spectacle that 
keep potential aficionados glued to their VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found the L.A. audience more open than any other," she says. "They are 
willing to go almost any place with the artist." 
</P>
<P>
But audiences also need dances -- and theaters -- to go to. Is Lewitzky's 
series an attempt to quiet complaints in the dance community that it's taking 
too long for her Dance Gallery to be built? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," she says. "Education has always been one of our primary goals, 
regardless of the status of the Dance Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I'm happy to report that we're closer in our fund-raising goals than 
we've been. However, with the absence of the Dance Gallery building, our 
challenge is all the more pressing: to develop audiences and suggest that they 
don't have to be intimidated by dance. 
</P>
<P>
"This series could open up a whole new relationship between dancers and 
audiences in L.A. Making choreographers accessible to audiences may be one of 
our great challenges in L.A. as well as one of our big achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Other "In the Works" programs will bring together Anthony Shay (Avaz) and Leon 
Mobley (Djimbe) on Feb. 11, Gregg Bielemeier and Stephanie Gilliland on March 
18, Gloria Newman and Sarah Shelton Mann on April 29, Keith Terry, I Wayan 
Dibia and Juan Talavera on May 20, Susan Rose and Ferne Ackerman on June 10. 
The Gascon Institute is at 8735 Washington Blvd., near National Boulevard.

HOT SPOTS FOR WINTER'S FAVORITE SPORT ARE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN 
RESORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE, Cooke is a frequent contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, OK, Mr. Ripley, we believe it! Truth can be stranger than fiction. Yes, 
some of California's hottest skiing is--imagine it! -- right here at home, at 
local mountain ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in January we were hearing that we had some of the best ski conditions 
in the state," said Snow Summit spokeswoman Cathy Boire. "The latest storms 
have natural snow on top of our man-made base, so conditions are even better 
now. These are the best conditions we have seen this season." 
</P>
<P>
The five big Southern California resorts -- Bear Mountain and Snow Summit near 
Big Bear Lake, and Snow Valley 5 miles east of Running Springs in the San 
Bernardino Mountains, and Mountain High and Ski Sunrise near Wrightwood in the 
San Gabriel Mountains -- are reporting a 2- to 4-foot base of packed powder, 
inclusive of the natural snowfall this week. 
</P>
<P>
Five other resorts -- Mt. Waterman, Kratka Ridge and Mt. Baldy, and Snow Forest 
(celebrating its 50th year and boasting a lift that handles 1,800 skiers an 
hour and an 80-degree run) and Ski Green Valley -- are also reporting a base of 
2 feet or more and powder up to 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
After an unusually warm, dry fall, early January storms brought nothing less 
than the winter wonderland that skiers -- and resort operators -- had prayed 
for, the realization of their white dreams. 
</P>
<P>
As a few die-hard skiers had already discovered, runs at most local resorts had 
been covered with snow and skiable since Thanksgiving, thanks to snow-making 
technology. But real nature-made snow, that fluffy stuff that blankets trees, 
rocks, peaks and ski lodges as only Mother Nature can, made a psychological 
difference. The problem, according to Boire, is that with warm weather in the 
city, people didn't think about skiing until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more important," she said, "are skiers' " perceptions of conditions. 
This new snow is great, but it's nothing compared to what we've been making. 
We've had a good base for weeks, and we've logged in 450 hours of snow-making, 
but it's the rain -- and storms -- that motivate people to want to ski." 
</P>
<P>
According to Boire, the number of skier visits picked up at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached capacity many days since Christmas Day," she said, making the 
point that before traveling to the mountains, it's always important to call 
ahead to any ski area to be sure it isn't sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have the best man-made snow in the area. We were voted fourth in 
the country by Ski Magazine readers, rated against much bigger resorts," Boire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And there was joy at Mt. Waterman. 
</P>
<P>
"This (latest) storm has put the frosting on the cake," Mt. Waterman owner Lynn 
Newcomb's taped voice told callers checking the early-morning ski report. 
Newcomb had good reason to be happy, because snow-making equipment won't be 
installed there until next year; for the moment, Newcomb still depends on the 
vagaries of the jet stream. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Summit, with 30 runs on 210 groomed acres and a vertical drop of 1,200 
feet, is probably the area's best known -- and often most crowded -- ski 
resort. But, Boire says, "we limit our ticket sales, to help ensure the wait in 
lift lines to 10 minutes or less." 
</P>
<P>
While most resorts control ticket sales in some way (Snow Valley gauges crowd 
size by the number of cars in the parking lot), at Snow Summit the promise of 
short waits in lift lines isn't just marketing hype. Oversized clocks at the 
bottom of the chairlifts encourage skiers to verify the number of minutes spent 
inching forward in line. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent capacity day with 4,500 skiers competing for the same snow space, 
only one wait timed out longer -- 11 minutes. There were moments, though, when 
it seemed that all the world was in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Julie and Jill Shumaker and Jennie Lee, high school students from Fountain 
Valley, came up, rewarded for their faith in Mother Nature. "We made 
reservations a month ago," said Julie as she waited to pick up her lift 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
And Jim Nickoloff and Frank Moon, senior citizens from Apple Valley, were 
there, abandoning the golf course for a day in the snow. At noon they stopped 
for lunch at the View Haus cafeteria at the top of Chair 10, the place to snap 
photos of the scene below: blue sky framing snow-covered Big Bear Lake and the 
distant mountains. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Christina Kracht, from Denmark, sporting Day-Glo-green 
sunglasses. "I'm going home in three days," she said, "but when I heard the 
weather report, I knew there was time for one last visit." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the lodge, Line DeVouassoux, from France, New Caledonia and Laguna 
Niguel (in that order), sat in the sun with Cagou, her Saint Bernard, and 
waited for her husband and son. "We've rented a house in Green Valley for a 
week," she said, adding that they planned to try all the area resorts. 
</P>
<P>
At Snow Valley, lift lines were just as busy. Snow conditions are so good 
everywhere, in fact, that Southern California slopes are stealing business from 
the bigger resorts up north. 
</P>
<P>
"Our skiing's been better than Mammoth," said Mountain High spokesman Richard 
Conger early in the month. "We've had such a great year that a couple of my 
friends from there have been coming down here." 
</P>
<P>
This year isn't the first time that a dry December has been followed by several 
months of heavy snow, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"A classic case was the first few months of 1979. After a dry December, we had 
26 inches of rain in January and February. That worked out to about 15 feet of 
groomed snow, with a 7- to 8-foot base." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High is the first local resort to install the latest in chairlift 
technology, a detachable quad. Called the "Mountain High Express," it parallels 
existing Chair 7 (a 15-minute ride up) and carries 2,000 skiers each hour to 
the top of the mountain in just six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Mountain High's 12 chairlifts -- three two-quads, three triples and 
six doubles -- are spread over two peaks facing east and west, providing access 
to 19 miles of ski runs on about 205 groomed acres. 
</P>
<P>
Although facilities are somewhat limited or smaller compared to some of the 
high-elevation Sierra ski resorts, such as Mammoth, Squaw Valley or Kirkwood, 
Southern California resorts hold their own in attracting skiers who don't want 
to travel to the northern ski areas as well as families, parents with toddlers, 
beginners who need ski and boot rentals and lessons, and the average skier who 
hopes to stay fit with a single day of skiing now and then. 
</P>
<P>
To meet these needs, the resorts provide rental shops, ski schools for all ages 
and low-priced beginners' packages. The beginner runs -- so-called "bunny 
slopes" -- are in an area separated from experienced skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that many young adults are career couples with younger children, 
Snow Summit offers a complete child-care program for ages 6 months to 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers spend the day in the Little Bear Care Center, where instructors offer 
ski lessons to 3- and 4-year-olds. Children 5 to 8 can enroll in the Little 
Bear Ski School. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular offering for those who'd like to be ski bums but can't afford 
it is night skiing. Snow Valley, Snow Summit and Mountain High light their 
major runs and sell lots of lift tickets, though temperatures drop when the sun 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
Recent snowfalls notwithstanding, the secret of success in Southern California 
has always been snow-making. The recipe is simple: ordinary water and 
compressed air shot into the air by portable guns attached to water hoses. As 
billions of tiny droplets hit the cold air they turn to snow. And when an 
expert has his finger on the trigger, the results are indistinguishable from 
natural snow. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bear Mountain spokeswoman Monica Bandows, the ideal snow-making 
conditions are 20-degree temperatures and 30% humidity. "In 12 hours," she 
says, "we could cover a one-mile stretch of the San Diego Freeway with 5 1/2 
feet of snow." 
</P>
<P>
But snow isn't all that skiers want, and local resorts have obliged with the 
expected amenities: comfortable lodges; large and efficient cafeterias; cozy 
bars with windows that look out over the slopes; ski shops selling the newest 
clothes, goggles, skis and boots; a rental and lesson shop; electronic game 
rooms, and, in some places, a traditional fireplace for warming cold toes. 
</P>
<P>
Skiers heading up to Big Bear Lake can stay overnight to avoid the one- to 
three-hour drive up the mountain. The town has dozens of hotels, motels, 
cottages, lodges and bed-and-breakfast inns. The Big Bear Chamber of Commerce, 
(714) 866-4607, has information about a $79 midweek hotel room and lift-ticket 
package; or make a reservation directly by calling (714) 866-5878. Snow Forest 
is in Big Bear; Ski Green Valley is about 6 miles east of Running Springs on 
Green Valley Lake Road. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High and Ski Sunrise attract mostly day skiers, but for overnighters 
there are accommodations in nearby Wrightwood. Mt. Baldy, Mt. Waterman and 
Kratka Ridge are in the national forest and are for day skiing only. Mt. 
Waterman and Kratka Ridge are on Route 2 halfway between Wrightwood and La 
Canada; Mt. Baldy is 15 miles north of Upland and Interstate 10. 
</P>
<P>
Most resorts sell tickets through ticket agencies and on the premises. However, 
weekends sell out fast and in advance, so don't drive up without reservations. 
At the height of the season, midweek and weekend lift tickets are the same 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, resorts offer special prices for teen-agers, children and senior 
citizens, and learn-to-ski packages for beginners. Seniors 65 and older ski 
free at Kratka Ridge and Ski Sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
Although lift tickets for some resorts can only be purchased at the site, most 
of the resorts offer lift tickets through Ticketron, (213) 642-4242 or 
Ticketmaster (213) 480-3232). Prices vary quite a lot; adult tickets range from 
about $15 to $35; children's tickets from about $12 to $18. 
</P>
<P>

WOODEN IT BE LOVELY, SAY WOODWORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PETER BENNETT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even Leatherface of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" notoriety would envy Judith 
Reifman's skill. 
</P>
<P>
The sinewy woodworker guides the gnashing teeth of her Briggs &amp; Stratton 
chain saw with deadly accuracy, ripping into the stubborn flesh of mahogany 
wood to shape her signature piece, "Erzulie 1," a full-figured Haitian goddess. 
</P>
<P>
Just down the hall from "Erzulie 1," a solid-mahogany front end of a 1986 325i 
BMW juts out of a wall like an auto accident, its yellow blinker flashing 
distress to a crowd of rubberneckers. 
</P>
<P>
Creator Craig Leese, a master's candidate in the fine arts program at Cal State 
Fullerton, explains his car's dismemberment: "I didn't need the whole car to 
illustrate that the traditional quality of wood still has a play in 
contemporary design." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, Ingemar Persson's "UFO," fashioned from flamed maple, hovers 
over a group of interested earthlings. 
</P>
<P>
These are just three of the handcrafted wood exhibits on display at "California 
Woodworking 1990," a juried show at the Brea Civic &amp; Cultural Center 
Gallery that features the works of more than 60 celebrated craftsmen from 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the Orange County Woodworkers Assn., the exhibition is now in its 
second week and will continue through Feb. 16. Gallery hours are noon to 5 p.m. 
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, and noon to 8 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a slightly warped sense of humor, the show has attracted a serious 
combination of hobbyists and professionals, including juror Sam Maloof, 74, a 
John D. MacArthur fellow from Alta Loma, whose work resides in the White House 
and the Vatican museum. 
</P>
<P>
"This show will let people know what Southern California woodworkers can do," 
Maloof said at the show's opening Jan. 12. "The exhibitors don't have to take a 
back seat to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 pieces were submitted for entry in the show before Maloof 
whittled down the competition to 80 works. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to make it a well-rounded exhibit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The expertly crafted works were judged in four categories -- furniture, 
accessories, wood turning and sculpture -- and represent a wide range of 
styles, including folk, traditional, arts and crafts and post-modern. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition offers several looks and changes of pace," said show chairman 
Bill Docking. "We have a Chippendale game table and a Greene &amp; Greene 
recliner, and some highly sculptural pieces with a contemporary Art Deco spin." 
</P>
<P>
Currently carving a niche for himself at the woodworking exhibition is 
architect-turned artist Po Shun Leong, whose work, "Complexities and Traditions 
1989," captured the Best of Show award. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how long it took to construct the series of complex hardwood boxes that 
form the facade of a building, the British-born Chinese artist joked: "All of 
my 48 years." 
</P>
<P>
That may not be an exaggeration. As each box is opened, a mysterious inner 
scene appears like a window on the world's ancient Oriental, Mayan, Greek and 
Roman civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
Children are especially enchanted by the hidden spaces and secret compartments 
of Po's miniature world. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey dad, this is really rad," said Brian Griffin, 5, of Duarte, quickly 
discovering a fascination with the swiveling stack of wooden trays. 
</P>
<P>
Po's "Pompeii Vase" also captured a first prize, in sculpture. Again, the 
artist's fertile imagination plays host to a faraway kingdom where stairs, 
ladders and crescent-shaped bridges lead past pyramids, trapezoids and other 
geometrical wonders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a wooden Shangri-La," said Nancy Anderson, a South Pasadena graphic 
designer. "I felt the artist somehow rounded up a bunch of termites with Ph.Ds 
in woodworking and then cut 'em loose." 
</P>
<P>
Another featured artist who clearly cuts across the grain of convention is 
Frank E. Cummings III, whose work, "My Complements in the Crystal Castle," won 
first place in accessories. 
</P>
<P>
His ornate "spiritual cabinet" is adorned with an ethereal crown of Brazilian 
rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the spires of the crown look parallel, they in fact converge at some 
celestial crossroads, which tells me that all things meet at a certain time and 
place," said Cummings, who is associate dean of the School of Arts at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the show, woodworking demonstrations will be presented every 
Saturday from noon to 2 p.m. Today, Jim Impey will share his knowledge on 
carving, followed by Eljay Overholt on band-saw boxes (Jan. 27), Ed Smet and 
Len Musgrave on rocking chairs (Feb. 3) and Ken Perez on band-saw lettering 
(Feb. 10). 
</P>
<P>
"We try to gear the demonstrations toward people who are not woodworkers," said 
Al Griffin, president of the Orange County Woodworkers Assn. "There should be 
some dynamic presentations." 
</P>
<P>
In the first demonstration, Howard Lewin, a Manhattan Beach woodworker, had the 
audience practically eating wood shavings out of his hand as he turned out a 
walnut bowl and vase on his high-speed lathe. Although his demonstration will 
not be repeated, visitors still can view his turnings, "Tree Nest" and "Space 
Warp," inside the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery coordinator Marie Sofi asks, however, that guests "look with their eyes 
and not their hands" when perusing the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the works also can be purchased, including Po's Best of Show winner, 
"Complexities and Traditions 1989." Prices range from $50 for a miniature to 
$13,000 for an antelope. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't your typical K mart clearance sale," Docking said. 
</P>
<P>
After making a tour of the gallery, Neal McKencie, a retired aerospace worker 
from Brea, tried to put the exhibition in some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"This stuff is simply sensational," he said. "I just don't know how it would 
look in my living room." 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the Brea Civic &amp; Cultural Center Gallery at One Civic Center 
Circle in Brea, take Lambert Road off the 57 Freeway and head west to State 
College. Head south to the Brea Mall entrance and park at Nordstrom next to the 
gallery.

'HOUSE OF DESIGN' WILL OPEN ITS DOORS IN APRIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 Pasadena Showcase House of Design, a 9,000-square-foot mansion on the 
east bank of the Arroyo Seco, is "French in feeling, similar in character to a 
minor chateau," according to an account written in 1916, the year the house was 
designed by the architectural firm of Allison &amp; Allison for Mr. and Mrs. 
Julius C. Daniels of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the European-oriented exterior -- with its green-slate roof and 
creamy concrete walls -- the architectural firm created an interior influenced 
by the American Federal period. 
</P>
<P>
The house sits on a two-acre site -- room enough for eating areas and arts and 
crafts boutiques, which will be in place when the house is opened to the public 
April 22 through May 20. 
</P>
<P>
This represents the 26th year the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee has 
chosen an estate in the Pasadena area and assigned about 30 interior or 
landscape designers to design specific areas of the house and grounds. 
Thirty-eight designers are involved this year. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing is on a reserved-ticket basis only, according to Susan Clayton of the 
sponsoring Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee. Proceeds benefit the 
orchestra and youth music appreciation and education programs in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the second time the reserved-ticket system has been used. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit chairman Shirley Goldsmith and her committee have chosen Baltimore 
Blue, Cranberry Red, Empire Green, Old Virginia Gold and Independence Ivory as 
this year's color pallette for the American Federalist interior. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets ($10 through April 22, $15 after that date and at the door) may be 
obtained through Ticketmaster at May Co. or Music Plus stores; visitors can 
obtain information on the ticket system and parking arrangements by calling 
(818) 792-4661. 
</P>
<P>
The house will be closed Mondays and Tuesdays. It will be open 10 a.m. to 8 
p.m. Wednesdays through Fridays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

LANDSCAPING CAN BE 1ST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST WILDFIRE; 
</P>
<P>
GARDENING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Southern Californians would agree that hills and canyons are among the 
most desirable places to live. But these wild, yet settled, places at the edge 
of the metropolis -- what botanists sometimes call "the urban-chaparral 
interface" -- are the properties most threatened by wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
While little can be done to control the natural fires that occur in chaparral 
country, homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve 
the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind fire-resistant landscaping -- firescaping -- is to design 
landscaping to minimize the fire hazard," says Owen Dell, a Santa Barbara 
landscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients. 
</P>
<P>
Dell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in 
which 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of 
additional Santa Barbara residences. After the fire, Dell began studying its 
effects. "Many of my clients lost property, but the fire jumped from house to 
house, then skipped others. I realized that the landscaping had a relationship 
to the amount of devastation." 
</P>
<P>
Dell, the Santa Barbara City Fire Department, the city government and a number 
of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the Santa Barbara 
Firescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing the risks 
of wildfire near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The concept behind the garden is that while no plant is fireproof, some are 
more flammable than others. The garden is a model of how to design and maintain 
landscaping around the home to provide a line of defense against fire. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable 
vegetation planted farthest from the house. Zone 4, farthest from the house, 
consists of native vegetation that has been thinned to reduce the amount of 
fuel that could feed a fire. Native chaparral flora, including oaks, ceanothus 
and manzanita, are found here. 
</P>
<P>
Zone 3 includes plants selected for their low profile and slow-burning 
characteristics. Wildflowers such as Pacific Coast iris, monkeyflower and 
California poppies add a splash of color to this zone. 
</P>
<P>
Zone 2 features highly fire-retardant succulents. It's designed to be a 
greenbelt zone of maximum fire protection. Jade, aloe vera, phormium and 
evergreen currant are among the high-moisture-content plants characteristic of 
this zone. 
</P>
<P>
Zone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little 
risk of burning. Cactus, tobira and shiny leaf jasmine are examples of 
fire-resistant plants that still have a high aesthetic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Some trees and plants are surprisingly hazardous. "Those eucalyptus trees," 
Dell says. "If one of those lights up near your house, there's no way to save 
it. And the Monterey pine -- it's so full of volatile oils, it's almost 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
One popular plant found almost everywhere in Southern California -- ice plant 
-- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden. Actually, it can be 
a menace. The plant produces a great deal of litter beneath that succulent 
surface and can smolder for days. Two other surprisingly flammable flora are 
redwood trees and bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
Dell thinks several successive drought years have finally persuaded Southern 
Californians to rethink approaches to gardening. Suddenly, xeriscaping -- 
landscaping with drought-tolerant natives -- is becoming commonplace and 
fashionable. As Dell sees it, while many home gardeners have learned to deal 
with low-water conditions, they've virtually ignored another common Southern 
California occurrence -- wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
Just as appropriate landscaping can help gardeners with water shortages, so may 
careful landscaping help reduce the risk of significant property damage in the 
most fire-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Firescapes Demonstration Garden is located across the street from City Fire 
Station 7 at 2411 Stanwood Drive and is open every day from 8 a.m. until 
sunset. A brochure available at the garden aids your exploration. For 
additional information, contact the Santa Barbara City Fire Department public 
education coordinator at (805) 564-5703. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the garden: From U.S. 101 in Santa Barbara, exit on Salinas Street and 
continue to a five-way intersection. Bear right (north) on Sycamore Canyon Road 
(144) to Stanwood Drive (192). Turn left and continue to the fire station, on 
your left, just opposite the garden. There's ample parking at the station, 
which is located on the corner of Stanwood Drive and Mission Ridge Road.

REPORTER'S EARLY EXCLUSIVES TRIGGERED A MEDIA FRENZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was an aggressive, award-winning investigative reporter -- and, at times, an 
ombudsman paid to criticize his own television station, publicly, on his own 
television station. But Wayne Satz will always be best known in local 
journalistic and law enforcement circles for breaking the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation story. 
</P>
<P>
Satz had been working on a general story about child sexual abuse for a couple 
of months in late 1983 when he first heard about McMartin. He vigorously 
pursued the story, then delayed his first broadcast three weeks, he says, when 
then-Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian told him that premature disclosure of the 
investigation could jeopardize the case. 
</P>
<P>
Satz's first McMartin broadcast aired on KABC Channel 7 on Feb. 2, 1984 -- the 
beginning of "sweeps" month, when local television stations traditionally 
broadcast their most attention-getting programming in hopes of attracting the 
high ratings on which local advertising rates are based. 
</P>
<P>
Satz denies that the sweeps were a factor in the timing of his early stories, 
and he is equally insistent that other, even harsher criticisms of his McMartin 
coverage are also unjustified. But Satz was unquestionably the most important 
and most controversial media figure in the early stages of the case and now, 
six years later, with the verdicts finally in, his role is worth examining in 
some detail. 
</P>
<P>
Satz, who left KABC in mid-1987, is not just the reporter who broke the story; 
he is also the only reporter to be sued by former McMartin defendants and he is 
the reporter who, while covering the story, became romantically linked to the 
social worker at Children's Institute International whose interviews with 
McMartin children became the controversial early crux of the prosecution's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
More important, it was Satz's early coverage that triggered a feeding frenzy in 
the media, both locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles television reporters in particular were immediately under pressure 
from their superiors to match -- or surpass -- the exclusive McMartin stories 
Satz was broadcasting night after night. 
</P>
<P>
"There was hysteria in the newsroom," says Ross Becker of KCBS. "I remember the 
news director . . . sitting there watching . . . Satz and coming to me and 
saying, 'Ross, we got killed again.' 
</P>
<P>
"The story took on a life of its own," Becker says. "We didn't even think at 
the time . . . about what we were doing. . . . It was 'We gotta get something 
new on McMartin; look how big this thing is getting. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other local reporters interviewed for this story, Satz makes no 
apologies for his coverage. Most of the others say they are embarrassed by, 
even ashamed of, their lack of early skepticism and their initial eagerness to 
believe even the most unlikely prosecution allegations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Not Satz. His coverage, he says, was "fair-minded," not "unquestioning or 
uncritical at any point." 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost nothing (in my coverage) I would change," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But a review of that coverage over two years' time (reports dotted with words 
like "grotesque," "nightmarish," "chilling," "horrific," "bizarre," "amazing," 
"depravity," and "mind-blowing") and interviews with others involved in the 
case (participants and other journalists alike) leaves little doubt that Satz's 
early stories were largely instrumental in establishing the hysterical tone in 
both the media and the general public that is now loudly decried on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Even prosecutors and some parents and children in the case agree that Satz's 
coverage was both sensationalized and, at least implicitly, pro-prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"Channel 7 coverage was outrageous. . . . Wayne was so pro-prosecution," says 
Christine Johnston, a prosecutor who withdrew from the case when she developed 
doubts about the guilt of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston says she was especially offended when Satz telephoned her at home on 
the day The Times published a story quoting another, unnamed prosecutor as 
expressing similar doubts. She says Satz wrongly accused her of having been the 
prosecutor in question; as subsequent events made clear, it was actually Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Glenn Stevens. The implication of Satz's alleged call, she says, 
was that she had damaged the prosecution's case and he was angry about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nasty Tone of Voice' 
</P>
<P>
"The tone of voice he used . . . was a really nasty tone of voice," Johnston 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Satz will neither confirm nor deny having called Johnston at home, but he 
insists that he never said anything to her that could be construed as his being 
angry that she had damaged the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
Some McMartin parents say Satz did make clear to them, though, that he 
genuinely believed their children and supported their cause. 
</P>
<P>
One parent, Diane Carter, described Satz's coverage as "very inflammatory" at a 
time when parents, having been accused by the defense of being hysterical, were 
trying to "project an aura of being credible, reasonable." Other parents even 
began giving information to another television reporter because they thought 
Satz's overheated approach might ultimately undermine their cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Awards 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, Satz must be credited with some very good work on McMartin; just 
as he won a Peabody Award, broadcasting's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, for 
his 1977 stories on police shootings of civilians, so his McMartin work earned 
him two Golden Mikes, awards similar to Emmys for local TV news. Although he 
broke the first story on charges that the McMartin children had been forced to 
indulge in satanic rituals, for example, he ultimately paid far less attention 
to the Satanism charges than did many others in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Satz was more responsible and evenhanded than most in his handling of 
several aspects of the case -- consistently interviewing defense attorneys and 
spokesmen; asking tough questions of the prosecutors and of the most outspoken 
McMartin parent; saying that some allegations "could have been planted" in the 
children's minds by "well-intentioned questions" from parents; acknowledging on 
the air that, if a child witness fantasized about some charges, it was 
legitimate to ask if he might have fantasized about others. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, Satz was ahead of all the other media, day after day, on each new 
development in the case. He also broadcast the first interview with Virginia 
McMartin, the founder of the school, and the first interviews with McMartin 
parents. He and his camera crew even managed to be on the scene to shoot 
exclusive footage of the arrest of prime suspect Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation among those who competed with Satz on the 
story that he and Dist. Atty. Philibosian had cut a secret deal -- that in 
exchange for delaying his first story, Satz persuaded Philibosian to give him 
primary or exclusive access to later developments in the case. Philibosian and 
his top aides at the time deny that. 
</P>
<P>
Satz says he can't even discuss the accusation without violating both the 
confidentiality of his relationships with news sources and the integrity of the 
news-gathering process. He also says any such discussion might be deemed in 
court to constitute a waiver of the privilege that California law grants 
reporters to "shield" their sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competitors' Views 
</P>
<P>
Criticisms of Satz, on this and other aspects of his coverage, may well be just 
the resentful grumblings of beaten competitors. But rival reporters -- 
including Becker of KCBS -- say they had never before chased a story on which 
another reporter had every important source locked up so tightly. In fact, 
Becker says, he still has "a sinking, ugly feeling in my stomach" that the D.A. 
might never have filed charges in the McMartin case had it not been for Channel 
7's stories and the public attention they generated. 
</P>
<P>
Several McMartin parents, all of whom were angrily determined to have those 
charges brought, agree with Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Philibosian denies that, too, but prosecutor Stevens, who left the district 
attorney's office under fire after telling reporters of his doubts about the 
guilt of the defendants,says Philibosian was clearly pressured to act by Satz's 
persistent, challenging questions. 
</P>
<P>
Philibosian was facing a difficult reelection campaign against the better-known 
Ira Reiner, then the Los Angeles city attorney, and a public opinion poll 
conducted for Philibosian identified child abuse as a potential "cutting edge" 
issue in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Philibosian denies that there was any pressure from Satz, Satz did 
break the story; and the story did say the district attorney had subpoenaed 
witnesses to appear before the grand jury; and Philibosian did play an 
unusually visible, public role in the early stages of the case. Satz continued 
to beat every reporter in town on the story for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Satz was just a better reporter. Certainly, he had better sources, a big 
head start and a team of reporters out in the field, questioning everyone they 
could find. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer himself, Satz also had "far and away . . . a better grasp of McMartin 
than any other journalist," Stevens says. 
</P>
<P>
Others also say Satz's understanding of the legal system made his coverage of 
what happened in the courtroom better than any other reporter's, but these same 
people almost invariably found his coverage of the early stages of the case in 
particular both sensationalized and pro-prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Satz's behavior may have been no different from that of any other 
hard-driving reporter who gets a big jump on the competition on what seems to 
be a remarkable story. Nor can he ultimately be held responsible for what other 
reporters did in their effort to keep pace with him. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, others at his station contributed to the general perception that KABC 
was on a crusade. A news anchor several times made inflammatory comments on the 
air while chatting with Satz, and KABC management ran two full-page newspaper 
advertisements trumpeting its coverage, featuring photos of a battered teddy 
bear and leaving little doubt that the station seemed to believe the charges 
against the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
But Satz, who is critical of the KABC ads and of the anchor's comments, said 
more than enough on the air himself to prompt the criticism directed at him. 
</P>
<P>
In his very first story, he reported that more than 60 children -- maybe many 
more -- "some of them as young as 2 years of age," had been telling authorities 
a "grotesque secret"; they said that they had been molested by their preschool 
teachers, that they had been "made to appear in pornographic films" and that 
they had been "forced to witness the mutilation and killing of animals" to 
scare them into staying silent. 
</P>
<P>
Satz's subsequent stories told of children's tales about druggings, airplane 
rides, the brandishing of guns, satanic rituals, the "mutilation of corpses," 
the drinking of blood and the sacrifice of a live baby in a church. 
</P>
<P>
Satz says he was merely reporting what his sources were telling him, and he 
insists -- correctly -- that his stories included "more defendant/suspect 
denials . . . than any other media working the story." He repeatedly said in 
his stories that the defendants "vigorously" or "categorically" or 
"steadfastly" denied all charges. Once he even told viewers the defendants 
sounded "extremely convincing" in their denials, and on several occasions he 
said, "They may be entirely innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other local television reporters, Satz did not broadcast interviews 
with McMartin children, an act he considered "exceedingly exploitative." 
Although other stations showed the children with their faces in shadow and 
their voices disguised, Satz thinks they were still recognizable to people who 
already knew them. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Leighton, an independent reporter, worked with Satz on the McMartin story, 
as he has worked over the years on investigative stories for "60 Minutes," 
"20/20" and public television; he says Satz "agonized over every single little 
piece of information (he broadcast). He was overly conscious of getting every 
little piece of information right and trying to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
All this notwithstanding, the overwhelming implication of Satz's early, daily 
drumbeat of charges and disclosures, his inflection and tone of voice on 
certain words ("lit-tle children"), his frequent promises that the case would 
get bigger and bigger and his juxtaposition of various elements in his stories 
was that monstrous crimes had indeed taken place at McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Satz's broadcast message was more than implicit: 
</P>
<P>
He showed defendant Babette Spitler -- against whom all charges were later 
dropped -- saying she loved children and "always enjoyed being around 
children"; then Satz himself chimed in to say, "Yes, and if you believe the 
grand jury, she didn't mind assaulting children sexually either." 
</P>
<P>
He accused Virginia McMartin, founder of the McMartin school, of speaking 
"disingenuously" on one occasion and asked her, on another, "So, you think 
you're just being framed, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
He said society should "move ever so slightly toward being ready to believe 
that kids do not talk explicitly about sexual matters unless they really 
occurred, which is what experts say" -- a statement that Satz himself now 
concedes came "dangerously close to commentary." 
</P>
<P>
He identified by name several suspects who were never charged and showed 
videotape of a man he said had "reportedly been described by children as 
molesting them and taking pornographic pictures of them." The man was never 
formally accused of anything, but Satz says it was appropriate to identify the 
man on the air because "a significant number of children" had alleged that he 
had taken pornographic photos of them, because he was "named in court" as a 
suspect in the case and because other media, including The Times, also 
identified him. 
</P>
<P>
And what of information Satz didn't broadcast? 
</P>
<P>
When the prosecution charged in March, 1984, that the McMartin Pre-School was, 
in effect, a front for a massive child pornography ring, the story was 
blockbuster news in most media. 
</P>
<P>
Did Satz and his team of reporters investigate that charge? 
</P>
<P>
He says they did, thoroughly, and -- like the district attorney, the FBI, the 
U.S. Customs Service and various local law enforcement agencies and task forces 
-- they did not find a single one of the "millions" of photographs and films 
that Deputy Dist. Atty. Eleanor Barrett had said were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Did Satz report that on KABC? 
</P>
<P>
"No. No. No," he says. "It's really a silly question." 
</P>
<P>
The news media doesn't have the same powers as law enforcement authorities, 
Satz says, so KABC's failure to find any pornography didn't really mean 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
But if he had found some McMartin pornography, he would have broadcast that 
story, wouldn't he? 
</P>
<P>
"You bet. You bet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Romantic Link 
</P>
<P>
Such comments, on and off the air, help explain why many other journalists say, 
in the words of Barbara Palermo, who covered portions of the case for the Daily 
News in the San Fernando Valley: "I don't think there's any doubt that Wayne 
Satz was an advocate for the prosecution. I don't care how many attributions he 
hid behind or how many disclaimers he issued." 
</P>
<P>
Satz's romantic link with Kee MacFarlane, the social worker at Children's 
Institute International who conducted many of the original interviews with 
McMartin children, contributed significantly to this perception. 
</P>
<P>
Satz now refuses even to acknowledge that there was a romance, invoking his 
concerns about source confidentiality, about the integrity of the 
news-gathering process and about the risk of appearing to have waived his 
reporter's privilege under the California shield law. 
</P>
<P>
He does say, however, that he "never had any conflict of interest" on the 
McMartin story, no relationship that unfairly influenced his coverage in any 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Van Amburg, general manager of KABC at the time, declined to be interviewed 
for this story, but he told the Daily News in the San Fernando Valley in 1985 
that Satz had informed station management of his relationship with MacFarlane 
and that management had concluded there had been no breach of journalistic 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
But Satz's single most skeptical piece of reporting on the case -- a lengthy, 
tough-minded analysis that left no one, not even MacFarlane, unscathed -- was 
not broadcast until January, 1986, after his relationship with MacFarlane had 
apparently ended. Moreover, MacFarlane -- clearly a key source for Satz on the 
McMartin story -- testified in court that she and Satz had a 
"boyfriend-girlfriend" relationship beginning about two months after his first 
story was broadcast. Yet he continued to cover the story for almost two years 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders ultimately ruled that there was no 
evidence the romance began before Satz's first story and that testimony on the 
romance would not, therefore, be presented to the jury. But many journalists 
would ask for a different assignment if they became involved with so important 
a figure on a story they were covering, if only to avoid the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you continue the relationship, you get off the story," says Furnell 
Chatman, who has covered the McMartin case for KNBC. "You just can't have both. 
They don't mix. . . . That's a big question of reportorial ethics." 
</P>
<P>
KNBC's Jess Marlow, who was anchor at KCBS during the early stages of McMartin, 
says he has long admired "much of what Wayne Satz has done" and he realizes how 
wrenching it would be for a reporter to remove himself from a big story, 
especially if he had special access to a key figure. But Marlow thinks Satz 
should have done so anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Conner of the Times editorial library assisted with the research for this 
story.

McMARTIN TRIAL: HOW COSTLY? 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the McMartin molestation trail to county taxpayers dwarfed those of 
all other high-publicity criminal trials in Los Angeles County history: 
$13,091,585 
</P>
<P>
Besides McMartin, only two prosecutions cost more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Night Stalker case, which cost $1.8 million at last estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillside Strangler case, which cost $1,643,469.

<P>
The Sirhan Sirhan case: $592,806 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE THE DOLLARS WENT 
</P>
<P>
Here is the breakdown of the costs of the McMartin molestation trial. Figures 
are the latest available. From July, 1983, through October, 1989, the McMartin 
case cost the county $13,091,585. Estimates of the cost of the trial have run 
as high as $15,000,000. Additional costs will be tabulated in coming months for 
the remainder of the case.

FOR EXILED NUNS, IT'S TOO LATE; 
</P>
<P>
BANISHED BY THE COMMUNIST REGIME, CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S SISTERS OF BILA VODA WERE

BILA VODA, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This country's "velvet revolution" came too late for the ideologically 
battle-scarred nuns of Bila Voda. 
</P>
<P>
Banished to this isolated corner of Czechoslovakia in the early 1950s by an 
atheistic regime, the 400 nuns who constitute more than two-thirds of the 
village's population are said to represent the largest concentrated collection 
of disparate religious orders outside the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
For years they longed to return to teaching and the other activities for which 
they were trained before the Communists took over after World War II. But now 
that a new government dominated by the Civic Forum democratic movement has 
committed itself to religious liberty, most of the nuns are too old to go back. 
</P>
<P>
While happy with the "bit of freedom" that has finally come, said Sister Marka 
Raskova, superior of nine nuns from the order of the Blessed Virgin, "we've 
struck roots here by now." 
</P>
<P>
The situation for all 12 orders of nuns in Bila Voda is the same, said Raskova. 
"We are feeling how our strength is ebbing. We are just about able to do what 
we have to around the house and a little work in the garden, and that's about 
all. We had three funerals before Christmas, three more between Christmas and 
the New Year, and three since then." 
</P>
<P>
There were 13 orders of nuns in the village until one of those December 
funerals, which was for the last survivor of the Carmelite community, who died 
at the age of 98. She joined more than 600 other nuns buried in the village 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
While Bila Voda has slowly changed from a place of religious exile to a place 
of religious retirement, the spark of spiritual battle reappears when Raskova, 
72, and her contemporaries joyfully regale unexpected visitors with tales of 
their stormy history. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia was essentially a Roman Catholic country when the Communists 
took over in 1948. And in their drive to wean the population from organized 
religion, "the Communist society didn't want to have nuns in the center of the 
country," said Sister Maria Illuminata Vavrova, provincial vicar of the Notre 
Dame sisters here. 
</P>
<P>
Large convents were abolished, their inhabitants sometimes evicted with only a 
few hours' notice and the premises given over to other uses ranging from old 
people's homes to a police museum. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities sent the youngest nuns to work in factories, said Vavrova, who 
was assigned to a flax processing plant. "The idea was: 'We'll put these young 
sisters with other young people. They'll see how the other young girls live, go 
dancing with them and so on,' " she said. "But instead, the other young ones 
started going with us to the churches. There was a terrible commotion about 
it!" 
</P>
<P>
Raskova was assigned along with 109 other nuns to the Benar textile factory in 
Nad Ploucnice. On their first day of work, she recalled, the nuns were herded 
into an open truck for the half-hour trip from the home of the former factory 
owner, where they were housed, to the plant. They sang religious songs at the 
top of their lungs all the way, and soon they got the closed buses they had 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"The fights we had there not to work on Sundays!" Raskova recalled with obvious 
relish. In the end, she said, it was God, or fate, or some outside force that 
decided the matter. An entire Sunday's production was lost in a fire, probably 
caused by an electrical short-circuit. But the factory manager, convinced that 
it was an omen, ended Sabbath shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Nuns who were not sent to factories were mostly shipped to small villages along 
the northern border that had been stripped of their original German populations 
-- villages such as Bila Voda. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several such centers that they set up," said Vavrova. "In all 
cases, they were isolated villages. They totally abolished male (religious) 
orders; the female orders were recognized, but congregated in these isolated 
places." 
</P>
<P>
Bila Voda, tucked into a hilly, wooded finger of Czechoslovakia surrounded on 
three sides by Poland, certainly qualifies. "I always say that Bila Voda is the 
end of the world," commented the spiritual adviser to the nuns for the last 22 
years, who asked to be identified only as Father Kajetan. 
</P>
<P>
The village is in a part of Silesia that was in the old Austro-Hungarian 
Empire. Its huge church dates from the 18th Century, and the first nuns to come 
to Bila Voda, the Notre Dame Sisters, were fleeing Prussian repression in 1876. 
A large monastery located here at the time offered protection. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until after the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia following 
World War II that other orders were sent to the village and it took on its 
uniquely ecumenical character. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only village in the whole world where there are so many orders," 
boasted Vavrova. "It's a small Vatican. Only here we are really together -- we 
have a joint kitchen, common administration, a common health service. We are 
really united together." 
</P>
<P>
The various communities live in large houses clustered around the village 
center. Elderly nuns in a multicolored variety of different habits identifying 
their particular orders stroll with the help of canes past an outdoor bulletin 
board that still carries Christmas greetings from the local Communist 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence of any Civic Forum presence in town, although, as Raskova 
points out, a photograph of "Mr. President" Vaclav Havel smiles out at 
passers-by from one shop window. A visitor can distinguish the convents from 
Bila Voda's private homes by the sound of singing female voices often emanating 
from the convents. Many of their buildings have been tastefully remodeled, with 
fresh paint on the outside and well-crafted pine paneling inside. But it was 
not always like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice house next to us was a stable when we came," said Raskova. There is 
still a collective farm nearby, and at the time, she said, "all the machinery 
was there. It was a mess!" 
</P>
<P>
Like their peers elsewhere in the country, the nuns of Bila Voda have managed 
to clandestinely admit a few girls into their orders over the years. And about 
18 months ago the government finally permitted some open recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Jan Lebeda, the Catholic general vicar in Prague, said in an interview 
that a recent check turned up more than 3,000 nuns in the country, several 
times more than had previously been acknowledged. "And the mothers superior may 
still have some tucked away that they haven't told us about," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Lebeda said hundreds more are needed simply to care for their elderly 
peers, like those in Bila Voda. 
</P>
<P>
While their lives may not have turned out as they had once wished, the elderly 
nuns here say things are improving under the new government. "Previously, if a 
foreigner like you came, it would have to be written down immediately and 
reported to Prague," confessed Vavrova. 
</P>
<P>
Even earlier, she added, Communist tactics were only partially successful. "We 
completely lost contact with the children," she said. "And that's what they 
really wanted -- to cut us off from the children." On the other hand, Vavrova 
noted, "we have managed to maintain our vocations." 
</P>
<P>
And Raskova remains irrepressible. "I have one principle," she said. "One must 
not grow old mentally. One has to be an optimist and think, 'What good can I 
do?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I am not sorry for any of these interventions by the state," Raskova added 
with an animated smile. "It's been a very interesting life."

"I'm talking gigantic turtle. I mean large turtle," the President of the United 
States said as he peered through a borrowed pair of binoculars at a 
platter-sized terrapin basking in the south Florida sun. 
</P>
<P>
With six sixth-graders from a local program for gifted children, President 
Bush, accompanied by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., toured part of 
the Everglades National Park Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The day led to no new policy initiatives -- a government program to protect 
endangered wetlands remains stalled by objections from the oil industry, 
development advocates and Administration conservatives. But the tour did allow 
Bush to demonstrate one of his greatest skills -- few politicians are more 
comfortable working in front of television cameras with photogenic children. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, there's a big alligator. That's a big boomer," Bush, dressed in an 
open-collar shirt and tan pants exclaimed. "What do you know about alligators?" 
he asked the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"The male alligators eat the females' babies," one child responded. Bush 
winced. 
</P>
<P>
As ospreys, vultures and long-necked anhingas passed overhead, Bush and the 
youngsters chatted and took lessons on south Florida ecology from park ranger 
David Kronk, who said the park is endangered because of many conflicting 
demands for the region's water. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you all can go away realizing you have to protect this resource," Bush 
said. "You can't stop everything," he added, referring to the needs of the 
region's growing cities and industry. "You need good management." 
</P>
<P>
The group was precocious, talkative and carefully balanced to mirror the area's 
ethnic diversity -- one black, three Latinos, an Asian, an Anglo. Bush 
demonstrated his rudimentary Spanish with two of the children -- Que buena, he 
said as he pointed out one bird. He asked them what they had learned about 
protecting the fragile wetlands environment and answered typical school kid 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is your car bulletproof?" asked one. "Yes," Bush replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you open the windows?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't like that," Bush said, pointing to one of his Secret Service 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bush traveled to Atlanta, where, at the site of last year's 
Democratic convention, he offered unusual praise for a man he had blasted 
during three national campaigns -- former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
In two campaigns for vice president and one for President, Bush had ridiculed 
Carter, referring to him as the "master of malaise" and used him as a living 
symbol of bad old days. Friday, however, his tenor had changed. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his thousand points of light volunteerism program, Bush said: "I 
couldn't come to Atlanta without taking note of one such point of light, a 
part-time carpenter and his wife who have provided shelter for so many in this 
very city. And, of course, I'm talking about the former President Jimmy, and 
Rosalyn Carter." 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving Washington, Carter has worked with Habitat for Humanity, a group 
that builds housing for the poor. His efforts have drawn widespread praise, and 
the compliment by Bush was another in a series of signs that after years of 
being a target of GOP attacks, Carter is making something of a comeback in 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's purpose in visiting Atlanta was a speech to the National Assn. of 
Homebuilders. It was a highly sympathetic audience for his repetition of a 
now-standard appeal for Congress to pass the Administration's capital gains tax 
cut program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated an Administration call for lower interest rates, the second day 
in a row that the White House has applied pressure on the Federal Reserve Board 
to ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last few years, millions of families could afford a new home because 
mortgage interest rates have dropped, from 18% in the early '80s to less than 
10% today. But I want to see them come down even more. I am not satisfied at 
10%." 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the Everglades tour, Bush spoke here at a fund-raising event for 
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican who faces a difficult reelection 
campaign despite the overwhelming margin by which Bush carried Florida last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has been in trouble recently in part because of his strong backing of 
restrictions on abortion.

ISRAEL JAILS A TOP PALESTINIAN, PROBES REVOLT ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
ARAB UPRISING: THE ARREST OF A PROSPECTIVE NEGOTIATOR IS A SETBACK TO HOPES FOR 
PROPOSED PEACE TALKS.

<P>
An Israeli court Friday ordered Faisal Husseini, a top Palestinian leader, to 
spend four days in jail while police investigate his alleged role in the Arab 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, who had been expected to play a part in proposed peace talks, said 
his arrest was a pretext for the Israeli government to derail the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to obstruct the peace process and also to confuse the 
Israeli public so it will be suspicious of our peaceful intent," Husseini told 
a reporter while waiting to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he left the courtroom, he shouted defiantly, "Nothing can stop the 
peace process!" 
</P>
<P>
The police suspect Husseini of giving $450 to young Palestinian activists so 
they could buy uniforms. He also is accused of condoning attacks on Israelis 
and the execution of suspected Arab collaborators by Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Court sources said the information regarding the uniforms was provided by 
Palestinian sources and the information on his other activities by secret 
intelligence reports. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, hawkish politicians and ultranationalist Israeli groups have 
demanded that Husseini be imprisoned. His arrest comes at a time when the 
government is under fire for putting soldiers on trial for allegedly beating, 
shooting and otherwise abusing Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
As policemen stood by, Husseini was spat on and pummeled by two unidentified 
Israelis as he left the court. One of the assailants screamed, "Stinking Arab, 
we shall destroy you!" 
</P>
<P>
According to court reports, the police want to question Husseini "on suspicion 
he assisted an illegal organization that acted within the framework of the 
uprising." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could be imprisoned for up to seven years. He already has 
spent more than 18 months in jail without being charged and was released a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, 49, is associated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. He is the scion of an old Jerusalem family and son of 
an Arab leader who was killed fighting Israelis in the 1948 war of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini's recent efforts in support of civil disobedience had put Israeli 
officials on guard. Last fall, the police blocked him from holding a news 
conference in support of a tax revolt in the West Bank town of Beit Sahur. In 
December, he led a peaceful rally of Palestinians, Israelis and others at 
Jerusalem's Old City. Policemen attacked the demonstrators with clubs, tear gas 
and jets of water. Later, the police tear-gassed the interior of a hotel where 
Husseini was preparing to talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, while expressing sympathy with the motives behind fatal attacks by 
Palestinians on suspected informers, also has criticized such executions. He 
had declared 1990 as a year to convince the Israeli public that Palestinians 
could be trusted to run their own affairs in a free state next to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel recently barred Husseini from traveling to the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, then from traveling abroad. The foreign travel ban drew a protest 
from the United States, but Israel refused to rescind it. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini's name has appeared on virtually every list of participants in 
possible peace talks. Washington is trying to convene a joint meeting of U.S., 
Israeli and Egyptian representatives to work out the composition of a 
Palestinian delegation. But the plan has bogged down over opposing demands by 
Israel and the PLO. The PLO wants to take part openly; Israel is demanding a 
veto in the matter of who can participate. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has long expressed reservations 
about the talks. By putting Husseini in jail, the government appears to be 
making it clear that anyone with nationalist aspirations is likely to be barred 
from the negotiations. In addition, residents of Arab East Jerusalem, where 
Husseini lives, would not be welcome. Palestinians in Jerusalem have demanded 
that they be represented in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The political implications of Husseini's arrest were grasped immediately by 
onlookers at his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Tsachbi Hanegbi, a member of Parliament from Shamir's rightist Likud Party who 
campaigned for Husseini's arrest, called the Palestinian an extremist. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a profession of talking moderately, but he shares the ideas of the 
PLO," Hanegbi said. "If we take him out of the process, others will arise who 
will be more moderate." 
</P>
<P>
But Ran Cohen of the dovish Citizens Rights Movement called the arrest "a 
foolish step" and added, "If someone imagines that the political process can be 
replaced by a criminal trial, everyone will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Sari Nusseibeh, another prominent Palestinian leader, said Husseini's detention 
is a blow to the "evolution of the Palestinian community toward talking to the 
Israelis." Nusseibeh has been named in court documents as a source of PLO 
funding for activists in the uprising, but he has not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Egypt reacted negatively to Husseini's arrest, 
according to wire service reports. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States was 
"surprised and disturbed" by the action. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Israel for the second time this week and the fourth time in the 
past month, Tutwiler said U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown "has told 
them that this action sends precisely the wrong signal to the Palestinians at a 
time of intense efforts to establish a dialogue between them and the Israelis 
and move the process forward." 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Maguid, speaking to reporters in 
Washington after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said the 
arrest was "something we extremely regret; we don't like it."

Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit Czechoslovakia next month to 
signal growing U.S. support for the new government's shift from communism to 
democracy, officials disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who is going to Moscow on Feb. 4 for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, also is considering stops in Romania and Bulgaria, the 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is in the midst of working out a program to lower U.S. 
tariffs so Czechoslovakia can boost its trade with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will meet with Shevardnadze Feb. 6-7 to discuss, among other topics, arms 
control and the civil war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Baker likely will go to Prague on Feb. 8 or 9, depending on other undecided 
travel plans, said the officials, who demanded anonymity. He will wind up in 
Ottawa for the Feb. 12-13 conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers on the U.S. "open skies" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal would allow unarmed aircraft to fly over other countries' 
territories in search of suspected military activity.

<P>
REFORM: NATIONAL PEASANTS PARTY SUPPORTS PLANS TO ABANDON REFERENDUM ON ENDING 
DEATH PENALTY, OUTLAWING COMMUNIST PARTY. 
</P>

<P>
The National Peasants Party said Friday that it supports the decision of the 
National Salvation Front, Romania's provisional government, to abandon plans 
for a referendum on the death penalty and on outlawing the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Peasants Party has emerged as the leading political group in the country 
since the revolution that ousted the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu last month. Its 
support could help rally public opinion behind the front, which has 
flip-flopped on the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the front's leader, under pressure from a crowd of rowdy 
demonstrators, decreed an end to the Communist Party and said the death penalty 
would be reinstated for top officials of the Ceausescu government and the 
secret police. A day later, the front said the issues would be put to a 
nationwide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday the front rescinded both decisions. Capital punishment, 
abolished after Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed Dec. 25, will 
remain abolished. The Communist Party will be allowed to exist, but most 
observers agree it has virtually no public support. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fully informed of the decision before it was announced," Iftene Pop, 
vice president of the Peasants Party, said, "and we agree with it fully. We 
have already expressed our opposition to the death penalty, and we do not want 
to see the Communists banned. We want to see them defeated in a free and fair 
election." 
</P>
<P>
The Peasants Party, Pop said, has received membership applications from 100,000 
Romanians, many of them from a generation that can remember when the Communists 
overturned the 1946 election -- the last free election here -- after the 
Peasants won 76% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pop said his party supports the decisions of the front, a commission 
of 140 members that came together in the first days after the Ceausescu 
overthrow, he added that the Peasants and other parties will continue to press 
for a delay in the date for national elections, now set for April. 
</P>
<P>
"The Peasants, the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party have 
submitted a letter to the front calling for elections to be held in September," 
Pop said. "We hope the front will follow this suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
Ten other groups have announced their intent to file as legal political 
parties, and most of them, Pop believes, will be hard pressed to organize 
effective political campaigns by April. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the parties are wary that the front could become entrenched 
if elections are delayed too long. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a difficult situation for all of us," Pop said. "The Romanian people 
have gotten accustomed to the idea that power becomes degraded. We are wary of 
this with the front, and we must be candid about it. We worry that the front 
might get too used to wielding power. We support the front, because it is good 
for maintaining order and stability. We need the front to get food to the 
people and to create and to guarantee the conditions for free elections. But 
that is all. We do not want to see the front overstepping its mandate." 
</P>
<P>
Pop said the Peasants Party also supports a draft election law that the front 
announced Thursday. It calls for the creation of a two-house national 
legislature and separation of executive, judicial and legislative powers. All 
political parties, excepting those deemed fascist, will be allowed to 
participate, and all will have equal and free access to radio, television and 
press, the front said. 
</P>
<P>
A public discussion on the election law will precede its adoption, according to 
Silviu Brucan, a member of the front's 11-man executive committee. Brucan said 
all political parties will be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need anything original in Romania," Pop said. "A clear, plain and 
simple democracy is what we need."

EAST EUROPE: WITH THE ECONOMY A SHAMBLES AND UNREST GROWING, THE COMMUNISTS ARE 
MEETING THIS WEEKEND TO CURB THEIR POWER, TRY OTHER REFORMS.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For decades, Yugoslavia was the pacesetter in political and economic reforms in 
Eastern Europe: It was the first Communist country to allow its citizens to 
travel freely abroad, and it had less of the looming police state that darkened 
most of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavians liked to say they were on "the sunny side of the Alps." Their 
country was independent, innovative and, after it broke from the Soviet Bloc in 
1948, mostly free from the shackles of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
In almost every way, from the wealth of goods in its shop windows to the hordes 
of topless Western European tourists on its Adriatic beaches, Yugoslavia felt 
better off than its Communist kin. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the amazing year of change in 1989. Today the relatively 
progressive country founded by Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the late Communist 
rebel who died 10 years ago this spring, finds itself suddenly lagging far 
behind its neighbors in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
"What we took 40 years to accomplish, they did in one month in Czechoslovakia," 
marveled Slavko Splichal, a sociologist from Ljubljana, in the northwest corner 
of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslavs look around and see that Albania is the only country left that 
is not moving," a Western diplomat here said. "Believe me, they do not like to 
be compared to Albania." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to catch up with the rest of Eastern Europe, the Yugoslav 
Communist Party is expected to relinquish its monopolistic hold on power and 
endorse other reforms at a special meeting here this weekend. But the congress 
of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia comes at a time when the country 
finds itself confronted with a panoply of very difficult challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's economy is in shambles, with an effective inflation rate topping 
2,000% last year. The foreign debt is more than $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Until the federal government finally made the Yugoslav dinar convertible into 
hard currency in December -- the first Eastern European country to take this 
important step -- daily life here often involved hours of complicated dealings 
with black-market money traders. 
</P>
<P>
Even more troubling, the nasty Balkan conflicts that gave the country its 
reputation as the "tinderbox of Europe" have resurfaced in a big way, spreading 
talk of secession and a breakup of the Yugoslav federation along the lines of 
the old Austro-Hungarian empire. 
</P>
<P>
In the most celebrated recent example of the internal feuding, the government 
of Serbia, the largest of the six republics in Yugoslavia, ordered an economic 
boycott of Slovenia, the richest Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
Populist Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic called the boycott after the 
Slovenian government blocked a pro-Serbian demonstration he planned in 
Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, on Dec. 1. Since then, some Serbian banks 
have refused to transfer funds to their Slovene counterparts. Popular items 
such as Slovenian mineral water and Coca-Cola, bottled in Slovenia, have 
disappeared from markets as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a political meeting of new opposition parties in Ljubljana on 
Wednesday, speaker after speaker urged greater autonomy, even independence, for 
Slovenia. The guests of honor at the rally were politicians from Austria and 
Italy, countries many Slovenes say they prefer to their own. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Yugoslavia has always been an improbable country. With six 
republics, two provinces, four languages, three religions and two alphabets, it 
defies most definitions of statehood. United as partisan fighters against the 
Germans during World War II, the Yugoslavs were kept together for 35 years 
under the leadership of Tito. 
</P>
<P>
But even Tito had to intervene with force to quell an ethnic-nationalist 
uprising in Croatia in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
After Tito's death in 1980, no other pan-Yugoslavian leader has emerged. 
Economic disparities between the republics -- Slovenia has a per-capita income 
three times higher than Serbia, for example -- has fostered jealousies. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional Communist Party leadership was hopelessly identified with 
failed economic schemes, a classic example of which was a nickel-alloy 
production facility in Macedonia. Built at a cost of $2 billion, the plant was 
never used because of a collapse in the world nickel market and because assays 
showed the nickel ore in the region, one of Yugoslavia's poorest, was not 
nearly rich enough to exploit profitably. 
</P>
<P>
In the place of the old Tito-style politicians, mostly Communists who favored a 
strong federal government, new regionally based leaders such as Milosevic have 
surfaced. Milosevic has won broad appeal by championing the plight of Serbian 
minorities in other republics and provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are 8 million Serbs in Yugoslavia, the largest ethnic group 
among the country's 25.5 million citizens, only 60% live in the republic of 
Serbia, with the rest scattered as minorities in other states. 
</P>
<P>
Rekindling an age-old flame for "a greater Serbian state," Milosevic used his 
power as Serbian Communist Party leader to subjugate Kosovo and Vojvodina, the 
two so-called autonomous provinces inside Serbia, because of what he claimed 
was persecution of Serbs there. 
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, where a majority of the population is Albanian, Milosevic ordered 
the arrest and prosecution of Albanian Communist Azem Vlasi, a move that has 
been widely criticized on human rights grounds in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Milosevic's Kosovo moves also frightened people in other republics where fears 
of Serbian dominance have existed for centuries. "The old maxim is that a 
strong Serbia means a weak Yugoslavia," one diplomat here said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he relinquished his job as head of the Serbian Communist Party when he 
was elected as president of the Serbian republic this fall, Milosevic is 
expected to be a key player behind the scenes when the four-day party congress 
opens today. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial issues to be debated at the party congress are the constitutionally 
ordained leadership role of the party; multi-party elections, and a proposal by 
Slovene Communists for a "League of Communist Leagues" in which each republic 
would have an equal vote instead of the population-based voting that now favors 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
According to most sources, the first two points already have been approved by 
the Communist leadership. At a news conference Friday, Yugoslavian Deputy Prime 
Minister Vivko Pregl preempted the party congress by announcing an eight-point 
proposal for reform, including an end to the party's domination of labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to change the leading role of the Communist Party," Pregl 
said. "We want to write in as much freedom as possible with regard to political 
affiliation."

New Delhi assumed control Friday of Jammu and Kashmir state after the 
resignation of its unpopular chief minister, but Muslim radicals said the 
change would not affect their bloody campaign to end Indian control of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of serious new violence or casualties in the state's 
northern region, although police said minor bombings and arson persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viswanath Pratap Singh's government declared "governor's rule" 
in the troubled Himalayan state after the swearing in of a new governor, 
Jagmohan, in the winter capital of Jammu, 100 miles south of the summer capital 
of Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's decision to name Jagmohan prompted the resignation late Thursday of 
Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, who said he was not consulted on appointment of 
the new governor. The governor is the central government's chief representative 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's Cabinet also quit. The state assembly was not dissolved but placed 
under "suspended animation." 
</P>
<P>
The state's predominantly Muslim Kashmir region has been rocked by an 
escalating campaign by Islamic militant groups to secede from predominantly 
Hindu India. Some groups demand independence, while others advocate accession 
to Pakistan, which disputes India's claim to Kashmir.

HEALTH: A STUDY SAYS THE NATION PAYS $50 BILLION A YEAR FOR EMISSIONS-CAUSED 
ILLNESSES. IT CALLS FOR STRICT NEW POLLUTION CONTROLS.

Air pollution from motor vehicles is responsible for $40 billion to $50 billion 
in annual health care expenditures and as many as 120,000 unnecessary or 
premature deaths, according to a series of studies released Friday by the 
American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, $40 billion was considered the high range," said James S. 
Cannon, an environmental analyst and one of the study authors. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, what used to be considered the high-range costs are now the mid-range 
costs," Cannon said. "In the past, we've understated, underestimated and 
under-recognized the costs of living in a polluted environment." 
</P>
<P>
The association said that the estimated annual health care costs associated 
with motor vehicle pollution extend from as little as $4 billion to as much as 
$93 billion, but it appears that $40 billion to $50 billion is the most 
realistic range. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, asserting that new controls on auto pollution are "feasible, 
cost-effective and necessary" to reduce the health consequences of air 
pollution, called for passage of clean air legislation expected to be taken up 
by the Senate when it returns to work next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's anti-pollution package is considerably tougher than a clean air 
initiative introduced last summer by the Bush Administration. The President has 
threatened to veto the Senate bill if it fails to balance environmental 
protection with economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the reports by the lung association represents an attempt to 
identify the costs associated with leaving the nation's clean air standards 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"The health and environmental need for more stringent vehicle controls can no 
longer be debated," said Michael P. Walsh, a former Environmental Protection 
Agency official who worked in the area of motor vehicle pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
"Substantial additional control of motor vehicles will be required to achieve 
the air quality objectives which are necessary to protect public health and the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Business Roundtable, which represents the nation's largest 
corporations, released a study saying that the Senate's clean air legislation 
would cost as much as $104 billion a year to implement. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Roundtable estimates, which do not mention the health care costs 
addressed by the American Lung Assn., included $25 billion to control toxic air 
emissions, $24 billion for urban smog and $5 billion for acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Roundtable study said California would bear the largest cost, at 
$11 billion a year, followed by Texas, $10.4 billion; Louisiana, $2.7 billion; 
Illinois, $2.6 billion; New York, $2.1 billion, and Tennessee, $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The American Lung Assn. estimated that the auto standards mandated in the 
Senate legislation for the year 2003 would reduce national emissions of 
smog-forming pollutants by more than 450,000 tons, at a cost of about $2,000 a 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the group said, the standards would result in a reduction of nearly 14 
million tons of carbon monoxide, at a cost of less than $250 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
The association noted that the provisions in the Senate bill "fall well short 
of the ambitious standards under consideration in California." 
</P>
<P>
One of the studies released by the American Lung Assn., conducted by UC Davis, 
estimated that between 50,000 and 120,000 deaths each year could be linked to 
the health effects of auto pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said that another study, funded by UC Fullerton, estimated that annual 
health care savings in California could be increased from an expected $9.4 
billion under current federal standards to $14.3 billion if California's 
proposed tougher standards are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon said he surveyed five years' worth of studies that attempted to express 
in dollars the extent of illness and premature death resulting from air 
pollution and concluded that "the price tag of pollution is rising." 
</P>
<P>
"In studies where direct comparison of the various economic effects was 
possible," he said, "health costs appeared as the most significant or among the 
most significant of the adverse economic repercussions of air pollution."

More than 700 United Mine Workers members, dressed in camouflage green to 
symbolize union solidarity, attended a funeral Friday for a coal miner who was 
shot on a picket line. 
</P>
<P>
The miners packed a funeral home chapel to pay their respects to John McCoy, 
42, a union miner from Premier who was shot Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mourners, who arrived from Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
Virginia and West Virginia, wore camouflage green, which became a symbol of 
union militancy and solidarity during last year's nine-month strike in three 
states against Pittston Coal Group. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's death occurred in a union dispute with Regency Industries Inc. and a 
handful of other companies that work in southern West Virginia. McCoy was 
employed by a subsidiary of A. T. Massey Coal, the target of a bitter UMW 
strike in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy and two other miners were shot as they approached a picket site, and the 
assailants are still unknown, state police said. The other two victims were 
still in the hospital Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's body was taken to a remote cemetery seven miles outside of Welch for a 
formal UMW burial. At the site, fellow members placed sprigs of evergreen on 
the casket.

BARRY CHARGED WITH CRACK COCAINE POSSESSION; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: THE MAYOR'S LAWYER SAYS HE WILL PLEAD NOT GUILTY. AN FBI AGENT SAYS 
BLOOD AND URINE TESTS WERE POSITIVE.

<P>
A subdued but seemingly unfazed District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry was 
charged Friday with possessing crack cocaine, a misdemeanor offense that 
carries a jail sentence of up to one year. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who has repeatedly denied allegations of drug use, shrugged off 
questions after formal presentation of the charges before a U.S. magistrate. 
"I'm going to leave here and go about the business of running government," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, said the 53-year-old mayor would plead not guilty 
and seek a jury trial. U.S. Magistrate Deborah A. Robinson allowed Barry to 
remain free on his own recognizance and set another court appearance for Feb. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued later by the mayor's office said Barry was turning over his 
day-to-day "duties and functions" to City Administrator Carol Thompson while 
retaining authority to sign and veto legislation and approve contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure my friends, colleagues, supporters, fellow citizens, the 
business community and the nation that this government will continue to operate 
at maximum performance," Barry said in the statement. "I have a team of 
competent professionals who will continue to run the affairs of government 
while I devote some time to my legal case." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI surveillance team filmed Barry on Thursday night smoking crack, which he 
purchased from a "cooperating witness" in a downtown Washington hotel room, FBI 
agent Ronald D. Stern said in an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Barry put some of the crack cocaine in a smoking apparatus, lit the crack 
cocaine and smoked it," Stern said. "Through a surveillance camera, I observed 
Mr. Barry take possession of the crack cocaine and inhale on the lit smoking 
apparatus. After observing Mr. Barry possess and use crack cocaine, I and other 
special agents entered the hotel room and arrested Mr. Barry." 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents and policemen took Barry into custody so that blood and urine 
samples could be obtained under a search warrant, and both "showed evidence of 
cocaine ingestion," Stern said in the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
At the government's request, the magistrate ordered Barry to appear at the 
federal courthouse every Monday to take a weekly urinalysis. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the "cooperative witness" was a woman friend whom Barry 
had put up at various Washington hotels over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, identified by the sources as Rasheeda Moore, decided to cooperate 
with the FBI after she developed "problems of her own" with a federal grand 
jury that has been investigating Barry and public corruption in the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents baby-sat with Moore's three children while she took part in the 
operation, a government source said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's wife, Effi, entered and left the courthouse holding her husband's arm 
during Friday's arraignment, but she made no comment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens, whose office oversees the continuing corruption 
probe, called Barry's arrest "a personal tragedy for the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
"But narcotics abuse is also a tragedy for this city," Stephens said. 
"Narcotics abuse is not a victimless crime." 
</P>
<P>
Stephens and other law enforcement officials defended the elaborate undercover 
scheme used to arrest Barry on a misdemeanor offense by noting that it was part 
of an ongoing public corruption probe and that additional charges are possible. 
</P>
<P>
In previous grand jury testimony, Barry has denied using cocaine. Establishing 
that he is a user could support a perjury charge, one law enforcement source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another law enforcement source said the undercover operation had been "under 
contemplation for a long time" by the FBI and Stephens, who weighed the 
potential advantages and disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
"There was strong intelligence that the mayor has a drug abuse problem," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney denied that Barry had been targeted because he is a black 
mayor who has alienated many white residents of Washington. "There is 
absolutely no basis for that allegation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens also rejected the suggestion that the sting operation was a form of 
entrapment. "Where there is predisposition (to violate the law), there is not 
entrapment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another source said Barry was recorded in a conversation with Moore in which he 
first raised the subject of crack, a highly addictive substance, and asked 
whether she had any for him. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest occurred only three days before Barry's scheduled announcement of 
his candidacy for a fourth term as mayor, an announcement that now has been 
postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
But Stephens said the timing of the operation in relation to Barry's campaign 
plans was coincidental and instead reflected the availability of the 
cooperating witness to participate in the action. 
</P>
<P>
It was "that investigative imperative" that led to the sting operation, he 
said. "He (Barry) went in with his own limousine, with his own bodyguards," 
Stephens said. "He came to the Vista Hotel on his own free will." 
</P>
<P>
Stephens' predecessor as U.S. attorney, Joseph E. diGenova, considered but 
rejected a similar sting operation against Barry, a former law enforcement 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was turned down because of concerns that the public could consider the 
tactic unfair and part of a campaign to harass Barry. 
</P>
<P>
The source noted, however, that the decision was made more than a year before 
Charles Lewis, a former city employee and friend of Barry, told a federal judge 
that he had supplied the mayor with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
An hour after Barry's court appearance, Lewis was sentenced to 15 months in 
prison on cocaine conspiracy charges, after prosecutors praised his 
cooperation. Lewis has appeared twice before the grand jury probing Barry's 
alleged drug use and other corruption. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin told Lewis that he had been prepared to 
sentence him to 18 months. But Sporkin said he reduced the sentence because 
"the government has impressed me with the extent of your cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's arrest of Barry and the continuing investigation culminates a 
history of legal troubles that began shortly after his reelection to a second 
term as mayor in 1982. Barry was reelected again in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries into the financial activities of the mayor's Administration yielded 
the convictions of 11 city officials, including a top Barry aide, Ivanhoe 
Donaldson, and a former D.C. deputy mayor, Alphonse G. Hill, for financial 
crimes involving the city. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, a Democrat, called the federal investigations led by diGenova, who was 
appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, an attempt by the Republican 
Administration to "lynch black people another way." 
</P>
<P>
The first allegations that Barry used cocaine surfaced in 1983 after local news 
reports said the mayor had taken the drug during a December, 1981, party at a 
Washington nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, federal prosecutors said they had obtained a taped conversation of 
Karen Johnson, a convicted cocaine dealer with whom Barry admitted having a 
"personal" relationship, acknowledging that she sold cocaine to the mayor 20 to 
30 times. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with a 
major cocaine trafficking and money laundering ring, refused to tell the grand 
jury investigating Barry whether she used drugs or sold them to the mayor. She 
was jailed for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators revived their inquiries in December, 1988, after Barry 
repeatedly visited the Ramada Inn room of Lewis, the former city employee and 
Barry friend. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a tip that Lewis was selling drugs from the hotel room, police 
officers arrived to make an arrest. But police officials called off the mission 
after learning that Barry was in the room with Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Barry has argued forcefully that he has been the victim of 
"McCarthyism" similar to the red-baiting tactics used by the late Sen. Joseph 
McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
He has blamed the media for hyping his problems and has said he is a victim of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
"My record is clear and clean that I have no need to engage in illegal drug 
use, have never done so, don't intend to do so," Barry said last September. 
"What we have is the new McCarthyism . . . . There doesn't have to be any 
evidence or credible collaboration; someone just says it and it takes on a life 
of its own."

If only for a day, the nation's capital had an afternoon newspaper Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"BUSTED," said the 2 1/2-inch headline above the lead stories in a special 
edition of the Washington Times that chronicled the arrest of District of 
Columbia Mayor Marion Barry on drug charges. Most of the 24-page edition was 
devoted to Barry's arrest at a downtown hotel Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the Washington Star folded in 1981 had residents of the area seen a 
local afternoon newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The "EXTRA!" was sold by hawkers outside the rival Washington Post; the 
District Building, Washington's city hall; the Vista International Hotel, where 
Barry was arrested, and at downtown subway stations, said Linda Clark, a 
spokeswoman for the Times, a morning paper published Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The lead stories outlined how Barry was apprehended as part of an FBI sting 
operation, contained information concerning his arraignment and had comments 
from a news conference held by U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the special edition contained comments from elementary school students 
and residents of the city along with an editorial and a column on Barry's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called its afternoon edition "Special Report: The Barry Crackup." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the news of Barry's arrest made the front pages Friday of all major 
newspapers in Bogota, Colombia, the center of the world cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
El Espectador, a newspaper that has long crusaded against the drug trade and 
was bombed by traffickers several months ago, ran a photograph of Barry at the 
top of its front page with the caption: "Drug-Addict Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Another photo inside showed Barry along with former New York Mayor Edward I. 
Koch and Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana at an anti-drug mayors' meeting last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The other major Bogota daily, El Tiempo, ran a front-page story under the 
headline: "Black mayor of Washington arrested buying cocaine."

Investigators say they have recovered more than $500,000 in stolen antiques -- 
including two centuries-old violins and a sword reportedly used by Civil War 
Gen. William T. Sherman.

The merchandise, which included books, coin collections, toy cars and guns, was 
found Thursday in a storage locker.

Police have arrested 29 people since a grand jury in Columbus, Ohio, returned 
secret indictments on Jan. 2 in connection with an Ohio-based burglary ring, 
but no arrests involving the Savannah cache have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman-related items, which included a portrait of the Union general, were 
stolen from the museum at Sherman's birthplace in Lancaster, Ohio, 
investigators said.

SHUTTLE'S LANDING DELAYED AGAIN -- COMPUTER AT FAULT

Mission Control told Columbia's astronauts shortly before midnight Friday to 
delay their landing at least 95 minutes because of a problem in the spaceship's 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
The "wave-off" call came just 25 minutes before Commander Daniel Brandenstein 
was to fire braking rockets to start the spaceship on an hourlong dive through 
through the atmosphere to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown, which had been set for 12:01 a.m. PST was rescheduled for 1:36 a.m., 
after Columbia made one more swing around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Control reported there was a switching problem in a backup computer and 
the new landing time was dependent on a resolution of the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In normal configuration Columbia has four primary computers working and one 
backup. The control center said it was reconfiguring the system to shift one of 
the operating units to the backup. 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship could operate with just two computers operating. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle and its five astronauts had planned to return home Friday morning, 
but the landing was waved off first by one orbit and then by a day because of a 
threat of fog that proved to be real at Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was favorable for this morning in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit until at least 
Monday, NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts had a light day Friday, working on a couple of experiments and 
snapping some more photographs of Earth before going to bed around noon. 
</P>
<P>
They were awakened Friday evening to the strains of "Anchors Aweigh" for 
shuttle commander Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee, both Navy men, and the 
fight song for the University of Wisconsin at River Falls, Brandenstein's alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning Columbia. We'd like to know what it feels like to be record 
setters," Mission Control said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a loss for words," Brandenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time they were awakened. Their sleep was interrupted in the 
afternoon when an alarm sounded, indicating there was briefly too much nitrogen 
in the nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere inside the shuttle.

The long-awaited launching of the Hubble Space Telescope will be delayed from 
March to April because of a problem with one of the shuttle Discovery's solid 
fuel booster rockets, NASA officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.7-billion telescope is expected to become astronomy's most significant 
tool in expanding knowledge of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
It will look seven times more deeply into space and detect objects one-fiftieth 
as bright as those seen by the best ground-based observatory. 
</P>
<P>
The space agency said shuttle managers decided to exchange one of the motor 
segments on the right booster rocket because there was a question as to whether 
a check was done properly. Assembly operations have advanced to the point where 
the test cannot be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The launching was scheduled for March 26. Estimates of the delay range from 10 
days to two weeks.

THIRD CRAFT DIVERTED EASTERN PILOT'S ATTENTION BEFORE HE HIT PLANE

The pilot of an Eastern Airlines jetliner that crashed into a smaller plane did 
not see it on the runway until the last minute because he had been watching 
another jetliner that landed in front of them, federal investigators said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A Continental Airlines jetliner had been cleared to land on the same runway 
ahead of the twin-engine Beechcraft Air King, which was struck from behind by 
the Eastern Boeing 727-200, said Robert MacIntosh, a National Transportation 
Safety Board investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The accident at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport late Thursday killed 
the pilot of the smaller plane and injured the co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern jet, which was rolling down the runway at 120 m.p.h., sheared off 
the roof of the twin-propeller plane, which was owned by Epps Air Service and 
based at a suburban airport, authorities said. There were no injuries to the 
141 passengers and 8 crew members aboard the Eastern plane. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Eastern jet collided with the Beechcraft, the air traffic controller 
had told the Continental pilot to stop between runways after he had cleared the 
airport's northernmost runway, MacIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
All three planes had been cleared to land on the runway, and all three pilots 
were tuned to the same radio frequency with the controller, he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacIntosh said the controller told the Eastern pilot, 23-year veteran Ralph 
Orlando, that he had his plane in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that transmission, the controller asked the pilot of the 
Continental plane to "hold short" of the parallel runway, an order MacIntosh 
said meant that the plane should stop between the two runways. He said 
investigators had not determined why that order was given. 
</P>
<P>
The Continental pilot, who was not identified, did not immediately acknowledge 
the instruction, and the tower controllers discussed among themselves whether 
they thought the pilot had heard it, MacIntosh said. Shortly thereafter, the 
Eastern pilot reported having hit the Beechcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The captain (of the Eastern flight) stated he had been looking down the runway 
in some awareness of the Continental. He saw the tail of the (Beechcraft) 
aircraft a very short time before impact," MacIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
MacIntosh said that investigators would spend the weekend examining the cockpit 
recorder tapes and studying the distances between the planes, the approaches of 
the planes and the controller's conduct.

CRANSTON SEEKING WAY FOR LINCOLN INVESTORS TO SUE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston indicated Friday he will seek to forge a path so that 
jilted bond holders of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan can make a claim against U.S. 
taxpayers for their losses, which are figured at $200 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a new campaign to take the political offensive in the scandal of 
Lincoln's collapse, the beleaguered Cranston held press conferences in Los 
Angeles and San Diego to insist that federal regulators were culpable in the 
sale of bonds to more than 22,000 Californians -- bonds that now are believed 
to be worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Bond holders have said that they wrongly believed the investments they bought 
at Lincoln branch offices were backed by federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The four-term, 75-year-old senator is struggling for his political survival as 
a result of the Lincoln collapse, in which his intervention with federal 
regulators on Lincoln's behalf has drawn heavy criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said regulators, under Edwin J. Gray, the former head of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, "had overall responsibility for examining the sale of 
uninsured bonds at Lincoln Savings -- and he had responsibility for stopping 
the sale if it was improper." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Cranston said, the foundation exists "for claims by the unfortunate 
bond holders against the United States government," in the event the bonds 
cannot be covered by the assets of the bankrupted Lincoln, its holding company, 
American Continental Corp., and its chairman, Charles H. Keating. 
</P>
<P>
But federal law is complicated in this area, and Cranston acknowledged that he 
believes bond holders do not have the right to sue the U.S. Treasury, at least 
not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's a step that may be dealt with," said Cranston. "I'll have more to 
say on that shortly." It was the second time in a week that Cranston told the 
bond holders to hang tight, offering them some hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was asked how the bond holders could come to have the opportunity to 
sue the government in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"One way could be legislation to grant them that right. I'm considering that. 
I'll have an announcement on that shortly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He scheduled a press conference on the subject for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston seemed at pains, though, to keep bond holders from hoping for too 
much, too fast. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not at all sure that the restitution of lost savings could be 
accomplished by 1992, when he will run for reelection. "It is impossible to get 
an instant solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond holders already have sued the state government, seeking restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's troubles in the Lincoln debacle stem from the acceptance of $850,000 
from Keating by voter registration committees linked to the senator and his 
acceptance of $47,000 in campaign contributions. Cranston later intervened on 
Lincoln's behalf before federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston had previously asked the General Accounting Office to determine 
whether U.S. taxpayers were liable for the losses suffered by the people who 
invested their savings in Lincoln bonds. Last month, the GAO declined to offer 
an opinion while the bond holders still had claims pending against Lincoln. But 
the GAO noted that there is no provision in the law requiring taxpayer 
restitution for such high-risk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, on Friday Cranston said he had reviewed the facts in the case and 
concluded that U.S. government regulators had failed in their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston rejects any blame for Lincoln's collapse. He insists that he sought 
only to bring to a conclusion, one way or another, a long-running audit of the 
troubled savings and loan. Federal regulators said Cranston and four other 
senators who received Keating contributions and joined in the intervention were 
applying undue pressure on the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
For months the Lincoln mess has drained Cranston's political support, as 
measured by polls, and has encouraged any number of fellow Democratic 
politicians to plot primary election challenges against him. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Cranston, No. 2 in leadership in the Senate and one familiar with 
the bare-knuckles style of campaigning, began an audacious comeback effort. He 
began personalizing the dispute as one between himself and the then-chief 
regulator, Gray, and said regulators were trying to blame the senators to cover 
their own bungling.

POOR'S CARE COSTS ILLEGALLY SHIFTED TO COUNTY, COURT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A California Court of Appeal ruled Friday that the state illegally shifted the 
costs of indigent health care to the counties and that state officials must 
provide up to $400 million annually in added funding to aid hundreds of 
thousands of low-income adults. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel held unanimously that the Legislature violated the state 
Constitution in 1982 by transferring financial responsibility for care to the 
counties without providing enough funding for adequate services. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Gann Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1980 under 
Proposition 4, the state may not avoid the amendment's spending limits by 
shifting the costs of new programs or higher levels of services to the local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court, ruling in a case from Alameda County, held that the shift of 
a large portion of the costs of medical indigent care to the counties 
constituted a "state-mandated new program" and that the counties must be 
reimbursed for the costs they were forced to assume. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case and state officials agreed that the decision, if upheld, 
could result in hundreds of millions of dollars annually for Los Angeles and 
other counties currently hard-pressed to provide health services for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The state will be obligated to rectify this tremendous under-funding of 
medical care for literally hundreds of thousands of people in California," said 
Lois Salisbury of Public Advocates Inc. in San Francisco, an attorney for a 
group of taxpayers and aid-seekers who challenged the fund-shift in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury said that in 1982, when the shift first occurred, the state provided 
about $520 million annually to the counties, representing about 70 cents of 
every dollar to be spent on indigent health care. Now, only $450 million 
annually is being provided, the state's share has dwindled to 40 cents on the 
dollar, and many counties are unable to provide adequate care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Health care officials throughout Los Angeles County applauded the ruling, 
saying that the state's decision to shift the burden onto the county has 
contributed largely to the breakdown in the trauma system and created 
overcrowding at emergency rooms and community health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, the county's health department chief, said that if the state were 
to restore the funding, it would return approximately $150 to $200 million 
annually to the county's financially strapped health care system. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Asher Rubin, representing the state officials named as 
defendants in the taxpayers' suit, called the ruling "a shocking blow" to the 
legislative process. The appeals court improperly interfered with the 
Legislature's prerogative to establish a new system of financing care in the 
wake of the Gann Amendment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision that has tremendous fiscal ramifications for the state," 
Rubin said. "We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a year. . . . 
But you have to bear in mind the money ultimately will come out of the pockets 
of the taxpayers or the hides of other state programs. There's no free lunch. 
This decision does not generate new money." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said state officials plan to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme 
Court. If it is appealed, state high court action in the case could come by 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the case said that if the ruling is not overturned, the state 
could meet the requirements of the decision either by providing additional 
funds directly to the counties or offering medically indigent adults coverage 
under the state's Medi-Cal program.

STATE OFFICIALS FEEL VINDICATED AFTER NEW STUDY ARGUES AGAINST ASBESTOS REMOVAL 
</P>

<P>
State officials, criticized in the past for moving too slowly with asbestos 
removal, welcomed a new scientific study Friday that concludes asbestos cleanup 
is often more dangerous than simply ignoring the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with estimates that asbestos abatement in public schools could cost 
billions of dollars, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig said 
the new findings call for a more cautious -- and less costly -- approach to 
dealing with the hazardous fibers. 
</P>
<P>
"By going and trying to do something about it, you may make it more dangerous," 
said Honig. "You may have to take a re-look at what has to be done, and 
sometimes the best thing to do is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the office of the state architect, which oversees most state 
structures, said the study published in the journal Science corresponds with 
the agency's program of locating asbestos in state buildings and then, in most 
cases, leaving it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to see the report appears to coincide with the method of operation 
of this office," said Kenneth McClellan, chief of special programs for the 
state architect's office. "We don't want to do any abatement that could expose 
people to fibers." 
</P>
<P>
But some critics say the state has been motivated less by health concerns than 
money and has been lax in carrying out its asbestos program. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive study concluded that leaving asbestos in place often poses 
less of a hazard than removing it, particularly to workers who take part in the 
cleanup. The report also found that the type of asbestos most commonly used in 
building materials, chrysotile asbestos, poses fewer health risks than other 
forms of the mineral. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District were 
optimistic that the latest findings would relieve pressure to remove asbestos 
at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done things where we really feel there's an overkill," said Margaret 
Scholl, maintenance director for the district. "It's become a motherhood issue, 
and how can anyone be for asbestos? It's become a political issue rather than a 
health issue." 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, school districts nationwide have been required to spend 
millions of dollars on asbestos abatement even in cases where local officials 
believed there was no health threat. 
</P>
<P>
In California, districts have been left to find their own funding, often 
diverting money from instructional programs. But many parents, concerned that 
their children were being exposed to life-threatening fibers, have criticized 
schools and the state for neglecting asbestos hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Every school district is in a panic because they don't have the money to do 
the work the law is requiring," said Richard Henry, asbestos technical 
supervisor for the Los Angeles district. "Perhaps it's money that doesn't need 
to be spent and can be spent on education." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Los Angeles school district has spent nearly $20 million on its 
asbestos program. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education said there is no tally of how much money has 
been spent on asbestos abatement by the state's school districts. Estimates for 
asbestos inspection and cleanup in the public schools range from $1 billion to 
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"School districts spent a lot of money to take care of this problem and now it 
turns out some of that money has been unwisely spent," said Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Before recommending that schools curtail their asbestos programs, Honig said he 
will call on his staff to examine the study conducted by researchers at Yale, 
Johns Hopkins and several other universities. "We're not yet advising schools 
to hold up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state architect's office surveyed 12,000 state structures and found 
asbestos in 50,000 locations, McClellan said. Cleanup work was carried out in 
63 of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the 12,000 buildings, he said, the fibers were not in a hazardous 
condition and were dealt with simply by warning maintenance workers of the 
problem and carrying out regular inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Steffen, a former analyst with the Assembly Office of Research, said 
that under Gov. George Deukmejian, the state has done little to deal with the 
problem of asbestos in its buildings ever since officials discovered it would 
cost $1 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he added, the latest study appears to be a sort of vindication for the 
Administration's inaction. "They're being rewarded for being lax on the job," 
said Steffen, chief of staff for Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South S.F.).

MCMARTIN LAWSUITS MAY GO ON FOR YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in 
acquittals, a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach 
molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for 
decades, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
A confusing array of civil actions await resolution. These include a federal 
civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers 
and others; a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station 
and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability 
insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother, said 
his attorney, Scott Bernstein. And an attorney representing several parents of 
McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school 
for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced this case will never end," Eli Gauna, who represents Babette 
Spitler, a former teacher at the school, said wearily. "It will always be 
there, until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies." 
</P>
<P>
In the criminal case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. 
history -- Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were 
acquitted Thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who 
attended the family nursery school in Manhattan Beach. The jury deadlocked on 
13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations. A 
decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled 
against Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was a high mark, but not the final moment, in a lengthy and 
entangled legal saga. The criminal case began in March, 1984, when seven 
McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of 
molestation. The indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of 208 
counts of molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial. 
Defendants included Buckey; his mother; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who 
was the school founder; his sister Peggy Ann Buckey; and teachers Spitler, 
Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson. But a week after the hearing ended, Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing 
"incredibly weak evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the criminal case went to trial, civil litigation already was in 
the works. In 1984, a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking 
monetary damages against the school for medical bills, cost of psychiatric 
therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations. But those 
lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories 
from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Mooney, an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs, explained that 
during the criminal preliminary hearing, defense attorneys had sought 
psychiatric records of the alleged victims. Defense attorneys argued that they 
should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their 
patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their 
psychiatric histories would be at issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the 
criminal case," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Friday, however, that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled. Mooney 
said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide 
what to do with the 13 remaining criminal counts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue," Mooney said. 
"Somewhere between a handful and a bushelful." 
</P>
<P>
Any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children. The 
parents could not seek damages on their own, because the one-year statute of 
limitations -- the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed -- has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, children who allege abuse have until they are 19 years old to 
file. Many of the children who attended McMartin are now entering their early 
teens, but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts, however, say some courts have held that child abuse victims can 
file at any time in their life. In the so-called delayed-discovery theory, a 
statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes 
aware of molestation, and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility that hangs over the former defendants," said attorney 
Gauna, noting a recent landmark California court decision that set aside the 
statute of limitations for certain victims. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney said he knows of families that, seeking legal advantage, waited for the 
criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action. He explained that some 
families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than 
in a criminal case: the burden of proof in civil litigation is the 
preponderance of the evidence, not reasonable doubt, as in a criminal trial. 
Also, in a civil case, only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict. 
Criminal convictions require unanimous juries. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings 
is yet to be seen. And some families question whether the McMartin defendants' 
insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been any decisions yet. The parents need a little space between 
the events of this week and deciding what they will do," Mooney said. "There is 
some sentiment that says, 'Let's just put this behind us.' But there is also 
sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the 
criminal case left off. 
</P>
<P>
"They heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the 
children. They think maybe since the criminal jury couldn't get the higher 
standard of proof, a civil jury would bring about a resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Said one McMartin attendee's parent, who asked not to be identified: "I might 
be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child. But there 
apparently isn't any money there to be had." The only other reasons for filing 
such a suit, the parent added, would be "to work through a lot of emotional 
things, and we have already done that by participating in the criminal 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Gauna, Spitler's attorney, said the litigation will go on because "maybe a 
half-dozen to a dozen hard-line parents won't let it go away. They will live 
this case until the day they die." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the 
early defendants. Peggy Ann Buckey, Virginia McMartin, Spitler and Raidor are 
suing the television station, the reporter who broke the McMartin story and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the station and reporter, Wayne Satz, were "creating 
rather than reporting the news." A lower court held that the station, KABC, was 
protected from the action on constitutional grounds, but a state appellate 
court ruled the case should proceed to trial, and the state Supreme Court 
upheld that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The case, now in the early pretrial stages, is being watched closely, because 
it could set precedent in the field of press law, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Another suit pits former McMartin defendants and the pre-school against their 
liability insurance carriers. The McMartin side alleges that the insurance 
carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills. 
</P>
<P>
While the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs, they contend the 
defendants should have used only one attorney. However, the defendants are 
arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest, each needed their own 
counsel. One of the former defendants, preschool teacher Maryann Jackson,

<P>
As it becomes apparent that McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, 
parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign 
themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave 
behind. Soon, some of the children will be able to make their own legal 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Noted one parent: "It's really not our decision as parents anymore. These 
children will soon be adults."

NICHOLLS-TO-RANGERS TRADE SEEMS LIKELY

The Kings and the New York Rangers are expected to make a deal for center 
Bernie Nicholls within the next 24 hours. The proposed trade would send Tomas 
Sandstrom and Tony Granato, both right wingers and both 25, to the Kings for 
Nicholls, 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment," King General Manager Rogie Vachon said from his Los Angeles 
home Friday night. "There is no deal now. I'm not denying anything. There is 
certainly something in the works, but I can't say it is finalized. Yes, we've 
been talking to the Rangers. We've been going back and forth with proposals and 
everything is on the table now." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Baumgartner, a former teammate of Nicholls in Los Angeles who plays for the 
New York Islanders, said in today's editions of Newsday: "He had a bad month, 
and all of a sudden he's on the block. I don't see how he fell out of favor. 
Any other place, if you get in a slump, they'll let you get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But there, they are in such a hurry to win, they make more moves. Maybe 
they're still looking for that European player (as Sandstrom is) to play with 
Wayne. And Granato has that speed." 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner was traded by the Kings to the Islanders earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed the trade has been held up while Nicholls underwent minor 
bladder surgery Friday. The Rangers wanted to make sure there were no medical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls was scheduled to play in Sunday's All-Star game here. He was ticketed 
to fly out of Los Angeles Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll go if he feels up to it," Vachon said. "I left it up to him. He was 
going to see how he felt." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls is coming off his best season. He scored 70 goals, becoming only the 
fifth player in NHL history to do so. He also totaled 150 points a year ago, 
his seventh full season with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has 27 goals and 48 assists for 75 points, but recently, 
bothered by several nagging injuries, he has slumped, failing to score a goal 
since New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
That coincided with a Kings' slide all the way to fourth place in the Smythe 
Division. They were 0-6-1 since the start of the year before beating the 
Detroit Red Wings, 9-4, Thursday night. Nicholls had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' problems caused their owner, Bruce McNall, to publicly promise big 
changes. Now, a big change may be at hand.

MELVIN DURLSLAG: WITH ELWAY, THEY HAVE OUTSIDE SHOT AT UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURLSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Switching one day to the field of letters, comedian Dick Martin authored the 
American masterpiece, titled, "With a Daiquiri and a Beautiful Girl, a Guy Can 
Get Romantic in Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
You reflect on this today since those in Cleveland have ample time for romance, 
removed as they are from the tournament to settle the football championship of 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
And who was chiefly responsible for removing them? A cad from Stanford named 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that guys went to Stanford to marry for position, winding up 
senior partner in their father-in-law's brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
But this Elway goes into business for himself, a specialist in the science of 
scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to scramble, you bum, why don't you find work as a fry cook?" 
comes the cry from the Cleveland Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
The Dawg Pound is an area in Cleveland Stadium where inhabitants throw dog 
biscuits at visiting players, who are sorry to see the throwers give up their 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
But Elway brings to Cleveland immense sadness, especially to the Cleveland 
coach, Bud Carson, whose wounds have yet to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"How can San Francisco put a handle on this guy?" Carson is asked, with 
reference to the Super Bowl matching the 49ers with Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't know it but we had a plan to contain him," he answers glumly. "We 
were going to prevent him from getting outside. We were going to hit him as 
frequently as possible. And we were going to play possession football, keeping 
the ball out of his hands." 
</P>
<P>
"What worked?" Bud is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We went zero for three. He got outside. We didn't hit him. And we didn't keep 
the ball. It wasn't one of our better days, but the plan we developed going in 
is the basic way to stop Elway." 
</P>
<P>
Among clubs facing this unique performer, the fear of his slipping outside the 
rush is uppermost. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets loose, there is no way to deal with Denver, no way for your 
defenders to figure what's coming," Carson explains. "Elway himself doesn't 
know what's going to happen. He starts running and looking until he sees 
something. And he has the kind of arm that can get the ball to what he sees. In 
the defense, meantime, there is total breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
Like most coaches, Carson prefers a tidy game, one in which the attack comes at 
you in an orderly way. But once Elway gets around the rush and starts running, 
he terrorizes the opposing sideline, aware that its defenders are neutralized, 
reduced to guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Do rushers have instructions on how to keep him in the pocket?" you ask 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"Studying Elway's habits, you find that a rusher reaching for him has a better 
chance nailing him by grabbing at the back of his shoulder, not the front," he 
answers. "You grab at the front and he spins out and slips outside. You are not 
dealing with a frail creature. This is a very strong man who weighs 215." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to deal at least twice a season with Elway, the Raiders embrace the old 
Joe Namath theory on the relativity of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks make good viewing, Joe always contended. They are pulled off in the open, 
fully on camera. But, tactically, they are secondary to the simple, less 
dramatic hit, more frequently applied. 
</P>
<P>
A quarterback needn't be sacked to reduce him as a weapon. The cumulative 
effect of legal hits that aren't necessarily sacks begins to tell as the game 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"The brain keeps count," Namath used to say. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders always attempt to slow down Elway with this stratagem, and it was 
Cleveland's aim last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We 'dogged him all day," Carson says. "We not only didn't hit him, but got 
burned on passes to undefended receivers." 
</P>
<P>
In the Super Bowl, Carson sees a quarterback match of broadly different breeds. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, Joe Montana is a very orderly worker," he says. "He runs a 
traditional possession attack. A lot of short passes, blended with runs. The 
other guy runs a crapshoot, as unorthodox as any quarterback you ever will 
see." 
</P>
<P>
That the Super Bowl is played on neutral grounds is, in Carson's judgment, a 
major asset to a championship event. 
</P>
<P>
But he would favor conference championships on neutral fields, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If Denver had come to Cleveland last Sunday, it would have experienced the 
same disadvantage we did in Denver," he says. "When you can't hear, you can't 
play your game. Conference championships are very important. You would have 
fairer games on neutral fields." 
</P>
<P>
One of these days, a rich owner whose forces are in the Super Bowl is going to 
buy up, at scalpers' rates, 50,000 or so tickets and disperse them to his 
team's fans, creating enough crowd noise to be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Blowing $25 million, he will shrug, reminding you of the words of Nelson Bunker 
Hunt as the banks were closing in: "A billion isn't what it used to be."

NEWSWIRE: FIVE BASKETBRAWLERS ARE PUT ON PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five members of the North Carolina A&amp;T basketball team were put on 
probation Friday for their part in a brawl in which seven people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The five players will be allowed to play in the next game. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, if a player is involved in a first-offense fight, he is 
placed on a one-game probation. A second fight results in a one-game suspension 
and a third means suspension for an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina A&amp;T Coach Don Corbett said at a news conference Friday that 
he would review videotape of Thursday night's home game against North Carolina 
Central, and would determine if further action is necessary. No action has been 
taken by North Carolina Central. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people -- two city police officers, one campus security officer and four 
students -- were treated for cuts and bruises and released, said a spokeswoman 
for Moses Cone Memorial Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"My first recollection was somebody left Central's bench without a uniform on," 
Moss said. "I saw the guy leave the bench and then everybody got involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to look at the game film to see who ran onto the floor from each bench 
because there's a rule about that."

The San Francisco Giants have signed free-agent veteran catcher Gary Carter to 
a one-year contract, the club announced. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 35, is an 11-time All-Star selection and a career .265 hitter with 304 
home runs in 15 major league seasons, but he had a poor season last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carter hit just .183 with two home runs and 15 runs batted in while playing in 
a career-low 50 games for the New York Mets. He was sidelined for much of the 
season because of an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will pay Carter $250,000 guaranteed, $250,000 if he is on the 
opening-day roster, and $100,000 for playing in 50 games. He gets an additional 
$100,000 for playing in 60, 70, 80, 90 and 110 games.

EAGLE TACKLE HELLER SUES BAKER, VIKINGS FOR EYE INJURY IN 1988

The Minnesota Vikings and former Viking player Al (Bubba) Baker were sued 
Friday by Philadelphia Eagle offensive tackle Ron Heller over an eye injury 
Heller suffered during a game in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Sieben Jr., a Minneapolis attorney who filed the suit in Hennepin County 
District Court, said the case involves "gross negligence, aggravated conduct 
and reckless disregard of the rights of another person." 
</P>
<P>
Sieben alleged the Vikings were negligent in supervising and training Baker. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which seeks in excess of $50,000, alleges Baker poked Heller in the 
eye in an altercation in the second quarter of a Sept. 25, 1988 game, causing 
permanent injury to Heller's left cornea. Heller was hospitalized for five 
days, but was able to play the rest of the 1988 season and was a regular this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, now with the Cleveland Browns, was served papers at his home in 
Westlake, Ohio.

SIMMONS CLOSES IN ON 3,000 POINTS 
</P>

Everyone likes Lionel. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Simmons, who started the college basketball season as a probable lottery 
pick in the next NBA draft and has done nothing since to lower his stock, has 
admirers everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The people at La Salle know they would never have gotten out of the local 
shadow of Villanova and Temple, on to network television, and into the homes of 
other blue-chip recruits without the four-year heroics of Simmons, a 6-foot-7 
senior forward who is on pace to become only the fifth player in NCAA history 
to score 3,000 career points. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, a lesser-known league on 
the East Coast, are ecstatic with the attention Simmons and La Salle are 
getting. Baltimore's Loyola might not have joined the MAAC last year were it 
not for the residual benefits of Simmons' high profile, but the Greyhounds 
could have second thoughts after playing the No. 17-ranked Explorers next 
Monday at the Philadelphia Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Southwark Plaza, a mean streets housing project in south 
Philadelphia, revere Simmons as a folk hero. Employees of the Philadelphia 
Housing Authority honored him before last month's win over Villanova, just for 
getting up and out of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too many people go down there," teammate Doug Overton said. "We play all 
over the city in the summer, but that's one place I've never played." 
</P>
<P>
The people on opposing teams respect Simmons. Sure, Digger Phelps is a public 
relations genius, but the Notre Dame coach didn't have to do what he did last 
week, when Simmons became La Salle's all-time leading scorer in an 86-78 win 
over the Irish. When the announcement was made and no one from La Salle went to 
Simmons, Phelps grabbed the game ball, handed it to him and shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the media like him, too. Last Wednesday, Simmons could read about 
himself in USA Today and Sports Illustrated. Simmons is a 21-year-old criminal 
justice major who's 12 credits away from a college degree, and he enjoys 
recounting his Horatio Alger story to anyone with a notepad or mini-cam. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard to get the attention," Simmons said without a hint of 
braggadocio. "This is fun, and I'm enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding Simmons' rise out of the ghetto and into the 
spotlight obviously endear him to people. He overcame an environment that put 
two brothers in prison, and plenty of doubters, despite being one of the 
premier players in one of the nation's great basketball cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was ready for a Top 20-type team coming out of high school, but 
those coaches didn't think I was ready," Simmons said. "I was considering 
Temple, but they weren't sure I could play inside for them." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons can play for anyone in the country, but even La Salle Coach Tom 
"Speedy" Morris sounds as amazed as everyone else when it comes to discussing 
his impact. 
</P>
<P>
"No one thought Lionel would end up being this big," Morris said. "I coached 
against him when he was a sophomore in high school and you could see then the 
kid had talent and worked hard, but no one could envision what he's 
accomplished in four years here." 
</P>
<P>
The stars of Morris and Simmons were aligned in the spring of 1986, when 
Morris, who had powerhouses at Roman Catholic High in the 1970s, jumped from 
the La Salle women's program to the men's. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons watched the Big Five rivalries among La Salle, Penn, St. Joseph's, 
Temple and Villanova in the Palestra, and let it be known he was going to stay 
home to play his college basketball. A few weeks after Morris became the La 
Salle coach, Simmons signed with the Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at South Philadelphia High, Simmons and current teammate Bobby 
Johnson won a city public schools championship. The year before, they were 
beaten out for the title by Murrell Dobbins Tech, which had the Loyola 
Marymount combination of Bo Kimble and Hank Gathers and a sophomore point 
guard, Overton, who is now La Salle's second-best player. 
</P>
<P>
A Dobbins classmate of Overton's, Larry Stewart, is now Coppin State's best 
inside player. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons was proficient at all phases of the game but spectacular at none, and 
his main asset has always been a serious work ethic. If Simmons had a weakness 
when he came to La Salle, it was a lack of polish away from the basket. In his 
first two seasons, he was 4-for-14 from three-point range. This season, he's 
14-for-23, 60.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
"Very talented people tend to let their athletic ability take them as far as it 
will," Simmons said. "I don't think that's ever been the case with me. I've 
never been the type to just show up and think that everything is going to go 
well on its own." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons was the MAAC Rookie of the Year in 1986-87, when the Explorers lost in 
the first round of the conference tournament but went on to the final of the 
National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle since has lost one MAAC game and earned two NCAA tournament berths, 
and Simmons has improved to the level where last season he averaged 28.4 points 
and 11.4 rebounds, third and fifth in the nation, respectively. He's shooting 
over 49 percent for his career, and Morris said Simmons could easily average 40 
points if they weren't interested in the team. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has scored in double figures in 94 straight games, and Morris stressed 
that he will play just as hard against Loyola Monday as he did in a Dec. 2 date 
at DePaul. That was La Salle's first game ever on network television, and 
Simmons delivered 26 points and 14 rebounds in an 83-62 rout. 
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable thing about Lionel is that he does it against all opposition," 
Morris said. "He's the most consistent player I know. People have tried 
everything to stop him, and I haven't seen much work." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when he was in the third of his four seasons at Penn, Loyola 
Coach Tom Schneider worked a five-point victory over the Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a great job of holding him to 27 points," Schneider said. "We didn't do 
anything special on Lionel, we were just fortunate that we played well and they 
shot poorly. He gets the quietest points I've ever seen from anyone. Lionel 
doesn't excite the crowd or do anything fancy, but from a coach's standpoint, 
he's beautiful to watch."

BECKER SAYS HE WOULD TAKE DRUGS IF THEY GAVE OPPONENT AN EDGE

Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Boris Becker said he would take 
performance-enhancing drugs if other top tennis players did. 
</P>
<P>
The world's second-ranked player, competing in the Australian Open in 
Melbourne, said in an interview with the West German magazine Sports that, 
while tennis was clean, he understood why many athletes in other sports 
resorted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lendl kept beating me because he was taking steroids, I would take them 
too, I mean that," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would try to make sure we were competing on an equal basis. That's what it's 
all about. Otherwise I would just pack it all in straight away." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said drugs were not a problem in tennis because players need a variety 
of qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be doping perhaps if you could take something for your mental 
strength, something that made you think harder," Becker said. "When its 30-40 
and second service, it's about being mentally fitter than your opponent, not 
physically. There is no drug for that." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said at least 90% of the many track and field athletes he knew took 
drugs and he understood why. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in 1990 and every sport is all about money -- that is a fact," he told 
Sports. "Everyone knows that if you become Olympic champion once, then you are 
made financially. Your body and health come, if at all, in fourth place."

<P>
HOWELL, GRIFFIN GET INFLATION LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Dodgers took an unusual step in the battle against baseball inflation 
Friday by exercising contract options for the 1991 season on relief pitcher Jay 
Howell and shortstop Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
They also whittled their number of arbitration-eligible players to three by 
signing catcher Rick Dempsey to a one-year contract. Still eligible are Kal 
Daniels, Ray Searage and Franklin Stubbs, all of whom exchanged figures with 
the Dodgers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who made $325,000 last year, is seeking $700,000, and the Dodgers are 
offering $550,000. Stubbs, who made $345,000, is seeking $495,000 against 
$400,000. Searage, who made $140,000, is seeking $395,000 and being offered 
$300,000. If the players and club can't reach agreement before an upcoming 
hearing date, an arbitrator will decide between the player's figure and the 
club's figure. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers made certain there would be no financial indecision next year with 
Howell and Griffin. By exercising those options a year in advance, the Dodgers 
will be getting Howell for $1.05 million in 1991. They will be getting Griffin 
for $900,000. Both players signed these deals in the winter of 1988-89, before 
baseball's recent salary boom, which has left some agents questioning the 
Dodgers' good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Comte, Howell's agent, was being careful with his words. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't file a grievance -- it's a signed contract," Comte said. "But 
clearly some issues here are left to be discussed. We clearly know what is 
right. We clearly know what we want, and we have to handle that through 
appropriate means. This is a very fragile thing right now." 
</P>
<P>
Claire admitted that the early renewals were uncommon. He also admitted they 
were based on current economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we affected by current events?" Claire said. "Most certainly. We always 
have been, and always will be. As the game undergoes changes, we have to react 
to those changes. This is, perhaps, unusual. But this is also a reflection of 
the confidence we have in these players." 
</P>
<P>
Howell set a club record with 28 saves along with a 1.58 earned-run average in 
56 appearances in 1989. Griffin, bothered by both hand and shoulder problems, 
batted .247 but was once again spectacular in the field, finishing tied for 
third in fielding percentage among National League shortstops with just 14 
errors in 555 chances (.975). 
</P>
<P>
Citing frustration over his lack of choices, Tim Belcher said that walking out 
of spring training "is an option" if he and management don't reach agreement on 
a contract Belcher hopes will be worth close to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I will walk out. I'm only saying that when you don't have 
arbitration, you don't have leverage," he said. "So walking out of camp becomes 
your leverage." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher has just two full years of experience, thus does not qualify for 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement by early March, the Dodgers can simply fill in a 
salary figure that Belcher will have to accept. That happened last season, when 
he was renewed at $225,000, less than he had had in mind but still the highest 
salary for a second-year player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher is hoping to at least quadruple that figure. The Dodgers will probably 
offer closer to the $500,000. Belcher was 15-12 with a 2.82 earned run average 
in 1989. He had seven consecutive victories and was 5-0 in September with a 
1.51 ERA. He led the major leagues with eight shutouts, was tied for first in 
the National League with 10 complete games, and finished second in strikeouts 
with 200.

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
ALL-STARS WILL SHOW OFF SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you think you're an NBA fan. Quick, which side won the last league All-Star 
game, the East or the West? 
</P>
<P>
Or any NBA All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
How about the Pro Bowl for you football fans. Who won the last one, the NFC or 
the AFC? 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? Who cares? 
</P>
<P>
All-Star games, with the exception of baseball, are more about show time than 
winning time. You get a bunch of big names together, let them do their thing 
and don't get excited about the score. 
</P>
<P>
It was the NBA that first put that theory into practice. For years, the 
All-Star teams would get together the day before the game to "practice." 
There's not a lot of strategy to go over when you are sending Magic Johnson, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Julius Erving or any of the other big stars 
from the mid-'80s out on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
So the players tended to use the time to do what they love best, compare 
skills. Who could slam it best? Or score the most from outside? Who was the 
in-your-face ace? 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday practices started to turn into one big game of H-O-R-S-E. 
</P>
<P>
The word spread and soon the fans started showing up in large numbers for the 
real All-Star show. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA caught on and, starting in 1984, formalized the whole thing. There was 
a slam-dunk contest. And an old-timers game. A three-point shootout was added 
later. Television started showing it on Saturdays and All-Star Sunday turned 
into All-Star weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the NHL has taken the hint. With its All-Star game switched 
from a midweek affair to a Sunday, and the league on network television for the 
first time in a decade, it was decided to steal some ideas from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The result will be the first NHL skills contests, to be held today at the 
All-Star site, Pittsburgh's Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an old-timers affair, to be called the Heroes of Hockey game. As 
Shannon Shay of the NHL office put it, "What would you rather be, an old-timer 
or a hero?" 
</P>
<P>
Playing will be former stars Frank Mahovlich, Brad Park and Rod Gilbert, among 
others. Gordie Howe won't play, nor will Bobby Orr. 
</P>
<P>
The skills competition will pit the Campbell Conference against the Wales 
Conference in six events with each winning player receiving $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The events: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The puck control relay. Players must skate between pylons with the puck, 
then pass it on to the next member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hardest-shot competition. A speed gun will be used to determine whose 
shot is the fastest. This event was scheduled for last year's All-Star game, 
but had to be canceled when the speed gun wouldn't work. Presumably, they'll 
have extra batteries this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The accuracy contest. Players will shoot pucks at targets made of material 
designed to break apart upon impact. The players will be operating within a 
time frame, much as NBA players are required to do in their three-point 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rapid-fire relay. This involves three players a side shooting five 
pucks each at the net from various spots on the ice with a goalie defending. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speed skating. This is the only pure skating event. No sticks. No pucks. 
Just a chance to find out who skates the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The breakaway relay team event. A little like the rapid-fire competition 
except players try to score from the spot of their choice, getting six shots 
each at the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
The two opposing coaches, Terry Crisp of the Calgary Flames for the Campbell 
and Pat Burns of the Montreal Canadiens for the Wales, will select the 
competitors for each event, but all the players are required to take part in at 
least one. 
</P>
<P>
Each coach has some idea of how this grand scheme is actually going to work on 
ice. League officials recently used the Flames and Canadiens as guinea pigs to 
work out the inevitable bugs. 
</P>
<P>
The other teams have been sent videotapes to give those players involved some 
clue as to what is expected of them. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the today's competition are $15. Sunday game tickets are going for 
$40. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey being the dangerous sport it is, there are plenty of hazards that can 
keep a player out of action. 
</P>
<P>
But Pittsburgh Penguin defenseman Jim Kyte has added a new one -- reading. 
</P>
<P>
Reading? 
</P>
<P>
It happened on a recent trip to Edmonton. Usually the first player in the hotel 
lobby to await the team bus, Kyte grabbed a handful of newspapers for the ride 
to Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the bus in front of the hotel, got 
aboard, turned off his hearing aid -- Kyte is deaf -- and zeroed in on his 
reading material. 
</P>
<P>
When the bus stopped an hour later, Kyte got off and found himself at the West 
Edmonton Mall. 
</P>
<P>
He'd gotten on a city bus. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Good-News: Winger Brian Bellows has 31 goals already this season. He 
had 23 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Bad-News: The North Stars are stuck in fourth place in the Norris 
Division because they have been dreadful away from home. The club is 18-6-1 in 
the Met Center but 4-18-2 on the road.

CHANGES PLANNED FOR LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
RACE TRACK: ARNOLD WANTS REMODELED OR REBUILT FACILITY. COST MIGHT REACH $25 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, who headed a group that recently bought Los Alamitos for $71 
million, has outlined an ambitious plan that would include a new or remodeled 
racing facility, a refurbished golf course, office buildings and a hotel, all 
on the Cypress site. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold plans to formally announce his three-step plan later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest step is the remodeling or rebuilding of the racing facility. Arnold 
has already decided to tear down the turf club and clubhouse areas of the 
track. He then may rebuild the turf club above the grandstand area. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that he prefers a second option, an entirely new facility 
that would be built on the parking lot. Then, the current facility would be 
demolished and the new one would be moved onto the foundation where the current 
facility stands. 
</P>
<P>
The race track and parking lot are part of a 128-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The building of a new facility would cost $23 million-$25 million. If Arnold 
decides to simply reconstruct the grandstand and clubhouse, the cost will be 
half. A decision will be made in the fall, based on the success of racing this 
year. So far, the track is doing very well, with both attendance and handle up 
20-25%. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already made up our mind after running this thing a month that we are 
going to do one of the two," Arnold said. "If we come back here this fall and 
average a million dollars a night (betting handle) on harness and a million on 
the quarter horses, we're willing to take the risk. I have no doubt we'll 
obtain the million easy." 
</P>
<P>
After 40 days of the current harness racing meeting, the overall handle is 
almost $800,000 and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold has already sent the plans for the new facility out for estimates. He 
figures that racing would be interrupted for only four to six weeks and that 
construction would start within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Other plans for the racing strip include moving the paddock to the spectator 
side of the track and a new $2-million matrix board. Both should be in place 
before the end of the year and are not contingent on the other plans. 
</P>
<P>
A second step of the Los Alamitos plan is the refurbishing of the 93.5-acre 
golf course. The old clubhouse has already been destroyed and a new 
15,000-square foot building will be under construction soon. In addition, a 
double-deck driving range will be built. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the golf project is pegged at $2 million-$3 million and will be 
finished by mid-September. Arnold says he expects the golf course to average 
100,000-125,000 rounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
The third step is the development of 75 acres of frontage property on Katella 
Avenue and Walker Street. To do that, though, Arnold needs rezoning approval 
from the citizens of Cypress. He said a referendum will probably be added to 
the April 24 ballot and he expects it to pass, unlike a previous one. He says 
he has the support of Concerned Citizens of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"The one bid that got recalled included the redevelopment of the golf course," 
Arnold said. "That was more than the citizens of Cypress wanted. But we're only 
asking for one-fourth of the property to be rezoned, where the other group 
wanted two-thirds of the property." 
</P>
<P>
The property would house a business park and professional offices all along 
Katella, except where the golf course is, and along Walker between Katella and 
Cypress Avenue. A hotel and restaurants would be built on Katella near where 
the Vessels Stallion Farm used to be. Arnold said there has been interest shown 
by several major hotel chains but declined to name any. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he prefers to sell the property but that most of the decisions in 
the redevelopment will be handled by one of his partners, Buzz Oates. Oates is 
the biggest warehouse builder in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is the greatest spot in the world for a race track," Arnold 
said. "Orange County has everything. It has the population. It has the affluent 
population. It's a low crime area. It's clean and the weather is unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous need in Orange County for night entertainment and it's 
my dream to make this a place you can come at night." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold expects most racegoers to come from within a 15-20 mile radius of the 
track.

FIRST PICK NINE OF SEASON WORTH $259,201 TO WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single Pick Nine ticket purchased at a Santa Anita Inter-Track Wagering site 
on Friday had the winners of all nine races and was worth $259,201 to the fan 
holding it. The ticket had not been cashed at the close of the day. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the first 20 days of the winter-spring meeting that 
the Pick Nine has been won. The pool included a carryover of $240,755 from 
Thursday's program. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest longshot on the winning ticket came in the first race when No. 4, 
Rainbeau For Becky, paid $17 to win. In order, the other winning numbers, 
horses and win mutuels were: (3) Lager ($10.60), (5) Senegalaise ($8.20), (5) 
Vital Decision ($7.80), (5) Bit O'Dip ($7.80), (5) Perforce ($5.40), (4) For My 
Friends ($3.80), (4) Complicate ($9.20), (7) Greek Turf ($8.20).

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
CAN FIRST-TIMER LIVE UP TO LINEAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although most serious horseplayers rely on statistics, videotape analyses and 
the odds board in making their decisions, a good memory for thoroughbred 
ancestry sometimes comes in handy. Take Sunday's Santa Anita card, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Live the Dream, one of the favorites in the featured San Marcos Handicap, and 
War Craft, a 3-year-old making his debut in the sixth race, are both sons of 
the T.V. Lark mare Became a Lark. Live the Dream, whose sire is Northern Baby, 
and War Craft, by Ack Ack, are among six sons and daughters of Became a Lark to 
race in California for trainer Charlie Whittingham and his partners, Mary 
Bradley and Nancy Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
So now comes the tough part. Will the unraced War Craft take after Live the 
Dream, a slow starter who did not win his first race until May of 1989, well 
into his 3-year-old season? By the end of the year, however, Live the Dream had 
won two stakes, including the Hollywood Derby, and $257,900. 
</P>
<P>
War Craft could just as easily follow in the footsteps of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bang Bang Bang, also by Ack Ack, now 10 years old and still earning his 
keep with trainer Richard Lockwood at Turf Paradise in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Became a Cat, an 8-year-old who is now a stable pony for Whittingham after 
a zero-for-seven racing career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Or Proud Cat, a stakes-placed 6-year-old who was claimed when Whittingham 
took him to New York last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie says he looks just like Ack Ack, and that's enough to get excited 
about right there," Bradley said Friday. "But there are so many ifs in this 
business. An owner is not really allowed to get excited at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bradley who got the clan rolling in 1975 when she bought Became a Lark 
and her dam, the French mare Blow Up II, for $25,000. After selling one-third 
interests to Whittingham and Chandler, she has gotten more than her money's 
worth out of the family. 
</P>
<P>
But if War Craft lives up to his early promise, he could upstage even Live the 
Dream. Since last summer, when the bay colt was training at San Luis Rey Downs, 
War Craft has done nothing to disappoint Whittingham or his staff. Chris 
McCarron will be riding him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I got on him he worked five-eighths in :57," McCarron said. 
"He's a sensible colt with a lot of class. If he is as competitive in the 
afternoon as he is in the mornings, we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, a master of the understatement, said that War Craft could turn out 
to be a good horse. Others who have earned that description recently include 
champions Ferdinand, Estrapade and Sunday Silence, who has replaced 1971 horse 
of the year Ack Ack as "the best horse I've ever trained," according to 
Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham was roasted and toasted at a benefit dinner last Sunday night at a 
downtown hotel. Among those getting the last laugh on the 76-year-old trainer 
was Bradley, who has been Whittingham's patron for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Woody Stephens said I should get an Eclipse Award just for lasting that long 
with Charlie," said Bradley, whose red colors have been carried by such 
Whittingham stars as Cougar II, Greinton, Castilla and Swingtime. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had the audience roaring with her tongue-in-cheek "owner's guide," a 
seven-point checklist guaranteed to rub an old-fashioned trainer like 
Whittingham in the worst possible way. The highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always consult with the groom and then the veterinarian before asking the 
trainer about your horse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Read the condition book carefully and let your trainer know what races 
conflict with your social schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Select your own yearlings, rather than bothering the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Call your trainer each evening at 10 p.m., wish him a good night and hang 
up immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary forgot one," Whittingham added a few days later. "'The only thing more 
dangerous than a mugger with a knife is an owner with a condition book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had owners come up to me after buying a yearling and say, 'Now, just take 
as much time as you need with this horse. When do we run?' " 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, one of Whittingham's biggest owners has become . . . 
Charlie Whittingham. Each month, Whittingham the owner runs up a bill with 
Whittingham the trainer that reaches well into five figures. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual for a well established trainer to double as an owner -- Wayne 
Lukas, Laz Barrera and Jerry Fanning often show up on both sides of the 
program. But it does have its downside. 
</P>
<P>
"It can get awful expensive if you're not lucky," Whittingham said. 
"Fortunately, I've had a little luck." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Live the Dream's opposition in the 10-furlong San Marcos includes stablemate 
River Warden, San Gabriel Handicap winner Wretham, Citation Handicap winner 
Fair Judgment and Allen Paulson's Samoan. Racing secretary Tom Robbins said the 
full width of the turf course would be used to accommodate the 14-horse field, 
and that the race would stay on the grass barring anything but the most 
unexpected downpour. . . . Today's seven-furlong Santa Monica Handicap for 
fillies and mares rematches Stormy but Valid and Survive, the 1-2 finishers in 
the Las Flores Handicap Jan. 6, plus Hidden Garden, Solid Eight, Hot Novel, 
Stocks Up and Baba Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Cheval Volant, winner of the Hollywood Starlet Stakes, heads the field in 
today's Bay Meadows Oaks in San Mateo. Santa Anita will offer betting on the 
3-year-old filly race at the end of the live nine-race program. . . . Sandy 
Hawley got a rude welcome back Friday when his two mounts beat exactly one 
horse. The popular Canadian star will ride Chilean stakes winner Wizard in the 
San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham ended Friday's program zero for 29 at the Santa Anita 
meeting so far, while trainer Steve Young continued his hot streak by winning 
the seventh race with For My Friends. Young is now six for 10.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 KILLED IN PLANE CRASH AFTER TAKEOFF 
IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men killed in a fiery plane crash shortly after taking off from Burbank 
Airport were identified as a flight instructor and three other pilots who were 
on a training flight, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The four victims were flying to Santa Barbara when the plane crashed at 8:15 
p.m. Thursday, said Gary Mucho, regional director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
Although the men have been tentatively identified, their names were not 
released Friday pending confirmation through dental records by the medical 
examiner's office. At least three of the pilots were believed to be members of 
the Burbank-based Pilots Co-op flying club, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 125 POUNDS OF FRUIT A DAY CONFISCATED AT 
AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agriculture inspectors stationed since last week at Burbank Airport 
have been confiscating an average of 125 pounds of fruit per day in the effort 
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly outbreak from spreading beyond Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than I expected," said Scott Sanner, one of six U.S. Department of 
Agriculture plant protection and quarantine officers assigned to the airport 
since Tuesday. "I know the airlines are surprised." 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed officers are stationed at the airport's two security checkpoints 
and monitor X-ray screens for fruit. Fruit found in carry-on luggage is taken 
to the department's El Monte office for inspection.

<P>
Friends of a Venice High School student killed in a drive-by shooting across 
the street from the school organized a fund-raising carwash in his memory as 
police arrested a gang member in connection with the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Correa Mayorga, 18, is being held in jail after his arrest on suspicion 
of murder late Thursday night, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Oscar Hinojosa, whom police describe as a rival gang member, and a

COMPLEX OPENS DOORS TO ELDERLY KOREANS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: SANGNOK VILLA IS LOS ANGELES' FIRST SUBSIDIZED APARTMENT HOUSE FOR THE 
AREA'S GROWING KOREAN COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 120 Korean-American senior citizens joined Los Angeles housing 
development officials Friday to celebrate the completion of Sangnok Villa, the 
city's first subsidized housing project for the region's burgeoning Korean 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Between benedictions by a Korean minister and the singing of the U.S. and 
Korean national anthems, developers and supporters of the new 60-unit apartment 
house for low-income, elderly tenants marked the official opening of Sangnok, 
which means "evergreen" in Korean. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of the three-story, peach-colored complex at 732 S. Bonnie Brae St. 
said they have received about 600 applications for the 60 apartment units. 
Tenants will be chosen based on their income level, the cost of their current 
housing and the order in which their applications were received, building 
supervisor Lois Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
One applicant, Kyung Woon Choi, 82, said that although he has lived in the 
Crenshaw area for 29 years and would have to pay more rent if he moves into 
Sangnok, he wants to live in the new project because he likes the house rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The managers are looking closely at the people who have applied," he said in 
Korean. "The ones who get to move in won't be the kind who smoke and drink too 
much. I'd really like that," he said, pointing to a "no smoking" sign in the 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the prospective tenants are Korean, Choi said he appreciated 
the apartment complex policy of taking all applications regardless of race. "I 
like living in a place that has an open door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-bedroom units measure 580 square feet and are designed for the 
handicapped and elderly. They have an emergency signaling system and grab rails 
on bathroom walls and the shower. The complex also has wheelchair access. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the building, Sangnok organizers received $3.9 million from the 
city's Community Redevelopment Agency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and the Retirement Housing Foundation, a national nonprofit private 
developer specializing in housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants, who are required to be 62 or older, will be able to move in by the end 
of January, Reed said. Rents will range from $291 to $394, about 30% to 40% 
below the cost for new apartments in the area, developers said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 Korean senior citizens live in Los Angeles County, said Dr. 
Eung Soo Han, director of a Pacific Palisades medical consultant group and a 
board member of the senior citizen organization, the Christian Evergreen Assn. 
About 10% of those elderly residents are in dire need of affordable housing, 
Han said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's just 60 rooms," Han said of the development, "it's a start." 
</P>
<P>
During planning of the project, Han said, organizers learned how to get around 
language limitations and difficulties in understanding how mainstream funding 
sources operate. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things that many people have to get through," he said. "The success 
Koreans have had with the project shows us that there is a way."

IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL FOR EXILED TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Stapleton's troubles arrived a year and a half ago in an envelope with no 
return address. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, they will end when she goes back to work as a journalism teacher 
and adviser to the campus newspaper at East Los Angeles College after winning a 
prolonged battle with the school. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, Stapleton had almost completed her 15th year as faculty adviser 
to Campus News, the student newspaper at ELAC. The award-winning paper 
regularly incensed school administrators for its critical -- some said biased 
-- coverage of campus issues. 
</P>
<P>
The envelope that initiated Stapleton's ordeal contained a photocopy of the 
academic transcript of ELAC's student body president. It showed she was 
enrolled in three units instead of the nine-unit minimum required by those in 
student government. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, the paper published a story with the headline "Lisa Quesada 
taking insufficient units to hold ASO president post" next to a photograph of 
the alleged transcript. It included Quesada's explanation that she had been 
late in adding two classes that didn't show up on the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
That story -- which the newspaper later retracted -- would prove Stapleton's 
undoing. 
</P>
<P>
A livid Quesada and school administrators maintained that the article was 
incorrect. More seriously, they said in a formal disciplinary action that the 
school paper violated federal, state and college district privacy rules by 
printing the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
For administrators, it was only the latest in a long string of stories that had 
stirred up trouble. Last May, saying it was "for the good of the school," the 
Los Angeles Community College District transferred Stapleton to Pierce College 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer reduced Stapleton from head of ELAC's journalism department to an 
instructor with five classes. Her commute more than doubled. She was separated 
from longtime friends and colleagues because, Stapleton said, she exercised a 
principle she had been teaching for many years: freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton fought back, and in late fall, an arbitrator ruled that the district 
had no right to transfer her. It ordered her reinstatement effective Feb. 5, 
when the spring semester begins. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton will return to a different ELAC. Many former administrators have 
retired or been transferred, bringing once-bitter faculty infighting to an end. 
Those who remain speak highly of the new president, Omero Suarez. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole new attitude on this campus now," said Raul Cardoza, ELAC's 
vice president of academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stapleton was vindicated, the case raises important questions about 
freedom of the press and censorship. The debate is especially acute for 
school-financed campus papers, where students often use investigative reporting 
skills learned in class to turn a critical eye on administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
At Stapleton's hearing, the teachers' union argued that upholding the transfer 
would create "a serious chilling effect on freedom of the press at ELAC and on 
academic freedom of all advisers in the district." The district argued that 
Stapleton was at the center of controversy on campus and that her transfer 
would alleviate "substantial instability and strife." 
</P>
<P>
In the last six years, Campus News has come under criticism for stories about: 
</P>
<P>
* Problems in the administration of former ELAC President Arthur Avila, who 
received a faculty vote of no confidence for what was called poor morale and 
lack of leadership. Avila resigned in August, 1988, under pressure, according 
to the Los Angeles Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
* The arrest of Hal Mintz, chairman of ELAC's business department, for running 
a house of prostitution and income tax evasion. Mintz eventually resigned from 
ELAC and pleaded no contest to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Avila writing a letter of praise about Mintz to the West Hollywood Business 
License Commission, which later revoked the license of Mintz's massage parlor. 
</P>
<P>
* A $250 phone bill for ELAC's Associated Student Organization that included 
charges for calls to Acapulco, Mexico, El Salvador and at least a dozen 
976-prefix numbers. 
</P>
<P>
* Three ELAC professors who held doctorates from colleges that were 
unaccredited at the time their degrees were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Some faculty members have applauded the paper's coverage. "There's a lot of 
dirty politics going on at our school," said Daniel Fertig, a life science 
instructor. "She was doing a good job, but she printed too many hot stories 
about the administration," he said, referring to Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
But school administrators say Stapleton should have seen to it that the 
students printed more balanced stories. They say she violated one of the basic 
tenets of journalism by printing several critical stories without giving 
administrators a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Jean Stapleton created too much conflict on the campus . . . and 
that it was in the best interests of the students and faculty to make the 
change," Jose Robledo, acting vice chancellor of human resources for Los 
Angeles Community College District, said of the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton noted that the Campus News won several state investigative reporting 
awards last year from the state Journalism Assn. of Community Colleges. Her own 
experience included covering portions of the Charles Manson trials for City 
News Service. She has been president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National 
Assn. for Women, and has written three books, one on women in management. 
</P>
<P>
The administration "thought the newspaper should be a PR piece that said how 
well the football team was doing and when the band was going to play," 
Stapleton said. "I was teaching them to be reporters, and that's not always 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the paper's feisty coverage, Stapleton said, the administration cut 
its annual budget from $30,000 to $5,000. In October, 1988, a faculty member 
upset about a story was authorized by Avila to search the newspaper offices 
escorted by campus police, Stapleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton maintains that Quesada gave up privacy about her qualifications when 
she became a school leader and that U.S. Supreme Court decisions that give 
newspapers broad freedom to write about elected officials also apply to campus 
papers. She likened the Quesada story to stories exposing star college athletes 
who fail to carry full academic loads. 
</P>
<P>
But her arguments didn't sway the administration. In addition to transferring 
her, it placed the student editor who wrote the Quesada story on probation for 
a year. A staff photographer was placed on probation for a semester. 
</P>
<P>
Some faculty members accused Stapleton of fomenting dissent and using the paper 
for her own ends. "The campus newspaper should be an instrument of education 
and not a political weapon as it was in the past," says Ray Ceniceroz, head of 
the ELAC Chicano Studies Department. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton's students are pleased she is coming back. "Her return will help 
bolster the department," says Mike Ortiz, editor of Campus News. "She's very 
supportive; she motivates students."

DEATH OF A SURVIVALIST: ONLY LAPSE PROVED TO BE HIS LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Obney was a survivalist, a trainer of attack dogs and a man so 
concerned with security that he carried a bullet-proof vest with him whenever 
he traveled from his isolated desert home. 
</P>
<P>
The one time he let his guard down, someone dressed in a Santa Claus suit 
pointed a gift-wrapped box at him in front of a coffee shop and pumped five 
shots from a semiautomatic rifle into his chest. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, friends of Obney, who was 36 when he was slain Dec. 21 in 
Bakersfield, will hold a benefit for his family at a San Gabriel Valley 
restaurant and bar, not far from where he grew up in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering, from 2 to 8 p.m. at Mr. Mike's in Covina, will feature 
entertainment from several musicians who shared mutual friends with Obney, 
including David Hidalgo, guitarist and singer for Los Lobos. The $5 admission 
will go to Obney's widow, Mona, and their two teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will be somewhat of a happy occasion," said Patrick Savant, a 
longtime friend who helped organize the event. "I don't want it to be 
depressing. I just wanted to do something to help the family." 
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the Christmastime attack do not believe it was a random 
shooting. But they have no suspects and little to go on, apart from witnesses 
saying the assailant was tall, wearing a Santa suit and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have heard how many reports of people with Santa suits we got that 
day," said Bakersfield Police Sgt. Brad Singleton, head of the homicide 
division. "Something like 14 million. Santa was seen all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
When Obney left the San Gabriel Valley in 1975, it was to escape the lunacy of 
city life. A former auto repossession man for a collection agency, he found 
peace on 15 acres of desert land in Joshua Tree, where he wore his hair 
shoulder-length, his beard bushy and built up a cache of weapons and canned 
food to be used in the event of a natural disaster or emergency. 
</P>
<P>
He also purchased his first German shepherd, one of hundreds that he would 
eventually breed and train at his own kennel, Obney Shepherds Inc. Most of the 
dogs were sold for protection to businesses and celebrities throughout the 
country. But some of his clients, friends said, were unsavory characters. 
</P>
<P>
"In selling these dogs, he realized how much bad stuff and how many bad people 
were out there," said his sister, Barbara Flotow. "That made him angry. The 
main thing in his life was helping people protect themselves from that bad 
element." 
</P>
<P>
Four days before Christmas, Obney and a partner drove to Bakersfield with two 
German shepherd pups that they had arranged to sell to someone at a Denny's 
Restaurant. Obney left the dogs, his bullet-proof vest and .38-caliber revolver 
on the floor of his Chevy Blazer. Then they went into the restaurant and 
waited. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 4 p.m., a man telephoned Denny's and told Obney to keep waiting. 
About 45 minutes later, he called again and said he was having car problems. He 
gave Obney directions where to find him. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just didn't seem right," said Obney's partner, who was wounded in the 
arm during the attack and asked that his name not be used. "I can't tell you 
what it was. It was just like a gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
As they walked out of the restaurant at about 5:15 p.m., a man in a Santa 
outfit and false beard approached them, carrying a gold gift-wrapped box, tied 
with a red ribbon, under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
The weapon never left the box. The shots ripped out of the cardboard about 12 
feet from Obney. The gunman disappeared into the thick fog that enveloped the 
San Joaquin Valley community that night. Obney died shortly after arriving at 
Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral, the casket was open and someone placed a tiny cloth German 
shepherd on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"He believed everyone needed complete and total security," said Dave Messer, 
who met Obney in seventh grade. "Sometimes I think he went a little overboard. 
But it wasn't paranoia. It was awareness. He knew you could get blown away for 
no reason at all."

JURY GETS 'VICTORVILLE 5' BRUTALITY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling it a case about "truth, justice, freedom and the American way of life," 
a lawyer for five Mexican men allegedly beaten by Victorville sheriff's 
deputies in 1988 asked jurors Friday to award them $6.7 million to "send a 
message" that "we don't tolerate this kind of conduct here in the United 
States, ever." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Yagman told jurors all they had to do was "look at the videotape" that 
recorded the incident to see that the five San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department deputies brutally beat the men and unlawfully arrested them in a 
Victorville front yard on June 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jury deliberations began late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments of the three-week civil trial in Los Angeles Federal 
Court, Yagman said of contradictory accounts from deputies: "God only knows 
what these officers would have said happened if this videotape didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
But David A. Lawrence, attorney for the deputies, cautioned jurors that the 
four-minute videotape of the confrontation offers only one, limited perspective 
on the incident. Too conveniently, he added, it begins after one of the men 
shoved a deputy and tried to grab the guns of two of the officers. Lawrence 
asserted that jurors were being shown only part of what he believes was once a 
longer videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the so-called "Victorville Five" is one of the first in which a 
videotape has been used as evidence in a police brutality case in Federal 
Court. Latino activists from San Bernardino County say the film also has 
provided the first substantive evidence of what they allege has been a pattern 
of racially motivated acts of brutality by deputies against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape, made by a neighbor, "captures in living color the acts of police 
brutality we have said all along take place in our community," Armando Navarro, 
executive director of a San Bernardino-based civil rights organization, said at 
a news conference on the courthouse steps Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between law enforcement and minorities have improved dramatically 
since the 1988 incident, which began with a complaint about a loud, drunken 
party, Navarro said. But it took this case and "the videotape of the violence 
to begin a process of perestroika within the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the civil rights suit are Sheriff Floyd Tidwell and the County of 
San Bernardino. U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima has ruled that claims 
against Tidwell and the county would be tried separately by the same jury, but 
only if jurors decide that the constitutional rights of one or more of the 
plaintiffs were violated. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs -- Jose Serrano; his father, Efren Serrano; his brother, Victor 
Serrano, and friends Auro Ruiz and Javier Ruelas -- claim that they suffered 
serious bruises and injuries that went untreated. The lawyer for the deputies 
has argued that the injuries amount to bruises and scratches, none of which 
required hospitalization or immediate medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman asked jurors Friday to award the plaintiffs $5,700 to cover medical 
bills, a total of $1.7 million to compensate them for their pain and suffering, 
and another $5 million in punitive damages as a message to the San Bernardino 
County Sheriff's Department, and law enforcement agencies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing arguments, Lawrence summarized contradictions in the testimony 
of the five men about the alleged beatings. He said deputies did use batons, 
fists, elbows and a chokehold to subdue the five men. But that force, he said, 
was needed to control combative men who had been drinking beer for more than 12 
hours in their front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy (for jurors) to look at that videotape . . . because there is 
no risk involved," Lawrence told them. "It's very different if you are a deputy 
(looking at the same situation)."

MERCURY S&amp;L ORDERED TO HALT LENDING, INVESTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH INSTITUTION HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH LOSSES. IT'S 
THE FOURTH MAJOR S&amp;L IN CALIFORNIA TO BE HIT WITH STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS 
THIS YEAR.

Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, struggling for a year to curb losses, said it was 
ordered Friday by federal regulators in San Francisco to halt all lending and 
investment activities. 
</P>
<P>
The order does not affect the S&amp;L's routine customer deposits nor its 
$3-billion loan-servicing portfolio. The S&amp;L also can fill pending 
commitments for loans and investments, but no new loans or investments can be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Shane, chairman of the Huntington Beach-based S&amp;L, said Friday in 
an interview that he will seek a meeting with regulators as soon as possible to 
try to ease the restrictions so that Mercury can make single-family home loans 
of up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is the fourth major S&amp;L in the state this year to be placed under 
such severe operating restrictions. The others are Valley Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan in Van Nuys, Imperial Savings Assn. in San Diego and Santa Barbara Savings 
&amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which lost $5.4 million in the first nine months last year, has nearly 
run out of tangible capital, which is essentially the amount of cash it has as 
a final reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
It said it doesn't meet any of the three strict capital tests imposed under a 
federal law enacted in August to bail out the thrift industry's deposit 
insurance fund. Its tangible capital is negligible, only 0.04% of assets at the 
end of September -- well below the required 1.5% level. Its core capital, 
another test, was 1.54%, nearly half the required 3% level. No information is 
available on the third test, which weighs the risk of the S&amp;L's loans and 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, who formerly headed the thrift industry's chief California and national 
trade groups, said his institution sent regulators a business plan and a plan 
for raising capital, but regulators have not yet responded to his proposals. 
Mercury essentially is reducing assets and trying to sell five Northern 
California branches in an effort to obtain cash. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts and consultants are already writing the S&amp;L's obituary, 
saying it is essentially insolvent and can be rescued only through a sale. 
Mercury has hired investment bankers to search for a possible suitor or 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisory order is "tantamount to failure," said Bert Ely, an industry 
consultant in Alexandria, Va. He said the order could be viewed as the 
regulators' answer to Shane's business and capital plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Most institutions cannot survive very long under this type of order," said Don 
Murray, a thrift accounting partner at the Irvine office of Deloitte &amp; 
Touche, a national accounting firm. In similar situations, such letters simply 
put institutions in a holding pattern until regulators decide what to do with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury has 24 branches and 800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
If Mercury simply plans to sell assets to increase its capital, the 
restrictions may not hurt it badly, Murray said. But if the S&amp;L had planned 
to invest proceeds from asset sales to earn capital, then the restrictions pose 
serious problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L, which had $2.25 billion in assets at the end of September, ran 
into serious problems with commercial and construction loans in the mid 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate it obtained through foreclosures or bankruptcies left Mercury with 
a large number of properties that produced no income. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, its repossessed properties amounted to nearly $14 
million, or 11.1% of its assets. Well-managed S&amp;Ls typically keep that 
figure below 1%, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, accountants' estimates of future earnings from servicing loans and 
of future tax liabilities were inaccurate a year ago. Mercury had to restate 
its 1988 profit and post a $13.8-million loss for that year. Those accounting 
procedures continued to plague the S&amp;L last year. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mercury hasn't invested in high-yield junk bonds or other risky 
investments that placed other S&amp;Ls in jeopardy, its accounting assumptions 
on future income constituted a risky venture, Ely said.

ROMANIAN TRIP ENDS IN RELIEF AND SADNESS;

REVOLUTION: A FULLERTON MAN WHO BURIED HIS BROTHER AFTER A MISSION OF MERCY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Constantine Antimie knew the moment he crossed into his native Romania late 
last month that things were different: the border agent, without the customary 
frisking or luggage search, greeted him and his brother with a friendly 
"Welcome to Romania!" 
</P>
<P>
The moment proved a false harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, the two Antimie brothers from Fullerton were attacked three times 
by armed assailants in the revolution-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
The third time proved deadly. Constantine's brother, 21-year-old John, was shot 
eight times, killed in a hail of gunfire from about a dozen state security 
police who were apparently suspicious of any foreign cars, the brother said. 
</P>
<P>
The secret police, still struggling at the time to hold onto the country days 
after the fall of their leader, dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu, fired without 
warning from a field as the West German rental car sped past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Constantine himself eventually escaped the attack with only slight wounds. And 
after burying his brother, he returned late Thursday night to the United States 
to some 40 tearful family members and friends. With him, he brought a 
bullet-riddled jacket, graphic photos and details of his brother's death, and 
tales of a determined nation in the throes of change. 
</P>
<P>
It was to have been an uplifting return to Romania -- to see old friends, 
including John's 16-year-old fiancee; to take their sister back to America, 
and, foremost, to bring $19,000 to their hometown to help build a church and 
bribe Communist leaders not to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
The church money was part of the tithe that both brothers had set aside each 
month, earned through a family contracting business that they started after 
coming to the United States in 1985 with their father and most of their 10 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there was a sense of some triumph among the throng who greeted 
Constantine at Los Angeles International Airport -- triumph over the fall of 
Ceaucescu and triumph over Constantine's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God that I am again in America," he said moments after hugging his 
three young children and wife for the first time in a month. "I was too close 
to death . . . to think that I would be able to see my family again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle to be alive today." 
</P>
<P>
Once reunited with his family, Constantine could think only of his brother as 
he shared the horrifying photographs that he took at the death scene. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures show his brother's bloodied, bullet-punctured body laying limp in 
the passenger seat of their rented Audi, as well as uniformed men milling 
about. The car was hit some 500 times in all, Constantine said. Small pools of 
blood surrounded it. 
</P>
<P>
As he sat in his Fullerton home, Constantine leafed through the pictures in 
seeming disbelief and filled in details from his own recollection. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers had left for Romania last month to aid in the building of the 
church in their hometown of Marginea, armed with the $19,000 in cash. They had 
made their plans secretly after hearing from friends in Romania that the 
Communist government had torn down the church in their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, the townspeople were rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
But the brothers' plans were sidetracked by the revolution in Romania. They 
heard about the fall of Ceaucescu and the outbreak of violence while in France 
waiting to go to Romania and, changing their plans, used much of the money to 
buy food and medical supplies to bring with them, Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
And so they crossed into Romania from Yugoslavia, supplies in tow. Warned about 
armed Ceaucescu forces who were still terrorizing the country, they picked a 
southern route to Marginea that they thought would be safe. They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble came quickly. Near the town of Resita, the brothers spotted in the 
woods along the roadside two armed civilians whom they thought to be hijackers. 
Eight to ten shots were fired, Constantine said, but the brothers escaped 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The second attack came near the town of Hateg when armed bandits apparently not 
connected to Ceaucescu robbed them of some of their medical supplies. But again 
they escaped unharmed with the aid of local townspeople; upon hearing the 
brothers were fellow Christians, the townspeople escorted them in safety for 
about 12 miles toward their destination. 
</P>
<P>
Back on their own, the men had to stop to get directions because the road signs 
had been taken down. John warned Constantine at the time to be careful because 
they were entering a dangerous area. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a few hundred miles from their destination of Marginea along the 
back roads, the shots came -- without warning, from nowhere, it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
From the nearby fields came hundreds of rounds of gunfire, piercing the 
passenger's side of the car and windshield, Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
He heard his brother breathing heavily as he stopped the car. He looked, and 
John was dead. Constantine opened his door and rolled out into the fields, away 
from the uniformed attackers who were running toward the car. He hid for a 
while beside a tree, but they spotted him. 
</P>
<P>
The men searched the car, tossing luggage and contents about the road and using 
a bayonet to open a briefcase. Under gunpoint, Constantine pleaded with them 
not to kill him: "I have three children!" he recalled saying. 
</P>
<P>
But it was only with the intervention of a civilian passer-by, Constantine 
believes, that he survived. The stranger, pointing to Constantine's knowledge 
of the language, told the assailants that he was not a foreigner and urged his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Constantine said the men then left the scene, taking John's body with them. At 
the local mortuary, Constantine later retrieved the body of his brother -- 
identified by workers there as a "terrorist" -- and brought it back to Marginea 
for burial before about 3,000 townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
Work continued on the church as planned. Constantine said he spent $6,000 or so 
from what was left of his money on 25,000 square feet of hardwood floors for 
the church and wall linings. There was no need for the bribes because Ceaucescu 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was changed," he said. "Now, the religion is the most important 
thing. Now, it is a country under God." 
</P>
<P>
The work on the church was mostly done by the time he left Romania earlier this 
week, Constantine said. But it did not seem the same without John working at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so shocking, so difficult -- I cannot find the words in English," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the United States, there was no funeral, no body. But several hundred 
family members and friends made do with a memorial service, remembering the 
slain man as a hero. And family members on Friday were given fresh images of 
John in photographs -- both the smiling young man who waited to enter Romania a 
few weeks ago, and the bloodied body slumped in the car, a casualty of the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Still, said the victim's father, Ion, "It doesn't seem real."

<P>
After years of dispute over development of Los Alamitos Race Track, city 
officials say they are poised to endorse an ambitious plan by Lloyd Arnold -- 
head of a group that recently bought the property for $71 million -- to build a 
new or remodeled racing facility, a refurbished golf course, office buildings 
and a hotel on the 128-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Councilman John Kanel reacted with enthusiasm Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This new plan is definitely a big plus for the citizens of Cypress," Kanel 
said. "I will urge all citizens to support the proposal so we can move forward 
and solve some of the problems that have divided the community." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the plan would require a change in zoning for 75 acres of the land, 
however. So the City Council is expected Monday to consider seeking voter 
approval in an April 24 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's plan also has the acceptance of a powerful residents group. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, it's looking very good to us," said Joyce Nicholson, president of 
Concerned Citizens of Cypress for Greenbelt and Open Space Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is the greatest spot in the world for a race track," Arnold 
said. "Orange County has everything. It has the population. It has the affluent 
population. It's a low-crime area. It's clean and the weather is unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous need in Orange County for night entertainment, and it's 
my dream to make this a place you can come at night." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest step is the remodeling or rebuilding of the racing facility. Arnold 
has already decided to tear down the turf club and clubhouse at the track. He 
then may rebuild the turf club above the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said, however, that he prefers a second option -- an entirely new 
facility that would be built on the parking lot. Then, the current facility 
would be demolished and the new one moved onto the foundation where the current 
facility stands. 
</P>
<P>
The building of a new facility would cost $23 million and $25 million. Simply 
rebuilding the grandstand and clubhouse would cost about half as much. A 
decision will be made in the fall, based on the success of racing this year. So 
far, the track is doing very well, with both attendance and betting up 20% to 
25%. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already made up our mind after running this thing a month that we are 
going to do one of the two," Arnold said. "If we come back here this fall and 
average a million dollars a night (betting handle) on harness and a million on 
the quarter horses, we're willing to take the risk. I have no doubt we'll 
obtain the million easy." 
</P>
<P>
After 40 days of the current harness racing meeting, the overall handle is 
almost $800,000 and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold has already sent the plans for the new facility out for estimates. He 
figures that racing would be interrupted for just four to six weeks and that 
construction would start within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Other plans include moving the paddock to the spectator side of the track and 
building a new, $2-million matrix board. Both should be in place before the end 
of the year and are not contingent on the other plans. 
</P>
<P>
A second step of the Los Alamitos plan is the refurbishing of its 93.5-acre 
golf course. The old clubhouse has already been razed and a new, 
15,000-square-foot building will be under construction soon. In addition, a 
double-deck driving range will be built. 
</P>
<P>
The golf project is expected to cost $2 million to $3 million; construction is 
expected to be finished by mid-September. Arnold said he expects the golf 
course to average 100,000 to 125,000 rounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
The third step is the development of 75 acres of frontage property on Katella 
Avenue and Walker Street. To do that, though, Arnold needs rezoning approval 
from the citizens of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The last proposed development for the Los Alamitos track and golf course 
property was defeated by voters nearly 3 to 1 in 1989. But that proposal, 
dubbed "Cypress Downs," called for a much more densely developed commercial 
complex and was opposed by Concerned Concerned Citizens of Cypress for 
Greenbelt and Open Space Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks much much better," group leader Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said as a condition imposed by the council to place the current 
project on the ballot, her group has agreed to drop its appeal of a lawsuit 
brought by the developers of the earlier Cypress Downs proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, the concerned citizens' group was instrumental in approving 
ballot Measure D, which requires a referendum when rezoning land, such as the 
Los Alamitos property, that has been designated only for public and semipublic 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises, the prior owner of the property, sued to 
overturn Measure D and won. But the citizens group appealed the ruling, in 
effect keeping Measure D in force. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said under the agreement recently reached with the current 
developers, the citizens group will not pursue its appeal, and the developers 
will not require Measure D to be scrapped. This will retain protection for 
other areas in the city zoned for public uses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The one bid that got recalled included the redevelopment of the golf course," 
Arnold said. "That was more than the citizens of Cypress wanted. But we're only 
asking for one-fourth of the property to be rezoned, where the other group 
wanted two-thirds of the property." 
</P>
<P>
Under Arnold's plan, the property would house a business park and professional 
offices all along Katella, except where the golf course is, and along Walker 
between Katella and Cypress Avenue. A hotel and restaurants would be built on 
Katella near the former Vessels Stallion Farm. Arnold said there has been 
interest shown by several major hotel chains but declined to name any. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said that he would prefer to sell the property but that most of the 
decisions in the redevelopment will be handled by one of his partners, Buzz 
Oates. Oates is the biggest warehouse builder in Northern California.

ALEUT TRIBE GIVEN ADOPTION CONTROL OF BABY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE RELUCTANTLY RULES THAT INDIAN NATION HAS LEGAL RIGHTS TO A 
CYPRESS WOMAN'S BABY. A MISSISSIPPI CASE LAST YEAR SET A PRECEDENT, HE SAID.

<P>
Saying he is deeply disturbed that American Indians have the right to "reach 
into a woman's womb" in child-custody cases, a judge reluctantly ruled Friday 
that federal law entitles the Aleut tribe to claim a part-Aleut baby whose 
mother has put the child up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis said that under the 1978 
Indian Child Welfare Act, the Alaskan tribe has the power to deem 7-month-old 
Rebecca Argleben a member of the tribe and to override her mother's wishes that 
she be reared by a non-Indian family. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Aleuts had argued that federal law treats Indian tribes as 
sovereign nations, entitled to define their own membership, preserve their 
culture and stem the breakup of their families. That right, they argued, is 
more important than a mother's desire to govern the adoption of her baby. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca's unmarried mother, 18-year-old Jodi Argleben of Cypress, contends that 
she should not be controlled by the tribe's wishes because she no longer has 
any connection with Indian culture. 
</P>
<P>
Polis said he sympathized with the plight of Indians and is obligated to uphold 
the law that Congress designed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he believes the law violates the due-process rights of the baby's 
mother because it gives the tribe the unilateral power to claim Rebecca as a 
member of the tribe and assume control of the baby if she is put up for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Polis said he also has "serious problems" with the law because it "really 
supersedes" a woman's constitutional right to choose whether she will terminate 
a pregnancy or not. In Argleben's case, Polis said, once she chose to have the 
child, and to put her up for adoption, the Indians were entitled to "take the 
baby away." 
</P>
<P>
But unless the law is revised by the U.S. Supreme Court or rewritten by 
Congress, Polis said, he must follow it. 
</P>
<P>
"It offends me dearly that they can reach out and define who is an Indian child 
and define themselves into existence and violate what I think are equally 
constitutional rights," Polis said. 
</P>
<P>
"The implication of what we have happening today is that a nation, in this case 
one that's 5,000 miles away, can literally dictate to a woman, literally reach 
into her womb and take away a right from her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Argleben repeated her vow to raise Rebecca herself rather 
than surrender the baby to the tiny fishing village of Akhiok on Alaska's 
Kodiak Island, where Argleben says she was abused by alcoholic parents. When 
she was 18 months old -- six years before the Indian Child Welfare Act was 
enacted -- Argleben was adopted by a non-Indian couple. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there," she said, referring to her visit to Akhiok last summer. 
"I've seen it. It's not the best place for her (Rebecca) to be raised. I don't 
want the same thing to happen to her that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Argleben said she is angry that the tribe is "trying to make my decisions for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
At another hearing next month, Argleben's lawyer will argue that a loophole in 
the law still permits her to override the tribe and win permission for a couple 
in Vancouver, Canada, to adopt Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
Argleben, a high school senior, resigned her tribal membership shortly after 
Rebecca was born, but the tribe responded by voting the baby in as a member. 
Argleben smuggled the baby to British Columbia in September to avoid giving the 
child to the tribe. She placed the baby with the Canadian couple and went into 
hiding. But the Aleuts located Rebecca and challenged the adoption. 
</P>
<P>
A judge in British Columbia ruled Jan. 5 that Canadian courts lacked 
jurisdiction to decide the case and ordered that Rebecca be returned to Orange 
County. But that move has been delayed while the proposed adoptive parents 
appeal the Canadian ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Polis ordered that Rebecca stay with the Canadian family at least until 
another court hearing in Orange County on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The husband of that Canadian couple, who have never been publicly identified, 
told The Times Friday that the Aleuts "don't give a damn about Rebecca." 
</P>
<P>
"It's sickening," he said. "The baby is chattel to them. She's got a loving 
family here and they want to yank her out of it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Aleuts' lawyers, Jack Trope of New York, told Polis that the courts 
have repeatedly upheld the Indians' right to keep babies in the tribe if their 
parents put them up for adoption. He cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last 
year that denied a Mississippi Choctaw couple the right to have their twins 
adopted by a non-Indian couple. 
</P>
<P>
In that ruling, the justices noted that the adoption rate among Indians is 
eight times higher than among non-Indians, and that 80% of those children are 
brought up by non-Indian families, Trope said. The justices also noted that 
Indian children often have "adjustment troubles" growing up outside their 
culture, Trope said. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the tribe's power to define who is and who isn't an Indian, Polis 
worried that the law could enable the tribe to "start reaching out and grabbing 
people of 1/64th or 1/28th (Indian blood) ad infinitum, to make anyone who has 
some Indian blood a member of the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
But Trope responded that the right to define membership is critical to the 
Indians' self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as it's within the right of the United States to decide who can be a 
citizen, it's within the right of the tribe to decide who's going to be a 
member," Trope said. 
</P>
<P>
Argleben's attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, said the Indian Child Welfare Act 
was intended to prevent the removal of Indian children from their families. He 
acknowledged that the "outflow" of Indian children into non-Indian families was 
so severe before the 1978 law was passed that "the culture and heritage of the 
Indians was being depleted." 
</P>
<P>
But in Rebecca's case, Van Deusen said, the Aleuts are trying to take her from 
the environment in which she and her mother were both raised. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indians don't have the right to take the child out of the Anglo community, 
out of its primary heritage, and create what they want: an Indian household," 
Van Deusen said.

In the city's largest cocaine bust ever, Orange police announced Friday the 
seizure of more than 70 kilograms of the drug, four handguns and $500,000 in 
cash as a result of a monthlong narcotics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two suspects in connection with the investigation that 
originated in Orange and led them to houses in Glendale and Century City, and a 
warehouse in downtown Los Angeles, Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest coke seizure we've ever had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Romo declined to release the names of the suspects, whom he identified as 
Colombian men. 
</P>
<P>
He said the information might hamper the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank and Glendale police helped serve search warrants at the three locations 
Thursday night, Romo said. MATT LAIT

REALTORS REAFFIRM PIERSIDE SUPPORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach-Fountain Valley Board of Realtors has reaffirmed its 
support of the controversial Pierside Village project in the Huntington Beach 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes redeveloping a paved area of the beach between Main and Lake 
streets, and building three or four new restaurants and a plaza of small shops. 
</P>
<P>
Two citizens' groups, Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Save Our Parks, vehemently 
oppose the project, charging that it would be a misuse of a public beach. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Van Tuyl, president of the realtors' board, wrote Mayor Thomas J. Mays 
this week that the board had "voted unanimously to reaffirm our support for the 
Pierside Village project." 
</P>
<P>
Van Tuyl's letter added: "As you all know, the board has long supported the 
Pierside Village concept, however, the decision to reaffirm our support was not 
automatic. In fact, we held a joint meeting of our board of directors and the 
Local Governmental Relations Committee and spent several hours reviewing the 
proposed plans and discussing issues of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that the new project will be a great asset to our city and 
will provide the much-needed public facilities to meet the needs of local 
residents and visitors alike." 
</P>
<P>
Van Tuyl's letter said the Pierside Village project "will transform a parking 
lot which has no public facilities at this time into more than 2.5 acres of 
public plazas and promenades, which will be open to public use." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also said the realtors believe "the project will not reduce access 
to the beach; it will facilitate access, especially for senior citizens, the 
handicapped and other citizens who may enjoy the opportunity for an ocean view 
and beachside experience in a different way." BILL BILLITER

CITY APPROVES FIRST ART UNDER '86 LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials this week approved the first project to meet the 1986 Art in 
Public Places requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The project, a tile composition by artist Marlo Bartels for the wall facing 
Laguna Canyon Road at the corner of the Sawdust Festival grounds, was proposed 
by the Sawdust Festival Board to satisfy requirements for the recent festival 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
The arts ordinance gives those who remodel or build commercial buildings and 
multiunit residential projects the option of acquiring and installing artwork 
or paying an art-in-lieu fee totaling 1% of the cost of construction, which is 
to be used to place art in other public places. 
</P>
<P>
Projects valued at less than $250,000 are exempt from the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Should a developer choose to install art, the ordinance states that a building 
permit will not be issued until the City Council approves the art. LESLIE

OFFICER'S PARTNER OFFERS HELPING HAND

<P>
Anaheim Police Officer Martin Curry knew his partner, Mike Helmick, needed some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick's wife, Nancy, 32, is suffering from a rare form of terminal cancer, 
and the insurance will no longer cover the enormous expense of further 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
So Curry looked to his friends, and the Chamber of Commerce, and organized a 
4,000-seat pancake breakfast this Sunday to raise funds to help pay for the 
mounting medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marty just saw another officer in need and decided to lend a helping 
hand," Detective Werner Raef said. "Everybody just kind of kicked in after that 
and really got on the bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
California Angels pitcher Jim Abbott will speak at the $3-per-person breakfast, 
made possible with the help of donations from Bridgford Foods, Karcher 
Enterprises, and Smart and Final Iris, organizer Tom Kissler said. 
</P>
<P>
Raef said many officers had transferred portions of their accumulated time off 
to Helmick so that he would be able to spend more time with his wife and 
3-year-old daughter Brittney. And about three months ago, the police 
association passed a hat around, collecting about $8,000 to help Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all together in a sort of a common cause," Kissler said. 
</P>
<P>
Raef expected about 250 members of the 320-officer force to attend the 
breakfast, which will be held from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Martin Hall in La 
Palma Park in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope the event will raise about $25,000 for Nancy Helmick, who has 
sarcoma cancer that attacks the lungs and heart. LISA MASCARO

FULL-TIME GRAFFITI REMOVER TO BE HIRED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week unanimously agreed to hire a worker whose full-time 
task will be to remove graffiti throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti has increased in recent years, making it cheaper to hire an employee 
than to continue to pay a private company to eradicate the paint, Community 
Services Director Ronald E. Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the worker, the city will purchase a truck and other equipment 
needed for the anti-graffiti effort. Yearly expenses should be about $52,000, 
about $8,000 less than the city pays to Commerce-based Graffiti Removal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers still will be used to paint out graffiti on some private property in 
the city. TOM McQUEENEY

Responding to concerns of neighbors that they are losing their views, the City 
Council voted this week to spend $8,800 on a study of whether legal 
restrictions on home heights are needed in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints stemmed mostly from older neighborhoods, where homeowners are 
adding second and third stories to small, single-level houses. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three big, ugly, humongous homes on our street that will take away 
our views and our privacy," said Irv Paul, who lives in one of the older 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Other homeowners said it would not be fair for the city to limit views that 
cannot be owned through a property deed. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Jenner, executive vice president of the South Orange County Board of 
Realtors, said home expansion regulations would be unfair because they could 
take away the potential for a homeowner to increase his property value. 
</P>
<P>
In a related item, the council voted to require that proposals for home 
additions must be accompanied by proof that the plans have been approved by 
their respective homeowners' associations. 
</P>
<P>
Using a checklist provided by the city, applicants for home additions will be 
on an honor system to produce evidence that their proposed plans meet 
homeowners' association standards. WENDY PAULSON

An Orange County Superior Court judge declined Friday to intervene in next 
month's special state Senate election, clearing an issue that could have been a 
financial setback for two Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William F. Rylaarsdam had been asked to prevent Assemblymen Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach) and Frank Hill (R-Whittier) from using money that they raised 
for their Assembly campaigns in the state Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
A complaint was filed earlier this month by another Republican candidate, Ron 
Isles, a Brea city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David A. Robinson, representing Hill, said the judge noted that the 
issue of transferring money between campaign committees is being considered in 
a separate federal lawsuit and said that any ruling should be made at that 
level. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Rylaarsdam let stand an opinion by the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission that permits the transfers. Both Hill and Ferguson said 
they obtained approval from the FPPC before they transferred the money. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, Isles and Ferguson are among eight candidates seeking to fill a vacancy 
left by the December resignation of state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights). 
</P>
<P>
The special primary is scheduled for Feb. 6. If none of the candidates receives 
more than 51% of the vote, a general election among the top vote-getters in 
each party will be held April 10. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate's 31st District straddles the boundary between Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. It stretches from Whittier and West Covina south to Laguna 
Beach.

POOL DEATH PROBATION CALLED TOO LENIENT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: TUSTIN DAY-CARE OPERATOR DESERVED JAIL TIME FOR LETTING THREE WARDS 
FALL IN POOL, DEPUTY D.A. SAYS. THE SURVIVING TODDLERS SUFFERED BRAIN DAMAGE.

Prosecutors said Friday they were disappointed in the probation sentence handed 
to the operator of a Tustin family day-care home where one toddler died and two 
others suffered permanent brain damage when they fell in a pool last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked more than what she was sentenced to," Orange County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Mark Jordan said. "Jail time would have been a fair response to 
what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brooks was convicted by a jury in Municipal Court in Santa Ana on 
Thursday of operating the day-care center without a license, a misdemeanor. She 
was sentenced to three years of informal probation, a fine and penalties 
totaling $1,500. She also was ordered never to run a day-care center without a 
judge's permission. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Gary Ryan gave Brooks until April 19 to pay the fine and 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Carol Brooks, 25, was acquitted by the jury after she testified 
that she was not an operator of the day-care program, but occasionally helped 
her mother, Jordan said. She was alone with the children on March 30 when the 
accident occurred. The three children were out of her sight while she changed 
the diaper of a fourth, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brooks' husband discovered the three toddlers floating in the back yard 
pool when he came home to the house on Old Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooks family theorizes that the children climbed atop toys to unhook the 
6-foot-high gate, which was latched shut but not locked. They apparently fell 
into the star-shaped pool just beyond the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-month-old Arthur Matthew Griese of Orange died the next day. The other 
two children -- Melissa Polsfoot and Jonathan Derek Weston, both of Tustin and 
now 2 years old -- suffered severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office concluded that Diana Brooks had taken 
precautions to keep the children away from the pool by installing the 
chain-link fence with a padlocked gate, and ruled out any felony charges of 
involuntary manslaughter or child endangerment, which carry potential prison 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
However, the padlock had been removed at the request of the County Social 
Services Agency because it was considered a fire safety hazard, prosecutor 
Jordan said. But Diana Brooks did not resecure or replace the gate as required 
by the county agency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both defendants pleaded innocent, arguing that county social worker Winifred 
Schuberg specifically told them they could run the center while a license 
application for Brooks was pending. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schuberg denied that in testimony. She said that she twice ordered the 
day-care center closed -- in July, 1988, and January, 1989 -- while the 
application was being processed. 
</P>
<P>
The next month, social services representatives sent the Brookses a follow-up 
letter stressing the importance of following regulations and obtaining a 
license, Schuberg said. Brooks, she said, ignored the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, parents of the three children have filed lawsuits against 
Diana Brooks and Orange County, which is responsible for licensing day-care 
centers. All three suits are pending.

FIDELITY FINANCIAL SELLING STOCK BACK TO HAMMOND CO.

Irvine-based Fidelity National Financial Inc. said Friday that it will sell its 
23.6% interest in the Hammond Co. and that Hammond will pay $1.9 million to 
purchase the Fidelity stake. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends seven months of sporadic talks between the two firms about 
establishing closer business ties or a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond directors and shareholders now will consider turning the publicly 
traded firm into a private company, said company Chairman Thomas T. Hammond. 
About 10 of the Newport Beach company's 400 shareholders own about 60% of the 
firm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said the company will use its cash reserves to purchase the stock. 
</P>
<P>
After a recent meeting, Fidelity executives decided that "a mutually agreeable 
business operation wouldn't be forthcoming, and we didn't want to pursue 
Hammond in a hostile nature," said Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's executive vice 
president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity, a title insurance firm operating in 31 states, agreed to sell its 
stake to Hammond for $4.83 a share -- the estimated price Fidelity paid for the 
Hammond stock. 
</P>
<P>
"We never got around to talking seriously about an acquisition," Willey said. 
"Our conceptual discussions were far enough apart."

HUMOR: RITA RUDNER, WHO APPEARED AT THE LAFF STOP THURSDAY, HAS A STYLE THAT IS 
FORTHRIGHT YET, AT THE SAME TIME, DRAWS HER AUDIENCE IN.

<P>
Rita Rudner doesn't bite, she nibbles. She doesn't strangle, she massages. 
Rudner tickles instead of scratches. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sometimes she scratches. But she's almost apologetic about it. Even when 
she wants to dig in, the plunge seems unthreatening, like someone trying to be 
tough while waving a rubber knife. 
</P>
<P>
Like at the Laff Stop on Thursday night, when she started picking on a pretty 
blonde in the front row. The dark-haired, New York-experienced Rudner tried to 
get into it; she really wanted to capitalize on all that Orange County 
all-Americanism in the audience, but as soon as her teeth started to show, the 
politeness welled up. Oh, this girl isn't so bad. . . . 
</P>
<P>
See, Rudner has this style. With her fey persona, she's a little like a hip, 
slightly touched relative who speaks up and keeps amazing the family with all 
the tilted things she says. They're peculiar musings, often wistful, sometimes 
startling. But she doesn't unnerve you. She draws you in. 
</P>
<P>
You dig listening to her. Like when she worries about how hard it must be to 
skywrite in Japan. All those funny letters to deal with. Or why baking soda has 
so many uses. "It's clearly a substance in need of some direction." Or the 
effects vegetarianism had on her. "I kept leaning toward the sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband wanted her to buy a leather dress. "I never knew how uncomfortable 
cows can be. That 'moo' is a cry for help." She heard a friend's new baby 
bawling. "It was like a mating cry to a car alarm." She wonders if she and her 
husband should have a baby -- or get a dog. "Should we ruin our carpet, or ruin 
our lives?" 
</P>
<P>
And her new house in Beverly Hills? Yipes! It's not finished, and all the help 
has an attitude. The painter won't spackle or tape, so when the exterminator 
comes over and asks what the job is, she tells him to kill the painter. But 
then what do you do about all the mice? 
</P>
<P>
She goes to the hardware store to get poison, and the tamper-proof bottle has 
been tampered with. Should she buy it? Maybe someone has filled it with 
Tylenol. She dwells on the mice: "I could be curing their headaches." 
</P>
<P>
And how do you decorate the home? Living in hotels on the road has left her 
with some bad ideas: There are two double beds in the living room and she's 
nailed down all the lamps. The household contraptions are baffling, especially 
the lawn sprinkler. How do you get it to work? "As close as I can figure, it's 
triggered by rain." 
</P>
<P>
OK, that's enough. It's tempting to keep quoting her routine because it's so 
good. Thursday's one-night stand was typical of her ability to establish 
rapport, not always such an easy thing for a comedian. Too often, there's a 
stridency, a demand in the jokes that separates us, but not with her. 
</P>
<P>
She does without all those heavy-grade twitches and ticks and human drum rolls 
that so many use to cue their gags. Instead, Rudner utilizes dead-eye timing 
and a humanizing natural quality that communicates the heart of her work. 
</P>
<P>
She can get a little cute -- the vaguely surreal knock-off of a LaLa Land 
Gracie Allen gets too wide-eyed as she dawdles at the microphone -- but even 
that only puts our attention on hold for a minute. Rudner has a way of getting 
us back -- she just starts talking again.

BROKEN TILES BECOME FUNCTIONAL ART IN HANDS OF LAGUNA BEACH CERAMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You may not know Marlo Bartels by name, but chances are you sat on his art. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, you may have rested on "Elements," a bench aptly 
titled for the sphere, cube, cone and cylindrical shapes that adorn it. You may 
have quenched your thirst at his drinking fountain wall. Or watched the sun set 
while relaxing at his "Canyon Chess Table and Chairs," a permanent exhibit at 
Laguna's Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bartels transforms mundane subjects -- furniture, bathrooms, Jacuzzis -- into 
functional art from broken tiles that he buys secondhand or finds while rooting 
through dumpsters behind commercial tile companies. He crowns each piece with 
handmade tiles of swirls and flame shapes he designs in his Laguna Canyon 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
His work can be found in homes throughout Orange County and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old former art teacher claims inspiration from Antonio Gaudi, an 
internationally acclaimed Barcelona architect and pioneer in organic 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Bartels and his wife Cathy -- also an artist -- visited Spain and were 
excited by Gaudi's work. "Organic architecture follows the laws of nature. The 
Parque Guell is a huge park that Gaudi designed. He added benches that he had 
his assistant, Jujol, create out of broken, colored tiles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This came about, he explains, when one of Gaudi's patrons who owned a tile 
plant gave the assistant access to castoffs that later became an integral part 
of Gaudi's creation. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the idea a step further seemed natural to the ceramist, who sought to 
express his feelings about Southern California life style through his art. 
</P>
<P>
Enamored of the American Arts and Crafts Movement of 1880-1930 and the vivid 
bursts of color found in tableware and pottery during the period, Bartels began 
incorporating bold colors into his tile work. 
</P>
<P>
"During the early 1970s, artists were producing art that related to them and 
their environment. My experience wasn't 'gritty New York'; it was California 
landscapes, the beach, the bold sunsets in reds and blues and purples." 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in Los Angeles, the native says he knew early on that he 
"wanted to leave a lasting impression on the world." At 20, he took a first 
step on the road he was to travel: "I happened upon a ceramics class in junior 
college and it just felt right; I found that I liked working with my hands." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to earn a master's degree in art at Cal State Fullerton. His 
one-of-a-kind pottery caught the attention of a tableware design broker who 
hired him to create dinnerware patterns for a Japan-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
From 1974 until 1977, Bartels taught art classes at the Art Institute of 
Southern California (formerly the Laguna Beach School of Art) and continues to 
serve on the Artists' Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very much into recycling. I prefer using castoffs. I hate to throw 
anything away. I save bits and scraps until I have a use for them." His first 
creation -- a chair -- evolved from a base of polystyrene remnants that he 
pieced together and used as a form. 
</P>
<P>
The best results have often come by accident, Bartels said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the side effects of working in clay is breakage. Tiles crack, they 
warp, they shatter. I go with the flow." According to Bartels, when he started 
making murals, tile borders would invariably warp during the drying phase: "I 
thought this shape would make an interesting chair back." 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a form made from wood and polystyrene or steel covered with metal 
mesh, Bartels then coats the foundation with mortar. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he applies the broken tile pieces. Handmade tile shapes are added to fit 
the form; swirled tiles for armrests, curved tiles for backs and around 
corners. Several painstaking steps follow -- drying, bisque firing, glaze 
applications and glaze firing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the handmade tiles can be applied to the surface with a thin-set 
mortar. The last step is grouting to fill spaces between tile. He delivers 
finished pieces within a few days of completion, but it may take up to a month 
for grout work to "cure." 
</P>
<P>
Home Savings -- famous for exterior murals -- has commissioned his design work 
at branches in California, Florida and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But Bartels' favorite clients are ones who give him carte blanche; clients 
including CBS Morning News' Kathleen Sullivan, whose New York penthouse kitchen 
features his work. Or Steven Gumpert, a Newport Beach commercial real estate 
developer and his wife, Cassandra. They gave him artistic license to design a 
wall headboard and bedside tables, hat rack and umbrella stand to complement 
their Belcourt home. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gumperts had seen photographs of the Sullivan kitchen during a visit to 
New York. They had an idea of what they wanted, then let me take over," Bartels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Gumpert said he likes black as a color. "Marlo uses a lot of black with 
bright color; his work is very exciting to me," Gumpert said. 
</P>
<P>
For Cassandra Gumpert, it was a combination of drama and fun that struck her 
fancy. "When we were at his studio looking at his pieces it was so tempting to 
say 'Let's do the whole house in Marlo's work,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Paulson, a Newport Beach stockbroker, and his wife, Suzanne, imposed no 
restrictions when Bartels designed the electric blue Jacuzzi and oversized 
shower stall for their newly remodeled Emerald Bay master bedroom. "Suzanne and 
I were leaving for India (and) Nepal; we said, 'Surprise us.' We were very 
pleased with the results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans include grand corporate projects for clients in Japan, Italy and 
Spain. "I find Spain a most inspiring country because of the Moorish tile 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Other plans include the completion of the family "dream home" in Bluebird 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited because our neighbor and architect, Dann McMann, 
specializes in hillside homes. This living space will be a laboratory; a 
testing ground for tile ideas I am experimenting with," he said. The entire 
home will be "festooned with tile." 
</P>
<P>
From the time a custom order is confirmed -- his trademark multicolor bordered 
bench is $2,000 -- it takes Bartels about six weeks to deliver. A recently 
completed 9-by-5-foot fountain with five-foot long ceramic, mythical, 
dragonlike fish sold for $10,000. Large commercial murals range from $30,000 to 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bartels' passion extends beyond working in tile; he lends his staunch support 
to Tile Heritage, based in Northern California, and Friends of Terra Cotta, 
based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups are made up of artists and tile historians devoted to preserving 
the history of American tile and architectural ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
"Architectural terra cotta became an art form unto itself; it was an 
inexpensive way of reproducing neoclassic carved stone on building facades," he 
said. "It is imperative that building owners be aware of the care needed to 
preserve the lasting beauty of this incredible material."

BUYER BEWARE? NOT IF HOME GETS INSPECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County Life.

Seems simple: to check the sink plumbing for leaks, turn on the water and look 
for drips. Not quite, says Jack Gerwick. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to turn just the hot water on and let it run. That makes the pipes 
expand and leaks show up right away. If you just used cold water, you might not 
see them," Gerwick said as he leaned inside a cabinet to feel a drain pipe for 
tell-tale moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick is a house sleuth for Inspector Homes, a Laguna Beach home inspection 
service. On this recent afternoon, he crawled, climbed, peered and prodded his 
way through an Irvine tract home, meticulously recording each flaw he ferreted 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with his five-page report, the people buying this house will know exactly 
what they're walking into on moving day. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents say home inspectors are indispensable for home buyers, most 
of whom probably think a ground fault interrupter is something that stops 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"In real estate the main thing used to be location, location, location. Now 
everybody wants disclosure, disclosure, disclosure," said Cheri Jessup, an 
agent with Whitewater Realty in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard form that sellers fill out now really doesn't tell all that much 
about the house. A home inspection lets the buyer see in great detail what 
shape the house is in. And it gives the seller much more protection down the 
line because there are no surprises." 
</P>
<P>
The dozens of home inspection companies in Orange County offer scrutiny of 
varying thoroughness at prices that range from about $115 to as much as $400. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers of existing homes generally line up a home inspection company through 
their real estate agents. Buyers of new homes or those buying existing homes 
without an agent can find inspection companies in the phone directory, through 
recommendations from friends or neighbors or through the California Real Estate 
Assn. in Sacramento, a trade organization that provides standards and education 
for member companies. 
</P>
<P>
While home inspection clients are mainly buyers of existing homes, buyers of 
new homes can use an inspection to head off a lot of hassles. 
</P>
<P>
"If the house is not done right, it's not right," said Vince Von Lenhoff, 
co-owner with his wife, Carol of Inspector Homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a buyer have to fight for a year saying all the windows don't open 
right. By inspecting it ahead of time, he can have it right there in the paper 
work from the start and have a much better chance of getting it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers also can benefit from getting the inside story on their property. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone may have lived in a house for 25 years, but they can't see some things 
that may be wrong," Von Lenhoff said. "But if somebody unbiased from outside 
comes in, they can find the little leak under the sink or the foundation crack 
in the garage." 
</P>
<P>
The seller can use this information to get the house in the best condition for 
sale, Von Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
A detailed inspection of a typical three-bedroom home can take about two hours 
and includes a close look at the home's construction, electrical supply, 
plumbing, fireplaces, insulation, heating and cooling equipment, appliances and 
roof. Inspectors check things as simple as whether windows open easily or 
whether there is enough water pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Most inspection companies do not deal with solar heating and security systems, 
water purifiers, pool and spa construction and certain other equipment. They 
refer clients to firms that specialize in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
As Gerwick got ready to begin his recent inspection of the Irvine home, the 
buyers were absent. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers should insist on being present for the home inspection, Carol Von 
Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're buying a house, you should take two hours off work and come to the 
inspection. That way we can explain things that are in the report. Something 
like 'crack in living room ceiling' might look bad on paper, but in person we 
can show that it's just a minor effect of normal settling. We can save the 
buyer the aggravation, tension and worry and make the transaction go a lot more 
smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick, a general contractor for 30 years before he went to work for Inspector 
Homes last year, began his inspection in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
He opened drawers and windows, checked plumbing connections and tested 
electrical outlets to make sure they were grounded and wired properly. He 
switched on the garbage disposal and ran the dishwasher through an entire 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
A pocket door was a little tough to open. "One little shaker (earthquake) can 
make one of these tough to open," Gerwick said. 
</P>
<P>
As he moved from room to room, Gerwick kept careful notes. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be thorough but not nit-picky," he said. "I base the inspection on 
the age of the house. Something that might be normal for a 10-year-old house -- 
small cracks at the corners of doors or windows or drywall nails popped out 
after small earthquakes -- might be signs of trouble in a brand new home." 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick stuck his head inside the living room fireplace to make sure there were 
no gaps between the firebricks, that the damper worked and that there was no 
dangerous build-up of flammable creosote in the flue. 
</P>
<P>
He examined the ceiling in every room for evidence of water stains from roof 
leaks, and the walls for evidence of cracking that would indicate more than 
usual settling of the house. 
</P>
<P>
In the bathrooms, he flushed the toilets, checked them and other plumbing for 
leaks, and noted that an electrical outlet was not equipped with a ground fault 
interrupter, a device designed to prevent accidental electrical shocks around 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was built before they were required," Gerwick said, "but I'll 
mention it anyway so the buyers are aware. It might be something they want to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, inspectors encounter homeowners who cover up problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people throw towels over the glass door of the shower. You look 
underneath and find a crack in the glass. If you find one sneaky thing like 
that, you look harder for other problems," Vince Von Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I inspected the attic in one house and came down and asked the owner if she'd 
ever had any roof leaks. She said no. I said, 'Well, I'm not saying you're not 
telling the truth but there are buckets up there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Von Lenhoff said he once got a call from a buyer who asked why he hadn't been 
told about the secret room. "The previous owners had built a hidden room and 
sealed it with a panel that was screwed down. We had no idea it was there. An 
inspector is only as good as what he can see." 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick took great pains to see as much as he could get to in his inspection of 
the Irvine house. He crawled into the attic through a ceiling access panel and 
walked about in the darkness checking wiring, insulation and roof vents with 
his flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
In the garage, Gerwick inspected the furnace filter and gas connections. He 
manually turned on the heat and air conditioning to make sure they worked. He 
checked the water heater plumbing. He checked the electrical outlets and found 
one, a 220-volt outlet for a clothes dryer, that was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick clicked the garage door closer and found to his dismay that the huge 
door did not stop its descent when he tried to block it with his body. "That's 
a problem," he said. "Should have gone back up as soon as it hit me. Don't want 
kids or pets to get caught under it." He made a notation in his report. 
</P>
<P>
He took one turn around the outside of the house looking for improper drainage 
and foundation cracks. He found several hairline cracks but said those are 
normal. "I'm looking for cracks you can stick your little finger into." 
</P>
<P>
Then he headed for the last inspection: the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Von Lenhoff said roof checks are especially important because roof 
repairs are expensive and appearances can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing I do when I come into the neighborhood is look at the roofs of the 
other houses. If you see a bunch of new roofs in a tract, you can suspect that 
the roof on the house you're inspecting is near the end of its life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to check even new roofs. I was on one, brand new, and found that 
it was laid improperly over an old wood shingle roof and someone had walked on 
it and cracked the new shingles. Brand new roof and it leaked." 
</P>
<P>
Gerwick completed his survey of the roof, finding a few places where shingles 
were missing and leaks were possible. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the ground, as he maneuvered his ladder in the front yard, he stepped 
into a rose bush and ripped a huge hole in his pants. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged off the damage with a laugh. "That's just part of the job of trying 
to give the buyer a little peace of mind." 
</P>

LIVING AGAIN IN GLASS HOUSES

<P>
Elyse Froehlich was overwhelmed the first time she made a nighttime visit to 
her nearly completed custom home in Capistrano Beach. Exterior lights glowed 
and twinkled through a 21-by-21-foot curved stairwell wall of jewel-like glass 
blocks, creating a stunning, dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to understand what something like this is actually gonna be 
like from a drawing," Froehlich says. "The impact, it's like so strong. And 
when you come down from the top of the bridge (staircase) to the landing, it's 
just such a powerful experience." 
</P>
<P>
Froehlich, a painter, had told the architect that glass block was one of the 
elements that she and her husband, Richard, a cardiologist, really liked. And 
she wanted the house to function as a sculpture, an artwork in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 6,000-square-foot house that incorporates glass block as a 
major design element throughout, giving this contemporary home with classical 
elements a flowing continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Glass blocks, which were at a peak of popularity in this country during the 
1920s and '30s, enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s as homeowners and architects 
rediscovered this aesthetically pleasing and functional building material. 
</P>
<P>
Glass blocks are being used with increasing frequency in contemporary custom 
homes being designed in Orange County, according to local architects, designers 
and masons who install them. Tract-home designers are also beginning to 
incorporate glass block. One 133-unit tract of Huntington Beach homes will 
include thousands of glass blocks to provide diffused light while maintaining 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Glass blocks are being used for walls, facades, stairwells, windows and 
interior partitions, including curved shower stall walls. The blocks are 
durable and easy to maintain, and provide more security than regular glass 
because they are hard to break. And they are available in varied designs, 
ranging from clear to opaque, allowing a clear view, an obscured view or 
complete privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Blocks are also available in varied sizes, from four-inch-square to 
12-inch-square. Rectangular blocks are also available in some sizes. Prices 
vary from $3 for a small, simple block up to $100 apiece for glass blocks that 
are custom-etched. 
</P>
<P>
In most installations, however, labor is the biggest cost, ranging from $28 to 
$60 per square foot. Frequently masons must make tricky on-site adjustments to 
turn an architect's concept into a reality. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for glass blocks has gone up significantly, especially in the 
residential market, according to Richard Carey, architectural representative 
for the Angelus Block Co. of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Angelus is a distributor for Pittsburg Corning Corp., the only U.S. 
manufacturer of glass blocks. He says his company has enjoyed "substantial 
increases every year." 
</P>
<P>
"Architects suddenly latched onto the product and started doing some very 
unique designs," Carey says. "A product like this allows them to design-in 
privacy and allow light and incorporate architectural elements that were never 
used, can't be done with other materials." 
</P>
<P>
"We almost use it in every appropriate project," says James Gartner of his 
Santa Ana firm, James Gartner &amp; Associates, Architects. "We're going back 
to the decorative style of architecture." 
</P>
<P>
He says people are returning to "a combination of contemporary and decorative 
(styles), and glass block seems to work in both cases. It works as a high-tech 
material, and it works as a decorative material." 
</P>
<P>
In the Froehlich home, for instance, the blocks do not have the cold feel that 
might be expected. Instead, the light that flows through is warm and soothing. 
</P>
<P>
In a large, white, ceramic-tile shower in the master bath, for instance, there 
are two windows made of eight-inch-square glass blocks. The window facing a 
neighboring house has textured blocks for privacy at a lower level and clear 
blocks higher up. The window facing the ocean has clear blocks and allows a 
person to shower while watching the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the master bath, a whirlpool tub is surrounded by white ceramic tile 
and black marble. An eight-foot-long, glass-block window above the tub lets 
light in but provides privacy too. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-inch-square blocks used in the curved stairwell wall are a mix of 
clear blocks and ones with a wavy design that partly obscures the view of a 
neighboring house. Through the clear blocks, the sky and tall trees are 
visible,and there is a glimpse of the neighboring house. Columns of 
earth-colored caldura stone and a wool Berber carpet in a peach/mauve color add 
to the warm feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Froehlich's studio has an eight-foot-by-12-foot glass-block window with a 
special feature. Six windows that open are set into the rest. And in the living 
room and family room, 12-inch-square glass blocks are set into the wall about 
two feet apart, above French doors with a view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the uniqueness of it isn't just the fact that it's glass block," 
says Jim Pepperell of Jim Pepperell Enterprises Inc. of Laguna Niguel, the 
general contractor on the Froehlich home. "It's all the different ways it's 
been used. It's just about covering the whole spectrum of any possible way you 
could use glass block." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of elegance is not cheap, however. The glass block and the 
installation of the curved stairwell wall alone cost about $19,000, according 
to Tom Justus of Justus Masonry, Cerritos. His company did the installation, 
which took about three weeks to complete. Special reinforcement of the wall 
brought the total cost to about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Less elaborate installations of glass blocks are more common. 
</P>
<P>
Arta Alexander of Fullerton wanted to brighten up a dark doorway. She had two 
narrow doors in the entry of her home replaced with one standard door and one 
vertical row of 7 1/2-inch-square glass blocks. Alexander, a landscape 
designer, is pleased with the result -- a warm, brighter entry and light for 
nearby planter. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Pete Rose of Balboa Pacific in Balboa was asked to create a design 
using glass block to brighten a remodeling effort by a development company on a 
Balboa home. In the master bath, he designed two pyramid-shaped windows that 
are mirror images on each side of a corner above the bath. There are four rows 
of 12-inch-square glass blocks in the windows, laid in stairstep fashion from 
five blocks on the bottom row to one at the top. 
</P>
<P>
The bathroom floor and walls are dark brown, gold and black slate, so the 
windows provide much-needed light. Another vertical row of three glass blocks 
is used on a slate divider between the tub and toilet. And in the bedroom, a 
five-foot-by-six-foot glass block window provides diffused light with privacy. 
The windows will be lighted at night with spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
He is also planning a counter that will have a wood top and a glass block base. 
A fluorescent light under the counter will shine down on the glass blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pointe, a tract of 133 homes built closely together in Huntington Beach, 
features still more uses of glass block. Mike Araujo of Mike's Masonry, 
Huntington Beach, says he will use 14,000 glass blocks in the 83 homes being 
framed. 
</P>
<P>
Since neighboring houses are so close, a conventional kitchen window would 
provide only a view of someone else's wall. So the designers put two long 
vertical rows of eight-inch glass blocks over the cooktop. The result is light 
and airy. The blocks are also used for windows upstairs and near the 
first-floor powder room, and as curved windows in entries. 
</P>
<P>
In one model, a bath has three 12-inch blocks set into the wall above a mirror, 
about a foot apart. In a guest bedroom, three 12-inch blocks are set into the 
wall in a vertical row, about six inches apart. Another use is to place five 
12-inch blocks in a horizontal row, high on a bedroom wall and spaced about a 
foot apart. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about it," says Araujo of glass block, "is the way the sun 
illuminates it." 
</P>
<P>
He says that when sunlight hits glass blocks just right, it's akin to looking 
at a kaleidoscope because of all the colors refracted in the glass.

SHAPES, SIZES AND PRICES OF THE ONCE-LOWLY SPIGOT HAVE CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Once the most utilitarian of household hardwares, the lowly faucet, has become 
a real turn-on. 
</P>
<P>
It's no longer enough that the water runs hot and cold. Discriminating 
homeowners want spigots that make statements. As a result, faucets have gone 
from functional to fancy -- and even funky. 
</P>
<P>
Many people favor the sleek, streamlined models that look like they're going to 
take off from the sink and wing around the bathroom. Some contemporary faucets 
resemble abstract sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County hardware stores such as West End West in Laguna Beach and Amco 
Builders Supply in Costa Mesa carry faucets to suit every fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the contemporary ones. They're very elaborate but understated," says 
Sandy Kedhar, sounding much like a faucet connoisseur as she shopped at Amco 
for faucets to fit her new home in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a custom home and I want to have something unusual," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
How about a jet-black faucet shaped like a crowbar? An elegant, gold, 
crescent-shaped spout with malachite handles? A gold-plated swan that spills 
water out of its beak, or an elaborate brass dolphin that pours water from its 
mouth? 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor contemporary decors can find futuristic faucets in assorted 
geometric shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Modern spigots by Eurotect Ltd. feature pyramids, cylinders, blocks and ovals 
that fit together like building blocks in split finishes of brass and chrome. 
One faucet has two triangular levers and a pyramid-shaped head. 
</P>
<P>
Decorators with old-fashioned tastes can choose the Georgian faucets with 
traditional brass spouts and white porcelain cross handles. For a more elegant 
look, they can substitute crystal handles or S-shaped levers with intricate 
scrollwork. 
</P>
<P>
Spigots, like people, come in all shapes -- tall and slender, short and squat, 
angular and round. Bar faucets, which have found their way into the kitchen and 
bath, have skinny goose necks. Dramatic "C Spouts" by Altmans form a sweeping 
"C" out of faux malachite, lapis or black granite. 
</P>
<P>
Semi-precious stones and metals adorn the fancier faucets. The brass plumbing 
comes plated in chrome, nickel, brass finish or even 24-karat gold. Amco 
carries a copper faucet, shiny as a new penny, with pink quartz handles. 
</P>
<P>
Decorators can choose cylinder-shaped handles that have interchangeable rings 
of amethyst, malachite, crystal, onyx, ivory, lapis and other semi-precious 
stones. The cobra ring by Altmans has a coiled-up snake with ruby or emerald 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Water does not merely dribble out of such fantastic faucets. It flows in 
rivulets down a triple aqueduct, or spews out in a thin ribbon from a flat, 
razor-thin opening. It slides down a curved sheet of metal or rolls down 
several tiers into the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the water on can also be an adventure. Contemporary levers, with their 
abstract domes, cylinders and blocks, offer no hints as to whether one pulls, 
pushes or twists. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic faucets have no levers at all. They're activated by an infrared 
switch that turns on and off when the user puts his hands underneath the spout. 
</P>
<P>
"They're used a lot in commercial buildings, but now we're finding people want 
them in their homes, too," says Steven Goldstein, an owner of West End West. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to new technology, homeowners have never enjoyed greater selection in 
faucets. 
</P>
<P>
Decorators can now buy faucets in any color, thanks to the development of 
powder coats of paint that are baked onto the brass fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
"White powder coats are the hottest thing right now," says David Schuck, 
co-owner of West End West. 
</P>
<P>
With their clean lines, the white faucets look great in contemporary kitchens. 
Black and vivid red faucets have also upstaged the traditional chrome spigots. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary faucets owe their bulky geometric shapes to an engineering 
technique in which each piece is cut from bars of solid brass instead of cast 
from a mold, then milled and machined for a glossy look. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners willingly splurge on such innovations. 
</P>
<P>
Most designer faucets cost $400 to $600, with the traditional ones starting at 
$200 and the contemporary ones at $300. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the prices go up -- and up and up," Goldstein says. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fluctuate depending on the faucet's design and materials. At West End 
West, a gold-plated swan sells for $560, a modern waterfall faucet for $800 and 
the Wedgewood china faucet for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some pay as much as $2,000 for custom-made, gold-plated faucets with 
semi-precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
People will pay more for fancy faucets because "the home is becoming vitally 
important," Goldstein says. 
</P>
<P>
"They're spending a lot of money on and in the home, so they're willing to 
spend a little extra to get the finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, they'd spend all this money on furniture and wallpaper for the living 
room and bedrooms, but they'd neglect the bath and kitchen. Now they're looking 
at the faucets." And faucets have never looked better. 
</P>
