WOMAN, BLACK NAMED TO S.D. PORT DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Breaking the all-white, all-male lock on the San Diego Unified Port District, 
the San Diego City Council on Tuesday appointed a black investment-firm 
executive and a woman attorney to the wealthy and influential agency that 
controls state tidelands around San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford Graves, former chief administrative officer for San Diego County, and 
Lynn Schenk, the only woman ever to head the state Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency, were selected on the second ballot, after they and labor leader 
Joseph Francis fell one vote short of the five-vote majority needed for 
selection in the first round of voting. 
</P>
<P>
When he takes over Feb. 8, Graves will become the first black on the board 
since the tenure of Alois Smith ended in 1980 and only the second appointed in 
the agency's 28 years of existence. Schenk will be the third woman to serve on 
the seven-member panel and the first since Maureen O'Connor was denied 
reappointment to a second term in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Schenk said her top priorities will be the relocation of 
Lindbergh Field -- which the Port District controls -- pollution in San Diego 
Bay and promoting more opportunity for employment of women and minorities, 
including contractors. The Port District has been criticized for a poor record 
of hiring Latinos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Graves said he wants to begin by examining the balance between tourist-related 
industries and commercial and industrial concerns under Port District control. 
He added the airport relocation issue and municipal demands for a share of the 
port's sizable revenues as top issues. 
</P>
<P>
The appointments end -- for now -- weeks of back-corridor jockeying for the 
prestigious posts and satisfy the longstanding demand of minority activists for 
representation on the Port District, a demand that grew louder when the panel 
last year refused the City Council's request to name the city's new bayfront 
convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment "sends a signal back to blacks and Hispanics, and, with the 
appointment of Lynn, to others, that the City Council has heard their concerns 
and is responding," Graves told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time for a change," said Councilman Wes Pratt, who had nominated Graves 
for the post. 
</P>
<P>
The choices -- and Francis' showing -- also reflect the substantial shift in 
the council's leanings since the defeat of Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl in 
last year's elections. Building industry lobbyist Paul Peterson and former 
Councilman Bill Cleator, Establishment candidates who might have expected to be 
leading contenders for the Port District posts if last year's moderate to 
conservative bloc were still in control, were never really in the running 
Tuesday. Cleator did not even show up for Tuesday's public hearing and vote. 
</P>
<P>
But the council still faces two potentially divisive related issues. The 
council deferred a decision on which appointee will replace which outgoing port 
commissioner, Louis Wolfsheimer and William Rick. Wolfsheimer's term expires 
Jan. 2, 1991, less than a year after either Graves or Schenk takes over his 
spot. Commissioner William Rick's tenure is scheduled to end Jan. 2, 1993, 
giving his replacement a longer first term. 
</P>
<P>
Rick and Wolfsheimer were given special permission by the council to serve 
third terms to complete construction of the San Diego Convention Center. Both 
agreed at the time of their reappointments that they would step down when the 
convention center was completed. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was sent to the council's Rules Committee and could come up Feb. 7, 
the same day that the committee is scheduled to discuss whether the council has 
the authority to oust W. Daniel Larsen, its third appointee to the seven- 
member panel. City Atty. John Witt ruled Friday that the council cannot take 
that action without demonstrating misconduct by Larsen, but at least three 
council members disagree. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Coronado, Imperial Beach, National City and Chula Vista each have 
one appointee on the Board of Port Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
With each council member entitled to two votes Tuesday, Graves won his spot 
with the support of Ron Roberts, John Hartley, Pratt, Linda Bernhardt and Bob 
Filner. Schenk received her five votes from council members Abbe Wolfsheimer, 
Roberts, Pratt, Bernhardt and Filner. 
</P>
<P>
Filner cinched Graves' appointment by dropping his first-ballot allegiance to 
his nominee, attorney Daniel Guevara, after Guevara received just one vote on 
the first round. Roberts provided Schenk's fifth vote on the second round after 
casting his first ballot for his nominee, attorney John Davies, who also 
received only one vote on the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who had said she would not participate in the vote 
because she believes port commissioners should be elected, was attending a U.S. 
Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The council's questioning of the eight nominees for the coveted posts was 
genteel throughout a hearing that began late Tuesday morning and continued, 
after the council's two-hour lunch recess, into the mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Graves, for example, was not asked about his 1985 resignation from the top 
county job under pressure after a major scandal over a telephone contract that 
led to the indictment of 13 people, and allegations of mismanagement involving 
his appointed department directors. 
</P>
<P>
Schenk's bitter feud with County Supervisor Susan Golding, which culminated in 
Schenk winning a $150,000 out-of-court settlement in 1988 of her slander 
lawsuit against Golding, never surfaced, either. The 1984 legal action stemmed 
from a campaign mailer from Golding about opponent Schenk the day before the 
November election in which Golding was first elected to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the hearing served as a summation of the major issues facing the Port 
District, including the Lindbergh relocation, pollution of San Diego Bay, the 
port's responsiveness to the public, equal opportunity, shared funding, an 
expected lawsuit by the convention center contractor and San Diego's ambition 
to be a center of international trade. 
</P>
<P>
Most candidates offered little in the way of concrete solutions, stressing 
their qualifications and commitment to delve into the issues.

ROMAN VISHNIAC; FAMED PHOTOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Vishniac, who as a young scientist in Eastern Europe produced a 
poignantly powerful series of photographs that recorded the faces of fellow 
Jews approaching their doom, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The zoologist and biologist, who later in his life concentrated on the minute 
life seen only through a microscope, was 92 when he died Monday in his New York 
City apartment of the complications of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, Vishniac, who held a doctorate in zoology, embarked on a 5,000-mile, 
three-year odyssey that took him through the terror-stricken ghettos of Eastern 
Europe, photographing the ravaged and haunted faces of a people that were 
unknowingly about to disappear in the Nazi slaughters of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to say he took Hitler seriously and therefore he took the pictures," 
said a relative, Jesse Cherry. "Everything he photographed was subsequently 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Russia, Vishniac turned from medical science photography to the eyes of 
undernourished children, of bearded patriarchs, of families in tattered 
clothing buying an occasional apple to supplement their meager daily fare. 
</P>
<P>
What remained of his collection after he fled to the United States in 1940 was 
ultimately displayed in art museums and libraries around the world and praised 
not only for the tragedy it mirrored but for the starkness and lighting of his 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Vishniac first became interested in both science and photography as a boy when 
he photographed a cockroach's leg through a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
After he moved to Berlin in the 1920s he had to pose as a Nazi, for any Jew 
with a camera was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
After fleeing Germany he was interned briefly in a Vichy concentration camp in 
France but managed to obtain visas and escaped to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
He was unable to speak English but still eked out a living as a portrait 
photographer before launching yet another career as a microphotographer. He won 
prizes for pictures that ranged from insects to frost on a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the International Fund for Concerned Photography mounted an exhibition 
of Vishniac's photographs that also included his scientific work, such as 
polarized light shots of microscopic creatures. 
</P>
<P>
In an introduction to the exhibition, the photographer Edward Steichen wrote: 
"Roman Vishniac came back from his trips to Eastern Europe in the 1930s with a 
collection of photographs that has become an important historical document, for 
it gives a last-minute look at the human beings he photographed just before the 
fury of Nazi brutality exterminated them. The resulting photographs are among 
photography's finest documents of a time and place." 
</P>
<P>
Vishniac's works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress 
in Washington and the Jewish Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Another book of photographs of Jewish life is still to be published, said his 
daughter, Mara Kohn of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He also is survived by his wife, Edith, four grandchildren and five 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said in a statement: 
"He was a visionary who understood that what his lens captured in pre-World War 
II Poland would be the last images of a vanished world. His photographs 
captured the life and soul of a people."

U.S EXTRADITES MAN ACCUSED AS WAR CRIMINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal magistrate Tuesday ordered a La Habra man extradited to West Germany, 
where he is sought on war crimes charges of murdering concentration camp 
prisoners during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Ralph J. Geffen of Los Angeles took the action after Bruno Karl 
Blach voluntarily waived his right to a formal extradition hearing -- the first 
time an accused Nazi war criminal has not fought extradition from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief hearing, the 70-year-old retired grocery clerk told the magistrate 
that he fully understood what he was doing and had not been pressured into the 
decision. Had Blach fought extradition, the U.S. government would have been 
required to show that there was probable cause that he was guilty of war 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, federal marshals turned Blach over to West German 
authorities. German officials were unavailable for comment, but Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Peter Morris, who handled the case, said Blach would be immediately flown 
to Cologne, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Blach was arrested at his La Habra home last October after a warrant was issued 
by a West German court. He has remained in custody ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant charged Blach with killing prisoners from April 2 to 14, 1945, 
while they were being led on a forced, 200-kilometer march from the Wiener 
Neudorf concentration camp in Germany to the Mauthausen camp in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Parker, Blach's lawyer, said his client had decided not to fight 
extradition because he wanted to go back to West Germany to face the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"He has told me he is not guilty," the Fullerton attorney said. "He was a 
private first class; he gave no orders." 
</P>
<P>
When Blach was arrested last fall, Parker acknowledged that his client had been 
on the 1945 march but Blach denied killing anyone. 
</P>
<P>
However, documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles said the West German 
government has testimony from eyewitnesses about murders Blach committed during 
the march. 
</P>
<P>
Blach's decision not to fight extradition, reached in the last few days, ended 
a lengthy struggle to stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When accusations about his past surfaced several years ago, the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation proceedings on grounds 
that Blach had entered the country illegally. He had been living quietly in the 
United States since 1956 under his own name. 
</P>
<P>
Blach was ordered deported in 1987 after an emotionally charged hearing in 
which a concentration camp survivor identified him as a Nazi guard who 
allegedly machine-gunned to death an elderly Polish Jew in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness, Aleksy Bialas, a retired soil engineer living in Canada, 
tearfully testified that the guard shot the enfeebled man when he was having 
difficulty walking on the forced march between the two concentration camps. 
Bialas testified that Blach threw the man into a ditch before shooting him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him (the victim in the ditch)," Bialas said. "I can't ever forget. The 
old chap was looking at me when he died." 
</P>
<P>
A federal immigration judge said he found Bialas' testimony "credible, 
convincing and persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
Blach appealed the deportation order, and the appeal was pending when West 
German authorities filed criminal charges against him last June and asked the 
United States to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas gave a statement to West German authorities, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two other witnesses have told West German authorities that Blach 
shot and killed an unidentified young Yugolsav prisoner who had fallen from 
exhaustion during the march, as well as another prisoner of unknown origin, 
according to documents filed in the case here. The West German warrant states 
that "well over 100 of the prisoners" on the march were killed by the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Blach, a native of Czechoslovakia, joined the Nazi Party in January, 1939, 
according to the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, 
the unit that has sought out Nazi war criminals in the United States. In 1940, 
U.S. officials claim, Blach joined the Waffen-SS unit and was assigned to the 
SS Totenkopf (Death's Head Battalion) at Dachau in Germany. He served there 
until the middle of 1943, when he transferred to Wiener-Neudorf near Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Parker contended that Blach is still a citizen of Czechoslovakia, but he 
acknowledged that Blach possesses a West German passport. 
</P>
<P>
Blach is the fourth alleged Nazi war criminal extradited by the United States 
since the end of World War II. U.S. officials identified the others as: 
</P>
<P>
* Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan of Queens, N.Y., a former concentration camp guard, 
who was extradited to West Germany in 1973. She was sentenced in 1980 to life 
imprisonment, which she is serving for multiple counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
* Andrija Artukovic of Surfside, Calif., the former interior minister of the 
Nazi puppet state of Croatia, who was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1986. He was 
convicted of mass murder, sentenced to death and died in prison in 1988 while 
an appeal for clemency was pending. 
</P>
<P>
* John Demanjuk of Cleveland, who was extradited to Israel in 1986. He was 
convicted in 1988 of mass murder at the gas chambers of the Treblinka 
concentration camp in Poland and was sentenced to death. His appeal is pending 
in Israel.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER'S CAR IS TARGET OF SHOOTING ON 
FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police Tuesday were seeking a gunman and two accomplices who fired 
several shots at an off-duty officer's car, injuring one of his passengers and 
forcing a temporary closure of the southbound Harbor Freeway just after the 
Monday evening rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger, who was not identified, was treated for a forehead cut and 
released, Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Chuck Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the officer nor the second passenger was injured. They were not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the incident began about 8 p.m. Monday on the freeway near 83rd 
Street, when three men in a Datsun sped up along the left side of the officer's 
personal car. One man "fired several rounds at the officer's vehicle," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shots peppered the officer's car, resulting in a passenger being cut by a metal 
fragment. The freeway was closed until 10:30 p.m. while police gathered 
evidence. Police say they have found no motive for the shooting.

<P>
A 7-year-old boy was killed, his mother seriously hurt and four other children 
either critically or seriously injured Tuesday when an alleged drunk driver 
plowed his car into a crowd of children in Florence, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose name was not released, allegedly drove over a curb in the

in and around a fenced-in front yard, said Sgt. Craig Boyett. 
</P>
<P>
Only the name of the dead boy, Pedro Hernandez, was released. A 33-year-old 
woman identified as his mother received serious chest injuries. The victims 
were taken to several area hospitals, County firefighter Leo Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old driver, apprehended by witnesses when he tried to bolt from the 
car, was booked in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center, Boyett said.

BILL BOYARSKY: FLORES AND FERRARO AS A HIT SQUAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You could admire the skill of the assassins and still be appalled by the 
result, after the Los Angeles City Council killed public financing of political 
campaigns the other day. 
</P>
<P>
This was an inside job, accomplished by two skilled insiders, Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores and her accomplice, Council President John Ferraro. Seldom has a 
City Hall political hit been administered with such speed and surprise -- and 
by such a deceptively nice trigger person as Councilwoman Flores. And few 
accomplices can spin an alibi as well as Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were outsiders, the citizen members of a commission appointed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley to recommend new ethical standards for local government. In 
its final report, the commission urged publicly financed election campaigns in 
order to curb the influence of big campaign contributors and proposed tougher 
conflict-of-interest rules. 
</P>
<P>
The commission ended its work with high hopes. "A historic moment in the life 
of the city," said Rabbi Allen A. Freehling, a member of the group, on the day 
the commission announced its proposals. But to the council, if this was 
history, it was a bad chapter. A number of council members resented a 
commission they felt was composed of do-gooders from the outside, trying to 
shackle the lawmakers with an unrealistic set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
The moment of truth came on Friday as the council was debating the commission's 
proposals, now in the form of a recommended city ordinance. Few suspected 
Flores was the agent of the insiders' revenge when she began to speak. But she 
had a plan. Before she finished, Flores had proposed, and pushed through, an 
amendment that eliminated the provision for taxpayer-financed campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics ordinance plan would still create a new government agency to enforce 
conflict-of-interest and campaign finance laws. But with public financing 
removed and other provisions weakened, the proposal is not much like the plan 
proposed by the citizens commission. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, as revised by the council, will be placed on the June ballot if 
the council votes final approval as expected next month. Accompanying it will 
be a proposal to raise the pay of council members, the mayor, the city attorney 
and the city controller. 
</P>
<P>
It was well into the third day of an unfocused debate on the ethics package 
when Flores spoke. The night before, she had her staff prepare an amendment 
that would wipe out publicly financed campaigns. But she didn't know whether 
she would introduce it. "I had it in the back of my mind as a play that might 
work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was also aware of the animosity several council members felt toward 
Geoffrey Cowan, who heads the citizens commission, and attorney Bob Stern, who 
was testifying on behalf of its report. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's hostility was especially visible. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, the council president had appeared at a press conference with 
Cowan and had promised to vote to put the campaign finance plan on the ballot. 
But on this morning, Ferraro had lectured Cowan and Stern, calling their 
reforms impractical and potentially harmful. "As I listened to Ferraro, he 
seemed to be losing his zeal," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
That was crucial to the vote count. As the morning began, it looked like Flores 
might be one vote short of the eight needed for approval of her amendment on 
the 15-member council. She needed Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
Not a word was exchanged between the two. But when it came time to vote, 
Ferraro backed Flores and she won. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, reporters demanded to know why Ferraro switched. At times like 
this, Ferraro, an All-American lineman for USC, assumes the pose of the 
stereotypical dumb jock. His expression totally innocent -- but with telltale 
signs of humor around his eyes -- Ferraro gave his alibi. He had made a 
mistake. He thought the main vote on campaign finance would come up later. 
</P>
<P>
That's hard to believe. Ferraro is the council's ultimate insider. Very little 
surprises him. He doesn't make mistakes on matters as important as this. That's 
why he's president. 
</P>
<P>
It was a slick move and the beauty of it was that nothing had to be said. 
Flores and Ferraro were teammates who have played the game together for years. 
She knew, without being told, that Ferraro was ready to abandon the reformers. 
It's proof that the best deals in politics are not put in writing, or even 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, was it appalling? 
</P>
<P>
Because the council needs reform. All through the debate, most council members 
admitted this. But the majority didn't seem to understand that the world 
outside City Hall knows it too. 
</P>
<P>
Studied alone, as if it were a museum piece, Flores' maneuver was a success. 
But viewed in the context of a city government overly influenced by campaign 
contributors, it merely showed that the insiders' vision doesn't extend beyond 
the City Hall steps.

L.A.'S HOBOS ARE FORCED TO HIT THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF A NEW CLUBHOUSE 
</P>

Santa Fe Bo and Capt. Cook did what comes naturally Tuesday night when the Hobo 
Club shut its doors in Los Angeles for the last time. They hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
The two tramps helped "decommission" their Westside meeting place and lead a 
farewell hobo survival workshop for club members. Then they set out to find a 
new home for the 3,000-member National Hobo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A developer plans to erect an office building on the site of the 45-year-old 
Century City Tavern &amp; Restaurant, a small Santa Monica Boulevard eatery 
that has served as the group's clubhouse for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a new place in this area," said Santa Fe Bo, who started the 
hobo association 13 years ago. "But we've been looking for a year," added Capt. 
Cook, a director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's survival workshop was appropriate. Owners of other Westside 
establishments haven't exactly lined up to turn their trendy places into a new 
hobo headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the estimated 600 association members in the Los Angeles area are 
hardly scruffy transients who hop the rails for a free ride between handouts. 
They feel right at home in the shadow of Century City high-rises that are 65 
miles from the closest real "hobo jungle" -- near the Southern Pacific rail 
yard in Colton in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, Santa Fe Bo is Bobb Hopkins, 41, an actor from Woodland Hills, 
who said he got hooked on hoboing on an eight-day rail ride to Boston in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Cook is the road name of Garth Bishop, 50, a Los Angeles book publisher, 
who said he first sneaked aboard a freight train as an Arkansas teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Other dues-paying members of the association include doctors, lawyers and 
corporate executives who have adopted such rail-riding monikers as Itchy Foot, 
Middle Caboose Mark and Hopalong Chet. 
</P>
<P>
The yuppie hobos say they like to change pace by occasionally climbing into 
jeans and work shirts and venturing out to Colton to hop slow-moving freights. 
</P>
<P>
Besides experiencing a genuinely American form of folklore, riding the rails 
provides an unparalleled rush of excitement, according to the self-styled 'bos. 
</P>
<P>
There's the danger of jumping aboard a moving train, the joy of watching the 
scenery slide past an open boxcar door and the thrill of outsmarting railroad 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"You see how real people live," said Beverly Hills hobo Tudor Williams, 46, who 
hitches a train ride whenever he can take time off from his job as private chef 
for a Hollywood producer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is known to other hobos as Wandering Wills, cooked up 33 quarts 
each of mulligan stew and hobo chili for Tuesday night's farewell. 
</P>
<P>
The hobos bemoaned the loss of their meeting place as they stood in the stew 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"This is home sweet home to me," said Michael Followell, 30, a heavy-equipment 
operator from Texas, who says he travels 10,000 miles a year on the rails. 
</P>
<P>
Occasional hobo Mark Stevenson, 35, came straight from work as a commercial 
banker. He took off his coat and tie as he entered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible," the West Adams district resident said. "We've got to find a 
new location soon. I'm going to do my best to find that place." 
</P>
<P>
Hobo survival tips shared with club members Tuesday night were for the 1990s, 
not the '30s, when the Depression made tramps out of thousands of Americans who 
rode the rails in search of better lives. 
</P>
<P>
They included suggestions that bedrolls include current railroad maps and at 
least two valid pieces of identification. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owner Voja Vlatkovic, a 56-year-old former Olympic track star from 
Yugoslavia, said he didn't know what a hobo was when club members first began 
meeting at his place. The location was picked for meetings because both Hopkins 
and Bishop lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Vlatkovic said he will miss the hobos but, he confessed, "I travel by plane."

TORRES OPTS FOR 'INSECTS OVER POISON,' UNVEILS 2 ANTI-MALATHION BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The first major political attack against the state's policy of aerial pesticide 
spraying to control the Medfly was launched in Los Angeles Tuesday by state 
Sen. Art Torres, who introduced two bills that would bring an immediate halt to 
the use of malathion in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' bills, which will almost certainly face stiff opposition from the 
influential agriculture lobby, were presented at a rally at Huntington Drive 
Elementary School, where 100 supporters cheered as the Los Angeles Democrat 
lambasted Republican Gov. George Deukmejian and other state officials for their 
"incompetence" and "senseless" backing of aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitude has been spray today and ask questions later," Torres said. 
"This repeated spraying is simply unacceptable. . . . Toxic chemicals should 
not be part of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
The bills would ban repeated aerial pesticide spraying and require proof from 
state agencies, in the form of detailed studies and assessments, that any 
pesticide used will be effective in eradicating the Medfly and not endanger the 
public or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the measures would effectively stop the state's current aerial 
spraying program, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The bills also call for a full environmental review of any future state 
eradication efforts, public notice before any pesticide application and an 
ongoing health monitoring program. 
</P>
<P>
State health and agriculture officials have maintained that malathion spraying 
is one of the safest and most effective ways to wipe out the pesky 
Mediterranean fruit fly, which has infested 372 square miles of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres said continuing questions about the pesticide's safety from the 
public demand an end to spraying, even if it means living with the Medfly 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with insects over poison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the spraying cheered the measures as a sign of the building 
political momentum to stop the aerial assault against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great; he's taken a stand where so far no one else has," said 
Michael Bell, a coordinator of the citizens group, Safe Alternatives to Fruit 
Fly Eradication (SAFE). "It better pass." 
</P>
<P>
But Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said the bills are simply "political rhetoric" aimed at placating 
voters and not dealing rationally or scientifically with the current 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, who is in charge of the eradication effort, said malathion is safe in 
the minute doses used and is by far the most effective means of destroying the 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
If the state were prohibited from using the pesticide, the current infestation 
could blossom into a statewide disaster that could cost billions of dollars in 
crop damage and lost jobs, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It will present an extreme danger to the fruit industry and the California 
environment," Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that, if urban spraying is stopped, more pesticides, not less, will 
have to be used on crops in rural areas to stop the fly. 
</P>
<P>
The bills also face a formidable challenge in the Legislature that may make the 
measures nothing more than wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Durando, president of the Fresno-based California Grape and Tree Fruit 
League, promised an aggressive campaign by growers to stop the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way it is going to get through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An example of agriculture's might is a bill rural legislators pushed through in 
1985 that scrapped environmental impact reports on all pesticide spraying and 
limited legal challenges to aerial spraying programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), chairman of the state Senate Agriculture Committee, 
also predicted tough going for Torres' bills. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation "as extreme as this isn't going to make it through," he said. 
"Let's face it. Even if they cleared both houses, the governor would just 
veto." 
</P>
<P>
Torres agreed the bills face an uphill battle, but he said he believed the 
political tide is beginning to turn against the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have been held for the last two weeks in Los Angeles County, and 
a growing number of cities -- such as Norwalk, Monterey Park, Huntington Beach 
and Garden Grove -- have passed resolutions denouncing the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said it will probably take about two months for the bills' fate to be 
decided. The bills are being submitted as emergency measures that would allow 
them to be implemented immediately if approved.

CAST OF 'CHEERS' LEADS WESTWOOD PROTEST AGAINST MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Barflies met Medflies on Tuesday, as the cast of the long-running television 
series "Cheers" led a Westwood protest against continued aerial spraying of the 
controversial pesticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three children and I'm very careful about what I feed them, yet I have 
absolutely no control over this stuff being dropped on our heads," said Rhea 
Perlman, who plays a wise-cracking waitress on the NBC situation comedy, which 
takes place in a mythical Boston tavern. "I feel like it's something the 
citizens of Los Angeles should have a say in." 
</P>
<P>
In all, some 80 protesters, many wearing breathing masks or carrying signs 
reading "Honk If You Hate Malathion," participated in the noontime rally 
outside the Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a mushrooming series of protests against the state-ordered 
government spraying program that began late last year to eradicate the most 
recent Mediterranean fruit fly infestation that affects 372 square miles in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the most star-studded anti-pesticide rally this year, as the six 
cast members made a 45-minute appearance before hustling off in a van to 
Hollywood -- as fellow protesters applauded -- in order to film a new episode 
of "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"We only had them for about half an hour," explained Doretta Zemp, whose 
Coalition Against Malathion organized the protest. "They have a 12 o'clock 
shoot today." 
</P>
<P>
Zemp then led the remaining demonstrators in a sing-along protest to the tune 
of "Frere Jacques": 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion. Malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fills the air. Fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Babies sick and crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor is lying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you care. Save the air." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The protesters, most garbed in red to "signify danger," proceeded to march into 
Westwood Village to be filmed themselves for the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some demonstrations attended by Hollywood celebrities in which the 
issues may have little impact on their lives, pesticide spraying has a direct 
bearing on members of the environmentally conscious "Cheers" cast, the actors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got two babies at home and when I'm told I should cover the playground 
equipment and the sandbox . . . I've got to start thinking -- why?" said John 
Ratzenberger, who portrays Cliff the mailman. "This (demonstration) helps me to 
vent my spleen, certainly. And I'll do whatever it takes for my voice to be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a steamfitter I'd still be here." 
</P>
<P>
The show's star, Ted Danson, founder of the American Oceans Campaign 
environmental organization, said common sense tells him that "every time you 
use a pesticide, it ends up getting in the water system." 
</P>
<P>
Danson acknowledged, however, that he still is trying to learn more about 
malathion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really here to make a huge statement here today. I'm here to educate 
myself," he said. "(But) something does not feel right. You have to admit it's 
a little strange that you have to run out and cover your pools and your 
sandboxes and tape your windows. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Unless we jump up and down and say, 'wait, wait, toxics are not the 
answer,' then no one is going to look for a safer answer," Danson continued. 
"They're going to look for the most expedient, cheapest way for them to 
accomplish their goals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of human nature."

MORATORIUM SOUGHT ON DEMOLITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: YAROSLAVSKY EXPRESSES OUTRAGE OVER DESTRUCTION OF REPAIRABLE HOMES IN 
ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM. BRADLEY PROPOSES SOME REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on Tuesday called for a 60-day moratorium on 
city-ordered demolitions of abandoned homes, and Mayor Tom Bradley proposed 
other restrictions, based upon a published report that an aggressive new 
anti-drug tear-down program had destroyed salvageable houses. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said Operation Knockdown was billed a year ago as a "last resort" 
to rid neighborhoods of crack cocaine houses, but "this program has gone far 
beyond that," resulting in the demolition of homes in poor areas with acute 
housing shortages, regardless of whether drugs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Times disclosed Tuesday that the program, intended to destroy about 70 
derelict homes used as crack dens and gang hide-outs, had quietly expanded as 
city Building and Safety inspectors received mounting complaints from police 
and neighbors concerning dilapidated or crime-ridden houses. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 215 homes and other buildings -- including an unknown number of 
repairable houses -- were bulldozed at a cost to the owners of $2,500 to $4,500 
each. Some houses had been used by homeless squatters who were then put on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, city officials were unable to provide a figure -- and said they were 
not keeping track -- of how many homes were actually known crack houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was outraged," Yaroslavsky said. "(Elected officials) have actually gone 
down with press agents in hand to watch demolitions. Demolishing of homes is 
nothing to celebrate in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in a letter to The Times, called Operation Knockdown a program that 
"has worked," but he proposed two reforms. He asked for more certification 
showing that homes are not repairable before they are destroyed, and proposed 
that owners be told of loans that may be available to repair their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Only if a property is in serious disrepair -- with open windows and doors and 
roofs that have been burned down by fire -- should Building and Safety activate 
Operation Knockdown," Bradley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky, whose motion will be considered by the City Council next 
Tuesday, said that even if a home is "really dilapidated," the city should 
attempt to resolve the problem without demolition. "The big picture is that we 
have the worst homelessness anywhere," Yaroslavsky said. "We are always quick 
to criticize the Bush Administration or Reagan Administration for causing 
homelessness but don't . . . blame ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, an aide to Bradley, said the mayor ordered Building and Safety 
officials last week to undertake the changes proposed in his letter. He said 
the changes were ordered after a Times reporter asked the mayor for comment on 
the newspaper's findings. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said the majority of homes torn down could not have 
been fixed, but he was unable to provide statistics. Building and Safety 
officials earlier told The Times that they were not keeping a tally. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Bradley opposes Yaroslavsky's motion for a moratorium, believing 
"that people who live near these crack homes don't deserve to live near them 
even one more day, and certainly not 60 more days."

WHY ADD TO THE HOUSING SHORTAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen months ago the Los Angeles City Council, confronted with a rising 
problem of abandoned homes serving as crack houses, passed an ordinance 
allowing the city to demolish uninhabitable properties without delay. That 
prompted Mayor Bradley to launch Operation Knockdown, which took dead aim at 
derelict buildings that served as havens for drug users and street gangs. While 
the goal of the program -- to rid orderly neighborhoods of dangerous 
nuisances-was well-intentioned, the policy has been applied too broadly. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, according to Times writer Jill Stewart, Operation 
Knockdown has resulted, directly or indirectly, in the loss of more than 215 
houses. More than 50 houses, primarily in the poor neighborhoods of 
South-Central Los Angeles, were bulldozed by the city. And more than 150 houses 
were leveled with the consent of the owners, who, lacking either the will or 
the money to make substantial repairs, paid for the demolition to get rid of 
their problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the good intentions, this scorched-earth policy comes at the wrong 
time. The region faces a severe housing crisis. Public policy should encourage 
housing preservation, not demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Demolition is warranted only in extreme situations. The ordinance targets crack 
houses, but the city is also bulldozing ramshackle, unsecured and rat-infested 
houses in need of major repair. Some of that housing -- including abandoned 
houses where homeless people congregate -- should be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
In response to The Times article, Mayor Bradley, in a letter to the editor 
published today, has instructed the Department of Building and Safety to "take 
extra steps" to make absolutely certain that any candidate for demolition is 
utterly and hopelessly beyond repair. He has also directed the city to provide 
information on housing rehabilitation grants to owners who want to save their 
houses. And the mayor has instructed the city's new housing coordinator, 
Michael Bodaken, to conduct a complete review of Operation Knockdown, as well 
as to make new proposals for constructing affordable housing on city-owned 
vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's moves are most welcome. So would be a temporary halt to all 
bulldozing. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has proposed one for 60 days. Good idea. 
A moratorium would give the city time to come up with some answers to such 
questions as: What is the impact of Operation Knockdown on affordable housing 
and homelessness? What are the alternatives? Housing should be torn down only 
as a last resort.

OPERATION KNOCKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great concern your story "Home Knockdowns Roust More Than Drug 
Dealers" (Part A, Jan. 23). Operation Knockdown was initiated to free 
neighborhoods from homes that are public safety hazards, and that often serve 
as dens for drug dealers and gang members. No innocent homeowner should be 
forced to live side-by-side to a derelict, abandoned building such as the ones 
targeted by the knockdown program. 
</P>
<P>
Only if a property is in serious disrepair -- with open windows and doors and 
roofs that have been burned down by fire -- should the Department of Building 
and Safety activate Operation Knockdown. The program has worked. Throughout 
this city, we have removed dangerous structures from law-abiding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as part of my review of the anti-gang, anti-drug knockdown program, 
I ordered that the following three actions take place: 
</P>
<P>
1) The Department of Building and Safety should take extra steps to certify 
these homes designated for knockdown cannot be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
2) Information regarding housing-rehabilitation grants through the Community 
Development Department and Community Redevelopment Agency must be made 
available to homeowners through the program who wish to save their homes. 
</P>
<P>
3) My recently appointed housing coordinator, Michael Bodaken, will undertake a 
review of the entire program to ensure that it meets these tough, 
well-intentioned goals. In particular, Bodaken will review how vacant lots may 
be used to construct affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Knockdown is an important tool for the city to wake up property 
owners to the fact that abandoned, derelict buildings can often serve as 
breeding grounds for crime. If an owner neglects a property, the city has legal 
authority to hold the owner responsible. And we will take that action to 
protect our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
However, I don't want to see this program catch those property owners who are 
making a good-faith effort to improve their building in the middle. The city 
will make loan information and other rehabilitation tools available to any 
property owner who shares our goal of improving the quality of life for those 
living in inner-city neighborhoods.

With regard to the editorial "Gorbachev's Secession Crisis" (Jan. 16), I should 
like to comment on what was not mentioned in the editorial: namely on the 
identity crisis now facing the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear to me, as an American of Lithuanian descent, that the residents of 
Sovietized countries must feel strongly about the loss of their national 
identity in such a process. 
</P>
<P>
Just how Soviet officials react to the current upsurge of nationalism remains 
to be seen. The fact that many of the Baltic and Armenian "rebels" seen in the 
press are relatively young men and women is significant. They were not around 
when their countries became republics but they probably heard stories of the 
good, old days from their elders. 
</P>
<P>
What is evident is that many residents of what is called Vilnius, a city of the 
Soviet Union, feel that the original name of that age-old city should be 
restored and made the capital of Lithuania. I consider Vilnius to be Vilna, and 
I suspect that present-day Lithuanians may feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
There is no comparison between the Sovietization of established nations into 
the structure of a republic and the unification of states in our country. Each 
American state still retains its individual traditions, customs and practices. 
We did not change place names in the states as the result of the Civil War. The 
same cannot be said about the Soviets.

TIBET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your coverage of the recent lifting of martial law in Beijing, China, you 
neglected to mention that martial law (harsher than what had existed in 
Beijing) is still in effect in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Along with martial law, Tibetans are also suffering with a system of pass laws 
-- which even South Africa has abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Martial law and the pass laws are beginning to psychologically scar Tibetan 
children and add to the general atmosphere of fear and repression. All of this 
goes on with little news coverage or public protest here. 
</P>
<P>
The government's policy of transferring ethnic Chinese to Tibet is making 
Tibetans an insignificant minority in their own land. This genocide continues 
quietly and virtually unreported in the American press. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy and irony of this is all the greater when one recalls that the 
Dalai Lama of Tibet received the Nobel Peace Prize a mere three months ago.

<P>
HAITI: IT IS A MEASURE OF THE NATION'S DEGRADATION THAT NOW IT MUST HOPE FOR 
ANOTHER MILITARY COUP TO DUMP A DICTATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By AMY WILENTZ, Amy Wilentz is author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier 
(Simon and Schuster, 1989). She has just returned to Haiti.

<TEXT>
<P>
A week before the latest round of arrests and beatings began in Haiti, 
mountains of human excrement were built in front of the offices of various 
political leaders and democratic organizations, and the stuff was splattered on 
and into the buildings. It was no doubt the army that erected these fitting 
monuments to itself; only the military and the police -- and the municipal 
workers at their beck and call -- have access to so much of this particular 
material and the means to transport it. "You are excrement," the army was 
saying to the democratic movement. "You are our target." The next day, a 
journalist who made broadcast fun of the tactic was assassinated. On the 
streets, graffiti no doubt written by members of that same army began to 
appear: "Avril for Five Years." The excrement had hit the fan, and the writing 
was on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
So much had already happened that Haitians were unsurprised by the latest 
developments. Since he took power in September, 1988, Gen. Prosper Avril has 
made it clear that he is an astute disciple of his mentor, the dictator 
Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. Haitians feared from the first day that Avril 
would never voluntarily leave the presidency and that he had no interest in the 
democratic election he had scheduled for October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and the mainstream American media, however, exhibited no 
such insight. Instead of mistrusting the general, they treated him like a 
prince of peace. Pledges made by Avril to "lead Haiti down the irreversible 
path to democracy" were received with embarrassing acceptance by the State 
Department and Congress, which slowly began to release economic aid funds to 
his government. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it was pleased at the lack of violence under Avril's 
regime. Indeed, the nation looked calm from the outside, in contrast to the 
flagrantly bloody rule of his predecessor, Gen. Henri Namphy. 
</P>
<P>
Avril silenced dissent. While the American media all but ignored the situation 
and the U.S. Embassy tried to avert its eyes, paramilitary units roamed Haitian 
cities and the countryside, attacking with impunity church organizers, members 
of peasant movements, youth groups and democratic political parties. 
Journalists were threatened with ugly fates, including death. Using the 
divide-and-conquer tactics of Papa Doc, Avril also subjugated the army to his 
will. He took the wheel of the military and plowed through the democratic 
movement like a tank, using the tried-and-true tools of torture, imprisonment 
and nighttime execution. 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the world failed to react, Avril became more violent, less 
worried about international repercussions. He could, he discovered, attack the 
popular movements at will and the international community would not blink. He 
had leaders of popular democratic organizations -- like the nation's largest 
labor federation -- beaten, then displayed in bloodied bandages on state-run 
television, with virtually no coverage by the American news media. He 
dismantled in months what it had taken the Haitian people three years to build: 
the rudimentary structures of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The last few days have been a rude awakening for the U.S. government, which 
pursued with Avril the same ill-considered policy that it had used ever since 
Papa Doc took over the presidency in 1957: Support the man in power, no matter 
what breed of monster he may be. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Avril widened his scope, arresting the moderate and right-wing 
elements of the democratic opposition, at least one of them a probable 
candidate in the presidential election. Many were severely beaten. Some were 
then exiled, in direct contravention of the immensely popular 1987 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with Haiti's right and center under attack, the State Department took 
notice and issued an almost tough-minded statement condemning Avril's actions. 
Of course, by now it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
For most of us who know Haiti, the last months have been a nightmare of deja 
vu, like a book of days from the reign of Papa Doc. By now, everyone who could 
have planted the seeds of a new polity is dead or in prison or in hiding or in 
exile. All of the promise of the 1986 overthrow of the Duvalier dynasty has 
been exhausted in a sad, long struggle against a series of unpredictable 
dictators who actually represent the entrenched status quo. Three leaders of 
the democratic opposition -- all men in their 30s, part of Haiti's future -- 
have been incarcerated since November. Radio stations once considered beacons 
of free speech are playing only music. 
</P>
<P>
One small possibility remains for Haiti. If he continues on his irreversible 
path to dictatorship, Avril may find himself cut off from all financial support 
from the United States and other donor nations. When economies crumble, armies 
grow restless. There are already rumors of fissures within the military. 
Perhaps a few months of penury will lead to a coup. After all, there have been 
three coups during the four years since Jean-Claude Duvalier fell. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of Haiti's degradation that democrats who once aspired to a new 
world must now pin their hopes on the vagaries of military malcontents. But as 
the emptiness of the policies of the last few years becomes apparent, perhaps 
the Haitian people will once again gather up their courage and demand better.

MODERN AMERICAN CHURCH NEEDS NO SCARLET LETTER; 
</P>
<P>
LUTHERANS: THE ORDINATION OF PRACTICING HOMOSEXUALS HAS BEEN MET WITH AN 
INTOLERANCE THAT IGNORES THE ROLE RELIGION MUST PLAY IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL LINDSTROM LUEDTKE, Carol Lindstrom Luedtke teaches American literature 
at Westridge School and English at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is disturbed by the ordination in 
San Francisco last week of a lesbian couple and a gay man who will not vow 
celibacy. No institution should shrink from controversy and the church is no 
exception. Martin Luther's 95 Theses in 1517 marking the beginning of German 
Protestantism were greeted with neither mildness nor acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
What is peculiar is that in a church body traditionally and primarily regulated 
by elected, ordained pastors, there is widespread concern among the laity on 
this issue. Martin Marty, foremost American church historian and a Lutheran 
himself, suggests that the majority of Lutheran laity side with the official 
church policy -- that practicing homosexuals should not be ordained. 
</P>
<P>
The basis for the policy is that sexual activity should be permitted only 
within the traditional marriage bond of women and men. Biblical admonitions are 
found in Leviticus in the Old Testament and in Paul's condemnation of 
homosexuality in the New Testament. The fact that most contemporary 
parishioners agree with the current policy is not surprising, since the 
Lutheran Church in the United States has been characterized and influenced by 
the conservatism of Northern European immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But the church's views reflect pervasive and intolerant social mores. Social 
judgment and hypocrisy of the kind that Nathaniel Hawthorne described in "The 
Scarlet Letter" -- centered around a Puritan community that rejected an 
otherwise heroic woman for her single act of adultery -- need to be recognized 
and avoided by the modern church. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in my lifetime, the church's code of behavior has become less 
judgmental and more accepting. I grew up in a Lutheran parsonage and recall 
when I could not attend a theologically innocuous Ma and Pa Kettle movie on 
Sundays and had to remove my colored nail polish for the sabbath. I also 
remember -- only 15 years ago -- a Midwestern woman of the Missouri Synod 
stating that she was showing disrespect to God by not wearing a hat to 
services. More significant is the example of a Lutheran pastor 30 years ago who 
was defrocked and disallowed from serving in any type of parish role because he 
was divorced. Today, such "improprieties" are overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
But how long will it take for the church to accept practicing homosexuals among 
its clergy? 
</P>
<P>
While its people move -- too slowly -- toward greater tolerance, the 
fundamental beliefs of love and brotherhood that the church espouses are 
diluted and become less credible. When this wrenching controversy within the 
church is resolved, the church can become a stronger force in the world. Here 
is an occasion where people can resist harsh and narrow judgment and accept 
clergy no matter what their human sexual practices. The church needs to return 
to more important concerns of salvation and redemption. 
</P>
<P>
The ordination of practicing homosexuals is not an issue of good and evil, or 
really a fundamental theological concern at all. It is an issue of individual 
choice and social acceptance, a point most Lutherans refuse to acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
What the Evangelical Luthern Church in America -- and all Christians -- should 
practice is the Greek ideal of koinonia -- unequivocal love of God and fellow 
humans. If the church is going to flourish and survive in a modern world, 
authentic love needs to extend beyond the bounds of current social mores. That 
love is inclusive, unrestricted, tolerant and generous.

DOLE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Buchanan's Op-Ed piece, "Bob Dole's Proposal Is Half a Right Idea" (Jan. 
21), has some merit. I can see no need for foreign aid, certainly for people 
who consistently oppose us in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
However, Israel is a special case. The defense aid we give to Denmark, Belgium 
and West Germany, to the tune of $139 billion, is earmarked for defense. The 
comparable defense aid for Israel, serving the same purpose in the Middle East 
as it does in Western Europe, would cost some $59 billion if not for Israel, a 
cost Israel underwrites, receiving a modest $3 billion from us. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East that maintains U.S. influence 
against the Soviet and Arab totalitarians. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Buchanan is right. It is time we put America first and didn't send aid to 
people who inherently hate America and democracy. Let's help our friends and 
hinder our enemies.

Mobil Corp.: The energy firm's 1989 net income fell 13% from a year earlier to 
$1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue increased 4% to $56.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, the firm earned 
$447 million, down 3%. Revenue declined 13% to $15.1 billion. The New York firm 
said higher domestic profit from increased crude oil prices was partly offset 
by lower natural gas prices, lower production of liquid hydrocarbons because of 
an asset sales program and lower chemical earnings as worldwide petrochemical 
prices fell. The 1989 results also include a $40-million provision for 
restructuring and $36 million in writeoffs.

They Got the Beat -- Again: The Go-Go's are reuniting, at least for one 
performance. The five members of the Los Angeles all-female rock band are 
holding a press conference (along with Jane Fonda) Thursday at the Bel Age 
Hotel in West Hollywood to announce that they'll play March 28 at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, headlining a benefit concert for the California Environmental 
Protection Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
No other Go-Go's projects are planned at this time. The group, which in 1982 
hit No. 1 with the debut "Beauty and the Beat" album and No. 2 with the song 
"We Got the Beat," broke up in 1985. All five have pursued other musical 
endeavors, though only lead singer Belinda Carlisle has had consistent chart 
success. Claudia Puig

Happiness Is a Warm Petit Chien: Cartoonist Charles Schulz drew lofty praise 
from the keepers of French culture Tuesday as they lavishly celebrated the 40th 
birthday of America's favorite floppy-eared dog, the irrepressible Snoopy. The 
beagle was glorified with a giant retrospective at the Decorative Arts Museum 
in the northern wing of the Louvre complex. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which features 300 stuffed Snoopies dressed by the world's leading 
fashion designers and original "Peanuts" drawings, opened to the public today 
and runs through April 22. French Culture Minister Jack Lang named Schulz a 
Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest awards for excellence in 
the arts. Lang told Schulz, "Your character is both mythical and hedonistic and 
he has taken over our collective consciousness and become a part of our 
everyday lives." Negotiations are under way to bring the exhibit to the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Claudia Puig

CARL HALVORSON MAKES DEBUT IN GOLD MEDAL SERIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
High promise is usually the most one can expect from the young artists 
presented annually on the Gold Medal series at the Ambassador Auditorium. 
Strong achievement sometimes materializes, too, and that is a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Halvorson, a 28-year-old American tenor, showed both qualities in his 
debut appearance at the Pasadena hall this week. With deeper concert 
experience, a bit of loosening up in his stage manner and an infusion of 
italianita in his vocalism, Halvorson could be a valuable singer. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, and as assisted most handsomely by pianist Brent McMunn on 
Monday night, the tall singer makes a strong visual impression and offers 
accomplished, if not consistently pointed, performances. In a generous 
anthology-recital encompassing 26 songs and arias by 13 composers, he gathered 
together a number of pertinent musical and textual details. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Halvorson's achievement is admirable. If he did not delve into all the 
many artistic possibilities of every item on his program, he made a few of them 
special. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the performance, he delineated the longer line and intense 
lyricism of Purcell's "Music for a While," and savored the words in two 
folk-song arrangements by Benjamin Britten. Later, he caressed the poetry in 
Rachmaninoff's "A Passing Breeze" (sung in Russian, of course) and gave Brahms 
his due in both "Wir wandelten" and "Standchen"." 
</P>
<P>
And, in his closing group of American songs -- by Bolcom and Gershwin, among 
others -- he delivered words, rhythms and humor most pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
What Halvorson's sizable and attractive voice lacks seems to be a middle with a 
bite; as an interpreter, the tenor also fails to achieve that consistent legato 
line which is required in most of the song repertory. Yet, he handles high 
notes intelligently and successfully, keeps good control of dynamics, and 
connects thought, word and note conscientiously. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, some of the most effective moments of the evening came from McMunn, 
who proved a full partner in this sometimes meandering program, articulated 
complicated passages with ease and produced a beautiful and edgeless sound 
without underplaying. DANIEL CARIAGA

JAZZ NOTES: KUDOS FOR MULTI-REEDMAN BUDDY COLLETTE; RARE DUKE ELLINGTON FOOTAGE 
TO BE SCREENED

After more than four decades of musical contributions to the Los Angeles jazz 
community to his credit, Buddy Collette finally had his day. 
</P>
<P>
In ceremonies at the Biltmore Hotel, Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed Tuesday 
"Buddy Collette Day." Perhaps best known for his associations with Charles 
Mingus, Chico Hamilton and Gerald Wilson, Collette also received a commendation 
from the Los Angeles Jazz Society and a lifetime achievement award from the 
American Federation of Musicians, Local 47. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled. It's a boost for me, of course," was Collette's immediate 
response to the accolades. "You see and hear from all these wonderful people, 
your friends, who are out there listening, saying, 'Keep going.' Nothing could 
be better than that." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting feeling," said Collette, a multi-reedman who appears 
Saturday at the Valley Cities Jewish Community Center in Van Nuys and Feb. 2 at 
the Comeback Inn in Venice. "I never looked for this kind of thing, though, of 
course, I like to work and be appreciated for what I do. I mean, it's not that, 
'You're the greatest,' but that you've been here, doing your thing. For me, 
it's about playing, teaching, maybe making the music scene in L.A. a little 
better. It seems to belong to a lot of us from L.A. This award represents the 
struggles of people doing music for the love, not to make a buck. This is what 
make us tick." 
</P>
<P>
Previously unavailable footage of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, as well as more 
familiar films, will highlight "An Evening of Duke Ellington on Film," hosted 
by the Los Angeles chapter of the Duke Ellington Society, Friday at 8 p.m. The 
films, which will be shown at the Veterans Memorial Center, at Overland Avenue 
and Culver Boulevard, Culver City, will be culled from the archives of film 
historian Mark Cantor, who will provide commentary. Tickets, $5. Information: 
(213) 290-1291.

Percussionist-bandleader Bobby Matos is the recent recipient of Multi-Cultural 
Entry Grant from the California Arts Council. The leader of the Heritage 
Ensemble, which plays a variety of jazz-tinged Afro-Cuban music within a 
polyrhythmical context, is using his grant to produce a new LP, his group's 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about five tunes in the can and we're still working," says Matos. 
"Besides the seven core members of the band, I'm using some guest stars. Like 
yesterday, I brought in some horns, including trombonist Art Velasco, who's 
from Poncho Sanchez's band. "The thing I like about this record is that I'm the 
producer, so I'm not beholden to anyone creatively." Matos says he has several 
companies interested in distributing his project. 
</P>
<P>
Usually quite active with the Heritage Ensemble in area nightspots, Matos says 
he has been taking a break to work on scripts for "Hot Rhythm," a cable access 
show that debuts Feb. 26 on Continental Cablevision.

HILLIARD ENSEMBLE SINGS AT FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devotees of early music in Los Angeles have much to be grateful for, if only 
for the enlightened efforts of the Da Camera Society, which has brought to the 
Southland outstanding vocal ensembles including the Tallis Scholars, 
Chanticleer and on Monday, the London-based Hilliard Ensemble. This latest of 
the Society's "Historic Sites" concerts -- at First Baptist Church of Los 
Angeles -- proved stimulating for the mind, satisfying for the heart and 
nourishing for the soul. 
</P>
<P>
The program surveyed 400 years of sacred polyphony, from an anonymous example 
of 12th-Century organum to Di Lasso's profoundly affecting "Missa Pro 
Defunctis." Producing a pure, limpid sound, senza vibrato, the four singers -- 
countertenor David James, tenors Rogers Covey-Crump and Mark Padmore and 
baritone Paul Hillier -- demonstrated extraordinary dynamic control, maintained 
perfect balances and delivered the texts with uncommon sensitivity and absolute 
clarity. Intonation remained faultless, phrasing impeccable and blend sonorous. 
It is rare to hear music delivered with such precision and polish, and rarer 
still to hear it performed with such interpretive unity. TERRY McQUILKIN

GUN ISSUE DEBATED ON 'JENNINGS REPORTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What to do with the proliferation of guns and gun violence? The answer is 
somewhere; it is not, however, in "Guns," the premiere edition of "Peter 
Jennings Reporting" (tonight at 10 on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
Jennings' report isn't really after an answer. It's more of a sad lament, with 
documentation. There is Philip Glass' melancholic music and the emotional 
recollections of victims' loved ones. There is also the endless, familiar, 
insoluble debate between law enforcement experts who want gun control and 
National Rifle Assn. supporters who don't. The sad debate also centers on a 
place: Stockton, Calif., a city still full of guns and people killing with them 
a year after Patrick Purdy and his assault rifle mowed down a schoolyard 
teeming with children. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jennings, reporter, does not conceal Peter Jennings' opinions. Anti-gun 
control advocate Dale Thurston argues that criminals are deterred from armed 
homes and that armed citizens shoot more criminals than the police do, and 
Jennings, in a mildly chiding tone, immediately shoots back with 
counter-evidence. A generous section of "Guns" buttresses the gun control case 
-- guns turn merely threatening acts into murder, a gun in a home will more 
likely be used against a loved one rather than an intruder. Balance is not a 
watchword here. 
</P>
<P>
What becomes clear is that the Stockton City Council acted out of haste and 
public fear when, after the Purdy massacre, it banned assault rifles. A stark 
demonstration shows a deer rifle packing far more power than Purdy's AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
But when Stockton Mayor Barbara Fass argues that this move was "a first step," 
that elected officials had to start somewhere, there's a desperation in her 
voice. This is matched by the stunning, ersatz-libertarian paranoia of gun 
lobbyists who view government as the enemy. And in the streets, the drug 
economy and machismo ethic allow guns to multiply, causing a slow, awful 
self-immolation of America's poorer classes. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the live forum following "Guns" will transcend the near-nihilism 
that concludes Jennings' piece. "Perhaps," he utters vacuously, "Americans are 
simply willing to accept the violence." ROBERT KOEHLER

FBI SAYS SPIES WERE AT ARTS FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet spies, using the guise of stagehands at the Soviet arts festival, 
accompanied performers and tried to collect information, an FBI agent said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"KGB intelligence officers came to San Diego in connection with the arts 
festival," said FBI Special Agent Gary M. Laturno. "Their mission is to 
penetrate San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 700 Soviets who attended the 22-day festival last fall, 300 were part of 
the festival, 200 were members of the Red Army Chorus and 200 were "scientists 
or Soviet citizens," said Laturno, who would not say how many were spies with 
the KGB, which is the Soviet equivalent of the American CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the festival's hullabaloo, the agents served two purposes: They monitored 
performers to make sure none defected, and they acted as intelligence officers, 
gathering information and developing contacts, Laturno said. Some acted as 
support personnel for Soviet performers, but the performers themselves were not 
spies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are mainly interested in military technology and economic 
information or technology that would assist in developing industry and 
agriculture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no knowledge that they were successful in obtaining classified or 
embargoed technology," said Laturno, who added that he does not believe that 
agents expected to obtain information on this excursion to San Diego. Instead, 
he said, it's more likely that agents were trying to form fledgling 
relationships with residents that might one day yield valuable information. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at some of the espionage cases in the last 10 years. The Soviets are very 
patient," Laturno said. "It may take years to develop somebody before the 
person is furnishing classified information." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the festival opened Oct. 21, the FBI held a press conference to 
warn residents that spies might prowl the city, which is home to 500 Department 
of Defense contractors and one-third of the U. S. Navy. City officials groaned. 
After working feverishly to set up the festival and garner publicity, this was 
not the type of spotlight they had desired. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, the timing may not have been the best, but it fortunately 
really didn't dampen the spirits of participants or the public," said mayoral 
spokesman Paul Downey, in an interview earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The sting of the FBI officials' warnings was widespread. Some critics derided 
the agency for embracing a Cold War mentality; others said it cast a shadow 
upon international relations. Soviet press attache Sergei Aivazian, in San 
Francisco, said at the time that the FBI's edict placed "a damper on 
Soviet-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
But, for Federal Bureau of Investigation officers, the festival signaled the 
first time that Soviet officials were allowed an unrestricted visit to San 
Diego. Soviet officials are allowed in three cities: New York, Washington and 
San Francisco, where they maintain an embassy and consuls, Laturno said. Those 
officials are not permitted to travel more than 30 miles from each city, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know one-third of the officers assigned to those establishments are 
intelligence officers, and they are restricted in their travels," Laturno said. 
The festival meant that they were allowed to visit San Diego for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
And the festival will probably not be the last time -- a Soviet trade show, 
sponsored by the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the leadership of the Chamber in Moscow, you find that it is 
made up of KGB intelligence officers," Laturno said.

EL CORTEZ TO HOUSE NEW COURTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council formally completed a deal to spend $3 million in 
redevelopment funds to build nine county courtrooms in the old El Cortez Hotel 
Convention Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The council also granted developers of the site a special permit to redevelop 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, which makes final an initial agreement between the city and county 
approved by both agencies Dec. 12, requires that the nine new Superior 
courtrooms become a permanent addition to the downtown judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
Under an amended cooperation agreement, the new courts will be housed in the El 
Cortez, at 8th Avenue and Beech Street, for the next five years. After that, 
the city and county will work together to determine where the permanent 
courtrooms will go.

COURT VICTORY ON CARE FOR POOR CALLED HOLLOW; 
</P>
<P>
INDIGENT: S.D. EXPERTS SAY RULING THAT THE STATE ILLEGALLY SHIFTED CARE COSTS 
TO COUNTIES WON'T MEAN MORE FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state court has determined that California regulators illegally transferred 
costly indigent care programs to the counties in 1982, but local health-care 
experts doubt that the ruling will generate more funds for indigent care in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision on Friday, the 1st District Court of Appeal in San 
Francisco ruled that the state illegally forced counties to assume the burden 
of providing medical care that previously was included in the Medi-Cal program. 
State funding for indigent medical care in San Diego County conceivably could 
jump to $62 million from the current $41 million annually because of the 
ruling, said Paul B. Simms, deputy director of physical health services. 
</P>
<P>
But "the truth of the matter is that I don't expect" more money from the state, 
Simms said. "I don't expect the state to fill the (funding) commitment mandated 
by the courts." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Simms predicted that state regulators will challenge the ruling because 
the state Constitution prohibits individuals -- in this case, the Alameda 
County residents who brought the suit -- from suing the state. And, even if the 
Supreme Court upholds the decision, state regulators would face spending 
barriers set in place by the Gann Initiative, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great decision, but where's the money going to come from?" asked James 
Lott, President of the Hospital Council of San Diego and Imperial Counties. "It 
really doesn't mean a hill of beans at this point" because spending limits 
would prohibit the state from increasing state funding, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that the ruling will prompt increased state funding for adult 
indigent care programs is "as likely as the planet reversing its rotation," 
said Stephen Shubert, executive director of the San Diego Council of Community 
Clinics, a coalition of local clinics that provide care for uninsured and 
under-insured San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
The county has reduced the quantity of medical care for indigent adults in 
recent years, largely because of state budget cuts that have occurred since 
1982, when the state shifted responsibility for indigent adult medical care 
from Medi-Cal to county-run programs. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of San Diego's population is uninsured or under-insured, 
but state funding is available for just 26,000 people, leaving an estimated 
600,000 people "at risk," Shubert said. 
</P>
<P>
"With $41 million, you have real problems in holding the system together and 
keeping it working," said Shubert, who described the potential -- but unlikely 
-- $20 million windfall as "a drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
The budget that Gov. George Deukmejian proposed Jan. 10 will force more cuts in 
County Medical Services, the program that provides medical care for many 
indigent adults, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you what cuts we'll make, but . . . we'll have major system 
reductions" should the budget be introduced, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget would force county administrators to reduce health program 
funding by $4 million, Lott said. "CMS is the deep pocket for this county," 
Lott said. "But (cuts) would come at a time when we've identified an 18% 
increase in demand" for indigent medical care, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
CMS responded to previous state budget cuts by tightening up requirements and 
eliminating care for about 8% of the eligible population. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County received $41 million for its indigent-care program during the 
fiscal year that began July 1, 1988, Simms said. Deukmejian's initial budget 
for the current fiscal year calls for reducing San Diego's funding level to $35 
million. However, the $41-million level eventually was restored.

BLUE ANGELS CLIP WINGS; 1 PILOT FORCED TO EJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the Navy's Blue Angel jets collided over Superstition Mountain in El 
Centro during a practice exercise, causing one pilot to eject before his plane 
crashed, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Capt. Chase Moseley safely ejected from his F/A-18 Hornet after he and 
another pilot clipped wings while flying in a diamond formation, said Petty 
Officer Kathleen Pettaway, a spokeswoman for the Blue Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The other pilot, Cmdr. Pat Moneymaker, safely landed after the accident, which 
occurred at 12:35 p.m. Tuesday. The other two Blue Angel pilots also returned 
to the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, their winter training home. 
</P>
<P>
In the diamond formation, a trademark of the Blue Angels, one pilot leads, two 
fly side by side, and the fourth follows. During air shows, pilots sometimes 
fly the diamond formation with their wings overlapping. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's mishap, Moneymaker flew in the lead position and Moseley flew 
on the right-hand side of the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"The two planes touched or bumped, and one pilot determined that it was not 
safe to stay with the aircraft," said Senior Chief Petty Officer Bob Howard, a 
spokesman for the Pacific Fleet's Naval Air Force. "The other fellow decided 
that it was safe to stay with the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they did not know the extent of the damage to Moneymaker's 
plane. Moseley's plane, which cost about $30 million, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
After parachuting, Moseley was taken to El Centro Regional Medical Center, 
where he was treated for minor injuries, nursing supervisor Kirby Viestenz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collision is under investigation, Pettaway said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Angels are a precision drill team known for daredevil routines that 
they have performed since the group's inception in 1946. The last Blue Angels 
accident occurred in February, 1987, when a pilot had to eject after an 
accident during training, Pettaway said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Angels, also called the Naval Flight Demonstration Team, go through 
about six months of rigorous practice before beginning their nationwide 
performance season in May, Howard said. The pilots fly twice a day, six days a 
week, beginning each morning at 6 and ending in early afternoon. Briefings and 
a physical fitness program take up the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Angels' maneuvers are not special acrobatic tricks but "standard 
procedures flown by all Navy fighter pilots; it's just that the Blues do them 
in formation," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, hundreds of Navy pilots apply for the two or three openings that 
usually occur on the seven-member team. Those selected have flown thousands of 
hours and are considered the cream of Navy pilots.

POORLY RATED READING PROGRAM DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An experimental remedial reading program for seventh-graders at four San Diego 
city schools will not be continued beyond this spring, but similar courses for 
such at-risk students will probably be necessary across the district again next 
year, school district trustees decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board reconsidered the pilot program at its regular meeting Tuesday after a 
Times story earlier this month described how educators at all four schools 
disputed a negative evaluation on which the board relied last month when it 
voted to kill the program. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees strongly criticized Supt. Tom Payzant and his staff for their failure 
to send the critical evaluation to the schools for comment ahead of board 
consideration and asked for a policy change so that teachers and principals 
involved in other programs will have a chance to see evaluations ahead of board 
discussions and speak on them if desired. 
</P>
<P>
But the board spent little time questioning Payzant and others Tuesday on 
whether the contents of the reading evaluation were accurate, in part because 
only the vice principal from one of the four schools involved showed up to 
discuss the report. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, members stressed that they still have a commitment to reading 
remediation for those students reading one or more grade levels below the 
average for their age, and that they are still willing to consider new 
programs, especially because low reading achievement continues to plague many 
students, among them blacks and Latinos in numbers disproportionate to their 
total enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Kermeen Fristrom, head of the district's basic education services who strongly 
backed the pilot, told the board that special reading remediation will be 
required at many schools next year, even as the district begins using a new 
language-arts curriculum that stresses literature for 
kindergarten-through-eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
Fristrom said the pilot has many strong features, including its reading 
materials, teacher training and small class size -- half that of regular 
classes -- which many middle schools and junior highs will try to copy in their 
classes next year. However, Fristrom said, the schools probably will not have 
the money, as was available under the pilot, to have small class sizes, even 
though the evaluation showed that students in small groups, with individual 
attention from teachers, both learned to read better and developed positive 
attitudes toward reading.

Photo, An Early Start on Exercise Students at Meridian Elementary School for 
years have been learning the benefits of physical fitness in a special magnet 
program called FAST -- for Fitness, Academics and Self-Esteem Training. A 
10th-anniversary celebration Tuesday put students through their paces in an 
hourlong workout. The rigors included sit-ups, above, aerobics, below, and 
isometric stretches, which Marci Tomlinson, 9, put some teeth into. BARBARA

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ISRAELI SUSPECT HELD IN TARZANA MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aman wanted for a Tarzana murder and a Las Vegas casino robbery and attempted 
murder was in custody in New York City following his weekend arrest at the 
Israeli Consulate, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
David Hagag, 29, was charged Monday with the Dec. 27 killing of Simon 
Sarkissian, 54, of Tarzana, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hagag killed Sarkissian, a heroin dealer, during a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Hagag, an Israeli who came to this country nine months ago, is also wanted by 
Las Vegas police as a suspect in a Dec. 8 robbery at the Hilton Hotel casino in 
which a gunman grabbed $15,000 from a change booth, fled the casino and shot 
and slightly wounded a cab driver who was forced to help him escape, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where a car belonging to Hagag was 
found last week, alerted officials at the Israeli Consulate in New York to 
watch for Hagag. The suspect came to the consulate in Manhattan on Saturday 
afternoon and attempted to obtain a passport under a false name, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Consulate officials, to whom police had sent a photo of Hagag, recognized the 
suspect and called New York police after asking Hagag to wait for the passport 
in an interview room. When the suspect saw police enter the consulate, he 
attempted to commit suicide by slashing his wrists with a sharp piece of 
plastic, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hagag was not seriously injured and was being held in a New York jail 
without bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said authorities had not yet decided whether Hagag will be extradited 
first to Las Vegas or Los Angeles.

<P>
Two boys were arrested Tuesday after they set fire to their house and one day 
after they and two other boys torched a nearby home, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Monday fire, arson investigators said, four boys, three of them age 10 
and one age 13, set fire to a residence in the 3500 block of Fairmount Avenue 
about 5 p.m., using flammable liquid and matches. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the one-story house was estimated at about $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the boys then set fire Tuesday morning to their own house in the 3600 
block of 44th Street, fire officials said, causing $50 in damage. That fire was 
extinguished by the time firefighters arrived. The two, the 13-year-old and a 
10-year-old, were arrested and were being held at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters 30 minutes to bring the Monday blaze under control. No one 
was in the house, Fire Department Sgt. Frank Barone said. 
</P>
<P>
He said neighbors saw the children, who all live in the area, and alerted 
police, who then went to the homes of the children and rounded them up. The 
youths were released to their parents after Monday's fire because of their age. 
</P>
<P>
The same children vandalized the same house Sunday, Barone said.

Richard Cansdale was elevated Tuesday from vice principal to acting principal 
at Valencia Park Elementary School until the district can readvertise for a 
permanent appointment. 
</P>
<P>
There were no applicants last month among the district's 160 principals 
eligible for the job at the district's special performing-arts elementary 
school, which features a diverse student body, a host of complicated 
educational programs and plans for social service projects to help families of 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
The district will put the post at the year-round school up for applications 
again this spring and will encourage principals from outside the district to

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POSTMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES IN SLAYING OF 
DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima postman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges he shot to death a 
German shepherd on his Arleta postal route last month. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, pleaded not guilty in San Fernando Municipal Court 
to felony charges of carrying a concealed weapon, using a firearm in a grossly 
negligent manner and cruelty to animals, with the special allegation that he 
used a firearm in the commission of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling is accused of shooting the dog Dec. 26 just as the owner, Tammie 
Brody, stepped from her house to give him a Christmas gift. Brody said Sterling 
was "freaking out" and shot the dog for no reason. 
</P>
<P>
But Sterling's attorney, Salvatore Ciulla, said outside court Tuesday that the 
dog was attacking the postman. After his arrest, Sterling told authorities that 
the dog had bitten him before. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sad incident, but it wouldn't have happened if the dog had been 
tied up," Ciulla said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling refused to comment on the case except to say that he likes dogs. He 
was accompanied to court by his wife, mother and niece. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Sterling faces a maximum sentence of five years and eight months 
in prison. Sterling is on administrative leave from the Postal Service and was 
released from jail on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling is on probation for carrying a loaded firearm. A hearing on the 
misdemeanor violation is scheduled for Feb. 6.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 69-year-old San Diego man was hit by a car and killed crossing a street 
Tuesday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Smith was crossing West Mission Bay Drive when he was struck by a 
westbound car at 5:39 p.m., said Sgt. Jim Clear of the San Diego Police 
Department. Investigators believe Smith "was at fault -- that he walked into 
the path of the vehicle," Clear said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 
6:16 p.m., said San Diego Deputy Coroner David Lodge. Smith, a resident of the 
3600 block of Bayside Way, apparently was taking his customary evening walk, 
Lodge said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI PROPOSES ANTI-GRAFFITI REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles residents would receive $1,000 rewards for providing information 
leading to the conviction of graffiti vandals and people who illegally dump 
trash under an ordinance proposed Tuesday by Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he modeled his proposal after a similar ordinance enacted 1 1/2 
years ago in Palmdale, where three residents have been awarded the money for 
reporting graffiti offenders, Palmdale city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to try and utilize every tool we have to fight graffiti," Bernardi 
said. "This certainly is an idea worth exploring." 
</P>
<P>
The details of the proposed ordinance or the source of the reward money fund 
has not yet been determined. Bernardi said he included trash-dumping in the 
proposal because like graffiti, it too "disfigures many communities." 
</P>
<P>
The Bernardi motion will be studied by the City Council's Public Safety 
Committee.

BEATHARD TAPS REDSKIN TALENT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: CHARGER GENERAL MANAGER HAS TURNED TO HIS OLD TEAM, WASHINGTON, 
TO HIRE BILL DEVANEY AS DIRECTOR OF PLAYER PERSONNEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Beathard announced the first addition to his staff and it should surprise 
few that the Chargers' new director of player personnel is from his old team -- 
the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Devaney, a college scout for seven years with the Redskins, Tuesday was 
named to the position. He joins Beathard, the team's general manager, and Coach 
Dan Henning as former Redskins now with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Devaney said the opportunity to be reunited with Beathard, with whom he worked 
for six seasons before Beathard took a one-year job with NBC Sports, and his 
increased responsibilities with the Chargers were instrumental in his decision 
to leave the Redskins. But he said a commitment from Charger owner Alex Spanos 
to build a winner also was an important consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby and I have had a lot of fun working together," Devaney said. "We've done 
some good things, and that was a big part of my decision. But I really like the 
100% commitment Mr. Spanos has made to winning. We had that in Washington, and 
we know how important it is to be able to pull any string, do whatever it 
takes. That makes our job so much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Devaney said his duties will include overseeing the college and pro scouting 
departments. He said his first priority is to help the team prepare for the 
start of the two-month Plan B free agent period that begins Feb. 1, when teams 
are required to submit a list of 37 protected players to the league. 
</P>
<P>
Devaney, 34, joined the Redskins as a full-time scout in 1983. Devaney grew up 
in central New Jersey and was graduated from Elon (N.C.) College, where he was 
co-captain of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Chet Franklin, who was fired along with Steve Ortmayer, the general 
manager, and most of the rest of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The future of special teams coach Joe Madden was uncertain after Charger 
officials said they met this week with Larry Pasquale, special teams coach of 
the New York Jets, about a possible coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale was to have returned to his New York home Tuesday night after spending 
two days meeting with Charger officials. But team spokesman Bill Johnston said 
no job was offerred to Pasquale and that Madden was in his office working on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston would not comment on Madden's status. Madden has one year remaining on 
a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Pasquale nor Madden could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Madden had a difficult time in his first season with the Chargers. The Charger 
special teams had a poor start in a 40-14 season-opening loss against the 
Raiders, averaging eight yards on seven kickoff returns, including a muff that 
led to a safety. It was only a signal of more trouble to come. 
</P>
<P>
The most costly special teams mistakes came in the sixth game against Seattle 
when the Chargers lost, 17-16, after an extra point and potential 51-yard 
game-winning field goal were blocked in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The special teams did have some highlights, particularly the kick returns of 
Anthony Miller, which included a 91-yard touchdown return in a 14-12 victory in 
the rematch against the Raiders. But the Chargers finished the season below the 
NFL average in most categories and were near the bottom in kickoff and punt 
return coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Madden, 54, was hired by the Chargers last February after spending three years 
away from football. It was his first NFL job since 1986, when he was an 
administrative assistant for the Falcons when Henning coached at Atlanta. 
Madden previously was the special teams coach at Detroit from 1980-84, where he 
succeeded Pasquale after he moved to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale's status with the Jets has been in limbo since the team fired Coach 
Joe Walton after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale has a year remaining on his contract but, along with the other Jet 
assistants, has been given permission to talk with other teams, a Jet spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman, public relations assistant Brooks Thomas, said Pasquale has 
been encouraged to interview with whomever is named the new coach. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale, 48, has coached 11 seasons in the NFL, the past 10 with the Jets 
after one season with Detroit. He joined the Jets as receivers coach in 1980 
but moved to special teams the next season.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: GRANT GUARD WEINSTEIN GIVES OPPONENTS FITS TO 
THE VERY END; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TAKING CHARGE DOWN THE STRETCH, THE SENIOR FINISHED WITH MORE THAN 
HALF OF HIS TEAM'S POINTS IN AN UPSET OF NORTH HOLLYWOOD LAST WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On almost any given weekend morning, the regulars show up at a Van Nuys 
elementary school for a pick-up game. 
</P>
<P>
You can count on Keith Weinstein and the Grant High players to show up. And, 
just as regularly, Harry Marks and Robert Hill from archrival North Hollywood 
show up too. 
</P>
<P>
Except this past weekend. Because it wasn't just any given weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't show up this weekend," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
They are the North Hollywood players. 
</P>
<P>
And the Huskies should be forgiven. They had seen enough of Weinstein raining 
three-point shots. They had seen enough of him stealing the ball. They had seen 
enough of him just plain beating them. 
</P>
<P>
So why go through it again on a day off? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, 5-foot-10 shooting guard Keith Weinstein had a day to remember last 
Wednesday when Grant upset North Hollywood for the second time this season. 
Last month, in the North Hollywood tournament, Grant beat the Huskies, 54-43. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the score was 48-46 and it sent North Hollywood to its only other 
loss of the season. What role did Weinstein play? 
</P>
<P>
The senior scored 25 points -- more than half of his team's total -- on 
nine-of-15 shooting from the field. He made five three-point shots, had four 
steals and handed out a couple of assists. More importantly, he proved to be 
the coolest of players in an important game. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again down the stretch, the Lancers looked to Weinstein. Time and 
again, he answered. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can do it at the end," Weinstein said simply. 
</P>
<P>
With Grant leading, 35-33 and time running out in the third quarter, Weinstein 
scored on a buzzer-beating jump shot to make the score 37-33. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 37-37, and just 6:03 left, Weinstein launched an 
NBA-distance three-point shot and was fouled. The shot hit only net, as did his 
free throw, giving Grant a 41-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as Grant trailed, 44-43, with less than a minute remaining, Weinstein 
picked up a loose ball, streaked down the court, made a layup and was fouled, 
setting off bedlam in the gymnasium. He made the ensuing free throw and Grant 
led, 46-44. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our most valuable player," Grant Coach Howard Levine said. "He has been 
all along." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein scored nine of the team's final 13 points. Almost more crucial to him 
and his mates, though, was winning a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we play (North Hollywood) it's something special," Weinstein said. 
"Because last time we beat them, not many people thought that it was for real." 
</P>
<P>
They have to believe now. Weinstein followed his performance in the North 
Hollywood game by scoring a team-high 17 points -- in just three quarters -- on 
Friday during a routine win over Poly on seven-of-15 shooting. He made three 
three-point shots and handed out six assists. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein has made 27 of his past 50 shots from the field -- including 11 
three-point shots -- in Grant's past four games, all wins. But like a true 
disciple of the disciplined Levine, he switches to team-oriented discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play hard in every game or else," he said. "We try really hard. 
We're not at all a cocky team. We're kinda like a humble team." 
</P>
<P>
On an individual note, though, Weinstein said that he has received a few 
letters from Division II schools but likely will attend a junior college next 
fall.

SINK TO RETIRE AS BIRMINGHAM BASEBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Sink, the Birmingham High baseball coach since 1978, is retiring from 
coaching at the end of the season. But he might have saved the best for last. 
</P>
<P>
Sink, 54, whose varsity teams have never won a league title, will be coaching 
the favorite in the Mid-Valley League. Yet even with one of his more talented 
teams coming back, Sink says it was time to hand over the reins. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided it was time to get out of coaching," he said. "There's not 
enough satisfaction to warrant staying around. 
</P>
<P>
"Satisfaction comes from winning . . . There are other things I'd rather do." 
</P>
<P>
Sink, who works in the school's audio-visual department and also teaches 
physical education, will remain at Birmingham as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Glendale High and Occidental College, Sink served four years as 
an assistant football and baseball coach at Occidental before becoming a coach 
at Birmingham in 1963. Sink also has coached the Valley Encino-Tarzana American 
Legion baseball team since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Sink said he will recommend that David Contreras, the Birmingham junior varsity 
baseball coach and an assistant with the Legion team, be hired as his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves, who finished 8-12 last season and third in the Mid-Valley at 6-10, 
may be as deep as any team in Sink's career; only two players from the 1989 
team were lost to graduation. Pitchers Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield return, 
as do outfielder Danny Larson and infielder Justin Bass. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of experience, we're as good as any I can remember," Sink said.

PACIFIC DATA SEEKS NEARLY $21 MILLION IN STOCK OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Data Products, a San Diego manufacturer of accessories for laser 
printers whose sales have skyrocketed in the last year, filed a registration 
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday for an initial 
stock offering to raise $17.6 million to $20.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.2 million shares priced between $8 and $9.50 each will be offered 
for sale. Of the total, 2.2 million shares will be sold by the company and 1 
million shares by existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The company will use proceeds from the stock offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital, product development and marketing, said 
Jack Fitzpatrick, chief financial officer. The offering is being administered 
by an underwriting group co-managed by Montgomery Securities and Cowen &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Data Products was founded in February, 1986, by John Downing, a former 
marketing manager for software publishing leader Digital Equipment Corp. 
Downing raised $100,000 in start-up funds from a group of private investors and 
since has attracted venture capital backing from Summit Partners in Boston, 
which now owns 14.6% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Data Products spent its first year and a half developing software and 
hardware products that enhance the performance of desktop laser printers. By 
mid 1987, it shipped its first product, a memory board that is added to the 
guts of a laser printer to increase its built-in memory. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pacific Data Products employs 93 people and manufactures nine laser 
printer accessories, including a font cartridge that increases the number of 
fonts and print styles a laser printer can produce. The company also makes 
memory-enhancing software packages. To date, the company has sold more than 
170,000 units of its software and hardware products. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company reported $35.5 million in revenue, nearly four times its 
1988 revenue of $7.6 million. In 1989, profits grew to $5 million from $299,999 
the year before. The growth resulted from increased sales of new and existing 
products, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Data Products is one of a dozen companies "of any consequence" carving 
out a niche in the laser printer accessory market, said Jonathan Seybold, 
president of Seybold Publications in Malibu, a market research firm that 
conducts conferences in desktop publishing. 
</P>
<P>
The market for laser printer accessories has grown as the market for laser jet 
printers has expanded, Seybold said. Today, an estimated 3 million laser jet 
printers, almost two-thirds of which are manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, are 
in use nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Laser printers, which operate off a computer software program, tend to be 
quicker and quieter, and produce higher-quality print than the popular ink jet 
and dot matrix printers. But historically, they also have been more expensive 
and therefore have had little penetration in the home computer market. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts expect that to change now that industry leader 
Hewlett-Packard has introduced a laser printer that retails for less than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pacific Data Products is one of the best-known manufacturers of laser 
printer accessories and can expect to participate in the growth of the laser 
printer market, the company's future is by no means secure, Seybold said. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger in being in the add-on business is always that the manufacturer 
himself will offer the same products," Seybold said. "Hewlett-Packard is 
offering the same products (as Pacific Data Products). If you don't have an 
advantage, people are going to buy from the manufacturer rather than you, so 
you have to offer features, prices or performance that the manufacturer doesn't 
have." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pacific Data Products has priced its memory boards and font cartridge 
additions low enough to compete with Hewlett-Packard's versions.

CIPHER, ARCHIVE MOVE CLOSER TO A FRIENDLY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archive Corp., buoyed by a strong shareholder response to its $109-million cash 
tender offer, appeared Tuesday to move a step closer to its goal of acquiring 
rival Cipher Data Products of San Diego as the two firms agreed to resume their 
on-again, off-again negotiations for a friendly merger. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies, fierce competitors in the market for computer tape storage 
systems, signed a confidentiality agreement under which Cipher will provide 
Archive with non-public financial information provided that Archive does not 
disclose it to other parties. Costa Mesa-based Archive also agreed not to 
acquire more Cipher shares, except in connection with an all-cash tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
The two parties met Tuesday afternoon and are expected to release a statement 
today on the outcome of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The original Archive tender offer was scheduled to expire Tuesday but was 
extended until Jan. 31. Archive said more than 11 million Cipher shares had 
already been tendered and that those shares -- in combination with the 675,000 
shares Archive already owns -- represent 82% of Cipher's stock. 
</P>
<P>
B. J. Rone, Archive's vice president for finance, said the offer had been 
extended so that Archive's legal challenge to Cipher's "poison pill" takeover 
defense could move forward. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Friday in 
U. S. District Court in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a positive feeling about our meeting (Tuesday), and I am confident we 
will reach some sort of agreement; hopefully it will be friendly," Rone said. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher said discussions are "under way or scheduled" with other parties that 
might be interested in topping Archive's $7.50-a-share bid, but executives had 
no further comment. Cipher has retained First Boston Corp., a New York 
investment firm, to seek alternatives to the Archive offer. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Abraham, a market researcher with Freeman &amp; Associates in Santa 
Barbara, said Cipher could be attractive to other companies that make data 
storage equipment because it boasts a wide variety of products. But "no one 
company jumps out as an obvious choice" to bid for Cipher, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Archive and Cipher had discussed merger at least twice before Archive's offer, 
according to federal filings, but the talks broke down. Two weeks ago, the 
companies announced that they were negotiating a confidentiality and standstill 
agreement to clear the way for discussion of a friendly takeover at $8 per 
share, but talks were terminated the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Rone said Tuesday that it was "not a high probability" that Archive would renew 
its informal offer to sweeten its bid to $8 a share, stating that "they have 
yet to show anything to justify $7.50 a share, let alone $8." He said two 
events that have taken place since the original offer -- a shareholder lawsuit 
against Cipher management and Cipher's preliminary disclosure of a 
larger-than-expected loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 -- have made Cipher 
less valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher said it expected a loss of $11 million to $12.5 million for the quarter 
on revenue of $41.5 million, not counting takeover-related expenses. The 
company will report final earnings today. 
</P>
<P>
Archive, meanwhile, reported Tuesday that it earned $3.5 million for the 
quarter ended Dec. 29, up 9% from $3.2 million in the comparable period a year 
ago. Revenue increased 31% to $47 million from $36 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Archive and Cipher have been locked in an acrimonious patent lawsuit since May, 
1988. Some analysts have said that Archive's offer might have been prompted, in 
part, by a desire to force a favorable settlement of the suit, but Archive has 
denied the charge. Archive's patent infringement suit and Cipher's countersuit 
are expected to go to trial in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana in May. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of Archive and Cipher would create a company controlling 45% of 
the market for 0.25-inch cartridge tape drives, according to Freeman &amp; 
Associates figures. The tape drives are used to store backup copies of the 
information contained on computer disks.

ADELIZZI IS NAMED CEO AT HOMEFED

<P>
HomeFed Corp. President Robert F. Adelizzi has been named chief executive of 
the savings-and-loan holding company, taking over day-to-day management from 
Kim Fletcher, who will remain board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi joined HomeFed, the parent of HomeFed Bank, in 1962, and has been its 
president since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a board director. Adelizzi, 54, is a graduate of Dartmouth College 
and the University of San Diego School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Fletcher said his primary reason for vacating the chief 
executive's job at the $18-billion thrift is to give Adelizzi the opportunity 
to "move up and assume more responsibility and be rewarded in title at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has done an outstanding job as president and chief operating officer," 
Fletcher said. "We have worked together as a team for over 20 years, and it's 
only right that he be given the recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 62, said HomeFed has no mandatory retirement age and age was not a 
factor in his decision to step down. He will remain on certain of HomeFed's 
board committees and keep an office at the S&amp;L. Fletcher, a yachtsman, also 
said he expects to devote more time to his work on the America's Cup organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher has been HomeFed chairman since 1979 and chief executive since 1969 
and owns about 1.7% of outstanding HomeFed shares.

HomeFed has been strongly identified with the Fletcher family ever since 
Charles K. Fletcher, Kim's father, founded Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan in 
1934. The elder Fletcher retired as chairman in 1963 and died in 1986. The 
S&amp;L changed to its name last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Kim Fletcher said his family's involvement in HomeFed management will end 
with him, as none of his children plans to make a career at the S&amp;L.

JACK SMITH: OPERA'S SWAN SONGS OFTEN STRIKE STARTLING NOTES 
</P>

As we have seen here, opera is vulnerable to much unscheduled hilarity -- the 
embarrassing glitch, the grand faux pas. It may be caused by temperamental 
tenors, headstrong divas, inept stagehands and/or backstage vendettas. 
</P>
<P>
I am not surprised to hear other versions of the story about Tosca's leaping 
over the prison parapet, supposedly to her death, only to be bounced back into 
view by the trampoline meant to break her fall. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Cook of San Pedro says he found the story in "The World of Opera," by 
Wallace Brockway and Herbert Weinstock. Only it wasn't "Tosca," they say. It 
was Halevy's "La Juive," in which the heroine is tossed into a caldron of 
boiling oil. During a performance in Chicago in the 1920s, she bounced back 
into view. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore K. Millhauser nominates an incident in a performance of "Salome" as 
the funniest ever. He says the soprano had boasted that no one could ever break 
her up during an aria. A tenor challenged her, and said he could do it without 
being on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The baritone who sang John the Baptist was a hypochondriac. His dressing room 
door was always closed to shut off drafts. Offstage he stuck cotton balls in 
his ears. In the opera, John is beheaded in the cistern and his head is raised 
on a platter to be toyed with by the kinky Salome. But this time there were 
cotton balls in John's disembodied ears. Broke her up. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sarda of San Diego recalls a scene from "La Boheme" in which the 
grieving Rodolfo flings himself on the bed of the newly departed Mimi and the 
bed collapses. "Slowly the (dead Mimi's) head turns away from the audience, but 
the body is clearly convulsed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cook also says it was the great Wagnerian tenor Leo Slezak who said, 
"When does the next swan leave?" (according to my version), when a stagehand 
towed the swan-boat offstage prematurely. (Ib. J. Melchior, Lauritz's son, also 
recalled that it was Slezak.) 
</P>
<P>
According to "Opera Anecdotes" (Oxford University Press), by Ethan Mordden (I 
found it in the gift shop on the Music Center Plaza), Slezak was stranded 
offstage when the swan was pulled prematurely on stage, and what he said was, 
"Wann geht der nachste Schwan?" ("When goes the next swan?" Translation by the 
aforementioned Mr. Millhauser.) 
</P>
<P>
Whether that is a literal translation of the German, I don't know. German is to 
me an impenetrable wall. As Mark Twain said of that language, "Whenever the 
literary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to see of 
him till he emerges on the other side of the Atlantic with his verb in his 
mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Besides operatic mishaps, the book records numerous comical moments in the 
lives of its principals. In 1961, it says, Sarah Caldwell phoned Beverly Sills 
and asked her to play Rosalinde in a Boston production of "Die Fledermaus." 
Sills agreed. But her husband noted that she was seven months pregnant and 
asked her what she planned to wear. Sills phoned Caldwell back. "I can't do 
'Fledermaus,' " she said. "I'm pregnant." Caldwell thought this over. "Weren't 
you pregnant five minutes ago?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Toscanini and diva Geraldine Farrar became lovers. Finally the affair 
threatened Toscanini's marriage, and he took his family back to Italy. The 
parting with Farrar was difficult, but they remained friends. Later he was a 
guest of Farrar at a lavish dinner that included caviar. "I slept with that 
woman for seven years," the great conductor complained to a friend. "Wouldn't 
you think she'd remember that I hate fish?" 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated diplomat and wit Chauncey Depew once stared at soprano Mary 
Garden's decolletage and said, "Tell me, Miss Garden, what's holding that dress 
up?" And Garden is said to have out-fenced the nimble Depew with this riposte: 
"Your age and my discretion." 
</P>
<P>
The great contralto Ernestine Schumann-Heink was a woman of physical and 
artistic majesty. She was Czech by birth and German by training but American by 
adoption. This story makes her out to be simply a woman with a stubborn accent 
in an American drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like some powder, please," she tells the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"Mennen's?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. Vimmin's." 
</P>
<P>
"Scented?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. I take it vit me." 
</P>
<P>
If you believe that, you'll believe Tosca and the trampoline and Slezak and the 
swan.

<P>
Freud's Vienna and Other Essays, by Bruno Bettelheim (Alfred A. Knopf: $22.95, 
271 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
At 85, Bruno Bettelheim remains one of the commanding figures of psychoanalysis 
and child psychology in the 20th Century -- a man who survived the Holocaust 
and then devoted his life and work to exploring the most intimate regions of 
the human mind and the human experience. Yet Bettelheim declines to reveal very 
much of himself in print: "I believe what Freud said about biographies applies 
even more to autobiographies, namely that the person who undertakes such a task 
'binds himself to lying, to concealment, to flummery.' " Curiously, the analyst 
who has probed deeply into the heart and mind mostly refuses to divulge the 
secrets of "that most private world which I believe best remains private." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, by way of summing up a life of immense intellectual accomplishment, 
Bettelheim now offers a collection of 18 of his most important essays, none of 
which are otherwise available in book form. Bettelheim gives us a few 
tantalizing details of his own experiences in Vienna, in Dachau and elsewhere, 
but these lectures, book reviews and essays are mostly works of critical 
scholarship, not self-revelation. As I read Bettelheim's lapidary words, I had 
the sensation of strolling through an elegant sculpture garden, stopping here 
and there to contemplate the statuary. Many of these essays are famous and 
familiar, a few are even notorious, others are fairly obscure, but all reveal 
the workings of a civilized and compassionate mind. 
</P>
<P>
The first section of the book is devoted to Freud and psychoanalysis, and the 
title essay is a fine example of Bettelheim's genius for picking out what seems 
to be a narrow and even parochial topic -- the reason why psychoanalysis "was 
born and came of age" in Vienna -- and then bringing his mastery of art, 
history, letters and science to bear upon his subject. Thus, for example, we 
are reminded in "Freud's Vienna" of the political and diplomatic decline of the 
Austro-Hungarian empire; the sexual scandals of the Hapsburg court, including 
the suicide pact of the crown prince and his lover; the obsession with sex and 
death in the art and letters of turn-of-the-century Vienna, and, above all, how 
all of it influenced Freud as the founder of psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
Even more compelling is "A Secret Asymmetry," in which Bettelheim demonstrates 
his genius for turning a book review into a fascinating short course in the 
history and politics of psychoanalysis. Here, Bettelheim uses the publication 
of the letters of Dr. Sabina Spielrein, an early patient of Jung and later a 
practitioner of psychoanalysis, to reveal some of the shocking details of the 
love affair between Jung and Spielrein, to explore the rivalries between Freud 
and Jung, and to pay homage to "one of the great women pioneers of 
psychoanalysis." 
</P>
<P>
The second section of "Freud's Vienna" is ostensibly devoted to the fundamental 
theme of Bettelheim's research, writing and practice: "On Children and Myself." 
Bettelheim includes his thoughts on "The Child's Perception of the City," 
"Children and Museums" and "Children and Television," as well as an essay on 
the similarities between the techniques used by Annie Sullivan in teaching 
Helen Keller and Bettelheim's own "milieu" therapy for severely disturbed 
children. 
</P>
<P>
But the miscellaneous essays also collected here range from a discussion of the 
"essential books" of Bettelheim's life (Freud, of course, as well as the works 
of Jacob Burckhardt, Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem and Goethe) to a 
call-to-arms addressed to the makers of motion pictures: "Let us hope that the 
art of the moving image, this most authentic American art, will soon meet the 
challenge of becoming truly the great art of our age" by "giving us myths 
suitable to live by in our time, visions that transmit to us the highest and 
best feelings to which men have risen." 
</P>
<P>
The final section of "Freud's Vienna" is the most honest and touching -- and, 
for me, the most troubling and painful. In these final essays, Bettelheim 
offers a moral and historical perspective of the Holocaust that may be 
charitably described as deeply challenging. 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim praises the righteous few who acted courageously in the face of 
death, including Janusz Korczak, the director of a Warsaw orphanage who turned 
down the opportunity to save himself and instead accompanied the young children 
in his care to the gas chambers at Treblinka, and Miep Giese, the Dutchman who 
helped to shelter the family of Anne Frank. And he contemplates the special 
horrors of the "Children of the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
"The terrible silence of children who are forced to endure the unendurable!" 
Bettelheim writes in an uncharacteristic cry of despair. "Their agony is mute: 
with all the strength available to them they need to bury in the depths of 
their souls a wound, an anguish which never leaves them, a sorrow so cruel that 
it defies all expression." 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim's compassion, remarkably enough, extends not only to the German 
people, but even the tormentors of little children: "The conclusion became 
inescapable that every German had in some way or other been an inmate of that 
wider concentration camp which was the Third Reich," Bettelheim writes of his 
return to Dachau after the war. "Every German who had lived under the Nazi 
regime, whether he accepted it or fought it, had been through a concentration 
camp in a sense. Some, the actual camp inmates, had gone through it as tortured 
slaves; others, the majority of Germans, had gone through it as trustees, so to 
speak." 
</P>
<P>
Some minds and hearts may recoil at such expressions of compassion, especially 
when we consider that Bettelheim has some sharp and even shocking words for the 
Jewish victims of the Holocaust, whom he also sees as victims of "ghetto 
thinking." But the fact is that Bettelheim, although guarded about the most 
intimate details of his own life, is honest and plain-spoken when it comes to 
revealing what he has learned and what he believes. For that reason, "Freud's 
Vienna" is an accurate, useful and even inspiring gloss on the life's work of a 
man of conscience.

A MAJOR GALLERY IN HUMBLE SURROUNDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE VINCENT PRICE GALLERY AT EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE IS ONE OF THE FINEST 
OF ITS KIND. BUT MANY OF THE TREASURES ARE STORED FOR LACK OF EXHIBITION SPACE. 
</P>

<P>
It sits like an artistic oasis in a desert of beige institutional buildings, 
right down the street from a public housing project. Here, in this largely 
undiscovered exhibition hall, generations of students have viewed their first 
works by Picasso and Delacroix, and they have gone away touched and inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, with a big assist from an actor popularly known more for his horror 
movies than for his art expertise, the Vincent Price Gallery at East Los 
Angeles College in Monterey Park has amassed one of the finest art collections 
of any community college in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The public of Los Angeles doesn't know a thing about it," Price said in an 
interview from his Beverly Hills home. "It's never mentioned in the newspapers 
because I felt, and I think quite rightly, that people would think I was doing 
something for publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the genteel actor and art connoisseur, who started donating to the 
college after he addressed students there in 1951, has allowed the collection 
to stand on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
His initial gift consisted of about 90 rare artworks, including an original 
19th-Century print by the French illustrator Honore Daumier, a 16th-Century 
woodcut by the German master Albrecht Durer, an assortment of African artifacts 
and some 1,000-year-old pre-Columbian fabrics from Peru. 
</P>
<P>
On prominent display is "The Eyebrow Pencil," an exquisite 1928 Japanese 
woodcut by Ito Shinsui, which depicts a delicately drawn woman draped in a 
loosely fitting blue garment against a solid, tomato-red backdrop. Thomas 
Silliman, director of the gallery, calls the piece the most important Japanese 
woodcut of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, whose entire collection is donated, also contains original works 
by Giovanni Piranesi, one of the original modern architecture illustrators, 
Rufino Tamayo, considered by some the foremost Mexican artist alive today, and 
Howard Warshaw, an important contemporary American artist. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to provide a hands-on "study collection" full of works from 
various schools and types of art, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something students can actually take and touch and feel and do what 
they want with," he said. "Too much art is rarefied. A gallery is meant to 
serve the community. There isn't another museum or gallery in our community 
that does that. Certainly the Getty doesn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Silliman: "This is the real thing. And to be turned on by art, you've got 
to see the real thing. A picture in a book in which a painting is reduced to 
dots on a page can only remind you of what you saw. This is the first time many 
people have seen this stuff. We have an obligation to turn them on." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the gallery, which charges no admission, has inspired a few 
people who have gone on to achieve national recognition. One is actor Edward 
James Olmos, who starred in the TV series "Miami Vice," the motion picture 
"Stand and Deliver" and the Broadway play "Zoot Suit." Olmos said the Vincent 
Price Gallery was his first real exposure not only to rare artworks but to 
artistic genius and individual potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely molded and shaped my career," Olmos said. The years that he 
spent at East Los Angeles College (1964-66) rank among "the most influential 
moments of my life, especially having access to the kind of artworks that I was 
exposed to. It really elevated my awareness. What that gallery has meant to the 
community in the east part of Los Angeles has been overwhelming. It has created 
some extraordinary people." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the collection may be on the brink of moving out of community college 
obscurity. At a meeting of the gallery's foundation earlier this month, Allen 
Bassing, director of the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington, said the Smithsonian may agree to jointly sponsor a traveling 
exhibition of the gallery's works. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be very important for the collection at the gallery to have 
national exposure," said Bassing, who was invited to the college by Dean of 
Instruction Kenneth Hunt. "This is a unique facility. It's comparable to a 
collection at a very well-endowed university art gallery. It's obvious to me 
that Vincent Price has a real eye for art. He's able to look at material and 
separate the dross from the real thing. There are very few people who collect 
with such an international sphere." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery now owns approximately 1,500 pieces of art -- about three-fourths 
of it donated by Price -- with an estimated value of more than $5 million, 
Silliman said. Other significant donations have come from Mexican art 
connoisseurs Stephen Lafer and Bernard Lewin. Lewin is owner of B. Lewin 
Galleries and a prominent dealer in Mexican art. Screenwriter William Link and 
rock musician Graham Nash have contributed to the collection as well. 
</P>
<P>
But such acquisition success has its drawbacks. The gallery is now bursting at 
the seams, unable to display or properly light many of its masterworks. A 
sampling of the gallery's finest art hangs in a small, 25-by-25-foot original 
showroom, and the balance of the vast collection must be stored in the 
college's old library stacks, which now serve as a makeshift vault. A newer 
50-by-50-foot space, opened in 1986, is used for current shows, but it is 
lighted by ultraviolet-emitting fluorescent lights that rob paintings of 
brilliance and slowly fade the original colors to bluish shades. 
</P>
<P>
"The gallery has never been funded properly," said Silliman, who has taught 
classes in art appreciation and display techniques, in addition to his gallery 
duties, since arriving in 1957 while still a UCLA graduate student. "It's 
always been out of my pocket or somebody else's pocket." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned about the lack of ability to support the gallery at a 
higher level," said Omero Suarez, East Los Angeles College president. "It's a 
tremendous showpiece, a jewel in East L.A., and we need to expose it more to 
our community. We need a new facility; we need to upgrade the building that 
houses it, but the resources are not available." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, funding was spread so thin after passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 that 
the gallery was forced to close in 1979 for a year. The college administration 
budgeted $11,400 for the gallery this year -- the first such appropriation 
since Proposition 13, Silliman said. The college, which has about 14,000 
students, has a budget of $18 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the collection and help raise money for a new building, the Los 
Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees last June established the 
Vincent Price Art Gallery Foundation, said Wallace Albertson, chairwoman of the 
new foundation and former president of the community college board of trustees. 
Albertson said one of the foundation's first priorities is to put together a 
brochure and cover letter from Price to send to potential supporters. The other 
is to solve the lighting problem in the showroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this collection as being not only a resource to this campus but to the 
other eight campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District. There have 
been cooperative showings with other institutions, but nothing as major as 
there could be if we really get our act together and get organized," said 
Albertson, widow of actor Jack Albertson. 
</P>
<P>
A jointly sponsored traveling exhibition, such as one with the Smithsonian, 
could generate rental fees from participating museums and galleries around the 
country, said Hunt, the dean of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Even on a shoestring budget, the gallery has racked up a number of 
achievements. In 1981, it sponsored the first show by Mexican artist Tamayo in 
the United States, Silliman said. The gallery co-sponsored the first 
state-funded Chicano art exhibit in 1975, and in 1968 it was the first gallery 
or museum in the nation to show cinema as an art form, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, as part of an ongoing series of one-man shows titled "Coming Home 
Again," plans to feature the art of East Los Angeles College alumni, including 
Gilbert Lujan, Kent Twitchell and Gronk, who have become accomplished artists. 
Last semester, the gallery staged a retrospective of works by alumnus George 
Yepes, the artist known for his cover of the Los Lobos album, "La Pistola y El 
Corazon," and his darkly passionate and dreamlike interpretations of such 
primal themes as death, lust, decadence and pride. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's most popular shows have attracted more than 25,000 visitors from 
the college and surrounding community during the exhibits' four- to six-week 
runs, Silliman said. 
</P>
<P>
And, inevitably, some puzzle over the Vincent Price connection. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here in 1957, my first comment was, 'What is Vincent Price 
doing with an art collection in a dump like this?' " Silliman said. "And it 
still applies. But the question is the answer: It's really needed here. That's 
been my whole cause, and Mr. Price's too -- accessibility to art. If it's not 
at the community colleges, then Jesus God, where is it going to be? There's 
still a kind of barrier. Art museums tend to be elitist. It's the fur coats who 
get invited to the openings." 
</P>
<P>
Price's introduction to the college came when he was invited to speak there in 
1951 about "the aesthetic responsibility of the citizen." Challenged by the art 
department chairman to initiate a collection there, he and his then-wife did so 
because they were impressed by students' interest "in something as foreign and 
as far away from the necessities of life to them as art," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
His affection was cemented a few years later after several works of art were 
stolen out of a storage closet. The art department posted a sign reading: "Mr. 
and Mrs. Price gave this collection for all the students." 
</P>
<P>
The thief returned the art. 
</P>
<P>
"That," Price said, "endeared me forever to it." 
</P>
<P>

TROLLEYS RIDE WAVE OF SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: TO ACCOMMODATE A RIDERSHIP BOOM, THE EL MONTE SYSTEM HAS ADDED 
SATURDAY SERVICE AND PLANS AN ADDITIONAL ROUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUZ MARICELA VILLARREAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The small woman boarding a bright blue trolley in El Monte was all but buried 
under her load of laundry and grocery bags. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Galdamez, the woman beneath the sacks, was taking food to her niece, who 
lives on the other side of town. After that, she planned to jump back on the 
trolley for a trek to do her laundry nearby. 
</P>
<P>
With no car and little inclination to take the more expensive RTD buses, the 
25-cent trolley, with free transfers, is Galdamez's ride of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ride the RTD buses because it's so expensive," Galdamez said in 
Spanish. "If I rode those buses every day, I would be paying $2.20. This really 
saves me a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Galdamez, who recently came from El Salvador with her children, found out about 
the low-cost system through a friend and has since become a regular passenger. 
Because of the quarter fares, her family members also take advantage of the 
system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
They're part of the recent ridership explosion taking place aboard the El Monte 
trolley system, a four-route transportation service designed to carry 
passengers to shopping malls, schools, neighborhoods and through the city's 
civic center. 
</P>
<P>
The trolleys started running in March, 1988. Three months later, monthly 
ridership stood at 9,000, then rose to 19,000 by August, 1988. Within the last 
couple of months, the monthly average has been 44,000 passengers, said Roger 
Williams, general manager for American Transit Enterprises Rider Transit 
Contracting Division, which has contracted with the city to operate and 
maintain the system. 
</P>
<P>
"It has just exploded during the last year," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the riders are mothers and their children and students going to school, 
he said. And children 4 years old and younger ride free. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the boom, the system's hours have expanded to include Saturdays 
as well as weekdays. The trolleys run from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and make their 
rounds every 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The trolleys -- color-coded red, blue, green or yellow, depending on their 
route -- start running at the Trolley Station in the El Monte Valley Mall on 
Lexington Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Byerly, city transportation services manager, first brought the idea of a 
city trolley system to the Parks and Recreation Commission. From there, the 
idea made its way to the City Council and was approved. 
</P>
<P>
"We had several meetings among ourselves," Byerly said. "Everybody agreed that 
we needed a fixed-route system in El Monte. I like the trolley concept. It was 
the unique thing we were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started it, people rode it just to say they rode the trolley. 
Since then, ridership has increased and increased to where we are near 
capacity. I'd have to say it's because of word-of-mouth publicity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high demand, the city has ordered three new trolleys. Officials 
are planning an additional route, and some of the existing lines may be 
rerouted. All of the trolleys, new and old, also will be equipped with 
wheelchair lifts. None now have such devices. 
</P>
<P>
Byerly said the system is funded by the city's share of money from Proposition 
A, a half-cent sales tax earmarked to improve transportation in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger fares pay approximately one-third of the operating costs, which 
average about $28,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte's is one of six trolley systems operating in the county, said Clara 
Potes, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. The 
others are in Bellflower, the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, Inglewood, 
Lawndale and Monterey Park. Lawndale ridership figures were not available, but 
statistics provided by the other local systems show that El Monte's trolleys 
attract the most riders. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only drawback to trolley-riding in El Monte is its popularity, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"The disadvantage for the moment is that sometimes the trolleys are a bit 
overcrowded. That's why we are going to add new routes and trolleys," he said. 
"It's a nice little system, and it should be nicer with the upcoming 
implementations." 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Gorham, a 65-year-old trolley driver, said the system is the best 
thing that has happened to the city of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 200% cheaper than the RTD. People who ride every day really save 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham has no complaints about his job. As the doors open, he says, he sees 
familiar faces and many times knows passengers by name. He has encountered 
people from all walks of life and even made a new friend or two. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this 12-year-old girl who rides the trolley every day, and she always 
tells me that Jesus loves me. She's invited me to her church on Sunday 
mornings," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name is Carla," he said. "She and her mother gave me a Christmas present 
of dishes and cups. She also wrote me a letter. It just tore me up." 
</P>
<P>
Another familiar passenger on Gorham's route is Lucy Orosco of El Monte. 
Recently honored as the 500,000th passenger to ride the trolleys, Orosco 
received a free one-year trolley pass and gift certificates at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blessing for me. I wasn't expecting it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has ridden the trolleys almost every day since the service started, taking 
her grandson to school and socializing along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I've met a lot of people while riding the trolleys. I met four boys who were 
on their way to Arroyo High School. I've given them all nicknames," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, she said, riding the trolley has been memorable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not good," she said. "It is excellent service."

GOSPEL MUSIC STORE AN UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE FOR VISITORS, OWNER

<P>
When Cecil Martin opened The Praise Experience, a gospel record and tape store, 
she feared that running the small business would take time away from her street 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
She needn't have worried. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening shop at 1357 N. Lake Ave., Martin, 51, said customers, strangers 
and even street people have looked to her for spiritual comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to touch the lives of my customers," the soft-voiced Martin 
said, unconsciously stretching her hand outward. "I've been able to pray with a 
lot of people right across my counter." 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration, she told of the time a well-dressed man entered, obviously 
distressed, and asked for a specific recording. When Martin told him she didn't 
have the record and apologized, the man confided that he needed the music to 
comfort himself. His wife had died the day before. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'I know you're a man and all, and you have to be macho, but it's 
all right to cry,' " Martin said. "He just started sobbing. I wanted to put my 
arms around him, but I said, 'If you don't mind, I'll just stand here and 
whisper a prayer for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Martin said the man thanked her, telling her that before he 
entered the shop he had been so overcome with grief that he didn't know how he 
would carry on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those kinds of stories that I could give, on and on," Martin said. "I 
don't know why. It's something about me." 
</P>
<P>
Such occurrences have made The Praise Experience an apt name. But in between, 
Martin does manage to sell a few records and tapes from her "totally gospel" 
store. With the demise last year of an Altadena gospel record store, Martin 
said her 3-year-old shop is the only such specialty store in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
From her spot at the rear of the store, where a battered refrigerator and small 
black-and-white TV set have been installed, Martin passes her afternoons, 
greeting customers in an almost girlish voice. Framed pictures for sale of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. adorn the wall along with record posters and T-shirts 
reading, "Attention! All parties in Hell have been canceled because of fire. No 
exit doors available." 
</P>
<P>
To browse through the record bins in the small shop is to take an intensive 
course in gospel musicology. Old-style gospel male quartets and groups from the 
1950s and 1960s are represented in recordings by the Gospel Keynotes, the Dixie 
Hummingbirds, the Jackson Southernairs), the Soul Stirrers and the Five Blind 
Boys of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Choir recordings of traditional gospel songs are available from Mississippi 
Mass, the Edwin Hawkins group, choirs from New Jersey and Los Angeles churches, 
L.A. Mass and Martin's own church, West Angeles Church of God in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Also available are contemporary gospel recordings such as those by Beau 
Williams, the Clark Sisters, the Winans and Commissioned. Martin even stocks 
the rap gospel of Soldiers for Christ and the hip, jazzy a cappella recordings 
of Take 6. 
</P>
<P>
She admitted, however, that "I've listened to Take 6, but I don't get it." And 
she lamented: "The gospel music where I come from has sort of been put aside or 
put on hold. We're getting away from that sound, the music that has the spirit 
that will move you." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the popularity of the contemporary gospel style, Martin said, old 
recordings of Mahalia Jackson and the Clara Ward Singers are hard to come by. 
But she keeps a list of customers who desire such music and notifies them when 
she finds the records. 
</P>
<P>
The shop draws customers from San Gabriel Valley cities such as Monrovia and 
Duarte, and from as far away as Orange County and San Diego. In addition, 
Martin said, she corresponds with mail-order customers from Anaheim and 
Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who lives in Altadena, entered the record store business with no 
previous retail experience. She had planned to open a used-clothing store, but 
when obstacle after obstacle reared up, she said she decided to let God show 
her the way. After prayer, the idea for a record store came to her, and she 
promptly went into business with her daughter Mari Martin as a co-owner. And 
everything fell into place. 
</P>
<P>
"Things started to unfold for me, and nothing had unfolded for me before," she 
said. "It seemed the more I prayed, the more the Lord put the seal on it." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk is second nature to Martin, the daughter of a Methodist minister from 
Texas. In her youth, Martin said, secular music was not allowed within earshot 
of her father. The family set aside Sunday only for worship. Sunday's church 
clothes were ironed the night before, and Sunday dinner was prepared on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd go to church, come home, eat and go back to church again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin continued her devotion into adulthood by singing in church choirs and 
participating in church activities and street ministries. The gospel record 
store, which Martin said has not yet become a real money maker, is yet another 
expression of that devotion. 
</P>
<P>
Said Martin: "I'm here for the glory of God and any way I can lift up his name 
or glorify his name, because he's my all in all."

G N' R LANGUAGE ON ABC DRAWS HEAT 
</P>

<TEXT>

ABC was swamped with complaints after members of the heavy-metal band Guns N' 
Roses uttered profanities during Monday night's live telecast of the American 
Music Awards. While the profanities were heard by millions of viewers watching 
the show in the East, the segments were deleted from the tape-delayed West 
Coast version. 
</P>
<P>
The band members, no strangers to controversy, won two awards. The first was 
for favorite heavy-metal group; the other for best heavy-metal album, "Appetite 
for Destruction." The band was cut off the first time when guitarist Slash used 
a profanity. Slash and another band member were cut off again when they began 
using profanities while accepting the second award. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, ABC issued an apology: "We regret that last night's live telecast 
of the American Music Awards contained some offensive language. This has not 
happened before in the 17 years this awards show has been on the air. We will 
take precautionary measures to see that it does not happen in future 
telecasts." JEFF KAYE

SAX MAN MCPHERSON BRINGS OPENING NIGHT TO LIFE

<P>
Saxophonist Charles McPherson kicked a sputtering rhythm section to life and 
turned in a solid opening-night performance last week at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, the San Diego alto man raised on be-bop, is fronting a crew of 
locals, including special guest Peter Sprague on guitar, through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The opening set last Wednesday included several smoking Charlie Parker 
standards, plus a couple of slow tunes and a new piece by McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
In search of perfection, the sax man strolled into the audience several times 
to check the sound. That gave Sprague, who first recorded with McPherson more 
than 10 years ago, plenty of room to shine. And shine he did, unleashing a 
barrage of licks that showed his increasing maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Sprague was more than up to the fast bop paces McPherson put the band through 
on several tunes. McPherson lit into Charlie Parker's "Bloomdido," and he 
quickly displayed the solid tone he recently described as "a compact sound with 
a good core, with a little bit of buzz around it." It cuts like a knife, even 
with its warm and fuzzy edges. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm section of Gunnar Biggs on bass, Randy Porter on piano and Charles 
McPherson Jr. on drums had trouble finding the groove on the Latin-flavored 
"Tangerine." Papa McPherson showed lightning speed and musical inventiveness as 
he turned out long lines of extemporaneous melody, but the inconsistent 
rhythmic undercurrents dragged things down. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson had promised to debut new material, and, with a wry smile, soon 
introduced "Delusions, Contusions, Confusions, Illusions and Blue." 
</P>
<P>
If this is indicative of the direction his work is taking, McPherson should 
have a new recording contract soon. The sweet, slow number unfolded gracefully, 
McPherson restating the musical theme each time in a slightly higher key, 
punctuating the calm with occasional funky honks. The haunting mood was 
reminiscent of saxophonist Wayne Shorter's mid-'60s work. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson seems to have succeeded where others have failed, writing music that 
could reach a broad audience without dipping into bubble gum territory. 
</P>
<P>
With "Confirmation," another Parker tune, the band started to hit its stride. 
An especially nice section came with Sprague soloing as McPherson and Biggs 
doubled up on background harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Sprague eased into the standard "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" by himself, softly 
finger-picking the melody and chords. As the rhythm section faded in, it became 
obvious that Porter seems most comfortable with these slow ballads.

MONTY HALL DEALS HIMSELF OUT OF 'DEAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monty Hall has made his last deal. 
</P>
<P>
The creator and original host of "Let's Make a Deal" will not resume his duties 
when the show returns to NBC's daytime lineup this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I did 4,500 episodes and I'm looking for new fields to conquer," Hall said 
Tuesday. "I am committed to finding the new host, and will teach him. I'm also 
going to pop up on the show from time to time as a surprise guest." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the best advice he could give his successor was "to love the people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wild show and you can't allow yourself to be turned off," Hall said. 
"You have to keep your sense of equilibrium and treat your guests with 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who created the series along with partner Stefan Hatos, remains as 
half-owner of the series. The new series will be a production of dick clark 
productions, inc., in association with Ron Greenberg Productions. "Let's Make a 
Deal" will be taped in Orlando, Fla., at the Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park as 
part of a permanent attraction at the amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal" premiered in December, 1963, on the NBC daytime lineup, 
where it ran until 1968, when it switched to ABC, continuing until 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 64, is currently doing commercials and guest appearances, with much of 
his time spent performing his duties as the International Chairman of Variety 
Clubs International, one of the world's largest children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
A former sportscaster, Hall said he has been approached to co-host a sports 
show with his son Richard. Hall said he has also been asked to host several 
proposed game shows, an idea he said he is not opposed to. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be as exciting as "Let's Make a Deal,"" Hall said. "I 
wouldn't just want to be a traffic cop type of host, but the kind of host where 
I would get to perform 30 minutes a day. When 'Let's Make a Deal' was over, you 
knew you were through a half hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal" also had the distinction, along with "The Newlywed Game," 
of being the last prime-time network TV game show during a 1969-71 run on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The show was also syndicated from 1971-76 and revived in 1980 and 1984.

he will be involved in choosing the new host of the daytime game show.

$20-MILLION LAWSUIT FILED OVER 'LOOK WHO'S TALKING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES FILM EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writer-director Amy Heckerling took her inspiration for her hit movie "Look 
Who's Talking" from a 20-minute student film and other materials supplied her 
four years before "Look Who's Talking" was released last fall, according to a 
$20-million lawsuit filed against her and Tri-Star Pictures Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Tri-Star, which is distributing "Look Who's Talking," of 
conspiring with Heckerling to infringe Jeanne Meyers and Rita Stern's 
copyright. The suit also names Heckerling's associate, actress Twink Caplan. 
Caplan is alleged in the suit to have acted as Heckerling's liaison with them 
during their early contacts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Federal Court, says that Meyers and Stern 
approached Heckerling in late 1985 or early 1986 about adapting a short film 
that Meyers had herself adapted from Damon Knight's short story, "Special 
Delivery," for an American Film Institute project in 1984. Meyers and Stern 
claim in the suit that Heckerling asked to see the film and other story 
materials and that she kept in touch -- through Caplan -- for several months 
before writing them to say she was not interested in pursuing the project. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, in January, 1987, Meyers and Stern say in the filing, they 
optioned "Special Delivery" to Tri-Star Pictures with the understanding that 
attempts would be made to develop it as a TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Special Delivery" is described in the suit as a science-fiction story about "a 
married couple who learn that the wife's unborn child has full, adult 
consciousness, a genius intellect, and the extraordinary ability to communicate 
with its parents and others in an audible manner although still in the womb." 
</P>
<P>
With Heckerling's film, which has taken in $125 million in ticket sales, only 
the audience hears the fetus' thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Heckerling, a graduate of AFI, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
Caplan, in a statement released through her publicist, said Meyers and Stern 
had sent a tape of "Special Delivery" to them, but it was not in a format they 
could conveniently see. Caplan said that neither she nor Heckerling ever saw 
the short film or a script. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times in October, Heckerling said she conceived the 
idea for "Look Who's Talking" shortly after her 4-year-old daughter, Mollie, 
was born. Heckerling said she and her husband, writer-director Neal Israel, 
kept putting thoughts into the baby's mouth while wondering what she was 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
In their suit, Meyers and Stern list numerous similarities between their 
material and the film, saying that in both works, the lead character is a 
pregnant Jewish-American career woman with a male fetus who talks to the 
audience in a comedic voice-over. The plaintiffs' story and the film both open 
with the graphic act of fertilization and follow the talking fetus through its 
gestation. Both stories end with the arrival of the baby's sister. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which accuses the defendants of copyright infringement, unfair 
competition, theft of trade secrets and breach of contract, was filed by the 
Santa Monica law firm of James P. Tierney. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers and Stern are seeking compensatory damages of $10 million and punitive 
damages of $10 million.

The Massachusetts Board of Education approved rules that will do away with 
undergraduate education majors and instead require prospective teachers to 
focus on subjects such as history, English and chemistry. The action, which 
also will require a master's degree for teacher certification, reflects a 
national trend in which school systems are looking for instructors who know 
more about the subject they are teaching.

Death Row inmate Clarence Brandley was freed on bond from the Ellis 1 Unit 
prison in Huntsville, Tex., one month after an appeals court threw out his 
conviction on charges of raping and killing a teen-ager in a case tainted by 
racism. Brandley's release came after a state judge in Conroe, Tex., set his 
bond at $75,000 and one month after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals threw 
out Brandley's capital murder conviction. Brandley's attorneys had offered 
evidence that police and Montgomery County prosecutors had set out to prove 
that Brandley, the only black janitor at Conroe High School was guilty rather 
than seeking the young white woman's killer.

Mayor David N. Dinkins has asked that an outside counsel be appointed to 
investigate some of his activities as Manhattan borough president. 
</P>
<P>
Susan E. Shepard, whom Dinkins appointed as city commissioner of investigation, 
told the City Council's Committee on Rules, Privileges and Elections that the 
mayor had told her to appoint an independent counsel. The Department of 
Investigation is examining a possible conflict of interest in Dinkins' failure 
to disclose his stock holdings in the Inner City Broadcasting Co., which held a 
cable television franchise in the city. Dinkins has said he transferred the

JAMES FLANIGAN: IN AMERICA, THERE'S REASON FOR OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's going on? The stock market careens like a drunken driver while big-name 
bankruptcies and junk bond defaults produce a mean hangover to start 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But don't panic. It's not the end of the world, only the end of the 1980s -- a 
decade of easy money, big deals and rising stock prices for many companies -- 
the Dow Jones industrial index started the decade below 1,000 and finished it 
above 2,600, where it remains even after Monday's volatile price swing. 
</P>
<P>
Those swings reflect confusion among big institutional investors -- the pension 
and mutual funds, bank trust departments and international insurance companies 
that make up 85% of the trading on major stock exchanges. They're worried that 
inflation will increase in the U.S. economy, that interest rates will rise and 
that company profits will decline. 
</P>
<P>
But a calm look at the situation says the institutions are mistaken on two of 
three of their worries. And beyond the near term, the outlook for the U.S. and 
world economies is bright. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which totaled 4.6% last year, is not a real concern for the U.S. 
economy. Business is slowing, and prices are under pressure. The car rental 
companies recently tried to lift rates, couldn't do it. Energy prices went up 
with the cold snap in December and are now backtracking. Industrial raw 
material prices are down. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates aren't falling at the moment, but they may soon because demand 
for credit in the United States is low. Total borrowings by households, 
companies and state and local governments grew only 4% -- less than inflation 
-- in last year's fourth quarter, notes Charles Clough, chief investment 
strategist for Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard for interest rates to rise when loan demand is falling -- although 
one explanation for continuing high rates is that overseas economies are 
growing and increasing demand for U.S. dollars and fresh capital. Still, the 
prospect for the year ahead is that U.S. interest rates will decline. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves lower corporate profits as a possibly valid worry. Some big 
companies and major banks have lately reported profit declines, and this has 
shaken the institutions that concentrate their investments on big companies. 
</P>
<P>
But the economy has been slowing for a while. The gross national product may 
have grown only 0.4% in last year's fourth quarter, virtually a standstill. 
Declines in small company stocks on over-the-counter markets and major 
exchanges already reflect this slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The point to keep in mind, though, is that the slowdown is a pause in a healthy 
economy, not a symptom of lingering illness -- as the aftermath of the 1980s 
often makes it seem. Borrowings grew tremendously in the last decade -- 
commercial and residential mortgages went from $1.5 trillion in 1982 to $3.4 
trillion last year. The result is a glut of buildings in many parts of the 
country and, inevitably, troubled markets. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds, at $200 billion total, make up only a fraction of the total debt 
buildup. But junk's after-effects will be with us for a while. Moody's 
Investors Service estimates that $20 billion in junk bonds will default this 
year, causing troubles for high-yield mutual funds, savings and loans and a few 
insurance companies that have large junk bond holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But leverage is history. Individual Americans are now saving 6% of their income 
-- up from less than 3% in 1987 -- and banks are making fewer loans, cleaning 
up their balance sheets. And companies troubled by debt are vastly outnumbered 
by well-capitalized firms. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than looking back, institutional investors should look ahead. For 
individuals, it promises to be the decade of the saver not the spender. And for 
industry, it should be a decade of export opportunity as Europe, led by West 
Germany, and Asia, led by Japan, enjoy growing consumer economies that in good 
measure will be supplied from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Economists such as Clough of Merrill Lynch and Edward Hyman of C. J. Lawrence 
Morgan Grenfell see the United States as supplier to the world in the 1990s, 
with low capital costs and the dollar as the strongest currency. It's a vision 
of a fully employed, high-export, low-inflation United States, contrasting with 
other countries just entering the era of personal consumption that America has 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
And those who would question such optimism might reflect on how much the United 
States is capable of: After all, even in the last decade of easy money and 
spurious deals it managed to maintain the defense of the Western nations and 
lay the groundwork for world prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Sure it's sometimes the land of the quick buck and short-term focus. But at 
other times it's the land of the honest dollar and faith in the future. The 
1990s could be one of those other times.

AMI'S NEW CHIEF WIELDS SCALPEL TO CUT HEAVY DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: HARRY J. GRAY BELIEVES THAT HIS EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER HEAD OF 
UNITED TECHNOLOGIES WILL HELP HIM IN HIS QUEST TO LIGHTEN THE DEBT BURDEN OF 
THE RECENT BUYOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1970s as head of United Technologies, Harry J. Gray was one of the 
master builders of the giant conglomerate. Today, as chairman of American 
Medical International, Gray has traded his trowel for a scalpel as he tries to 
whittle down the hospital company that he and a group of investors acquired 
last October for $1.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, the 70-year-old executive said he doesn't intend to 
dismantle AMI, but he has moved aggressively on his predecessors' plans to sell 
$1 billion in AMI assets and drastically reduce the corporate staff to cope 
with the buyout debt. To date, Gray said AMI has sold two hospitals for about 
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
AMI has stated a goal of reducing the corporate staff to about 400 people from 
about 1,000 (down from about 1,500 last year) who work in Beverly Hills, Marina 
del Rey, Costa Mesa and field offices outside California. Gray said he expects 
that there will be about 100 people at the new corporate headquarters when the 
company completes a planned move to Dallas from Beverly Hills. The company may 
also make more cuts in its data processing operations in Marina del Rey and 
Costa Mesa, he said. "We've had a lot of data processing that may not be 
absolutely necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When AMI announced its move last month, the Beverly Hills headquarters had 
about 200 people, and the Marina del Rey and Orange County sites combined had 
about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Before his involvement with AMI, Gray's closest look at the health-care 
industry was from the perspective of a patient -- one lying flat on his back in 
traction. More than two decades ago, he suffered a serious motorcycle accident 
that shattered his thighs and put him on crutches for eight months. He sealed 
his reputation for toughness and tenacity when he moved his office into the 
hospital, missing only two days of work. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts caution that hospitals present a unique set of management problems for 
Gray. For one thing, demand for services is largely beyond the control of 
managers, they said, and hospitals in particular are under pressure from 
competitors to maintain costly equipment while government and private insurers 
demand that they limit patient stays and justify their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although his management experience has been mostly in defense industries, Gray 
said his experience with service companies owned by United Technologies will 
apply to AMI. "I find it rather comfortable moving into AMI. There are quite a 
few analogies I find helpful, especially in cost control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the health-care industry has not been sufficiently attentive to 
controlling costs. "To survive, they must deliver quality on a cost-effective 
basis," Gray said. AMI has already implemented an incentive program for 
hospital executive directors. The managers win and lose points based on how 
they manage their working capital, how discharged patients respond to an 
independent survey on the quality of their treatment and an outside review of 
the performance of the hospital's doctors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The program thus far has resulted in some "pleasant" surprises, Gray said. Some 
of the hospitals targeted for sale because of lackluster performance are doing 
better. That doesn't necessarily mean that they won't be sold, but it "does 
make them more palatable" to potential buyers. Hospitals that were targeted for 
sale, he said, were those that could not produce enough operating cash flow to 
pay for capital improvements and to contribute their share of the total AMI 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
AMI intends to sell all 23 of its foreign hospitals and about seven of the 
domestic hospitals, leaving the restructured AMI to operate about 40 hospitals. 
Despite analysts' worries that AMI would not get the best prices for the 
hospitals because the industry has far more hospitals for sale than buyers, 
Gray said the two AMI hospitals sold so far attracted bids higher than 
expected. The company sold its Singapore hospital and a facility in North Miami 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said his goal is not only to pare costs at AMI, but to foster a new 
"corporate culture." He explained: "Our purpose is to convince the people who 
are not directly associated with a hospital that their function in life is to 
serve the hospitals." To foster that, Gray said the new corporate headquarters 
will be known as the "service center." Gray said the role of chief executive 
was not one that he envisioned for himself when he decided last year that AMI 
was a good investment. IMA Acquisition Corp., jointly owned by Gray's 
investment firm and First Boston Corp., won a bidding contest for AMI triggered 
last spring when a group led by M. Lee Pearce, an AMI director and major 
shareholder, proposed to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no intent to go back into active management," Gray said, explaining 
that he had little choice when AMI Chairman and Chief Executive Richard 
Gilleland resigned suddenly after the buyout. Gilleland had been brought to AMI 
less than a year earlier after successfully turning around a troubled Texas 
health-care concern. Shareholders, dissatisfied with the pace of AMI's recovery 
from a $97.3-million loss in 1986, had pressured Gilleland's predecessor, 
Walter Weisman, to resign in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gilleland said earlier that he didn't want to invest in an AMI buyout and 
decided he didn't want to manage the company long term, Gray said. "I think he 
did the best that he could for the shareholders. I think he was surprised that 
others wanted to buy the company," he said. Gilleland couldn't be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts speculated that Gilleland resigned because he feared that Gray 
would demand too big of a decision-making role after he joined the board upon 
completion of the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
As head of United Technologies for 14 years, Gray was known for a reluctance to 
share power and groom a successor. Four men who might have succeeded him as 
chairman either quit or were forced to resign, associates said. Gray was 
accused of ordering the bugging of the home and office of one of the company's 
presidents before the man's resignation. But a committee of United Technologies 
directors cleared him in an internal investigation conducted in 1984, and Gray 
has always steadfastly denied the alleged bugging. That same year, as Gray 
neared the mandatory retirement age of 65, directors forced him to choose a 
successor. Gray retired at the end of 1986 and was succeeded by Robert F. 
Daniell, who was earlier elected president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
A Georgia native who started his career in sales, Gray held various posts at 
Litton Industries in California in the 1950s and '60s. He became United 
Technologies' president in 1971. By the time he left, he had built the 
Hartford, Conn.-based company from a $2-billion aerospace company to a 
$16.3-billion conglomerate and a leading defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Some people called him "the shark" and "Jack the Ripper" for his record of 
successful takeovers, such as that of Otis Elevator and Carrier Corp. If there 
is a notable blemish on Gray's record as a shrewd manager, it was United 
Technologies' 1982 involvement in the complicated takeover battle between 
Bendix Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. United Technologies baffled many 
observers when it jumped into the fray as an ally of Martin Marietta, which had 
responded to an unsolicited takeover bid from Bendix by attempting to swallow 
Bendix instead. Of the companies involved in the so-called Pac Man war, United 
Technologies emerged relatively unscathed as Allied Corp. leaped in and 
swallowed Bendix, and Martin Marietta remained independent at a huge cost.

ISRAELI ARMS FIRMS SWITCH TO PLOWSHARES 
</P>

<P>
Budget cuts at home and shrinking markets abroad under the effects of the Cold 
War thaw are forcing arms makers in Israel to convert to civilian production to 
avert an unparalleled business crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Swords-to-plowshares, tanks-to-toys planning among Israeli defense industries 
mirrors a process under way in the United States, where major contractors are 
diversifying and cutting back labor forces in response to reduced military 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the success of the adjustment will go a long way to setting the pace 
for the country's economic growth in this decade. State and privately owned 
arms industries in Israel account for one-quarter of the country's industrial 
output. Exports average about $1 billion a year to customers that include the 
United States, Canada and Western European nations, as well as Third World 
clients as far-flung as Singapore and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Because exports help bankroll the country's domestic industry, a slowdown in 
that sector could also affect Israel's relative self-sufficiency in arms. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to follow the market," said Phil Herman, a spokesman for Israel 
Aircraft Industries, the country's largest military contractor. "With the 
decrease in defense budgets, the military-industrial complex will be looking 
for other missions to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
In its battle against chronic inflation, the government has shaved military 
spending during the past several years, and there are calls for deeper cuts. 
Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, recently called for cuts of at 
least $150 million a year from the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
His call, which set off a storm of debate, was based in part on reports that 
Syria, considered Israel's most aggressive adversary, is reducing its defense 
spending. The Soviet Union is reported to have told Syria that Moscow would no 
longer bankroll Syria's effort to reach arms equality with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's defense ministry is resisting cutbacks, arguing that the nation can 
ill afford the risk of reduced levels of equipment and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many people in the defense establishment who believe that even 
if peace is some day achieved, Israel's security situation will still be 
regarded with the utmost gravity, and Israel will have to maintain its 
vigilance," a ministry official told Israeli reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials note that the struggle to put down the Arab uprising in the 
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank has also cut into outlays for equipment 
designed for the defense of Israel's borders. Last year, the army spent about 
$200 million on everything from bullets to new jails to battle the intifada, as 
the Arab revolt is known. The expenditures were only partially made up for with 
extra money from the treasury. 
</P>
<P>
"The intifada has definitely cut into acquisition of new equipment," said 
Shalom Eitan, a spokesman for Tadiran, the third-largest private industrial 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Most Israeli defense firms have the advantage of already producing consumer 
goods. Tadiran, for instance, makes a variety of appliances, including 
refrigerators and microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
"At least, Israeli companies won't be starting from scratch," commented Zeev 
Eytan, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, a defense think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
But the end of the Cold War is compelling changes at a faster pace than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knew that the Berlin Wall would fall so fast. Our plan, which had been 
to move into civilian fields, is going to go faster than anticipated," 
Tadiran's Eitan predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Tadiran began to sense the shifting mood during the final years of the Reagan 
Administration when arms agreements showed the way to reduced superpower 
tensions, Eitan said. The winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the 
Iran-Iraq conflict were further signposts on the road to a new era. 
</P>
<P>
Within Israel, budget cuts began to take hold three years ago, and Tadiran 
began a difficult process of cutting its work force to 10,000 from 14,500. Its 
current balance of military and civilian production, mainly in communications, 
is 50-50. The company plans to move toward a 70%-30% mix in favor of civilian 
sales, Eitan said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Aircraft is also beginning to market goods originally designed for the 
military for civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference between military and civilian uses, in many cases, is that 
the military product goes boom," spokesman Herman quipped. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a pilotless airplane that was built for military reconnaissance is 
now being advertised for use in televised monitoring of forest fires, oil 
spills and even drug dealers carrying contraband across remote frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to the trend at Israel Aircraft is its continuing effort to 
develop a fighter jet. The company suffered a grave setback two years ago when 
its Lavi fighter was canceled after it became clear that the Israeli government 
could not afford to pay for development and that Washington, Israel's biggest 
aid giver, was not interested in footing the bill. The company laid off about 
6,000 of its 22,000 workers and lost tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The new jet under study at Israel Aircraft is a more economical model. Company 
officials deny that it is meant to make up for the Lavi cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the airplane business, and so we must look ahead. If we find a 
customer for it, good," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
A cheaper fighter jet would seem ready-made for the regional conflicts that 
still flourish outside the fading superpower rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"We can see just in the example of Panama that small conflicts and 
low-intensity warfare are still around," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is Israel's biggest customer for military goods, with sales 
estimated at $150 million, according to the Jaffee Center for Strategic 
Studies. Among other top customers are Spain, which buys tank guns, tank fire 
control systems and range finders; Chile (tanks and air-to-air missiles); 
Brazil (surface-to-surface missiles); Colombia (transport planes and there are 
reports of combat planes on order); Ecuador (air-to-air missiles, combat 
planes) and South Africa (patrol boats, refueling aircraft, surface-to-surface 
missiles and rifles). 
</P>
<P>
Small customers are Haiti (Uzi submachine guns) and Zaire (small arms), and 
Israel's government has reportedly embarked on efforts to expand sales to Third 
World countries engaged in hostilities. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently 
hinted that sales to Iran, which is recovering from its costly war with Iraq, 
are under consideration. But Muslim Iran considers purchases from the Jewish 
state taboo. 
</P>
<P>
Press reports indicate that Israel's recently renewed diplomatic ties with 
Ethiopia include supplies of arms to that country, which is trying to put down 
a tenacious revolt by separatists.

4 FIRMS SEEK CONSORTIUM FOR NEW SPACE PLANE; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE FIRMS HAVE LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE PROJECT. THEY NOW SAY 
COOPERATION RATHER THAN COMPETITION WILL BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
The four aerospace firms developing the National Aero-Space Plane, which will 
take off like an airplane and fly into space at 25 times the speed of sound, 
proposed Tuesday to end their competition and form a consortium to jointly 
undertake the $5-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic move, which must be formally approved by federal agencies, comes 
amid budget pressures that led the government last year to stretch out the 
program's schedule by 2 1/2 years. In addition, contractors have incurred 
multimillion-dollar losses on the program because government funding has not 
covered all their costs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Rockwell International's unit in Downey, McDonnell Douglas and 
General Dynamics would jointly develop the airframe of the hypersonic craft, 
also known as the X-30. A separate team made up of Pratt &amp; Whitney and 
Rockwell's Rocketdyne unit in Canoga Park would develop the exotic propulsion 
system, known as a supersonic combustion ramjet engine. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell International, which stands to capture roughly 40% of the program if 
such a consortium is formed, was selected by the group to be the program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
A national office to coordinate and manage activity at five plant sites around 
the nation is expected to be located somewhere in Los Angeles County, sources 
said. Barry Waldman, a 26-year Rockwell veteran, was named program director for 
the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have attacked the program because they say it lacks a clear purpose. 
However, the Air Force believes that a hypersonic vehicle could be used as a 
bomber, reconnaissance vehicle or as a high-speed interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents also say that the technology could be transferable to a commercial 
passenger plane, but one that would operate at only two to three times the 
speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace analysts said the distant payoff on the X-30 program has made 
contractors reluctant to invest more money in it, especially as it faces the 
risk of further budget reductions. At the same time, the X-30 technology is 
likely to be shared within U.S. industry, preventing any one company from 
holding a future edge. 
</P>
<P>
"This program has a really long time frame, if it comes to fruition at all," 
said Paine Webber analyst Jack Modzelewski. "The National Aero-Space Plane is 
expensive, and companies are unwilling to go it alone." 
</P>
<P>
Modzelewski estimated that Rockwell is investing $10 million annually and the 
other three contractors lesser amounts. If the government accepts the 
consortium proposal, then the program could be run on a break-even basis, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The first flight of the X-30 is scheduled for 1997, and the first flight into 
space orbit in 1999, but those dates are widely regarded as optimistic, given 
the formidable technical challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The program has a work force of about 5,000, including workers in government, 
academia and private industry. Rockwell has 250 workers on the project at its 
Downey facility and an equal number in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of a consortium has been under discussion within the industry 
since last summer, when it became apparent that the program faced an uncertain 
financial future and formidable foreign competition in hypersonic technology. 
European and Japanese space agencies have their own plans to build hypersonic 
craft, utilizing much of the same technology. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the U.S. approach to have contractors compete, foreign nations have 
emphasized teaming and technology sharing. Even though the U.S. firms believe 
that they have a sharp lead over rivals, they believe that a cooperative 
approach will be most effective from now on. 
</P>
<P>
"Between our government and our contractors, we will see the best of 
everybody's configuration," said Sam Iacobellis, executive vice president at 
Rockwell. "Aerospace leadership will be more and more of a prerequisite for the 
U.S. to be a superpower."

Poland Cannot Meet Interest Payments: Poland said it cannot meet first-quarter 
interest payments on its commercial bank debt because of balance of payments 
difficulties, British bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, with foreign debts of about $40 billion, should have paid about $180 
million on its medium-term rescheduled debt in the first quarter of this year. 
But it has missed a $70-million payment that was due Monday, the bankers said. 
Poland owes Western commercial banks $9 billion, of which about $1 billion is 
in short-term trade credits.

The International Trade Commission has ruled that certain South Korean 
telephone equipment being sold on the U.S. market at less than cost was 
injuring American firms, paving the way for the imposition of duties on 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
The vote cast on Monday was tied at 3-3, but the commission voted in favor of 
the plaintiffs, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp., based 
in Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department investigators had found earlier that the equipment was 
being dumped and imposed temporary duties pending a finding by the ITC, an 
non-governmental body that monitors adherence to U.S. trade law. 
</P>
<P>
Similar anti-dumping duties were imposed in November on small business 
telephone systems and subassemblies shipped from Japan and Taiwan after the ITC 
found firms in those nations were also selling equipment at less than fair 
price. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean firms, led by Samsung and Goldstar, sold about $58 million worth 
of the equipment in the United States in the first six months of last year.

ROCKIES TOP U.S. AVERAGE IN INCOME GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE FIGURES REFLECT STRENGTH IN MANUFACTURING AND MINING, AND A 
SLOWDOWN IN DEFENSE INDUSTRIES IN NEW ENGLAND.

<P>
Personal income growth in the Rocky Mountain region topped the national average 
for the first time in six years in the third quarter of 1989, while it slowed 
in New England, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said the Plains states registered the fastest growth rate, 
9.2%, followed by a 9.1% advance in the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
The department said Rocky Mountain income in the July-September quarter grew 
8.7% over the same period of 1988, compared to a national growth rate of 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Rockies registered above the national average since 
1983 and reflected increasing strength in manufacturing and mining, the 
department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department said income growth in New England declined 
during the third quarter to an 8.2% rate from an 8.6% rate in the second 
quarter and 9.6% in the first. 
</P>
<P>
The deceleration was blamed on slowdowns in the growth of construction and 
service payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
Joining New England with growth rates below the national average were the 
Mid-Atlantic region, up 8.4%; the Southeast, up 8.3%; the Southwest, up 8.2%, 
and the Great Lakes, up 8.1%. 
</P>
<P>
And, because of the effects of Hurricane Hugo last September, South Carolina 
posted the first decline in any state's non-farm personal income growth since 
Nebraska and North and South Dakota recorded negatives in the fourth quarter of 
1988 at the end of that year's drought. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina the hardest, also affected income 
growth in neighboring states because of extensive damage to rental properties. 
Excluding the effects of the storm's damage, personal income would have 
increased 9.4% in South Carolina and 8.9% in the Southeast region. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph E. DePass, an economist for the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said 
automation has replaced much of the antiquated durable manufacturing and mining 
infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain region, making those industries more 
efficient and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, New England, which in recent years had built up defense-related 
high-tech industries, has been hit by the slowdown in defense spending. In 
addition, he said, there is a shortage of skilled workers in the region because 
of high-priced housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, DePass said New England still has a relatively high growth rate 
compared to other regions. 
</P>
<P>
The Plains income growth was attributed to rebounding farm income after the 
drought and to strong durable and non-durable manufacturing. In the Far West, 
the report said, growth reflected strength in manufacturing, service industries 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in both the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions, weakness 
in durable and non-durable manufacturing dampened growth. Weakness in motor 
vehicle production in Michigan particularly affected the Great Lakes region, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest suffered slow growth in payrolls of most major industries, with 
advances in service industries slower than in any other region. 
</P>
<P>
States with the fastest growth in personal income were: North Dakota, 16.9%; 
Alaska, 15.3%; South Dakota, 13.4%; Nevada, 13.3%; Washington State and Hawaii, 
11.1% each; Utah, 10.6%, and Minnesota, Florida and Iowa, 10.3% each. 
</P>
<P>
States with the slowest growth, in addition to South Carolina, were: Wyoming, 
5.4%; West Virginia, 6%; Oklahoma, 6.8%; Arkansas, 6.9%; Michigan, 7.2%; 
Louisiana, 7.3%; Nebraska, 7.4%; Kansas, 7.5%, and Ohio, 7.6%.

Ford Deferring Merit Raises: Ford Motor Co. announced that it was deferring 
first-quarter merit pay raises for 55,000 salaried workers in the United States 
to cut costs in a soft and unpredictable auto market. 
</P>
<P>
The move "is a recognition that the future is somewhat uncertain because of 
weak auto industry sales and slowing economic growth, along with an 
increasingly competitive environment," the company said. Ford's move follows 
one by General Motors Corp., which said this month it plans broad cost cuts 
designed to save more than $1 billion. Ford did not say how much it expected to 
save with the program but added that it was part of an effort to cut costs and 
increase efficiency.

LOOKING AHEAD: BUSINESS TRAVEL WILL FUEL SUPPORT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY H. WILLARD, TIMOTHY H. WILLARD is managing editor of the Futurist, a 
publication of the World Future Society in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business travel is expected to increase rapidly during the 1990s. Futurist 
Marvin Cetron expects the principal reasons to be population growth and the 
integration of a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
Most business travel will continue to be done by airplane, with passenger 
counts growing from 380 million in 1985 to almost 800 million by the end of 
this decade. To cope with demand, airplanes that can carry as many as 1,000 
passengers may be used by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, flight delays are expected to grow as airports struggle to handle 
large numbers of flights. Look for businesses such as shopping malls, movie 
theaters, exercise clubs, even office facilities rented by the hour to spring 
up in easily reached locations around airports, capitalizing on travelers whose 
flights have been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate travelers will increasingly use their own aircraft, creating a 
greater market for small jets. In Britain, Chichester-Miles Consultants Ltd. 
has developed a jet with a body of glass-reinforced plastic that is less than 
25 feet long yet seats four people. It will be available in the early 1990s and 
will have a cruising speed of 500 m.p.h. and a range of 1,700 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the next century, laser-powered spacecraft could send travelers into 
orbit and halfway around the world in less than 45 minutes. Researchers at 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predict that this sort of craft would provide 
the most efficient form of passenger flight transportation. An unmanned vehicle 
will likely be tested by 1995, and a manned craft could be operating 
experimentally shortly after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporations Behind More Programs to Educate Workers 
</P>
<P>
U.S. businesses fret over the future supply of literate, trainable and 
technologically adept workers. The nation's high school dropout rate is 
projected at 28% in the 1990s, and many of those who do graduate may lack an 
adaptable education. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses increasingly will form partnerships with local governments to 
improve education efforts -- in effect, to "grow" the workers they will need. 
Already, joint business-government efforts are planned or are under way in 
various parts of the country for education programs for children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
In Mississippi, a partnership between government sources, IBM and Richard 
Riordan, a Los Angeles philanthropist, will put computer learning centers in 
every kindergarten and first grade in the state. Children will be taught to 
read and write using these computers, and in the process they will develop 
basic computer skills. More than 70 of an expected 523 computer learning 
centers have already been installed. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations are also founding and funding degree-conferring schools that 
provide training appropriate for the workplace. These institutions attract high 
school students by providing free tuition, job placement and a high level of 
instruction. These aren't small, single classroom facilities; IBM operates a 
veritable campus at its headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., and through its worldwide 
seminars instructs 22,000 students a day. Herbert London, dean of New York 
University's Gallatin division, the so-called school without walls, predicts 
that "it is only a question of time before the corporate BA is perceived as a 
direct competitor to the conventional college degree." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture This: Possibilities for Video Are Wide Open 
</P>
<P>
As the popularity of video continues to grow, new business applications for 
videotaping and videocassette recorders will be developed. VCRs are now found 
in nearly half of all American homes and will increasingly be found in offices 
and other business settings in the 1990s. The number of in-office video 
cameras, studios and production facilities is also expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
"Video letters" may become a popular means of business communication in the 
1990s. Brief videotapes could be sent in place of letters, resumes or short 
business presentations, adding the visual dimension to communications. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Short Takes Inc., a video products firm, has developed "video booths" 
where consumers can tape short, inexpensive video letters. The user purchases a 
videocassette, steps inside the booth, inserts the tape into a slot and 
proceeds with the taping -- much like the conventional still-photo booth. Users 
can see themselves on a monitor in the booth and direct the action of the 
video. Video booths have been installed in hotels and retail locations, with 
office building installations expected soon.

Disposable Diapers: The Arizona company that makes TenderCare disposable 
diapers is developing a flushable diaper. RMed International reports that it 
has come up with a product called TenderSoft that can be flushed in a toilet 
like other degradable wastes. Procter &amp; Gamble abandoned a similar product 
in the 1960s after tests showed consumers were more apt to throw it away than 
flush it. Now, with the world's growing ecology consciousness, P&amp;G or 
Kimberly-Clark may be ready to try the idea again. Cleveland Plain Dealer

Corporate Cleanup: Payless Drug Stores Northwest and the Fred Meyer drugstore 
chain have started programs to increase recycling and reduce waste at the 
corporate level. Payless is pushing its people to recycle 98% of their paper. 
It will also set up recycling stations for employees to drop off household 
materials. Fred Meyer says it will tell customers about environmentally 
friendly products, stock more of them and use office cleaning materials that 
break down easily. Portland Oregonian

Healthy Hospitals: Traditional general hospitals soon may be a thing of the 
past, according to creators of popular new hospitals in south Florida. While 
still providing most general services, the hospitals tout themselves as 
specialists in sports medicine, gynecology, emergency care and other fields. 
Older hospitals in south Florida and elsewhere may have to fall in with the 
trend or lose business to the newcomers. South Florida Business Journal

Nonstop Competition: Some regional airlines are thriving in the shadow of big 
competitors. Midwest Express, based in Milwaukee, is determined to compete with 
Northwest Airlines on Western routes. It is adding two MD-88s to its fleet of 
11 smaller DC-9s and by mid-March will carry passengers nonstop to San 
Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. In contrast, Texas-based Conquest 
Airlines shuns competition with the major carriers and concentrates on routes 
between the state's smaller cities. Conquest believes that it will break even 
this year, a feat for a 2-year-old airline. Houston Chronicle, Milwaukee

Price Hitches: Frozen Food Express, a trucking service in Dallas, has been

HILTON TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES TO SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hilton Hotels Corp. said Tuesday that it will consider restructuring 
alternatives other than the much anticipated sale of the company, sending its 
stock sharply lower on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton's stock closed down $8.75 at $65.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. It had traded as high as $115.50 a share after the company put itself 
on the block last August. 
</P>
<P>
After trading closed, William Lebo, the company's general counsel, said Hilton 
had received a takeover proposal, but he declined to reveal details. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of the lodging and casino company have spiraled downward in recent weeks 
as prospects have faded that it would be sold at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had estimated that Hilton could fetch as much as $130 a share. The 
company has about 48 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
In its earlier announcement Tuesday, Hilton said its board next week "will 
consider a number of alternatives for the company, including proposals to 
acquire the company, as well as restructuring strategies which would not 
involve a sale of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no assurance that the company will elect to pursue any of those 
alternatives," it added. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton issued its statement in response to inquiries by the New York Stock 
Exchange. The company's stock had fallen sharply before the announcement, and 
trading was halted briefly because of an imbalance of orders. 
</P>
<P>
"My interpretation is that there's a big difference between what may be coming 
in on the bid side and what Barron (company Chairman Barron Hilton) thinks is 
the proper ask side," said Marvin Roffman, analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chicago-based JMB Realty 
Corp. was offering about $90 a share. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday traders said a rumor that JMB had dropped out of the bidding was 
a factor driving Hilton's stock down. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Glazov, executive vice president for JMB, declined comment. JMB has never 
confirmed that it was a bidder for Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives to a sale include declaration of a special cash dividend or other 
measures.

They say Chrysler's poor performance underscores the dreary state of the U.S. 
auto industry in 1989, a year in which sales were strong for much of the period 
but then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
They said Chrysler could report a loss of as much as $280 million, or about 
$1.20 a share, in the final three months of 1989, due mainly to more than $300 
million in writeoffs from staff cutbacks and a plant closing.

A new domestic drug control strategy to be announced by President Bush Thursday 
will designate Los Angeles County, Houston, Miami, New York and the 
U.S.-Mexican border as high-intensity drug trafficking centers eligible for 
special aid, according to Administration and congressional officials. 
</P>
<P>
The designation of high-intensity regions, including the border area from San 
Diego to Brownsville, Tex., is one element of the Administration's drug control 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of the plan, which Bush is expected to announce in a White House 
ceremony, are likely to include a new call for widened death penalty provisions 
for drug dealers and new rules that will allow Customs agents to assume the law 
enforcement powers of Drug Enforcement Administration agents. 
</P>
<P>
But the high-intensity designations are likely to attract the greatest 
attention. Such designations have been under consideration within the 
Administration since drug czar William J. Bennett took office last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, actually picking the areas to be named has been difficult, in part 
because of intense lobbying by local officials from around the country eager to 
obtain the designation and the extra law enforcement funds they expect to come 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and his aides have been trying to downplay the significance of the 
designations. "It's not an honorarium or an award," Bennett has told officials 
in meetings around the country. 
</P>
<P>
And Administration officials point out that, at least for this year, the 
designations will carry only limited amounts of additional money -- roughly $25 
million spread among all five areas over the next nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to lower expectations," one official said. "There's not a lot 
there. When you spread it over five areas, $25 million doesn't go too far." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the official noted, various government entities in Los Angeles 
County estimate that the drug problem costs the area roughly $2 billion 
annually, increasing budgets for everything from police to prisons to treatment 
centers and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to the $25 million immediately available, the federal drug 
control strategy envisions a substantial increase over the next two years in 
the number of federal prosecutors and drug agents assigned to the five 
designated regions. The result will be "a much higher percentage of federal 
resources for these areas," said one source familiar with the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Because the jurisdiction of the federal agencies spills across local 
boundaries, regions surrounding the designated areas are also likely to 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when the government formally designates Los Angeles County as a 
high-intensity drug area, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles will 
receive additional prosecutors. But those prosecutors will be free to work on 
drug cases from throughout the federal Central District of California, which 
includes Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Santa 
Luis Obispo counties in addition to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Imperial counties will be designated as part of the Southwest 
border high-intensity region. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress directed the Administration to consider six criteria in 
deciding which areas to designate. Included were the amount of local resources 
spent on drug control, the seriousness of each area's drug problem and the 
degree to which each area's drug problem has an impact on other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not decided how to divide the money among the five areas. 
Federal authorities plan to meet with state and local officials after the 
designations are made to work out a plan for using the added resources. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug strategy includes several elements designed to reduce 
bureaucratic confusion in drug enforcement. One such provision involves the 
powers of Customs agents. Originally, Customs officials had wanted all of their 
roughly 2,600 agents to be given the full powers of a Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent. After DEA objections, Bennett developed a compromise 
under which 1,000 Customs agents will be "cross-designated." DEA will have some 
supervisory authority, but not "heavy-handed DEA controls," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only about 190 Customs agents are cross-designated to handle the 
drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug strategy provides also for a national drug intelligence center to 
be housed at the Justice Department -- to end what critics view as the 
haphazard collection and ineffective processing of drug intelligence by various 
federal agencies now. 
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, an arm of the Justice 
Department that channels funds to state and local law enforcement agencies for 
experimental and innovative programs, will receive a sharp budget increase to 
fund such efforts in the drug field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPENDING ON DRUG CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County alone annually spends $1.4 billion on drug control efforts. 
Here are the estimated 1989/90 costs:

BUSH EXPECTED TO CALL FOR PLANTING BILLIONS OF TREES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush is expected to unveil a national tree planting campaign next 
week, proposing the government join private citizens and businesses in planting 
billions of trees to beautify communities, combat erosion and fight the 
greenhouse effect, Administration sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, calling for $175 million in federal spending during the upcoming 
fiscal year, will be offered as part of an "America the Beautiful" initiative 
which will also include increased funds for government land acquisition and 
protection of national parks and forests, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Details will be made public when the Administration budget is sent to Congress 
on Monday, and perhaps will be embellished in Bush's State of the Union speech 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were generally reluctant to comment on the initiative until 
they see its details. 
</P>
<P>
But George M. Woodwell, director and founder of the Woods Hole Research Center 
in Massachusetts, said it appears to only be "a useful palliative, a mere 
palliative." To have an impact on the greenhouse effect and the warming of the 
Earth's atmosphere, he said, the over-arching problem of fossil fuel use must 
be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the plan said it will call for the government to support 
the forestation of lands endangered by erosion and the creation of "energy 
parks." 
</P>
<P>
While the program will be carried out largely by the Agriculture Department's 
National Forest Service, it has been pushed by the Environmental Protection 
Agency as an element of a pollution prevention strategy and as a step to fight 
the greenhouse effect largely caused by the emission of carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also intends the program to be a message to Third World 
countries where the massive destruction of forests makes a substantial 
contribution to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. U.S. criticism of rain 
forest destruction has been met by charges that the United States is guilty of 
destroying its own forests by encouraging timber exports. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's initiative comes as private groups and organizations such 
as the American Forestry Assn. have already made successful strides in 
increasing reforestation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates are that 2 million trees have been planted in the last two years, and 
there has apparently been a small gain in acreage in forests, but data on tree 
harvests is scanty. 
</P>
<P>
The new Administration program has been under consideration for months. The 
American Forestry Assn. has urged that efforts be focused on urban and 
community programs, and the planting of trees for windbreaks, shelter belts and 
along stream channels. 
</P>
<P>
Under present programs, the Forest Service spends about $20 million per year on 
reforestation of public lands and supporting tree planting as part of the 
Agriculture Department's soil conservation efforts. In addition, as much as $35 
million a year is available from a trust fund supported by tariffs on forest 
products, and is used to protect and enhance existing timber stands. 
Altogether, about 490,000 acres are replanted by the government annually.

LABERINTO, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the banks of the Madre de Dios River, men dream of the mother lode but 
scratch for a few grams of shiny dust. Golden butterflies shimmer in the air, 
but tarantulas as big as a fist lurk for the unlucky. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they stay only for a 90-day contract or linger for years, Peru's jungle 
gold miners soon abandon hopes of big strikes and happy endings. Life is as 
brutish as the midday sun in the upper reaches of the Amazon Basin. 
</P>
<P>
For the government of Peru, too, the Amazon frontier has lost much of its sheen 
as the font of solutions to the nation's chronic miseries. A tangle of 
realities has conspired to make the jungle's riches as elusive as its imagined 
El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is Peru's inability to plan and control its destiny as apparent as in 
this ramshackle riverside smuggler's haven, carved out of the jungle hillside 
in the province whose name means Mother of God. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of gold fever, and not much else," said clerk Lourdes Medrano 
in Laberinto's town hall, a bare-plank, two-room office on wooden stilts. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, Laberinto has grown to 600 families and serves as base for 
perhaps 2,000 registered miners who work the sandy banks of the broad, muddy 
river as it winds down from the Andes and on to Bolivia and Brazil. There are 
streetlights fed by occasional electricity, but no phones or even radio or 
television signals. 
</P>
<P>
The town's two rutted streets are cluttered with cafes and shops in brightly 
painted clapboard sheds. The Texas Cafe and Laramy's are popular places to sit 
on a wood bench and sip a beer. Every kiosk, every street vendor, appears to be 
in the gold business. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the government is supposed to be the final purchaser of all gold mined 
in Peru. In reality, even the managers of the government Miner's Bank admit 
that they obtain only 10% to 20% of the gold found in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority is contraband, sold illegally to buyers from across the 
borders or from Lima, the capital. Nearly all the considerable mineral riches 
from Peru's Amazon, which makes up 60% of the nation's land area, are 
vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nearly 100% flight; nobody sells to the government," said Sixto Yamoca, 
the exasperated part-time mayor and full-time schoolteacher. Exploitation, he 
adds, is rife. 
</P>
<P>
"The miners don't pay their workers well, they employ children, they don't feed 
them sufficiently," Yamoca said. "Sometimes they treat them very badly and 
don't even pay them at the end of their 90-day terms. They say that the worker 
broke something; they seek any pretext." 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, the miners bring the town a modicum of prosperity when they come 
to town to buy supplies, drink and sell their packets of gold dust at a 
makeshift market at the river's edge, a virtual gold fair. 
</P>
<P>
Yamoca, 31, said that after five years in Laberinto, he is thinking of 
returning to his hometown in the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people want to earn their money and run; they don't care whether 
we prosper," he said. "To stay is not pleasant. We are isolated; we are very 
depressed economically." 
</P>
<P>
Gold mining in the Amazon, a tradition in Brazil, is expanding in the tributary 
rivers of surrounding countries nearer to the Andes, the source of the gold. 
The closer the mountains, the richer the deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, mercury is used to separate the ore from the sand. There are few 
studies, but concern is growing over the potential damage to the waters from 
mercury contamination, given the near-complete absence of government 
supervision. American ecologist Tony Luscombe, based in Lima, estimated that 70 
tons of mercury are used in gold mining in the Amazon each year. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mercury is also putting a powerful poison into the atmosphere. 
Miners heat the already volatile liquid metal to make it bond with the ore. In 
doing so, they breathe in the toxic fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing worries are being voiced, too, over the erosion that the mining 
causes as it evolves from simple river panning to more sophisticated 
operations. As the river beaches have been worked out in the two decades of 
mining, leading to reduced output, miners have turned to carving out the river 
banks themselves and to river dredging. 
</P>
<P>
As a visitor travels upstream, west from Laberinto, on a three-foot-wide, 
30-foot-long dugout canoe powered by a Yamaha outboard motor, the shoestring 
mining operations come into view. Shacks for owners and workers are set on 
higher ground, with the jungle crowding against them; below are the pitted 
banks, where workers dig out the gravelly sand with shovels and load it into 
wheelbarrows in 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Some miners rely on old-fashioned panning, but others use wooden sluices, on 
which workers filter the ore through gauze or burlap screens, washing it with 
river water raised by gasoline-powered pumps. At one site, thousands of 
brilliant butterflies coated the sand like a soft blanket. 
</P>
<P>
Laborer Hernan Quisbi, glistening with sweat, said he began work at 5 a.m. each 
day and worked eight straight hours, until the heat became unbearable. He 
earned 7,000 intis a day, about $1.20, more than he could get in his native 
uplands province of Apurimac, and more than most miners pay. 
</P>
<P>
On a neighboring site, foreman Eduardo Mamani Bedoya, 37, complained that the 
invasion of miners has lowered the take substantially in the five years since 
he arrived. With his team of eight, he mines 2.5 to 3 grams of gold a day. That 
is worth $25 to $30 officially or $25.80 to $31, no questions asked, on the 
black market. Like many miners, he has cleared some of the jungle to grow 
vegetables to help himself get by. 
</P>
<P>
In the rainy season, Mamani said, the river shows its power, suddenly rising as 
much as 23 feet and submerging the entire site. A stain in the red soil 
revealed the high-water mark halfway up the steep cliff on a bend in the river. 
When it rises, he and his family of five flee further into the jungle to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
It is this annual flooding that makes mining possible, bringing the gold 
downstream, churning up the banks and enriching the soils for farming. Colonist 
farmers have settled many small tracts along the river and the parallel dirt 
highway to Cuzco in the uplands, to the consternation of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Madre de Dios province, an area of 30,000 square miles, remains among the 
wildest regions in the Amazon Basin, with just a handful of large plantations 
and ranches -- in part because gold has distracted attention from such 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Sihuay Liudo, who oversees Laberinto's branch of the Miner's Bank, has 
the frustrating job of trying to reap some of the profits for the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Illegal buyers are everywhere," he said. "And the judges and prosecutors are . 
. . involved in buying. We have raided the buyers, we take their scales, but 
the prosecutors do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are close to applying brute force," he continued. "We are also trying to 
reach the miners to show them we will support them with equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The bank has a shop that sells Briggs &amp; Stratton motors, picks and hoes and 
other gear, at reduced prices. Still, hardly anyone sells gold to the bank. The 
government has raised its price to near that of the black market, still with 
little success. There appears to be no apparent effort to police the business. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Maldonado, the provincial capital, is two hours' drive east of Laberinto 
on the back of a two-ton pickup truck stuffed with as many as 25 passengers. 
There, regional mining bank manager Maximiliano Yaguas vents his anger as much 
at the government as at the miners. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most suffocating things that impedes growth here is centralism," he 
said. "Almost all the decisions are made in Lima, and they don't make 
decisions. When they do, they don't take into account the local factors and 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
"For 25 days last month, we didn't have any phone service. They just fixed it. 
How can we make decisions without communications?" 
</P>
<P>
Yaguas insists that the miners are fooling themselves in thinking they do 
better on the black market because "the illegal merchants use doctored scales 
and cheat the miners." 
</P>
<P>
So the gold escapes, the province loses its 3% gold tax "and that's why Puerto 
Maldonado is like it is. I am waging this fight so that there will be paved 
roads, clean water, good schools. But put simply, the authorities have not been 
interested in seeing that this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Maldonado, founded in 1902, has crept to a population of 22,000, while 
across the border in Brazil the frontier towns have mushroomed and modernized. 
In this capital of a district that is only slightly smaller than the state of 
South Carolina, there are virtually no private cars because the roads are so 
bad. The trip on the dirt road to Cuzco in the Andes, the only land connection 
to the rest of Peru, takes two days in good weather and up to two weeks in the 
rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
Hailing a cab means flagging down one of the town's many 50-cc motorbikes and 
hopping aboard. Lately, progress has come in the form of pedicabs, homemade 
motorbike contraptions with a bench above two rear wheels. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 book on the province by the local development corporation estimates the 
loss of revenues from gold contraband at $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
With proper planning and control, the region could harvest its rich reserves of 
Brazil nuts, natural latex and other resources without causing serious 
ecological damage, the study contends, if gold were not such a fixation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with the kind of optimism often still accorded the Amazon, the book adds: 
"It's not an exaggeration to say that the 'conquest of the east' is a sine qua 
non for the self-sustaining development that our country urgently needs." 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Sosa, a lawyer and local commerce booster who settled in Puerto 
Maldonado from highlands Ayacucho 14 years ago, said gold has pulled people 
away from more permanent, but less immediately profitable, development. The 
region's whole mentality is one of extraction, he said -- of gold, of 
hardwoods, of rubber -- and every man for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it is all corruption," he said. "Things get done when money changes 
hands. There is no control at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sosa favors the kind of agricultural development common in adjacent Acre 
province in Brazil, and he scoffs at environmentalists' fears of destroying the 
rain forests and damaging the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Acre is the site of major cattle-ranching projects, where natural rubber 
tappers are confronting ranchers and where tapper-conservationist Chico Mendes 
was killed. It has suffered less deforestation, so far, than other provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Juan Aguirre Perez, the town's first native-born mayor, shares Sosa's 
view. Each December, he said, "we have to throw tons of mangoes into the river 
because they fall and create a health hazard. Imagine what a business we could 
do if we had a processing plant to make jams or can the fruit? 
</P>
<P>
"Before this gold fever arrived, agriculture was developing well. But when gold 
was found, the fields were abandoned. And we are poorer than ever," he said. 
"The future of Madre de Dios must be agriculture and ranching. Coffee grows 
here like a bad weed. But if we plant, how do we get it out of here?" 
</P>
<P>
As the accessible gold reserves dwindle, halting attempts are being made to 
improve the mining technology. In the past two years, river dredgers have begun 
to be used. Now they number no more than 20 or 30, compared with thousands in 
Brazil and hundreds in Bolivia downstream. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, a few companies have moved upstream into old riverbeds, long 
since dry after river-course changes. In the hilly jungle, they are using 
machinery to strip off yards of accumulated topsoil to get at the buried 
alluvial deposits. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of operation, mining bank manager Yaguas said, holds the potential 
for earning serious money. But the areas are inaccessible, the costs high. 
</P>
<P>
Both the dredging and the stripping of old beds could increase the hazards of 
erosion and silting-up of the river, said veteran miner Salvador Pardo. 
</P>
<P>
He has recently added a mercury collector system to his mining operation, in 
which the mercury vapors do not escape into the atmosphere. It is not only 
safer and cleaner, but cheaper, since he can recapture the mercury. A number of 
miners are following suit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pardo complained that miners are offered few options in the Amazon region. He 
sought government help to plant mango and Brazil nuts, but the local 
agricultural station had no seedlings and no advice. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Garcia, an adviser to a native Indian association, said uncontrolled 
gold mining and other development has disrupted the lives of many of the 4,000 
or so natives who live in the forests and along the riverbanks. 
</P>
<P>
"This population has come under tremendous pressure from all the interest 
groups here in the last 20 years," he said. "Gold has been an important impetus 
in this process, causing conflicts with the indigenous peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich Helberg, who works on health problems with the dwindling number of 
native communities in Madre de Dios, said gold was not a serious ecological 
problem when it was simply pick-and-shovel work. "But now that it is becoming 
more technical, and they are mining the old beds, this is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our problems here are more of social control, though, not 
technological," Helberg said. "When you start projects and then abandon people 
there without control, of course the problems are going to be exacerbated. 
</P>
<P>
"The local shamanist traditions here say that illness is closely allied to 
personal behavior. You could say that the problems in this part of the Amazon 
are a reflection of just that."

RESTORE ORDER SWIFTLY, IZVESTIA TELLS GORBACHEV 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was warned Tuesday by the government 
newspaper Izvestia that he must act swiftly to restore order in the Soviet 
Union's strife-torn southern republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia if his reform 
policies are to survive. 
</P>
<P>
In stark, almost unprecedented terms that underscored the major challenge 
facing Gorbachev, Izvestia said his conservative opponents could use a failure 
in Azerbaijan and Armenia to reverse much of the liberalization that has 
occurred in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Society today has come close to the point where the question arises: Is there 
to be perestroika or not?" Izvestia's parliamentary observer, Vyacheslav 
Shchepotkin, wrote. "Millions of people have cast their lot with perestroika, 
irrevocably placing their hopes on it. That is why we tell the head of state -- 
act now!" 
</P>
<P>
The explosive situation in the two southern Soviet republics is widely seen as 
the most serious crisis Gorbachev has faced in his five years as the country's 
leader, and the Izvestia commentary makes clear that his policies, and even his 
leadership, may well be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sporadic fighting continued Tuesday in the Azerbaijani capital of 
Baku. Azerbaijani militias -- armed with weapons stolen from police and 
military depots -- threatened a "real guerrilla war" against the Soviet army 
units and internal security forces sent to restore order if they are not 
withdrawn within two days. 
</P>
<P>
"Azerbaijan is on the edge of the abyss where lie chaos and anarchy," the 
Azerbaijan branch of the KGB, the Soviet security and intelligence 
organization, said in an appeal for calm broadcast on Radio Baku. The radio 
described the situation as "very, very tense." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Interior Ministry reported that two soldiers and a woman bystander 
were killed when gunmen ambushed a military convoy carrying demobilized 
soldiers and the families of officers out of Baku. 
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes continued Tuesday around the city's Salyansky barracks, where 
mutineers from the local garrison and a military school have seized a building. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its powers under the state of emergency proclaimed in Baku last Friday, 
the army has made little progress in reasserting the central government's 
authority in the republic beyond taking up positions around key installations. 
In its reports Tuesday, the Soviet press suggested that Moscow waited too long 
before deploying troops there. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll stands at 91, including 18 soldiers and members of their 
families, since the government sent the army in early Saturday, according to 
the Interior Ministry. In the week before that, 72 people were killed -- most 
of them Armenians who died in pogroms in the city's Armenian quarter. 
</P>
<P>
More casualties have been reported in Armenia and in outlying areas of 
Azerbaijan, but comprehensive figures have not been provided for these places. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers already are "more and more often being chosen as targets" by the local 
militias, Maj. Gen. Yevgeny Nechayev, a ranking officer in the internal 
security forces, told the official news agency Tass on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku's port, meanwhile, captains of 50 Soviet oil tankers, drilling rigs and 
other ships reportedly threatened to blow up their vessels if the Soviet army 
is not pulled out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city itself was paralyzed by a general strike called by the Azerbaijani 
Popular Front, the principal nationalist group in Baku, and all shops were 
closed, all factories shut and no newspapers published. 
</P>
<P>
But workers turned up for political meetings at many large enterprises, 
according to activists, and the agenda of those rallies included debates on the 
country's political future and the disbandment of local Communist Party groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani Parliament warned Monday that unless the Soviet troops are 
withdrawn, it will begin the process of secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
This brought a call for political dialogue and compromise from Nechayev, who 
said that the Azerbaijan Popular Front appears to have broad support, while 
"individual terrorists" are to blame for the continuing clashes. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that we have to launch a dialogue with these organizations," 
Nechayev said. "We have to find compromises. We have to pursue our common 
aims." 
</P>
<P>
The commentary in Izvestia stressed a return to "the dictatorship of the law" 
while resolving the current crisis. Public disillusionment with Gorbachev and 
with perestroika could result from inept handling of the crisis, Izvestia said, 
expressing the concerns of those progressives who support Gorbachev's program 
of political, economic and social reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be admitted that a certain part of the population is beginning to 
blame democratization for contempt toward the law, the increasing crime rate 
and the economic and inter-ethnic strife," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, while mounting this criticism, efforts are being made to direct it 
against the head of state, the initiator of perestroika. This is dangerous. The 
mood of the masses skillfully guided in a certain direction could be used 
tomorrow by some individuals for whom the main idea is to return the country to 
its pre-perestroika days." 
</P>
<P>
While Izvestia did not identify those who might move against Gorbachev 
politically, the Soviet leader is certain to face tough questions at an 
upcoming meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The 250-member committee will discuss ethnic issues and a new party platform 
that Gorbachev had planned as a means to broaden and accelerate the reform 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani Communist Party's Central Committee is scheduled to meet today 
to discuss the crisis there. 
</P>
<P>
Activists from the Azerbaijani Popular Front have set a deadline of today for 
the withdrawal of the Soviet army from the city. But Soviet news reports 
Tuesday suggested the troops will be there for weeks and probably months. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani attacks on Armenians continue and have spread to Russian 
families in Baku as well, according to reports in the Soviet press. Noting the 
growing hostility toward Russians following the army's move into the city, the 
trade union newspaper Trud commented, "Even bread is denied to ethnic Russians 
in Baku shops now." 
</P>
<P>
Two ships evacuating the families of army officers were stopped by small boats 
manned by the Azerbaijani militia, who wanted to ensure that bodies of those 
killed in the fighting were not aboard. None were found. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops began to unblock roads in the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, according to Tass. Although populated by Armenians, the 
region is part of Azerbaijan and has been the focus of tension between the two 
Soviet republics for more than two years.

5 KILLED AS FOG CAUSES 19 PILEUPS NEAR FRESNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy tule fog near Fresno caused 19 pileups on California 99 Tuesday morning, 
including one in which five people were killed when two vehicles exploded in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
The accidents left dozens of injured lying on the roadway median strip in a 
scene that resembled a battle zone, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare," said CHP Officer Laurie Johnson, who said that more than 
40 vehicles were involved in separate accidents along a two-mile stretch of 
highway through the town of Selma, about 15 miles south of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst of the chain-reaction collisions, a man, a woman and two children 
were killed when their vehicle slammed into a Foster Farms tractor-trailer rig 
and burst into flames, according to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The car was in turn hit by a pickup truck, which also caught fire, killing the 
driver, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fresno County coroner's office identified those killed in the car as Javier 
Villarreal, 23, of Cantua Creek, Ana Lilia Guzman, 21, of Fresno and her two 
children, Perla Guzman, 2, and Ivan Villarreal, 8 months. Javier Villarreal was 
the father of Ivan. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup was identified as Mike Hosford, 28, of Clovis. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said a man involved in another accident near the fatal wreck had to be 
restrained to keep him from rushing into the flames in an attempt to rescue 
Hosford, who was trapped and screaming in the burning pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said a total of 30 people were hurt in the pileups. The injured were 
placed on the highway's median strip, where rescue workers ran from victim to 
victim, pinning them with identification tags and treating those most in need 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the vehicles involved in collisions were traveling at up to 65 m.p.h. 
despite a fog that limited visibility to 50 feet and despite Highway Patrol 
warnings to drive slowly, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Doyle, 20, of Dinuba said civilians were not the only ones to exceed a 
safe speed in the fog. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle was forced to stop on the highway north of Selma because of a wreck, he 
said, and when he looked in the rear-view mirror he saw a Selma police car 
skidding into him. 
</P>
<P>
After he was hit by the police car, Doyle said, he got out of his vehicle and 
tried to push it off the highway. Another car knocked it onto the median strip.

REAGAN'S TAPED TESTIMONY URGED FOR POINDEXTER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration argued Tuesday that former President Ronald Reagan 
should be permitted to testify on videotape if he must give evidence in the 
Iran-Contra trial of former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Justice Department and Reagan's personal attorney argued that 
Reagan should be excused entirely, they maintained that a videotape appearance 
would be preferable to forcing a personal appearance, in part because the tape 
could be edited if Reagan inadvertently blurted out national secrets. 
</P>
<P>
But Poindexter attorney Frederick Robinson called the videotape plan a 
"blatantly inadequate" substitute for a defendant's right to call witnesses of 
his own choosing. Poindexter is scheduled to go on trial next month on five 
criminal charges resulting from the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Harold H. Greene said he would rule later on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greene told Poindexter's lawyers to submit the specific questions 
they would like to put to the former President. Greene said that a list of 67 
subjects which defense attorneys gave him earlier was "far too opaque" to 
permit him to decide if the questioning was necessary to Poindexter's defense. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing of almost two hours, Robinson argued that Reagan was the only 
person who could corroborate Poindexter's version of what transpired when 
Reagan and Poindexter met during the months before the Iran-Contra affair began 
to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
But Asst. Atty. Gen. Douglas Letter and Reagan's lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, 
said presidents have a right to maintain the confidentiality of private 
conversations, particularly those that concern national security or relations 
with foreign nations. They noted that no President or former President has ever 
been compelled to testify over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1807 that a President can be 
called into court when Aaron Burr, on trial for treason, sought the testimony 
of President Thomas Jefferson. He said the ruling was applied to President 
Richard M. Nixon during the cases that resulted from the Watergate scandal in 
the 1970s. Despite the rulings, however, something always intervened to prevent 
a President from actually appearing in court against his will. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people have said that (a President may be compelled to testify), but 
nobody has ever done it," Greene reminded Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"That is correct, your honor," Robinson replied. "It only means that you will 
have the opportunity to do it first." 
</P>
<P>
Greene told Poindexter's lawyers to prepare their specific questions by 
Thursday. He said that if he decides to order Reagan to testify, either in 
person or on videotape, defense attorneys would be permitted to ask follow-up 
questions not on the list but would not be allowed to introduce new subjects.

2 SENATORS CALL FOR EPA IN CABINET

Two senators proposed legislation Tuesday to elevate the Environmental 
Protection Agency to Cabinet-level status, saying it would assure that the 
government gives the environment the priority it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) would 
change the name of the EPA to the Department of the Environment and allow the 
EPA administrator to regularly attend Cabinet meetings with the President. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush reportedly is leaning toward supporting the idea but he has 
resisted expanding the Cabinet in the past, saying it could become unwieldy. 
However, Administration officials say the political benefit of highlighting the 
government's environmental commitment could override such reservations.

BENTSEN SETS HEARINGS ON SOCIAL SECURITY TAX; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: REPUBLICANS CHARGE THAT THE DEMOCRATS' PROPOSED $55-BILLION REDUCTION 
COULD SET OFF A 'TAX-CUT BIDDING WAR' BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

<P>
Reserving judgment on a Democratic proposal to cut Social Security payroll 
taxes by $55 billion a year, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen 
(D-Tex.) on Tuesday scheduled hearings on the politically tantalizing 
legislation in early February. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said there was growing 
support for the measure despite strong condemnation from President Bush and a 
new attack launched by House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
One GOP opponent -- Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) -- said the legislation could touch 
off a "tax-cut bidding war" between Democrats and Republicans that would add to 
the federal budget deficit and require future tax increases to offset the 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor of the tax cut, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), formally 
introduced the bill Tuesday as one of his colleagues, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings 
(D-S.C.), predicted it would receive speedy approval if it comes to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan has proposed cutting Social Security payroll taxes by as much as $600 
per person to provide tax relief to the nation's wage earners and to prevent 
the government from using the Social Security surplus to reduce the size of the 
federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen praised Moynihan for dramatizing the rising burden of Social Security 
payroll deductions on low-income and middle-income Americans, but said he 
wanted to find out if the legislation would lead to future cuts in retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said the Moynihan plan would do much "to strip the fig leaf from the 
budget chicanery" that allows the growing surplus in the Social Security trust 
fund to make the federal deficit appear smaller. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservative Texan said Congress should "not necessarily" adopt the 
proposal before it receives answers to the many questions raised about the 
impact of the tax cuts on the payment of benefits in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Sen. Moynihan has proposed a kind of fiscal surgery here," Bentsen 
said. "Like any surgery, that can be dangerous. . . . I don't know whether Sen. 
Moynihan's proposal can keep Social Security and the budget healthy, but I 
propose to find out." 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee scheduled hearings for Feb. 5 and Feb. 8 on Moynihan's 
legislation, which has put the Bush Administration on the defensive as the 
second session of the 101st Congress begins. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats intend to contrast Moynihan's plan for lowering payroll taxes on all 
wage earners with the President's proposal to reduce the income tax on capital 
gains, which would channel most benefits to upper-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Republicans, however, pictured the New Yorker's proposal as "tinkering" 
with 1983 changes in Social Security financing that were designed to assure 
payment of benefits to the Baby Boom generation when its members retire after 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Michel, in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.), whose panel has jurisdiction over the retirement program, said 
Moynihan's proposed tax cut was a "dangerous adjustment which could inspire 
even more drastic threats to the system and ultimately bring it down." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that Moynihan's proposal 
underscored the fact that the Social Security surplus is being used to mask the 
size of the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important for us to find a means either to see that these 
funds are appropriately invested and saved for the future retirement of the 
Social Security contributors, or in the alternative, to adjust the tax to what 
is necessary to provide for the current requirements," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Moynihan's bill, the basic Social Security tax rate would be rolled back 
from 6.2% to 6.06%, effective last Jan. 1, on all wages up to $51,300 a year. A 
second reduction to 5.1% would take effect next Jan. 1 on all wages up to an 
adjusted ceiling estimated at $54,300. 
</P>
<P>
Individual savings under the proposal would depend on the amount of income, 
with a maximum $600 reduction next year.

President Vaclav Havel said Tuesday that when he visits Washington and Moscow 
next month, he will propose that the next superpower summit be held in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats had no immediate comment on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Parliament, Havel also proposed a number of changes, including 
dropping "Socialist" from the country's official name. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the word 'socialism,' nobody knows what it means any more. What is 
more, it provokes general resentment. Today it symbolizes the totalitarian 
system of the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Havel suggested that the country be known simply as the Czechoslovak Republic. 
</P>
<P>
In further moves to rid the new political system of the vestiges of Communist 
rule, Havel also proposed a new state emblem to replace the existing one, which 
bears a Communist star above the Czechoslovak two-tailed lion. He proposed a 
shield bearing the traditional emblems of the Czechoslovak federation, in which 
the star above the lion would be replaced by a crown. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament, meanwhile, passed a law giving independent political parties the 
right to exist. About 35 new parties have sprung up since Communist rule was 
effectively ended in December, though they had no legal basis now. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who was elected president by the Parliament Dec. 29, has pledged to lead 
the country until its first free elections in 40 years, scheduled for June 8.

U.S. ASKS CURBS ON GIVING SECRET DATA TO NORIEGA

Federal prosecutors asked the judge in the Manuel A. Noriega case Tuesday to 
impose strict procedures for releasing sensitive documents about the deposed 
Panamanian leader's past involvement with the CIA and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In a new court filing, government lawyers said many records classified "Top 
Secret" will be sought by defense attorneys and "could reasonably be expected 
to cause serious damage to the national security of the United States" if made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecutors did not specify how the files could harm U.S. national 
security, their legal brief sounded the most ominous note to date in view of 
Noriega's expected defense that his alleged drug trafficking was condoned by 
U.S. intelligence agents for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Bush Administration officials had said that they had nothing to 
fear from any disclosures that Noriega might make. 
</P>
<P>
But the court filing signed by Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael P. Sullivan said at 
one point that "the unauthorized disclosure and uncontrolled dissemination of 
such information would cause exceptionally grave damage to the national 
security." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he was referring to documents that might be provided not only to 
Noriega's defense team but also to lawyers representing several co-defendants 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
He complained, for example, that the attorney representing former Noriega pilot 
Daniel Miranda had filed legal papers "seeking to disclose certain information" 
about the reputed ability of the U.S. National Security Agency to intercept 
telephone conversations and other communications in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Michael O'Kane, once a U.S.-appointed lawyer with the Panama 
Canal Commission, responded that a supposedly secret National Security Agency 
facility was public knowledge, being identified on a city map printed in the 
Panama City telephone book. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, who will preside at Noriega's trial, 
took the government's request under advisement. Hoeveler so far has established 
no firm procedures for handling classified information. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sullivan said that Hoeveler should promptly issue a "protective order" 
setting up such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"In anticipation of additional requests (besides O'Kane's) for disclosure of 
classified information, the government is conducting a search of the files of 
the Central Intelligence Agency and other government agencies," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sullivan did not mention former White House aide Oliver L. North by 
name, his legal brief asked Hoeveler to promulgate rules under the Classified 
Information Procedures Act similar to those established last year by U.S. 
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who presided over North's conviction on three 
of 12 felony charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell had directed that all secret files in the North case be kept in a 
heavily guarded government repository where defense attorneys could examine the 
records to determine which ones were relevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a related drug-trafficking case, an attorney for Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid 
charged Tuesday that the former officer in Noriega's Panama Defense Forces is 
being "caged in a tiny cell" most often used to punish difficult prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid is expected to be pressured by federal prosecutors to become a 
government witness against Noriega.

A white substance found wrapped in banana leaves in a house in Panama 
frequented by Manuel A. Noriega was not cocaine as the Army believed, but a 
material used in voodoo, the Pentagon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bonding material," said a Defense Department spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy 
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a substance they use in voodoo rituals." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Army's Criminal Investigation Division -- which conducted tests on 
the material -- would not immediately identify the substance other than to 
describe it as "bonding material." There was speculation that it was flour or 
cornmeal used in making tamales. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 22, Army Col. Mike Snell, the commander of a U.S. infantry task force, 
told reporters that his troops had found 50 pounds of cocaine in a house 
frequented by Noriega at Ft. Amador, a military base used jointly by U.S. and 
Panamanian forces before the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story building was inhabited by a Brazilian woman believed to be 
Noriega's "sorceress."

ANOTHER SAD CHAPTER FOR ARMENIA; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC STRIFE: FUNERAL DIRGES REPLACE MARTIAL MUSIC. YEREVAN MOURNS THOSE 
KILLED IN THE FIGHTING WITH AZERBAIJANIS.

<P>
The nationalist music that filled the air last week when hundreds of Armenian 
volunteers went off to fight Azerbaijanis has been replaced by the traditional 
music of mourning as Yerevan honors its dead. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths, along with the blockade of the railway into Armenia and the 
resulting shortages, brought a quick end to the exuberance Armenians felt when 
the volunteer militias marched off. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until this point, it was like it was a play," Araik Papian, 35, said as a 
funeral procession made its way past his home. "We did not understand that we 
are in a real world. Now we do." 
</P>
<P>
The people of Yerevan seem to be weeping not just for their dead but also for 
themselves as a nation. They are not just learning the reality of war but are 
living another chapter in their sad history. 
</P>
<P>
Artavazd Khatchikyan, 20, a senior at Yerevan State University, told a visitor: 
"I was standing in the street the other day, looking at a puddle, and I was 
thinking that all my life I have heard about the horrible massacres of 1915 (a 
reference to Turkey's attacks on Armenians). I always said, 'Oh, that's too 
bad,' but it was so distant. Now, I feel the horror. I stand on a street and 
look at that puddle and feel that I am going to be pushed right in." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, four of Khatchikyan's friends took a bus to the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
border to fight. They had one shotgun among them. Khatchikyan, who did not go 
because he was sick with the flu, said he worries about his friends and wishes 
he were with them. He said he is no longer able to keep his mind on his 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenia All-National Movement, which recruited heavily among university 
students for its militia, appears to have enough volunteers for now. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, a group of students were sitting in an upstairs cafe, 
watching a funeral procession for one of the fallen. His name was Yervand 
Sahoumian, he was 32, and until his death the previous Friday, he was just a 
man from Yerevan with nothing that set him apart from the others. But now 
everyone in Yerevan knows Sahoumian's name. It is heard on the radio, and his 
funeral procession was seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
The procession was led by a truck with Sahoumian's plain wooden coffin on the 
open bed. A soldier marched alongside, carrying a portrait of the dead man. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sad feeling for everyone," Vera Mouradian, 50, said as she walked 
along a few yards behind the coffin. "It makes no difference whether he is our 
son or not. He is the child of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
At least four men from Yeraksh are believed to have been killed this week in 
the fighting. In a sense, the number is small, but the psychological impact has 
been substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to find some force in your soul just to stay young, to not become 
mentally disabled like the old men here," Khatchikyan said in the cafe. "I want 
to think about girls, fun, the things young men think about. But I can't just 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Armenian syndrome, a kind of feeling that everyone is against you. 
It is very hard to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, Zare Papian was watching television in a darkened room. 
Papian, 28, is a painter. He says he is not a political man, that he prefers to 
worry about colors and canvas and how to find good Georgian wine. 
</P>
<P>
But now he spends much of the time following the news. He is out of paint, and 
because of the blockade, he cannot buy any more. He says he could not paint now 
anyway, that it does not seem important. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand this whole situation," Papian said. "It is very difficult 
for us now. We don't know what is to become of us." 
</P>
<P>
The blockade has made it worse. There is an acute shortage of fuel, and street 
lights are dimmed to the lowest level or simply turned off in order to use the 
minimum of electric power. Electric signs that normally advertise restaurants 
and cafes are dark. Many homes are without heat. 
</P>
<P>
Television programming normally begins at breakfast time, but now there is no 
television until 7:30 p.m. People are being discouraged from switching on 
electric stoves even to heat water for tea. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is fear that Soviet troops might move into Yerevan as they did at 
Baku, in Azerbaijan, to re-establish the central government's authority. Over 
the weekend, military convoys moved through the streets of Yerevan and 
helicopters could be heard landing at the airport.

SENATE DEBATE OPENS ON NEW CLEAN AIR BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<P>
The long-awaited debate on cleaning the nation's air began in the Senate 
Tuesday with Majority Leader George J. Mitchell arguing that the benefits of a 
Senate proposal outweigh the high cost. 
</P>
<P>
The Maine Democrat, inaugurating what is expected to be a long and vigorous 
debate, acknowledged the Bush Administration's concern about the cost of the 
Senate's voluminous 587-page rewrite of the 20-year-old Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
But citing statistics implicating air pollution in tens of thousands of deaths 
annually, Mitchell argued that "we must protect the health of Americans. . . . 
This bill should pass because the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of 
action," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's comprehensive and far-reaching version of a new Clean Air Act is 
significantly tougher in the controls it would impose on industry than the 
legislation President Bush sent to Congress seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although its provisions to control acid rain are similar to those proposed by 
the President, the Senate bill incorporates much more stringent limits on 
automobile tailpipe emissions to reduce urban smog and tighter restrictions on 
the release of toxic chemicals blamed for an estimated 50,000 cancer deaths a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, attempting to strike a balance between its new environmental 
priorities and the business interests with which the Republican Party 
traditionally has been affiliated, has called some of the Senate bill's tougher 
provisions "excessive." Bush, in letters to Senate leaders last week, also 
hinted that he may feel compelled to veto any legislation that he considers 
"unreasonable or unbalanced." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration estimates it will cost the nation $40 billion annually to 
implement the Senate's bill -- or roughly twice what it figures its original 
clean air proposals will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and the two other chief backers of the bill, Sens. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.) and John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), all took to the floor Tuesday to dispute 
the Administration's cost estimates as inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Baucus cited a recent study by the American Lung Assn. that estimates the cost 
of health care associated with air pollution at $100 billion per year. Mitchell 
argued that the bickering over costs ignores the more fundamental "human" value 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the dollar value of a human life? What is the dollar value of a 
child's health? I ask each senator, what is the dollar value of your child's 
health?" Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost controversy, stirred by industry lobbyists who are mounting a major 
campaign to weaken the Senate bill, was expected to be only one of several 
contentious issues as both the House and the Senate debate new clean air 
legislation at the floor level for the first time in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues include whether to mandate the use of alternative fuels to reduce 
ozone pollution, how strictly air toxics should be regulated and whether 
Midwestern states, which will bear the brunt of the bill's acid rain control 
costs, should be given some form of cost-sharing subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he expects the Senate debate to take several weeks, with key 
votes not likely until next week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
The somewhat weaker version of clean air legislation under consideration in the 
House is not expected to go to the floor for several weeks.

COMMUNITY: SOUTH-CENTRAL RESIDENTS VENT THEIR FEELINGS ON THE STREET AFTER 
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES SHOOT A NATION OF ISLAM MEMBER TO DEATH.

Four men stood in front of a corner liquor store, eyeing the police tape and 
Sheriff's Department cars lining 106th Street, remnants of an incident that 
left one man dead, another wounded. And in frustration, they echoed a chorus of 
black rage that resounded from one end of the block to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"People are tired of being beat up and shot at," said one 39-year-old man who 
has spent his entire life in South-Central Los Angeles. "A lot of us feel we'd 
rather die and go to hell than accept this." 
</P>
<P>
The news traveled by word of mouth, fact mingled with rumor, anger clouded by 
disbelief. "They shot him seven times," one said. "In the back," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Cox, 30, gazed at a poster in an apartment window promoting the upcoming 
visit of Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. "I heard Farrakhan is going to come 
down here and make his speech in the middle of the street," she said. "That's 
the word." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents had been up all night, kept awake by the sound of 
helicopters and squad cars blaring down their street after a sheriff's deputy 
shot to death a 27-year-old member of the Nation of Islam and wounded another 
during an altercation after a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors clustered Tuesday -- in their front yards, on the sidewalk, 
around a puddle of blood spilled during the incident and left to dry in the 
morning sun. They were angry, and sad, and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to feel," said Johnnie Johnson, 30. "Everybody feels the 
same way. They just get tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the shooting, five sheriff's cars remained on the street. Orange 
cones blocked cars traveling down Vermont Avenue, and yellow tape marked the 
spot where the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they're doing now, they're going to have to face the wrath of the 
people," one man said. "I feel this ain't nothing but a police state." 
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old woman named Ann said she saw the incident from her apartment 
window. "We just heard the poor man shouting for mercy," she said, shaking her 
head. "They were steady beating him." 
</P>
<P>
"They could have used a stun gun," said Don Franklin, 30. "They too damn 
trigger-happy for me. 
</P>
<P>
"If they shoot one of them," Franklin said, "what makes you think they won't 
shoot one of us?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Welcome Sight 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said they could not keep the graffiti off the buildings or the 
drug dealing off the street before the Nation of Islam came along. They were a 
welcome sight, in their characteristic suits and bow ties, always courteous, 
always respectful. 
</P>
<P>
"Those Muslims recruited those gang-bangers who were selling dope and put them 
in suits," Ann said. "They cleaned those boys up, taught them to respect 
themselves. I don't know what caused this, but I know what the Muslims did for 
our neighborhood. They cleaned it up." 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here nine years," said Cox, mother of a 10-year-old. "When they 
were over there selling dope, nobody got killed. Put suits on them, and 
(sheriff's deputies) kill them." 
</P>
<P>
The sound of gunshots put fear in one mother's heart. "I have five sons of my 
own and a daughter," said Ruthie Collins, 47, whose grown children live around 
the corner from her. "As soon as I heard the shooting, I got on the phone to 
make sure they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary. . . . They killed this man and wounded another and they can sit 
there and drink coffee and eat doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, deputies milled about, completing their field investigation, 
while Nation of Islam members snapped photos of the scene from an apartment 
house balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they were made to feel as though they had done something wrong, 
unable to get to their homes without showing identification, unable to leave 
because their street had been barricaded. Gwendolyn Cain and other neighbors 
wondered if their treatment would have been different had they lived in Beverly 
Hills -- or been another color. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let us leave," said Cain, 27. "I had to miss work because of 
something they did." 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the street seemed to return to normal. The tape was gone, the cones 
had disappeared, and most of the residents had gone about their daily business. 
But the blood on the sidewalk still remained. As did the anger. And the 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"They (deputies) know they messed up," said Cox, turning to go inside her home. 
"They're used to a slap on the hand, but I don't think so this time. They're 
going to have to explain this one."

City officials searched Tuesday for the identity of a homeless man who police 
said was beaten to death on a subway platform in an altercation with a man 
returning home from a movie with his 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Sumter, a 39-year-old plumber, was charged with manslaughter and 
released without bail. Police said that on Sunday night the homeless man spat 
toward the Sumters, then took a swing at the elder Sumter and missed. A fight 
started and police said Sumter began pummeling the other man.

Upholding the broad right of journalists' access to public records, the state 
Court of Appeal on Tuesday ruled that Gov. George Deukmejian must turn over his 
daily appointment calendar to a Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy opinion, Justice Frances Newell Carr rejected Deukmejian's 
argument that records showing details of the governor's schedule are exempt 
from the California Public Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
Carr said the exemption claimed by the governor was so broad that it would 
include "virtually every written item in the governor's office" -- including 
the annual budget that he is required to send to the Legislature each year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unanimous ruling of the three-member panel, Deukmejian would have to 
turn over his daily calendar to a Superior Court judge. Reviewing the documents 
in private, the judge could block the release of any information that posed a 
security threat to the governor. But everything else would have to be 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deukmejian press secretary Robert Gore said the governor intends to 
appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Gore added that Deukmejian would withhold any further comment "until he had a 
chance to read the opinion and analyze it." 
</P>
<P>
Times Deputy Managing Editor Noel Greenwood applauded the appellate court 
decision. "We are pleased with the ruling," Greenwood said. "We have always 
believed that these materials are public record." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Times Mirror Co., which publishes The Times, filed suit against 
Deukmejian after the governor refused to release his daily calendars dating 
back to his inauguration in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The calendars provide an account of Deukmejian's activities as governor -- 
listing the people he met with on official business and the location of each 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian contended that he did not have to disclose the documents. He 
argued that he was not required to release his calendars because of an 
exemption in the Public Records Act for the governor's correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
In what the appeals court described as "a battle of dictionaries," The Times 
and the governor disagreed on what the act meant by "correspondence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debating Definitions 
</P>
<P>
The Times relied on Webster's dictionary, which defines correspondence as 
"communication by letters; also: the letters exchanged." The governor used a 
Black's Law Dictionary definition: the "interchange of written communications." 
</P>
<P>
The court sided with Webster's and rejected the law dictionary definition, 
saying that "it simply covers too much." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also argued that release of his calendars would compromise his 
personal security. 
</P>
<P>
A Sacramento Superior Court judge agreed with Deukmejian. The judge said he had 
a special concern about the governor's security, noting that his ruling on Nov. 
22, 1988, came on the anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
But while noting that the security question was a serious one, the appeals 
court ruled that "a mere assertion of possible endangerment" was not enough to 
outweigh the public interest in access to the records.

KINGS REMAIN IN RUT WITH TIE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES IS 1-6-2 IN ITS LAST NINE GAMES AFTER FINISHING IN A 3-3 
DEADLOCK AT VANCOUVER.

<P>
The Kings got the first look at their future Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It looked a lot like their past. 
</P>
<P>
In their first period since trading Bernie Nicholls to the New York Rangers 
last Saturday in a bid to shore up their defense, the Kings gave up three goals 
to the Vancouver Canucks, the second worst team in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Tomas Sandstrom, one of the two players obtained in the trade, became 
acclimated and the Kings came back to salvage a 3-3 tie before a sellout crowd 
of 16,123 at the Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It's a start. Sandstrom, playing on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Mikko Makela, 
contributed one assist. 
</P>
<P>
The other new King, Tony Granato, sat out with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Tomas played extremely well," Gretzky said. "He's got exceptional 
speed. I think he's going to create a lot of openings for me. Besides that, 
he's a pretty big boy and he plays aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings (21-21-6) are ahead of only Vancouver (14-27-9) in the Smythe 
Division. They had won four of the five previous games against the Canucks, the 
other also ending in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks scored first after Trevor Linden dug the puck out from behind the 
net. Petri Skriko wound up with it in the slot and the fifth-best goal-scorer 
in Canuck history put the puck past goalie Kelly Hrudey at 9:05. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings tied the score, 1-1, at 10:25 on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky passed to Sandstrom at the blue line. Sandstrom whipped the puck to 
John Tonelli in the left circle. Tonelli, spotting Brian Benning open near the 
right post, got the puck to him through two defenders. That left Benning with 
an easy five-foot shot for his sixth goal. Half of those have come on power 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom later marveled about playing with Gretzky, the greatest scorer in 
league history. "I've just got to get open," Sandstrom said, "because he'll get 
you the puck. It's unbelievable to play with a guy like that. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure, I was nervous. It takes a while to get used to playing on a new 
line." 
</P>
<P>
At 14:14, Vancouver moved back into the lead after Marty McSorley lost the puck 
behind the Kings' net. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bozek recovered it and slid it to Ronnie Stern in the slot. McSorley 
skated furiously back to his defensive post, but he got there an instant too 
late, Stern putting in his first goal of the season in this, his 10th game. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver added to its lead at 17:16 when Vladimir Krutov, a transplanted 
Russian who finished second in the Soviet League in scoring last season, got 
his ninth goal for the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't need much help on this one, carrying the puck across the blue line on 
the right side before scoring on a rising shot from about 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings came back to tie with two second-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller got the first at 3:26 after Vancouver goalie Steve Weeks stopped a 
backhand shot by Bob Kudelski with his glove. Then came every goalie's 
nightmare as Weeks appeared to lose sight of the puck after swatting it up in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, coming in from the right side, had no trouble finding it. Or shoveling 
it past the helpless Weeks for his sixth goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings tied the score when Larry Robinson brought the puck down the left 
side, passed it to Steve Kasper and then got it back to score from about 20 
feet at 11:59, his sixth goal to even the game at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it ended, thanks in large measure to Weeks, who faced 36 shots. 
Hrudey faced 25. 
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Larry Robinson, in the middle of a fight between the two clubs 
late in the second period, was slapped with a game misconduct, resulting in an 
automatic ejection at 18:33. . . . Bernie Nicholls, No. 9 with the Kings, will 
continue to wear that number with the New York Rangers. The number had belonged 
to Ulf Dahlen in New York, but he gave it up for Nicholls. . . . Wayne 
Gretzky's 14-game scoring streak came to an end Tuesday, although he had 
several chances to keep it going. Gretzky missed on one breakaway. On two other 
occasions, he made great feeds to teammates, one to Robinson, the other to 
Marty McSorley. But neither could convert. . . . Both the new Kings, Tomas 
Sandstrom and Tony Granato, arrived in Vancouver Monday in time to practice 
with their new teammates. . . . It was hoped that King defenseman Tom Laidlaw 
would be back on the ice Tuesday night after missing one game with a knee 
injury. Laidlaw tried skating Monday in practice, found he wasn't ready and 
went home for further treatment. . . . Right wing Dave Taylor played Tuesday, 
making his first appearance since being sidelined with a groin injury 16 games 
ago. . . . Center Mike Allison missed his fourth game with a back injury.

AN EARLY LOOK AT THE ALL-STARS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: RODMAN AND PARISH HAVE TALENTS THAT MAKE THEM WORTHY 
CANDIDATES. 
</P>

SAN ANTONIO, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's almost all-star time again, so, based on sketchy information, speculation 
and, in some cases, outright opinion, the following constitute a few humble 
choices as to who should take the floor in Miami Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference: Forwards: Charles Barkley, Philadelphia; Larry Bird, 
Boston; Chuck Person, Indiana; Scottie Pippen, Chicago; Dennis Rodman, Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Rodman. Of course Dominique Wilkins averages more points than 
Rodman. So do Bill Cartwright, Fred Roberts and Jerry Reynolds. So what? Rodman 
changes the momentum of a game without taking a shot. We're already going to 
see the game's best offensive talent. Why not showcase its best defensive 
player? 
</P>
<P>
Told to lose weight and be a model citizen, Person has lost weight and been a 
model citizen for Indiana -- and still scored 20 a night. Pippen has been 
all-around outstanding for the Bulls, finally providing Chicago with someone to 
take the pressure off Michael Jordan. Well, a little. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Catledge (Orlando) has had a fine first half at 20.6 points and 8.7 
rebounds per game, but first-year expansion numbers always tend to be a little 
skewed. We don't want to be cynical, but Catledge was in a contract year before 
signing a six-year pact with the Magic last week. Centers: Pat Ewing, New York; 
Robert Parish, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Parish gets in for no other reason than he got robbed of an appearance last 
season, but his numbers (16.8 points per game, 10.5 rebounds per game, .589 
field-goal percentage) more than back up an invitation this year too. Ewing? 
MVP. Enough said. Moses Malone's numbers are solid as always, but the Hawks are 
treading water and his play is doing nothing to improve the team. 
</P>
<P>
Apologies to Rik Smits (Indiana), Rony Seikaly (Miami) and Sam Bowie (New 
Jersey), playing well, but just a cut below. Guards: Jordan, Chicago; Joe 
Dumars, Isiah Thomas, Detroit; Reggie Miller, Indiana; Jeff Malone, Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars has been the better guard in Detroit and Thomas makes it only because 
Mark Price (Cleveland) missed too many games with injuries early on. Miller has 
been the centerpiece of Indiana's emergence and may be the best three-point 
shooter in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Malone? The conference's third-best scoring guard (23.2 points a game) is 
having a career-best shooting year from the floor. He deserves it, finishing a 
few strides ahead of Ricky Pierce (Milwaukee). 
</P>
<P>
Western Conference: Forwards: Karl Malone, Utah; Terry Cummings, San Antonio; 
Buck Williams, Portland; James Worthy, Los Angeles; Chris Mullin, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Trail Blazers were the league's worst underachievers. With the 
same group of players, Williams's professionalism has rubbed off (as well as a 
few crunching picks and 9.7 rebounds) and the Trail Blazers are chasing the 
Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who would make David Robinson the sole reason for San Antonio's 
turnaround, please note Cummings's 21.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Warriors and Suns have come on of late, but Phoenix's rise seems more 
directly related to Kevin Johnson's return. By this slim margin (and logic), 
Mullin gets the nod over Tom Chambers (25.2 points per game). Centers: Akeem 
Olajuwon, Houston; Robinson, San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Head and shoulders above the competition, Olajuwon has kept a struggling 
Rockets team near the .500 mark. Robinson has launched himself onto the list of 
the top five centers in the game with half a year's work. Guards: Magic 
Johnson, Lakers; John Stockton, Utah; Clyde Drexler, Portland; Gary Grant, 
Clippers; Mitch Richmond, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler has been brilliant for Portland, keeping quiet and letting his play 
speak for him. Grant is one of three players in the league in the top 10 in 
assists and steals; Richmond (22.2 points a game) came on after a slow start. 
The most competitive of spots. Ron Harper (Clippers) would have made it but for 
his knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lo and behold, the former Mr. Fragile, Sam Bowie, is on the verge of becoming a 
down-and-dirty tough guy inside for Bill Fitch and the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
"His low-post game a year from now will be tremendous," Fitch said. "Instead of 
spending an hour and a half each day during the summer working on his strength 
and trying to rehabilitate one of his legs, he can ... work on his low-post 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
Bowie said others always have been in the way to his being the go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at (Kentucky), Melvin (Turpin) played the low post, and I played 
the perimeter," he said. "I go out to Portland and (Kevin) Duckworth's progress 
comes around the way he did. ... Here I'm the (center) and I need to develop 
some low-post moves that come crunch time, regardless of how the defense plays, 
I'll be able to get the shot off." 
</P>
<P>
That's assuming Bowie doesn't break in two by year's end; he's missed the last 
two Nets games with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley, who was suspended Nov. 16 for violating his 
substance-abuse aftercare program, was reinstated by the ASAP Family Treatment 
Program Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to play Friday night against the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley missed 34 games and lost more than $240,000 for failure to adhere to 
his NBA-mandated program. ... 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird tells the Orlando Sentinel that he was asked to be one of the 
participants in the now-unlikely Magic Johnson-Michael Jordan one-on-one game, 
but said no because he thought there would be betting on the event.

THEY'RE SINGING BLUES OVER HULL; 
</P>
<P>
PRO HOCKEY: THE PROSPECT OF LOSING NHL'S LEADING GOAL SCORER DAMPENS SPIRITS OF 
ST. LOUIS FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fans and media in St. Louis are up in arms because the Blues have not yet 
negotiated a new contract with Brett Hull, whose 42 goals lead the NHL and 
constitute more than one-quarter of the team's offense. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern not only that he might go elsewhere in the NHL but that he 
could be a target of a possible new hockey league, something under discussion 
by those who find the NHL's $50 million expansion fee ludicrous. It will be 
remembered that Brett's dad, Bobby, was the player whose defection made the 
World Hockey Association viable in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, who reportedly makes $175,000 a year, said he was ready to sign a 
contract if the club made a solid offer, but the Blues appear willing to wait 
until the end of the season. As his goals mount, he becomes a hotter item and 
therefore a bigger problem for a club with a history of pinching pennies. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't know what the Blues are doing," he said. "I guess both sides 
thought it would be simpler, but by being successful I'm making it tougher for 
them. Obviously they didn't think I was as good as I thought I was. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it in St. Louis and I don't want to leave. I love the people here. I'm 
playing out my option because of money, not because of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Caron, the Blues' general manager, said: "I've talked to him about it and 
he says it's not bothering him. If it was, we'd do something about it. But it's 
making him play better if anything." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goodenow, Hull's agent, intends to complete the negotiations before moving 
full time into his eventual role as executive director of the NHL Players 
Association. He said: "We're not close. It will take a lot of work to get it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Daniel Berthiaume, under fire for allegedly swearing at children seeking 
his autograph, has been traded from the Winnipeg Jets to the Minnesota North 
Stars for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, general manager of the Jets, said Berthiaume's trade was related to 
his off-ice actions. The goalie apologized on television for swearing at 
autograph seekers, then a day later denied the incident took place and said 
management had ordered him to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the team has enough goaltending talent to spare Berthiaume, 23, a 
Quebecois. Berthiaume has played more than three seasons with Winnipeg and had 
44 victories. His record this season in 24 games is 10-11-3 with a goals 
against of 3.72. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Maple Leafs, who did not enjoy a .500 or better season during the 
'80s, are one of the big surprises this season with a 25-22-1 record and the 
league's top offense. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Doug Carpenter received more condolences than congratulations when he 
took the job on Aug. 16, a late date to prepare for the season. But he has 
adapted well, and illness has kept owner Harold Ballard from interfering. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter divided the season into 20-game segments, set realistic goals for 
each and thus far is right on schedule. "This was a 62-point team last year 
and, not having known the club, I wasn't in position to predict where we would 
be," he said. "I came on board rather late, so I had to take a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 20 games were devoted to an awareness of me to (the players) and 
them to me. We started the next 20 in fourth position and our objective was to 
catch Minnesota and St. Louis, which we did. 
</P>
<P>
"The current 20 games we want to move closer to Chicago and put some distance 
between us and the others. We've kind of done that too." 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in the climb is a 6-0 record against St. Louis, a remarkable 
feat in that Toronto has been outshot in every game. Total goals: Maple Leafs 
31, Blues 14. Shots: Blues 239, Maple Leafs 156. 
</P>
<P>
After winning in St. Louis Thursday, 4-1, despite the Blues' 49-27 shot margin, 
Carpenter said: "I'm not concerned about the shots in here because I don't 
think they count them right. We missed the net on some shots and they counted 
them." ... 
</P>
<P>
If Toronto winger Lou Franceschetti had four more unsuccessful shots on goal, 
he would be leading the NHL in shooting percentage. An ex-Capital, he has a 
career-high 13 goals in 42 shots for 31 percent. However, a minimum 46 shots on 
goal are required to be ranked. The leader, Luc Robitaille of Los Angeles, has 
35 goals in 128 shots for 27.3 percent. Of Franceschetti, Carpenter said: "He 
has accepted the role he was given and he's played very well. He's a good 
penalty killer and I like to have him out there at the end of a period. He's 
also a great influence in the dressing room on young people. He's a solid 
performer and he gets those smacks (hard checks) in." ... Edmonton's Jari Kurri 
may make his 10th NHL season the last. He earns about $500,000 a year and wants 
a huge raise the Oilers aren't likely to grant. He is contemplating a switch to 
Switzerland or Italy. ... 
</P>
<P>
Dick Patrick, president of the Washington Capitals, and Craig Patrick, general 
manager-coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, are cousins. Dick recalled that when 
his father, Muzz, coached the Rangers and Craig's father, Lynn, coached the 
Bruins, "Our grandmother always rooted for a tie when the teams played. But our 
grandfather (Lester the legend) solved the problem a different way. He rooted 
for the home team." ... Montreal's power play is last in the NHL at 13.5 
percent. After his Prince of Wales team failed twice with the extra man Sunday, 
Coach Pat Burns said: "Maybe I have a problem on the power play. I'm 21st in 
the NHL and now I'm oh for two with this team." ... The rating for the NHL 
All-Star Game on NBC was 4.4, not exactly Super Bowl class but considered 
reasonable for hockey's first network game in 10 years.

Dallas Maverick forward Roy Tarpley recovered from drug dependency on his own, 
without help from team officials, according to the physician who approved his 
reinstatement to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley, who was left alone throughout his latest suspension on orders of 
Maverick Owner Donald Carter, made the recovery on his own, said Dr. David 
Lewis of the ASAP family treatment center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Carter was taking a tough-love approach," Lewis said. "A person who is an

The frequency of drunk driving arrests among Minnesota Vikings players is more 
a credit to the state's intolerance of drinking and driving than it is a 
reflection of the team's approach to alcohol, general manager Mike Lynn said 
Tuesday.

Lynn's comments came a day after the arrest of Keith Millard on charges of 
drunk driving and speeding.

It was the 12th such incident involving a Viking player in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our players here are any different than on any other team," Lynn 
said. "I'm not saying this in a negative way. Our players have got to 
understand that this is a unique state, and if they go out to a bar and drink 
they better not drive." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn said that if the Vikings were in any other state they probably wouldn't be 
reported to police by bar patrons or bar employees the way they are in 
Minnesota. Three of the team's 12 drunk driving arrests were linked to such 
reports, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, was arrested after an officer 
clocked him at 73 m.p.h. in a 40 m.p.h. zone. He was charged with drunken 
driving after refusing to take a breath-alcohol test.

MORNING BRIEFING: '80S 49ERS, '70S STEELERS COMPARE -- OFFENSIVELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many NFL observers are saying that the San Francisco 49ers of the '80s might be 
the best football dynasty ever. Their competition is the Pittsburgh Steelers of 
the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
How do the teams compare? Former Steeler Steve Furness, an assistant coach 
under former Steeler defensive coordinator George Perles at Michigan State, 
told Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press: 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, they have a lot of similarities to us. They have a great 
quarterback, we had a great quarterback. They have outstanding wide receivers, 
and we had outstanding wide receivers. The running backs shared some 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
"But defensively, I don't think there is a great comparison between us and the 
49ers. Their offense is so powerful the defense doesn't have to play 
traditional defense. (Joe) Montana takes them on a 12-play, 70-yard drive and 
they score. 
</P>
<P>
"They never have to hold the team time after time. Their offense is so powerful 
it's ahead, 7-0, 14-0, 21-7. That's the question I have in my mind. They have 
never been on the field where they had to hold the team repeatedly. We did 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the first Super Bowl called? 
</P>
<P>
No comparison: Nose tackle Fred Smerlas and his Buffalo Bill teammates played 
against both the 49ers and Broncos this season. Smerlas said: "When we played 
Denver, we came out flat as a pancake and we still almost beat them. When we 
played San Francisco, our defense was flying all over the place and playing 
great and they still beat us without Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"Montana makes it all work. He has the greatest vision of any quarterback. He's 
like Larry Bird looking for an open man. Montana can read and deliver better 
than anyone I've ever played against, and I've played against some great ones: 
(Terry) Bradshaw, (Dan) Marino, (Bob) Griese." 
</P>
<P>
Bands of gold: If the 49ers win the Super Bowl, Montana, Bradshaw and former 
Raider quarterback Kenny Stabler will have nine Super Bowl rings and nine 
marriages among them. With a victory, Montana would tie Bradshaw with three 
marriages and four rings. Bronco quarterback Elway has no Super Bowl rings and 
one marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The AFL-NFL World Championship Game.

NEWSWIRE: PERLES TO STAY AT MICHIGAN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Perles, under consideration for a multimillion-dollar contract to coach 
the New York Jets, decided to stay at Michigan State after its trustees 
sweetened his head coaching job Tuesday by also making him athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees' 5-3 vote brought mostly hisses, but some applause, from 
about 300 people at the packed emergency board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very confident in my ability to do both jobs," Perles said in a 
statement. "Of course, you don't run a department by yourself. A strong, 
competent staff is essential to any organization. I have a plan that I hope to 
develop." 
</P>
<P>
Perles said his immediate plans were to take care of football recruiting, which 
ends with national signing day on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Perles, who will assume his new job on July 1, when current Athletic Director 
Doug Weaver retires, will have a one-year trial with no extra salary. Then, the 
board will review his performance and decide whether one person can handle both 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
New Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg will have to keep looking. He had 
interviewed 11 potential candidates, including Perles. Steinberg has also 
talked to current NFL assistant coaches Vince Tobin (Chicago), Bruce Coslet 
(Cincinnati) and Floyd Peters (Minnesota).

MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander, each former Australian Open 
champions, stepped onto the sizzling courts today (Wednesday) hoping to move 
closer to another title. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing them were three young players -- Andrei Cherkasov, David Wheaton and 
Boris Becker -- hungry for their first Australian championships. 
</P>
<P>
The three quarterfinal matches offered a view of some of the dominant players 
of the 1980s and perhaps the key players of the 1990s, the past clashing with 
the future in the first Grand Slam tournament of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the defending champion and No. 1-ranked player, is the oldest in the 
group at 29 and faced the youngest, Cherkasov, a 19-year-old Soviet baseliner 
born on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
Cherkasov, playing in his first Grand Prix quarterfinal last year, gave Lendl a 
tough time before losing 6-4, 6-4 on clay in Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good match for me," Cherkasov. "I think it was the best in my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the 1985 and 1987 Australian champion now ranked No. 3, took on a 
stranger in Wheaton, a 20-year-old with a powerful serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the only quarterfinalist not to drop a set in his first four matches, 
tuned up for the meeting with a five-set doubles match in the 140-degree 
courtside heat Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, from Lake Minnetonka, Minn., made it to the quarters by beating No. 5 
Aaron Krickstein, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton may have been a little lucky to get so far -- with Krickstein slowed by 
a pulled groin and third-round opponent Mark Woodforde retiring in the second 
set with a sprained ankle -- but is widely regarded as one of the top young 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Wilander, winner of the Australian in 1983, 1984 and 1988, has 
been struggling the past year. He faced the toughest of the young players, the 
22-year-old, second-ranked Becker, winner of three Wimbledon titles and the 
U.S. Open last year. 
</P>
<P>
Becker won six of their previous eight matches, losing only on the clay at the 
French Open. In their last meeting, in the Davis Cup final in December, Becker 
trounced Wilander, 6-2, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarterfinal match pitted 12th-ranked Yannick Noah of France against 
Mikael Pernfors, the Swedish-born former NCAA champion at Georgia who benefited 
from the default of John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
Noah, who beat Lendl en route to winning a tuneup event in Sydney, won both his 
previous matches with Pernfors in close matches, once on clay in 1985 and 
another on hard courts in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The heat at this $3 million tournament Tuesday turned the stadium into the 
world's largest sauna and tested the fortitude of the top players. 
</P>
<P>
If there were an award for durability, it would go to the winners of the 
longest doubles match in Australian Open history -- South Africans Pieter 
Aldrich and Danie Visser, who outlasted Americans Scott Davis and Robert Van't 
Hof in a five-hour, 29-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich and Visser's winning score was 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 23-21. 
</P>
<P>
The match, which began in the hottest part of the day and ended in the balmy 
evening, was 19 minutes longer than a five-set, 84-game marathon won two years 
ago by Andrew Castle and Roberto Saad against Glenn Michibata and Grant 
Connell. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped a lot that the sun went down later in the match," Visser said. "We 
started feeling cramps because we were losing a lot of liquid. When the sun 
went down we stopped sweating so much." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier women's quarterfinal matches, top-seed Steffi Graf defeated Patty 
Fendick, 6-3, 7-5; No. 6 seed Mary Joe Fernandez beat Zina Garrison, 1-6, 6-2, 
8-6; West Germany's Claudia Porwik beat Angelica Gavaldon, 6-4, 6-3, and No. 4 
seed Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia defeated Bulgaria's Katerina Maleeva, 6-4, 
6-3.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
In the middle of his second season as coach, you begin to get the impression 
that Jim Harrick is the best thing to happen to UCLA basketball since John 
Wooden. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gene Bartow had rabbit ears. Gary Cunningham didn't really want to coach. Larry 
Brown had wanderlust. Neither Larry Farmer nor Walt Hazzard won enough to 
satisfy high expectations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Solid. That's Jim Harrick. Twelve wins, three defeats. A conference 
championship contender. An exciting, fast-breaking style. Renewed fan interest. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Harrick has brought Tracy Murray along perfectly. He didn't 
rush the hotshot freshman from Glendora High, who is now contributing heavily 
as a starter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sellouts for Oregon State Saturday and DePaul on Feb. 3 at Pauley Pavilion 
already have been announced, and the March issue of Sport magazine is about to 
hit the newsstands with a story proclaiming the "Bruins Are Back." . . . 
</P>
<P>
There never will be another Wooden, but here is a guy who could very well stay 
on the job longer than the first five coaches combined who followed the Wizard 
of Westwood. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The knockdown Mike Tyson suffered in a sparring session with Greg Page in Tokyo 
probably is meaningless. Most gym workouts are. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, I remember watching a ferocious George Foreman knock a sparring 
partner out of the ring a few days before he did virtually the same thing to 
Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Veteran promoter Don Chargin says Sugar Ray Robinson was the best gym fighter 
he has ever seen and former featherweight champion Raul Rojas the worst. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you were making an instructional film on the art of self-defense, WBC 
bantamweight champ Raul Perez would be your man. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere was in a generous mood this week, signing Jim 
Everett for six years the same day she took out a full-page advertisement in 
The Times to thank the team's fans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Saddest sight in the NBA is Ralph Sampson limping up and down the court. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One good thing about playing for an organization with the history of the Los 
Angeles Clippers is that club records always are within easy reach. For 
instance, the Clippers' best won-loss record since moving to Los Angeles for 
the 1984-85 season was a sparkling 32-50 in 1985-86. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Ron Harper can't make the All-Star Game, how about a spot on the 
Western Conference roster for teammate Charles Smith? . . . 
</P>
<P>
A two-point victory at home over an expansion team (Minnesota) and a 32-point 
loss to a cellar-dweller (Sacramento) tells me the Clippers have to make a deal 
for a guard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers could have had Charlotte guard Dell Curry, who was signed to a 
multiyear contract Tuesday, for Greg Kite last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Four NBA teams with losing records -- Charlotte, Sacramento, Golden State and 
Miami -- have sold out every home game this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Long Beach uniforms that supposedly are gold look more like 
fluorescent pistachio. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We got everything -- including dissertations on Michael Jordan -- except the 
score from ESPN announcers Barry Tompkins and Quinn Buckner on the Long 
Beach-Nevada Las Vegas telecast Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harrington is doing an outstanding job coaching Long Beach, but must he 
also referee every game? . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the most remarkable streaks in sports is Jerry Tarkanian's 73 
consecutive victories in Long Beach -- 63-0 as coach of the 49ers, 10-0 as 
coach of the Runnin' Rebels. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Members of the last college basketball team to have a perfect record -- 
Indiana's 1975-76 national champions -- congratulate Bobby Knight each season 
after the final previously unbeaten team has lost. The calls began coming in 
Saturday after Kansas was beaten by Missouri. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That NCAA proposal to move conversions back to the 25-yard line would have made 
two-point attempts somewhat risky. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I break into a sweat watching five-set Australian Open matches on TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to the rise of the Toronto Maple Leafs is the absence of ailing 
owner Harold Ballard from the front office. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't believe alcohol ranks right up there with drugs as a problem in 
sports should check the police blotter of the Minnesota Vikings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vince Lombardi once called the Playoff Bowl, which used to match the losers of 
the NFL Western and Eastern Conference championship games, "a hinky-dink game 
for hinky-dink teams." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Try telling members of the U.S. World Cup soccer team, who are being paid 
anywhere from $26,000 to $40,000, how much their sport is gaining in 
popularity.

WILANDER HAS A HOT TIME AGAINST BECKER

Three-time champion Mats Wilander upset Boris Becker, as defending champion 
Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg overcame heat, wild winds and eager, young 
opponents today (Wednesday) to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the No. 2 seed, lost to the eighth-ranked Wilander, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, his legionnaire's hat flapping and his groundstrokes cutting through 
winds that knocked over table umbrellas, beat Andrei Cherkasov, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, 
on the partially enclosed stadium center court. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the only hatless player of the day, had to cope with even crazier winds 
on Court One and a more difficult challenger in American serve-and-volleyer 
David Wheaton. The third-seeded player, who warmed up for the match by playing 
nearly four hours in the heat Tuesday, beat Wheaton, 7-5, 7-6, (7-4), 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 fans among the crowd of about 20,000 were treated for heat 
exhaustion, but none were seriously ill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature on the rubber-bottomed hard courts was 115 degrees, down from 
the 140 degrees on Tuesday. But the dry, hot winds of up to 35 m.p.h. played 
havoc with baseline shots. Away from the court, which holds and reflects heat, 
the temperature reached 99 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander whipped strong passing shots by the net-charging Becker, who grew 
increasingly frustrated and finally backed up to the baseline and began playing 
Wilander's style. 
</P>
<P>
Like a crafty counter-puncher taking apart a wild-swinging fighter, Wilander, 
25, calmly took the 22-year-old Becker's measure in a 2-hour 15-minute clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over Becker, who won his third Wimbledon title and first U.S. Open 
title last year, gave Wilander a large dose of satisfaction after his 
straight-sets trouncing by the West German in the Davis Cup finals in December. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had won six of their previous eight matches before Wednesday, losing 
only on the clay at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
The loss by Becker stalled his drive to catch up to No. 1 Lendl, and left him 
wondering about a jinx in the Australian, where he has never gone past the 
quarters in five appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was a hot wind," Lendl said. "It was pretty bad. It's not a nice way 
to play. I didn't want to have to be out there for five sets." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, 20, of Deephaven, Minn., stayed even with Edberg until being broken 
for the first time in the 11th game of the first set on a backhand that drifted 
long and wide in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, pumping his fist after the break in what was for him a big 
demonstration of emotion, served out the set and raised both arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good," he said. "I had to get pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
He then won the first four games of the second set. During the second 
changeover, Edberg was nearly hit when the umbrella-topped table he was sitting 
under went flying. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarterfinal match was to pit 12th-ranked Yannick Noah of France 
against Mikael Pernfors, the Swedish-born former NCAA champion at Georgia who 
benefited from the default of John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
If there was an award for durability, it would go to the winners of the longest 
doubles match in Australian Open history -- South Africans Pieter Aldrich and 
Danie Visser, who outlasted Californians Scott Davis and Robert Van't Hof in a 
5-hour 29-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich and Visser's winning score was 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 23-21. 
</P>
<P>
The match, which began in the hottest part of the day and ended in the balmy 
evening, was 19 minutes longer than a five-set, 84-game marathon won two years 
ago by Andrew Castle and Roberto Saad against Glenn Michibata and Grant 
Connell.

MELVIN DURSLAG: MONTANA, 49ERS LOVE PARIS IN RING-TIME

<P>
Bubba Paris, whose calling is offensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers, had 
a talk the other day with Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Bubba said to Joe: "You will be remembered in history, but it's important for 
you to know I will, too. I have blocked for you eight of your nine years in the 
league. If my grandchildren ask, I have film to prove it. I have played a part 
in your greatness." 
</P>
<P>
You have to assume Montana agreed, because Bubba rises 6 feet 6 inches and 
weighs what is believed to be 340 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't so much, if you want to consider the weight of the USS Ranger, but, 
standing on the doorsill of his third Super Bowl, Bubba could be the heaviest 
entertainer ever to appear in this promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Weight doesn't stop a man from competing," Bubba reminds you. "What stops him 
is bad shape. I am not in bad shape. I am playing better at my weight than I 
did at 290." 
</P>
<P>
He is asked: "Does George Seifert, your present coach, harp on your weight as 
Bill Walsh did?" 
</P>
<P>
"Seifert doesn't watch my weight," Bubba says. "All he watches is what I do. 
That's all my coach should watch." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba not only played for Walsh, who was dedicated to detail, but, a graduate 
of Michigan, toiled for Bo Schembechler, too. 
</P>
<P>
Which leader did he find the tougher? 
</P>
<P>
"Both were very tough guys, but each very different," Bubba says. "I never 
really knew what Walsh was thinking. If he hated me, he never said so. Bo was 
easier to read. He walked around the practice field with a yardstick. If he 
didn't like something you did, he swatted you with it. One time, he actually 
kicked me in the rear. You never had any doubt where you stood with Bo." 
</P>
<P>
You had to concur a boot in the rear divests an issue of any subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Since the day Bo delivered a foot to his hindquarter, Bubba hadn't been kicked 
until the recent playoff game with Minnesota when Chris Doleman, accusing Bubba 
of getting in extra licks, booted him in the groin, an act captured graphically 
for a disbelieving republic on instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
"Did it hurt?" Bubba is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt plenty," he says, "but I wouldn't show it. I would never give Doleman 
the satisfaction he hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, parallels a batsman, struck with a fastball, refusing to rub. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you say anything to Doleman?" Bubba is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I stared at him a minute," he replies, "then said, 'Now why did you do that?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it was a reasonable question. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't answer," continues Bubba. "But four plays later, he apologized. 
That's something Lyle Alzado never did." 
</P>
<P>
"Did Alzado kick you in the groin, too?" we ask Bubba. 
</P>
<P>
"No, he grabbed me there," he says. "I held him on a play. He fell to the 
ground and lay there in ambush. When I walked past, he reached up and grabbed 
me. He was the most horrible player I ever ran into in football. He threw dirt 
in your face. He pulled off your helmet and threw it. I said to him one day, 'I 
can't believe this is the way you are.' He cursed me." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders report that Bubba said to Alzado, "I'll pray for you." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle responded, "I'll pray for you, you . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Raised by a widowed mother in Louisville, Bubba recalls he was trained to 
build, and retain, his self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't allowed in our house to say we were poor," he remembers. "My 
mother, who was a community worker, told us that people who lack necessities 
needn't see themselves as poor. She likened life to a Lamborghini out of gas. 
Without gas, she said, it was still a beautiful Lamborghini." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba's appetite is long established in the San Francisco Bay Area, but he 
hints that reports on his table activities can be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
He has a fondness, for instance, for chicken wings, a victual he is known to 
consume in major quantities. But, he insists, he doesn't eat them as nibblers, 
as some have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"I have them for dinner," he says. "My wife cooks them very special." 
</P>
<P>
How many chickens go to their reward to provide wings for Bubba isn't known, 
but before it becomes a social issue, involving demonstrations in front of the 
federal building, a point can be made in Bubba's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Is it his fault a chicken comes with only two wings? Why hasn't science 
produced a chicken with four? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone hollering Bubba eats too many wings should be thankful he doesn't care 
for liver. A chicken comes with only one.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was Super Bowl media day at the Superdome Tuesday, and Denver wide receiver 
Mark Jackson was holding court from a podium. 
</P>
<P>
"So, what do you think of media day?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"God created media day on Day One," Jackson said. "It's the greatest thing in 
the world. Where would we be without media day? No one would care about this 
game if it weren't for media day." 
</P>
<P>
Another question: "What's the strangest thing you've seen in town so far?" 
</P>
<P>
"Cyndi Lauper," was the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Any reporter hanging around Jackson's podium got a notebook full of quotes. 
</P>
<P>
If the Broncos somehow win the Super Bowl, Jackson is the guy Johnny Carson 
should get on the "Tonight" show. He could do his own standup routine. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I want to see on the first play is a double reverse 
flea-flicker," Jackson said. "Yeah, I'd love to see that. Probably won't, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
On John Elway: "He gets that look in his eyes and starts screaming at you in 
the huddle, and he elevates the whole team to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't have that look (Sunday), I think I'll punch him or run a bad 
route just to get him to start screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want John playing on his heels." 
</P>
<P>
When Jackson played at Purdue, his quarterback was Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim has matured and he's a great quarterback, but he's not the motivator John 
is," Jackson said. "They're two different guys." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was asked, just for fun, to predict the score of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, 28-6," he said. "The 49ers, of course. Shoot, then we wouldn't cover even 
the spread. That (is bad)." 
</P>
<P>
Of 49er receivers Jerry Rice and John Taylor, Jackson said: "You know, we wear 
the same numbers, 80 and 82." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is No. 80, and Vance Johnson, the Broncos' other starting receiver, is 
No. 82. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is No. 80, Taylor No. 82. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good little item, huh?" Jackson said. "I figured that one out myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Rice and Taylor are a lot bigger and faster than Vance and I." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, of course, was purposely being humble. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been practicing," he said. "We've been working on saying things like, 
'Ah, I don't know,' and 'On any given day, anything can happen.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know, they should hold this media day on Monday (after the game) and just 
invite the winners. Then they could talk all the trash they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans dining experience took on a competitive air Tuesday night when 
San Francisco 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo and Denver Bronco owner Pat Bowlen 
found themselves eating in different rooms of the same restaurant, Pascal 
Manale's. 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo fired first, conspiring with a waiter to have a piece of raw chicken, 
covered in garlic, sent over to Bowlen's table. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen, who by this time in the meal had wrapped a napkin around his head, 
looked around to retaliate and had a friend peel a 49er pennant off the wall. 
Not exactly sure how to fold, spindle or mutilate the thing, Bowlen handed it 
to a female companion, who, with Bowlen, walked over to the DeBartolo table and 
wrapped it around the face of a member of the party. "Eat this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative truce was called and both owners left the restaurant laughing. 
DeBartolo, however, remembered to take the pennant with him. 
</P>
<P>
A key for the Broncos Sunday will be the condition of running back Bobby 
Humphrey, who suffered cracked ribs on his right side in the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said his ribs felt fine Tuesday, but he'll know more after today's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
He'll put on a flak jacket and undergo his first contact since the injury. 
He'll also try carrying the ball in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play," he said. "It's just a matter of how much pain I'll have and how 
much I can stand. I'm not going to say I'll be a key factor in the game, but I 
know, as a group, the team is counting on me." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey's backup, Sammy Winder, said: "If he can walk, he'll play. He's a 
tough young man." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers placed fullback Keith Henderson on injured reserve because of a 
pinched nerve in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
If another 49er ends up on injured reserve, Steve Bono, the former UCLA 
quarterback who plays behind Joe Montana and backup Steve Young, will suit up. 
</P>
<P>
As things stand now, Bono is on the 49ers' inactive list, as he was for five 
games during the regular season and both of the 49ers' playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just thrilled to be here," Bono said. "I've got a good chance of picking 
up a Super Bowl ring." 
</P>
<P>
Bono was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers after last season, his fourth in 
the NFL, and only two teams showed interest in him, the 49ers and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't much interest on the Rams' part," he said. "I liked the situation 
with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to make the team, all I had to do was beat out one player." 
</P>
<P>
That player was Kevin Sweeney, former Fresno State and Dallas Cowboys 
quarterback. Last summer in Visalia, Bono and Sweeney played in a charity 
basketball game organized by Denver wide receiver Michael Young. 
</P>
<P>
It was fairly evident then who was the better athlete. While the 6-foot-4 Bono 
was doing behind-the-back slam-dunks, Sweeney was struggling to get the ball up 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
Bono got to play in one game for the 49ers, coming in against the New York Jets 
and completing four of five passes, including one touchdown play of 45 yards to 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sewell, who doubles as a running back and wide receiver for the Broncos, 
attended Riordan High School in San Francisco before going to Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up as a big 49er fan," Sewell said. "They're now my second-favorite 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Commentator John Madden has said that if he were coaching the Broncos, he'd 
forget about trying to establish a running game and just bring in four wide 
receivers on every play. 
</P>
<P>
"Just line 'em up sideline to sideline and have Elway work out of the shotgun 
formation," Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Johnson, shrugging, said: "I guess John Madden can say anything he wants. 
Hey, did I make the All-Madden team?" 
</P>
<P>
He was told he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Nattiel, the Broncos' No. 4 receiver, on Madden's plan: "Sounds good to 
me."

ANGLERS CAN REPAY LARGE DEBT TO NOTT 
</P>

<P>
When Bill Nott and the late Mac McClintock opened Pierpoint Landing in Long 
Beach in 1948, they had no idea of revolutionizing Southern California's public 
sportfishing business. 
</P>
<P>
But their energy and innovation lifted the standards. At their peak, they ran 
32 boats, including the first all-comfort 85-footers. They promoted the sport 
by sponsoring their own local TV show, "Fishing Flashes" -- 275 of them over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Pierpoint was swallowed up by the development of Long Beach Harbor in the 
1960s, but Nott, recognizing the industry's need for a strong lobby, organized 
the Sportfishing Assn. of California (SAC) and served as its president for 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was responsible for achieving regulations allowing fish filleting at sea, 
for making our boats bigger, more comfortable and safer . . . and for creating 
a multi-day fishing permit for Southern California waters," said Bob Fletcher, 
Nott's onetime protege. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's time for sportfishermen to repay Nott. In October, 1988 he had a heart 
attack, followed by double bypass surgery. The operation went well, but his 
diaphragm failed in post-polio syndrome -- he had polio at 17 -- and the 
complication put him on the critical list in St. Mary Medical Center in Long 
Beach for the next six months. The bills ran to $450,000, and when the 
insurance coverage ran out, Nott had to dig into his savings and sell his 
personal 45-foot trawler, the Aquanott. 
</P>
<P>
SAC will have the Bill Nott Benefit Fund Banquet Thursday night, Feb. 1, at the 
Balboa Pavilion on the Balboa Peninsula. Tickets are $75. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is scheduled to attend. Nott and his wife, Winn, have 
known him since the early '50s when she hosted a coffee hour to assist his 
campaign for the state assembly. Later, Nott recommended Fletcher to the 
governor for deputy director of the Department of Fish and Game. When Nott was 
stricken, Fletcher took over SAC. 
</P>
<P>
Nott, 73, is recuperating at his home in Dominguez Hills. He moves around on a 
walker. Because he's still wearing a throat shunt for a night-time respirator, 
he can take only liquid nutrition, but he plans to attend the banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not house-bound," he said. "I'm fine as long as I'm upright. My arms and 
shoulders are getting pretty strong. A little more work on the legs will bring 
them back to where I can get around with just a cane." 
</P>
<P>
Banquet information: (619) 226-6455. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego long-range: The Royal Star out of Fisherman's Landing returned from a 
16-day trip to the Revillagigedo Islands -- Clarion and Socorro -- Sunday with 
its 15 passengers accounting for 300 yellowfin tuna, 50 wahoo, 48 grouper, 28 
sargo and two amberjack. 
</P>
<P>
The largest was a 163.9-pound yellowfin caught by Doug Nightingale, who 
traveled from the salmon-rich waters of his hometown Kenai, Alaska, for a 
change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Matsuhara of Gardena took second- and third-place honors with his 131.9- 
and 130.1-pound yellowfin. Most of the tuna were in the 90- to 130-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Polaris, on an 18-day trip that began last Thursday, was headed south 
and expected at Clarion Island late Tuesday. On a stopover at the Alijos Rocks 
on Saturday the 18 passengers aboard caught 100 yellowfin tuna between 40 and 
90 pounds. On Sunday they managed to land 200 yellowfin from 50 to 125 pounds 
by noon before leaving for the Revillagigedos with room left in its holds for 
more, perhaps bigger, tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Cabo San Lucas: Blue marlin have apparently left the area, but ideal weather 
and bountiful waters are making for an excellent offseason at the southern Baja 
resort city. 
</P>
<P>
Most boats are averaging two or three striped marlin and between 15 and 20 
dorado a day, and fishing for roosterfish has been improving daily, according 
to Darrell Primrose of the Irvine-based Tortuga Sportfishing. Primrose said 
there is no wind, the water is between 70 and 74 degrees and daytime 
temperatures above water are ranging from 76 to 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
San Diego anglers have stopped searching offshore kelp paddies for the small 
yellowtail so plentiful as recently as last month, but one boat found some of 
the larger jacks actively feeding at the nearby Coronado Islands. The Prowler 
took 35 passengers there Saturday and returned with 38 yellowtail between 12 
and 15 pounds. On Sunday, however, strong Santa Ana winds slowed the bite and a 
less-fortunate 35 people managed just two fish. 
</P>
<P>
Add San Diego: The 10th annual Day at the Docks, a celebration of the 
sportfishing community as it heralds the start of the spring season, has been 
scheduled for April 28-29 at the landings at Harbor Drive and Scott Street in 
Point Loma. An all-day fishing tournament, open to the public, kicks off the 
event. Information: (619) 294-7912. 
</P>
<P>
Two men in California's Central Valley paid $2,850 each in fines and lost 
hunting privileges for two years after poaching 26 ducks -- 18 more than their 
combined daily limit -- on privately owned land adjacent to the Sutter National 
Wildlife Refuge. For Allen J. Ledbetter, 39, and Ralph L. Heryford, that worked 
out to $219.23 per duck. . . . Will Steger reported from the Soviet base at 
Vostok that the Trans-Antarctica Expedition's six men and sled dogs would 
follow a marked trail left by a Soviet tractor-truck over the final 850 miles 
to Mirnyy. That decreases concern about falling into hidden crevasses. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County's Lake Cachuma is offering guided eagle tours every 
Wednesday through Sunday. Several eagles are reportedly in the area and the 
flock of Canadian geese has increased to about 5,000, according to the park 
naturalist. Reservations: (805) 568-2460. 
</P>
<P>
Techniques for shore and boat fishing for rainbow and brown trout in the Sierra 
and Southern California reservoirs will be the focus of a seminar by Tom Waters 
and Jim Matthews at Irvine Lake Feb. 3 from 9 a.m.-noon. Cost: $15. 
Information: (714) 261-9779. 
</P>
<P>
Fly fishing: Lani Waller, West Coast field editor for Fly Fisherman magazine, 
will present a program on fly fishing for steelhead trout Thursday at 7:15 p.m. 
at the Long Beach Casting Club's monthly meeting at Recreation Park in Long 
Beach. Information: (213) 426-1826.

LARGEMOUTH BASS BITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Largemouth bass are beginning to stir at many Southland reservoirs, which are 
reporting increased activity by both the bass and bass fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest catches during the past week was a 13-pound 9-ounce 
largemouth taken from Ventura County's Lake Casitas by Harold Choe, who was 
fishing with a guide. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's Lake Castaic produced an 11 3/4-pound bass for Gary 
Harrison of Castaic, and Riverside County's Perris Lake yielded a 9 1/2-pound 
bass to local resident Mark Pettle. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Fishing is slow for all species. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass are active at about 40 feet, biting on spoons, 
frozen anchovies and live shad. Largemouth bass are slow. Catfish are fair on 
anchovies and mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Surface bite for striped bass has slowed. Most are being 
caught by trollers at 35 to 60 feet. Several limits of pan-sized trout have 
been taken from river. Berkley Power Bait is the best bet. Catfish and crappie 
are most active at Topak Marsh. Anything with an odor is working for catfish; 
minnows are the best bet for crappie. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina, averaging about eight pounds, are favoring 
artificials, primarily at Bombay Beach and Red Hill. Channel catfish are biting 
consistently in All-American Canal. Croaker are most active at Salt Creek. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- After two recent trout plants, most limits are coming from 
marina on nightcrawlers and cheese. Trollers are using five colors and 
needlefish lures. Largemouth bass are most active near drop-offs. Mike Glenn, 
Simi Valley, caught a 7 1/2-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass action is picking up, mostly off points, on 
plastic worms and plugs. Harold Choe caught a 13-pound 9-ounce bass. Trout 
fishermen are averaging four fish per stringer. Trollers are using three colors 
and rainbow needlefish. Power Bait is the best bet for bait fishermen. Catfish 
are most active at 30-40 feet, biting on mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass are most active at the dam and near the marina, 
averaging about eight pounds. Phil Brook, of Fillmore, caught a nine-pound 
striper on nightcrawlers. Largemouth bass are slow and are biting best in front 
of bait shop. Catfish are in deep water, biting on mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout are biting at 10-15 feet, best near the dam and at the east 
end. Trollers are using frog needlefish lures. Power Bait and nightcrawlers are 
best bets for bait fishermen. Largemouth bass are biting in the shallows near 
brush. James Wells, of Arleta, caught a 6 1/4-pound bass. Dayton Grant, of 
North Hollywood, caught a 4 1/2-pound bass. Catfish are slow, and are best near 
the dam at 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Trout are biting in both lakes on small spinners and most 
baits. Largemouth bass are active in the lower lake. Spinner baits and 
mudsuckers are working best. Gary Harrison, of Castaic, caught 11 3/4- and 4 
1/2-pound bass. Catfish are slow. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout are picking up, biting primarily in Sierra Cove, along 
buoy line and the west shore. Ben Breese, of Laguna Nigel, caught a 7 1/4-pound 
trout. Jim Haggag, of Norco, caught a 6 1/2-pound trout. Mike Hansen, of 
Orange, had five trout for 21 1/2 pounds. Jim Lockard, of Long Beach, caught a 
10 1/2-pound sturgeon. Tony Yamaoka, of Gardena, caught a 10 1/2-pound 
sturgeon. Largemouth bass and catfish are slow. 
</P>
<P>
PERRIS LAKE -- Largemouth bass action is picking up, primarily near dam. Mark 
Pettle, of Riverside, caught a 9 1/2-pound bass on a plastic worm. Catfish are 
most active at the east end, biting on cut mackerel. Linda Mullins, of Moreno 
Valley, caught 8 1/2-, 15- and 16 1/2-pound catfish. Trout and bluegill are 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
BIG BEAR -- Lake frozen over, no fishing allowed.

PISTONS END BULLS' HOME STREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
Isiah Thomas scored nine consecutive points in the final 8:54 as the Detroit 
Pistons ended the Chicago Bulls' 15-game home winning streak Tuesday night, 
107-95. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 80-79, with 8:54 to play, Detroit outscored the Bulls, 15-6. The Bulls 
pulled to 98-94 with less than three minutes to play, as Michael Jordan scored 
five consecutive points. But the Pistons outscored the Bulls, 12-1, the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very important game for us," Thomas said. "It came at a point of the 
season where things could start snapping. You could lose four or five games in 
a row." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led Detroit with 26 points and Joe Dumars had 16 as the Pistons took 
over first in the Central Division by half a game. Jordan scored 32 points. 
</P>

<P>
It was also the Bullets' seventh consecutive loss on the road and 17th in their 
last 18 road games. 
</P>

NO.1 TIGERS TARGET, BUT RUTGERS MISSES

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart insisted that his team's No. 1 ranking had no 
effect on his players, but it clearly inspired visiting Rutgers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in here with everything to gain and nothing to lose," Rutgers (8-10) 
forward Curtis Hughes said after Missouri held on for an 89-84 victory in its 
first game atop the Associated Press poll. "We had fun all night." 
</P>
<P>
It was not fun for the Tigers (18-1), who didn't seal their 27th consecutive 
home victory until Travis Ford made two free throws with six seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't see any effect," said Stewart, whose team became No. 1 this 
week after beating then-No. 1 Kansas on Saturday. "I hope we can keep some 
order. I think our guys are loose." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri led only 82-79 when the Tigers' John McIntyre made a three-pointer 
with 1:42 to play. McIntyre made 10 of 15 shots, including five of eight 
three-pointers, and scored a career-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he must have been standing out of bounds, that was such a long 
shot," Rutgers Coach Bob Wenzel said. "They should have given him five for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"I told John, 'You're not looking for the shot. You won't shoot unless you 
look,' " Stewart said. "Tonight there was no hesitation. We have good shooters. 
We have to look for it and take it outside. Before, McIntyre was looking 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Syracuse 83, Pittsburgh 74 -- Billy Owens scored 23 points and led a 
second-half run by the Orangemen in a Big East game at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen (13-3 overall, 4-3 in the conference) ended a two-game losing 
streak. Pitt (6-10, 1-5) had won three consecutive visits to the Carrier Dome. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse's Derrick Coleman had 21 points, and his 10 rebounds made him the 
all-time leader in Big East games. His 606 rebounds in conference play put him 
ahead of Patrick Ewing, now of the New York Knicks, who had 597. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 78, No. 24 Alabama 70 -- Freshman Carlus Groves scored seven of his 
nine points in a key stretch midway through the second half for the Volunteers 
in a Southeastern Conference game at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell scored 21 points and Allan Houston added 18 for Tennessee (10-6, 
5-2). Alabama (13-5, 4-3) was led by David Benoit's 22 points. Tennessee made 
seven of its first eight shots and took a 15-2 lead in less than four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson switched his team to a zone defense and slowed 
the Volunteers. Alabama got as close as three points several times in the 
second half but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 81, Boston College 66 -- Michael Cooper scored a career-high 26 
points and freshman Terry Dehere added a career-best 24 points, helping the 
Pirates end a four-game losing streak in a Big East game at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The losing streak was the longest for the Pirates (9-7, 2-4) since the 1986-87 
season. Boston College (6-10, 0-7) suffered its seventh consecutive loss.

HARRICK REMAINS UNHAPPY ABOUT TECHNICAL FOUL CALLED AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seemingly unwilling to drop the matter, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said again 
Tuesday that official Mark Reischling erred last Thursday in calling a 
technical foul on the Bruins' Trevor Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
And the call, Harrick said at his weekly media luncheon, cost UCLA a chance to 
win the game and possibly move into the top 10 in the wire-service polls. It 
also could end up depriving the Bruins of the Pacific 10 Conference 
championship, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Reischling made the call with 2:56 left and UCLA trailing, 71-70, at Stanford. 
Before the Bruins regained possession, Stanford scored six consecutive points 
en route to an 87-79 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody involved feels a little cheated that they didn't allow the 
kids to decide the game," Harrick said of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick protested vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have gotten a technical, quite frankly," Harrick said when asked 
about the game. "I watched the tape and I'm embarrassed about me. (Reischling) 
made a mistake, and now I look like a fool. And it takes away from the great 
play by Stanford and the great crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"They think that's controlling the game. It certainly isn't. They didn't 
control the coaches. They didn't control anybody. That's a tough thing our team 
is going to have to overcome all year long -- one guy making one call." 
</P>
<P>
Reischling, on orders from his supervisors, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA dropped from 16th to 23rd this week in the Associated Press poll and fell 
out of the top 20 in the United Press International poll after being ranked 
15th last week. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick has not been publicly reprimanded by the Pac-10 for his comments about 
the officials, a conference spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank McIntyre, supervisor of basketball officials for the Pac-10, said of 
Harrick: "Because he wants to carry it on, we are not going to carry it on. We 
made the call. It had to be made at the time, and that should be the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
"To keep harping on this continuously doesn't make sense."

L.A. AREA EXPECTED TO BE ON MAJOR DRUG CENTER LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new domestic drug-control strategy to be announced by President Bush Thursday 
will designate Los Angeles County, Houston, Miami, New York and the 
U.S.-Mexican border as high-intensity drug trafficking centers eligible for 
special aid, according to Administration and congressional officials. 
</P>
<P>
The designation of high-intensity regions, including the border area from San 
Diego to Brownsville, Tex., is one element of the Administration's drug-control 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County will not be included in the special centers, officials 
said the entire Southern California area will benefit from the added resources 
assigned to Los Angeles County under the program. 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of the plan, which Bush is expected to announce in a White House 
ceremony, are likely to include a new call for widened death penalty provisions 
for drug dealers and new rules that will allow Customs agents to assume the law 
enforcement powers of Drug Enforcement Administration agents. 
</P>
<P>
But the high-intensity designations are likely to attract the greatest 
attention. Such designations have been under consideration within the 
Administration since drug czar William J. Bennett took office last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, actually picking the areas to be named has been difficult, in part 
because of intense lobbying by local officials from around the country eager to 
obtain the designation and the extra law enforcement funds that they expect to 
come with it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sheriff Brad Gates asked the Bush Administration to include 
Orange County in a high-intensity area because the county has been identified 
by law enforcement as a major transportation hub for drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Gates made the request to Judge Reggie B. Walton, a top aide to Bennett, who 
was touring Southern California to gather information on the drug problem and 
ways to deal with it. Walton made Gates no promises. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and his aides have been trying to play down the significance of the 
designations. "It's not an honorarium or an award," Bennett has told officials 
in meetings around the country. 
</P>
<P>
And Administration officials point out that, at least for this year, the 
designations will carry only limited amounts of additional money -- roughly $25 
million spread among all five areas over the next nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to lower expectations," one official said. "There's not a lot 
there. When you spread it over five areas, $25 million doesn't go too far." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the official noted, various government entities in Los Angeles 
County estimate that the drug problem costs the area roughly $2 billion 
annually, increasing budgets for everything from police to prisons to treatment 
centers and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to the $25 million immediately available, the federal 
drug-control strategy envisions a substantial increase over the next two years 
in the number of federal prosecutors and drug agents assigned to the five 
designated regions. The result will be "a much higher percentage of federal 
resources for these areas," said one source familiar with the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Because the jurisdiction of the federal agencies spills across local 
boundaries, regions surrounding the designated areas are also likely to 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when the government formally designates Los Angeles County as a 
high-intensity drug area, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles will 
receive additional prosecutors. But those prosecutors will be free to work on 
drug cases from throughout the federal Central District of California, which 
includes Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Santa 
Luis Obispo counties, in addition to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Imperial counties will be designated as part of the Southwest 
border high-intensity region. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress directed the Administration to consider six criteria in 
deciding which areas to designate. Included were the amount of local resources 
spent on drug control, the seriousness of each area's drug problem and the 
degree to which each area's drug problem has an impact on other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug strategy includes several elements designed to reduce 
bureaucratic confusion in drug enforcement. One such provision involves the 
powers of Customs agents. Originally, Customs officials had wanted all of their 
roughly 2,600 agents to be given the full powers of a Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent. After DEA objections, Bennett developed a compromise 
under which 1,000 Customs agents will be "cross-designated." DEA will have some 
supervisory authority, but not "heavy-handed DEA controls," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPENDING ON DRUG CONTROL

<P>
Los Angeles County alone annually spends $1.4 billion on drug control efforts. 
Here are the estimated 1989/90 costs:

FOES OF O.C. MEDFLY SPRAY GAIN SUPPORT

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after persuading two Orange County cities to challenge the state's 
Mediterranean fruit fly spraying campaign, malathion critics gained more 
support Tuesday from two state legislators but acknowledged that they still 
face an uphill court fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Elected leaders are finally waking up to the anger of the people over this 
issue," said Jerry Yudelson, a Garden Grove activist who helped draw several 
hundred malathion opponents to a City Council meeting. "But winning in the 
courts isn't going to be easy; the answer may have to be a political one." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to legal challenges over the safety of malathion spraying, critics 
say they may take the state to task for what they call its failure to 
adequately inform the large Vietnamese community in Garden Grove and 
Westminster about the plans to spray in their areas Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
State guidelines require door-to-door notification in English -- or in Spanish 
for Latino communities -- but make no provision for other ethnic communities. 
Officials put out notices to the Vietnamese media and civic leaders in English, 
but some community members said they are still angry. 
</P>
<P>
"This is irresponsible . . . to ignore the Vietnamese community," said Co Long 
Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster. "Not all 
of us understand English. . . . They have not done enough to properly warn us 
of the dangers and the possible consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Other community leaders said the notification problem is particularly 
troublesome because the spraying is scheduled just a day before the start of 
celebrations for this weekend's Tet Festival in the Little Saigon district of 
Garden Grove and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
But Gera Curry of the state Department of Food and Agriculture insisted: "We've 
made an enormous effort to reach out to these people." 
</P>
<P>
Unanimous and unexpected decisions Monday night by city councils in Huntington 
Beach and Garden Grove to seek court orders to halt the state's Medfly assault 
mark the first legal challenge in Southern California to the controversial 
policy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And Tuesday night, the Westminster City Council followed their lead, voting 4 
to 1 to seek a temporary restraining order blocking Thursday's spraying. 
However, such tactics have failed in past court tests in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Those cities and parts of seven others in a 36-square-mile area are to be 
sprayed Thursday night. While attorneys in Huntington Beach scrambled Tuesday 
to line up expert witnesses to go to court before then, lawyers for Garden 
Grove decided that there won't be time for that tactic and will try instead to 
halt next month's sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) joined the Medfly fray on 
Tuesday, becoming the highest elected official in Orange County to oppose the 
spraying. In a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian, he questioned the extent of 
the Medfly infestation and urged the governor to suspend spraying plans. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion critics in Orange County got another encouraging sign Tuesday when 
county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder abstained from voting on a proclamation of 
continued support for the state policy. She had previously voted for the 
measure, thought to be largely symbolic. It passed anyway, 3 to 1, with 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton again voting against it. He had expressed his 
opposition to the spraying in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she thinks the state needs more information on malathion. "A lack 
of knowledge (among residents) certainly does breed fear," she said, adding 
that, with more information, "the hysteria will stop." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) unveiled two bills Tuesday 
that would bring an immediate halt to the use of malathion in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal, which will almost certainly face strong opposition from the 
influential agriculture lobby, represented the first major political attack to 
date against the state's policy. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials, undeterred by a recent groundswell of opposition among 
both residents and politicians, said they are going ahead as planned with the 
first-ever spraying Thursday in an area of Orange County that includes parts of 
Cypress, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Stanton, Orange, Anaheim, Westminster, 
Garden Grove and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"The legal statutory authority for the spraying decision lies with the director 
(of Food and Agriculture) and no one else," said Curry, the state agriculture 
official. "I don't really see that there's an issue here." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Getz, a deputy attorney general who will defend the state against any 
lawsuits, noted that efforts to challenge the state's spraying authority failed 
several times in Santa Clara County in 1980-81 and face a similar fate now. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions by the Huntington Beach and Garden Grove councils to go to court 
were unexpected, surpassing even the hopes of the malathion opponents. Just 
last week, council members in Garden Grove refused to oppose the malathion 
spraying, saying that the city had no power over the issue. But they reversed 
themselves after hearing impassioned pleas from speaker after speaker at the 
jammed council meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that the amount of malathion used in the spraying is not 
harmful," Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan told residents. But he voted to seek court 
relief anyway. "I just changed my mind. It was a compromise really," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Donovan wrote to mayors of the 11 other North County cities in the 
spray zone, asking them to join Garden Grove in taking "whatever legal means 
necessary to prevent the Medfly spraying." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to ask the city attorney to look 
into what legal grounds the city might have to halt the spraying and report 
back on Feb. 6. Councilman Irv Pickler, who cast the no vote, said he wanted to 
take action immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Groups and municipalities in the Los Angeles area, hit earlier and more often 
than Orange County by malathion spraying, have talked about a lawsuit but have 
not reached any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
That Orange County cities took the lead on the issue surprised Los Angeles 
environmental activist David Bunn of Pesticide Watch, who has been involved in 
the protests. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of environmental and health issues, a lot of people think of Orange 
County as not exactly a hotbed of activism," Bunn said. "This proves that 
false."

<P>
THURSDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
No repeat spray application has been planned at this time. Officials will 
continue to monitor the 1,500 traps distributed over an 81-square-mile area 
that includes that spray zone plus surrounding area. If additional flies are 
found, a second spraying would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly hot line in the Orange County Agricultural Commission office will be 
open from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. for residents with questions. The number is (714) 
447-7118. The hot line will be shut down after Friday. Inquiries after that can 
be made to the agricultural commissioner's office at (714) 447-7100. 
</P>
<P>
The droplets that were sprayed in North County are from a mixture that is about 
three-quarters protein-corn syrup bait, to lure the fruit flies, and 
one-quarter malathion, the pesticide being used to kill them. About 12 ounces 
per square mile were scheduled to be applied over the target area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered new tests of 
malathion, to try to resolve questions about its effect on human health, state 
officials assert that it is "one of the safest insecticides in use today." 
State officials say that the low doses used in aerial spraying pose no health 
threat to anyone, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly and 
the chronically ill. 
</P>
<P>
They also say that no one should have any reservations about going outside 
after the spraying is completed. Animals with the exception of fish, which are 
considered very susceptible should not be affected either, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials assert that if possible, they would prefer to avoid the 
public concern and inconvenience that malathion use can cause by infiltrating 
infested areas with millions of sterile Medflies and thus preventing the 
spread. However, they say a shortage of sterile Medflies has eliminated that 
option, forcing sometimes repeated sprayings around the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, all patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household items 
left outdoors during the spraying should be hosed down. If a car has been 
sprayed, it should be washed with soap and water. 
</P>

In spite of mid-January storms, there is only a 10% chance of a normal runoff 
of water into the Northern California dams that defend much of the state from 
drought, the Department of Water Resources said in its latest forecast of 
runoff that could be expected in the Sacramento River watershed. Most of 
California's reserve water supply is stored in three large dams on the 
Sacramento and its tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
They are Shasta Dam on the Sacramento near Redding, Oroville Dam on the Feather 
River and Folsom Dam on the American River near Sacramento. The long-term 
average on runoff of water into the Sacramento River basin has been 18.9 
million acre-feet a year. The chances of normal rainfall have not looked good 
since Jan. 17, when the last storm died out, officials said.

MEASLES EPIDEMIC CLAIMS 1ST LOCAL DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC HEALTH: A SANTA ANA INFANT HAS BECOME THE FIRST COUNTY RESIDENT TO DIE 
IN THE MEASLES OUTBREAK, EVEN WHILE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE SEEMS TO BE 
SUBSIDING.

<P>
Although Orange County's measles epidemic seems to be waning, a 7-month-old 
Santa Ana boy has become the first county resident to die from the current 
outbreak, a top county health official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Another six residents also have contracted the viral infection so far this 
year, five of them from a church group whose tenets forbid immunization, county 
epidemiologist Thomas J. Prendergast said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, although the pace of infection has lessened markedly -- only four cases 
in December, contrasted with at least 20 or 30 a month earlier last year -- the 
county's 21-month-long epidemic is far from over, Prendergast warned Tuesday. 
"We're still seeing transmission" of measles here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A key state health official agreed, adding that the disease, is not on the wane 
elsewhere. "Our worst measles epidemic in a decade" is continuing with major 
outbreaks in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Fresno counties, said 
Dr. Loring Dales, chief of the immunization unit for the state Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
California saw the disease grow to epidemic proportions in October, 1987. The 
outbreak struck Orange County in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation, there are still major outbreaks in Texas, Illinois and 
Pennsylvania, Dales added. 
</P>
<P>
The first measles-related death of an Orange County resident occurred last 
Wednesday night at UCI Medical Center in Orange when little Jose Herrera died 
of encephalitis and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
UCI doctors said the infant's fatal complications were directly attributable to 
his severe case of measles. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's parents "took him into the hospital appropriately. But his lung 
disease kept getting worse," said Dr. Alan Davis, the medical center's director 
of pediatric intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was too young to have been immunized against measles, doctors noted. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Peter Graves, a UCI fellow in pediatrics who also treated Jose: "I've 
seen older kids come in with measles, but the real young ones come in and 
they're just devastated. There's a real difference between 6 months and 6 
years" in a child's ability to fight off an infection such as measles. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Herrera Sr., 26, who works at a San Juan Capistrano nursery, said he and 
his wife, Riena Ramirez Herrera, 20, buried their only child Tuesday. Friends 
chipped in for funeral expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father said his wife had noticed in late December that the baby was 
very ill. "She said, 'Come. Come over here and see the baby!' He was very sick 
and I took him (to the hospital) right away," he said. Initially admitted to 
Coastal Community Hospital, the child eventually was transferred to UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Herrera Sr. said he already has been warning other parents about the 
danger of measles. "I was telling people that when your baby has a high fever 
and red spots, take him right away to the doctors or the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
County epidemiologist Prendergast said that after nearly two years of watching 
measles cases mount, he was not surprised by the death of an Orange County 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic thing when it happens," he said. "But it's unavoidable if you 
have 400, 500 cases." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County recorded 388 measles cases in 1989 alone, the highest total since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, another measles death occurred in Orange County when an 11-month-old 
boy died last July from complications of measles after he was transferred to 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County from Pomona Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Because his family was from Pomona, his death was recorded with Los Angeles 
County measles statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking briefly about her baby's death last year, Bobbie Owens said Tuesday 
that 11-month-old Nathan Timothy was just beginning to walk when he developed a 
high fever and, several days later, a rash. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan developed severe encephalitis as well as pneumonia. Despite "very 
aggressive treatment," he died from respiratory failure, CHOC infection-control 
coordinator Abby Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan had been scheduled to get his measles shot but caught the disease a week 
before the appointment. Owens said her son's case "was just bad timing. He just 
happened to catch it (measles) before he got the shot." 
</P>
<P>
"If I could, I'd like to help somebody else's child. . . ," Owens said. "People 
should go and have their kids immunized." 
</P>
<P>
Acting on recommendations from county health officials and the American Academy 
of Pediatrics, Orange County doctors for the last year have been immunizing 
children earlier -- at 12 months instead of the previously recommended 15 
months. Also, because of the national measles epidemic, the Academy of 
Pediatrics and federal health officials have recommended that young people 
receive a second measles shot -- either as they enter junior high school or 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Measles, also known as red measles or rubeola, is a highly infectious disease. 
Although it can be mild -- starting with fever, cough, watery eyes and causing 
a rash about four days after the first symptoms -- its complications include 
ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia and, rarely, encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 2,900 Californians were hospitalized with measles and at least 17 
people died, most of them preschool-age children, state immunization chief 
Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the disease is being transmitted in several ways, Prendergast 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six Orange County residents who became ill with measles this month 
are members of a church group which holds that immunizations violate their 
beliefs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A minister for the group told county health officials Tuesday that he did not 
want to be interviewed and asked county officials not to reveal his 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Another path for transmission, Prendergast said, has been through young 
Latinos, many of whom are recent arrivals to the United States from Mexico, 
where measles are also prevalent.

NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL NEAR SCHOOL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE BOZANICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding the pleas of students and parents concerned about safety, the City 
Council on Monday narrowly approved the installation of a traffic signal in 
front of Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people jammed council chambers, the vast majority of whom were 
students, parents and staff members of the school who favored putting in the 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the project by a 3-2 vote, with Mayor Robert P. Wahlstrom 
and Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi holding the dissenting opinion that the 
signal would not solve the safety problems in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The signal will be installed on Cerritos Avenue between Los Alamitos Boulevard 
and Del Norte Way during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Students and parents related stories of numerous "fender benders" and near 
misses as cars line up on eastbound Cerritos Avenue each morning to turn left 
into the school. 
</P>
<P>
They told of the fear they felt looking for a safe opening to make the left 
turn and darting across the fast-moving traffic on westbound Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was safety a concern, they said, but also traffic congestion. Jay 
Coffman, a senior at the high school, said it takes students an average of 10 
minutes to get into the school parking lot in the morning and 20 minutes to get 
out of it in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Wahlstrom said there were other alternatives -- including rerouting traffic 
around the block and prohibiting left turns into the campus -- that should be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
"People should not be rewarded for violating the traffic laws of our city," 
Wahlstrom said, referring to jaywalkers. "I don't like the false sense of 
security a signal gives people. . . . I think we would get a very poor return 
on our investment." 
</P>
<P>
With the council's approval of the plan, $12,000 will be allocated from the 
city's 1989-90 fiscal year budget for the design of the signal. An additional 
$80,000 to complete the project would come out of next year's budget. KATHIE

RESIDENTS SAY IT'S TIME TO RAISE BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of West Newport Beach residents on Tuesday urged that the Newport 
Boulevard bridge leading to the peninsula be raised as well as widened. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing on the widening proposal, being considered by the Coast 
Guard, some residents said they believed that if changes are going to be made, 
the bridge should also be raised to allow their boats to pass under it without 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Willford, an attorney representing the Citizens' West Channel Bridge 
Committee, said, "The bridge already needs raising, and now is the best time 
since we are making such a major modification to it." 
</P>
<P>
Harold G. Polley, who has lived along the West Newport channel for 31 years, 
also stressed the need to raise the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"A 50-year-old bridge is not adequate for 1990," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The application presented to the Coast Guard by Caltrans and the city of 
Newport Beach would widen the bridge, first built in 1936, by 29 feet. A third 
northbound traffic lane and wider bicycle-pedestrian access would be added. 
</P>
<P>
The widening would not affect the clearance for boats passing under the bridge, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
John Walter, principal civil engineer for the city, said that increasing the 
height by 4 or 5 feet would add up to $5 million to the project. He said that 
"the funds are tight and the clearance is OK." 
</P>
<P>
If the Coast Guard doesn't approve the application as is, an amended 
application will have to be resubmitted and the funds now allocated for the 
widening will be gone, according to Paul Gonzales of Caltrans. He cautioned 
that it could take 10 years for the reapplication to be approved and the funds 
to again become available. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer said: "In order to raise the bridge, we need to rebuild 
it. The council voted not to go ahead with a new bridge two or three years ago 
because of the cost." 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 vehicles a day travel over the Newport Boulevard bridge and 
400 youngsters ride their bikes or walk over it on their way to and from 
school. During the summer months, those numbers greatly increase. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of public hearings on the plan are completed, the Coast Guard 
will evaluate its findings and make a recommendation to Coast Guard officials 
in Washington, who will either approve or deny the city's application. If 
approved, work is scheduled to begin in September and take about eight months 
to complete.MARCI HANOVER

5 NAMED TO GROUP FOR OPEN SPACE BOND

<TEXT>
<P>
A former mayor and four city commissioners have been named to a residents' 
committee lobbying to preserve open space through a general obligation bond 
scheduled for the April ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Byrnes, who served as mayor from 1973-75, will head fund raising for San 
Juan Citizens for Open Space. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Byrnes on a steering committee for the group are Planning Commissioners 
Gil Jones and Wyatt Hart, and Parks and Recreation Commissioners Terry Dorse 
and Pauline Leonard. Also serving on the committee are community activists Al 
Aarps, Wilson Buckner, Mike Darnold, local Little League president Vickee 
Donoho, Stan Holditch and Gail Prothero. Capistrano Unified School District 
Trustee Marlene Draper is chairwoman of the grass-roots organization. 
</P>
<P>
The $21-million general obligation bond would be used to buy 120 acres of 
farmland in the north end of the city. Officials envision the land as a public 
recreation area that would include orange groves, a community center, bicycle 
trails and playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which will cost the city $23,000, is scheduled for the April 10 
ballot. The measure needs a two-thirds vote to pass. WENDY PAULSON

REGIONAL PARK PLAN NEEDS PUBLIC'S INPUT

<P>
A special meeting to select an advisory committee and begin planning for a new 
114-acre regional park in Upper Newport Bay will be held tonight at the Newport 
Dunes Clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the land for the proposed Upper Newport Bay Regional Park was acquired 
last summer by the county from the Irvine Co. in exchange for approval of 
nearby residential and commercial developments in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The county park will not include any wetlands, which are managed by the state 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
County officials plan to build a nature interpretive center at the park as well 
as expand the existing system of hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to maintain and enhance existing areas and add passive 
recreational uses," said Denton Turner, design manager for the county's 
regional parks. "What the committee will help us determine is what recreational 
uses are appropriate, where they are appropriate and at what level or intensity 
of use." 
</P>
<P>
County planners are seeking applicants to serve on a special advisory panel 
that will help shape development of the proposed park. Those interested can 
apply at tonight's 7 p.m. meeting at the Newport Dunes Clubhouse, 1131 Back Bay 
Drive in Newport Beach. STEVE CHURM

Though tempted by the high waves and sunny skies, sunbathers and surfers stayed 
out of the ocean and on their towels Tuesday as contaminated waters washed 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
Dotting the water's edge were red-and-white signs: "Warning. Keep Out. 
Contaminated Water. By Order of the Health Officer, County of Orange." 
</P>
<P>
A four-mile stretch of beach between Newport Pier and Huntington Beach at Beach 
Boulevard remained closed after a sewage spill last week at a regional 
treatment plant in Fountain Valley prompted health authorities to quarantine 
the waters. The sewage spilled into storm drains leading to the Santa Ana 
River, and flowed into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see most of the area opened by Wednesday afternoon," said Mike 
Wehner, chief of the Orange County environmental health water quality program. 
"It depends on the sample results. We are now waiting for results from tests 
taken Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers who come in contact with the bacteria-laden waters risk catching 
hepatitis or contacting a skin rash, depending on their length of exposure and 
the bacterial concentration, Wehner said. A more typical illness, 
gastroenteritis, which includes symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and nausea, can 
result if a person swallows the water, he added. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two toddlers ran bare-footed through the waters at Huntington 
Beach. Their parents, who asked not to be named, said, "We figure as long as 
they don't drink the water we can always wash off their feet." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the contaminated water, sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s 
brought people to the beaches. Similar weather is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
"The signs scare me away from the water, but not from the beach," said Teri 
Benner of Costa Mesa, as she took pictures of two friends posing on the rocks 
at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She was concerned that there were not enough signs warning of the 
contamination. "People might not have seen them and entered the water." The 
signs are posted about every 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A couple, Kathy and Bill Kellog, strolled along the beach picking up sea shells 
Tuesday morning. Kathy Kellog said, "I worry about the fish and other sea 
creatures more than humans going out there and swimming. The poor things have 
to live in this filth. 
</P>
<P>
"Humans fouled the water, not the fishes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others were disappointed that the sewage spill cost them a good day of surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy surf pumping in from the northwest reached 6 feet at many beaches, the 
National Weather Service said. STEPHEN C. CHAVEZ

<P>
Two Republican candidates in the 31st state Senate District race traded barbs 
and allegations of misconduct Tuesday, accusing each other of mudslinging in a 
hotly contested race entering its home stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) kicked off the day's volleys with a 
morning press conference during which he accused Brea City Councilman Ron 
Isles, another Republican vying for the seat, of slandering him in a recent 
mailing. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has asked the local Republican Party to censure Isles, but the 
councilman retorted by defending the mailing and saying that Ferguson had "shot 
himself in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The mailing, which describes Ferguson and another candidate, Assemblyman Frank 
Hill (R-Whittier), as the "two best legislators that money can buy," states 
that Ferguson is under investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission 
for mistakes he made in reporting 1987 campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson vigorously denied that he is under investigation, but FPPC spokeswoman 
Sandra Michioku said Tuesday that the commission continues to have an 
unresolved case against the assemblyman. She would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
When told that the FPPC had confirmed the investigation, Ferguson's aides 
produced a Dec. 4 letter indicating that the FPPC proposed fining Ferguson 
$2,000 for allegedly failing to report in 1987 four contributions totaling 
$10,000, including $1,500 in non-monetary contributions. The aides said 
Ferguson intends to contest the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ferguson has asked the Republican Party of Orange County to censure 
Isles for the mailing and for violating a written pledge in which Republican 
candidates agreed to refrain from personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to abide by that pledge, I expect (my opponents) to abide by that 
pledge," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee of the county Republican Party has scheduled a meeting 
tonight to review Ferguson's request for censure. The committee can recommend 
censure or other disciplinary action if Isles is found to have violated the 
pledge, said Greg Haskin, the party's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Isles quickly launched a broadside of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I never cease to be amazed at the mental processes that go on in some people," 
Isles said. He supplied voluminous documents -- newspaper and magazine articles 
-- to support most of the claims he makes in his mailing and said the 
allegation that Ferguson is under investigation by the FPPC came from FPPC 
officials themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Isles drew a distinction between a "hit piece" and one "pointing out a person's 
record." 
</P>
<P>
"After all, we're not selling soap here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates are vying for the state Senate seat in the 31st District, 
which includes parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties and was vacated in 
December when Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) resigned. The special 
election has been set for Feb. 6, but most experts predict that none of the 
candidates will win an outright majority, so a runoff election is expected on 
April 10.

A man armed with what witnesses said appeared to be a Molotov cocktail robbed a 
savings and loan Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred about 11 a.m. when a man entered World Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. at 22379 El Toro Road, said that he had a bomb and demanded money, FBI 
spokesman Jim Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
A teller, who said the object he was carrying looked like a Molotov cocktail, 
or firebomb, handed the robber some money. The man put an undisclosed amount of 
cash in a zipper bag and fled, Neilson said.

<P>
The robber was described as being Latino, about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and 
weighing 160 pounds, with dark hair. He was wearing a dark sweat shirt, jeans

DAUGHTER OF ROBERT BADHAM TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR GIL FERGUSON'S ASSEMBLY SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: PHYLLIS BADHAM HOPES HER FAMILY NAME MAKES HER THE GOP FRONT-RUNNER 
IN THE 70TH DISTRICT. IT HINGES ON THE INCUMBENT'S QUEST FOR A SENATE SEAT.

<P>
Phyllis Badham -- born into a political family and reared in Orange County -- 
said Tuesday that she is on the verge of making her first run for elected 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, daughter of former U.S. Rep. Robert Badham, said she has "been meeting 
with a lot of people, and getting a lot of encouragement" to run for the 
Republican nomination in the 70th Assembly District. That post is held by 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), but he is vying for the state 
Senate seat in District 31. 
</P>
<P>
If Ferguson wins that race, his vacant seat would likely be contested by 
several local Republicans. But if he loses, most if not all are expected to 
back out. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Badham refused to speculate on how Ferguson's fate in his race would 
affect her decision on whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all waiting to see what happens," she said, "but I'm putting my campaign 
together today." 
</P>
<P>
For Badham, 30, the race would mark her first attempt at elected office, but 
she said her family background, as well as her experience in public relations 
and lobbying, would make her the early front-runner. Badham added that she is 
still completing position papers, but said she was "pro-choice" on the issue of 
abortion and advocates ocean and beach cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been called the wild card, and I love that," she said. "I know how to get 
things done in Sacramento, and I am the only professional woman running. I 
think those things will help me." 
</P>
<P>
Her likely opponents are less convinced that Badham's credentials would propel 
her into the spotlight. Chuck Devore, for instance, believes that Badham would 
help "liven up the race" but added that he does not consider her an automatic 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken as a whole, I'm more than willing to match up my credentials against any 
other candidate," said Devore, a former aide to Rep. C. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) who has already set up a campaign office and raised several 
thousand dollars in his quest for the Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Badham is public affairs director for Ricoh Electronics in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, she has worked with Rockwell International, the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers and a Los Angeles consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
She attended Newport Harbor High School and received her bachelor's degree in 
political science and communications from Cal State Chico.

COLLEGE OFFERS FREE CLASS ON SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
A free class on sexual abuse of children and adolescents is being offered to 
county residents at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The instructor, Valerie Bradford, is a professional counselor with a graduate 
degree in social work from USC. 
</P>
<P>
She has a private practice in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Most class members have either been victims of sexual abuse themselves or have 
been affected by the impact of abuse on others. 
</P>
<P>
Of all substance abusers, 80% have been victims of sexual abuse, Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
She told the class that she too was a victim of abuse at the hands of a member 
of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Although a 1985 Los Angeles Times survey of more than 2,500 U.S. adults 
indicated that 27% of women and 10% of men were sexually abused as children, 
Bradford believes that the true number is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
"When you include non-touching abuse (exhibitionism, pornography, etc.) the 
total is closer to 50%," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual abuse occurs "when a person has been exploited by someone more powerful 
than he or she for the perpetrator's sexual stimulation," Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the exploitation can be "either by an overt or covert sexual 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
The course is held Saturday mornings in Room AE7 at Cypress College, 9200 
Valley View St. in Cypress and will continue to meet through mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Topics to be covered in future meetings include: theories regarding the causes 
of sexual abuse, the impacts on victims, the law regarding disclosure and 
treatment.

DANA HILLS DONE IN BY LATE GOAL

The Mission Viejo High School girls' soccer team found a way to solve Dana 
Hills' stingy defense in a South Coast League game Tuesday at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hampton scored on a late breakaway to give the Diablos a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, the fifth-ranked team in 4-A, is 13-3-2 overall, 3-2-1 in 
league. Dana Hills, in second place in the South Coast League behind El Toro, 
is 15-3-1, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills, the ninth-ranked team in 4-A, had only allowed 10 goals in 18 games 
this season. Goalie Bri O'Dowd had recorded 12 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 76th minute, the Diablos broke through. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo sweeper Jennifer Ward lofted a pass from midfield over the 
defense to Hampton, who broke free down the middle and beat O'Dowd from short 
range. It was Hampton's second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up and saw I was one-on-one with the keeper," Hampton said. "I just 
wanted to see how close I could get and still get it in the back of the net. I 
couldn't have faced my teammates if I'd missed." DENNIS KAISER

INSTRUCTION CAMPS DON'T ALWAYS HELP YOUNG WRESTLERS 
</P>

<P>
Esperanza wrestling Coach Chuck Bishop has mixed emotions when his wrestlers 
leave for instructional camps every summer. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, Bishop hands out packets of information and applications about 
summer camps to his team. 
</P>
<P>
But Bishop said his wrestlers are making a risky investment when they pay fees 
ranging from $20-$30 for a one-day camp to $365 for larger camps, such as the 
one run by former Olympian Dan Gable at the University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"Camp costs are increasing to the point where there are diminishing returns for 
a freshman or a sophomore who goes to one of the high-pressure camps," Bishop 
said. "They're learning skills there that they're not able to use because they 
don't have the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said wrestlers with five or six years of experience have mastered the 
basic moves and can benefit from the coaching at the larger camps. He said many 
younger, inexperienced wrestlers go to the larger camps in hopes of being 
competitive the following year. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, those are false hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches overemphasize the importance of the camps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They think because everyone else is doing it, then they do too," Bishop said. 
"I've had some kids go off to instructional camps and come back with no 
improvements." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, California is a hotbed for summer camps. Bishop said several of 
the top wrestling schools -- Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Iowa State -- have 
summer camps in California as well as in their home states. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are coming out here in the summer because of the resources and 
wrestlers we have here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's Rob Langenwalter, who has a 27-2 record and is ranked No. 1 in 
Orange County at 126 pounds, said he learned several new moves at Cal State 
Fullerton's camp in 1988. Bishop said nine members of Esperanza's team attended 
camps last summer, but Langenwalter stayed home to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good chance for you to get down your technique," Langenwalter said of 
the camps. "You get to see a variety of new moves and try them out. 
</P>
<P>
"During the wrestling season, you spend all of your time training and you don't 
have any time to work on new moves. The summer gives you time to reflect on 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
A typical camp day begins with a two-mile run at 7 a.m., Langenwalter said. 
Wrestlers spend four hours studying moves and then practicing them. After a 
two-hour break, they're back for two more hours of wrestling, and later, an 
hour-long lecture. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there's even a third session (of wrestling)," Langenwalter said. 
"Then you go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said the rest is well-earned. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these camps give kids up to seven, eight or even nine hours of 
instruction each day," Bishop said. "They spend as many as 45 hours a week 
working out." 
</P>
<P>
Many wrestlers don't retain what they've learned at the camps, Bishop said. 
Some either don't take notes on what they've learned or keep poor notes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked one of my wrestlers for notes after he got back and they were so bad 
you couldn't even read them," Bishop said. "Some of the better camps supply 
them with handouts." 
</P>
<P>
Langenwalter said he kept notes from both camps he attended. He said he reviews 
the notes frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can gain a lot from the camps," he said. "It's a positive 
experience. There's not a great deal of risk as far as injury because 
everything is done in a controlled environment. The staffs are top-notch." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said coaches have started using videotapes to help wrestlers study 
moves. Matches are taped and played back so wrestlers can review their 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Gable, the coach at Iowa, which is a perennial wrestling power, and several 
other top coaches and wrestlers have marketed videotapes teaching moves. 
Wrestlers also can buy tapes of state championship matches, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the videos have been introduced, we've seen a new dimension in the 
marketing of wrestling," Bishop said. "Instead of spending $60 for a camp, they 
can buy a tape for about $15 and watch it a thousand times if they want." 
</P>
<P>
Langenwalter has a wrestling tape made by Carl Adams, the coach at Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have so I can go back and review moves," Langenwalter said. "It's 
pretty basic, but it's a good thing to have if I decide to coach myself." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY... 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of wrestling terminology: 
</P>
<P>
Ball and chain: A combination move that pushes an opponent's head onto the mat, 
bringing down his shoulder blades, forcing the pin. 
</P>
<P>
Banana splits: A painful, but effective move using the legs to hold an opponent 
and set him up for a pin. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-lipped: When wrestler becomes so exhausted and oxygen deficient, his lips 
turn blue. Also known as gassed. 
</P>
<P>
E-ride: Being thrown to the mat from standing position. (One knee must hit 
first or the move is defined as a slam, which is illegal.) Also known as a 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
Fish: also known as a squid, it refers to an incompetent wrestler, one who just 
flops around. (El Dorado's tournament was once referred to as the Lake 
tournament. "Because there were so many fish there," former Loara Coach John 
Dahlem said.) 
</P>
<P>
Guillotine: A firm hold on an opponent's upper body. 
</P>
<P>
Leg ride: Using a leg to bring down an opponent; can work into banana splits. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson: Holding one hand around an opponent's neck for control. A full nelson 
involves two hands and is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Shark: A very tough, proficient wrestler, also known as a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
Stick: Same as a pin. To be pinned, wrestler must have both shoulder blades on 
the mat. 
</P>
<P>
Sucking weight: Losing weight to meet a particular weight class, as in He 
really had to suck weight this week. Also, cutting weight.

All week, you've sucked weight. 
</P>
<P>
You've practiced your guillotines, leg rides and banana splits. 
</P>
<P>
You're confident you'll be able to stick your man with a quick body lock, 
launch him with an E-ride and pin him with a ball-and-chain carry-over. 
</P>
<P>
You're no fish. You're no squid.

<P>
You're a shark, a stallion . . . The best wrestler around. 
</P>
<P>
The language of wrestling is like no other in any high school sport. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's because when your face is being squashed into a sweaty mat, your 
body is being treated like a pretzel and your girlfriend is watching as you get 
pinned, there needs to be more than one way to say, "Ugh." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, which has some of the best high school wrestlers in the 
state, athletes who choose wrestling as their primary sport rarely do so 
without an understanding of the dedication -- or obsession, many would say -- 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I wrestled, I would think, 'What's so hard about that?' " said Ryan 
Holmes, a freshman at El Modena. "But oh man, I played football -- there's no 
comparison. People think Hell Week in football is bad, but wrestling practice 
is way harder. People have no idea how tough it is." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it be in their conditioning drills, dietary concerns or psychological 
war games, wrestlers, indeed, have it tough. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a look at the trials -- physically and emotionally -- a 
wrestler must go through to prepare for a match. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAME OF THE GAME: PAIN 
</P>
<P>
Imagine grabbing a door knob, squeezing it as hard as you can and holding that 
grip for six minutes. Your hand, wrist and forearm quickly begin to burn from 
the buildup of lactic acid, until even your shoulder and neck begin to ache. 
</P>
<P>
Now imagine this feeling taking over your entire body. 
</P>
<P>
That, former Loara Coach John Dahlem says, is only part of what wrestlers must 
deal with during the six minutes of their match. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe wrestling is the most demanding of all sports," said Dahlem, 
who led Loara to 10 consecutive league championships and two Southern Section 
titles in his 15 years as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to demean other sports, but wrestling is the only high school sport 
that you're in physical contact with one other person, going full bore all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
That is why, coaches say, wrestling practices must be so demanding. There is no 
better way to prepare an athlete for a match other than to simulate the highly 
competitive conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Although most practices begin with slow, easy warm-up drills, stretching and 
jogging -- all crucial for injury prevention -- the hardest part of the workout 
usually begins with several types of drills. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyon, there are stomach crunches, back and neck exercises and an endless 
variety of sit-ups, all done to strengthen different parts of the body. At El 
Modena, there are line drills -- Army crawls, snake drills and Russian hops to 
name a few -- in which the athletes perform different wrestling moves in a 
continuous motion to build endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Then the athletes break into groups for round-robin style mini-matches. 
</P>
<P>
At El Modena, they call it the Ironman drill. Four of the athletes take turns 
wrestling each other for one-minute periods. When the whistle blows, the 
wrestlers change partners and start again. This routine continues for nearly a 
half-hour. Along with the encouraging yells from coaches, the room is filled 
with the grunts and groans usually heard during a fight scene in a bad western. 
</P>
<P>
When it's over, most of the athletes look as if they're ready to hit the 
showers. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. They're only half way there. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything so fully consuming than using every body part, every 
muscle to full exhaustion," El Dorado Coach Frank Gonzales said. "But that's 
what these kids do every single day." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, more than once a day. During off-season camps, for instance, 
athletes are pushed harder than ever, as El Modena's 105-pounder Danny Wells 
describes: 
</P>
<P>
"We had about 20% of the kids quit during the two weeks I was there. It was 
really, really, really tough. They wake you up real early and you go on a long 
run. Then you buddy-carry (running with a guy over your shoulder) two miles 
into the back country and two miles out. Then you go on a Rambo run, going as 
far as you can with a guy on your back. 
</P>
<P>
"You come back and do technique work. Then you eat lunch. After that, you start 
the hard practice. That's the part most people can't handle. You just want to 
die. After that, you eat dinner, then you have a night session . . . Then you 
either run or lift weights before you go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
That camp lasted two weeks, said Wells, the Century League champion at 98 
pounds as a sophomore last year. 
</P>
<P>
"You see seniors there just break down in the corner crying," Wells said. 
"That's how freaked out people get. You never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MENTAL MOVES 
</P>
<P>
While a good deal of wrestling success comes from the physical training, an 
athlete's psychological state, namely his confidence, also is important. 
</P>
<P>
At the Five Counties Invitational last Saturday, wrestlers from all over the 
state gathered for one of California's most highly contested tournaments. While 
some of the matches were going on, those waiting their turn stood along the gym 
wall, away from the fans and the action, rolling their necks, listening to 
personal stereos, trying to psyche-up. 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, one would clench his fist to his side and shout an 
encouragement to himself. Others would sit with their eyes closed, visualizing 
themselves winning their match. These pre-match moments, coaches say, are often 
crucial to a wrestler's success. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous fear factor involved with wrestling" that few people 
realize," said Dahlem. "It's a combat sport, really. So you really have to 
overcome a lack of courage, which is normal for most people. I had kids who 
were seniors come to me and say, 'Coach, I'm afraid.' Not everybody's so 
mentally tough. So there's a lot of mental preparation, a lot of psyching" that 
needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Most wrestlers say there is nothing worse than losing -- "I'd rather go through 
a 300-hour workout than lose," Wells said -- mostly because, unlike team 
sports, attention falls on only one person. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one-on-one out there and if you lose, there's no place to hide," El 
Modena Coach Alan Clinton said. "(To keep going after losing) takes a lot of 
guts. Big egos can't survive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PASS THE CELERY STICKS 
</P>
<P>
While crash dieting has always been an inherent part of wrestling -- athletes, 
vying for one of 13 weight classes, often try to lose pounds to make a lower 
(and less competitive) weight class -- most coaches say they are, as a whole, 
better educated about nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyon, Coach Gary Bowden said losing weight is not encouraged and most of 
his athletes actually "wrestle up," into a higher class. Of course, other 
coaches might point out that Canyon, the county's top-ranked program with 
nearly 100 wrestlers, can afford to do so because it has more athletes from 
which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many quick weight-loss methods -- such as bingeing and purging, using 
diuretics and laxatives and exercising in rubber suits -- all have proven 
ill-effects and are still being used by wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Five Counties meet, one wrestler said he had thrown up twice that 
morning, a practice he admitted using frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sad part of wrestling," Dahlem said. "I think it's a bad wrap that 
(bulimia and anorexia) are prevalent, but . . . yes, it is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note, there's the weighing in of wrestlers the morning before 
their match. 
</P>
<P>
Some wrestlers stand on one side of the scale, hoping to affect the weight. 
Some will cut their hair before they get on the scale. Others shave. "Even the 
14-year-olds with peach fuzz," Dahlem said. 
</P>
<P>
"The funniest thing is the kids who will stand on their heads in the corner of 
the room before they weigh in," Dahlem said. "They'll stand on their heads and 
think that will make a difference. I even had one kid who weighed in standing 
on his hands." 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the hard work and pain, most wrestlers say one thing keeps them 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning," Wells said. "A win is . . . the ultimate. And when you stick a guy 
(pin an opponent), it's all yours." 
</P>

NEWPORT BEACH BROKERAGE ACQUIRES SANTA BARBARA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach brokerage firm that has been making moves 
into investment banking, has doubled its work force and increased business 
about 33% by acquiring a Santa Barbara brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Cruttenden has purchased Talley, McNeil &amp; Co., a Santa Barbara brokerage, 
for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Both firms are privately held. Cruttenden has 25 employees engaged in 
brokerage, investment banking, venture capital and research, and Talley, McNeil 
has 20 employees acting mainly as brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Cruttenden III, chairman of Cruttenden &amp; Co., described Talley, 
McNeil as "a tremendous retail office in a highly affluent market." 
</P>
<P>
Talley, McNeil, founded four years ago by Richard Talley and Sid McNeil, will 
continue to do business under its current name. Talley has joined Cruttenden's 
board and executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara firm has concentrated on providing specialized brokerage 
services to wealthy individuals. And that fits perfectly with Cruttenden's plan 
to build a bigger firm that can draw more clients into purchasing stock in 
companies that Cruttenden helps to secure financing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those companies, such as Emulex Corp. in Costa Mesa, will be on display 
Feb. 8 and 9 at Cruttenden's second annual growth stock conference. The 
conference, which is attended mostly by institutional investors, is designed to 
showcase public companies whose stock Cruttenden considers to be undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's conference drew about 100 people, including representatives from 
about 35 investment firms. This year, Cruttenden said, he expects close to 300 
representatives from about 100 investment firms, who will hear presentations 
from 41 area firms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the local banking firms scheduled at the conference are CommerceBank in 
Newport Beach, Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills, Liberty National Bank in 
Huntington Beach and PNB Financial Group in Santa Ana. Compiled by James S.

EMPLOYERS TREAT HEALTH PLAN COSTS WITH MANAGED CARE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICAL INSURANCE: COMPANIES FIND THAT THEY HAVE MORE WAYS TO CUT THE COSTS OF 
COVERAGE THAN BY DROPPING BENEFITS OR MAKING EMPLOYEES PAY MORE FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Daniels is earning $40 more a month this year without getting a payraise. 
She is taking advantage of a new twist in medical insurance benefits offered by 
her employer, Nichols Institute in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which conducts complex medical laboratory tests, this month began 
offering a "working spouse option" to married employees willing to forfeit full 
medical insurance coverage. In exchange, those employees receive more pay or 
pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, an investor relations assistant, has chosen an option under which 
Nichols insures only 20% of any of her future medical bills. Her husband's 
employer, Pacific Bell, provides coverage for other medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," Daniels said. "There is no sense for me to have extra 
coverage that I can't use or don't need. Between the two policies, I have 100% 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement also is beneficial to Nichols, which now has to spend only $140 
a month -- instead of $400 -- to provide health insurance coverage to Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
The Nichols program, a type of flexible benefits plan, is just one example of 
steps that companies nationwide are taking in an effort to place a check on 
medical premium costs, which consultants say have been rising about 20% a year 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms are cutting costs by shifting to preferred provider and health 
maintenance organizations (PPOs and HMOs), hiring specialists in handling 
mental health and drug abuse cases, and offering exercise and other programs to 
improve their workers' health. 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Feldstein, a professor at the UC Irvine Graduate School of Management, 
said that companies have more alternatives to cut employee medical costs than 
just dropping benefits or making employees pay more for them. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of companies get so frustrated by the issue that they will drop 
dependent coverage or increase co-insurance and deductibles rather than find 
how to more efficiently provide the same level of benefits," said Feldstein, 
who will speak today at a health benefits conference sponsored by the Orange 
County branch of the Merchants and Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He encourages companies to offer employees HMO and PPO plans. In contrast to 
the traditional insurance plans that let employees choose their doctors and 
hospitals, these managed health care programs seek to direct patients to the 
most cost-effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Employees are enticed to join managed care programs for the chance to reduce or 
eliminate their out-of-pocket costs in the form of deductibles and co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have switched exclusively to managed health care. Advanced 
Controls Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of machines used in making 
printed-circuit boards, contracted with a PPO last May. 
</P>
<P>
The company was seeking to avoid a 96% increase in the cost of its previous 
insurance plan, which paid a percentage of all medical bills regardless of 
which doctor or hospital an employee chose. Now everyone at the company is 
restricted to a pre-approved list of doctors who have agreed to provide 
discounted services. 
</P>
<P>
"Even my family had to change doctors as a result of our new program," said 
Robert W. Quest, the company's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Swiftly gaining popularity are the kind of PPO plans that allow employees to go 
to a doctor or hospital outside the plan -- if they pay an out-of-pocket 
premium for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Hannifin Corp.'s aerospace unit in Irvine offers such a "swing" plan to 
all of its 4,000 employees in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Moreover, the 
company has created its own case-management network, hiring physicians and 
nurses to review treatment plans. 
</P>
<P>
Currently 60% of Parker Hannifin's employees have joined the swing plan and 
choose to use pre-selected doctors and hospitals 80% of the time, said Joyce 
Munsell, the company's medical resources manager. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are offering "flexible benefits" programs that allow employees 
to tailor their medical benefits to individual needs. 
</P>
<P>
These companies in some cases are giving employees a certain amount of money to 
buy the medical benefit plans they want or feel they can afford. Under federal 
tax rules, money earmarked for medical expenses can be deducted from the 
employee's income, thus reducing both the employee's income taxes and the 
employer's payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an outstanding opportunity for the employer to do something for the 
employee," said John Word, president of Word and Brown Inc., an Orange 
wholesale broker of health insurance to small companies. Such tax breaks, he 
said, can make the employee's growing role in funding medical insurance "much 
more palatable." 
</P>
<P>
So far, those using flexible medical insurance plans with tax benefits have 
primarily been large companies. But Word said this year he expects "a 
tremendous number" of companies with 50 and fewer employees to jump on the 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
Under Nichols' flexible plan, an employee may be required to pay a portion of 
his medical insurance premium of up to $167 a month, or he may receive a refund 
from the company of up to $60 a month. The amount depends on the benefit 
package chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Raman Raj, the company's director of compensation and benefits, said he has 
revamped Nichols' medical benefits since he took his job a year ago. Since 
then, he said, the company has cut administrative costs and added many options, 
including a PPO. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Raj said, this year his company does not expect its medical 
benefit costs to rise. "If we hadn't done these things, rates would have gone 
up 15% to 20%, at least," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But flexible benefits plans have drawn criticism. Gary Golden, president of 
Insurance Alternatives, an employee benefits brokerage in Irvine, predicts that 
letting employees choose to drop some medical insurance benefits will gradually 
cause the cost of those benefits to rise. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds wonderful," he said. "But as soon as you allow employees to pick and 
choose what they want, it drives the healthy employees out of the plan. I think 
it is a stopgap measure that ultimately will cost employers more money because 
of increasing adverse selection." 
</P>
<P>
Golden contends that to lower the cost of medical insurance, more employees 
need to be insured, not fewer, in order to spread the financial risk. As of 
1987, the last year for which data is available, 23% of American workers aged 
18 to 64 had no employer-subsidized group medical benefits and 16% had no 
medical benefits at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to contain costs until there is some mechanism of getting all 
employers to pay a decent share," Golden said. "If everyone did, the cost per 
person would be lower." 
</P>
<P>
Companies nationwide are especially dismayed by a leap in the cost of insurance 
to treat mental illness and chemical dependency -- which increased 27% in 1988, 
the most recent year for which there is data available. 
</P>
<P>
In response, companies are beginning to hire specialists in efficiently 
managing psychiatric and alcohol- and drug-abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1988, Lifelink, a Laguna Hills company that specializes 
in managing psychiatric and chemical dependency cases, has enrolled 200,000 
employees in its plan. Almost half were added in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies also are instituting "wellness programs" including exercise 
rooms and smoking cessation counseling, in an effort to cut future medical 
costs by making workers healthier. Odetics Inc., an Anaheim electronics firm, 
has one of the most extensive health programs in the nation. It offers its 488 
employees a 6,000-square-foot exercise facility with a lap pool, as well as a 
broad range of classes ranging from yoga to the use of acupressure to reduce 
back and neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
But even if a company adopts all of the alternatives available, most 
consultants do not believe that it can hold down rising medical costs forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little bit helps. But the basic underlying fact is that the cost of 
health care is increasing by 20% a year and Orange County is one of the highest 
-- if not the highest -- cost medical areas in the country," said Michael Fox, 
who manages the Costa Mesa office of Foster Higgins, a medical benefits 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a frustrating area. The fact of the matter is nobody has a solution," 
said Richard Burrell, vice president of human resources for National Education, 
an Irvine-based vocational education company that has seen its medical costs 
rise 15% to 21% a year, even after taking cost-curbing measures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYEE MEDICAL CARE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of providing medical care, including claims and administration 
fees, for an employee it the United States has increased steadily since 1984. 
1984: $1,645. 1989 (estimate): $2,742.

RAMS FACE THE MUSIC IN BATTLE OVER BANDS 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles Rams must decide by today whether to accept a settlement, or 
face a formal complaint and hearing from the National Labor Relations Board, in 
a dispute over the team's switch last summer from union to non-union musicians 
for home games. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, proposed by the NLRB, the Rams would pay the union 
musicians who were put out of work for the season and would agree to bargain in 
good faith in the future. "They're supposed to let me know," said Neil Warheit, 
an NLRB Region 21 field attorney who investigated the complaint filed by Orange 
County Musicians' Assn. Local 7. 
</P>
<P>
Rams officials did not return phone calls to The Times on Tuesday. As outlined, 
the settlement would cost the team almost $25,000 in payments to 22 musicians 
for 11 home games, plus an undisclosed sum in benefits. The 22 musicians would 
have made $102 plus benefits for each of three exhibition games and eight 
regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams reject the settlement, the NLRB will issue a formal complaint and 
schedule a hearing before an administrative judge, to be held in two to three 
months, Warheit said. Charges against the Rams, according to Warheit, would 
include failure to bargain in good faith, refusal to provide information to the 
union and discriminating against employees because of union activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams broke off negotiations with the union in July after the union refused 
to reduce the size of the band from 22 members to 15, which Rams officials said 
would have saved them about $1,000 per game. 
</P>
<P>
The team then assembled a band of 22 non-union musicians, including some Cal 
State Long Beach students. Some of those musicians have said they were paid $50 
per game, about half the union rate and not including benefits provided under 
union contracts. 
</P>
<P>
For the previous 10 years, the team had contracted with professional players 
from the musicians' union. 
</P>
<P>
During the Rams' three home exhibition games last summer, the union hired a 
plane to tow a banner over Anaheim Stadium reading "Georgia and the Rams Unfair 
to Union Musicians" (a reference to Rams owner Georgia Frontiere). "We thought 
that would be more visible than pickets," local president Frank Amoss said. 
</P>
<P>
The union filed charges alleging unfair labor practices with the NLRB Oct. 12. 
The Rams then moved to reopen negotiations, according to Amoss, but turned down 
a union-proposed compromise of an 18-piece band, sticking with its demands for 
a reduction to 15 members. 
</P>
<P>
Talks broke off again, with union officials deciding to wait for results of the 
NLRB investigation, which was concluded early this month.

PACIFIC CHORALE STILL HASN'T PAID ORCHESTRA

The Pacific Symphony was still waiting Tuesday for $37,000 it is owed by the 
Orange County Master Chorale for having played in the chorale's Oct. 27 and 
Dec. 3 concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra was to have been paid in full on Monday, according to statements 
reaffirmed by John Rhynerson, chairman of the Costa Mesa-based chorale, last 
week when it was learned that the Pacific had pulled out of a Feb. 9 concert 
with the chorale because of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as of press time late Tuesday afternoon, the money still had not arrived, 
according to Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not heard from them," Spisto said. "At this point, we are just waiting 
to hear from them about what they are going to be able to do in the way of 
payment." 
</P>
<P>
Rhynerson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said that no action has been planned, beyond informing the Pacific's 
board of directors of the situation at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want to do anything that's harmful to the Master Chorale," 
Spisto said. "If they would only give us some clear indications of what's going 
on, we'd be delighted and be willing to work with them on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
According to Spisto, the Master Chorale had sent the orchestra a letter last 
month proposing a three-payment schedule to retire the debt, beginning Dec. 15 
and ending on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't happened," Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
The chorale plans to assemble its own orchestra for the Feb. 9 concert through 
the local musicians' union, with no change planned in the program, according to 
earlier remarks by Rhynerson. Frank Amoss, president of the union local, said a 
bond for the entire amount of musicians' salaries would be required.

PANEL PREFERS PRIVATE BODY TO BACK ARTS

Grass-roots efforts to form a countywide arts support organization moved 
forward this week when a committee of local arts officials agreed that the 
agency should be private, rather than an arm of county government. 
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc, 27-member Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council, which 
first proposed the agency, has been mulling the issue for several months. 
Private, nonprofit status would give the organization independence from county 
government while allowing it to seek private and government funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The clear majority (of committee members) felt that a private agency is more 
likely to be more effective and more consistent with the way this community 
works," said committee director Martin Weil after a meeting Monday at South 
Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, county arts support has been virtually nil. The Orange County 
Board of Supervisors never funded an Orange County Arts Alliance, the proposed 
agency's predecessor, which dissolved in 1988. But private sector support has 
been comparatively strong. Construction of the $73.3-million Orange County 
Performing Arts Center was funded solely with private money, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members, still refining an outline for the agency's structure and 
goals, hope by early next month to submit a final draft to the county, which is 
conducting a study to reevaluate its own role in arts support. 
</P>
<P>
Weil said he hopes that the outline, "a comprehensive statement as to what the 
arts community feels (are its) most critical and pressing needs," will help 
county officials to determine their next step. The county study is to be 
completed by March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Wiercioch, an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who requested the 
county study, said the committee's outline will serve as a resource. But she 
could not say whether it would have any great impact. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of organizations in the county interested in the arts, and 
there is no single body that will have disproportional influence on the county 
study," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also voted Monday to continue meeting through June, or until an 
arts support agency is established, Weil said. It will meet next after results 
of the county study are made public. Originally the committee was to have 
disbanded at the end of last month.

Donor organ flights -- Because of an editing error, a story in some editions 
Saturday incorrectly identified Harbor-UCLA Medical Center as a hospital that 
uses Van Nuys Airport for flights to retrieve donor organs for transplants.

The hospital is UCLA Medical Center. Also, a photo caption accompanying that 
story misidentified a heart transplant coordinator with Loma Linda University

Catholic population -- A background box accompanying a story in The Times on 
Monday about church closings in Chicago incorrectly stated that Roman Catholic 
Church membership in the United States had plummeted from 73 million to 53 
million in less than a decade. The information, taken from the 1990 World 
Almanac and Book of Facts, was the result of a printing error by the Almanac, 
according to Constant H. Jacquet Jr., editor of the Yearbook of American &amp; 
Canadian Churches, which was cited as the Almanac's source. U.S. Catholic 
population actually grew from 50 million in 1980 to about 55 million last year, 
Jacquet said.

A Hacienda Heights physician was acquitted today of charges he strangled his 
11-year-old son as part of a bitter custody dispute and dismembered the boy's 
body, dissecting his flesh into more than 200 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Khalid Parwez, 40, a native of Pakistan, was found not guilty by a Superior 
Court jury in Pomona of one count of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors reached their verdict on their second day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Parwez, an obstetrician and gynecologist who was on staff at Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Center in West Los Angeles, had been in custody since the slaying in 
lieu of $8-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
The junior high school student's body was discovered on Nov. 17, 1987, in 
plastic bags in a trash bin outside a Hacienda Heights apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's uncle, Sattar Ahmad, had rented an apartment in the complex four days 
earlier. Ahmad also was charged with murder but disappeared the day after the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Circumstantial evidence in the case included receipts showing that Parwez had 
purchased a sledgehammer, ax and other items shortly before the killing and his 
lack of reaction to news of his son's death.

Police shot and critically wounded a Tujunga man during a drug raid at his home 
when the man allegedly confronted narcotics officers with a gun, authorities 
said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
John Gersboll, 39, was wounded in the chest, hip and left leg during the 
shooting at 10:45 p.m. Tuesday in the 9900 block of Tujunga Canyon Boulevard, 
said Lt. William Hall, head of the LAPD's officer-involved shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
Gersboll did not fire the gun he had pointed at officers and no one else was 
injured, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Gersboll was in critical but stable condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills. Police said he will be arrested for assault with a deadly weapon 
on a peace officer when his condition permits. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man's wife, Samantha Gersboll, 43, was arrested at the home after 
the shooting when police found a machine gun and a supply of illegal 
Teflon-coated bullets, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, narcotics detectives secretly watched the home and observed 
several of what appeared to be drug transactions, police said. Officers then 
obtained a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
During a search of the house following the shooting, police found a small 
amount of methamphetamine and marijuana and an AR-15 machine gun, a silencer, 
three stolen handguns and an undisclosed quantity of Teflon-coated bullets, 
Hall said.

Charles David Rothenberg was released from prison this morning, nearly seven 
years after he burned his son beyond recognition in a twisted plot to hurt the 
wife who divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:40 a.m., Rothenberg was driven from an undisclosed California prison 
under guard by four parole agents, who delivered him to an unnamed parole 
destination sometime before 9 a.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in blue jeans and a chambray shirt and toting two boxes of personal 
belongings, a prison spokesman said Rothenberg's only remark upon release was, 
"I'm afraid and upset." While authorities refuse to identify his whereabouts 
for fear such a disclosure would result in repeated and costly relocations, 
they did say Rothenberg will hold a clerical job in private enterprise that 
will "at least pay for his room and board." 
</P>
<P>
Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said 
Rothenberg's living quarters "are essentially some type of an apartment 
setting."

Jurors wearing earphones listened today to a tape of John Gotti boasting that 
he is "boss" of the nation's most powerful Mafia family and that an admiring 
gangster called him "God's gift to the underworld." 
</P>
<P>
Gotti's description of his rise to power in the Gambino crime family is 
contained on some of the 1,001 hours of secretly taped conversations at his 
alleged Queens headquarters, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing large black earphones, the jury of seven men and five women in the 
assault case against Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerreri, 60, an alleged Gambino 
soldier, heard the tapes in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The jurors also 
were provided with transcripts prepared by the government. 
</P>

Gotti, wearing a red floral tie, matching pocket square and a black-on-black 
striped double-breasted suit, also was given a pair of earphones but he 
declined to wear them.

Gotti is accused of ordering the May 7, 1986, shooting and wounding of a 
carpenters union leader, John O'Connor. The shooting was meant as a warning to 
the union, which had trashed a Gambino-linked restaurant in a dispute over the 
use of non-union labor. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes begin in 1985, when reputed Boss of Bosses Paul Castellano was gunned 
down outside a Manhattan steakhouse Dec. 16 and Gotti allegedly assumed his 
throne. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 11, 1986, conversation with an unknown man, Gotti said his recent 
rise to power left him feeling obligated to socialize with a higher class of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and you may socialize, but I can't socialize with these guys, I can't bring 
myself down, I'm a boss, you know what I mean. . . . I gotta isolate myself a 
little bit," Gotti said, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 18, 1986, Gotti boasted to another man about the compliments lavished 
on him by an admiring gangster. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'When they say God's gift to the underworld you are it,' " Gotti 
bragged. 
</P>
<P>
"He speaks with his heart, he means it, I tell ya somethin', I love the guy," 
Gotti continued. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently not everyone in organized crime revered Gotti and the reputed 
mob boss decided to demand some respect. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 17, 1986, conversation, Gotti said his underlings had questioned his 
judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"And they come at me, and they say we're telling you now, what about this and 
what about that? Move this guy, are you gonna move us all? I said, 'Let me tell 
you fellers something. I'm right in what I just done. I could break every one 
of you captains right now, and not overstep bounds.' A new boss does that," 
Gotti said, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the tapes played today were meant to prove that Gotti is the boss of 
the crime family and has the power to call all the shots for the Gambinos. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the trial, the jury is expected to hear a tape in which Gotti 
allegedly orders O'Connor shot, saying "Bust him up," according to prosecutors.

A senior American official of the Panama Canal Commission was shot and fatally 
wounded during what appeared to be a robbery by two men at his home Tuesday 
night, a commission spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Joyce, 56, the chief financial officer for the commission, was shot 
by men who persuaded Joyce's wife, Mildred, to open the door of their home by 
mentioning the name of one of the couple's sons, said commission spokeswoman 
Willie Friar. 
</P>
<P>
Friar said at that point, "one of the two intruders opened fire immediately on 
the unarmed Joyce." 
</P>
<P>
The intruders robbed Joyce's wife of jewelry and took guns from the family's 
collection, Friar said.

A van carrying farm workers ran off a foggy rural road and slid into a canal 
today, drowning 10 people and injuring two. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and a front-seat passenger crawled out of the submerged van through 
windows, but the others were trapped in the vehicle, which ran off the road at 
a curve six miles from this farm community, sheriff's Lt. Bill Chamness said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all 12 people in the privately owned van were Mexican migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office did not receive word of the 7:30 a.m. crash until 7:46 
a.m., authorities said. The accident occurred about 100 miles northwest of 
Miami.

The victims "were still in the van when we got there," Chamness said. "They

Convicted killer Richard Angelo, a nurse who tried to become a hero by reviving 
patients he injected with lethal doses of drugs, was sentenced today to 61 1/3 
years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"During my many years on the bench, I've heard many stories of horror, but this 
is at the top of the list," said Suffolk County Court Judge Alfred Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
"The course of conduct taken by this defendant gives new meaning to the concept 
of depraved indifference," Tisch said as Angelo, 27, stood before him without 
expression, occasionally biting his lip. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo, described by the prosecution as "a monster in nurse's whites," was 
convicted Dec. 14 of two counts of second-degree murder and one count each of 
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of four patients 
from fatal injections of Pavolon, a muscle-relaxant drug. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo's parents, Joseph and Alice Angelo, sat behind him in the front row but 
showed no emotion while the judge imposed the sentence. As he spoke, Tisch 
glanced at the two retired schoolteachers and remarked to them, "It is likely 
that during the remainder of your natural life your son will be incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
As a handcuffed Angelo was being taken out of the courtroom, the son of one of 
his murder victims shouted, "Enjoy life in jail, fat boy."

A rare American heron made an epic flight across the Atlantic, then promptly 
got killed by an Irish hunting dog. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
It is a shame after surviving a flight across the Atlantic it should have met 
such an end," top Irish ornithologist Killian Mullarney said after the death of 
the bittern, a long brown heron, was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first American bittern known to have reached Ireland since 1973 so 
a lot of people, including many from Britain, would have liked to have seen it 
and must be very disappointed." It was killed in Wexford in southeast Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. bird-watchers had been planning to flock over to see the rare bird, 
which was blown off course over the Atlantic while migrating from North America 
to Central America for the winter.

Santa Fe Pacific Corp. plans to reduce employment on its railroad by 2,700 jobs 
over five years, officials of the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions will take place through job buyouts, attrition and possible 
layoffs and will affect both union and white-collar workers, according to a 
spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would likely affect Santa Fe Railway across its 11,500-mile system. 
There is no specific timetable for the cuts, which would reduce employment with 
the railroad from 18,000 to about 15,300, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Railway has been steadily reducing employment for several years. 
About three years ago, it took 85 crew members to run a Santa Fe train from 
Chicago to Los Angeles. The railroad currently uses 40 crew members on the same 
run, and company officials expect to cut that number to about 30, the spokesman 
said.

In its first purchase of Western commercial aircraft, the Soviet airline 
Aeroflot has ordered five Airbus A-310-300 wide-bodied jets, Airbus Industrie 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Airbus, a Western European aircraft manufacturing consortium, 
declined to disclose the value of the order. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft industry sources said the contract is worth about $310 million. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus Managing Director Jean Pierson said the Aeroflot order represents "the 
new kind of relations between Eastern Europe and Western Europe." 
</P>
<P>
State-owned Aeroflot also has taken an option to buy five additional Airbus 
jets, Airbus officials said. Each plane can carry 195 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The planes will be delivered between November, 1991, and June, 1992, and will 
be used for Aeroflot's flights between the Soviet Union and the Far East, 
Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Aksenov, the Soviet Union's civil aviation vice minister, told 
reporters in Toulouse that Aeroflot is holding talks with Western European 
airlines on a maintenance contract for the new jets. 
</P>
<P>
A full maintenance base in the Soviet Union would be uneconomical for such a 
small number of planes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aeroflot must still choose between General Electric or Pratt and Whitney 
engines to power the aircraft.

FED SAYS SLOW GROWTH TO PERSIST IN ECONOMY

The nation's economy continued to grow slowly as it entered the new year and is 
expected to continue that expansion throughout 1990, the Federal Reserve Board 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Economy activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation, with conditions 
somewhat stronger in the West than in the East," the central bank said in a 
survey of its 12 districts completed Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales varied during the Christmas shopping period, ranging from 
"disappointing" in Boston to modest in Philadelphia and Atlanta and relatively 
strong in Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But the report added, "Widespread discounting generally reduced store profits." 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing activity is generally sluggish, with production declines in some 
industries (autos, in particular) offsetting gains in others (such as 
commercial aircraft and oil field equipment)," the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"Several districts reported that the steel and computer industries, among 
others, may be 'bottoming out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Fed's 12 district banks was conducted in preparation for the 
Feb. 6-7 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 
monetary policy-setting arm. It was compiled in what is known as the "Beige 
Book" by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The slow economy has resulted from the Fed's battle to drive interest rates 
higher as a way of dampening demand and cooling off inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed switched course last June and has permitted short-term rates to drop 
gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy from stopping altogether and 
falling into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But the central bank has not acted since then and just last week, the White 
House broke its usual no-comment stance on Fed activities and said "lower 
interest rates are justified." 
</P>
<P>
As is usual, today's report by the Fed carried no recommendations, but said, 
"The outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 1990; some respondents expect 
improvement late in the year." 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, the report's summary said, "Unseasonably cold weather dampened 
construction activity in some areas, but real estate markets generally held 
steady. Cold or dry weather also adversely affected citrus, vegetable and 
winter wheat crops. Other agricultural and resource-related sectors did 
moderately well."

Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich said Tuesday he is returning to the Soviet 
Union for a concert tour next month with feelings of "enormous emotion" but 
rejected any notion that he might end 16 years of exile in the West. 
Rostropovich, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, said he and 
his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, were happy that Soviet authorities had 
"admitted their mistake" and decided to restore the citizenship stripped from 
them in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But Rostropovich made clear during a session with reporters at the Kennedy 
Center that the couple has no intention of abandoning their life in the West 
and returning permanently to their homeland. Rostropovich repeated his 
assertion last week that "the almost 16 years spent in the West since our exile 
do not yet allow us to change our lives again."

Baron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen, the West German steel billionaire, is moving

sell Villa Favorita, his home-cum-museum, to the town but officials declined to 
comment on reports that the asking price is $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The baron also failed to convince both Lugano and Swiss federal authorities 
that they should contribute to the cost of extending the villa if they want his 
art collection to remain in Switzerland. Last year Thyssen decided to move the 
most important works in his priceless collection to Madrid, his wife's 
hometown. Unlike Switzerland, Spain readily agreed to build an extension to the 
Prado museum to house the 1,400-painting collection, which is ranked second 
only in the world to that of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.

KATHLEEN TURNER RETURNS AS 'MAGGIE' IN 'HOT TIN ROOF'

Actress Kathleen Turner said Tuesday she's thrilled to be back on stage, 
particularly in a role she's yearned to play for years. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is starring as Maggie in Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize-winning drama began a two-week run Tuesday at Pittsburgh's 
Benedum Center. After that, it goes to Boston, Philadelphia and then Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is in the material, not in doing stage . . . versus film per 
se," Turner said at a news conference. Turner said she always had intended to 
portray Williams' Maggie, a beautiful Southern woman who pines for a husband 
who shuns her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite delightful to play her. It's so alive to me to always be thinking. 
She changes so fast and thinks so fast. I like the level of aliveness." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Turner in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" are Charles Durning, Polly 
Holliday and Daniel Hugh Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The current production, which is Williams' original version, is quite unlike 
the altered 1955-56 Broadway production starring Barbara Bel Geddes, Ben 
Gazzara and Burl Ives. It's also nothing like the 1958 film with Elizabeth 
Taylor, Paul Newman and Ives. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said she purposely avoided seeing the earlier productions, except for 
the 1958 film. 
</P>
<P>
"I make a point of trying not to see roles that I will probably do because I 
don't want any other images in my mind. I want to create it fresh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 35, a native of Missouri, started in theater but it was movies that 
made her a star. She's appeared in more than a dozen films, including "Body 
Heat," "Romancing the Stone," "Prizzi's Honor," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and 
"The Accidental Tourist."

There's no truth to the rumors that Michael Jackson's chimpanzee Bubbles has 
died, Jackson's publicist announced, and "when Bubbles heard about his demise 
he went bananas." 
</P>
<P>
"Like Mark Twain, his death is grossly exaggerated and he's alive and doing 
well," publicist Lee Solters said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A fire in Jackson's Santa Barbara menagerie last month destroyed a giraffe 
barn, but the animals were evacuated safely. Jackson's private zoo includes 
ostriches, llamas and boa constrictors.

Sylvester Stallone brings boxer Rocky Balboa home from the Soviet Union on a 
real Soviet airliner in "Rocky V," taking advantage of glasnost to film the 
latest chapter of his pugilistic saga. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone, whose character battled a Soviet boxer in "Rocky IV," filmed Monday 
at the Philadelphia International Airport with the captain and crew of an 
Aeroflot jet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing because six months ago this was totally impossible. It's truly 
astounding," Stallone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ilyushin 86, which arrived from Moscow on Sunday, was the first Soviet 
aircraft used in the production of an American film, movie publicists said. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone said some moviegoers misunderstood the message of "Rocky IV," in which 
Rocky defeated a Soviet boxer. "The real story at the end of 'Rocky IV' was we 
can all get along," he said.

NOW HERE'S a scoop coming in Parade magazine this very Sunday -- a profile of 
Jesse Jackson by Edward Klein. This was written about five weeks ago for 
deadline, but Klein says the news is still viable and fresh. Jesse Jackson, it 
seems, is searching for a way NOT to run for President in 1992. And he doesn't 
want to be the next mayor of D.C. either. What Jesse wants is to become the 
senator from the largely black state of "New Columbia" and he says, in the 
future, he is going to make statehood for the District "the highest civil 
rights issue in the country." A 51st state?

EL STORK! Actor Roy Scheider and his wife, Brenda, a former documentary 
filmmaker, welcomed a 7 1/2 pound boy in a New York hospital last Saturday. His 
name is Christian Verrier Scheider. Daddy is famous for his roles in "Jaws" and 
"All That Jazz." He has just finished filming "Russia House." . . . Another 
marvelous actor, John Hurt (he made "The Naked Civil Servant" and "Scandal" to 
name just two of his movies) and his live-in love, Jo Dalton, marry this very 
day at the Westminster Town Hall in London. After the ceremony, the Hurts will 
go to honeymoon in a nearby London hospital, awaiting the arrival any second of 
their first-born. This is called planned parenthood -- I guess.

BARBARA WALTERS is just back from Czechoslovakia, interviewing the new

</P>
<P>
So Barbara turned right around and did also interview America's most famous

Inside, Trump speaks candidly about personal loyalty, politics and the decline 
of America. "I like George Bush very much," he says to reporter Glenn Plaskin, 
"but I disagree with him when he talks of a kinder, gentler America. I think if 
this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to 
exist. . . . The Japanese double-screw the U.S., a real trick. First they take 
all our money with their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of 
Manhattan. So either way, we lose." There's a lot more!

Tailback Terry Allen has withdrawn from school, but Clemson's second-leading 
all-time rusher has not decided whether he will play his senior year or turn 
pro, a university spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
If he opts to leave, Allen would be the third junior to forgo his senior season 
for a chance at the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, one of the best players in the country, and 
Arkansas fullback Barry Foster have both announced they will turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Allen can still go to summer school and be eligible to 
play for the Tigers this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Annabelle Vaughan, assistant sports information director, said that Allen had 
been thinking about withdrawing since December and that the resignation of 
Coach Danny Ford last week and the hiring of Ken Hatfield this week as the 
school's new head football coach did not prompt the decision.

The president of Little League Inc., concerned about exploitation of

halt its public appearances or risk losing its charter. 
</P>

Creighton Hale, president of the Little League Inc. in Williamsport, Pa., said 
he wants to see everything come to a halt, John DelVecchio, president of the 
Trumbull Little League, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hale is concerned about exploitation, said DelVecchio, who has canceled the 
team's appearance at the Connecticut Sports Writers' Alliance Gold Key dinner 
on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, in a statement, said the youngsters are not grown men and they really 
aren't great athletes. "We need to protect them from what adults sometimes do, 
which is over-glorify them for the things they sometimes accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Galla, whose squad became the first American team to win the Little 
League World Series since 1983, said he welcomes the directive from 
Williamsport.

Japanese major league team recently offered to buy an interest in the Durham 
Bulls after seeing the movie about the minor league club, but Bulls President 
Miles Wolff said the team is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said the Japanese team worked through a contact in Greensboro to 
negotiate a possible purchase of the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said he does not know which Japanese team is interested in his Class-A 
franchise, and he would not name the contact in Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for sale," he said. "They were really interested in getting a 
Triple-A team, so now I've been talking more to them in terms of what Triple-A 
teams might be available." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said his Greensboro contact told him the Japanese club became interested 
in the Bulls through "Bull Durham," a box-office smash in the summer of 1988 
that was set in Durham. 
</P>
<P>
"The factor for them was that we might have a chance down the road to go 
Triple-A," Wolff said. "But I don't think they realized that we were in the 
situation of trying to get a new stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff and the Bulls are awaiting the results of a proposed $11.28-million bond 
issue for a new downtown stadium. A referendum is set for March 13.

The last time Yannick Noah made a Grand Slam semifinal, he went on to win the 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
It's taken all this time for the Frechman to come within reach of another Grand 
Slam title, to deal with the pressure he put on himself and the expectations 
others have of him. 
</P>
<P>
Noah was in command tonight as he beat Sweden's Mikael Pernfors 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 
in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Pernfors, the Swedish-born former 
NCAA champion, made the quarters on the default of John McEnroe. Originally, 
Noah seemed destined for a quarterfinal match against John McEnroe -- a player 
he's never beaten in four tries. But McEnroe's disqualification for misconduct 
in the fourth round left the 12th-seeded Noah in a fine position. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it was a good break for me," Noah said. "When John lost, I told him 
I was kind of happy. On the other side, I was a little sad because of what 
happened. I think he understood." 
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked player -- Ivan Lendl -- stands between Noah and the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't keeping Noah awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl leads Noah 10-7 in career meetings, but Noah won their last match two 
weeks ago in Sydney en route to his first tournament title of the year. 
</P>
<P>
If Noah wins the Australian Open, he feels he is better prepared to handle the 
pressure the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to winning. The rest is easy," the 29-year-old Noah said. "When 
you're young, you take it for granted. Being out of the big matches for a long 
time helps me appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Noah is playing with his old passion for the game. His renewed interest is 
encouraging because last year it looked as if he might be gone for good. 
</P>
<P>
"Five months ago I was thinking about stopping playing," Noah said. "I didn't 
think I could win a match. And now I'm in the semifinals." 
</P>
<P>
Other matches, C3.

ALL THE PRESSURE IS ON S.F., BRONCO PLAYERS SAY

They know most of America expects them to get soundly beaten in Super Bowl 
XXIV. Yet, the Denver Broncos, those 12-point underdogs from the AFC, aren't 
acting like a club headed for the guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
During the team photo-and-interview session Tuesday at the Superdome, the 
Broncos acted like a carefree team with nothing to lose and portrayed the San 
Francisco 49ers as a team with the weight of the world on its shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to be the (1980) U.S. hockey team against the Russians," a 
relaxed Coach Dan Reeves said. "The 49ers have an opportunity to grab a piece 
of history, be the first team in 10 years to win back-to-back championships and 
the second to win four. We have a tremendous opportunity to alter history." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got nothing to lose," added John Elway, sitting in a chair with his legs 
crossed. "They're the dynasty with all the pressure. All we have to do is go 
out and play. We're having fun because we don't have a chance to win this game 
according to you guys." 
</P>
<P>
The point spread for Sunday's showdown is the largest since the Kansas City 
Chiefs were a 13-point underdog in Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings. 
The largest spread ever came in Super Bowl III when the Joe Namath-led New York 
Jets were 18-point underdogs to the mighty Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are well aware that the Chiefs and Jets both emerged as surprise 
winners. "There's nothing wrong with being the underdog," running back Sammy 
Winder said. "It (the point spread) has nothing to do with what happens 
Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have been constantly reminded this week of their 0-3 record in 
Super Bowls, including blowouts of 39-20 to the New York Giants in Super Bowl 
XXI and 42-10 to the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII. Should they lose 
Sunday, the Broncos would tie the Vikings for the most Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Broncos think this year's team is the best of their Super Bowl 
entries in the last decade. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, they 
have a simpler, more physical defense. The Broncos also have a respectable 
running game that should take pressure off Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best team we've brought to the Super Bowl," Elway said. "We're 
bigger, we're better on defense and we have a better running game. But we're 
playing the best team we've played in a Super Bowl."

GAINES' TOUGHEST JOB: VISITING CHUCKIE MULLINS;

As Brad Gaines walked through the doors of Baptist Memorial Hospital in 
Memphis, the knot in his stomach felt as if it were going to explode. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day after the Liberty Bowl game between Ole Miss and Air Force. For 
Gaines, a fullback at Vanderbilt, the uncertainty of his mission had been 
building. His palms sweated as he searched for the hospital directory. 
</P>
<P>
For an athlete who prides himself on handling adversity, it was one of the most 
difficult times in Gaines' life. He was on his way to see Chuckie Mullins, Ole 
Miss defensive back who suffered a broken neck while tackling Gaines during a 
game in Oxford, Miss., on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines had wanted to visit Mullins the week after the injury, but Vanderbilt 
Coach Watson Brown called doctors and was told it was too soon and could prove 
too traumatic for Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three months, Gaines struggled with the emotional battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be asleep at night and wake up and think to myself, 'I wonder if Chuckie 
has forgiven me. Or if he ever will.' I feel like I've been in jail ever since 
this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines was directed to the fourth floor. He emerged from the elevator to see 
about 50 people, Ole Miss fans who wanted to visit Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines introduced himself to Mullins' guardian, Carver Phillips, and softly 
asked if he could visit Chuckie alone. He walked into the room and realized for 
the first time the severity of Mullins' injury. Seeing Mullins tethered to 
tubes and monitors was almost too much, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins's eyes finally caught Gaines and for a brief moment, the visitor had to 
look away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to look straight at him," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines remembers that his rambling monologue dealt mainly with small talk. He 
did all the talking because Mullins was attached to a respirator that prevented 
him from making anything more than guttural sounds. He talked about the 
weather, the hospital, his flight to Memphis, the football season, everything 
except the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind was just flying," he said. "I thought to myself, 'This is incredible.' 
I looked at his chest and you think of football players as heavily muscled. But 
Chuckie had lost so much weight, well, it was as if his chest had atrophied. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the worst things is not knowing what he was thinking," Gaines said. "I 
was afraid to dig deep, to talk about the injury. I didn't want to upset him. I 
didn't want to do anything to make him uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
They spent about half an hour together. After leaving the room, Gaines thanked 
Phillips for his kindness and left. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was really tough, seeing Chuckie and all. But the thing I 
couldn't get out of my mind as I was leaving was if Chuckie had some way 
forgiven me." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines hesitated, shook his head, then said, "I don't think I'll ever know." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines can't shake the recollection of the tackle and the sight of Mullins 
being taken from the field strapped to a stretcher. There are constant 
reminders. He saw the incident replayed on television Nov. 25. He saw it again 
at halftime of the Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks before he made the visit, Gaines was in his dorm room after a 
pleasant evening. Football was over and Gaines was relaxed. He turned on the TV 
and settled on SportsLook, a talk show hosted by Roy Firestone. The subject: 
serious football-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines heard Firestone say, "And down at the University of Mississippi, Chuckie 
Mullins. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Tatum, a former player with the then-Oakland Raiders, was on the show. 
Tatum put New England Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley in a wheelchair 
for life with a vicious hit. Tatum reportedly never visited Stingley while he 
was in the hospital. Gaines said he finds it hard to believe anyone would be 
that uncaring. 
</P>
<P>
"How could he not go?" Gaines said. "Seeing Chuckie was one of the hardest 
things I've ever done, but I wanted to do it. I had to do it. I couldn't have 
lived with myself if I hadn't seen him because not a day goes by that I don't 
think about him." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines said he will stay in touch with Mullins and will do anything he can to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a caring person. I hate what happened to Chuckie. I see that play over and 
over. I went up for the pass and I thought I was going to score." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines caught the ball at the 2, but Mullins stopped him in his tracks. Gaines 
fumbled but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Man, what a hit.' You know you're going to get hit when you catch 
one over the middle. That's tough territory. I looked around and he was down. 
He stayed down."

WHY SENIORS TOUR? NICKLAUS, 50, PONDERS; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: 'NO MATTER WHAT I AM, I'M A GOLFER FIRST. I LOVE COMPETITION MORE THAN 
ANYTHING I DO. I GET REALLY CHARGED UP. IT'S THE EGO FACTOR. . . .' 
</P>

As golf legend Jack Nicklaus undergoes the transformation from Golden Bear to 
Golden Oldie, he is struck by a difficult question. 
</P>
<P>
What does he gain by playing on the Seniors Tour, which is filled with players 
he regularly defeated but are now loaded for bear? Nicklaus, who turned 50 
Sunday, will compete in his first seniors tournament this weekend, the $450,000 
Seniors Skins Game in Hawaii. Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Gary Player are in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," Nicklaus said. "I suppose there are two or three 
things that would fall into that category. No matter what I am, I'm a golfer 
first. I love competition more than anything I do. I get really charged up. 
It's the ego factor that I'll go out (on the tour). That's what kept me out 
after I won the Masters (in 1986), figuring lightning might strike again." 
</P>
<P>
But lightning hasn't struck since, though Nicklaus doggedly insists he still 
belongs on the regular PGA Tour. He will test that resolve extensively in the 
next few months. Commitments to 30 under-construction golf courses will take 
him back to the business world in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Financially is certainly not the reason I'm playing," said Nicklaus. His 
Golden Bear conglomerate reportedly makes up to $400 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf has ceased to be my way of making my living for the last 15 years. I 
think the majority of golfing people are looking forward to me and Trevino and 
others coming out. I think I would be kicking them in the face if I didn't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But he would be admitting defeat if he fled the regular tour. He isn't ready to 
do that. He may never be. If he thought like that, he might have changed 
direction in 1980. He became 40, a more traumatic milestone than 50, he says. 
He was also coming off what he called a terrible year. At 39, he won a mere 
$59,434 after winning at least $244,000 the previous eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He dealt with the disappointment and rallied boldly to win the 1980 U.S. Open 
and the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the 1980s, as business became so many sand traps and back problems 
hindered his backswing, his attention turned from golf. Playing an abbreviated 
schedule last year, he won $96,595. His best showings came where his best 
showings have always come -- in majors. He has won 20 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he says, is the first since he was 40 that he has set concrete golf 
goals -- winning a tournament on each tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not decided in my own mind that I can't play on the regular tour. If 
you look at the majors (last year), which are the ones I really get ready for, 
only about five American golfers beat me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tee it up, I play it as a game. It doesn't make any difference whether 
it's for 10 cents or a million dollars. You go out, pull the club back and see 
if you can do it better than anyone else. But I just can't do it as well as I 
used to. I want to be competitive. I don't want to go out there and embarrass 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus has been characterized as someone who, when he reaches the top of a 
mountain, immediately starts looking for another mountain. He longs to regain 
that passion. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't looked for many of those mountains for about 10 years. That's been a 
problem for me. I suppose this year, the one thing that has happened is I'm 
physically better than I've been in the past few years. My back has been very 
good. I've been able to do some of the things I want to do, running, lifting 
weights. I'm in pretty darn good shape for someone my age, even for someone 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can go out and play and practice earlier. It's exciting. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus may be learning that life begins at 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm 50, there is nothing I can do about it. And I'm happy to be 
there, incidentally."

</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE OUTSPOKEN FORMER ACTRESS, WHO IS THE INDUSTRY'S HIGHEST-RANKING 
FEMALE EXECUTIVE, IS TRYING TO BALANCE HER CAREER SUCCESS AGAINST ITS TOLL ON 
HER PERSONAL LIFE.

<P>
It was the end of the TV season, and Lynn Loring didn't want to be a studio 
executive any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Loring, the child actress who grew up to be president of MGM/UA Television 
Productions, was not having a good day. Six months into a three-year contract 
to fill one of Hollywood's most powerful positions, Loring was announcing her 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be my last three years," Loring said emphatically during a 
conversation last July. "I'm coming to a time in my life when I'm not finding 
it to be the fun I thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a golden age for television," Loring continued, staring pensively 
into the nearly deserted breakfast room of the Four Seasons Hotel with eyes as 
round and wide as those of her childhood publicity stills, cigarette smoke 
framing her face along with her curly russet hair. "The show has gone out of 
it, and we're left with the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to grow up to be president of a studio." 
</P>
<P>
But that was July -- following a TV season that was about as much fun as a car 
wreck for Hollywood's producers. Besides the devastation of the writers strike, 
the 1988-89season resulted in two casualties for MGM/UA: Its NBC series "Baby 
Boom" died quickly and "Dream Street," a youth-oriented, blue-collar drama from 
"thirtysomething" executive producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick, lasted 
only a few episodes. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the new season began in September, however, Loring had decided that 
being president of a major TV studio just might be a decent way to make a 
living after all. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's "thirtysomething," which had walked away with the Emmy Award for 
outstanding drama in its first season, had just netted 17 Emmy nominations (it 
went on to win two major Emmys), and Loring had high hopes for the studio's new 
ABC drama, "The Young Riders," a sort of new-age Western about the teen-age 
riders of the Pony Express. The studio had also just inked a development 
agreement with Dan Curtis, producer and director of the ABC miniseries "The 
Winds of War" and its mammoth sequel, "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
And Loring -- who had vowed to renounce her studio presidency to become an 
independent producer, or a lawyer, or the president of a network, or an author, 
or a ski bum -- now declared herself back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is, at the beginning of the year, you don't examine yourself," 
she said. "At the beginning of the season, when everybody is up and has all 
these ideas, it's like having Mounds Bars and Almond Joy and Eskimo Pies -- 
this feast of sugar. By the end of that season, the sugar is starting to wear 
off, and you have the sugar lows." 
</P>
<P>
Now at mid-season, MGM/UA has no new crises to deal with, since its shows -- 
"thirtysomething," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Young Riders" -- have all 
been picked up for the remainder of the season. There is little time to enjoy 
the success, however: Pilots for new shows are being developed. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the Top 10 shows, nothing new is really (a hit)," Loring said. 
"It's a tough year." "I guess the basic question none of us can answer is: Why 
do we do this?" 
</P>
<P>
Loring has become the most highly placed woman executive currently at a 
Hollywood television studio without ever really figuring that out. 
</P>
<P>
Second in command to MGM/UA Television Productions Chairman and CEO David 
Gerber, Loring does not carry the same clout in the TV business as former 
Columbia Pictures' president Dawn Steel did in the feature-film industry, and 
Barbara Corday outranked Loring when Corday served as president and chief 
executive officer of Columbia Pictures Television in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at least in terms of title, Loring's at the top among female TV 
executives at the studios -- and, although Gerber's the boss, Loring and Gerber 
make most decisions as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at it as something I've accomplished for all womanhood," she 
said. "But in my position, I have an obligation to stand up and be counted. I'm 
not looking to be a spokesperson for women, but I find what I say matters, and 
that excites me." 
</P>
<P>
They say life imitates art; in the case of a studio executive, life apparently 
imitates TV. Loring readily acknowledges that her decision to get off the 
executive roller coaster -- and to get back on again -- is part of an annual 
ritual that mirrors the ups and downs of each TV season. 
</P>
<P>
In one way or another, television has dedicated the pattern for most of 
Loring's life. 
</P>
<P>
At age 6, she landed a guest appearance in CBS' anthology series "Studio One," 
which ran from 1948-58. At 7, she became a spokeschild for RCA Victor; her TV 
commercials won her the moniker "The Junior Set's Betty Furness." From 6 to 16, 
she played Patty on "Search for Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
After years of guest appearances on shows including "Playhouse 90," "Hallmark 
Hall of Fame" and "The Defenders," and study at New York City's Barnard 
College, Loring married actor Roy Thinnes in 1968. They divorced in 1984; 
Loring married attorney Michael Bergman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And, aside from occasional guest roles, Loring played housewife and mother 
until 1979 -- when Thinnes, disturbed that his wife seemed to be descending 
into a routine of soap-opera watching and apathy, encouraged her to go back to 
work. Producer Curtis, for whom Loring had worked as a child, invited her to 
became casting director for his NBC movie "Raid on Coffeyville" and that 
network's "Supertrain," the 1979 anthology series described in one TV 
dictionary as "one of the most expensive failures in the history of network 
television." 
</P>
<P>
After "Supertrain," Loring joined Aaron Spelling Productions, a partnership 
that grew out of a friendship with Spelling developed during her days as an 
actress. During a week when "I was really depressed and thinking about what my 
life was going to be," Loring called Spelling and asked him to help her launch 
a TV movie based on the book "The Best Little Girl in the World," about an 
anorexic teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Spelling liked the idea, and took it to ABC. They liked it too. Before making 
Loring producer of the movie, however, he insisted she get her feet wet by 
producing a two-hour movie called "Return of the Mod Squad" (husband Thinnes 
played a role in the movie). After that, Spelling asked Loring to stay with the 
company as vice president of development and talent, motion pictures and 
television; she later created a feature-film division for the company, which 
produced the hit "Mr. Mom." 
</P>
<P>
Hence Loring's tendency to respond to TV's annual schedule as the tide responds 
to the sun. "By the end of May through the beginning of July, I'm going to be 
right back into 'I hate this. I never want to do this again,' " Loring said. To 
put it mildly, Loring tends to be blunt about all of the frustrations of the TV 
business -- including her conflicts with others with whom she has worked. Where 
the public statements of some studio executives remain as sterile as a press 
release, Loring ruffles feathers. Big feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Take Spelling's feathers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Although quick to credit Spelling for teaching her the TV basics ("I got my 
B.A. from Spelling, and my master's degree from Gerber."), Loring is equally 
quick to bite back when attacked by her former mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Spelling was recently quoted as criticizing MGM/UA's "thirtysomething" as 
"whiny" (hardly the first time anyone has offered that opinion). Loring was 
quoted as saying that Spelling had abused his immense power by turning out 
titillating trash like NBC's short-lived "Nightingales" instead of quality 
programs. "Speaking as a woman, not as an executive, I find that show 
offensive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Loring winced when reminded of those comments -- although she said she would 
have made them to Spelling's face. "That's what I meant about my being too 
honest," she said. "The person who was angriest was Gerber. He said: 'Why was 
it important for you to go on the record that way? . . . You are the most 
self-destructive person on the planet!' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Aaron Spelling Productions has recently optioned the first screenplay 
written by Loring's 21-year-old son, Christopher Thinnes, a UCLA student who 
also works for "Young Riders" producer Jonas McCord's Paragon Productions, 
Loring is still critical of Spelling. She and Spelling parted in 1984 because, 
she said, she no longer wanted to produce featherweight projects such as the 
series "Glitter," "Sizzle" and "Portrait of a Male Model." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided, what does it mean that I'm taking his paycheck, when I'm producing 
projects that I don't have a passion for?" Loring said. "That's selling out. I 
wouldn't sell myself out to get a show on the air, I just wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Loring says now that she no longer blames Spelling for all of his choices, 
since many of them were handed down by the networks. "They kept coming to him 
for more and more 'Aaron Spelling' kind of shows, and it was very easy for him 
to keep doing it. In all fairness to him, he kept trying to push for more 
uplifting television." Through his publicist, Spelling declined to respond to 
Loring's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Loring also had a few complaints about "Baby Boom" star Kate Jackson. Bad 
publicity about Jackson's temperamental behavior dogged that production from 
the beginning. "She should have lost her SAG card," Loring said indignantly. 
"It was the most unprofessional behavior I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Like Spelling, Jackson refused comment, but NBC Entertainment president Brandon 
Tartikoff said: "I would say that at any given time, there is an actor or an 
actress walking off some set somewhere. That's, like, standard -- when you hear 
about it, your blood pressure doesn't even go up one decimal. I can't comment 
on the day-to-day -- but from where I sit, I didn't find anything extraordinary 
about her (Jackson's) behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber believes Loring is learning to temper her outspokenness. "I chide her 
about it -- and she laughs, because I'm pretty outspoken myself," Gerber said. 
"There is a thin line between being irate and outspoken, and being shrill or 
blatant. I think, over the years, she has understood that. She did learn a lot 
from Aaron, and I think she has good feelings about him." 
</P>
<P>
Loring believes that most producers face the same pressures as Spelling in TV's 
increasingly grim economic landscape. She shuddered when recalling that Lee 
Iacocca recently referred to television shows as nothing more than "window 
dressing" to sell products. "Is that what I've become, window dressing for 
Chrysler?" she asked bleakly. 
</P>
<P>
"If 'thirtysomething' were being launched today, I wonder if the network could 
afford to take a chance on it?," Loring continued. "With the advertising dollar 
getting softer and softer, and people clicking their clickers all the time, 
would people even tune into that? It gets harder every year. And you can't make 
a show if it's fiscally irresponsible for the company, even if the network 
wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Loring expects to go into independent production. In the meantime, 
a reflective Loring has begun trying to balance the pluses of her career 
success against its toll on her personal life -- and is not sure she's come out 
ahead. Her first marriage ended, she said, because of her career, and she 
remains wracked with guilt over time lost with daughter Casey, now 13. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984, I was divorced and (left) my job with Aaron Spelling within 24 
hours," she said. "It was a wonderful week -- a week I'll never forget and 
never want to repeat. 'Mr. Mom' was in many ways what was going on in my 
personal life. . . . In the movie, (Michael) Keaton and (Teri) Garr got back 
together even though her career was going better. In real life, Roy and Lynn 
split up because of what was going on with her career, and didn't live happily 
ever after. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask, do I balance my life well? Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
New husband Bergman, she said, is more tolerant of her personal -- and 
financial -- independence. In sort of a paraphrase of Scarlett O'Hara, Loring 
declared: "I'll never ask a man if I can buy six pairs of shoes again! 
</P>
<P>
"What happened (with Thinnes) is that I changed the rules of the marriage well 
into it, and it was a new package that neither of us had agreed to. I was very 
fortunate to meet a man who knows this package. And this package is a woman 
who's passionate about her work; unfortunately, that's a major priority of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when being Mrs. Roy Thinnes was enough for me. Being in a new 
marriage, being Mrs. Michael Bergman isn't enough for me. It's important for me 
to be Lynn Loring."

PAROLE: RELEASE OF A NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL LIKE CHARLES ROTHENBERG RAISES 
COMMUNITY CONCERN -- AND TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a spring night in 1983, Charles Rothenberg poured kerosene around the bed 
where his 6-year-old son David slept in a Buena Park motel. He then lit a match 
and fled. Moments later the room exploded into flames; the little boy survived, 
but his body was seared with third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
After repeated skin grafts, David, now 13, still bears scars on his arms, legs 
and face, and his fingers have been amputated to the first joint. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he and his mother, Marie Hafdahl, who has since remarried, will enter 
another traumatic phase of their ordeal. After serving 6 1/2 years in prison 
for attempted murder, arson and other crimes, Charles Rothenberg, 49, begins a 
three-year parole at an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
With his release, Rothenberg joins a small group of criminals whose deeds have 
been considered so heinous that they have sent shock waves of revulsion through 
the country. When the penal system has attempted to place these ex-offenders in 
communities to serve their parole, residents have responded with virulent 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
But to what extent is that protest justified? Do the people who live in 
communities where these offenders are released need to live in fear? While 
crime victims and the townspeople who must receive especially offensive 
criminals point to high recidivism rates, experts caution that a person's prior 
criminal record and life style are better indicators of the potential for 
future crime than an individual act, no matter how heinous. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal psychologists list crimes involving torture, rape and child abuse as 
those to which people are likely to respond the most emotionally. In 
California, such community reactions have been consistent in a number of 
notorious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
* After he raped 15-year-old Mary Vincent, chopped off her forearms and dumped 
her in a canyon near Sacramento in 1978, Lawrence Singleton became one of the 
state's most reviled criminals. At the end of an eight-year prison term, 
Singleton began a celebrated parole odyssey during which prison officials 
attempted to place him in 16 Northern California communities. In an exceptional 
measure, Gov. George Deukmejian ordered him to serve the 10 remaining months of 
his one-year parole on the grounds of San Quentin prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Arthur Jackson, the deranged movie fan who stabbed Theresa Saldana 10 times 
outside her West Hollywood apartment in 1982, aroused fear and widespread 
protest when he was scheduled for parole last June. 
</P>
<P>
After Jackson's cellblock threats to complete his "divine mission" of murder 
upon his release, Saldana, the Los Angeles City Council, 60 members of the 
state Assembly and thousands of residents urged the state Board of Prison Terms 
to reverse its decision. On the basis of a window-breaking spree at the 
Vacaville prison, his parole was postponed until March, at which point Jackson 
will be deported to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
* When Dan White, a former police officer, firefighter and member of the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors, shot and killed Mayor George Moscone and 
Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, he became the object of nationwide attention. 
When he was released from prison after serving five years on a manslaughter 
conviction, thousands of San Franciscans took to the streets in protest. (After 
a secretive year's parole in the San Fernando Valley, White quietly return to 
San Francisco where he committed suicide 10 months later.) 
</P>
<P>
Fueling community fears are statistics on violent crime and recidivism. 
According to a U. S. Justice Department report published last March, 62.5% of 
all inmates released from state prisons in 1983 committed a felony or serious 
misdemeanor within three years of their release. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of those who served time for violent crimes were re-arrested for 
violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"You find a degree of specialization among offenders. They've done it in the 
past, so they're more likely to do it in the future," says Justice Department 
statistician Allen Beck. (The report stated that 6.6% of convicted murderers 
murder again; 7.7% of rapists repeat the crime.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the statistics, however, psychologists and psychiatrists involved in 
the study of criminal behavior qualify the potential danger presented by the 
release of violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"You read about a Night Stalker or a Singleton and you think the institutions 
are filled with these people," says Saul Faerstein, a Beverly Hills forensic 
psychiatrist who examined Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono. "But institutions 
are filled with common thieves and forgers." Adds Daniel Glaser, professor 
emeritus of psychology at USC, who specializes in criminology: "The fear of 
crime is not closely related to the rate of crime. It's related to the 
publicity about the crime." The chances of any one person being assaulted by a 
criminal with the notoriety of a Charles Rothenberg is roughly comparable, he 
says, to the luck of winning the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, certain types of people who are more likely to repeat 
crimes than others. Says Glaser: "The best predictor is their prior criminal 
record. If they have a history of prior crimes or alcoholism or drug addiction, 
they're more likely to repeat than if the crime was an outburst of anger in the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Faerstein: "When you find a combination of psychosexual disorder and 
sadistic disorders, these people have a high likelihood of committing heinous 
crimes. But this is a very small percentage of cases, though they are the cases 
that make the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
People who wear their crimes like a badge with no remorse are also more likely 
to repeat them than those who fear society's ostracism, Faerstein says. "They 
have a need to attract attention." 
</P>
<P>
But without detailed study of the person, both experts say, it is difficult to 
predict individual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
This is what worries Marie Hafdahl, her husband, Buena Park Police Lt. Richard 
Hafdahl, and their son, David. 
</P>
<P>
In her Buena Park home, Marie and David are trying to stave off the fear that 
could envelop them. 
</P>
<P>
David says, softly, but firmly, "I'm afraid. I don't want to see him again." 
</P>
<P>
Hafdahl is more emotional. The words fly out like sparks from a fire, as she 
tells of her four-year marriage to Rothenberg and the incident that almost 
killed David. Rothenberg had taken his son on a trip to California after their 
divorce, and, when he did not return him to his home in Brooklyn, N.Y., at the 
arranged time, Hafdahl told Rothenberg by phone that he would never see his son 
again. The same day Rothenberg bought a bottle of kerosene. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hafdahl sighs. "I'll never get over the loss David's had. It's broken my 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Nor can she get over Rothenberg's act. "I live with it every day. You don't 
hurt a child. You don't hurt your own baby. And when he's sleeping. It's 
horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
Does she consider her former husband to be dangerous? "Yes," she replies. "If 
you can do that to your own son, what would you do to a stranger?" 
</P>
<P>
Fear, whether felt by an individual or a community, is fed by noted examples in 
which criminals terrorized communities after serving time for prior offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted murderer and rapist, Willie Horton, became a focal point in President 
George Bush's campaign against Michael Dukakis after Horton violated his 
furlough from a Massachusetts prison, raped a Maryland woman and repeatedly 
slashed her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The conundrum facing communities and law enforcement officers was illustrated 
by the release of Jerry (Animal) McFadden, a three-time convicted rapist, to 
the tiny East Texas hamlet of Hawkins in the fall of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The following May, McFadden murdered three of the town's teen-agers, raping one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
The town's sheriff, Frank White, says he protested McFadden's coming to Hawkins 
to the Texas Board of Parole and the Department of Corrections; but when 
McFadden arrived, White did not notify the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"After I hit the ceiling and bounced off the wall, I didn't do much," he says, 
adding that he feared stirring up unnecessary panic ("You can't hit the streets 
and say, 'Lock up your daughters. We've got a sex fiend on the loose,' " he 
maintains). He adds, "I didn't know where I stood legally as to further 
enhancing his (McFadden's) bad reputation." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the murders, however, Hawkins resident Janie Wilson led her 
community and the state in the formation of a victims' rights group, "We the 
People," which was responsible for the adoption last fall of a state 
constitutional amendment guaranteeing crime victims a more active role in the 
criminal justice process. Texas is one of five states, along with Washington, 
Rhode Island, Florida and Michigan, that have adopted constitutional amendments 
giving victims the right to be heard at parole hearings and sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
But, says Wilson, the loss to a community struck by heinous violence cannot be 
legally mended. "He stripped us of our innocence," she says of McFadden, now an 
inmate on death row. 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople lock their doors at night and when they have to drive over rural 
roads to the local shopping mall at night, they go in twos and threes, she 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
While communities feel threatened and helpless, it is often the victims who 
suffer the most anguish and outrage at the release of their assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Says Linda Barker-Lowrance, program director of the National Victim Center, an 
information and referral organization in Ft. Worth: "They feel vulnerable and 
helpless. First the perpetrator takes their control away. Then the police take 
it through their investigations. Finally the prosecutor has control." 
</P>
<P>
Some victims resort to drugs and alcohol to alleviate the pain, she says. They 
develop such eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia, and are subject to 
migraine headaches, depression, ulcers and heart attacks. A vast number of 
victims also have thoughts of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
For Marie Hafdahl, the symptoms have appeared as stomach disorders and chest 
pains. She attends stress control sessions with a psychologist, and, she says, 
she and David have taken self-defense classes. 
</P>
<P>
She is sure Rothenberg will try to contact her son. "He's obsessed with David. 
He views him as his possession. I don't think he'll let things be. They'll 
start eating away at him. It's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
But she says, as if coaching herself, "I cannot let my fear overtake me," and 
she adds with a rush, "I can't run away from this, even though I would like 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials and criminal experts point out that thousands of violent 
criminals are regularly released into public life without the public's 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Placement of parolees is typically known only to local law enforcement 
officials. Says California Department of Corrections spokesman, Tipton C. 
Kindel: "It's not something the public needs to know. We want to give 
ex-offenders a fair chance to reintegrate into society." Law enforcement 
officials are free to inform the public of a former criminal's whereabouts, 
and, concedes Kindel, "It may happen in this (Rothenberg) case, but we hope 
not." 
</P>
<P>
In extreme cases, when notorious criminals have been identified in communities, 
reaction has at times reached lynch mob hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
When Singleton was suspected of being in a motel in the Bay Area community of 
Concord, a crowd of several hundred gathered outside to protest. The town's 
police chief, George Straka, recalls that even people who had known him for 
years didn't believe him when he said Singleton was not inside. "They shut down 
rational thought," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff of Contra Costa County, Warren Rupf, similarly remembers how 
"everybody -- the public, the county officials, the politicians -- got 
hysterical" when Singleton was discovered living in an apartment house in the 
little township of Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
Even the police officers, who were called in to remove Singleton from the 
apartment house where an angry mob had gathered, felt a dual pull of emotions. 
"It was extremely frustrating," says Rupf, who brought Singleton to the safety 
of the sheriff's office. "Our officers were in a position of having to defend a 
person they felt deserved more severe punishment." When they brought him out of 
the apartment, Rupf says incredulously, "he was smiling." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, criminals say society cannot lock them out forever. It must 
give them a chance to change their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be crazy for a town to say, 'Oh, boy, are we glad to have you back.' 
They don't know if the person has changed or not,"' says Donald Weindorf, 55, 
who runs the Nebraska branch of the International Seventh Step Foundation, a 
Canada-based criminal counseling network, employing ex-offenders. 
</P>
<P>
However, says Weindorf, who served nine years for armed robbery in Illinois, 
"People look at offenders as animals. If you're going to hassle them all their 
lives, you might as well just kill 'em." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to reduce recidivism, say Weindorf and others who work with former 
prisoners, is through rehabilitation programs that work to change the attitudes 
of ex-offenders. According to Weindorf, in the last four years only two out of 
214 ex-cons who came through his program have been re-arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, says Weindorf, criminals experience street shock, stress, fear and 
ostracism after their release and, without help, are "a big screw-up. When they 
can't handle a situation they tend to fall back into old patterns." 
</P>
<P>
A former rapist and Seventh Step veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
points out the extent of alienation a criminal can typically experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a pretty sick guy," he says. "Crime was my cry for attention." During 
nine years in San Quentin, he says, "there were damn few times when I felt 
human." When he was freed, he states, "I had no more idea why I raped that 
woman." Each time the parole board would ask him, he says, "I'd go out and find 
the answers. I told them what they wanted to hear so they'd let me out." 
</P>
<P>
It is this type of image of criminal behavior that haunts Marie Hafdahl when 
she thinks of her former husband. Rothenberg has sent her a letter saying he 
would not harm her nor David and has spoken of helping other parents who commit 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But, Hafdahl says, "He's just trying to build up his image so people will 
loosen up. I know him. He's so mixed up, it's impossible for him to be 
rehabilitated." 
</P>
<P>
She says that, although he has refused interviews before his release, 
Rothenberg has agreed to appear on the "Oprah Winfrey" and "Larry King Live" 
shows; both programs have invited her to appear with him. She is appalled at 
their audacity ("Do they expect to have a family reunion?" she exclaims) and 
snickers dryly, "Charles loves publicity. He actually thinks he's going to be a 
TV celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
But, pondering the question no one can answer, she adds darkly, "I wonder what 
will happen when the publicity dies down."

<P>
Joe Montana has grown so tired of the question this week that he has managed to 
pare his answer down to 12, bite-sized syllables. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, what do you think when people say you're now the greatest quarterback of 
all time? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry about it," Montana said Monday. "Talk about it later." 
</P>
<P>
As for those missing pronouns, please stop by Montana's press podium Tuesday. 
Wednesday: compound sentences. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought he was efficient against the Rams. Montana has never been one 
for Super Bowl productions, unless you're talking about producing numbers and 
victories. He's 3-0 on the field, and looking for No. 4 this week in Super Bowl 
XXIV against Denver in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
Off the field, Montana offers only shutter-speed peeks at his personality. We 
know he's working on his third marriage. We know he is self-effacing, 
cleft-chinned, and during major media crushes, amazingly evasive and bland. 
</P>
<P>
Questions probing his all-time greatness and place in National Football League 
history are particularly disturbing to Montana who, for all his 
accomplishments, has spent much of an 11-year career searching for security and 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana? The greatest ever? Look closer. 
</P>
<P>
Between Super Bowl rings and superlatives, in fact, Montana has faced his share 
of crises. 
</P>
<P>
Before appearing in his first Super Bowl, remember, Montana was to some just a 
third-round draft choice from Notre Dame who might never have survived in the 
pros if not for the nurturing hand of a coach, Bill Walsh, who honed a frail 
but talented quarterback into a system in which he could not fail. 
</P>
<P>
Montana spent the season before his third world championship in 1988 fighting 
to keep his starting job. Does an all-time legend need these kinds of 
headaches? 
</P>
<P>
If Montana is the greatest quarterback ever, and the groundswell is mounting, 
why has he spent so much of his career protecting his backside and peering over 
his shoulder? 
</P>
<P>
It was only this season that Montana has finally felt comfortable as the 49er 
starter, he has confided. Walsh's retirement no doubt lifted a burden, and 
Montana at long last could tackle football's chicken-or-the-egg question: Did 
the system make the quarterback or the quarterback the system? 
</P>
<P>
Also, a noted quarterback controversy between he and Steve Young that Walsh 
kept burning, if only to provoke Montana to greater ends, was expunged. 
</P>
<P>
The team's new coach, George Seifert, announced before the first training-camp 
whistle that an injury-free Montana was a starting Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Montana responded with the greatest statistical season of his career -- of 
anyone's career -- although some longtime 49er watchers insist he has had 
better seasons, all things considered. 
</P>
<P>
Not for sheer numbers, anyway . . . Montana set the NFL single-season record 
for efficiency in 1989 with a rating of 112.4. So what's in a record? The mark 
he broke was held previously by Cleveland's Milt Plum, who has never been 
confused with greatness. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a fourth Super Bowl title this weekend would tie Montana with 
Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw for most titles for one quarterback. That fact, 
combined with his remarkable career efficiency and undeniable comeback 
qualities, might push Montana over the top. 
</P>
<P>
Eternal greatness, though, hasn't come easy. Montana has had one foot out the 
door for what has seemed like years. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young, who has a vested interest, calls him: THE QUARTERBACK WHO WOULDN'T 
DIE. 
</P>
<P>
Montana first leaned on the ropes back in 1986, when he injured his back in the 
opener against Tampa Bay. He sat out the second game against the Rams and hit 
the operating table the next Monday, Sept. 15. In surgery, Dr. Arthur White 
widened Montana's spinal canal and removed a ruptured disk. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said this week that White never suggested he retire from football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you're talking about," Montana told a reporter. "He didn't 
ask me to retire. No." 
</P>
<P>
Contacted Tuesday in San Francisco, however, White recalled vividly what he 
said when learning that Montana was going to attempt a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I said he was crazy," White said. "Although it was an off-the-cuff statement, 
modern medicine would say that after spinal surgery, people should not do 
contact sports. We do not release employees back to heavy labor after surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Montana returned to the lineup 55 days later, defying medical logic. White said 
he could have never imagined that Montana's best days might lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him two years at the most," White said. "I said 'If it blows, Joe, I 
can always fix it up good enough so you can play with the kids.' But to think 
he could still take those hits . . . It's amazing he could take the hits he 
does and not suffer more pain, and lasted this long. I'm elated, impressed, and 
really surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Not as surprised as a quarterback named Young and his agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Montana's surgery, Young's bright career was going nowhere in 
Tampa Bay. So, the plan was for Young to continue Montana's legacy in San 
Francisco. Looked good on paper. Steinberg, who lived in the Bay Area, had 
blue-lined Montana's medical reports and circled the words of Montana's own 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Young was traded to the 49ers four days before the 1987 draft. At the time, it 
seemed a perfect move. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors were saying that Montana should never play again," Steinberg 
recalled. "It appeared, for medical reasons, that Montana was approaching the 
end of his career. Obviously, he has had an amazing resurrection. The reports 
of his demise were greatly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, and now 28, Young is still waiting for Montana's retirement. 
With unique abilities of his own, Young has managed only to forge a competitive 
wedge between him and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's obviously outlasted my expectations, and maybe his own." Young said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
It's been the ultimate paradox for Young, who loves everything about San 
Francisco except who plays starting quarterback. How long can Young wait? 
Montana, 33, has a contract that runs through 1991 at $2.55 million per season. 
And he's talking about playing on. 
</P>
<P>
"For now it's OK," Young says, "Next week we need to talk about the future." 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, Young's lurking presence seems to have pushed Montana to some of his 
greater career moments. Not exactly what Young had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope someday he can look back on this and say, 'Boy, those were some great 
days," Young said. "Because we were always on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Young has left his mark, even from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
How many guys can make perhaps the greatest quarterback ever sweat out the best 
years of his career? 
</P>
<P>
Here's how many times after back surgery Montana has been presumed dead and 
buried: 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 NFC playoff game against the New York Giants, nose tackle Jim Burt 
knocked Montana unconscious in a 49-3 rout of the 49ers. There were doubts 
Montana would ever return. He did. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, after a season in which he led the 49ers to a 13-2 record and threw a 
career-high 31 touchdown passes, the 49ers were again bounced out in the first 
round, this time by the Minnesota Vikings. Montana was benched in favor of 
Young in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors of a Young succession in 1988 were fanned by none other than Walsh 
himself, who told reporters in training camp that the job was open for 
competition. Later, he blamed the media for igniting a controversy. Montana 
didn't know who started it, but said at the time: "I know Bill didn't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
If it was a ploy to light a fire, Montana was sufficiently stoked, although his 
career took a bleak but brief turn as the 49ers dropped to 6-5 at one point in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Young to the rescue? Not so fast. Montana recovered from an assortment of 
injuries to lead the 49ers into Super Bowl XXIII, where he engineered his 
famous last-minute, 89-yard, 10-play scoring drive to beat the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Young says it wouldn't be as frustrating playing behind a legend if he was a 
sturdier figure in the pocket. Knowing Montana might "blow" at any moment keeps 
Young's heart racing and, ultimately, dashes his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually harder," Young says. "I'm ready to play every week. He gets to 
get it out of his system. I pound myself in the head and he wonders what I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Young points out he's played more than a half in six games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Young can't help but respect Montana's tenacity. They list him at 6-feet-2 and 
195 pounds, but it's difficult to believe he's that tall or that heavy. Montana 
has always been injury prone, dating to his days at Notre Dame, when he was 
nagged by injuries and missed his junior season with a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's had two operations on his left knee, and one apiece on his right 
shoulder and right elbow. Then, there was that minor back realignment. During 
one stretch in 1987, he took cortisone injections in a chronically sore right 
elbow 11 consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Montana keeps coming back for more. Why? A love of the game, certainly. 
There's another pain-killer he takes called $2.55 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
Montana has suffered this season from various injuries to his ribs, elbow and 
knee. He has missed three games in 1989 and parts of others. 
</P>
<P>
Montana had his ribs injected with a pain-killer on numerous occasions this 
season, most notably before a Monday night game against the Rams on Dec. 11. He 
threw for a career-high 458 yards in the division-title clinching game and took 
the next week off. 
</P>
<P>
These injections aren't cholesterol-test pin-pricks, either. For sufficient 
numbing, doctors have to shoot Montana's ribs with a series of seven or eight 
injections. Sometimes he needs one more poke at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough," Young said. "You can't help ribs. The injections just take away 
the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Some people, noted back surgeons even, can't believe what Montana is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's functioning now with a back that you or I would not be able to play 
weekend tennis with," Dr. White said. "You'd have to give up tennis if you had 
his back." 
</P>
<P>
White wouldn't come right out and say that Montana will need more surgery when 
his playing days are over. But he came close. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much I can divulge," he said. "After each season he is 
evaluated. We repeat the scans. As one might expect, each season takes its 
toll. The likelihood of a second surgery is growing with every season and every 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
So you think Montana is ready to retire? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Montana says, "not yet." 
</P>
<P>
Besides standing, how does he want to be remembered? 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he's gone."
