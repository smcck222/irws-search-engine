STEPPED-UP DRUG WAR TO FOCUS ON S.D. BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH PLAN: QUESTIONS REMAIN AS TO HOW RESOURCES WILL BE ALLOCATED AMONG BORDER 
REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO AND TEXAS. 
</P>

<P>
For San Diego and the rest of the U.S.-Mexican border area, President's Bush's 
$10.6-billion anti-drug plan foresees the hiring of hundreds of new Customs 
officers and Border Patrol agents, the expansion of the U.S. immigration 
checkpoint near San Clemente, and the improvement of drug-detection 
capabilities at and between ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unknown, however, how the new resources will be allocated among the 
border regions of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas that make up a 
so-called "high-intensity drug trafficking" area that stretches for almost 
2,000 miles. The border is one of five such designated zones nationwide, along 
with Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego area, like other border regions, is a major conduit both for 
undocumented immigrants and for illicit drugs entering the United States from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the uncertainty of the much-ballyhooed anti-drug initiative is the 
fact that the Administration's proposals are subject to revision by Congress, 
which controls the government's purse strings. Whatever package emerges from 
Capitol Hill, results will be far from immediate: Only $25 million of the 
multibillion-dollar package is definitely scheduled to be used during the 
current fiscal year; most of the funds will be available in the fiscal year 
that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
According to the President's plan, border lawmakers and officials, the program 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
* The hiring of 175 new officers for the U.S. Customs Service to improve 
inspections at ports of entry, such as the giant facility at San Ysidro, which 
is billed as the world's busiest international crossing. In addition, the 
Administration plans to seek $5 million for 23 additional teams of 
drug-sniffing Customs dogs. The Administration is also attempting to modernize 
Customs equipment to help improve identification of false documents and 
suspected criminals. 
</P>
<P>
* The hiring of 174 new agents and 26 new support staff for the U.S. Border 
Patrol, the uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Border Patrol staffing has been declining since a 
hiring freeze was imposed in late 1988. The agents play a key role in deterring 
drug trafficking, particularly in the sometimes-vast areas between legal ports 
of entry. 
</P>
<P>
* The improvement and expansion of border-area fencing, ground sensors and 
other equipment, plus the completed expansion of the Border Patrol checkpoint 
along Interstate 5 near San Clemente. U.S. authorities have long sought a 
broadening and modernization of that facility, which is considered a key 
enforcement tool on the main route from the border to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The President's plan also envisions additional military assistance for border 
law enforcement, although few details were provided. The Administration would 
also like to increase by 1,000 slots the amount of detention space available 
for so-called "criminal aliens" -- foreigners convicted of drug-related and 
other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
All told, officials said, Bush's blueprint anticipates that perhaps 700 new 
federal officers will be assigned to the border region beginning late this 
year, including agents from Customs, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, among others. The border region would presumably receive some 
of the 75 new federal judgeships called for under the Bush plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under that plan, the border area and the four other target zones will get 
increased funding two ways: first, through a yet-undetermined split of the $25 
million that is to be distributed this year; that should be augmented with up 
to $21 million more from drug-related cash and other assets seized by federal 
authorities and plowed back into the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the vast majority of drug-fighting funds will be allocated through 
increases in the regular federal budget for law enforcement agencies, treatment 
programs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
In the second category, the Los Angeles area is expected to receive $169 
million in fiscal year 1991, 11% more than the current $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the nation's "high-intensity" areas have questioned whether a 
special $25-million fund to be shared this year would be sufficient to make 
much impact. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Bush outlined his plan, a group of police officers at one of Los 
Angeles' drug "supermarkets" wondered whether any of it would filter down to 
them. "Most of all, we need new radios," said Sgt. Dave Cullen, part of a Los 
Angeles police narcotics crew making one of its periodic sweeps through 
MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although few details were given of the benefits that target areas can expect, 
officials said 300 additional agents and support personnel will likely be added 
to Los Angeles offices of federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement 
Administration and Customs Service.

ENCINITAS INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO DRIVE MIGRANTS FROM CITY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
After rising pressures from local business operators, Encinitas has 
dramatically stepped up its efforts to close a migrant encampment on a small 
tract of city-owned land by increasing its "clean-up" of the area from 
twice-monthly to daily, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision made Tuesday by the Encinitas Sanitary District, which owns the 
18-acre parcel of eucalyptus, bamboo and thick brush behind the Big Bear Market 
on Encinitas Boulevard, a city- hired crew has become an almost constant 
presence on the property -- waging daily, four-hour clean-up patrols that began 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Target Services of Vista was hired by the city last year to visit the camp 
twice a month, not only to haul away trash and clean up feces, but also to 
dismantle makeshift shanties and hooches erected by the 100 or so Guatemalans 
who live there. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to step up the patrols, Sanitary Board members said, came after 
repeated complaints from area businessmen that the migrants were not only 
causing a nuisance and driving away revenue but had threatened several 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The newest cleanup efforts are part of a "three-pronged approach" to finally 
rid the area of the migrant camps, said Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines, who has 
been outspoken on the migrant laborer issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitary District, made up of the city's five council members, is also 
seeking permission from the Coastal Commission and state Department of Fish and 
Game to "de-vegetate" or strip away the gnarly brush in which the migrants 
conceal their homes, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, if the daily cleanup efforts fail, the district's board will 
consider hiring a security firm employing no-nonsense methods such as armed 
patrolmen and round-the-clock helicopter patrols to spread the message that the 
migrant camp will no longer be tolerated in the heavily commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have our choice of armed or unarmed guards, or a firm that employs 
surprise, nighttime raids," Gaines said. "We'll have lots of options. But, 
whatever we decide, we want it to have the maximum effect." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most critical step being considered by the City Council is an 
ordinance to bar any residents -- including migrant laborers -- from loitering 
or seeking day labor on city streets, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Official talk of the ordinance could come as early as next month when the 
council will be host to a special meeting to hear public testimony on the 
migrant issue, which officials fear has begun to divide the town along distinct 
battle lines. 
</P>
<P>
A city official who asked not to be identified said the council is prepared to 
pass the ordinance -- similar to ones that have been attacked on constitutional 
grounds and are the target of ACLU lawsuits in at least two cities in the Los 
Angeles area -- and ask the San Diego County Sheriff's Department to enforce it 
until otherwise ordered. 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan camp issue has become a major test for this North County coastal 
city in its efforts to control the influx of migrant laborers from Mexico and 
Central America, whose hastily constructed camps stand in stark contrast to -- 
and often within several hundred feet of -- upscale housing tracts and 
condominium complexes, city officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried gentler measures, such as the hiring hall. We've done all we 
said we were going to do in regard to this issue during the first year," Gaines 
said. "But overall, it hasn't worked. It hasn't solved the problem. Business 
people have suffered. They've lost money. The action we take now has to be 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tuesday's decision, officials say, sends a message that the city 
indeed means business in shutting camps that are believed to be causing a 
nuisance or violating health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
"The crews are going to step up their efforts to not only pick up trash but 
also tear down hooches, fill spider holes and remove personal belongings they 
find in their way," said Mort August, director of public works for the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said signs in Spanish and English have been posted informing migrants that 
their personal possessions are subject to seizure. Migrant advocates have 
questioned that precaution, however, saying that many of the Guatemalan 
residents of the camp speak only faltering Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Very simply, we're going to let them know they're not wanted on the property," 
August said, "and that, if they're insistent on being out there, we're going to 
be out there on a regular basis, too." 
</P>
<P>
North County migrant advocates have called the city's newest cleanup efforts 
"Gestapo tactics." 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible. It's like having the Gestapo going in, treating people like 
that," said the Rev. Rafael Martinez, executive director of the North County 
Chaplaincy in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"There might be certain incidents of mischief now and then by certain 
individuals, but you can't treat everyone the same way because of a few. That's 
like the Latino people saying that, because of a few alleged incidents of 
racism by two Anglo store owners in Carlsbad, that all Anglos are racist. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go after the group, you go after the individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said his group and other migrant-advocacy organizations will be 
prepared to take the battle to court if the city passes an ordinance making it 
illegal for migrants to solicit work on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a dark day in Encinitas if that became law," he said. "And it 
would be challenged, attorneys would look into it. It sounds like the same 
harassment of these migrant people that Encinitas has become notorious for. 
</P>
<P>
"It just discredits the City Council when it loses its head just because 
powerful people come and complain." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Bell, executive vice president for the Wendy's Restaurant chain in San 
Diego, said the migrants pose a growing threat to businesses and their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are drunk, and they have used the areas as a hangout," he said. 
"They've taken showers in the bathroom of our restaurant and have wandered 
through the dining room picking up food from people's plates when they step 
away from their tables." 
</P>
<P>
The migrants have also broken outdoor sprinkler heads on the premises for 
showers, causing more than $60,000 in damage and maintenance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to open at 6 a.m. and do a good breakfast business. But because of the 
migrant presence, we don't open till 10 each day," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said local business owners met two weeks ago at the Wendy's after a woman 
was reportedly assaulted outside a coin laundry. He said they presented to 
sanitary district board members a petition bearing the names of 450 area 
customers who would want an ordinance enforced to stop the loitering. 
</P>
<P>
"My store manager out there sees this every day, and he'd just as soon send the 
bombers in to take care of that camp," Bell said. "What you're seeing from 
business owners is that their patience is wearing pretty thin." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the city gears up for its most stringent, get-tough migrant policy yet, 
some officials are advising caution. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Omsted, a City Council and sanitary district board member, said the 
long-range plans "have not been thought out that carefully" and said she has 
brought up those concerns with other board members. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked the question, 'What are we really doing here?' " she said. "The 
desire is to get these people to leave Encinitas or at least Sanitary District 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if they can't stay on public land, then aren't we forcing them into 
private property? And shouldn't we consider all the implications before we move 
these people out?" 
</P>
<P>
Omsted said that, in a past Sanitary District meeting, she and staff members 
have suggested that portable toilets be provided on the lot to cut down on the 
large amount of human feces found there. 
</P>
<P>
"But the message from other board members was delivered loud and clear that 
putting the toilets on the property was like saying it was OK for these people 
to be there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's not OK for them to be there. But they're still there. At least for 
now."

RACIAL BRAWL AT EL CAJON JAIL LEAVES 12 HURT; 
</P>
<P>
RIOT: FIGHT BETWEEN BLACKS, LATINOS SPREAD THROUGHOUT CELLBLOCK HOUSING 100 
INMATES IN SPACE BUILT FOR 24. 
</P>

Twelve inmates were injured, three of them with serious stab wounds, in what 
was described as a race riot Thursday at the County Jail in El Cajon, the site 
of numerous riots, fights and jail breaks in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the injured inmates, identified as Jose Flores, 29, was in critical 
condition late Thursday night at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the fight began about 4:34 p.m. in Cellblock 7A on the seventh 
floor when a Latino and a black inmate began fighting shortly after dinner. The 
area was designed with 24 individual cells, but housed 100 inmates on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ben McLaughlin, supervisor of the jail, said that, as soon as the 
cellblock fight broke out, "the next thing we knew, everybody had jumped in." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five to 30 inmates joined the melee, which McLaughlin said was divided 
along racial lines. The fight lasted about 15 minutes until five deputies in 
riot gear and wielding a Taser gun and a pellet gun entered the area and 
quieted the disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get in there as fast as we can, but we have to follow certain 
procedures for our own safety," the captain said. 
</P>
<P>
He said deputies did not use the weapons against the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is show it to them and they'll back off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates returned to their cells and the entire jail was placed in a 
lockdown status. 
</P>
<P>
The three serious injuries included one inmate stabbed in the chest, one 
stabbed in the eye and head area, and a third who suffered stab wounds to a 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear what type of weapons were used, but McLaughlin said inmates "can 
make weapons out of just about anything," such as broken broom handles and 
cabinet tops. "There's quite a bit of material in this jail that can be used 
for weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmate with the chest injury was flown by helicopter to Sharp Memorial 
Hospital, while the other 11 inmates were taken by ambulance to various nearby 
medical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin listed the 12 injured inmates as: Miguel Carrano, Augustine Estrada, 
Jose Flores, David Gonzales, Marscal Gonzalez, Jose Lopez, Thomas Navarro, 
Ricardo Perez, Ernesto Reyna, Antonio Sandoval, Christopher Wagner and David 
Wright. The Sheriff's Department did not provide their ages, hometowns, degree 
of injury or where they were taken for medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies used a helicopter to search for any possible jail escapees, 
and moved in special sheriff's vans ready to take inmates out if the tensions 
continued to accelerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon jail has been plagued with riots, inmate abuse and overcrowding, 
and 10 prisoners have escaped since the nine-story building opened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when allegations surfaced publicly about deputy sheriffs beating 
inmates, a group of deputies at the El Cajon jail were nicknamed the Rambo 
Squad for their abuse of inmates. The county Grand Jury later confirmed that 
inmates were improperly treated, and six deputies and their supervisors were 
disciplined.

BLACKS DETAIL PLAN FOR CLASSROOM SUCCESS, CRITICIZE SYSTEM AS RACIST; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: COALITION SPOKESWOMAN THREATENS "TEACHER BASHING" IF 1980S' ATTITUDE 
CONTINUES TO PREVAIL IN SAN DIEGO DISTRICT.

<P>
Frustrated by the lack of academic success among black students, a coalition of 
San Diego-area black organizations Thursday simultaneously unveiled a detailed 
plan for schools, parents and students to boost achievement and lashed out at 
the school system for "miseducation and institutionalized racism" against 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Initial favorable reaction of city schools administrators and teachers to many 
of the recommendations in the 58-page "Blueprint For Action" was tempered by 
the language of coalition spokeswoman Jacqueline Jackson, director of education 
for the Urban League of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson told a briefing of black leaders and district educators that blacks 
would resort to "teacher bashing" in the 1990s, if necessary, to counter what 
she called the daily bashing of black children during the 1980s that blacks 
allowed to happen because they were too passive toward public schooling. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the black community "would no longer tolerate" racist teachers or 
explanations that lay all or part of the blame for poor academics on a lack of 
parent involvement, gang problems, excess television or other factors outside 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
She said the coalition soon would demand that the San Diego Unified School 
District hire an advocate for black parents and students. The advocate would 
report not to the district but to one or more of the nonprofit organizations 
under the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"This will not be the last of us," Jackson warned schools at the conclusion of 
the coalition's presentation Thursday. Asked later whether there was anything 
positive happening in the schools, Jackson said there "must be" since, in her 
view, about 8% of black students are doing well in San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
No school official saw the blueprint before Thursday's presentation. Deputy 
Schools Supt. Bertha Pendleton said afterward that, although the district "must 
generate support to improve (black academics) among both its people and the 
community," the statements by Jackson "will not make things any easier." 
</P>
<P>
Secondary teacher Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego Teachers Assn., called 
the remarks "intemperate," saying that the problem "is bigger than just saying 
that everything is the schools' fault. 
</P>
<P>
"At first glance, I think the document has a lot of things that are positive. . 
. . We haven't been successful with a lot of things we've tried. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're going to have to deal with things now both in terms of the report 
and in what Jackson said." 
</P>
<P>
Even school board Vice President Shirley Weber, herself a strong critic during 
the past year of school programs to help black students achieve, later 
distanced herself somewhat from Jackson's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some good things happening in schools but not on a consistent 
basis," Weber said. "There are teachers and administrators working hard, but 
you can't say with any level of certainty to (blacks) that you can put your kid 
in any school and the system will provide a good level of education." 
</P>
<P>
Weber said that Jackson's statements represent "an adequate perception" of how 
the black community sees schools treating black children. "I'd say that too 
many children are poorly educated, not miseducated . . . but the effect is the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
The blueprint presented Thursday results from black community concern over 
statistics, both local and nationwide during the past year, showing that blacks 
continue to do poorly in school overall and that achievement gaps separating 
black from white and Asian students are widening. 
</P>
<P>
Black students in San Diego number about 19,000, about 16% of the district's 
119,000 student total. 
</P>
<P>
Several district studies have shown that black students rank near or at the 
bottom on standardized achievement tests and grade-point averages, and near or 
at the top in dropout rates, suspensions and placement in special-education 
classes. In 1987-88, only 23 of 444 black male seniors graduating from city 
schools had grade-point averages of 3.0 or above out of a maximum of 4.0. 
One-third of black students drop out of high school, contrasted with one out of 
four overall in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's plan includes specific items for the school district in 
general, for teachers and counselors, for students and parents, and for 
business and community leaders. Many recommendations involve ideas that the 
district, or individual schools, already use or have agreed to try. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations: that schools actively recruit black teachers and 
role models; work with teachers to lessen racism and raise their expectations 
for black children; expand parent education classes at schools; put more 
aspects of black culture and history into the curriculum; have students 
approach school more positively by working on study habits; and ask parents to 
reward class success. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson and other coalition members returned several times in their 
statements to demands that district employees stop their "alienation of 
blacks," in the words of Gail Knight, head of the San Diego chapter of the 
National Black Child Development Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"If what is happening to black students was happening to white children, it 
would have been stopped," Jackson said, referring to what she said are the many 
complaints from parents to the Urban League about schools telling them "how 
wrong" the parents are to complain and "how bad their child is" in behavior.

PENTAGON CUTS LIKELY TO SKIP S.D. BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

San Diego will not be dramatically affected by the Pentagon budget cuts 
scheduled to be announced Monday, a high-ranking local Navy official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"When the American people demand that you spend less on military, you are going 
to have to shut something down, and San Diego is too big to shut down," said 
Rear Adm. John W. Adams, commander of San Diego Naval Base. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will announce the Pentagon's 1991 fiscal 
blueprint, which will include base closings, Monday, said Navy spokesman Lt. 
Greg Smith in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, however, will escape many of the cuts, Adams predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are base closures, it is my personal opinion that San Diego will not 
be among them and could possibly benefit, because, if you close home ports, 
ships will have to go somewhere, and San Diego is a pretty logical place for 
them to come," Adams said after an address to the San Diego Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
Other military experts agreed that the number of ships based in San Diego could 
increase under the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a chance that San Diego and Norfolk could even see increases in 
manpower and numbers of ships, simply because, if we pull ships out of small, 
scattered ports, we may bring them to large, efficiently run harbors," said Ron 
Fraser, a retired Navy commander and senior analyst with the Center for Defense 
Information in Washington. San Diego and Norfolk, Va., are two of the Navy's 
major installations. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is expected to shrink the Pentagon budget, after 
accounting for inflation, by at least 2% a year for the next five years. Since 
1985, the Pentagon's Pentagon budget has decreased by 2% a year, after 
accounting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
And traditionally, more than half the budget has been devoted to protecting 
Western Europe. But some lawmakers, pointing to dramatic changes in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union, say the United States faces fewer threats and have 
called for larger cuts in defense spending. It is not yet known how those cuts 
will affect the Navy, Army and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
But Fraser and others expect that the Navy will not be hit nearly as hard as 
the Army and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect Congress to be easy on the Navy because, during peacetime, the 
Navy has far greater utility than the Army and Air Force. You can steam ships 
around the seas with far greater freedom than you can fly airplanes or station 
troops," Fraser said. "The Air Force and Army will get winnowed back a lot 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy now spends more than $9 billion annually in San Diego, from Defense 
Department contracts to payroll, local officials say. In fact, payroll -- $4.4 
billion yearly -- makes up about half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, which is host to about one-third of all Navy employees, there are 
about 175,000 Navy civilian and military personnel. Of those, 100,000 are 
sailors, 40,000 are Marines and the rest are civilians. This figure, Adams 
predicted, is not likely to change dramatically -- even if more ships are based 
in San Diego.

JUDGE'S RETIREMENT OPENS SUPERIOR COURT SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: ROSS G. THARP SAYS HE WON'T BE SEEKING REELECTION. SAN DIEGO MUNICIPAL 
COURT JUDGE FREDERIC L. LINK ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN FOR THE POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Ross G. Tharp will not run for reelection, 
opening a spot on the bench that San Diego Municipal Court Judge Frederic L. 
Link will run for, both judges confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp, 61, said he delivered a letter Thursday to Judge Judith McConnell, the 
San Diego Superior Court's presiding judge, announcing that he will retire to 
write and travel "before heading for that big courthouse in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Eligible for retirement in late July after 20 years on the bench, Tharp's 
decision not to file for reelection means there could be a contested campaign 
for his seat on the 71-member court. Link, 46, a criminal law specialist with 
nearly nine years on the bench, said he offers the community a "known 
commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Because a backlog of criminal cases frequently plagues Superior Court, selected 
Municipal Court judges routinely are allowed to sit as Superior Court judges at 
the downtown San Diego courthouse, and Link said he has "handled thousands of 
felony cases" as well as three murder jury trials since taking the bench in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people running for the bench are not judges, and you don't know what 
their record is," Link said. "I have something they can look at." 
</P>
<P>
The developments Thursday marked the informal opening of campaign season for 
the 31 spots on the Superior Court bench up for confirmation. McConnell, the 
presiding judge, said she understands that the 30 other incumbents are all 
planning to file for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the county's registrar of voters begins accepting formal papers from 
incumbent judges or challengers announcing an intent to run. The filing 
deadline is Feb. 7, said Barbara Walther, a senior clerk at the registrar's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period is the same for the county's Municipal Court, where 24 spots 
will be up this year for confirmation, Walther said. Of the 24 seats, 10 are at 
the San Diego court, six at Vista, four at El Cajon and four at Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Municipal Court is administratively split into four districts, 
unlike the Superior Court, which takes in the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp's decision not to pursue reelection makes him the second judge within a 
month to announce a departure from the San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Louis E. Boyle, however, who left the bench at the end of December to 
return to the district attorney's office in a move prompted largely by the 
shortage of courtrooms and physical shortcomings at the downtown San Diego 
courthouse, Tharp said he will miss being a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego court, Tharp said, is the "finest in the state, if not the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Tharp said he does not plan to immediately endorse Link for his spot because he 
wants "to see who else is in the race before making a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
"I have only the greatest respect for (Link), but I'm not sure if a retiring 
judge, or any retiring officer, can exert any pressure on the electorate," 
Tharp said. "And, besides, I don't know if that's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Link said he hopes to receive "significant backing" from police groups, lawyers 
and judges. Late Thursday, Link said, he was endorsed by the San Diego Police 
Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to continue to seek ways to improve the system for the citizens, 
witnesses and victims who come into the courthouse," Link said. "The old ways 
cannot be followed any longer. We must find and seek out innovative solutions 
to the problems that the citizens demand be solved." 
</P>
<P>
Link was appointed to the Municipal Court in June, 1981, elected to his post in 
1982 and reelected in 1988. He served as the court's presiding judge in 1985 
and 1986 and has a lengthy record of involvement in bench, bar and community 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking the bench, Link was a deputy district attorney and a San Diego 
lawyer specializing in criminal defense. He attended college at UC Santa 
Barbara and law school at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp served two years on the San Diego Municipal Court, from 1969 to 1971, 
before then-Gov. Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Superior Court. He was 
elected in 1972 and reelected in 1978 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp, a Republican, ran for the state Assembly's 78th District seat in 1980 
but lost to incumbent Lawrence Kapiloff -- who, like Tharp, is now a San Diego 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
From 1957 to 1961, Tharp served on the San Diego City Council. In private 
practice for 14 years before moving to the bench in 1969, he went to college 
and law school at Loyola University in Los Angeles.

ESCONDIDO TAKES REINS OF RECYCLING WITH TRASH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until recently, Escondido residents could take their recyclable trash to the 
Noon Optimist Club salvage center, earn a little pin money and know their 
efforts were aiding local youth projects. But the center closed. 
</P>
<P>
In the near future, those same householders will be putting their salable trash 
at the curb and paying the city to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
It is the way of the future in this era of garbage glut, said Mike Little, the 
Escondido city staffer in charge of turning the proposed citywide recycling 
plan into reality. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who hopes to have the voluntary recycling program operating by May, 
believes that such programs soon will become mandatory as local governments 
scramble to meet new state standards that require that 25% of all trash be 
recycled by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's plan has been about a year in the making, Little said, and has 
borrowed ideas from other California communities already in the recycling 
business: bright-colored containers for residents' recycled trash, modest 
per-household fees to cover the collection costs and educational programs 
appealing to the residents' environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Noon Optimist Club's center closed after 18 years because of a 
combination of management problems and falling prices for recyclable items, 
other centers remain open. Residents can still sell their trash to one of 
these, but it does not absolve them from paying the city fee. 
</P>
<P>
County solid waste management officials emphasize the growing trash problem by 
citing statistics that show that per capita trash volume has grown 40% in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch was made official when Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law last 
fall a bill that mandates 25% recycling by all local governments by 1995 and 
50% recycling by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke Nash, who heads Solana Recyclers, is a veteran in the recycling business 
and converted Solana Beach (1983) and Del Mar (l987) into two of the first 100% 
recycling cities in the county where commercial, industrial and residential 
properties all participate on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas is going to full recycling in a few months, and other cities, 
including Carlsbad, San Marcos and La Mesa, are gearing up for citywide 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido, which has had a pilot program of about 500 homes operating since 
last May, plans to phase in its citywide residential program in May. About 
7,500 of the city's 22,100 single-family homes will be served in the first 
phase, followed by a midsummer expansion and total coverage in November. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido City Council members gave the program a vote of approval after a 
workshop Wednesday night but requested that the city staff work out a few kinks 
in the system and investigate a "carrot and stick" approach to reward 
participants in the curbside recycling program and penalize bleacher sitters. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said that no such system has been tried in coastal cities because of the 
difficulty in keeping records and the unfairness of penalizing persons who take 
their recyclable trash to salvage centers. 
</P>
<P>
She said curbside recycling programs alone will not meet the 1995 requirement 
for recycling 25% of the trash generated within a city. Grass clippings and 
other organic wastes, which make up 20%-30% of all solid waste -- must be 
recycled into mulch and ground cover before such recycling levels can be met. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are considering banning the dumping of greenery in landfills, 
requiring instead that it be separated and dumped at chipping centers situated 
at landfills, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the curbside recycling program proposed for Escondido, residents would 
pay $1.37 a month, picking up some city administrative costs and most 
collection costs. 
</P>
<P>
The city would face start-up costs of about $380,000 to acquire recycling 
containers and to set up the program. Escondido Disposal Inc., which handles 
trash pickup in the city, would face an equal amount of start-up costs, 
including acquisition of new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Little estimated that the recycled materials would bring in $15,000 to $50,000 
a year in city revenue, which could be applied toward the cost of the program.

JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The verdict is in. Not only was Peggy McMartin Buckey found innocent, but the 
other five female teachers who were originally prosecuted were dismissed 
because of "incredibly weak evidence." 
</P>
<P>
These innocent defendants have suffered greatly because of this modern-day 
witch hunt. It is fortunate that our legal system prevented their unjust 
conviction in view of the tremendous adverse publicity generated by the media. 
</P>
<P>
I think that it is both just and reasonable that the City of Manhattan Beach 
and County of Los Angeles consider appropriating a substantial sum of money to 
compensate these defendants for their huge financial losses. They can never be 
compensated for the suffering which they have had to endure due to their 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
As to Ray Buckey, a cloud of doubt still hangs over his head, but he has 
already suffered five years of jail and has not been convicted of any crime. 
The remaining charges against him should be promptly dismissed.

PUTTING A PREMIUM ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration is making good on his commitment of 
Jan. 9 to draft legislation "which addresses the health care needs of the 
uninsured." His staff is now circulating a draft plan that holds real promise, 
although it may fall short of his own goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted by the Health and Welfare Agency, the plan has yet to be endorsed by 
Deukmejian, but it clearly will expedite the work of a task force that he and 
the Legislature created last year to develop a health plan by March. 
</P>
<P>
Three fundamental problems still require careful study: funding, mandates and 
cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
Still short on details, the new plan appears to rely on a mixture of premiums, 
to be paid by both workers and employers, tax incentives and subsidies, with an 
expanded Medi-Cal program as backup. Reliance on Medi-Cal could be a problem; 
the system is already over-used and under-funded. The report suggests a 15% 
increase in reimbursement rates paid to doctors, but that would not begin to 
correct the underpayments that have kept doctors and dentists from providing 
services and have driven hospitals out of Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
In place of a mandate for universal insurance for all workers, the draft gives 
employers who don't provide insurance the option of paying health-care expenses 
of their workers and their dependents directly. That may be as good a way as 
any to implement universal coverage for the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Cost containment features of the plan do not yet appear fully developed. This 
is a sensitive issue with doctors and hospitals, who generally resist 
constraints on their discretion, but employers and insurance companies are 
right in making cost controls an essential element of any plan. Fortunately for 
the task force, there is a growing body of research demonstrating effective 
ways to control costs. But medical inflation figures show how little has been 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, all health-insurance payments beyond those covering basic 
benefits would be taxable and health-insurance premiums would no longer be 
fully deductible as a business expense. Alain Enthoven, a leading health-care 
economist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has long proposed this 
latter reform to discourage excessive coverage that can drive up medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the plan is not calculated as yet. The range of premiums dramatizes 
the disparities in coverage implicit in the plan, with monthly costs ranging 
from $85 for Medi-Cal coverage to $128 for private fee-for-service coverage. 
Premium subsidies for low-income employees and tax credits for their employers 
would add to the cost to the state. There probably would be an overall saving, 
however, as broader insurance coverage resulted in better prevention and 
primary health care, reducing the high costs associated with postponement of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
As now written, the draft appears to fall short in two ways. It does not cover 
all 5 million uninsured Californians, leaving as many as 1 million exposed. And 
its provisions seem least effective for those most in need, imposing costs that 
the working poor may find impossible to pay and limiting benefits in ways that 
may still leave the health-care system with uncompensated care. 
</P>
<P>
But there is time to work those problems out, and the task force has talent 
enough for the job.

JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staff writer David Shaw's indictment of the media coverage of the McMartin case 
is a masterpiece of journalistic analysis and should be nominated for a prize 
(Part A, Jan. 19-22). 
</P>
<P>
If ever television and newspaper reporters have had a better reason to hang 
their heads in shame, I haven't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
The press' amplification of Deputy Dist. Atty. Eleanor Barrett's claim that 
"millions" of kiddie porn photos had been taken, and its subsequent failure to 
follow up the fact that, despite an exhaustive search, not a single picture was 
ever found, is just one of many examples of unforgivable media negligence. This 
example also reveals another fact of journalistic life. Claiming that such 
photos exist is headline-grabbing; discovering that they don't is boring, even 
disappointing. And it's headlines that sell newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the jury in a criminal trial must base its decision exclusively on 
the validity of evidence presented in court, not on media sensationalism. 
Unfortunately, the public forms its opinion exclusively from that media 
coverage. The widespread outrage over the acquittal of Ray Buckey and his 
mother is a vivid reminder of the enormous power of the press to shape public 
opinion. It is also a sobering reminder of the media's responsibility to report 
accurately and fairly.

Having observed the McMartin fiasco unfold firsthand and being familiar with 
many of the parents, doctors and therapists in the case, I would like to add my 
criticism to the retrospective you have been doing on the media's coverage of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, one of the greatest problems with the media was their tunnel 
vision after the case went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in their myopia was the fact that hundreds of children who did not choose 
to testify (many with definitive medical signs of sexual abuse) ultimately 
disclosed/alleged they were abused at the preschool. 
</P>
<P>
Because reporters focused almost entirely on the prosecution witnesses and the 
therapists at the Children's Institute International (CII), the broader context 
of the story was lost. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it was not widely reported nor was it often reiterated that many 
children who alleged abuse at the preschool did so to doctors and therapists 
(some outside the state) with no connection whatsoever to CII. This, I would 
think, was and is a very important part of a story where the "inexperienced and 
poorly trained" therapists at CII are now being blamed for botching the case or 
somehow conspiring to "program" the children they interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, in this and a number of other instances The Times and most other 
media covering the story were "out chasing rabbits while the elephants got 
away." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if you would be doing so much hand-wringing if they had been found 
guilty?

Let us hope that the most important lesson to be learned from the McMartin 
trial is taken to heart: The legal system relies far too much on the supposed 
"expertise" of mental health "professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Psychology is about as scientific as voodoo, and those who practice it have a 
vested interest in identifying a psychological problem where none is present, 
as only by doing this is their existence justified. 
</P>
<P>
It is good that the jury saw that the children's testimony was the product of 
suggestion, not reality. Unfortunately, not all juries or judges are so wise.

In her column "Do Children Lie? Not About This" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 19), Carol 
Travis begins with: "It comes down to this: the McMartin jury did not believe 
the children." 
</P>
<P>
I disagree. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the jury realized the case was being rushed through by vigilantes, 
and asked themselves -- Why? Is something amiss? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone watching the press interview of the jury after the trial should feel a 
great relief that such an unbiased jury was there to sort through the mess. I 
thank each of them for their candor and attention to the law. We should all 
thank them -- who knows when we might need such a faithful group?

Now that jury has finally rendered a verdict, it is clear that jurors found the 
whole thing to be a debacle. 
</P>
<P>
This case was mishandled by the police, the so-called child abuse "experts" 
and, above all, by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. Do we dare elect the principal 
architect of this debacle to be the chief law enforcement officer of 
California? I say no. 
</P>
<P>
I further believe that the remaining counts should be dismissed forthwith so 
that the children (who were almost certainly molested) can rebuild their lives 
and to give the beleaguered taxpayers who paid the bill for this fiasco a 
well-deserved rest.

<P>
And now we continue "General Outpatient," the ongoing weekly saga of two 
average Americans fighting the battle against the bulge of medical mis- and 
dis-information. 
</P>
<P>
As devoted viewers of this show may recall, we first met Dick and Jane when 
they still believed that Food is Love. Indeed, Dick had courted Jane (he 
blushes to think about it now) with a box of chocolates. The butterfat content 
alone would turn his token of affection into a lethal weapon. But who knew 
then? 
</P>
<P>
After much time and many episodes, our friends joined the legions who abide and 
try-not-to-die by the motto, Food is Medicine. These days, they take their 
medicine -- low-sodium and hold the butter. In the salad days of their lives, 
they have learned to use olive and eschew palm. They just-say-no to eggs and 
yes to potatoes, which they call potassium, as in: "Baked potassium for supper, 
dear?" 
</P>
<P>
This transition was not as easy as it may seem to those of you who watch them 
graze through dinner. At times, Jane notices that her diet resembles the meals 
her grandmother had fled the Old Country to avoid. Dick wonders aloud whether 
he was destined to live longer and enjoy it less. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, even a self-consciously healthy marriage such as theirs had its rough 
spots, which fans surely recall. As passionate followers of medical research, 
they have had their arguments. There came the time when she wanted to cut down 
on cocktails because of a link found between booze and breast cancer. He, on 
the other hand, wanted to hoist a few because it was writ that it lowered 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
But these were the sort of family arguments that disrupt most homes in this 
you-are-what-you-eat era -- arguments that have replaced disputes over religion 
and politics -- as we sit around the kitchen table reading ingredients to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, Dick and Jane had found areas of happy communality in 
"General Outpatient." The past year had been the best of times when oat-bran 
obsession had become something of a mid-life hobby. 
</P>
<P>
This was a period of intense togetherness, not to mention aloneness, since oat 
bran had certain digestive side effects that made Dick and Jane less than 
welcome guests -- something our viewers wouldn't have known. 
</P>
<P>
But now, we tune in one week after Dick and Jane received the news that oat 
bran is not the miracle cure for cholesterol, that its value was in taking up 
stomach room normally occupied by sausages and Brie. That the oat-bran mania 
was madness! 
</P>
<P>
Our couple seem as disconsolate as former followers of Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
Can this marriage be saved? What has held them together, this all-American 
couple, except a devotion to their innard needs? And a deep belief that finally 
they would find the way to perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
But wait a minute, the camera pans in on Jane as she notices new medical 
research in the news. Researchers say that older couples who drink coffee 
appear to be more sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
Tune in next week, when "General Outpatient" goes X-rated.

Two women in separate cars died in a head-on collision Wednesday afternoon on 
Interstate 15, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
LaVerne Stella Rhea, 64, was driving south at 4:35 p.m. on I-15, one-quarter 
mile south of Pala Road, when her left front tire blew out. She lost control of 
her car, which crossed the center divider into the northbound lanes, hitting 
60-year-old Rose Fraticelli Dehaven's car head-on.

WITH WINGS AND A PRAYER, FAMILY'S LIFESAVING DREAM COMES TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gwendolyn Johnson always dreamed of coming to California, but she never 
expected she would have to make the trip to save her daughter's life. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-year-old Deborah Johnson didn't know it, but she had blood clots in 
her lungs. She could barely walk a short distance because of breathing 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
For five months, Chicago doctors told her she had pneumonia. Finally, last 
November, Dr. Robert Cohen, a pulmonary specialist in Cook County discovered 
she had chronic pulmonary emboli, or blood clots in the lung's arteries. 
</P>
<P>
"The blood clots were causing the blood flow to be obstructed, which would have 
caused her to die within a year of heart failure, " Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Chicago had no physician who could perform the surgery. Cohen 
and the Johnsons chose Dr. Pat Daily in San Diego because he pioneered the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The specialized operation is performed in only a few places in the United 
States, and the best hospital for it is Sharp Memorial in San Diego, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwendolyn Johnson, who works as a lunch room attendant at a Chicago high 
school, could not afford to send her daughter to California on her salary. 
Cohen and his staff contacted two organizations and received $2,700 in 
donations for the trip. Insurance will pay the medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons flew to San Diego Jan. 8, the first airplane ride for both mother 
and daughter. They left for home early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed of coming to California," said Gwendolyn Johnson, a single 
mother of three, "but I didn't dream I would come this way." 
</P>
<P>
A chapter of the Starlight Foundation helped make the trip possible. Cohen 
called the foundation, an international organization that grants wishes to 
chronically, critically and terminally ill patients from the ages of 2 1/2 to 
18. 
</P>
<P>
The group paid for the Johnsons' travel expenses, food and hotel, and added 
spending money for a total of $1,700. The Cook County Hospital auxiliary gave 
the family another $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Daily, director of cardiovascular surgery at Sharp, Deborah's 
surgery, which took place Jan. 12, is rare, mainly because the clots usually 
clear up on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984, there were only 85 of these operations that were reportedly done in 
the world," Daily said. "There have been 175 performed in San Diego so far, but 
it is hard to tell how many have been done worldwide today." 
</P>
<P>
The operation went smoothly, he said, and took about five hours. Deborah can 
expect to be "doing what she wants" in six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great, but I was scared during the operation," the 12th-grader said. "I 
thought I was going to wake up during the operation. I thought I wasn't going 
to make it. They told me it would take about 10 to 12 hours." 
</P>
<P>
"It was rough," her mother said. "But we made it through by prayer and reading 
the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad everything is over with," she said. "I can get my life going again. I 
want to become a nurse. Since I was 7, I wanted to be a nurse." 
</P>
<P>
Gwendolyn Johnson beamed with pride as she looked across the room at her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my best friend," she said.

SUPER WEATHER DUE FOR SUPER BOWL WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drag the television out into the front yard, get a deck chair and some snacks. 
This is one Super Bowl weekend when the weather will be so superb it would be a 
crime to spend any of it indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of sunshine and seasonal temperatures are expected through Sunday, said 
National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. A cold front passing 
through San Diego today will blow away the warm Santa Anas of earlier this week 
and make for a very pleasant weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weak Santa Ana winds will develop tonight to keep things breezy, but they will 
not pack much warmth, Shigehara said. Nights will remain on the chilly side. 
</P>
<P>
The normal high for this time of year is about 66 degrees, Shigehara said. The 
high at Lindbergh Field Wednesday was 78 degrees, and on Thursday it was 77 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Beach highs today through Sunday will range from 65 to 68 degrees, Shigehara 
said. The surf is at 3 to 5 feet and the ocean water is 58. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs this weekend are expected to be from 65 to 70. Overnight lows of 
45 to 50 are forecast tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Highs inland today will be between 72 and 77 degrees, and between 68 and 74 on 
Super Bowl weekend, Shigehara said. Lows will be from 35 to 45 tonight and 
Saturday night, he said.

A father rescued his family of six Thursday morning from a house filled with 
carbon monoxide, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The family went to sleep in its Encanto house about 8 p.m. Wednesday, but when 
Mack Toney, 27, awoke at 6:30 a.m., he felt disoriented, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Toney telephoned a nearby family member who called for help. 
</P>
<P>
The family was taken to Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa at 8:21 a.m. and placed 
in a hyperbaric chamber, treated and released. The chamber is a specially 
equipped pressure vessel used to administer oxygen at high pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials blamed the incident on two side plates missing from the house's 
forced-air heater. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were very, very lucky," a Fire Department spokesman said. "People 
need to, especially in this type of weather, check their furnace and make sure 
that it's clean. But if you do more than clean it and change the filter, get a 
professional because otherwise it becomes basically a lethal weapon then."

WITH ELWAY OUT IN 1978, SHORT-TIMER PASSED TEST; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: SUBSTITUTE WALTER SEYMOUR DELIVERED FOUR CONSECUTIVE 
VICTORIES FOR GRANADA HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Starting at quarterback in place of John Elway will be Walter Seymour." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words were spewed forth over the public-address system at the Granada 
Hills High football field moments before a game in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The 900 or so fans in attendance that night had to be excused for having a 
stunned, deer-in-the-headlights look on their faces when they heard the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, the premier prep quarterback in the nation, was being replaced by a guy 
named Walter? 
</P>
<P>
And when Seymour trotted onto the field for the first time, the eyes of the 
spectators grew even wider and their jaws dropped a bit more. For not only had 
the 6-foot-2, cannon-armed Elway been replaced by a guy named Walter, he had 
been replaced by a guy who stood just 5-foot-9. In cleats. And weighed about 
150 pounds. With his helmet on. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty quiet out there that night," Seymour recalled. "Very quiet, now 
that I think of it." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, who will lead the Denver Broncos into Sunday's Super Bowl against the 
San Francisco 49ers, had sustained a knee injury a week earlier in a game 
against San Fernando. Jack Neumeier, then the Granada Hills coach, learned on 
that fateful Monday that Elway's high school career -- and, he figured, his own 
-- was over. 
</P>
<P>
But he instructed his players to keep it a secret, not wishing to give any 
advantage to the next week's opponent, Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
This helped to account for the silence that greeted the news that night that 
Seymour, who had not played football in his life until just a year earlier and 
whose varsity career at that moment consisted of about five minutes of garbage 
time, was replacing the best high school quarterback in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of this pressure, Seymour, one would assume, fell flat on his face. 
Threw perhaps a half-dozen interceptions. Maybe lofted a few passes into the 
school bus parking lot before Neumeier could find another body with an arm 
attached to it and yank Seymour back into the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, isn't quite what transpired. What did happen was that Seymour 
played brilliantly, leading Granada Hills to three consecutive regular-season 
victories and earning the team a berth in the City Section playoffs, in which 
he came within one completion of sending the Highlanders into the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Which wasn't bad at all for a kid who was pulled aside in a 10th-grade gym 
class by an assistant football coach and asked whether he might be interested 
in learning the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I found him in one of my P. E. classes and noticed what a terrific arm he had 
for such a little, skinny kid," said then-assistant and now co-head Coach 
Darryl Stroh. 
</P>
<P>
"He played for the junior varsity in 11th grade and then became Elway's backup. 
He never got any snaps in practice and played real briefly at the end of two 
games. But then John got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The injury, torn cartilage in Elway's left knee, required surgery. The coaches 
and players could not have been more shocked had they learned their starting 
center for the past three years was actually a woman on a steroid rampage. 
</P>
<P>
"When John went out, it let a lot of air out of our balloon," Stroh said. "He 
was our everything. He was on his way to setting all the national high school 
records. And the only guy behind him was Walter Seymour. I recall the general 
feeling at that point was something like, 'Oh, gee. Our season is over.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said the first day of practice after Elway's injury didn't exactly 
reset the mood on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw five interceptions that first day," he said. "I could hear the coaches 
moaning." 
</P>
<P>
Then the games began. 
</P>
<P>
And Seymour was dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game, he threw for 254 yards and one touchdown and ran for another 
in a 34-7 stomping of Monroe. In his second game, he passed for 288 yards and 
threw four touchdown passes in a 55-0 win over Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Then, against Mid-Valley League rival Kennedy, in a game that would lock up a 
playoff berth for the winner, Seymour threw one touchdown pass and ran for two 
more touchdowns in a 21-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable story continued the next week as Granada Hills defeated 
Palisades, 31-12, in the first round of the 4-A playoffs. Seymour passed for 
243 yards and ran for one touchdown, moving Granada Hills into the semifinals 
against top-seeded and undefeated Carson. Granada Hills came back from a 12-6 
deficit to take a 19-12 lead late in the game, but Carson tied the score and 
won in overtime, 20-19, on a tiebreaker system. 
</P>
<P>
The story had ended for Granada Hills and Seymour. But it was one they still 
talk about on the Highlanders' campus. 
</P>
<P>
"What we found out that season," Stroh said, "was that we had the two best 
quarterbacks in the area on our team. John Elway and Walter Seymour." 
</P>
<P>
Today, that kind of talk makes Seymour, 29, a bit uncomfortable. He knew he 
could throw a football, but it took only a few seconds in 1978 for him to 
understand that he didn't throw a football like Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw him throw, my eyes got real wide," he said. "The first 
time I met John we started playing catch on the sideline with him." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction was, 'Ow,' " he said. "He threw footballs that whistled. He 
was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, who played one season at Moorpark College before his football career 
ended, is an X-ray technician. Coincidentally, he works for Dr. Robert 
Rosenfeld, the Los Angeles Raiders' team orthopedic physician. And once a year, 
Elway comes home to battle the Raiders at the Coliseum and the two friends 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I see him before the game and we talk for a while," Seymour said. "The last 
time, he saw me first and called me over. We were friends, on the field and off 
the field, but I try not to be a pain when we meet before a game. I figure he's 
got thousands of guys like me coming up to him all the time yelling, 'Hey, 
John. Remember me?' I don't want to be like that. That's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
And while the meetings have been brief, they bring Seymour and Elway back a 
decade. They talk of their high school days. And sometimes, the meetings make 
Seymour wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back, I have mixed feelings," he said. "Most of the time I think 
it was fun, just being on the same team with John. But other times, I think 
about what might have happened if I was at a different school and didn't have a 
John Elway playing ahead of me. Because of the situation, no one ever noticed 
me and I never got a chance to play football at a Division I school or get a 
scholarship. And I know that I threw the ball as well as a lot of guys who did 
get Division I scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't dwell on it. John Elway came to Granada Hills, and that was that." 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, as Seymour settles onto a couch like tens of millions of other 
people to watch Elway and the 49ers' Joe Montana fling footballs into the 
artificial light of the New Orleans Superdome, he will have at least one 
thought that no one else will have: 
</P>
<P>
The night of the exploding beans. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the beach with some beer and a big fire going," Seymour recalled. 
"John tossed a can of beans into the fire to heat them up, but then, well, we 
were drinking some beer, and we just forgot. About an hour later, boom, the can 
just explodes in our faces and John and I are jumping around, covered with 
beans and glowing embers from the fire. It was hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember how hard we laughed that night."

GONZAGA KNOWS HOW TO PLAY LOYOLA BUT ISN'T PHYSICAL ENOUGH TO DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not hard to get veteran Gonzaga basketball Coach Dan Fitzgerald to praise 
Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
He came to bury them, but even before the game last weekend he doubted that his 
struggling team could stay with the highly ranked Lions. Loyola won handily, 
144-100, thanks to an 85-point second half. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fitzgerald's team lost to Loyola three times, though the Bulldogs 
were more competitive then. "I think we know how to play Loyola Marymount. I 
think we have a concept, but I don't know if we have enough physical strength." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga gets another shot at the Lions in Spokane on Saturday. The only other 
ranked team on the Gonzaga schedule, Oregon State, beat the Bulldogs there in 
December before falling to Loyola the next week. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald says the Lions may be the best team in the West Coast Conference in 
several years. "They're pretty good," he said. "With the right draw, they're 
capable of winning a couple of games (in the NCAA Tournament), maybe making the 
final 16. Their leadership is good. They're senior-oriented. Their chemistry is 
really good. You don't like to see anybody get hurt, but I think Hank (Gathers) 
going down (he fainted in a game in early December) and them continuing to win 
helped their confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, who doubles as Gonzaga's athletic director and is in his eighth 
year as coach, feels Loyola is susceptible to a powerful front line -- the 
Lions' last loss was administered by Xavier and its 6-10 stars Tyrone Hills and 
Derek Strong -- but Fitzgerald likes the look of the Lions and is a bit envious 
of their athletic ability. In Spokane, Fitzgerald rarely gets pro prospects -- 
even John Stockton was a lightly regarded recruit -- and generally has to build 
his team around one or two good players. 
</P>
<P>
He especially likes the play of Bo Kimble, who is healthy for the first time in 
his three seasons at Loyola and is leading the nation in scoring. Coming off 
arthroscopic surgery last year, Kimble still had a 40-point game against 
Gonzaga in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have felt all along Bo was their best player," Fitzgerald said. 
"Now all of a sudden he is their best player. You're seeing Bo at a stretch 
where he's healthy. He's playing harder. NBA contracts do amazing things for 
the soul." 
</P>
<P>
If any WCC team is going to make noise in the NCAAs, Fitzgerald cautions that 
it better be Loyola this year. There are no young players in the WCC who show 
the dominant form of Kimble and Hank Gathers and no blue-chip recruits in the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't get transfers like Gathers and Kimble. That's once in a 
lifetime," Fitzgerald said. "You don't get two (NBA) first-round picks 
normally. (Loyola) will be decent again next year. But they'll be back 
breathing the same air as the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
The Ratings Game: When nearly every top-ranked basketball team in the nation 
got beaten over the weekend, Loyola Marymount figured to go up in the national 
ratings. But a six-game winning streak, a scoring average of 120.2 points and 
two victories last weekend by an average score of 137.5-103 apparently failed 
to sway voters, who dropped the Lions one or two spots in every major poll. 
They fell from 21st to 22nd in the Associated Press poll and to 23rd in USA 
Today-CNN -- which are selected by the media -- and dropped out of the United 
Press International Top 20, a poll of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Among the incongruities is that Oregon State and LaSalle rose several spots. 
Loyola has beaten both of them on their courts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the perplexed is Gonzaga's Fitzgerald, who said after losing by 44 points 
to the Lions last week: "The thing I don't understand is how Loyola can beat 
Oregon State and LaSalle and still be ranked behind them. But that's something 
for you guys in the press who vote on it to figure out." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the coaches don't quite have the handle, either. Oregon State is 
rated 16th and LaSalle 18th in the UPI poll. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Goggin, who played basketball at Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1985-89, 
this week was named the female recipient of the NCAA Division II Woody Hayes 
Scholar Athlete Award announced at Ohio State. Goggin was one of two unanimous 
choices for the awards, which are given to a male and female in each of the 
three NCAA divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin and her parents will be in Columbus for the awards presentation today. 
Goggin, a Long Beach native, played center for four seasons. Off the court she 
compiled a 3.88 grade-point average at Dominguez Hills, winning Academic 
All-American honors three times. She was a finalist for the Walter Byers NCAA 
Postgraduate Scholarship and a finalist for a Rhodes Scholarship. "It's nice to 
finally bring one home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin is doing doctoral work in psychology in a joint program at UC San Diego 
and San Diego State. She joins 1987 Dominguez Hills graduate John Nojima in 
winning the scholar-athlete award. 
</P>

Toro Roster News: Sophomore basketball guard Michael Bell, who started seven 
games, quit the Dominguez Hills team before last weekend's games, citing 
personal reasons. Senior swingman Kevin Shaw, who has missed several games with 
a bruised kidney, has received medical clearance to rejoin the team. And it 
appears that Vico Nomaaea will not rejoin the team. The one-time Toro shooting 
guard, who returned to the Southland last fall after a two-year Mormon mission 
in Samoa, has moved back to Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: The Loyola Marymount men's basketball team shot 59% in each 
victory last weekend, making a combined 109 of 185 shots against Gonzaga and 
Portland. In four games in the West Coast Conference, the Lions are shooting 
56% and averaging 126.8 points.

SHORTY THE PANTHER; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH GUARD BOBBY SEARS MAY BE SMALL, BUT HE'S A LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: EX-INGLEWOOD HIGH STAR BOBBY SEARS HAS ADJUSTED TO A 
RESERVE ROLE AS A SOPHOMORE AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. NEXT YEAR, THOUGH, THE 6-2 
SEARS PLANS TO TAKE CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
He was known as "The Panther" when he prowled the backcourt at Inglewood High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Long Beach, they call sophomore Bobby Sears "Shorty." 
</P>
<P>
Quick, cat-like, the 6-foot-2 guard has had an impact off the bench again this 
season for the resurgent 49er basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
His playing time per game (14 minutes) and points per game (3.6) are down a bit 
from a year ago, when he was named to the all-Big West Freshmen Team and was 
selected Prime Ticket Player of the Game for a 16-point effort in a televised 
win over USC. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sears, the shortest of all 49er regulars, has played in every game since 
he came to the school. 
</P>
<P>
He appears in line to inherit the Long Beach point guard spot now held by 
senior Tyrone Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby is very important to us," said Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington. "We only 
have four guards on this team, and he is the only true point guard we have." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter in high school, Sears says he sees basketball differently 
as a reserve, and that helps him when he enters the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good role for me, coming off the bench," he said. "I try to pick up the 
tempo, give the team a quick spark." 
</P>
<P>
A skinny kid, Sears has nevertheless gained 20 pounds since high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get stronger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sears has taken some good-natured ribbing about his size from his 49er 
teammates. He says he hopes to gain another 20 pounds in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington said that is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on a weight program now," Harrington said. "It's not an off-season 
program. He's doing it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Combs, who coached Sears in high school, agrees with Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely thin," Combs said. "You can post him up because he is very 
strong, but he can use some weight." 
</P>
<P>
Sears says the extra weight has made him quicker, a better player. Defensively, 
however, good opponents have driven around him this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself drafted by professional basketball after my senior year if I work 
hard in the weight room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Could he be called a dreamer, too? 
</P>
<P>
Said Inglewood High's Combs: "If he continues to mature, I picture him maybe 
being draftable." 
</P>
<P>
Sears has had his share of exposure at Long Beach. In a game against Purdue 
last year, a photographer snapped a shot of him dribbling toward the basket. 
Harrington believes in spreading exposure among players, even underclassmen, so 
he authorized the school's media relations office to put the photo on the 
49ers' color schedule poster. Sears has reaped benefits from it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been good for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sweet poster," said his roommate and teammate, forward Kevin Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County school for the handicapped requested a visit from "that guy on 
the poster," and recently, at a pizza parlor near the campus, teen-agers picked 
Sears out of a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Sears has taken it all in stride, according to Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
"His head is not up in the clouds," Cutler said. "To Shorty, it's probably just 
another picture. If it was me on the thing, I would be selling it." 
</P>
<P>
Sears was dubbed "Shorty" by Cutler, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound junior forward, who 
shares Sears' love for pizza and Volkswagen Beetles. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I met Bobby, I was going to buy a Cadillac," Cutler said recently while 
giving a tour of the pair's tiny sleeping quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sears can rub off on people, Combs said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great floor leader," he said. "He is just a great kid to be around." 
</P>
<P>
In his junior year at Inglewood, Sears was considered one of the South Bay's 
best players, but a year later junior Harold Minor, currently starting at USC, 
burst onto the scene, grabbing headlines with 27 points and 11 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
After a fine summer season in which he was heavily recruited, Sears suddenly 
found himself in the back seat as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that Sears, who turned down Kansas and signed early with Long 
Beach, didn't like being second fiddle to Minor. 
</P>
<P>
Combs heard the rumors, too, but denied they were true. Sears' leadership 
abilities, according to Combs, came through in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby was smart enough to realize his job was to get the ball to a kid (Minor) 
that could do it (score) from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Combs said, "I had to sit on Bobby sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids that can shoot well, like Bobby, want to put it up a lot," Combs 
said. "Once he realized what his role was, he would do what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sears characterized his play at Inglewood as "not great, but good." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes Combs had to sit on me. I would get too flashy," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
With Mitchell gone next year, Sears isn't hiding the fact he wants to replace 
him as team captain. 
</P>
<P>
"That is up to the team," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sears: "I would be glad to accept the responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
While showing off their dorm room the other day, Sears and Cutler gave their 
only chair -- a weathered wicker seat -- to a visitor. The players stretched 
out on two single beds. Several copies of Hot VW magazine shared shelf space 
with a copy of the Old Testament and books titled "Black Psychology" and 
"Marriage and Families." 
</P>
<P>
They delighted in a color television (with a coat-hanger antenna). They said 
they hoped to get an area rug, a microwave and a refrigerator soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't have room for a plant, though," Sears said. 
</P>
<P>
A poster of a red Porsche automobile was on the wall over Sears' bed, a black 
panther curled up on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
Next season as a starter, Shorty said, the panther will be on the prowl again.

ROLLING HILLS 3-POINTERS OVERCOME LEUZINGER LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never underestimate the comeback power of the three-point shot. Especially when 
Steve Clover and Chad Heitzler, long-range specialists for Rolling Hills High 
School, are doing the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger's basketball team learned that lesson the hard way Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 13 points with just under five minutes to play, Rolling Hills 
caught the Olympians in a hailstorm of three-pointers and pulled out a 73-72 
Bay League victory on Heitzler's two free throws with four seconds remaining at 
Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found ourselves yet," said Titans Coach Cliff Warren, whose team is 
still in the bottom half of the league with a 3-6 record. "But this has to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost the feeling of invincibility that we've always had at Rolling 
Hills. We're going to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
However, even the optimistic Warren said he had given up hope of a victory when 
the Titans still trailed, 67-57, with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players to cut it close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clover and Heitzler did more than that. The guards, who combined for 25 of 
Rolling Hills' 29 fourth-quarter points, each hit three three-pointers in the 
last 4 1/2 minutes to account for their team's last six baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Heitzler capped the onslaught with a trey following a steal by Clover to put 
the Titans ahead, 69-68, with 1:28 left, their first lead since early in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After Leuzinger guard Marvin Felix and Clover each hit two free throws, the 
Olympians took their final lead when Felix sank a leaning bank shot in the key 
with 15 seconds left to make it 72-71. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills managed to get the ball up court against Leuzinger's pressure and 
into the hands of Heitzler, who was fouled by Felix as he penetrated along the 
left base line. After a Leuzinger timeout, the junior sank both ends of the 
one-and-one to send the Olympians to a demoralizing defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills improved to 11-10 overall. Leuzinger dropped to 11-6 and 5-4 in 
league play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a joke, one big joke," Leuzinger Coach Phil Sherman said. "I've never 
been involved with anything like that in my life as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Then, sarcastically, he said: "It takes talent to lose a 13-point lead in the 
last five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman was most disappointed with his team's defense down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a man-to-man to crowd their guys (Clover and Heitzler) and make 
them take twos," he said. "And, low and behold, they got threes." 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed in the last-minute heroics was an outstanding all-around effort by 
Rolling Hills center Roger Hendrix. The 6-foot-6 junior led the Titans with 26 
points and 13 rebounds, and almost single-handedly kept them close while Clover 
struggled in the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Before hitting his last three shots, Clover was three of 17 from the floor. The 
6-4 Pepperdine recruit finished with 21 points, 13 in the fourth quarter, and 
five three-pointers. He had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's feeling a little strained," Warren said of Clover, who has been bothered 
by bronchitis most of the season. "He didn't shoot well. Fortunately, I've 
taught him to have no conscience. I want him to shoot. I don't care if a guy is 
draped all over him." 
</P>
<P>
Heitzler added 15 points for the Titans, 12 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger received a stellar game from 6-5 forward Adrian McCovey, who led all 
scorers with 33 points, including 12 in the final quarter. Forward Tyrone 
Merriweather added 12 and Felix had 10. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, it was Rolling Hills' day. 
</P>
<P>
"Down by 13 points on a warm day in a hostile gym," said Warren, shaking his 
head at the thought of his team's comeback. "My God, that is something, isn't 
it?"

Division, scored two goals in the final four minutes to pull out a 2-0 Marmonte 
League victory over unranked Royal at Simi Valley on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about losing," Simi Valley Coach Mark Johnson said. "I was 
worried about going into overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Royal Coach Kevin Corley said he was not dejected despite the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"What this shows me is that we can play with the No. 1 team," he said. "To keep 
it close for that long was an accomplishment for us." 
</P>
<P>
Royal sweeper Stevie Campbell touched the ball with her hand within the 
Highlanders' penalty area, setting up sophomore Amy Hunter's scoring penalty 
kick with four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>

as goalkeeper Elana Tuizer relied on a defense that did not allow a shot on 
goal. Grant (12-2, 8-0) jumped to a 3-0 halftime lead on three goals by Amanda 
Walzer, who has scored more than 80 goals during her high school career. Walzer 
moved to defense in the second half, and Anne Remmers, Valerie Pearce and Pam 
Williams scored for host Grant. Chaminade 3, Notre Dame 0 -- Chaminade goalie 
Kathy Regan earned her 12th shutout of the season in a San Fernando Valley 
League match at Chaminade. Chaminade (16-2-2, 3-1-1), ranked third in the

Alta-Pasadena Christian received two technicals early in the nonleague game at 
Glendale Academy for not entering two players in the score book. Alta-Pasadena 
Christian's walkout reportedly was precipitated by two technicals, one on an 
Alta-Pasadena Christian player and the other on a coach, that were called in

SAN PASQUAL'S MEEK CONTINUES TO DRAW A CROWD; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: BUT WHETHER HE'S ENGULFED IN A SEA OF DEFENDERS OR A ROOMFUL OF 
RECRUITERS, THE 6-10 JUNIOR CENTER STANDS OUT.

Tom Buck, San Pasqual's basketball coach, points to the spot where Erik Meek 
stood that day, engulfed by five Escondido players. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a zone that had everyone in the lane, daring our other players to 
shoot the ball," Buck said. "The rest of our team went something like five for 
25, and we lost. But I think Erik still had 30 points." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido High Coach Mike Williams also vividly recalls the game two seasons 
ago, in Meek's freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Brooks Barnhard (now a freshman at University of San Diego) fronting 
him and another big guy behind him, and the other players were pretty close 
by," Williams said. "We were really successful playing him that way for two 
years. Once, we actually held him to 12 or 14 points. But that's because we got 
him into foul trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The attention surrounding Meek, a 6-foot-10, 220-pound junior, has subsided on 
the court, because teammates have begun to take pressure off by shooting 
better. But as Meek has grown into his game -- and closer to college -- 
attention off the court has become so intense that his father, Greg, has 
quarantined him from recruiters until he is senior. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, San Pasqual practices lately have played host to a Who's Who of 
college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, on the opening day of the week-long NCAA evaluation period, UCLA Coach 
Jim Harrick and Arizona State assistant Lynn Archibald dropped by to make their 
presence known -- even though they had long ago favorably evaluated of Meek. 
</P>
<P>
Others taking a peek at Meek included Arizona's Lute Olson, Arizona State's 
Bill Frieder and Notre Dame's Digger Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk to them, so I just try to go with my day as though they're not 
even there," Meek said. "But it's kind of hard with all those eyes looking at 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters are also writing Meek an average of 10 letters a day, with 
Vanderbilt, Arizona State and UCLA spending the most money on postage. 
</P>
<P>
The phone also rings quite a bit at the Meek house these days, though all the 
calls are intercepted by Greg. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad they call, and we appreciate it," Greg Meek said. "But we've set 
down some guidelines. We're not playing any games, and nobody is playing games 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few coaches Greg Meek will not identify. He says he did not like 
their initial pitches, and they have been told they would be wasting their time 
recruiting his son. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Meek also said he and his son will not wilt under the pressure of the 
recruiters, meaning he will tell Erik not to commit during the early signing 
period in October if he's not absolutely certain of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing the early signing period does is getting the coaches off his 
back," Greg Meek said. "I think it's great for a kid who has grown up in 
Indiana and wanted to play there since sixth grade. But not for kids like 
Erik." 
</P>
<P>
With early signing less than nine months away, it appears Meek is nowhere near 
a decision. He has not even narrowed his choices down to eight or 10 schools 
yet, although he said that time is coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair for all these schools to waste their time and effort if I'm not 
going to go there," Meek said. "So I'm sure after the season, I'll get it down 
to less than 10 schools." 
</P>
<P>
Meek, who has a 3.3 grade-point average, said he will look at a college's 
academics and then its basketball program. Geography doesn't seem to concern 
the Meeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's education we need to be concerned with," Greg Meek said. "Erik's 
importance to the world is that he's a good person. It's nice that he's a good 
basketball player, too, but we realize if he gets hurt, that could all end in a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Meek said his son has handled every situation pretty well so far, 
including an incident last week at a UCLA game when the student body stood up 
and chanted, "We want Meek." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't get impressed with it," Greg Meek said. "I told him, 'It's nice, 
but it's programmed.' None of the students knew who Erik was." 
</P>
<P>
But coaches certainly do. Nearly every Division I school has written to him. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting services also know him. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gibbons of All-Star Sports rates Meek as the second-best junior big man on 
the West Coast. Cherokee Parks of Huntington Beach Marina High, who also rated 
a chant at UCLA, is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Cherokee's a little more advanced offensively, but Erik's a little stronger," 
Gibbons said. "Parks is a little more accomplished all around. But both players 
will be among the top five big men in the United States and top 20 (players) 
overall." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said Meek is probably the most heavily recruited player in San Diego 
since Bill Walton was at Helix in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not Bill Walton, but in his own right, he has to be considered a player 
who will make a major impact on the college level," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Buck realizes, because Meek is a post player and plays in this area, that 
comparisons to Walton are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not fair to Erik," Buck said. "There's only one Bill Walton, but I 
will say this. Erik's doing things Bill Walton never got the opportunity to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Such as spending his vacations competing against the top players in the nation 
at the Nike Camp in Princeton, N.J., and driving to Los Angeles to play against 
that area's best in a summer league. 
</P>
<P>
Meek has held his own when he's been matched against the nation's elite 
players, but he realized last summer that his game is still missing some 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the best, and I couldn't believe how quick some of these people 
were," Meek said. "I want to get a lot more athletic. By lifting weights and 
working on my quickness, I think I am getting there." 
</P>
<P>
Though his ego has taken a beating on occasion against blue-chip talent, Meek's 
shining moment occured last Easter at a tournament in Las Vegas. While 
competing with his Los Angeles All-Star team, he outplayed 7-5 Shawn Bradley of 
Utah, who has signed with Brigham Young. Meek was later named tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryan Banner, who guards Meek in practice, remembers the days before the 
MVP honors and the letters starting rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first played with him in seventh grade, he couldn't do much," Banner 
said. "He wasn't very coordinated. He was just big." 
</P>
<P>
Now Meek is big, coordinated and, Banner says, simply unstoppable at times. 
</P>
<P>
"When he drives, it's nearly impossible to stop him," said Banner, who plays 
one-on-one against Meek almost every day after practice. "His jumping ability, 
his balance and his speed have all improved. 
</P>
<P>
Banner said the only thing that ever wavers is Meek's mental game. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, his mind wanders," said Banner, a 6-5 senior. "He doesn't stay 
focused all the time. Sometimes I'll yell at him at halftime and tell him we 
need to start doing more." 
</P>
<P>
Buck said some of the one-on-one battles between the two have been epics. 
</P>
<P>
"When those guys play one-on-one, it's serious," Buck said. "They just beat the 
tar out of each other. Everybody has to clear out of the way when they play." 
</P>
<P>
Banner, who is averaging 16 points this season for ninth-ranked San Pasqual 
(12-5), has given Meek some room to breath during games. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan has taken a lot of the pressure off me," Meek said. "This year has been 
a lot better for me because of Bryan and some of the other players. Things are 
a lot more spread out for me now." 
</P>
<P>
The balanced San Pasqual attack has allowed Meek, once a one-man gang, to 
branch out and work on other aspects of his game. Meek's shots per game might 
be down this year, but his shooting percentage (68%) and scoring (27.1) are 
both up considerably from last year's 59% and 22.6. His rebounding average has 
stayed at about 11, but that can be attributed to Banner, whose average is up 
to 12 from 7.6. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman for San Pasqual's 4-18 team, Meek averaged 19.8 points and once 
scored 38 against Mt. Carmel's Shane Knight, who is headed for BYU next year. 
</P>
<P>
"He just did some things very well as a freshman," said Ramona Coach Al 
Schaffer before Meek scored 25 points against his Bulldogs Wednesday night in a 
73-45 San Pasqual victory. "But now he's running the floor better, and he seems 
to have improved his all-around game. The thing I like about him is if he makes 
a mistake, he doesn't let it bother him." 
</P>
<P>
Not much seems to bother Meek, including pesky recruiters and five-on-one 
defenses.

HOOVER HIGH TO CELEBRATE GYM'S 50TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAZELTINE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not much has changed inside the Hoover High School gymnasium in the 50 years 
since Johnny Babick, Rupe Crosthwaite, Bob Gremmett, Percy Hussong, Roy Muelchi 
and Jack Siegel had their names announced before the start of a high school 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
The rectangular wooden backboards have been replaced by glass, the school has 
added a couple of championship banners, and murals grace two of the inside 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
But a step inside the Hoover gym is otherwise like a step backward in time. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Babick, Crosthwaite, Gremmett, Hussong, Muelchi and Siegel will again 
be taking another walk to midcourt before the start of Hoover's City Central 
League game against Madison. This is fitting; they were part of the first 
Hoover varsity team to trot out after the gym was built for the 1939-40 season. 
</P>
<P>
The group will be honored along with other players who participated in that 
first game on Nov. 28, 1939, as Hoover celebrates the building's 50th 
anniversary before tonight's 7:15 tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
Others to be honored include Max Fitzenmeyer, Charlie Hampton, Ray Minor, Bob 
White and Walt Woodbury, all of whom played on the alumni team that defeated 
the Hoover varsity in that first game. Hampton, who later coached the Cardinals 
for 11 years, led all scorers with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hoover gym has been more than just the site of 2,000-plus high school 
games. Hoover has also seen the air balls of recreation leagues and slam dunks 
of NBA players. The Boston Celtics, Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers have 
practiced there, along with several foreign teams in training for the 1984 
Olympics. And all -- one estimate is 50,000 games -- have been played on the 
same oak floor. 
</P>
<P>
The original floor was an inch thick, nearly twice the depth of those installed 
today. An eighth-inch was sanded off after it was damaged by a 1980 flood. 
</P>
<P>
The gym has proved a great investment, considering the number of games it has 
staged. It was built for $185,000 -- or a little less than the average price of 
a new home in the county today. RICK HAZELTINE

PEOPLE: UNISYS CHIEF TO RETIRE, WILL JOIN LAZARD FRERES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys Corp. chairman and chief executive, will retire 
in April to join the investment banking firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. as a 
limited partner, Unisys said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal, 64, will remain chairman of the Unisys board, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Detroit, the company's board chose President James A. Unruh, 48, to 
assume the additional duties of chief executive after Blumenthal's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"After almost two decades of managing major industrial companies and 10 years 
at Burroughs and Unisys, the time has come for my long-planned retirement," 
Blumenthal said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal, who engineered Burroughs Corp.'s 1986 takeover of Sperry Corp. to 
form Unisys, was Treasury secretary in the Carter Administration. He indicated 
last year that he planned to retire shortly. 
</P>
<P>
At New York-based Lazard Freres, Blumenthal will serve as co-chairman of a new 
international investment group, his statement said.

TREASURY BONDS SLUMP AGAIN, WIPE OUT RALLY

<P>
Prices of Treasury bonds sagged again Thursday, reversing course at midday in a 
drop that erased a modest rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which has fallen more than a point over 
the past two sessions, lost another 9/16 point, or just over $5 for every 
$1,000 in face value. It had been up more than 1/4 point in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which rises when prices fall, advanced to 8.46% from 8.40% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders had said the early rally effort was a reaction to the recent 
selloff and didn't imply any fundamental improvement in market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The market has been depressed all week by worries that U.S. investments may be 
losing their allure for foreigners, particularly the Japanese. Rising interest 
rates abroad are making foreign investments more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, down from 8.375 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Is Mostly Lower; Gold Mixed 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed mostly lower as a variety of rumors heightened trader fears 
about foreign investment in the United States. Gold prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency suffered its largest drop against the Japanese yen after 
reports that Japanese institutional investors were selling large amounts of 
dollars, said Robert Ryan, senior trader at Bank of New York Co. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that the Federal Reserve was selling dollars against the yen also took 
a toll, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slumped to 143.925 yen in New York from late Wednesday's 145.715 
yen. In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar fell 0.50 yen to 145.30 yen, and in 
London, it was quoted late in the day at 144.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said the dollar was also hurt by a report that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
was calling for a withholding tax on foreigners investing in the United States. 
Such a move would discourage foreign investment in this country, and in turn, 
foreign demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Greenspan cautioned Congress in testimony Thursday against placing any 
new impediments on foreign investment, saying it would force interest rates 
higher and "probably curb economic activity." 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6570 from $1.6555 late Wednesday. In 
later New York dealings, the pound rose to $1.6600 from $1.65255. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold 
fell $1.20 to $416, but Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $417 an 
ounce, up 40 cents from Wednesday. 
</P>

COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Oil Prices Rally on Storm Fears 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rallied on fears that the worst storm to hit Britain since a 1987 
hurricane may disrupt the flow of North Sea oil. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, wheat, corn and oat futures prices sank; sugar 
futures were up sharply; pork bellies soared while livestock futures were 
mixed, and precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange still 
managed to close with a gain of 65 cents in the March contract, to $22.24 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
February unleaded gasoline finished 1.22 cents higher at 60.60 cents per 
gallon, and February heating oil regained some of its recent steep losses to 
end 0.20 cent higher at 59.77 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices sank to four-month lows on the Chicago Board of Trade and 
soybean futures reached their lowest levels since mid-October in a selloff 
linked to wetter weather and slack demand for feed grains both domestically and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 2 to 6 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
March down 6 cents at $3.855 a bushel, the lowest settlement of a near-month 
wheat contract since Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans ended 7.50 to 8.25 cents lower, with March down 7.75 cents at $5.5825 
a bushel, the lowest daily settlement for near-month soybeans since Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures settled 1.25 to 2.25 cents lower, with March at $2.3925 a bushel; 
oats were unchanged to 2 cents lower, with March at $1.37 a bushel.

Union Carbide Corp.: The chemical company said fourth-quarter profit plunged 
71% to $47 million, partly because of shutdown and personnel costs resulting 
from the restructuring of its industrial gas subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The Danbury, Conn., company said the results included a $56-million after-tax 
charge associated with the restructuring. Sales for the 1989 period were down 
3% to $2.1 billion. For the full year, profit fell 13% to $662 million and 
sales rose 5% to $8.74 billion.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: 1990 JAGUAR GETS TRADITIONALISTS' MOTORS PURRING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After its recent $2.5-billion buyout of Jaguar Cars, Ford Motor Co. could be 
excused for declaring July 4 a factory holiday here and Americanizing brochures 
that refer to bonnets, fascia colours and spare tyres in boots. 
</P>
<P>
But to change one whit or the wildcat in Jaguar's new, elegant, more powerful 
but less expensive XJ6 would be an unforgivable breach of Anglo-American 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Correction. Ford might like to shine one small inspection light on Jaguar's 
electrical system -- and in particular the company's lasting dedication to the 
flickering equipment manufactured by British-based Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's electricals have been glitch-rich for years. There was some 
improvement when Sir John Egan assumed command of Jaguar in 1980. But the 
company has yet to insulate all electrical problems, and flickers or blackout 
should not be part of any car costing more than a year's rent at the Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
On our test vehicle, the windshield wipers stopped wherever the poor dears felt 
weary. Central door locking was iffy with a key-chain remote control that kept 
flopping apart and dumping its battery. Definitely not cricket for a car built 
by a company with a knight for a CEO. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the new and vastly improved XJ6 for 1990 remains faithful to a 
bloodline that since the SS100 of the '30s and through the Jaguar XK120s and Mk 
VIIs and E-Types of the '50s and '60s has evolved into a wonderful combination 
of luxuriant muscle. 
</P>
<P>
In one of its motoring moods, the XJ6 is all leather and wood smells and 
purring graciousness fit for the royal family that, indeed, garages its Jaguars 
at Buckingham Palace. Up Brompton Road to Harrods or down Jermyn Street to 
Fortnum &amp; Mason, the XJ6 satisfies our senses of place and personal pride. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a more raucous mode, it will blast through motorway traffic with the 
howling verve expected of any direct descendant of the C- and D-Type Jaguars 
that five times conquered Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of controlled cruising, power-adjusted seating and lacquered walnut 
per square inch of door and dash trim, the XJ6 wears no more options than any 
other luxury performance car. Its straight-six, 4-liter engine is no ground 
pounder alongside the mighty V8s of Chevrolet, Ford and the heftier Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
But Jaguar has been doing it so much longer than Lexus and Infiniti, and 
there's security in that. While Mercedes or BMW opt for quantum leaps and model 
ranges aimed at market niches from basement to Beverly Hills, Jaguar prefers 
perpetual refinement of the proven. Its mechanical foundation, its straight-six 
engine, for example, hasn't changed that much since it was powering the XK 
sports car series. 
</P>
<P>
To some, that's decadent. To others, it is the creation of tradition. The 
undeniable end result is a car of familiarity and substance, offering that 
sense of enduring quality the British do so very well. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, there were quiet fears that Jaguar would be forced into 
reducing its polish and prestige. The company's U. S. sales had slumped as the 
pound strengthened and the dollar weakened. Competition in the luxury 
performance car market increased. Worse, Lexus and Infiniti were selling for 
$5,000 less than the least expensive Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar had only one hand to play. In October, the company announced a $4,300 
price cut for the XJ6. Some little luxuries would be left out. But the famed, 
pure, sweet straight-six engine would grow from 3.6 liters to 4 liters with an 
increase in horsepower from 195 to 223. 
</P>
<P>
Doubts rose. But "downgrading" and "entry level" and "down market" were phrases 
used by others in discussing the XJ6. 
</P>
<P>
"We have simply adjusted the specifications," explained a Jaguar spokesman this 
week. "The new car retains all the traditional Jaguar features -- the walnut 
trim, leather on the seats, full instrumentation -- while remaining competitive 
across a broader (market) range." 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we offered (in the United States) three models (of Jaguar) with a 
price range of $44,000 to $53,000. This year, we're simply offering four models 
ranging in price from $39,700 to $53,000. And now we're in a position to say to 
the potential Lexus buyer: 'Look, you can have a Jaguar for that (same price) 
with all that owning a Jaguar means.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even at its smaller price, the 1990 XJ6 still comes with cruise control, alloy 
wheels, air conditioning, six-speaker sound system, anti-lock braking, 
leather-faced seats, air conditioning, trip computer, power windows, seats, 
side mirrors and central locking -- but no air bag. 
</P>
<P>
Missing is last year's power sunroof; a rear load-leveling system; matched, 
burled and inlaid walnut trim (this year's wood is plain), and some brightwork 
has been muted to black. But for buyers who can't live without any of that, 
there is a fully optioned XJ6 that costs $43,000 and is now known as the 
Sovereign. 
</P>
<P>
Our test car was maroon and wearing a pair of tacky U. K. basics -- plastic 
wheel covers and fabric seats -- that we pray will never be exported to this 
country by FoMoJag. 
</P>
<P>
And in keeping with Britain's recent and thoroughly belated education in the 
horrors of hydrocarbons, nitrogen dioxides and the full range of automotive 
smog, this XJ6 came equipped with a catalytic converter (an option in the 
United Kingdom), which trimmed its performance to just about U. S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
There is no real nippiness in that performance, no snappy steering or popping 
of clutches associated with parking lot slaloms and country lane duels with 
errant Peugeot Mi16s. 
</P>
<P>
With a width of 6 1/2 feet (identical to a Rolls-Royce), the XJ6 is a little 
too beamy to hustle. With an avoirdupois of two tons (and no manual 
transmission to guarantee a polished balancing act), it certainly is a mite too 
heavy to be slinging around wet macadam. 
</P>
<P>
If pushed in tight corners, of course, the Jaguar will deliver, and with as 
much response and delicacy as any other middleweight. Its metier, however, is 
rapid touring amid the quiet comfort of a factory-made car that carries the 
heft of a hand-built one. 
</P>
<P>
And it is rapid touring. From breakfast until teatime, the Jaguar will cruise 
happily at 110 m.p.h. We became a little zealous on one stretch of the broad 
and dry M4 to London and were looking at 130 m.p.h. before coming upon the 
nuisance of a trio of lane-changing lorries. 
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of the XJ6 -- from rest or in passing mode -- is simply superb 
for a car of its bulk. Should that not be enough, Jaguar's automatic 
transmission has been equipped with a handy "sport-normal" control that in 
"sport" setting will hold each gear closer to its performance peak. 
</P>
<P>
Twice (once for the worst case scenario of a woman wheeling baby and 
perambulator into a crosswalk) we got into the anti-lock braking system. Twice 
we went against the belts as the big cat stopped dead, absolutely straight and 
without a suggestion of slither. 
</P>
<P>
The steering was neither rigid nor fluffy, the suspension neither buckboard nor 
sponge cake. By no accident. Mechanical completeness comes only from years of 
breeding; a craftsman's tweak here, an engineer's fillet there and an ounce of 
pressure all around. Until a system has progressed from adequate for some, to 
optimum for most. 
</P>
<P>
This mechanical harmony extends to the interior of the XJ6, where all dials are 
readable, handles are to hand and controls are not a symbology quiz. Night 
driving -- thanks to a perfect combination of cabin and instrument illumination 
-- is absolutely fumble-free. 
</P>
<P>
Add the comfort of club-class seating and a driving ease that allows not only 
listening but also mental conducting of Vivaldi at 100 m.p.h., and you have a 
carriage that on London-to-Edinburgh runs could well put Virgin Airways out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
You also have a car that continues to live up to its advertising claim of the 
medieval '50s. The reference was to the Jaguar Mk VII, and it was a three-word 
promise of "Grace. . .Space. . .Pace."

PHYSICIAN'S HONESTY IS A POSITIVE STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three paragraphs into your Jan. 15 profile on Dr. German Maisonet ("SCLC Honors 
Physician to the Poor"), he was quoted about how he tried not to be a "mixed-up 
gay kid." Not meaning to downplay the significance of his great efforts in 
treating and educating the poor about AIDS, I was also touched by his 
forthrightness about his sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
In this time when AIDS has so crippled the gay civil rights movement that such 
opportunistic infections as bigotry and hate crimes are on the rise; when 
police raid a valley bar on dubious charges; when a city in Orange County makes 
anti-gay discrimination, in effect, legal; when more and more teens have turned 
runaway out of sexual-orientation confusion and find few positive role models, 
Martin Luther King's SCLC acknowledges a gay man whose worth is judged on his 
kindness, generosity, compassion and human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Maisonet shows us that not only can one be gay and proud, but that a gay 
can be a powerfully positive contributor to a society that so desperately needs 
every one of its honorable and humane souls to stand tall. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, L. A. Times, for amplifying this man's contributions. Thank you, Dr. 
Maisonet, for being a hero.

'MEGA-OPTIMISTS' ARE PART OF A 'CON ACT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems to me that inanities like "Mega-Optimists" (Jan. 17) ought to be 
relegated to the astrology column where they belong. While people like the 
Naisbitts ("Megatrends 2000" authors John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene) try 
to put a veneer of respectability on their crystal ball by using computers to 
make their predictions sound like science, anyone who knows anything about 
computers or science knows that futurism is a con act. 
</P>
<P>
The reason people like the Naisbitts are popular is the same reason ancient 
kings hired prophets and modern rulers hire "experts." They tell them what they 
like to hear, and they help them sell their policies to their constituencies by 
supplying an aura of wisdom and inevitability to whatever nonsense they want 
the people to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the forecasts are rather banal stuff that any thinking person can 
predict, but let us consider a couple of the "trend" items that these people 
are so optimistic about. 
</P>
<P>
The first "trend" item that Naisbitt is trying to sell us is the idea that some 
great cosmic evolutionary force is moving us in a direction that will shift us 
from being an industrial society into one of service that is based on the 
creation and distribution of information. He even wants us to believe that we 
will benefit from this change. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the inane ideas that have been sold to the American people, the one that 
tells us that we can prosper as an economic power without making things is the 
dumbest. Information is not an end, except at universities, and information 
without a purpose is just useless gossip. 
</P>
<P>
People who think that it is OK to turn us into a service economy haven't 
thought about what a service economy really is. A trip to Mexico will make the 
issue very clear. The Mexicans know the real meaning of a service economy: They 
live in one. It means waiting on tables and shining the shoes of rich 
foreigners who can afford to do things in your own country that you can't. 
</P>
<P>
The other optimistic trend that these people keep pushing is the notion of a 
"world economy" instead of a "national economy." Again, people who think that 
this is a good direction haven't thought about the implications involved. While 
it is true that turning the world into one gigantic free market benefits 
multinational corporations because it provides them with bigger markets and a 
cheaper labor pool, it is hard to see how it can possibly be good for the rest 
of us who end up trading good paying production jobs for minimum wage work at 
fast-food stores. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Naisbitt claims, these trends are neither inevitable nor are 
they good for most of us.

THE DECEPTIVE POWER OF A CAD'S EGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grown-Ups by Victoria Glendinning (Knopf: $18.95; 244 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Taking a temporary holiday from her definitive biographies of uncommon women, 
Glendinning has written a corrosive novel centering upon the personality of the 
philanderer-philosopher Leo Ulm. 
</P>
<P>
Vain, arrogant and supremely selfish, Ulm nevertheless is able to turn 
sensible, talented women to jelly merely by raising a grizzled eyebrow and 
smiling his crooked grin. His celebrated magnetism is so obscure that "The 
Grown-Ups" virtually becomes a mystery story, as the reader struggles to 
understand wherein that charm lies. 
</P>
<P>
Persevering, we realize that the despicable Ulm offers women something rare and 
precious -- the chance to exhibit a full range of their strength and 
resilience. Like the biographies, this novel celebrates female accomplishment, 
if only by indirection. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Ulm is dead as the book opens, felled by a cerebral hemorrhage at a 
Buckingham Palace garden party. As an author, professor and television 
personality, he rates a splendid obit in The Times, but it's the life behind 
the honors and achievements that the author goes back and exposes, making the 
most of the huge gulf between the public and the private Ulm. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1960s he was the flower children's favorite thinker," and 20 years 
later, he's still offering the same Pablum to a new generation. Now 58 years 
old, Leo Ulm has gone from boy wonder to grand old man without ever doing 
anything significant in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Ulm's current wife is Martha, a willing servitor half his age. A sought-after 
illustrator of children's books, she squeezes her assignments in between Leo's 
peremptory demands, quite unaware that he's habitually unfaithful to her. 
Charlotte, the reclusive first wife, is installed in the guest cottage of the 
family estate she brought to her marriage with Leo. Their son, Ferdie Ulm, 
blinded in a childhood accident, lives in the manor house with his wife, Alice; 
their small daughter, Agnes, and the Swiss au pair. (Marriages may come and go, 
but inherited real estate is kept in the family.) 
</P>
<P>
There's more visiting back and forth between London, where Leo and Martha live, 
and Belwood, where he once resided with Charlotte, than one might expect. The 
trips provide Leo with opportunities for the sort of intermural seduction that 
so enlivens English country weekends. 
</P>
<P>
While the feminist message is always implicit, "The Grown-Ups" is essentially a 
novel of contemporary manners, designed to amuse as it cautions. One way and 
another, Leo's conquests are all acquiescent victims, coming to their senses 
only after the Almighty Equal Rights Adjuster removes him permanently from 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
On a professional junket to Washington, Leo expertly cases the delegates and 
selects a clever and alluring Frenchwoman as his diversion. Unfortunately, 
intelligence and sophistication are no defense against the overwhelming Ulm 
ego, and Emmeline Bernay becomes another casualty. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his wives, Emmeline eventually musters the energy to rid herself of the 
infatuation, baking and soaking away his memory in a warm Mediterranean bay. 
Neither Charlotte nor Martha is so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington scenes are wickedly funny, satirizing international academics at 
work and play, permitting us to see Leo gulling his peers as readily as he 
deceives his lovers. There we observe the essential Ulm, preening as he enters 
the hotel lobby to a low mutter of recognition, imagining the sound of his name 
"like a mantra" to his admirers. 
</P>
<P>
Encountering an elderly German colleague squiring his aged first wife from one 
event to another, Ulm cannot fathom why "men continue to dote on women who are 
no longer attractive or amusing." 
</P>
<P>
The incidental characters include a senescent and dotty relic of the Bloomsbury 
era, the effete young man who listens patiently to her tales of bygone high 
jinks, and Martha's dear friend, Clara, struggling to have a postmodern 
relationship with a thoroughly conventional chap who works for an insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Though these various people have little direct bearing on the fundamental issue 
of the novel, they provide almost enough diversion to make us forget that "The 
Grown-Ups" never answers the question it raises. By the end of the book, we're 
no closer to knowing why good women love worthless men than we were on Page 
One, though we may know what traits mean certain disaster.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: STILL HAUNTED BY HURRICANE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My family is still suffering from the devastating effects of 
the hurricane that destroyed our home this past year. I'm wondering how long it 
will take to recover, if ever. My elderly father seemed to take it in stride, 
but my two children (ages 5 and 7) still have nightmares. -- H.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR H.B.: Studies indicate that most people recover emotionally in about a 
year, although the trauma may last longer, especially for young children. Your 
father's resilience is typical for people his age who seem to fare better after 
natural disasters. Their wealth of experience and their attitudes toward death 
and dying seem to give them some protection that younger people don't have. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Bill Locke of Texas Tech University, who studied the aftereffects 
of a Texas tornado, found that children were emotionally fragile. Even those as 
old as 10 often regressed into clinging and infantile behavior, and there were 
some residual effects that lasted into adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors often suffer from headaches, stomach pains, bad dreams and flashbacks 
of the incident. Fatigue is also common and this may last for many months as 
families try to adjust to their losses. People get jumpy, tempers are more apt 
to flare, and family violence increases. Disasters such as you've been through 
remind us that we're not immortal and that compared with nature, humans are 
very weak. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 10-year-old daughter is a real beauty and she knows it, 
partly because people are always reminding her. I don't want her to be spoiled, 
but it's hard to avoid it. Is there anything my wife and I can do to help her 
develop into the well-rounded person we'd like to have as a daughter? -- M.A. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR M.A.: Start now to provide some role models whose successes in life have 
nothing to do with their appearances. Since she is beautiful, she has no need 
to prove it or to use her beauty to compete. Avoid beauty contests and try to 
encourage her to develop all of her talents. Build her confidence so that she's 
willing to take intellectual risks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the frequent problems that exceptionally beautiful people face is that 
they realize at an early age that they don't need to develop their minds to get 
along. Later in life the beauties often tend to feel inferior and to doubt 
themselves. They begin to question whether people like them for themselves or 
only as something to look at and display. If they feel they're only being asked 
out as an object to impress others, they end up feeling cheated. Being 
appreciated only as a lovely object is demeaning and destructive.

POP LP CHART: AFTER 81 WEEKS, ABDUL STILL REIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

international news services and the nation's press.

<TEXT>
<P>
It looks like Paula Abdul's "Forever Your Girl" may be forever in the Billboard 
magazine pop-album Top Five. This week, it's back to No. 1, pushed to the top 
by another hit single, "Opposites Attract," which is jumped six notches to No. 
2 on the pop singles chart and is a cinch to inch into the No. 1 spot next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of Top-Five action is remarkable for an album that's been on the 
chart 81 weeks. Recently it passed the 5-million mark in sales. Babyface's 
"Tender Lover" album has been a strong, steady seller, cracking the 1-million 
mark and, this week, rising to No. 19. Quincy Jones' "Back on the Block" is the 
newest entry in the Top 10 at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
* After nearly a half year on the pop chart, Harry Connick Jr.'s album, also 
big with the jazz and New Age crowd, is surging again. This week it leaped from 
No. 70 to No. 55.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / STAGE: USIU THEATER COMPANY DECIDES TO PASS ON 'DOLLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goodby, Dolly! -- at least for now. The International Musical Theatre Company 
of USIU is canceling its February production of "Hello, Dolly!" at the Lyceum 
Stage, and rescheduling it for the opening of next season at the Theatre in Old 
Town. Despite rumors to the contrary, the financially troubled university is 
not canceling for financial reasons, according to a USIU spokeswoman , but 
because "We've just concluded with regret that it's too big a bone for these 
kids to chew at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, United States International University subscribers will get "Talking 
with . . . " at the Theatre in Old Town March 15-25. And, at the Lyceum, San 
Francisco producer and theater owner Charles H. Duggan, who already had a slot 
reserved at the Lyceum Stage, will use the extra time to present "Ain't 
Misbehavin'," the Tony-award winning tribute to the music of Fats Waller, with 
the original New York cast Feb. 13-March 4, and "Jeeves Takes Charge" with its 
original London star, Edward Duke, March 13-April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't Misbehavin'," which closed Sunday in Dallas, will leave San Diego for an 
April 3-29 Tokyo run in a 1,000-seat theater, with a possible one-week stopover 
in Osaka, before returning to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Duggan had been negotiating until the eleventh hour for the San Diego rights to 
"Nunsense," which he had produced in San 
</P>
<P>
Francisco with Phyllis Diller. But the rights were not to be released for this 
city until the end of April, too close to the beginning of the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre season, he said from his office in San Francisco. Still, 
"Nunsense," starring Diller, is a good bet for next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeeves Takes Charge" was licensed by Duggan for an Old Globe Theatre 
production in 1988, but with San Diego actor Don Sparks in the one-man show 
under Duke's direction. Duggan doesn't think that will hurt sales for a "Jeeves 
Takes Charge," with the original London star -- Duke, directed by Gillian 
Lynne, the choreographer for "Phantom of the Opera" and "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
After all, he points out, the audiences came out strongly for Duggan's 
production of "Greater Tuna" with the original cast at the Lyceum Stage last 
year, which was four years after the Old Globe had produced their own version 
of "Greater Tuna" with their own cast (which included Larry Drake, now an 
Emmy-winning regular on "L.A. Law"). 
</P>
<P>
USIU, coincidentally, also had a successful run with a student cast for "Ain't 
Misbehavin' " in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And, for "Greater Tuna" groupies, Duggan reports that the sequel to "Greater 
Tuna," called "Tuna Christmas," is alive and well and playing at the Kennedy 
Center in Washington. The Texas-inspired show, still running in San Francisco 
after six years, was evidently a big hit with President Bush, who took his 
wife, Barbara, to see the show on their 45th wedding anniversary, and followed 
up the show with a breakfast for the Bushes and "Greater Tuna" stars Jaston 
Williams and Joe Sears. 
</P>
<P>
The show is due to close at the Kennedy Center on Feb. 4, which is "about the 
longest you push a Christmas show," Duggan said. But there will be a final 
performance at the White House on Feb. 28 for the Governor's Conference in the 
East Room. 
</P>
<P>
Duggan has already proposed producing "Tuna Christmas" at the Lyceum in time 
for the holiday season, but said if he is turned down (because of the show's 
possible conflict with the San Diego Rep's annual "A Christmas Carol"), he will 
pitch it elsewhere -- possibly to the Old Globe, which books rather than 
produces in December. 
</P>
<P>
"That would work out very nicely," Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Doug Jacobs, artistic director of the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre, returned to San Diego from a trip to England, Ireland and Scotland on 
Saturday night, but his wife, actress Darla Cash, was sidetracked on the New 
York stopover. Her friend, playwright Allan Havis (a professor at UC San Diego) 
wanted her to perform in the premiere of his play, "The Bartered Bride" at the 
Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn. Cash, who had done the play in a staged 
reading at the South Coast Repertory Theatre, took the role and will open in 
three weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Garrett-Groag, who directed "The Granny," still running at the Old 
Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage through Feb. 18, is one of 12 finalists in 
the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, a prize given to women playwrights. 
Garrett-Groag was honored for her play, "Ladies of the Camellias," a story 
about legendary actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse that was produced 
in the Old Globe's Play Discovery program. The winner and a runner-up will be 
announced in February. Past finalists have included Marsha Norman, Beth Henley 
and Caryl Churchill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Performing Arts Theatre for the Handicapped (PATH) just received $2,500 
from the City of Carlsbad Arts Commission to hire additional teachers and 
acting coaches. The theater, which mainstreams disabled performers, is 
presenting "The Curious Savage" in La Costa through Feb. 18. Other theaters 
among the eight arts organizations to receive grants from a $15,000 total are 
the Carlsbad Youth Theatre, which received $1,000 for a February production of 
"The Hobbit" and the Patrons of the Arts Foundation, which received $4,000 to 
produce a 1990 summer musical at the Carlsbad Community Cultural Center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In honor of Black History Month, KPBS Radio will present a 30-minute 
documentary called "August Wilson's Sacred Book," about playwright August 
Wilson, author of "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano Lesson," both of 
which played at the Old Globe Theatre, and "Fences." The show airs Feb. 17 at 4 
p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Baldridge, better known locally as a public-relations officer at the 
Old Globe Theatre, is the writer of "Winter Roses," playing at the Itchey Foot 
Ristorante in Los Angeles today and Saturday.

Jackson's Show to Debut in September: Jesse Jackson's syndicated talk show will 
premiere in Los Angeles on KCAL-TV Channel 9 next September, and the program's 
distributor has assured stations that the show will be delivered even if 
Jackson decides to run for mayor of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson "has given assurances" that he'll do the weekly, one-hour TV series, 
"Voices of America With Jesse Jackson," said Barry Stagg, a spokesman for 
Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. The series, co-produced by 
composer Quincy Jones, has been picked by 82 stations covering 60% of the 
national audience, Stagg said. SHAUNA SNOW

Donahue's Moore Interview Draws Crowds: More than 1,000 people lined up 
Wednesday morning in Flint, Mich., for tickets to Phil Donahue's Monday show, 
in which he will interview Michael Moore, maker of the General Motors Corp. 
documentary "Roger &amp; Me." The satirical documentary shows Moore trying 
unsuccessfully to interview GM Chairman Roger B. Smith on plant closings and 
layoffs in Flint. Police helped disperse a crowd of people who waited all night 
in hopes of seeing Donahue and Moore but were turned away when the 1,266 free 
tickets ran out. SHAUNA SNOW

BOB DOROUGH PLAYS A HIP SET AT THE VINE ST. BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Dorough might best be characterized as Dave Frishberg with an Arkansas 
twang. Actually Dorough, who opened Wednesday and will close Saturday at 
Hollywood's Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill, is several years Frishberg's senior, 
but a decade or two ago both men eased out of early roles as nightclub pianists 
into popularity as songwriters who performed their own hip material. 
</P>
<P>
Dorough and Frishberg, in fact, collaborated on the song "I'm Hip," with which 
Dorough closed his set Wednesday. (Frishberg, who wrote those mordant lyrics, 
will be at Vine Street next week). For the most part, Dorough's set matched his 
melodies with the stylish words of Fran Landesman. He proved his 
self-sufficiency as sole writer on, for example, "But for Now," which he 
introduced as "My hopelessly sentimental ballad." 
</P>
<P>
His thin, engaging voice is just what you might expect from this pony-tailed 
stringbean who, when not singing words, may indulge in scatting, humming, 
whistling, or simply playing very adept quasi-bop piano. Now and then he sings 
standing up, backed only by the efficient bass of Monty Budwig and the drums of 
Luis Peralta, whose Argentine background brings authenticity to the Latin 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For Henry Mancini, who was in the room, Dorough cooked up a hard swinging 
variation on "Moon River." A highlight of the set was "I Get the Neck of the 
Chicken," a 1942 Frank Loesser ditty, during which Jack Sheldon, seated in a 
booth, supplied an impeccable trumpet chorus. But with or without help from 
visiting hornmen, Dorough is the quintessential cabaret/jazz entertainer in a 
field that has produced very few genuine talents. LEONARD FEATHER

AL WILLIAMS QUINTET HEATS UP HIS LONG BEACH CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Williams, who has split his musical career between owning nightclubs and 
playing in them, led his five-man Jazz Society Band from behind the drums at 
his Long Beach nitery, Birdland West on Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Working before a small, but enthusiastically appreciative audience, Williams 
and company, who will work the room every Wednesday through February, provided 
an attractive opening set that was loose and swinging from top to bottom. Four 
tunes -- a pair of standards and a pair of less familiar classics -- gave the 
quintet ample solo room and provided a showcase for the band's well-thought 
ensemble passages. 
</P>
<P>
A front line of saxophonist Charles Owens and trumpeter Nolan Smith allowed for 
Blakeyesque melodic statements during three up-tempo swing tunes. An opening 
"One by One," a Wayne Shorter composition from his days with Art Blakey, showed 
the band's hard-bop bent, as well as providing an aural view of the contrasting 
solo styles of Owens and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, a long-established force on the Southland jazz scene, offered long, 
flowing lines within the syncopated context on the tenor sax. Smith, newer to 
the scene, offered shorter bursts of melody on both "One by One" and the 
closing "The Preacher," by Horace Silver. But on Blue Mitchell's "Fuji Mama" 
and the ballad, "Here's That Rainy Day," the trumpeter's style turned smooth 
and liquid with full-bodied, round tones that showed Smith a major contender. 
</P>
<P>
Also by contrast was Owens' work on the Mitchell tune. With a more jagged 
style, Owens traversed traditions, approaching some familiar quotes through 
brief forays into modality. 
</P>
<P>
Williams capably spurred the band throughout the set, displaying a solid sense 
of swing and showing deft artistry with brushes during the set's only ballad. 
Bassist Richard Reid, a powerhouse, authoritative player, was terrific in both 
solo and accompanying roles. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Bobby Pierce, while certainly adept at comping behind the soloists, 
showed more chops than musicality during his frequent solo outings. Notes flew 
furiously during his solos, giving the listener little opportunity to embrace 
any of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which will be appearing Wednesdays through February, communicated a 
great sense of fun during its hourlong opening set. The group's unbridled 
enthusiasm, in generally too short a supply on the local scene, was infectious.

"Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt" confronts us with the reality of AIDS 
with such simplicity and directness that it is hard to imagine how the enormous 
tragedy of this disease could be expressed with greater impact.

What film makers Jeffrey Friedman and Robert Epstein (who directed the 
Oscar-winning "The Times of Harvey Milk") have done is to interview five people 
who have lost loved ones to AIDS and to interweave their words with clips from 
TV news programs to chart both the relentless progress of the disease during 
the last decade and the inadequacy of the government's response to it. 
</P>
<P>
As narrator Dustin Hoffman calmly ticks off increasingly grim statistics, the 
film takes the full measure of homophobia in our society. Yet one of its key 
accomplishments is to make clear how foolish and dangerous it is to regard AIDS 
as "the gay disease." 
</P>
<P>
Tragedy has made everyone interviewed a figure of eloquence and candor. Sara 
Lewinstein speaks with humor and affection of the extraordinary relationship 
she had with Dr. Tom Waddell, a champion athlete who helped found the Gay Games 
in San Francisco. Although both were gay, they had a child. Soon after, Waddell 
was found to have AIDS. Sallie Perryman deeply loved her husband despite his 
drug addiction, which he struggled for years to overcome, only to succumb to 
AIDS. Another strong woman, Suzi Mandell, had to face the loss of her 
11-year-old son, a hemophiliac who contracted the disease through his need for 
massive blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Vito Russo ("The Celluloid Closet") speaks with anger of the loss of his 
lover, Jeffrey Sevcik, and of the time it takes for the FDA to test and release 
possible life-saving drugs. Navy Cmdr. Tracy Torrey speaks of marrying and 
raising a family before accepting his homosexuality, only to lose his lover, 
landscape architect David Campbell, to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey is clearly in the final stages of AIDS himself, and, as the film cuts 
from one interview subject to another, we realize that despite appearances of 
good health, many of them may either have AIDS or have tested HIV positive. 
Further disclosures make an already troubling film seem all the more 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
Linking these five people -- and giving them a measure of consolation -- is 
their participation in the AIDS Memorial Quilt. Indeed, Torrey's last act, 
before his own death from AIDS, was to make a panel for himself as well as one 
for Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"Common Threads," which has an understated score by Bobby McFerrin 
incorporating humming voices, culminates with the ceremonial unfolding of the 
vast quilt on the Mall in Washington. "Common Threads" (Times-rated Mature) 
thus leaves us with an image that is beautiful -- but also one that conveys 
heartbreakingly the overwhelming loss of human life. Proceeds from the film's 
open-end run Sundays at 11 a.m. at the Music Hall in Beverly Hills will benefit 
the NAMES Project Foundation, which raises funds and encourages support for 
people with AIDS and their loved ones.

ETHNIC EATING: ITA-CHO: SAKE TO QUAFF AND SEASONAL DISHES TO NIBBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ita-Cho is a small Japanese restaurant tucked into a mini-mall that could draw 
me back any time. The food is wonderful, the presentation beautiful and the 
mood as soothing as the misty mural of mountains, pines and temples mounted on 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Given its location, you might expect Ita-Cho to be nothing more than a 
neighborhood cafe dispensing homespun sukiyaki and tempura. Neither, however, 
is on the menu. Nor is this a sushi bar, although it looks like one, with chefs 
busily composing dishes behind a counter. According to the menu, Ita-Cho is a 
koryori-ya, a restaurant that specializes in fresh, seasonal fish and vegetable 
dishes. It is also a place where Japanese go to drink sake or beer and eat the 
food that goes best with these beverages. 
</P>
<P>
This could be grilled chicken wings (just the two-boned central joint, mounted 
on a skewer), fish dumplings wrapped with noodle-like strands of fragile dough 
and steamed, or jade-green rings of lettuce filled with chicken and arranged in 
the lightest imaginable broth. 
</P>
<P>
The dumplings -- wasu shumai -- are nothing like the open-ended, pork-stuffed 
shumai of Cantonese dim sum. And the chicken in lettuce is an exemplary blend 
of subtle flavor and lightness. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the foods reflect preferences that are distinctively Japanese, like 
strong tasting broiled whole smelt with crunchy roe, or fish liver, or thick, 
pinkish squid rings that at first looked as inviting as a pile of rubber bands. 
But the rings were remarkably tender and full of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Tori tatsuta age is Japanese-style fried chicken. The chicken nuggets are 
coated with cornstarch, deep-fried and served with mustard-flavored mayonnaise 
and a lemon wedge. Steamed Dungeness crab -- obligingly cut in half for a small 
order -- comes with a sprightly, vinegar-based dipping sauce. And steamed white 
fish, in a bowl of light broth with chrysanthemum leaves and Napa cabbage, 
could qualify as spa food; it's brightened by a lemony soy-sauce dip. 
</P>
<P>
Although most people recoil at the thought of fish bones, the spiny carcass is 
an essential component of Ita-Cho's fried flounder with lemon sauce. Separated 
from the fish and fried crisp, they are as crunchy and tender as chips. 
</P>
<P>
Ita-Cho is open only at night and remains open into the early-morning hours, as 
befits a beer and sake operation. There are several sakes to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are surprisingly modest. Two could share an assortment of these dishes 
for about $25. There is a nice dish of slim Oriental eggplant topped with 
minced shrimp in a delicate sauce for $4.50. The wasu shumai are $4, the tori 
tatsuta age is $3.50, and the Nagasaki-style braised pork and chicken wrapped 
in lettuce leaves are each $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Ita-Cho, 6775 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 871-0236. Open Monday 
through Saturday 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Parking available. MasterCard and Visa 
accepted.

Bogdan Perzynski is a Polish artist living in Austin, Tex. His work appears as 
a set of meditations on cultural stereotypes, global tensions, censorship and 
basic human urges. 
</P>
<P>
Smartly designed and clearly dry-humored, Perzynski's four installations are 
slow to yield their meanings. 
</P>
<P>
In "Skitseuphrenia," the word is spelled out phonetically on four pennants. 
Blowups of engravings of Isaac Newton and Nicolaus Copernicus rest on the floor 
next to a real tandem bicycle (presumably a symbol for the mental disorder). 
Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy, is turned on his head in a kind of 
literal one-upmanship (his notion of the universe didn't include Newton's law 
of gravitation). 
</P>
<P>
The point seems to be that major theories about the universe used to change 
slowly -- the two scientists lived centuries apart -- but we now live in an 
unsettling world of radical upheaval, particularly in the political sphere (the 
pennants -- signifying the "sport" of warring factions -- are blood-red). 
Nonetheless, the piece remains a kind of rebus in which each part stands for 
something but the separate parts don't enhance one's impression of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
In "Pleasure," dollar bills, dried leaves, tableware wrapped in red napkins, an 
animal silhouetted against a block of painted camouflage print and a trio of 
different dictionaries in glass cases seem to be calling attention to the 
conflicting interpretations that can be put on the notion of pleasure. One 
man's meat is another man's poison -- but it depends who is labeling the 
poison. A group of prints delves into the same themes by combining drawn and 
photographic imagery. (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Feb. 17.) CATHY

Moving from well-known scenes of Chicano life into the realm of baroque fantasy 
is a somewhat bumpy journey for John Valadez. But you have to admire the sheer 
courage and operatic vigor of recent pastels grouped under the title 
"Condenados" (The Damned). 
</P>
<P>
The better pieces retain some link with modern times and the artist's own style 
but use Old Master images as a flavorful seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
On a grand scale, the show's title work presents a vision of Spanish 
colonization and religious tyranny of the New World's native peoples. Dusky, 
fleshy nudes cower below a hulking figure with a sword, elaborate headdress and 
swollen blue tongue; tiny scenes of brutality and the subservient treatment of 
Indians by the Catholic clergy trail across the sky. Valadez's own voice seems 
to be smothered by the weight of art history in this piece as well as "Fall of 
Babel," a painting that apes Baroque models. 
</P>
<P>
Much fresher is the intimate image of "Mad Manny," a middle-aged man in deluxe 
surroundings who is stopped in mid-gesture by an angel painted in a wonderfully 
unreal lacy style (perhaps taken from an old engraving?). The conjunction of 
old and new, everyday and otherworldly makes a fine bouquet. (Saxon-Lee 
Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to Feb. 17.) CATHY CURTIS

CBS VAMPIRE MOVIE SQUEEZED BY THE SMALL SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Horror works well on television. There are the nightly newses. There are the 
tire commercials that threaten terrifying things. Or take "Hard Copy" or "A 
Current Affair." 
</P>
<P>
An exception is vampires. 
</P>
<P>
They don't seem to work well on the little screen, even on CBS, which has such 
a scarifying schedule of programs. (Sorry, cheap shot.) 
</P>
<P>
The proof of this matter is tonight's "Daughter of Darkness" movie at 9 p.m. on 
CBS (Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Cathy, a winsome Chicago girl (played winsomely by Mia Sara), decides after her 
mother's death to seek out her father in their native Romania. He had abandoned 
them 20 years ago. So, in the production by Harry Chandler and Gerald W. 
Abrams, as directed by Stuart Gordon from the script by Andrew Laskos, she sets 
out for Bucharest on this nightmarish mission. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Father is deader than his official death report -- and he turns out to be 
a vampire, as played by Tony Perkins with a thick-tongued and decidely gruesome 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
But he is a kindly vampire who tries to save her from a surly band of lively 
deadlies who swill plasma but prefer fresh blood. In that way they much 
resemble the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
There are some tricky twists and turns in the plot but it is seriously too 
silly. Vampires belong on the big screen, or behind the screen in our major 
Hollywood agencies; they don't work well on television, with its constant 
interruptions by commercials on the perils of buying the wrong tires. About as 
visceral a response as you can get is a yawn. IRV LETOFSKY

MOM, POP MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME AT ELENA'S 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great culinary treasures of any city is its neighborhood, family 
operated restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Not the crassly self-defined "family restaurants" that are cut from a corporate 
mold. I mean the mom-and-pop places usually created and operated by a husband 
and wife who, one hopes, enjoy spending virtually every hour of their lives 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Elena and Haroutioun Tchentchenian are one such team. They are ethnic Armenians 
from Athens who run Elena's Greek Armenian Restaurant in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
As you enter the small space that serves as the restaurant's vestibule, cash 
counter and kitchen, you might see Elena grilling lulu kebab (sausage-shaped 
rolls of spiced chopped beef) or tangy chicken shish kebab. 
</P>
<P>
Elena's is the sort of place that could put cooking at home out of business. 
Everything on the brief menu exudes the unself-conscious vitality of confident 
home cooking -- at prices difficult to compete with at home. 
</P>
<P>
None of the main dishes cost more than $8, and most are accompanied by a 
delicate rice pilaf and a simple but well-dressed salad or an excellent 
mint-and-lemon-perfumed lentil soup and a roasted green pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, if you can believe it, are deftly seasoned lamb chops (three of 
them!) and a plate of nine or so slender stuffed grape leaves, or dolma, with a 
spirited garlic yogurt sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the winner-take-all lamb chop, shish kebab and lulu kebab 
combination plate. A perfectly OK baked chicken was the only dish that didn't 
beckon me back for more. 
</P>
<P>
The drink and dessert lists are even more limited than the rest of the menu. 
Aside from the usual sodas, milk and tea, there is "yogurt milk," which is the 
salty Near Eastern yogurt drink tahn, and sectarian coffee -- in this case it's 
called Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent crunchy and relatively unsweet baklava -- the only dessert -- is a 
natural complement to the thick coffee. 
</P>
<P>
One day as the sound of raindrops beat down on the thin roof of the enclosed, 
Astroturf-carpeted patio, I sat at a table covered with a plastic, 
red-and-white checked cloth and felt as if I were in a coastal taverna on the 
island of Crete. 
</P>
<P>
My companion looked appreciatively around the patio -- at the plastic plants 
(about nine varieties) and plastic flowers (at least 13 different kinds), at 
the carpet sweeper leaning in one corner (the Astroturf is well-groomed) -- and 
said appreciatively, "I feel like Shirley Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
Well, if that film heroine were in Elena's Restaurant, she might well think 
that she was still on her racy escape to Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena's, 1000 S. Glendale Ave., Glendale. (818) 241-5730. Open from 11 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Monday through Saturday; closed Sunday. No alcohol, but you may bring 
your own beer or wine. Street parking. Cash only. Dinner for two, $14 to $20.

JAZZ: TURIYA'S 20-YEAR ODYSSEY LED FROM SOUTHERN BAPTIST ROOTS TO HER FLOWERING 
IN LATIN AND AFRO-CUBAN RHYTHMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her Dad is a conservative doctor and the family figured her for a career 
homemaker or church organist. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego jazz musician Turiya felt a different calling. A 20-year musical 
odyssey took her from avant-garde jazz in New York to Latin rhythms deep in the 
heart of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Turiya emerged playing exciting original music and reworked 
standards with her new Immediate Freedom Band, which appears tonight and 
Saturday at the RUSE Performance Gallery in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the band appeared at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. 
The atmosphere was almost spiritual. Dressed in white, Turiya looked small next 
to her long bass clarinet, which has a range and size similar to a tenor 
saxophone. She seemed oblivious to her audience, rocking back and forth with 
her eyes closed as the music unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
She traded searing solos with fluegelhorn player Bill Caballero and reed man 
Dave Millard. A three-man percussion session brewed up Latin and Afro-Cuban 
rhythms; other band members added vocal sounds, hand percussion, electric piano 
and bass. 
</P>
<P>
After years of developing her sounds, Turiya, 38, seems to have found a great 
band, which doubles as an ad hoc family. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty much getting my needs met," she said during a recent interview on 
the porch of her North Park bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
During her childhood in San Diego, that wasn't always true. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a Southern family. What I was supposed to do was play piano in 
the Southern Baptist church," said Turiya, who prefers to keep her family name 
a secret. "No one dreamed I would consider a performing career, unless it was 
as a church organist." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of her family played musical instruments and sang. She took 
piano lessons and eventually sensed that jazz might be her calling, though she 
hadn't really heard any. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through a period of searching. At 14, I put the piano music in the 
closet and said I was going to improvise and never look at music again. 
</P>
<P>
"I became interested in jazz. Someone gave me a Dave Brubeck record, and I 
said, 'That's almost it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then she met a self-styled philosopher and jazz music fanatic named Nelson 
Palleman who changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"He had thousands of records," she recalled. "He played me 'Om' by John 
Coltrane and 'Karma' by Pharoah Sanders and started me on a reading program. He 
gave me the equivalent of a B.A. in music." 
</P>
<P>
Palleman and his teaching became more important than (Monte Vista) high school, 
where she didn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
"I was into the Temptations, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, not the Beatles," 
she explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 18, she began studying jazz with local sax man Daniel Jackson and soon found 
the unusual instrument that remains her favorite, though she also plays flute 
and saxes. 
</P>
<P>
"With the bass clarinet, I had the strongest connection. It has a real bizarre 
fingering system. It's a real masochistic instrument. It takes a lot of wind. 
It's emotionally challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Two musical sojourns had a profound impact on her career. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to tiny ads in the back of the jazz magazine Downbeat, she went to New 
York in 1980 to spend a year at the Creative Music Studio, an avant-garde 
retreat that featured such guest artists as Jack de Johnette, Oliver Lake, 
Julius Hemphill, Anthony Braxton and the Art Ensemble of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like an ashram," she said. "The people who need to be there find it. We 
lived in an old campground. They taught us chanting, breathing, meditation. We 
were isolated on a mountain like monks. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned how to get inside our feelings. Jazz is an oral tradition. You 
can't learn from a book. It's passed on human to human. People would be in your 
face, critiquing your music, critiquing your life." 
</P>
<P>
A second musical adventure took her to Mexico, where she perfected her 
knowledge of Latin rhythms with percussionist and band leader Taumbu and his 
ensemble in Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a deep calling to Mexico," she said. "It's just another world, a 
beautiful world. Most Americans only see the border. Way down, it's exotic, 
there are birds and flowers and tropical forests and the people are great. Our 
materialistic, rushing values are not there. I felt Latin music was the way I 
wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
Back in San Diego in 1985, she formed a big Latin ensemble, naming it Future 
Primitive in honor of Palleman. 
</P>
<P>
"His philosophy was that primitive was better, that the future lay in a return 
to primitive values." 
</P>
<P>
But she needed to support her daughter, so for a few years she worked 
"casuals," hiring out as a pianist or band member for assorted private parties. 
Last June, she was ready to make original music again, and the Immediate 
Freedom Band was born. 
</P>
<P>
Reed man Millard and conga player Glen Lacy have known Turiya for years. They 
even went to Mexico with her. Generally, most of Turiya's band members have 
been friends for a long time. Their commitment to the music and warm feelings 
for one another come across. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview, pianist and composer Joe Garrison stopped by to test 
Turiya's piano as a tuner worked it over. Lacy arrived by bicycle, and he and 
Garrison left to look at a car one of them wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the band is actively trying to expand their growth and 
consciousness," she said. "They are terribly enthusiastic. They love to 
rehearse." 
</P>
<P>
On stage, the music seems to sustain her, but Turiya wouldn't mind some degree 
of commercial success. A recording contract would be a good start. 
</P>
<P>
"This band needs to be recorded," she said. "They deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Although she seems happy for the moment, San Diego isn't her favorite place. 
She may move to Mexico, at least part time, once her daughter graduates from 
high school in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real funny town," she said, citing its conservative attitudes toward 
the arts, and the poor treatment blacks and other minorities often receive. 
"It's hard to be around it, that kind of ignorance. And the border situation. 
This is Mexico. We live in Mexico. This is Indian land. People never stop to 
think about how other people feel. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is not to let yourself get eaten up by that."

Little of what Peter Zokosky paints is remarkable, and yet it is all 
remarkable. Familiarity breeds no contempt in his images of cows, plants, 
humans, clouds and sea creatures but instead evokes curiosity, wonder, respect. 
It's a matter of perception, the Long Beach painter suggests, a matter of 
looking at the surface of the world and beyond, and crediting both realities as 
equally true and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Zokosky, whose work is on view at the Felicita Foundation Gallery (247 S. 
Kalmia, Escondido), states the case fairly plainly in his painting, "Seeing 
Cows." Five of the bovine beasts, serene and self-content, stand in profile on 
a gently rolling green pasture. One of the cows is painted in a traditional, 
naturalistic style, a faithful representation of the animal's size, shape and 
surface as seen by the naked eye. Another, however, is a mere skeleton, and 
another an anatomical cross-section of muscles and bones. Another view forgoes 
the pattern of pelt to map the cow's digestive tract. The last exists only in 
outline, as a crude, bullet-shaped mass with straight-as-stick legs like those 
drawn by a child. 
</P>
<P>
However different these views, they all represent cows. Each definition is as 
valid as the next and they coexist, comfortably. This, perhaps, is the 
"Legitimate Paradox" referred to in the show's title. What we see casually, 
with unquestioning eyes, is coupled in Zokosky's paintings with visions of 
submerged realities, hidden systems and latent mysteries. The natural world 
assumes a fascinating, fluid identity when these ordinarily concealed facets 
are brought to the surface to mingle with more familiar aspects of the same 
subjects. By paying as much attention to the unseen as to the seen, Zokosky 
sharpens our awareness of the layered quality of life, the multiple readings 
possible of any subject or situation. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gardening," the artist exposes the botanical and biological processes at 
work while a couple tends to their back yard, thereby transforming the mundane 
suburban scene into a narrative rich with sexual symbolism. In the pair's 
well-kept garden, manicured shrubs stand in a neat row before a masonry brick 
wall and a sapling stands on the lawn with the help of a supporting stake. The 
woman waters the grass with a hose and the man stands across from her, pausing 
from his work with a hoe. 
</P>
<P>
The predictability of the scene dissipates in the details. Zokosky shifts the 
perspective beneath the couple's feet and renders the earth below in 
cross-section, revealing the fine, shallow roots of the grass, the deeper, more 
complex root system of the young tree, the numerous rocks embedded in the dirt 
and the worm channels winding through it. The woman's short skirt bears a 
pattern that seems abstract, but actually diagrams her reproductive system. Her 
pairing with the sinuous lines and nourishing function of the hose confirms her 
sexual role, as does her mate's prop of a straight, solid hoe. 
</P>
<P>
Zokosky turns the familiar inside out again in "Skeleton and Goat" and in the 
diptych, "Hare and Hare After." Each work shows two views of its subject, one 
an accurate rendering of the animal's texture and mass, the other of its 
skeletal or muscular system. In "One, Two, Three," Zokosky shows what the 
unaided eye can see, but cannot seize -- the individual movements that merge to 
form continuous motion. Here, a single gray dog is seen simultaneously at three 
different stages of a backward flip. Like the pioneering, stop-action 
photographs of Eadweard Muybridge, Zokosky's painting fragments a single 
action, allowing slow scrutiny of a split-second sight. 
</P>
<P>
While many of Zokosky's works give access to the visually inaccessible, others 
elevate the known to the status of the revered through an elegant painting 
style of rich color and radiant light, as in "Serpent" and "Gibbons in the 
Trees." The artist's unpopulated landscapes are far less mesmerizing. They lack 
both the punning humor and the odd, revelatory character of the animal 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentleman" is, perhaps, the oddest and most disturbing of all, for it 
introduces the notion that man is not only blind to much of the natural world, 
but also manipulative, patronizing and possessive of it. 
</P>
<P>
In this painting, a young woman sits at the base of a tree, as if engaged in a 
lesson with the gorilla seated opposite her on a small folding stool. She holds 
up a panel with a picture of a man; two other panels, depicting an antelope and 
an Oreo cookie, lay beside her on the jungle floor. 
</P>
<P>
This curious scene caricatures our insistence on relating to the non-human 
world in strictly human terms. The beauty and mystery so abundant in that 
world, and so well articulated in Zokosky's paintings, would seem to cast us 
better in the role of student than teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The show continues through March 3.

PREVIEW: A MULTIMEDIA EXHIBIT ON LIVING WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some are angry, some are hopeful, some are sad, and some are confused, but the 
voices -- all of them -- are strong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not normal to be in your early 40s and to have known so many people who 
have died," says one man with AIDS, who stopped counting after 20 of his 
friends had died from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a lot of power I never thought I had," says another man, who spent 
weeks in a coma while fighting AIDS. "I never got into that 'I feel sorry for 
myself' syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
The voices, compiled on a 40-minute tape, resonate in the Pierce College Art 
Gallery, where thoughts, photographs and possessions of people with AIDS are 
displayed in a multimedia exhibit titled "Living With AIDS -- A Collaborative 
Reflection." 
</P>
<P>
The show, which features the work of eight artists and is open through Feb. 8, 
provides a powerful yet unsentimental look at how the disease has affected 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics are important so you can get a grip on the scope of the epidemic, 
but there's the human side we need to deal with," said Kim Abeles, one of the 
show's coordinators. "We all need to deal with death and the way we treat 
people who are ill." 
</P>
<P>
Abeles built the show's centerpiece, a glass-topped table that displays 
personal effects of people with AIDS. The items, embedded in purple satin, 
include a miniature globe, a graduation cap, a wedding portrait, a Purple Heart 
and a rejection letter from the Social Security Administration for Supplemental 
Security Income. 
</P>
<P>
The table is surrounded by six different chairs, all painted purple and 
surfaced with felt, where viewers are encouraged to sit. Hovering above is a 
purple chiffon chair with a metal frame. The floating chair, Abeles said, 
represents the soul. "It's some sort of space between living and dying," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Out of speakers on the ceiling, come the voices of people with AIDs. The 
interviews chronicle, with humor and anger, their first moments after being 
diagnosed, their thoughts about death and the reactions of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"People think of AIDS as victimization -- the idea that these people are 
helpless -- but a lot them lead fairly normal lives," Abeles said. 
</P>
<P>
Many don't, however, and the exhibit also reveals the disgust and terror of 
those stricken in the prime of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
One is a woman named Delta, who is photographed in a room full of stuffed 
animals sitting on a pull-out sofa bed between her two young daughters. The 
woman, about 35 years old, looks furious. "How can this be happening to me?" 
she seems to be saying. "I still have a lot left to do." 
</P>
<P>
Two sets of self-portraits by men with AIDS also express sadness and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
In a photo titled "Torn Apart and Isolated," Wade Phillip Wenthur appears in 
four overlapping exposures, but much of his head is cropped off. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, I felt the need to tell my friend of my illness," Wenthur 
says, in a statement accompanying his photos. "On the other hand, I faced the 
prospect of rejection." 
</P>
<P>
While primarily chronicling the human side of AIDS, the show also explores the 
politics of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
A slide show expresses what one artist considers the media's depersonalization 
of AIDS, with images such as newspaper headlines, Ronald Reagan and a mournful 
Latino family set against the American flag. The slide show is accompanied by 
mirrors on surrounding walls "so the viewer can interact" with the piece, 
Abeles said. 
</P>
<P>
Political commentary also is offered in a series of photographs called "Street 
Graphic Interventions." The photos document the clandestine campaign of an 
activist group that stuck small posters throughout New York's subway system, 
instructing people how to use condoms and clean drug paraphernalia. The posters 
were removed the next day by New York authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the posters gives step-by-step instructions on how to clean a needle. It 
appears among bacon and eggs, fried chicken and an ice cream sandwich on an ad 
for Andrew's Coffee Shops. "Put A Smile In Your Coffee Break," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living With AIDS -- A Collaborative Reflection" will be on display through 
Feb. 8. The gallery is open noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 6 to 8:30 
p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, and 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Thursday. For information, 
call (818) 347-0551.

CONTRAS PLOTTING TO ASSASSINATE ORTEGA, NICARAGUA CHARGES

Nicaragua has told the United States that it intercepted messages between 
U.S.-backed Contras last Sunday that referred to a plan to assassinate 
President Daniel Ortega in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
In a protest to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, also circulated as a 
U.N. document, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said that the 
messages were transmitted over U.S.-supplied equipment. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of trying to disrupt elections in Nicaragua set for Feb. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated Jan. 22, said that military intelligence deciphered messages 
sent between Contra troops in which they mentioned a plan to assassinate Ortega 
in an ambush to be set up between the towns of Quilali and San Juan del Rio 
Coco. 
</P>
<P>
D'Escoto said the messages were sent "by means of sophisticated equipment 
supplied by the government of the United States as part of the misnamed 
'humanitarian aid.' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has not yet commented on D'Escoto's protest, has continued 
providing the Nicaraguan rebels with non-lethal assistance.

CHANGE ON DIAMOND BILL WASN'T TIED TO DONATION, DYMALLY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) acknowledged Thursday that he altered his 
support for sanctions against South Africa diamonds after meeting with a 
diamond importer who later gave $34,200 to an educational foundation at the 
suggestion of a Dymally aide. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, however, vehemently denied that he changed his position in response to 
a request from the diamond merchant, Maurice Tempelsman, or that he was even 
aware of the contribution, which was earmarked for a scholarship fund bearing 
the congressman's name. 
</P>
<P>
While he later received a $2,000 speaking fee from the foundation, Dymally said 
in an interview, he donated the same amount to the scholarship fund for high 
school students in his congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody influences Dymally with any contribution, and I don't (care) how much 
money he has," Dymally said. 
</P>
<P>
Tempelsman, chairman of Lazare Kaplan International of New York, said in a 
written statement that he met Dymally on April 19, 1988, and expressed his fear 
that a law barring South African diamond imports would be impossible to enforce 
because diamonds from many countries are commingled by suppliers and later 
cannot be distinguished from each other. Tempelsman said Dymally asked his firm 
to draft a proposed amendment in sanctions legislation. 
</P>
<P>
As a buyer of uncut South African diamonds, the firm could have been crippled 
by strong sanctions, Tempelsman said. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment authorizing a study on distinguishing South African diamonds from 
gems mined elsewhere was offered on Dymally's behalf and approved the next day 
by a House subcommittee. The bill was approved by the House but died when the 
Senate failed to act on it that year. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, however, said he introduced the amendment at the request of Botswana, 
a major diamond-producing country, and of black groups that felt that the 
original broad language on diamond imports might have the effect of killing the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a report in the Washington Post that Lazare Kaplan's Washington 
lobbyist, Howard Marlowe, provided the draft amendment to his office, Dymally 
replied: "I don't recall details of those meetings. . . . I don't recall 
getting any language or anything like that. The staff handled it."

The San Diego Symphony received a $2.5-million gift from an anonymous 
benefactor. Symphonyofficials said the donation, coupled with the forgiveness 
of almost $2 million in bank loans, allows the orchestra to retire its 
$4.4-million capital deficit, the last remnant of the debt incurred in the 
purchase of Symphony Hall in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In forgiving the debt, a consortium of banks headed by Bank of America required 
that the symphony retain ownership of the auditorium for 10 years. The symphony 
acquired the former Fox Theater in 1984, spending more than $6 million for the 
purchase and renovation. It began performing there in November, 1985. In the 
meantime, the organization was accumulating a multimillion-dollar operating 
deficit, which resulted in the cancellation of the 1986-87 season. A 
scaled-down orchestra returned to the stage with a shorter season in the fall 
of 1987.

<P>
The state Senate unanimously passed a legislative ethics reform package, 
including a ban on honorariums and gifts valued at more than $250 from special 
interests and strengthening of prohibitions against conflict of interest. The 
proposal is linked to voter enactment in June of a separate ballot proposition 
approved by the Legislature last year that would create a new state agency to 
set lawmaker salaries. The package sailed out of the Senate to the Assembly, 
which is expected to act next week on a similar ethics program.

SILENT SCREEN ACTRESS MADGE BELLAMY, 89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silent screen heroine Madge Bellamy, who had lead roles in the 1920s epics 
"Lorna Doone" and "The Iron Horse," died Wednesday at San Antonio Community 
Hospital in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bellamy, 89, had been hospitalized since Jan. 10 for chronic cardiac 
problems. One of the last remaining stars of the silent era, she had lived 
quietly in Riverside and San Bernardino counties for several decades after her 
film career took a plunge with the advent of the talkies in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Born Margaret Philpott on June 30, 1900, in Hillsboro, Tex., Miss Bellamy made 
her stage debut at age 5 and began studying serious acting a decade later, 
appearing in several New York theatrical productions as well as the road show 
of "Pollyanna." 
</P>
<P>
The brown-eyed actress made her film debut in 1920 in the screen adaptation of 
the play, "The Riddle Woman," and had featured roles in 40 silent films. 
</P>
<P>
In the John Ford classic, "The Iron Horse," Miss Bellamy portrayed the daughter 
of the first transcontinental railroad's chief contractor. She fell in love 
with the film's male lead, George O'Brien, as the eastbound and westbound 
sections of the track were being joined. As "Lorna Doone," Miss Bellamy 
projected a sweet innocence as the aristocratic girl captured and raised by 
bandits before being swept away by the dashing hero, played by John Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bellamy was named "American Beauty" by the Hollywood Assn. of Foreign 
Correspondents in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
She went on to have roles in 10 talking pictures, including "White Zombie," a 
seminal 1932 horror film in which she starred opposite Bela Lugosi, fresh from 
his success in "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
After her early Hollywood successes, however, Miss Bellamy attracted far more 
attention for her tempestuous love life than for her oft-praised acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
Her love affairs first drew headlines in 1928, when she and Los Angeles bond 
broker Logan Metcalf slipped away to Tijuana to be wed. Within four days, they 
had separated and Metcalf filed for a divorce. "She was the sweetest thing in 
the world while I was courting her," Metcalf told a judge. ". . . (But) at our 
first meal after the wedding she started being temperamental." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, she was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after firing three 
shots at a boyfriend who jilted her for a model. In testimony, Miss Bellamy 
claimed that the wealthy lumber company executive had called her his "little 
Easter egg" and promised to marry her. The actress, who added that she was only 
"trying to scare the gizzard out of him," received a six-month suspended 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Settling in Ontario in her later years, the feisty actress remained a witty 
conversationalist but in a somewhat solitary life style, acquaintances said. 
She left no known survivors.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER, DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles man pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony manslaughter and 
drunk-driving charges for allegedly driving his car into a woman and six 
children on a sidewalk, killing a 7-year-old boy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Martinez was charged with one count each of vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated, hit-and-run, drunk driving and driving with a blood-alcohol 
content of .08 or more. Bail was set at $20,000, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol investigators had said they originally hoped to seek 
a murder charge against the driver, who also uses the name Jorge Louis 
Martinez, 21. CHP Officer Rich Richards said the investigation was continuing 
and additional charges may be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Hernandez, 7, was killed and his mother, Petra Hernandez, 33, and five 
other children were injured when they were struck by a car while walking along 
East 65th Street in the unincorporated Florence area Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, numerous callers sought to donate money to the Hernandez family 
after a report was published that the boy's father told a nun he feared that 
Pedro would be cremated because they were too poor to pay for a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Miramonte Elementary School, where Pedro was a second-grader, 
decided Thursday to establish a fund for the Hernandez family. So far, 
Assistant Principal Michael Repp said, they have received more than a dozen 
calls from people pledging money. 
</P>
<P>
Repp said anyone interested in contributing to the fund should make a check 
payable to the Miramonte Student Body Fund and mail it to the school at 1400 E. 
68th St., Los Angeles, 90001. People seeking more information can contact the 
school at (213) 583-1257. 
</P>
<P>
John Moeller of Norwalk said he called The Times seeking to contribute money to 
the family because he had just lost people who were "very dear to me. . . . 
Funerals are very important for the living. You want your children in a nice 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Petra Hernandez said Thursday that she was "very grateful" for the offers of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Rosary for the boy will be recited at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Presentation Catholic 
Church in the Florence area. Funeral Mass at the church will be at 9 a.m. 
Thursday, with burial at Resurrection Cemetery in South San Gabriel.

COALITION CAMPAIGNS FOR $750-MILLION PARKS BOND MEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: L.A. COUNTY OFFICIALS WORRY THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD TURN VOTERS 
AGAINST BOND MEASURES FOR JAILS AND HOSPITALS.

<P>
In a sunny office overlooking the Malibu coast, a serious-faced young woman 
named Esther Feldman is quietly helping hatch a political game plan she hopes 
will result in Los Angeles County voters passing what is apparently the biggest 
bond measure in county history. 
</P>
<P>
For up to 14 hours a day, Feldman, 28, confers with environmentalists and city 
managers, businessmen and labor activists, earnestly pitching the need for $750 
million in bonds to improve beaches, parks, wildlife habitats and museums as a 
tonic for the woes of urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
"This county is so appallingly behind in terms of providing adequate park and 
recreation and open-space opportunities for its residents," she said, sitting 
in her office high on a Malibu ridgetop, the gleaming Pacific beyond the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster this county grows -- and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down 
-- the more extreme the needs get," said Feldman, who is public outreach 
director for the Malibu-based Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, 
a state and local government agency that provides recreation and ranger 
services for parks in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we act now, we aren't going to have a chance to act," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But some county officials have raised questions about the massive park bond 
measure, which promoters are trying to persuade county supervisors to place on 
the November ballot. Officials are concerned that the bonds may drive the 
county's debt too high and jeopardize the chances for passage of other bond 
measures on the same ballot, including those for hospitals and jails. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the bond revenue would be split among the county's 86 
cities and county-maintained beaches, museums, botanical gardens and the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, which buys parklands in the mountains surrounding 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy would receive $120 million, which could be used to buy more 
land in the Santa Monicas, as well as help complete the proposed "Rim of the 
Valley" trail system, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Another $120 million would be earmarked for the cities, with the money parceled 
out on a per-capita basis. Los Angeles, with 3.4 million people, would get 
nearly $53 million, for example, while tiny Hidden Hills, with just 1,950 
residents, would draw $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, $50 million would be set aside for county beaches and $40 million 
to preserve historic structures, construct hiking and biking trails and plant 
trees in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Segal, a spokesman for County Chief Administrator Richard Dixon, said the 
measure would be the largest general obligation bond issue in county history 
"to the best of my knowledge." The next largest was a $225-million flood 
control issue in the late 1950s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The general obligation bonds would be secured by county property tax revenue 
and paid off over about 20 years. According to Feldman, they would cost the 
average property taxpayer an extra $27 in the first year and about half that in 
successive years. 
</P>
<P>
To promote the bonds, Feldman and other organizers are fashioning an 
odd-bedfellows coalition whose members range from Sierra Club members to 
inner-city activists who believe the bonds promise relief for urban parks 
overrun by gangs and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Another leader in the bond campaign, Lynn Alvarez, said the bonds could ease 
conflict in many heavily Latino neighborhoods over what sports can be played in 
parks. Although most parks are now set up only for softball and baseball, bond 
revenue could be used to build soccer fields, making them more attractive to 
Latinos, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, an immigration lawyer who heads a group called People for Parks, said 
the measure could help revive the 200 "dead parks" -- rundown parks that have 
essentially been taken over by gangs and drug dealers -- throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Bond backers launched their campaign about a year ago after commissioning a 
$15,000 opinion poll to test voter support for the measure. The poll, paid for 
with public funds by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and two smaller 
park agencies, found that 76% of the county's registered voters would vote for 
the bonds, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said strategists 
originally intended to include Ventura County in the measure but dropped the 
idea, fearing conservative Ventura voters would oppose it, lessening the chance 
it would win the necessary two-thirds majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the day-to-day organizing of the bond campaign is being done by 
Feldman, a one-time UC extension agriculture teacher who served as assistant 
campaign manager for Proposition 70, a statewide park bond issue that was 
approved by voters in 1988 and raised $776 million. 
</P>
<P>
She and other supporters have contacted scores of city officials, surveying 
them to find out what park projects need funding. More recently, promoters have 
been contacting county supervisors, whom they want to place the bonds on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Unless more funds are made available to local government soon, Feldman said, 
skyrocketing land costs may make it impossible to acquire sufficient park and 
recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said that despite the success of Proposition 70 and other statewide 
bond issues, Los Angeles County -- with about one-third of California's 
population -- traditionally has been shortchanged on revenue it receives. For 
instance, of the $776 million generated by Proposition 70, the county received 
only $120 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dixon has questioned the bond issue and at least one supervisor -- Peter 
Schabarum -- opposes it. Supervisors Kenneth Hahn and Ed Edelman support the 
measure, while Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana are undecided, their 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to supervisors Aug. 22, Dixon said the measure's presence on the 
November ballot would "cause it to compete with other issues critical" to the 
county. He cited a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for county jail 
construction and operation. Antonovich and Dana have similar concerns, 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also pointed out that park bond proceeds could be used only to buy or 
build new facilities, not to maintain existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that we cannot afford to adequately operate various recreational 
facilities we already have, it makes little sense to significantly expand 
development further beyond that point which we cannot already afford to 
maintain," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a later memo, Dixon said he still was considering whether the 
county should support the bonds, which he noted were backed by a "broad-based, 
well-organized effort which appears to be gaining support." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said there is no evidence that voters reject bond issues simply because 
other bond measures are on the same ballot. In 1988, voters statewide rejected 
just one of 14 bond measures on the ballot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that general obligation bonds can be spent only to build new 
projects, but argued that replacing old, worn-out facilities that are costly to 
keep up would reduce overall maintenance costs over time. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Schabarum said he opposes the park bond measure because it is 
only one of five property- or sales-tax increases that are under discussion and 
may wind up on the county ballot. The supervisor said that besides raising 
property taxes, he was very concerned about increasing the county's bond debts. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman responded that the county is in good financial health and can easily 
afford the park bonds. She said annual debt payments are 1.89% of the county 
budget, well below the 5% limit recommended by Standard and Poor's, a 
nationwide credit-rating agency.

12 MORE RESEDA, NORTHRIDGE FIRES RAISE TOTAL TO 75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Twelve more fires in the Reseda-Northridge area bring to at least 75 the number 
of fires set by arsonists in the area since late October, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One admitted arsonist is in custody, but investigators are looking for one or 
more others. 
</P>
<P>
The latest fires broke out in the general vicinity of Reseda Boulevard north of 
Saticoy Street between 6:30 p.m. and midnight Wednesday, Fire Inspector Ed Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In each instance, either a palm tree or a pile of rubbish was deliberately set 
afire, Reed said. One of the palm fires spread to the roof of a nearby home but 
caused only minor damage, he said. Another was set on the grounds of the 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The fires all appear to be linked," said Reed, who declined to describe how 
the fires were started. 
</P>
<P>
The latest fires appear to be linked to a rash of similar fires that have been 
breaking out in the same general vicinity since at least Halloween night, Reed 
added. A review of fire calls in the area shows at least 75 fires in the 
general Reseda Boulevard corridor that fit the pattern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, arson investigators arrested a 16-year-old Reseda boy who 
admitted that he started six of the fires, Reed said. But the boy denied 
responsibility for any others and was in custody in Sylmar Juvenile Hall when 
the last 16 fires were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who had a history of minor vandalism and theft in the area, was 
arrested after he was identified by a witness at one of the fires. Officials 
described him as a good student who is emotionally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
There was no clear motive for setting the fires. "These fires were part of his 
disturbance," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said investigators may be looking for several arsonists, who may or may 
not know each other. "We have had two or more people doing it," and because of 
similarities in the fires, at least one may be a copy-cat arsonist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department asked residents to be alert for arsonists after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the help of the public to catch this guy," Reed said. "We need people 
to keep their eyes open."

WIFE ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF MILLIONAIRE

<P>
A Tarzana woman who said she shot her millionaire husband to death because she 
thought he was a burglar was arrested on suspicion of murder, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Evelyn Mellinger, 48, was arrested after the shooting Wednesday in the 
19700 block of Komar Drive, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of her husband, Brainerd Lee Mellinger, 69, was found at 8 p.m. in the 
house in the exclusive area of Tarzana, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the victim as a multimillionaire who owned Mellinger Co., an 
import-export business in Woodland Hills, who appeared in cable-television 
advertisements on establishing import-export businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said Brainerd Mellinger was shot several times in the chest shortly 
after he came home from an undisclosed outing. After the shooting, Carole 
Mellinger telephoned a relative who lives elsewhere, and the relative called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived, Mellinger was dead. His wife said she had shot him 
because she mistook him for a burglar, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
But inconsistencies in her statements and evidence at the shooting scene led 
detectives to arrest Carole Mellinger, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were alone in the house at the time of the shooting and neighbors 
interviewed by police did not report hearing any disturbance, Lt. William Gaida 
said. There was no sign of forced entry to the house, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Mellinger had been drinking before the shooting and the couple, who had 
been married 23 years, apparently had an ongoing marital problem, police said. 
It was unknown if that was the motive for the slaying, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was being held without bail at the Van Nuys jail. Detectives were 
expected to ask the district attorney's office to charge her with murder today.

FLORES TO NAME NEW PLANNING PANEL FOR DOWNTOWN GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
SAN PEDRO: THE COUNCILWOMAN ALSO ANNOUNCES THAT UNOCAL WILL DONATE $300,000 TO 
HELP BUILD A BASEBALL COMPLEX ON CITY LAND. 
</P>

<P>
Declaring that San Pedro has "a firm foundation and one that we are going to 
build on," Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores announced Thursday that 
she will form a new citizens committee to draft a plan for growth in the 
downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
But the big hit of her annual speech to business and community leaders was the 
news that Unocal will contribute $300,000 to a private effort to build a 
baseball complex on surplus city land near the company's refinery. The 
announcement brought a round of applause from the crowd at Nizetich's 
restaurant, where Flores delivered her talk over a breakfast of eggs and ham. 
</P>
<P>
A Unocal spokesman said the donation will finance one stadium with a 
regulation-size field in the $1.2-million complex, which backers hope will 
include five playing fields for harbor-area youths. The councilwoman said: 
"This is really a boost in the arm; $300,000 is a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the creation of a new citizens panel to draft a "downtown 
specific plan" for the business district, Flores is making good on a promise 
she first made in last year's State of the City address. At that time, she 
pledged to establish two new citizens committees -- one to study ways of 
controlling growth in residential areas, and one to look specifically at 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said Thursday that she wanted to wait until the first committee had 
completed work on an interim control ordinance before appointing the second 
panel. The interim control ordinance, which will curb apartment and condominium 
development while permanent zoning changes are being reviewed, was adopted by 
the City Council in December. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to baseball and downtown development, Flores' talk Thursday touched 
on a wide range of local issues: tourism, parking, crime prevention, and the 
relationship between the community and the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On the latter topic, she touted a proposal she introduced to the City Council 
last week as part of an ethics-reform package. Her plan would give council 
members greater control over independent city commissions, such as the Los 
Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners, by making their decisions appealable to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Port spokeswoman Julia Nagano declined comment on the proposal, referring 
questions to the commissioners. But Commissioner Robert Rados and commission 
secretary Peter Mandia, both of whom attended the councilwoman's breakfast talk 
Thursday, also had little to say. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," Rados said. But he added, "That's been kicked over many times. 
Pete, do you have anything to say about this?" 
</P>
<P>
"There's some value in it," Mandia replied. Asked what value he saw, he 
replied: "Really, we've got to look at it. We just got it yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Flores believes the plan will go over well with harbor-area citizens who are 
frustrated by the port's lack of accountability to elected officials. For 
example, Flores spokeswoman Karen Constine pointed to a controversy last year 
over the port's decision to buy a coal bulk loader from the Port of Portland. 
Flores, along with a handful of community activists, questioned the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored 
Thursday's breakfast, specifically asked Flores to address the issue of city 
control over the port in her speech. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's sold-out breakfast -- 225 people attended and 35 people were on a 
waiting list this year -- is traditionally a time for Flores to review her 
accomplishments of the past year before a generally receptive crowd. After 
Thursday's talk, a receiving line of well-wishers formed around the 
councilwoman. Many kissed her on the cheek and congratulated her on a job 
well-done. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a time for those who want to get to know Flores to introduce 
themselves to her; one man, an architect, left a business card and told Flores 
that if the city could use his assistance, she could give him a call. 
</P>
<P>
During the councilwoman's speech, the crowd showed the most enthusiasm for the 
so-called "field of dreams" plan -- a reference to last summer's hit movie 
about baseball -- in which board members of the Eastview Little League founded 
a separate, nonprofit corporation to raise money to build the five fields. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said Thursday that she identified 15 acres of surplus city land for the 
group, called San Pedro Baseball Inc., and that the organization is now leasing 
the property on North Gaffey Street for $1 a year for 15 years. According to 
Constine, the group hopes to complete construction of at least one field by 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The group is planning one tee-ball field for young children, two Little League 
fields and two stadiums that can be used by high school and college students. 
The complex will be named after the councilwoman, who recently hosted a dinner 
with Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda in an effort to raise money for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the topic of sports, Flores said she will join with the San Pedro Youth 
Coalition in creating a special task force to survey recreation facilities in 
the harbor area and to suggest what might be needed in the future. The 
coalition has long complained that there are not enough playing fields for 
harbor-area children.

800 GATHER IN PROTEST OF YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 800 people filled the auditorium of Birmingham High School in Van 
Nuys Thursday night in the largest parent protest to date against proposals for 
sweeping changes in the school calendar and class sizes, including a 12-month 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called by West Valley school board member Julie Korenstein, who 
for more than two hours fielded questions from parents worried about hot summer 
classrooms and disruption of family vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Warner, who said he has seven children in public schools, accused the Los 
Angeles Unified School District of failing to plan properly for the soaring 
enrollment that prompted the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein replied that the district had a similar plan two years ago to 
convert all schools to year-round schedules. But, she said, "People spoke 
against it, I listened to what they had to say, and I voted against 
year-round." 
</P>
<P>
But the classroom shortage has grown worse since then, giving the board fewer 
options beside the conversion to year-round schedules, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Fiedler, former congresswoman and ex-school board member, disagreed. She 
told the audience that the district has about as many students as it did in the 
late 1970s when she was first elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed with existing facilities" then without converting to a 12-month 
school year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents applauded Lyle Spiegel, who said the Los Angeles district had grown too 
large to operate efficiently. "Divide it up and we can have our own Valley 
district," said Spiegel, who said he has two children at Welby Way Elementary 
School in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
It was at least the third meeting for parents in the west San Fernando Valley 
that has turned into a rally against the year-round plan. Opposition to the 
plan is centered in the Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials have said the district -- the nation's second 
largest -- will run out of elementary classroom seats by summer because of 
enrollment growth that is expected to continue through the 1990s. Seats at the 
district's junior high schools will be filled by 1993, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to increase the number of available seats at elementary schools by 23% 
was presented to the seven-member school board in December. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, schools would have to choose either larger class sizes or 
year-round and double-session schedules. District officials hope the plan would 
make room for an additional 60,000 students expected to enroll by fall, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is expected to decide on the proposal at its Feb. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this summer, 108 elementary schools that have reached capacity or 
receive students from filled schools would be required to change from the 
traditional school year calendar under the district's proposal. Forty-five of 
those schools are in the San Fernando Valley, which now has 15 schools on a 
year-round calendar. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, enrollment in the Los Angeles school district went up by 15,000 
students, pushing the district's total enrollment past 610,000. Even larger 
increases are expected in coming years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the district's closed schools, which would provide about 8,000 
seats, and new school construction, which is expected to add another 2,800 
seats by 1991, are not enough to accommodate the district's growing enrollment, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the district's recent growth has been in the Valley, district officials 
said. In addition to soaring enrollment by Valley residents, another 23,000 
students are bused from filled schools in other parts of the city. That number 
is expected to triple by 1993, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents with children in Valley schools who oppose the changes say that the 
district should first install air-conditioning in all of its classrooms before 
converting schools to year-round schedules. District officials estimate that it 
costs about $27,000 to air-condition each classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents from Dearborn Street Elementary School began circulating petitions 
this week that pledge signers to keep their children home if they are required 
to attend school if forecasts call for temperatures of more than 90 degrees or 
if the air is judged unhealthful by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions will be presented to the school board next week, Dearborn parent 
Rita Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Other parents from Sherman Oaks Elementary School say they are planning a 
demonstration at their campus on Wednesday to protest the possible change to 
year-round schedules.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD CHILD MOLESTER SENTENCED TO 23 YEARS 
IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 50-year-old North Hollywood man was sentenced Thursday to 23 years in prison 
after he pleaded guilty in San Fernando Superior Court to four counts of lewd 
conduct with children. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Kurtz, who has three prior child molestation convictions, was originally 
charged with 12 counts of lewd conduct for performing sex acts with two 
Antelope Valley boys, ages 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
If he had been convicted on all counts, he could have been sentenced to more 
than 45 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Payne III said he offered Kurtz a plea bargain so 
the victims, who are cousins, would not have to testify in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz was a friend of the boys' parents. He invited the children to sleep over 
at his house where he then forced them to perform sex acts and take 
pornographic pictures, Payne said. The encounters took place on several 
occasions between September, 1988, and January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies searching Kurtz's apartment found four photo albums filled 
with photos of Kurtz on vacations with young boys. They also found 68 pictures 
of Kurtz engaged in lewd conduct with the two boys and with many other 
children, Payne said. Most of the other children have never been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz could be eligible for parole in 10 years, Payne said. After his prior 
child molestation convictions, Kurtz spent time in mental hospitals, according 
to court records.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT DENIES APPEAL OF BRUTALITY RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has denied an appeal by the city of Glendale, 
letting stand an earlier federal court verdict awarding a Canoga Park man 
$60,000 in a police brutality case. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved Paul Valles, who brought action against the city, several 
police officers and jailers. 
</P>
<P>
Valles alleged that in November, 1986, Glendale police officers arrested him 
illegally, used excessive force and were indifferent to his medical needs in a 
one-night stay in jail. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the officers contended 
that Valles had been drunk in a public place and resisted arrest. They tried to 
introduce as evidence Valles' prior lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police 
Department and statements he made during a previous arrest as proof that he was 
biased against police in general. 
</P>
<P>
The judge excluded this evidence, and the jury ruled in Valles' favor. The 
decision, filed Tuesday, also awards the legal firm representing the plaintiff 
$71,000 in attorney fees, said Valles' lawyer, Stephen Yagman.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT TO DEATH IN N. HOLLYWOOD AMBUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man was shot to death ambush-style as he pulled out of his 
driveway Thursday, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Noguera, 37, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 6:45 a.m. 
slaying in the 11600 block of Hamlin Street, Lt. Charles Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
Noguera, described by police as a day laborer, was in his pickup when one or 
two Latino men approached the truck and shot him several times, Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
The men may have fled in a blue car, Massey said. Authorities had not 
determined a motive for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not appear to be gang-related," Massey said. "This man was 37 years 
old. He was not a gang person."

ROLLING HILLS WEIGHS RENTALS TO MEET FAIR-HOUSING LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council is considering permitting the construction of a 
total of nine rental units on private property in order to comply with state 
fair-housing policies requiring cities to encourage low- and moderate-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The city, an exclusive, gated residential community where houses on one- and 
two-acre lots sell for between $2 million and $3 million, finds itself in a 
difficult situation, said Mayor Ginny Leeuwenberg in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, Rolling Hills laws forbid rental units. 
</P>
<P>
A revision and update of the city's General Plan, begun last year, has shown 
the need to change the housing element of the plan to comply with state law. 
The change, as proposed by Cotton/Beland Associates of Pasadena with which the 
city contracted to work on the plan, calls for an adjustment in city laws 
allowing the construction and rental of nine units that would be rented at 
"affordable" rates that meet state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder just how we can provide low- and moderate-income housing in our city 
or for that matter anywhere on the hill," Councilwoman Jody Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which the council expects to approve after a public hearing at its 
next meeting on Monday,would allow the units to be built on private residential 
property -- one unit per property. Individual property owners would decide 
whether or not to build a rental unit on their land. The precise terms of 
rental agreements, the size of the unit and who would qualify to rent the units 
are yet to be determined by ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Terrence Belanger told the council that it is the city's 
responsibility to find ways to encourage low- and moderate-income housing, but 
it's "up to the private sector to determine if we're really going to meet the 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thorny, difficult problem," Leeuwenberg said in the interview. "This is 
not a problem that is going to be easily solved. If we pass an ordinance, 
there's no guarantee" that anyone is going to build a rental unit.

RAUCOUS PARTIES IN ROLLING HILLS MAY NET HOSTS A BILL FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ann Johnson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council has introduced an ordinance that will require 
the hosts of rowdy parties to pay for sheriff's deputies called to break up the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the sheriff's deputy called to a raucous party will tell 
the hosts that if additional deputies are required to break up the party, there 
will be a price to pay. The deputy will issue a written notice, outlining the 
ordinance and including a cost breakdown for additional police services. 
Party-givers who break up the party themselves after receiving the warning will 
not be charged. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously agreed to introduce the ordinance Monday after noting 
that eight to 10 such parties per year can make a dent in city funds. City 
Manager Terrence Belanger said Thursday that the city does not know exactly how 
much those services have cost, but the amount is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is passed as expected in two weeks, it would become effective 
March 6. It would include a fee scale for the cost of additional deputies 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dennis Gillard of the Lomita sheriff's station said the cost of 
dispersing a party depends on the type of police service required. He was 
unable to give a breakdown of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
Belanger told the council that the large parties typically occur around 
graduation, during the summer, at Christmastime and during spring break. They 
are usually given by young adults who invite large numbers of people and a lot 
of trouble, he said. "Those are the kind of parties that we're really talking 
about," he said. "People coming from outside the area who have no respect for 
the property or the community." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gordana Swanson said the ordinance is a way of holding parents 
responsible for the actions of their children when the parents are out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Several other cities, including neighboring Palos Verdes Estates, enforce 
similar ordinances. Gillard said Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates 
are also considering establishing a party ordinance. Ann Johnson

WEEKENDER: SCOTTISH DANCE SOCIETY PLANS A REEL PARTY FOR 231ST BIRTHDAY OF POET 
ROBERT BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris What: Robert Burns Supper. When: Saturday, 5:30 p.m. Where: 
Hyatt Edgewater Hotel Empire Ballroom, 6400 E. Pacific Coast Hwy., Long Beach. 
Admission: $21 for non-dancers; $27 for dancers who are society members; $29 
for dancers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his brief life, poet Robert Burns wrote more than 300 songs. New Year's Eve 
wouldn't be what it is without one of them, "Auld Lang Syne." 
</P>
<P>
People who love Scottish country dancing also owe Burns a thank-you, because 
the tunes for many of their favorite dances come from the poet's songs. 
</P>
<P>
And many of them will be saying thanks in a grand way on Saturday when the Los 
Angeles branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society throws Scotland's 
national poet a 231st birthday party at the Hyatt Edgewater Hotel in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The annual supper and ball not only celebrates a famous poet but it gives 
dancers a festive setting "to show what they can do," said Aase Hansen, a 
society member. There will be music by Scottish bagpipers to accompany a grand 
march of men dressed in kilts, black jackets and ruffled shirts and women 
wearing long dresses accented with tartans. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone walks in and around the room, and this starts the dancing," said 
Hansen, who teaches one of many weekly Scottish dancing classes that the 
Scottish society gives in several communities, including Torrance, Manhattan 
Beach, Westchester and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
During the evening, would-be and authentic Highlanders will perform 18 
different dances, ranging from lively reels to elegant patterns that resemble 
the minuet. 
</P>
<P>
Toasts will be drunk and everyone will get a taste of haggis -- a pudding-like 
dish of oats, suet and organ meat boiled in sheep stomach -- that is 
traditional in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
The words and deeds of Scotland's national poet will be celebrated in the 
"Immortal Memory," a talk that has marked Burns' birthday in Scotland for 
nearly 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Devotees of Scottish dancing say that with the rounds of classes, workshops, 
parties and dinners the society offers, it can easily become an obsession. 
Though she's Danish, Hansen said she got "hooked" on Scottish dancing when she 
took her first class 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great place to make friends," she said, adding that people have begun 
dating after meeting at Scottish dancing activities and some have gotten 
married. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a social and fun activity, and one you get some exercise out of," said 
Scots-born Wilma Fee, who has taught Scottish country dancing for 14 years in 
Manhattan Beach. "The little jigs and reels are very uplifting. You walk into 
the room and your toes start tapping up and down." 
</P>
<P>
It takes four couples to perform a Scottish country dance with its circular and 
chain movements. It most closely resembles American square dancing, which is no 
coincidence, according to society members. Scottish dancing -- with 
contributions from Scandinavian and German dance -- was the basis for the 
American frontier pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Scottish country dancing also has roots in the elegant dancing of the French 
court that Mary Queen of Scots brought to Scotland in the 16th Century. A 
democratic dance, it was enjoyed by everyone from the lord to the country 
lassies. As Hansen put it, it was found "in the barns as well as the great 
hall." 
</P>
<P>
But by the beginning of this century, it had all but died out, and in 1923, the 
country dance society was formed in Scotland to preserve and record the steps. 
People went into villages and interviewed elderly residents about the dances, 
studied old manuscripts and began publishing books -- 35 so far -- detailing 
the traditional dances. 
</P>
<P>
New dances in the old style also have been created. One is "The Reel of the 
21st Division," which was created by British soldiers imprisoned in Germany 
during World War II. "The soldiers, all together, came up with this dance," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fee said new dances often are done for a specific person or an event, citing 
one created for the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
While the "Immortal Memory" talk is usually given by a man, Scottish dancing 
teacher Ann McBride is delivering it at Saturday's birthday bash. And she said 
she intends to emphasize the devotion of the poet's wife, Jean Armour. Though 
he died after only seven years of marriage, she was his widow for nearly 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"My angle is how could this woman be so totally devoted to him," said McBride. 
"She had an infallible memory. He would recite his new poems to her, and she 
would remember them. She had a bright, humorous personality and turned down 
several offers of marriage, preferring to be known as the widow of Robert 
Burns." 
</P>
<P>
McBride said that Burns' immortality in Scotland stems from his honesty. "He 
was down to earth and he never made apologies for himself, never set himself 
down to be anything that he wasn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burns will be in the spotlight on Saturday, but the opportunity to dance 
will be the evening's big attraction for many. 
</P>
<P>
"We listen to the speeches, then we just want to do the dances," Hansen said. 
Gerald Faris What: Robert Burns Supper. When: Saturday, 5:30 p.m. Where: Hyatt 
Edgewater Hotel Empire Ballroom, 6400 E. Pacific Coast Hwy., Long Beach. 
Admission: $21 for non-dancers; $27 for dancers who are society members; $29

MCDONNELL MAY SELL PORTIONS OF DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: ALTHOUGH THE UNIT HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY, IT IS ALSO A BIG PART OF 
ITS PARENT'S DEBT LOAD. ASSETS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO ITS CORE BUSINESS MIGHT 
BE DIVESTED. 
</P>

<P>
McDonnell Douglas has laid the groundwork to divest parts of its Douglas 
Aircraft unit in Long Beach, which has had sharp growth in recent years but 
also has imposed a heavy debt burden on the parent corporation, it was learned 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A corporate policy was recently disclosed inside the company "to consider 
divesting assets" that are not directly related to Douglas' main business of 
assembly and testing of large transport aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Such a policy would leave open to divestiture a number of Douglas programs and 
facilities, including the firm's huge Torrance factory, the largest aircraft 
parts fabrication plant in California. The Torrance plant employs about 5,300 
and the Long Beach plant 37,000. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell spokesman Michael I. Burch in St. Louis said rumors within Douglas in 
recent weeks that the Torrance facility is already for sale or is already sold 
are "wild" and without merit. At the same time, however, he did not exclude a 
possible future sale of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Burch confirmed that the company is examining how it can unload some of the 
work at Douglas and allow the operation to focus its management and other 
resources on its largest aircraft production programs, which are accelerating 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate strategy statement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, 
suggests that parts fabrication is one area that could be divested. Douglas 
already relies on outside suppliers for a significant portion of its major 
parts, including wings, fuselages, control surfaces and a broad range of other 
structural components. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Canada, which builds the wings for the MD-80 narrow body 
jetliners and the wings for the new MD-11 jumbo jetliner, reports to Douglas, 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
A divestiture of parts fabrication facilities would mark a sharp turnaround 
from recent strategy. Douglas has established parts and sub-assembly plants in 
Salt Lake City, Macon, Ga., and Columbus, Ohio, in recent years to relieve 
pressure on its California operations. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its intent to whittle down Douglas Aircraft, McDonnell late last 
year transferred the Navy's T-45 trainer aircraft program from Douglas Aircraft 
to McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Douglas' other non-transport aircraft operations include the 
production of military ejection seats, bomb racks and training systems. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is property around that we are not using, that is certainly a 
candidate," Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
Owing to a historic boom in commercial aircraft sales, Douglas has accumulated 
an estimated $45 billion backlog, including conditional orders. Its C-17 Air 
Force cargo jet program is worth an additional $45 billion in future business. 
</P>
<P>
But to deliver on all those orders, Douglas is incurring enormous inventory 
expenses that have forced the firm to borrow heavily. McDonnell closed 1989 
with an estimated $4.5 billion in debt, and securities analysts project that it 
will have to add another $1 billion this year. It has $3.3 billion in 
shareholder equity. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tough times right now when interest rates are going up and you have 
a lot of debt," said Jack Modzelewski, Paine Webber analyst. "They probably 
have 15 more months before they can get shipments out on the MD-11 and they are 
going to be carrying a big inventory build up. This is an action in which you 
bet the company." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas stock was hammered last year and it is now selling well below 
its book value. The shares dropped an additional $1.625 each Thursday to a new 
52-week low of $58.25. The shares peaked at $94.50 in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Modzelewski said he was not aware of the corporate policy statement to 
divest assets, he added: "This is like selling the dining room furniture to 
make the mortgage payment. They don't want to lose the house." 
</P>
<P>
The corporate policy also states that parts of McDonnell outside of Douglas 
could be divested, but the firm has already been selectively selling off some 
those assets for some time. McDonnell is selling parts of its information 
systems business, for example. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings today and analysts 
will be watching closely for developments at Douglas. So far this year, Douglas 
has posted operating losses of $227 million. All of its major programs are 
running behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The policy under which Douglas assets would be sold was disclosed in the 
minutes of a Jan. 8 meeting of the Douglas Aircraft Executive Council, a joint 
management-union committee. 
</P>
<P>
The minutes, which were posted on a computer bulletin board at the company, 
quoted Douglas Deputy President John P. Capellupo as saying that "the corporate 
policy is that no single MDC (McDonnell Douglas) component will be sold, but 
consideration may be given to selling parts of MDC components. 
</P>
<P>
"During the next 18 months, DAC (Douglas Aircraft Co.) will move toward 
focusing on major and final assembly as well as test functions. Although DAC 
would still have to fabricate some parts, the team has agreed to consider 
divesting assets that either do not conform to the three above-mentioned 
functions, or do not relate to transport aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Divesting these assets would have the benefit of freeing experienced people to 
help meet critical assembly needs, team members said. (Douglas President 
Robert) Hood said the team would pursue these objectives during the course of 
the year, but no schedule has been set."

WHEEL OF FORTUNE TURNS AGAINST FIRST EXECUTIVE;

<P>
INSURANCE: THE FIRM THAT GREW RAPIDLY ON A FOUNDATION OF JUNK BONDS FACES 
MOUNTING PROBLEMS. SOME AGENTS NOW HAVE STOPPED SELLING ITS POLICIES.

<P>
Walt Duemer, president of the leading marketing organization for First 
Executive Corp.'s life insurance policies, says he was forced to eat crow this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
For months, he has told nervous private insurance agents to ignore the negative 
press that Los Angeles-based First Executive has received, to stop worrying 
about the firm's heavy investments in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"When negative publicity has come out, I've said: 'Don't believe any of that 
stuff,' " Duemer says. Instead, he told the agents to look at what counts: the 
stellar ratings given to the company's ability to pay claims by the venerable 
agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, however, following an avalanche of bad news from First 
Executive, the two widely watched ratings agencies lowered their ratings of the 
company. Duemer, president of the Exceptional Producers Group, said the agents 
he deals with -- the largest ones that sell the policies of First Executive's 
big California subsidiary -- have now virtually stopped writing any new life 
insurance business for First Executive. And Duemer said that, since the ratings 
change, he has been left without a plausible argument to persuade them why they 
should. 
</P>
<P>
The wheel of fortune has turned for First Executive: The days of explosive 
growth have ended, and the company's problems -- and stock price -- have 
worsened so significantly just in the past two weeks that it announced Thursday 
that it is waiving a "standstill" agreement with a major shareholder, ICH Corp. 
The waiver will allow ICH to put together a group to make a bid by July to 
acquire First Executive. In Wall Street parlance, this may have put the company 
"in play." But even assuming that one or more viable bids materialize, there is 
concern about how well the company will hold up in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as First Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Carr 
and the firm's new president, Alan C. Snyder, were completing an emergency 
visit to the East Coast to meet with securities analysts, institutional 
investors and brokers in an effort to persuade them that the company still has 
a strong capital position and more than enough cash on hand to meet all 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The company's present situation is a far cry from the heady days of the early 
1980s, when First Executive took the life insurance world by storm, fueling 
exponential growth by offering innovative products and using high-risk, 
high-yield junk bonds to offer rates that competitors couldn't match. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no signs of panic, California insurance regulators and 
insurance industry analysts have been watching closely for any sharp upswing in 
the rate that customers are pulling their money out of First Executive through 
surrenders of life insurance policies or annuities. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Johnson, an attorney in the California Insurance Department, says that 
so far there has been no indication of a run on the firm's big California life 
insurance unit, Executive Life of California. But she says the department is 
monitoring the situation closely because "there is definitely concern." Johnson 
adds that "certainly there are a lot of policyholders out there who are 
concerned about what they've read in the newspapers." (A top regulator at the 
New York Insurance Department, which over the years has imposed tough 
restrictions on the company's New York unit, says Executive Life of New York 
currently has plenty of reserves to meet any upswing in surrenders.) 
</P>
<P>
To judge by First Executive's public statements and its financial reports, the 
firm does have considerable cash on hand to cover any flight by policyholders 
-- more than $2.5 billion in cash or securities readily converted into cash. 
</P>
<P>
But even if policyholders are well protected, the recent developments have led 
to what amounts to a crisis of confidence by the company's shareholders. 
Standard &amp; Poor's lowering of its rating followed these events: 
</P>
<P>
* The firm disclosed last week that it plans to take a $515-million charge 
against fourth-quarter earnings, related to the declining value of its junk 
bond portfolio. As a result, First Executive says it will report substantial 
losses for the quarter and full year. 
</P>
<P>
* Figures put out by the company last week suggest that, just since Sept. 30, 
the market value of its junk bonds portfolio has declined by about $1 billion, 
raising the possibility that further big writedowns may be necessary, 
especially if more bonds held by First Executive go into default. About 45% of 
First Executive's total invested assets are in junk bonds. (Allan L. Chapman, 
vice president of First Executive, denies that additional writedowns are 
likely.) 
</P>
<P>
* The firm announced earlier this month that the planned $460-million sale of 
its New York life insurance subsidiary, Executive Life of New York, had 
collapsed. Although the New York unit has been extremely profitable, the sale 
would have given a needed boost to the parent company's cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
* Last week, the firm also disclosed that the California Insurance Department 
had forced it to reverse a controversial transaction that had appeared to take 
$750 million of risky junk bonds off the firm's balance sheet. The transaction 
had converted the junk bonds into supposedly safer "collateralized bond 
obligations." The department said the transaction had the effect of making 
First Executive's balance sheet look sounder than it actually was. 
</P>
<P>
The combined impact of this news erased more than two-thirds of the value of 
First Executive's common stock in less than a month. Between Dec. 29 and last 
Tuesday, First Executive's common stock plunged to $3 a share from over $9. The 
stock rose 50 cents a share on Wednesday, and following Thursday's 
announcement, it gained another 12.5 cents a share to $3.625 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Carr, who has stated strongly in public that the recent bad news overstates the 
firm's problems, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. He was said to be in 
an airplane, returning to Los Angeles. However, Chapman said the company "is in 
a very strong financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
The company's true heyday was in the early 1980s when, using such then-new 
products as single-premium deferred annuities, Carr was able to lure huge 
numbers of customers with attractive rates and the special tax benefits that 
such products then offered. A prominent mutual fund manager in the late 1960s, 
Carr had come to First Executive with little expertise in the insurance 
industry. When business took off, Carr was noted for the steps he took to 
lavishly reward top agents and brokers who sold his products, including trips 
to London and Rome, complete with surprise side trips on specially booked 
Concorde jets. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company has weathered repeated major reversals. The collapse of 
companies such as Baldwin-United and Charter Co., which sold products similar 
to those offered by First Executive, left a taint on the firm even though it 
remained financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
Congress revised the tax laws in 1988 to take away many of the advantages of 
deferred annuities. And Carr and his company have come in for bad publicity 
from his long, close association with Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert's 
former junk bond chief who is under indictment on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Carr's association with Milken was a crucial element of First Executive's 
success, which was based in large measure on astute purchases and trading of 
junk bonds. First Executive has acknowledged that it has been under 
investigation by federal prosecutors in the Milken case, although no action 
appears imminent and the company strongly denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But in the company's report on its performance for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 
1989, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, First Executive 
stated: "The adverse publicity has diminished consumer and agent confidence, 
and in combination with other factors, may have contributed to lower sales and 
higher surrenders than might otherwise have been the case." 
</P>
<P>
The most decisive blow so far, however, has been the collapse of junk bond 
prices in recent months, touched off by defaults and bankruptcies by several 
notable companies financed by junk bonds. According to Fred Townsend, an 
analyst at the Connecticut-based insurance rating firm of Townsend &amp; 
Schupp, although First Executive is taking a $515-million year-end charge, that 
amounts to only a portion of the decline in market value of the junk bonds in 
its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from immediate worries that customers or even whole marketing agencies 
might abandon First Executive, its current financial situation and ratings 
decline raise longer-term worries, analysts say. A chief concern is whether the 
company will be able to raise its capital back up to the point where regulators 
will allow it to expand business. 
</P>
<P>
Life insurance companies are required to have big cushions of capital reserves 
on hand to meet claims, so they must raise capital to grow. In the past, Carr 
raised the money to grow from public investors, selling various issues of 
preferred stock or, last year, a rights offering of special stock and warrants. 
</P>
<P>
But, Townsend says, investors may now be so worried about the state of First 
Executive's junk bond holdings that they won't be willing to put up more cash. 
"If he can't get cash, he can't put any more money into the California 
subsidiary," Townsend says. The California unit is considered to be in more 
immediate need of new capital than the New York unit. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's Chapman acknowledges that it would be difficult to raise 
money now. But he asserts that with the growth of the business temporarily 
stalled, there isn't any immediate need to raise more capital. 
</P>
<P>
Protestations by Carr and other First Executive officials that the company's 
economic fundamentals are strong might carry more weight if some securities 
analysts hadn't been made nervous by a variety of accounting practices that 
have been called into question. In 1987, the New York Insurance Department 
imposed its biggest fine ever on a life insurance company -- $250,000 -- for 
Executive Life's reinsurance practices that violated state regulations. 
Regulators concluded that Executive Life of New York had been trying to cover 
up that it was undercapitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The juggling of junk bonds into "collateralized" securities, originally 
discovered by Joseph Belth, editor of a newsletter called the Insurance Forum, 
also gave cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said the company has complied with generally accepted accounting 
practices.

FUTURES SELLING PUTS A DRAG ON MARKET; DOW TUMBLES 43.46

<P>
Stock prices ended sharply lower Thursday as a last-hour flurry of 
futures-related selling toppled a market already pessimistic about interest 
rates and corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 43.46 to 2,561.04, closing for 
the first time below the 2,569.26 level that it hit last Oct. 13 in a severe 
but short-lived selloff. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 539 up, 937 down and 474 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 172.27 million shares, down from 207.83 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said few investors were in a hurry to commit funds as disappointing 
earnings reports continued to roll in. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers had also pulled back before fourth-quarter gross national product data 
due today. "No one wants to be a hero," said Dillon Read &amp; Co. head trader 
Daniel Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say the GNP, the nation's total output of goods and services, 
expanded in the period but at a much slower rate than in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose on the Japanese stock market after a series of recent selloffs that 
had unsettled other markets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers said that apparently wasn't enough to allay fears that the risks of 
a persistent slump in economic growth and corporate profits were increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Bargain hunting caused stocks to rise in early trading, but it was not 
sustained. 
</P>
<P>
Gruntal &amp; Co.'s director of technical research, Gene Jay Seagle, believes 
that the lack of buying is fostering the market's decline. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no foreign interest, so we're getting very decided selling in stocks 
like International Business Machines, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing and 
Procter &amp; Gamble," Seagle said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a key area, and that shows up very quickly in this market." The dearth 
of interest, combined with thin volume, makes the market more vulnerable to 
program trading, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates reversed an early decline and extended their recent rise 
Thursday in the market for U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more blue chip companies came in with fourth-quarter earnings 
reports that disappointed investors. 
</P>
<P>
DuPont ranked among the volume leaders, down 2 at 37 3/8. On Wednesday, the 
company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 71 cents a share, barely topping 
the 70 cents a share that it posted a year ago. Seagram Co., which owns a large 
stake in DuPont, tumbled 6 3/8 to 76 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble, which also posted virtually flat quarterly profit, fell 3 
1/2 to 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Other losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, 
down 1 5/8 at 95 7/8; Philip Morris, down 1 at 37; Exxon, down 1 at 46; General 
Electric, down 1 1/4 at 62, and American Express, down 3/4 at 29 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Single-country investment companies provided some conspicuous exceptions to the 
downtrend. Taiwan Fund gained 7/8 to 50 1/8; Italy Fund rose 1 to 18; Korea 
Fund added 2 3/4 to 33 5/8, and Germany Fund rose 1 1/8 to 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The latest entry in that increasingly crowded field, the New Germany Fund, 
soared to 22 in its first day of trading, from an offering price of 15. 
</P>
<P>
The average share on the New York Stock Exchange was down 38 cents. The NYSE 
Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 2.03 to 180.61. The Standard 
&amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 4.18 to 326.08. 
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.03 to 353.64; the NASDAQ 
over-the-counter index was down 0.42 to 425.24. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices recovered partly from Wednesday's 600-point drop but the 
market remained jittery. The 225-share Nikkei average rose 190.13 to 36,969.11. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares ended firmer but below the day's highs after Wall Street lost 
its early gains. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 11.3 at 2,289.9.

L.A. INSURER OPENS WAY FOR BID; SEC LAUNCHES PROBE OF COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Executive Corp. canceled a restrictive agreement with its biggest 
shareholder Thursday, opening the door for ICH Corp. to submit a bid for the 
once high-flying Los Angeles life insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, First Executive revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
has launched "an informal, private investigation" of the company, which said it 
is voluntarily submitting documents to the regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC inquiry and First Executive's decision to cancel its so-called 
standstill agreement with ICH are both apparently related to a number of woes 
that recently beset the company, including problems with California regulators, 
a souring junk bond portfolio and a severely depressed stock price. 
</P>
<P>
ICH, a Louisville, Ky., insurance holding company that already owns more than 
20% of First Executive's stock, said it plans to marshal a "group" and make an 
offer for the now troubled parent of Executive Life Insurance Co. of California 
before July. ICH has already approached several of First Executive's biggest 
shareholders, said Travis Reed, who holds about 4% of the company's stock and 
says he will be part of the bidding group. 
</P>
<P>
Reed expects that a company controlled by heiress Caroline Rose Hunt will also 
join the group. Hunt's company, Rosewood Financial, already owns about 10% of 
First Executive's stock and has been highly critical of the company's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, First Executive's management and board steadfastly fought several 
attempts to kill the agreement with ICH, even though some big shareholders 
argued that it effectively detered all prospective buyers from submitting bids 
that could enhance First Executive's market value. Shareholders narrowly 
defeated a proposal to cancel the standstill arrangement last July, in fact, at 
the board's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's directors reconsidered their position Wednesday in light of 
the company's market value, said Vice President Allan L. Chapman. Shares, which 
were as high as $17 last year, closed at $3.625 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock has been pummeled by a series of events starting with the aborted 
sale of First Executive's New York insurance subsidiary early this year. W. W. 
Acquisition Corp., which had agreed to buy the unit for $460 million, was 
unable to arrange financing for the deal. First Executive later said the unit 
was no longer for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Then, late last week, the company announced that it would write down $515 
million in unrealized losses in its $6.5-billion junk bond portfolio, resulting 
in a substantial loss for the year. The company simultaneously announced that 
it had settled a scuffle with California insurance regulators, who objected to 
the way First Executive accounted for a $750-million pool of junk bonds. First 
Executive added $110 million to its reserve for securities losses last Friday 
as part of that settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is interested in the charges that First Executive took against its junk 
bond portfolio, Chapman said. Further details about the SEC investigation were 
not readily available. 
</P>
<P>
The company said these events have caused "policyholder and agent apprehension" 
as well as a slide in its market value that "in the company's view, are 
exaggerated and unwarranted." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts said any buyout offers that First Executive might 
attract are likely to be close to the firm's current market price. And others 
are skeptical that First Executive will find any serious buyers at all. 
</P>
<P>
"For anyone to make a bid, they would have to have a high degree of confidence 
that the number and severity of defaults Executive Life would be exposed to (in 
its junk bond portfolio) would be relatively modest," said Fred Townsend, 
principal of Townsend &amp; Schupp, an insurance rating firm in Connecticut. 
With the economy souring and investors shying away from these high-risk bonds, 
it seems unlikely that any buyer would offer much more than the company's 
current market price, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Rosencrants, senior vice president and director of research for 
Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. in Atlanta, said he does not believe that any 
serious bids will emerge for First Executive -- regardless of ICH's apparent 
interest in bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I regard this announcement by First Executive as a sign of desperation," 
Rosencrants said. "There are such extraordinary uncertainties here that no one 
will step in to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
ICH has been struggling with financial problems on its own, he added. And even 
healthy companies are having difficulty finding financing for takeovers in 
today's environment.

SENATE PANEL PROBES 1ST EXECUTIVE'S 'JUNK PENSIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate subcommittee on labor said Thursday that it has opened an 
investigation into what it terms "junk pensions" offered by the Los 
Angeles-based insurance holding company First Executive Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.-Ohio), the subcommittee's chairman, 
noted that a number of large companies had replaced their pension plans with 
annuities from the Executive Life insurance units of First Executive. 
Metzenbaum noted that a large portion of the insurance companies' invested 
assets are in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds and that rating agencies 
recently lowered their ratings of the units' ability to pay claims. First 
Executive has also said it will take a $515-million charge for its 1989 fourth 
quarter because of the plunging value of its junk bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum said the developments raised questions about the First Executive 
units' ability to pay benefits, including pensions. The firm, however, has said 
it has more than $2.5 billion in cash on hand, ample reserves for losses and 
isn't in any danger of defaulting on its obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee said it will hold hearings into Coleman Co.'s purchase of 
pension benefits from First Executive after investor Ronald O. Perelman 
acquired Coleman earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Wichita, Kan., firm manufactures Coleman lanterns and other camping 
products. Metzenbaum said in the statement that "I am concerned about the 
pensions of the thousands of workers at Coleman Lantern and dozens of other 
companies which we understand have pension contracts with Executive Life." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Perelman couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional source said the company was examining transactions in which the 
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financed leveraged buyouts or 
hostile takeovers of companies and helped bring in First Executive to write 
annuities after the new owners canceled the existing pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive, had a close business 
relationship with Drexel's former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, currently 
under indictment on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's statement said that "because of its reliance on junk bonds, 
Executive has been able to offer corporate raiders annuities at very low 
prices." It noted that Coleman workers have expressed concern about the safety 
of the annuities. 
</P>
<P>
Allan L. Chapman, vice president of First Executive, said he wasn't aware of 
the Senate investigation and declined to comment on the concerns expressed in 
the subcommittee's statement.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW EXPERTS PINPOINT PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When things began to bog down for patients and doctors at the Chico Medical 
Group, the 28 physicians who own the corporation hired a productivity 
consultant to help them figure out ways to work smarter. Sharon Stone, medical 
group administrator, said the doctors called in the consultants because they 
wanted to improve patient service while keeping labor costs down. 
</P>
<P>
"A productivity consultant gives you some statistics to make sound business 
judgments," said Stone. "They don't give you a magical cure for all your ills." 
</P>
<P>
For four months, an analyst from Western Productivity Group in Palo Alto spent 
about eight hours a day observing every aspect of life at the Chico Medical 
Group. Before improvements could be made, the analyst had to figure out how 
patients moved through the system, how they paid for their care and how the 
doctors and other health-care providers communicated with staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"She asked lots of questions," said Stone. "She and the others who worked with 
us explained that they were here to help us work smarter, not faster." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the $60,000 study, the medical group implemented several of the 
consultants' suggestions, including improvements in the patient check-in area, 
billing department, medical transcription department and data processing. The 
consultants even recommended a change in the type of note pads used for 
telephone messages to ensure their getting to the right people. 
</P>
<P>
Productivity consultants offer various services to small-business owners. Some 
firms specialize in analyzing specific tasks, such as how long it takes a 
secretary to type a report. Others take a bigger picture approach, studying how 
systems work. 
</P>
<P>
Most consultants charge about $120 an hour, but the fees can be as low as $50 
or $60 an hour. Ray Dillard, president of Western Productivity Group in Palo 
Alto, said the Chico Medical Group could save between $250,000 and $300,000 by 
implementing his recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
For manufacturers, a productivity consultant can figure out how long it takes 
employees to do a certain task. Then the measurements are used to develop 
standards and to figure out how many people to hire. 
</P>
<P>
"Because not every person can meet the standards, we try to look at the group 
doing the task and not the individual," said Joe Lima, director of instrument 
operations at Lifescan, which makes blood glucose monitors in Milpitas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Lima, who has worked with several productivity consultants through the years, 
said it is important for the consultant to work with employees to present 
possible solutions to management. 
</P>
<P>
"The best consultants walk away with everyone thinking the consultant didn't do 
anything," said Lima. 
</P>
<P>
Lima said small-business owners should choose a productivity consultant 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure to ask exactly what will be delivered under the contract," said Lima. 
"Ask if the consultant will supply the standards and train a trainer to teach 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
When interviewing productivity consultants, small-business owners should check 
references and call other clients for information. Then be sure to meet with 
the person who will be doing the actual work, rather than just the president or 
marketing director for the consulting firm. Dwight Shackelford, president of 
Shackelford and Warner Associates in Beverly Hills, is a "white-collar" 
productivity consultant who helps businesses solve their paper work problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things that can be done to help small-business owners," 
said Shackelford. He said owners can respond quickly to productivity problems 
if they watch for the symptoms. "Extensive overtime means something is wrong," 
he said. "Other signs would be if paper flow is backing up and if workers are 
missing deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford said owners should watch whether workers are walking around the 
office more than necessary. "If they are moving, they aren't working," said 
Shackelford. 
</P>
<P>
Dillard said small-business owners can help boost productivity themselves by 
keeping a close watch on the company's operations to spot trouble before it 
gets out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to continually adjust your costs as your sales change," advises 
Dillard. "Don't wait until the end of the month for results; you need to have 
this kind of information at your fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
Dillard said a savvy small-business owner will listen carefully to what his or 
her salespeople are saying and then factor that into all decisions. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how small your business is, you should keep close track of direct 
labor costs, indirect labor costs, fixed and variable overhead costs and 
general and administrative costs. According to Dillard, direct labor costs -- 
the cost of keeping your employees -- should represent 10% to 11% of total 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"If sales drop and you don't respond, this percentage could creep up as high as 
20%," said Dillard. 
</P>
<P>
If sales drop and laying off workers seems too drastic, Dillard suggests asking 
your employees to work a shortened work week until sales pick up again. "A 
quick response to problems is the key to managing a small business," said 
Dillard.

EASTERN OFFERS UNSECURED CREDITORS 10 CENTS ON DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since filing for bankruptcy last March, Eastern Airlines has consistently vowed 
to pay all creditors in full, but it made a significant reversal on Thursday in 
offering unsecured creditors just 10 cents on the dollar, in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled carrier said it would repay another 70% of its debt over the next 
decade, though without interest. In return, Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., 
said it would give creditors up to 40% of its equity in the Miami-based 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan proposes that certain creditors make contributions to assure 
Eastern's post-reorganization successful operations and participate in the 
equity of the company," Eastern said in a statement released as creditors met 
here Thursday. It predicted that its plan "would enable the company to emerge 
from bankruptcy as soon as midyear as a strong competitor with $500 million in 
cash, access to new aircraft and a revamped, more conservative balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
The carrier said unsecured creditors would also get preferred stock with a 
liquidation value of $80 million and convertible into 40% of its common stock, 
though it did not explain when or under what conditions the issue could be 
converted. (Unsecured debts are obligations not backed by specific collateral 
and include payments for jet fuel, catering, landing fees and airplane leases.) 
</P>
<P>
Eastern added that holders of secured debt would be paid in full, and that 
holders of $45 million in tickets purchased before bankruptcy would be fully 
reimbursed once the plan is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's president, Phil Bakes, called the plan "fair for all the 
financial stake holders in the company." 
</P>
<P>
The new reorganization plan, the latest of several offered by the airline, must 
be approved by Eastern's creditor committee and, ultimately, by Federal 
Bankruptcy Court. It is almost certain that creditors will insist on 
modifications, but no one representing them could be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, with its watered-down payment offer, resulted from the recent 
dismal performance of the airline industry and from greatly increased fuel 
prices, analysts said. Eastern's planes flew only 53.7% full in December, down 
from 57.2% 12 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration has caused lower-than-anticipated revenues," said analyst 
John W. Mattis of Shearson Lehman Hutton. "As a result Texas Air is willing to 
give up 40% of its ownership to keep the airline going." 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Paul Karos of First Boston Corp. said he interprets the plan as 
"Eastern saying in the long term that it cannot make money with the capital 
structure it now has. It needs breathing room, and is asking its creditors for 
significant concessions in return for stock." If Eastern prospers, he said, 
these shareholders could also benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it will report a $280-million loss for the last quarter of 1989 
and a loss of $850 million for the year. It also predicted that it will lose 
$125 million in the present quarter, cut the loss to about $30 million in the 
second quarter and break even in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The airline has been operating under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code 
since last March 9 -- five days after its machinists, pilots and flight 
attendants struck. Only the machinists remain on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said it will ask the court for an additional $100 million from the 
$600 million that it holds in escrow as proceeds from selling off assets. It 
previously sought $210 million.

UAL EXPLORES SELLING UNIONS 75% OF UNITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The board of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, directed its advisers on 
Thursday to explore the possible sale of a 75% stake in the company to unions 
representing the airline's pilots, flight attendants and machinists. But it 
also invited other acquisition offers -- including that of former suitor Marvin 
Davis of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The board, under pressure to boost UAL's stock price, instructed its legal and 
financial advisers to study a possible recapitalization of the company as well. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, the board cleared the way for a new bid by billionaire 
investor Davis by freeing him from an agreement that required a minimum offer 
of $300 a share. But such a bid appeared unlikely. A spokesman for the real 
estate and oil magnate said Davis neither sought release from the agreement nor 
was working on a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had triggered UAL's takeover turmoil with a failed $240-per-share offer 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
The board also released British Airways from a similar agreement, but the 
airline said it is no longer interested. 
</P>
<P>
The board faces pressure from the New York money-management firm of Coniston 
Partners to raise the value of UAL shares. Coniston owns 11.8% of UAL's stock 
and has threatened to oust the board unless it acts. The union proposal is 
likely to appease Coniston, at least for now, because the firm favors an 
employee transaction and has said it would help finance such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's board said it would review all offers, including the union proposal, at 
its next meeting on Feb. 22. It added that it may not receive an acceptable 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
The board also indicated that the current union proposal is too sketchy to 
constitute an acquisition offer. Indeed, the union proposal is far from 
complete and doesn't address significant details. For example, the unions have 
not decided how much to pay for UAL, or what form the offer would take. 
</P>
<P>
Stock traders on Thursday speculated that the unions would offer a combination 
of cash and securities worth between $200 and $225 a share. They said a 
recapitalization without union ownership would probably be worth $190 a share. 
</P>
<P>
UAL common stock fell $3 to $158.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange 
on Thursday. Traders were disappointed at the airline's dismal fourth-quarter 
earnings and unhappy that the takeover drama remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously missing from the union proposal is a role for UAL Chairman 
Stephen M. Wolf, a proponent of employee ownership who led a failed employee 
bid for the airline last fall. Wolf removed himself from buyout negotiations 
shortly before Christmas, turning discussions over to UAL's legal advisers, and 
hasn't met with the unions since. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf's credibility with employees suffered after the $300-per-share 
pilot-management bid collapsed last October, triggering a one-day stock market 
mini-crash. Wolf and John C. Pope, UAL's chief financial officer, were 
criticized for discouraging lenders from financing the deal by offering skimpy 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf also came under fire when it was revealed that he stood to make $76 
million from his stock and options if the transaction succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
People familiar with the situation said it it still possible that Wolf will 
join the proposed union-led transaction, but union leaders have privately 
discussed possible replacements for him should he choose not to participate and 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stock analysts said the union proposal might be difficult to finance, 
despite the fact that the unions are willing to invest about 13% of UAL's 
payroll, or $2 billion over five years, mostly in the form of wage concessions. 
The unions haven't yet held discussions with lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Mark E. Daugherty of Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said lenders have grown 
increasingly jittery about leveraged deals, especially since the collapse of 
Campeau Corp.'s retail empire. In addition, he said, UAL, along with the rest 
of the airline industry, is experiencing rising costs and softening passenger 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hostile environment all around," Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
UAL also reported that fourth-quarter earnings dropped 67% to $6.8 million due 
to rising fuel cost and expenses related to last October's failed takeover. On 
an operating basis, the fourth quarter was a disaster, with UAL recording a 
$31.3-million loss, contrasted with a $122.8-million profit in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, it said, earnings fell 14% to $324.3 million, excluding a gain 
in 1988 from the sale of partnerships in its Covia computer reservation system. 
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 9% to $2.4 billion, increasing the year's total to 
$9.8 billion, an 8% rise.

RACE TO DEVELOP HIGH-DEFINITION TV INTENSIFIES 
</P>

The competition to develop high-definition television revved up on Thursday 
with the announcement that the U.S. divisions of two European electronics 
giants have joined NBC-TV to research advanced TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
Philips Consumer Electronics Co. said it will join an existing research venture 
of Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc. and NBC. Philips is part of NV Philips of 
the Netherlands, while Thomson is the U.S. division of Thomson SA of France. 
</P>
<P>
The venture faces stiff competition from research efforts under way in Japan 
and Europe into high-definition television, which promises picture quality as 
crisp as photographs and crystal-clear sound. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major TV manufacturer in the 
United States, has joined American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to develop an 
HDTV system. 
</P>
<P>
The new three-way alliance of Philips, Thomson and NBC drew praise from several 
industry observers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fairly wise, competitive decision," said Pat Hill Hubbard, a 
vice president of the American Electronics Assn. "Research is very costly in 
this field." 
</P>
<P>
Laura J. Lederman, an analyst with the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; 
Phelps Inc., said the combination of manufacturers and broadcasters was 
critical. "If you have companies that build a set but you don't have 
broadcasters, you're missing some of the pieces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Philips and Thomson control almost 40% of the U.S. television-set 
market. Philips makes the Magnavox, Sylvania, Philco and Philips brands, while 
Thomson owns the former General Electric and RCA lines. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., has been cooperating with Thomson 
for several years at the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., to 
develop advanced television systems. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and Thomson are working on a system called Advanced Compatible TV, which 
would provide an improved picture on new wide-screen TV sets while allowing 
continued use of conventional sets. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Compatible TV would require only minor, low-cost adjustments to 
equipment at local TV stations, Thomson and NBC said.

BUSH SEEKING $1.1 BILLION MORE FOR DRUG WAR IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, claiming his anti-drug fight already is showing signs of 
success, Thursday unveiled Phase II -- same policy, more money. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan contains no major departures from the first phase of the drug war, 
which was begun last year. However, it requests a substantial increase in funds 
-- roughly $1.1 billion more, for a total of $10.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made some notable progress," Bush told members of the American Newspaper 
Publisher's Assn. as he announced his plans, but "it's clear we're only getting 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a press conference, Bush described the anti-drug fight as "the big 
one . . . a test" for his Administration and "every state, every local 
government, the people." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush's aides insist, that test is being passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there were many more people saying the war on drugs was not 
winnable," drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett said. People considered 
the problem to be "like Godzilla," but now "we've got a strong rope and we're 
building a cage for him." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the cost of the anti-drug campaign will continue to escalate. 
"In 1990, drug funding totaled almost $9.5 billion . . . the largest increase 
in history," Bush said in his speech. "Funding for fiscal '91 will be expanded 
by more than $1 billion," to $10.6 billion, "and outlays will increase 41% this 
year. In fact, with this request, the federal drug budget will be 69% higher 
than it was when I took office in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
In Phase I of his drug plan, Bush offered what he called the country's first 
comprehensive effort to coordinate all federal anti-drug efforts into one 
campaign. The money provided aid to Latin American nations, education, 
treatment and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, about 29% of the money for Phase II will be spent overseas on drug 
interdiction efforts and aid to Latin American nations. Another 29% will be 
spent on efforts to reduce domestic drug demand, such as education and 
treatment programs. The remaining 42% goes to federal law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest single increase in Bush's plan would go to the military, which 
plans to devote roughly $1 billion of its estimated $295-billion budget to 
anti-drug efforts next year, mostly to monitor and track drug shipments 
entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to proposing more spending, Bush reiterated his call for an 
expanded federal death penalty. His proposal would allow the execution of drug 
kingpins who kill law enforcement officers or whose actions lead to the deaths 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that the death penalty alone is a solution," said John 
Walters, Bennett's chief of staff. But, he added, for the most serious 
drug-related crimes, the ultimate penalty "is just." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the new plan designates five areas of the country -- 
including Los Angeles County -- as "high intensity" drug trafficking regions, 
eligible for additional federal resources. Although the added federal resources 
are minimal -- $25 million this year and $50 million next year spread across 
all five regions -- local officials have been furiously lobbying for the 
designations. 
</P>
<P>
In part to calm that lobbying, the official plan released Thursday noted that 
the Los Angeles designation "could include" Orange County and other surrounding 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, however, the new money will go only to federal agencies, 
not state or local bodies, and the federal agencies based in Los Angeles have 
jurisdiction throughout the federal central judicial district of California -- 
a multicounty region stretching from San Luis Obispo south to Orange County and 
east into Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Imperial counties will be designated as part of a Southwest 
Border high-intensity area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the high-intensity designation will bring only a small increase in 
funds, federal officials note that, even without the designation, the 
government will, under Bush's plan, spend roughly $169 million on anti-drug 
efforts in Los Angeles and the surrounding counties. That would be an 11% 
increase over the level for the current year. 
</P>
<P>
The spending in the Los Angeles region -- which includes everything from FBI 
officers to federal funds for treatment centers -- is considerably lower than 
in other major drug-trafficking centers. In Miami, Bush is proposing $223 
million for next year; $436 million for New York, and $187 million for Houston. 
Administration officials Thursday could not offer a reason for the differences. 
</P>
<P>
As he did last year, Bush pledged to increase federal spending on anti-drug 
efforts "without adding to the budget deficit" or raising taxes. He refused to 
say what federal programs might have to be cut to accomplish that goal, 
although some answers to that question may be disclosed when Bush announces his 
overall federal budget proposal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every federal agency, from the Department of Health and Human 
Services to the Pentagon to the national research laboratory at Los Alamos, N. 
M., has been busily reworking existing programs to make them eligible for the 
growing flood of anti-drug funds. Given that activity, Congress, as it did last 
year, is almost certain to add even more money to the anti-drug war to fund 
programs favored by congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Bush's plan drew praise from Republican lawmakers and mixed reactions 
from Democrats. The new plan has "big holes in it, but it's a lot more than we 
had before" Bush started emphasizing the issue, said Rep. Charles B. Rangel 
(D-N.Y.), who is chairman of the House Committee on Narcotics and Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the Senate Democrats' chief 
spokesman on drug issues, had proposed a plan that would spend $14.6 billion 
next year. Biden has criticized Bush for placing too much emphasis on casual 
drug use, which already is in decline. His plan would add considerably more 
money to efforts to treat hard-core drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Adding more money would be fine, said Bennett, who lost several fights within 
the Administration over spending levels. "You can always spend more money."

AZERBAIJANIS TRY TO SALVAGE THEIR IMAGE 
</P>

<P>
Black flags of mourning flutter outside the Azerbaijani mission here, and 
weary, unshaven officials huddle over their telephones around the clock inside, 
caught up in what they describe as a virtual war to save the image of the 
Azerbaijani people. 
</P>
<P>
They cannot do much, they say, about their dead countrymen being buried miles 
to the south in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital -- people killed when Soviet 
troops shot their way into the city early last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But on the telephones, they are organizing money and medical supplies to send 
to people living under the Kremlin's state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, they say, they are trying to tell the world the 
Azerbaijani point of view, which they feel has been lost amid the reports of 
violence against Armenians earlier in the month. 
</P>
<P>
Since the latest round of anti-Armenian violence erupted Jan. 13 in Baku and 
Soviet troops swept into the city a week later, foreign journalists have been 
barred from entering Azerbaijan. They have had to rely on word of mouth, 
including wild rumors. 
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than 170 Armenians and Azerbaijanis were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
The people at the Azerbaijani mission in Moscow said they think the picture has 
been painted with strokes too broad, coloring all Azerbaijanis -- predominantly 
Shiite Muslims -- as bloodthirsty criminals and showing their nationalism as 
ethnic bias rather than pride. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to the Armenians in Baku is horrible," Zaur P. Rustam-Zade, the 
deputy head of mission, told a reporter, "and those responsible should be found 
and punished. Many Azerbaijanis helped their Armenian neighbors, and the whole 
nation should not be damned." 
</P>
<P>
Zakhrab Shamkhalov, chief of the Moscow branch of the nationalist Azerbaijani 
Popular Front, noted: "We've called for organizing a commission to investigate 
and find out who is responsible. But nothing justifies the violence the Soviet 
army carried out against Baku and its innocent citizens." 
</P>
<P>
So far, 139 Azerbaijanis have been arrested and charged with attacking 
Armenians, hurling some from balconies and burning others alive. More than 
13,000 Armenians were evacuated from Baku in mid-January, according to official 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
It is the Azerbaijani refugees who left Armenia in February, 1988, after the 
first wave of violence over the Azerbaijani-controlled enclave of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, who are thought to bear the primary blame for this month's 
outbreak of violence against Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
After 32 Armenians were killed in 1988 in a clash over the future of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia, fearful of 
retribution, moved to Azerbaijan.

Armenia and Azerbaijan both stake a historical claim to Nagorno-Karabakh, an 
autonomous region within Azerbaijan. And the territorial dispute combined with 
religious differences -- Armenians are mostly Christian -- has led to the 
bloodiest of the many ethnic conflicts among the more than 100 nationalities of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The republic's government never did enough for those Azerbaijani refugees," 
Rustam-Zade said. "About 90,000 of them live in Baku in terrible conditions, 
many in huts and without good jobs. They are bitter and, without doubt, some 
are so angry they are ready to commit crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Rustam-Zade, whose mother and brother live in Baku, said some stories told by 
fleeing Armenians have made it appear that the 1.8 million people living in 
Baku are all animals. 
</P>
<P>
"That's causing trouble for everyone," he said. "The latest rumor, spread by 
the Soviet military commander of Baku, is that Russian people are not safe 
there. So we are getting dozens of telephone calls from Moscow and Leningrad, 
with Russians threatening the safety of Azerbaijanis in those cities." 
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 Azerbaijanis live in Leningrad and about 40,000 in Moscow. 
Rustam-Zade said his people have been told that "if anything happens to a 
single Russian in Azerbaijan," Azerbaijanis living in Moscow and Leningrad will 
be punished. 
</P>
<P>
The fear among Russians in Baku for their personal safety has given rise to 
fresh panic among that city's Azerbaijanis, who are already emotionally 
exhausted by events of the last two weeks, Rustam-Zade said. 
</P>
<P>
"They think if the Russians are afraid to stay, maybe it is because the troops 
are going to launch another bloody attack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalism, long a factor in Azerbaijan, has burst into the open only in the 
last couple of years, accompanied by a resurgence of religious passion. 
</P>
<P>
After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Azerbaijan was an independent republic 
until 1920, when Baku, riven by political dissension, fell without a shot to 
Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's first step was to try to discourage or repress outright the 
practice of Islam, and it had some success. 
</P>
<P>
As the overt practice of Islam withered away in the 1930s, nationalist problems 
declined as well. But there is evidence that many people, including young 
people, have continued to quietly practice Islam. 
</P>
<P>
All this created a situation that remained quietly unstable for years, coming 
to the fore only with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rise to power in Moscow. 
Gorbachev, in calling for greater tolerance, inadvertently helped bring on the 
growth of Islamic power in Azerbaijan -- and the growth of nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Also during this time, Islamic fundamentalism was receiving a boost under the 
leadership of radical Shiite Muslim leaders in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani leaders here say it is too late to try to crush the nationalism, 
that it would only backfire. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet army made a mistake," Shamkhalov said. "The Azerbaijani people will 
no longer be forced into submission."

CHENEY TARGETS MAJOR BASES IN STATE TO CLOSE

<P>
The Defense Department has prepared an extensive list of military bases it 
plans to close or consolidate in the United States and overseas, including 
several major California installations, military and congressional sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the California facilities slated for closure are the Long Beach Naval 
Shipyard and the Army's Ft. Ord, near Monterey, Pentagon sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The list, although not finalized, targets scores of large and small facilities 
across the country and is certain to set off a clamorous debate as Congress 
begins to wrestle with a new defense budget that begins to fundamentally alter 
the nation's military posture. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will formally present the list of proposed base 
closures on Monday when he introduces the $295-billion Pentagon budget proposal 
for the 1991 fiscal year beginning in October. Pentagon officials cautioned 
that final shape of the base closure proposal will depend to some extent on 
discussions set for this weekend with members of Congress and officials of 
allied governments overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy proposed to close the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which employs about 
5,000 military and civilian workers in reconditioning Navy ships, as well as 
the Navy's major East Coast shipyard in Philadelphia. Defense analysts estimate 
that closing the Long Beach shipyard could save the Navy an estimated $8 
million a year. The Long Beach Naval Station was not proposed for closure. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Navy's hit list are a number of relatively small naval air stations 
from Oakland to South Weymouth, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The list of Army installations alone contains 126 facilities, Army sources said 
Thursday, including Ft. Ord, home of the Army's 7th Infantry Division. Army 
planners propose to move the entire division to Ft. Lewis, in Washington state. 
The 9th Infantry Division and its large support staff, based at Ft. Lewis, 
would be sharply cut back, Army sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dead," said an Army official, who added that Ft. Ord's "lousy" training 
area and the cost of living in the area were critical factors in the Army's 
decision to move the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Ord employs more than 15,000 military personnel and 1,800 civilian workers, 
making it one of Monterey County's major employers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Army has proposed to shutter several Army depots, including 
several in Central California. Those installations are small enough that Cheney 
is not required to seek congressional approval for the moves. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy apparently has targeted a number of San Francisco Bay area facilities 
for closure or major manpower reductions. Included are the Treasure Island 
Naval Station in San Francisco, the Alameda Naval Air Station, the Oakland 
Naval Supply Center, the Oakland Naval Hospital and Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The five Northern California installations together have a payroll of $900 
million, employing 21,000 servicemen and 11,000 civilians, and their closure 
could cause an economic loss to the areas of up to $3.8 billion, a Pentagon 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Army's largest and best-known military bases are slated for closure 
or significant troop cuts, Army officials said Thursday. The Army has proposed 
to close Ft. McClellan, Ala., and is recommending manpower cuts at Ft. Knox, 
Ky.; Ft. Hood, Tex.; Ft. Rucker, Ala.; Ft. Benning, Ga.; Ft. Benjamin Harrison, 
Ind., and Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
One of two divisions based at Ft. Hood, the 2nd Armored Division, which is 
dedicated for use in the defense of Western Europe, has been slated for 
complete demobilization by 1992, Army officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Army base closures are part of a larger plan to restructure the nation's 
largest military service to accommodate shrinking budgets and a reduced threat 
from the Soviet Union and the disintegrating Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"These bases are superfluous to our needs," said one Army officer. "Two years 
ago the Army looked out into its future and started planning for a smaller 
Army. We're now embarked on a course for change to maintain readiness in the 
near term and the long-term to deploy a deployable and lethal Army by 1995. 
This is absolutely part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next four years, the Army proposes to cut troop strength by 135,000, 
from the current level of about 760,000 men and women. The plan calls for 
reducing European deployments under arms agreements with the Soviets and for 
reshaping U.S.-based units into a lighter, fast-reaction force for use in 
contingency operations around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, Air Force and Marines have proposed smaller troop cuts but have 
offered to forgo a number of expensive weapons systems in order to meet their 
share of budget reductions Cheney has proposed. A comprehensive list of 
facilities that these services are proposing to close or consolidate was not 
available Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But sources in Congress confirmed that the Navy has proposed closing the 
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a major shipbuilding and repair center employing 
29,000 military and civilian workers. Rep. Thomas M. Foglietta, (D-Pa.) has 
scheduled a press conference for Friday to protest the plan to close the 
shipyard.

ONE GERMANY: U.S. UNFAZED, EUROPEANS FRET

Americans are not worried about the prospect of a reunified Germany once again 
dominating Europe, but the notion scares people in Poland and concerns the 
British and French, according to a survey conducted jointly by The Times Poll 
and The Economist. 
</P>
<P>
In the abstract, Americans and the French overwhelmingly favor the idea of 
reuniting West Germany and East Germany nearly 45 years after the crushing 
defeat of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. But the British are less enthusiastic, 
and the Poles are split on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The poll posed identical questions to people in the United States, Great 
Britain, France and Poland. It was clear from the survey that the wounds of 
Nazism have not healed in Poland, whose invasion by Germany more than a 
half-century ago ignited World War II. 
</P>
<P>
And varying responses in the United States, Great Britain and France indicated 
that it will not be easy for Western leaders with political antennas to reach 
agreement on the future of the two Germanys because citizen views on the 
subject differ from nation to nation. 
</P>
<P>
For this transatlantic project, The Times Poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, 
interviewed 1,160 American adults by telephone last Saturday. During an 
overlapping four-day period, The Economist, a British newsmagazine, conducted 
interviews by telephone with 504 adults in Britain, 511 in France and 502 in 
Poland. The margin of error for the U.S. portion of the survey is four 
percentage points in either direction. For each of the three European 
countries, the error margin is five points. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive issue of German reunification has been a prime topic for world 
leaders, academicians and journalists since pro-democracy movements last year 
began tearing down the Iron Curtain and toppling Communist regimes of the 
Soviet Bloc, including East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
When ordinary citizens in the four surveyed nations were asked whether they 
believe the two Germanys should be reunited, 61% of the people in both the 
United States and France favored the idea. No more than 15% were opposed. But 
in Britain, the concept was favored by just 45% to 30%. And the Poles were 
statistically split, with 41% in favor and 44% opposed. (The rest were neutral 
or didn't know.) 
</P>
<P>
Reunifying Germany in theory is one thing. But if that country should 
subsequently emerge as the most powerful nation in Europe, then this prospect 
bothers the Europeans who suffered from German military ambitions and Nazi 
atrocities in World Wars I and II. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Poles, 69% said they would "worry" about a reunified Germany becoming 
"the dominant power in Europe." Only 25% would not worry. In both Britain and 
France, a dominant Germany would disturb 50% of those surveyed. It would not 
bother 37% of the British and 43% of the French. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Americans seemed rather blase about the idea of Germany again 
dominating Europe. It concerned only 29% and posed no problem for 62%. 
</P>
<P>
What worried the Poles most about a dominant Germany was the possibility that 
it "may try to expand its territory again" or "lead to a revival of Nazism." 
The British also feared a resurgence of Nazism. The chief concern of the 
French, on the other hand, was that "the German economy may become too strong." 
</P>
<P>
One of the stickiest questions to be answered about possible reunification is 
where the new Germany would fit militarily. With West Germany now providing the 
front lines for NATO and East Germany serving as the forward outpost for the 
Warsaw Pact, reunification would dramatically alter the European military map. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles, by a margin of roughly 5 to 3, said a reunified Germany should avoid 
any military pact and be neutral, presumably like Austria. 
</P>
<P>
People in France -- which is not a member of NATO but is an integral part of 
the Western military alliance -- believed by a 4-to-3 margin that a reunified 
Germany should belong to NATO. In the two surveyed NATO countries -- the United 
States and Great Britain -- citizens, by roughly 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 
respectively, advocated making a reunified Germany a member of their alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans and British wanted to keep the U.S. military at its present 
strength in Europe. More than 300,000 U.S. troops now are based there. The 
French and Poles, however, were split on this question. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who oppose reducing U.S. forces, the Americans, British and French 
view these troops principally as a means of maintaining the Atlantic Alliance 
and providing the defense against potential Soviet aggression. But the Poles 
have another reason, one rooted in the history of Central Europe. They believe 
the U.S. military is needed "to help offset Germany's new power" if 
reunification becomes reality. 
</P>
<P>
People in all four surveyed countries believe overwhelmingly that the European 
Community -- the 12 Western European nations that have formed a powerful 
economic bloc -- should accept new members from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, where Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement sparked an anti-Communist 
revolution, appeared to be supremely confident that democratic reforms will 
survive in Eastern Europe regardless of whether Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev manages to hold on to power. Nearly three-fourths of the Poles felt 
the reforms will stay with or without Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
But people in the Western countries were not so sure. The French tended to 
believe that the new reforms are sufficiently entrenched to survive without 
Gorbachev. But the Americans were divided on the question, and most of the 
British thought the fates of the reforms and the Soviet leader are intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
Among those surveyed, 6 in 10 of the Poles and French, slightly more than half 
the British and 4 in 10 of the Americans said a relative either had been killed 
or wounded in one of the world wars. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles and French directly affected by the wars were slightly less 
supportive of German reunification than were people whose families had escaped 
harm. But family war histories did not seem to make a difference in the 
attitudes of Americans and the British. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you favor or oppose reunification of Germany?

An apparently deranged gunman died in a barrage of bullets at the Montclair 
police station Thursday after allegedly taking a secretary hostage, demanding 
to talk to the police chiefand the U.S. Marines and firing a shot at a 
plainclothes sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was identified as Adrian Mark Vasquez, 27. He was a resident of 
Montclair, 35 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez was killed when six policemen opened fire on him just inside the front 
door of the station after he fired a shot from a .38-caliber revolver that 
missed the plainclothes officer and smashed through a window, Police Lt. Terry 
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dead when he hit the floor," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Vasquez's family said he had "mental problems from . . . drugs" and 
that he had told a nephew on Wednesday that he was "going to kill a cop," 
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez had previously been in trouble with the law for drug and traffic 
violations, Gibson said, but details were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities said they do not know why Vasquez demanded to talk 
to Police Chief Gregory Caldwell or the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"He was acting incoherently," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The short drama in the neat, white, one-story station on a quiet street began 
about 8 a.m. when a police secretary, who was not identified, arrived at work 
and was followed by Vasquez through a security door for authorized personnel, 
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gibson's account, Vasquez took the secretary hostage at gunpoint 
and accompanied her to Caldwell's office, which was vacant. He then demanded 
that she phone the chief, as well as the U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary instead called the police dispatcher, who alerted other officers. 
After a brief telephone conversation with Caldwell, who was in a conference 
room in another part of the building, Vasquez stepped into the hall, saw a 
plainclothes officer and fired a shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez then walked through the security door, saw more officers, raised his 
revolver and was cut down in the lobby by police gunfire, Gibson said.

DISASTER RELIEF SOUGHT FOR CITIES HIT HARD BY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the National Commission on AIDS said Thursday the panel will seek 
emergency disaster relief money for the cities hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic 
because of inadequate federal, state and local funding. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members meeting in Los Angeles said they would seek congressional 
support for a bill that would provide emergency funding -- similar to relief 
provided for communities crippled by earthquakes, floods and hurricanes -- for 
Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Newark and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of all the reported cases of people infected with the AIDS virus in 
the United States are in those metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Because AIDS is a disaster -- a human disaster," said Dr. June E. Osborn, 
chairwoman of the commission, "it's quite clear the areas that have been 
hardest hit are in need of more funding." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a member of the commission, said he will sponsor 
legislation that seeks matching funds from each of the states involved for AIDS 
relief money. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, a panel created to advise Congress and President Bush on the 
nation's AIDS epidemic, is on a three-day fact-finding tour of Los Angeles to 
gauge the depth of the AIDS crisis here. During an all-day hearing at the 
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, the commission heard testimony from more than 30 
health care workers, AIDS specialists and activists, who described problems 
HIV-infected patients have in seeking medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was its first outside the nation's capital since the panel was 
formed last year. Eunice Diaz, a professor at the USC School of Medicine and a 
member of the panel, said she lobbied for the local hearing "because L.A.'s 
position with regard to the AIDS crisis needs to be acknowledged on a national 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
Several commission members said they were stunned by the lack of AIDS treatment 
facilities and health care funding in Los Angeles. Commission member Scott 
Allen said he was "surprised at the lack of compassion here," evidenced by the 
fact that the county Health Department provides only one 22-bed AIDS inpatient 
clinic in an area with the nation's second-highest total of reported AIDS 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, county Health Department chief, told the panel the county is 
handcuffed by inadequate state funding, and that he has tried to find 
alternatives to inpatient care. The 1990 county budget includes $60 million for 
AIDS, he said, but a host of speakers said that is a relatively small amount 
and blasted the county for failing to allocate more. Members of ACT/UP, an AIDS 
activist group, held up signs such as "U R Wasting AIDS $" during Gates' 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, AIDS coordinator for the city of Los Angeles, said most of the 
AIDS health care is now being provided by community health clinics and 
criticized local elected officials for failing to enact proper AIDS education 
and prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to tell people about safe sex, and we've got to tell people about 
clean needles or we're going to have a lot of dead bodies out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other officials from San Diego, Orange and San Bernardino counties 
cited a lack of resources and AIDS facilities available for HIV-infected people 
in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The thread that's run through here is that there is a shocking absence of 
programs for sick and dying people in Los Angeles and the rest of the state," 
said Dr. David E. Rogers, vice chairman of the commission. "We on this 
committee are building to fight for more federal money, but here is one of the 
wealthiest states in the nation, and it's not paying for these critical 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
The panel, in a letter to President Bush last month, asked the Administration 
to recognize "that a crisis situation exists in many cities that will require 
extraordinary measures." The commission is scheduled to send a report on the 
nation's AIDS crisis to the White House by August.

STATE HIGH COURT ALLOWS WOMAN TO SUE PRIVATE CLUB FOR SEX BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court on Thursday opened the way for women and 
minorities denied membership in a private country club to sue for 
discrimination under the state civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, the justices refused to hear claims by attorneys for a 
Northern California golf club that it was not a "business establishment" 
subject to the anti-discrimination provisions of the civil rights law, known as 
the Unruh Act. 
</P>
<P>
The club also argued that government intrusion into its membership policies 
that would prohibit it from barring women threatened its members' 
constitutional rights to privacy and free association. 
</P>
<P>
Only Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas voted to hear a bid to overturn a 
trailblazing decision last October by a state Court of Appeal that gave a legal 
green light to a suit by a Hillsborough woman against the Peninsula Golf and 
Country Club in San Mateo County. Four votes from the seven-member court are 
required to grant review. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court ruling now becomes binding on trial courts throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Kane of Redwood City, the club's attorney, said an appeal to the U.S. 
Supreme Court would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"When the government seeks to override the rights of free association, I view 
this as pretty fascistic," he said. "We now have examples in Eastern Europe of 
what happens when the government tries to tell you how to run your life." 
</P>
<P>
The state high court's action was welcomed by Kevin R. McLean, who represents 
Mary Ann Warfield in her suit against the club. Permitting such suits will 
force discriminatory country clubs to revise their policies or become 
"cloistered groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Peninsula club "should get into the 20th Century and allow 
women to have full membership." 
</P>
<P>
Warfield, a real estate agent and ardent golfer, filed her suit when her family 
membership in the club was revoked after she and her husband divorced. Under 
club rules, full membership may be held only in the name of an adult male. She 
asked for a court order barring the club from terminating her rights and 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contended that the membership revocation violated Unruh Act provisions 
barring discrimination by business establishments in California on the basis of 
sex, race, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
Warfield said that despite its contentions, the club was essentially a business 
-- operating a restaurant, bar and recreational facilities for members and 
guests that also were leased or rented to outsiders. The fact that the dues for 
some members were paid by employers further proved the club was used for 
business contacts and activities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Mateo Superior Court judge dismissed her suit, but last fall an appeals 
court in San Francisco reinstated the case, saying the club could be deemed a 
business establishment -- and thus covered by the Unruh Act -- if the club had 
"businesslike characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
Warfield must be allowed an opportunity to prove her claim that the club was 
not truly private but instead a business -- and that she was the victim of 
unlawful discrimination, the appellate panel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Club's Argument 
</P>
<P>
In their petition to the state Supreme Court, lawyers for the club argued that 
the Legislature never intended the Unruh Act to be applied to "truly private" 
organizations, such as the club. 
</P>
<P>
They sought to contrast the country club with organizations like the Rotary 
Club, a group with nearly 20,000 members that the courts have deemed a business 
and thus subject to anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing suits against private social and recreational groups like the country 
club would threaten the "very existence" of fraternities, sororities, all-male 
or all-female schools and religious and ethnic groups, the club lawyers said.

2 OFFICERS CHARGED WITH ROBBING 3 ALIENS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego police officers were arrested Thursday and charged with kidnaping 
and robbing three Latino illegal aliens while patrolling the downtown area in 
two separate incidents last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf later appeared in San Diego 
Municipal Court where, dressed in dark blue jail garb, they entered not-guilty 
pleas to five felony counts each of kidnaping, kidnaping for robbery, and 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officers were not charged with assaulting the three undocumented 
workers, a court affidavit filed in the case alleges that Hoff swung his 
flashlight and struck one of the migrant workers in the testicles, then pushed 
him into a puddle of water. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Timothy W. Tower ordered the officers held without bail, at 
least until a bail review hearing can be held this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, whom police officials said were fired Thursday, did not speak 
during the brief court appearance. But their defense attorneys blasted the 
district attorney's office for carrying out a "vendetta" against the officers 
and for not having the courage to recognize that the charges were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys contended that the victims cannot be trusted, noting that 
one of them is currently in jail in El Cajon on theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
"These officers are totally devastated. They couldn't understand why these 
charges were brought," said Everett Bobbitt, Schaaf's attorney. "They're both 
married, with kids. They both have roots in this community." 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Pent, a deputy prosecutor in the district attorney's special 
operations unit, said his office had no hidden agenda in bringing the case 
against the policemen. 
</P>
<P>
Both officers, assigned to the Central Area station which covers the downtown 
district, are white, a fact that some San Diego civil rights activists pointed 
to in alleging that racial discrimination against Latino migrants is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"These are Latinos being attacked by white people," said activist Roberto 
Martinez, who described the incidents as "hate crimes" perpetrated by law 
officers. "There's just too much of this going on, people taking advantage of 
illegals because of their status and the color of their skin." 
</P>
<P>
But police spokesman Capt. Dick Toneck said the case is evidence that the 
police are tough on officers who allegedly abuse minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to tolerate this kind of conduct from our officers," he said. 
"And no officers on our department will condone this kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, according to an affidavit filed in court by police 
investigators, Hoff and Schaaf stopped Rolando Carrera-Reyes, 23, in the early 
morning of Aug. 4. They searched him and took his wallet, according to the 
affidavit, removing $25 and a medical identification card. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoff struck Carrera-Reyes twice in the testicles with the flashlight," the 
affidavit said. "Both officers swore at Carrera-Reyes." 
</P>
<P>
The second incident allegedly occurred a week later, when the two officers 
stopped Javier Perez-Gonzalez and Ramiro Rodriguez, both 21. 
</P>
<P>
The migrants said the officers ordered them into their patrol car and drove 
them to another downtown location, where Hoff took $41, some loose change and a 
cigarette lighter from Perez-Gonzalez. Later, Rodriguez said, he was robbed by 
Schaaf of about $100 and a black comb.

MANDELA URGES TALKS TO PLAN FOR 'A NEW ERA';

SOUTH AFRICA: THE JAILED BLACK LEADER STILL BACKS ARMED STRUGGLE. BUT HE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jailed black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, in his first major policy statement 
since his trial 26 years ago, has reiterated his commitment to the armed 
liberation struggle "as a legitimate form of self-defense," but he says he 
wants to bring the African National Congress and the white minority-led 
government to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy document, published Thursday by the left-wing Cape Town weekly 
South, offers rare insight into the thinking of Mandela, the 71-year-old leader 
of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Mandela say the document was written last year, presented to 
Pieter W. Botha, who was then the president of South Africa, at their meeting 
in July and later read to anti-apartheid leaders who visited Mandela in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, hope to see the 
ANC and the government working closely together to lay the foundations for a 
new era in our country, in which racial discrimination and prejudice, coercion 
and confrontation, death and destruction, will be forgotten," Mandela says, 
according to the text published in South. He urges the government to seize the 
opportunity without delay. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has since written another, secret peace proposal for his colleagues in 
the outlawed ANC. This proposal, described as a 10-point peace plan, is under 
consideration by the ANC's national executive at its exile headquarters in 
Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to be released within weeks from Victor Verster Prison, 
where he is serving a life sentence for sabotage. Justice Minister Kobie 
Coetsee, in an interview this week, said the government intends to free Mandela 
and that the only question is "when and under what circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Thursday, anti-apartheid leaders made public a letter 
from Mandela in which he said the ANC remains committed to nationalizing banks, 
mines and monopoly industries. Any change in that policy is inconceivable, 
Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was published by leaders of the United Democratic Front, an 
anti-apartheid coalition with close ties to the ANC. Front spokesman Patrick 
Lekota said Mandela wanted to clarify his position on economic issues because 
of suggestions that he and the external ANC leadership are in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"Black economic empowerment is a goal we fully support and encourage, but in 
our situation state control of certain sectors of the economy is unavoidable," 
Mandela said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
In the policy statement published by South, Mandela said he was "acting on my 
own initiative, in the hope that the (ANC) will, in due course, endorse my 
action." 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his decision to urge the government to negotiate with the ANC 
was not an attempt at negotiation, and said, "Negotiation on political matters 
is literally a matter of life and death which (must) be handled by the (ANC) 
itself through its appointed representatives." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "My task is a very limited one, and that is to bring the country's 
two major political bodies to the negotiating table. No prisoner, irrespective 
of his status or influence, can conduct negotiations of this nature from 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure what role the country's most-respected political prisoner 
will play in the liberation movement once he is released. Mandela has described 
himself as "a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC," and he has been meeting 
with government leaders since 1986. Sources in the anti-apartheid movement say 
Mandela will probably form part of its negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised to create a climate for 
negotiations, and a detailed plan is expected when Parliament convenes next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and his Cabinet are seeking ways to lift the 30-year ban on the ANC.

PRAIA, Cape Verde 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of a pilgrimage to some of the poorest nations on Earth, Pope John 
Paul II on Thursday asked the world community not to overlook Africa in its 
preoccupation with sudden change in East Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff winds and blowing sand greeted the Pope in this tiny island nation 300 
miles off West Africa as he began an eight-day journey to five sub-Saharan 
countries where per-capita income averages less than $220 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic crowds waving white and yellow papal flags lined freshly tarred 
roads to welcome John Paul to Praia, a city of 60,000 people and national 
capital of this Rhode Island-size country. About 90% of Cape Verde's 364,000 
people are Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the biggest day in Cape Verde's history," a diplomat in the 
receiving line said. 
</P>
<P>
In the golden days of sail, Cape Verde seamen, the descendants of Portuguese 
colonists and African slaves, served as crewmen on board New Bedford whalers 
and Yankee clippers. Today, many Cape Verdeans live in Rhode Island and 
southern Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
En route from Rome on his sixth visit to Africa and the 45th foreign journey of 
his 11 years as Pope, the 69-year-old pontiff seemed relaxed and fully 
recovered from a bout with the flu. He chatted with reporters, offering an 
insider's glimpse of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the 
Vatican last month. He said Gorbachev had applauded the concept of prayer, and 
he added: 
</P>
<P>
"I can say without betraying any personal secret that (Gorbachev) was very 
pleased with the Pope's prayers. He said prayer was certainly a sign of 
spiritual order, spiritual values, and that we have great need of these 
values." 
</P>
<P>
After two days in Cape Verde, John Paul will visit four countries on the 
African continent -- Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad. 
</P>
<P>
"This trip is especially dear to me," he said, "because we are going to meet 
the poor in a desert region often called the Sahel. They are poor in an 
economic, material sense. In a moral sense, poverty means wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, the Pope said that developed countries working to 
solidify changed East-West relations must maintain their economic commitment to 
the have-not nations of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
"They cannot abandon their common and current responsibilities . . . for the 
problems of the Third World," he said, "and for this I also thank providence 
that at this time my journey is taking me precisely to Africa, to the Sahelian 
countries. This is an act of providence." 
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony, has no natural resources, yet it is the 
richest of the five countries John Paul will visit. Per capita income is about 
$400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Its economy is tied to subsistence agriculture on islands subjected to 
prolonged droughts, and its people rely on foreign aid and remittances from 
relatives living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, making the first of two African trips scheduled for 1990, asserted on 
arrival his oft-expressed conviction that for there to be a just world, the 
rich must help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holy See and the Pope feel allied with Africa and other countries of the 
Third World because we must present to the rich all the needs of the poor," he 
told reporters. "We must insist on solutions. It's a question of solutions of 
an individual and concrete type. How can you not cry out in certain 
situations?" 
</P>
<P>
John Paul is scheduled to fly this morning to the island of Mindelo, then move 
on Saturday to Guinea-Bissau, his second stop.

CUBA HALTS ANGOLA TROOP PULLOUT OVER REBEL ATTACK

Cuba on Thursday blamed the United States for a rebel attack on its troops in 
Angola last weekend and temporarily suspended the withdrawal of its forces from 
the African country. 
</P>
<P>
The decision halted a Cuban pullout of soldiers and equipment from Angola that 
has been under way since January, 1989, as part of regional peace accords 
between Angola, South Africa and Cuba. Under the agreement, South Africa halted 
support for the Angolan rebels and agreed to a U.N.-supervised independence 
plan for Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel organization, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
(UNITA), which is backed by the United States, said it regretted the incident. 
It said the Cubans failed to let the rebels know where Cuban troops were 
located. 
</P>
<P>
Four Cubans were killed and five injured in Sunday's raid on a water 
purification plant guarded by Cuban troops in southwest Angola, about 250 miles 
south of Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's announcement put a hitch in the complex peace process, but it seemed 
unlikely to lead to a full-scale breakdown of the accords, Western diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba has already brought home more than 31,000 of its 50,000 troops from 
Angola, where they were helping the Marxist government fight UNITA, headed by 
Jonas Savimbi. The rest of the Cubans are to leave by mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba said the suspension would stay in effect until it is satisfied that UNITA 
will not harass withdrawing Cuban forces or try to disrupt the peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility for these criminal actions by UNITA against Cuban troops and 
for the sabotage of the peace accords which they imply ultimately lies with the 
U.S. government, the logistical backer and political adviser of UNITA," the 
Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department noted that Cuba was ahead of schedule on 
its troop withdrawal and said it will seek to clarify Havana's decision to 
suspend the pullout.

FBI SEARCHES LAKE AT HOME OF JUNK DEALER; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: AGENTS STILL REFUSE TO CALL O'FERRELL A SUSPECT. HE STOPS 
COOPERATING WITH OFFICERS AND HIRES AN ATTORNEY.

Federal authorities Thursday began dragging a lake for evidence in the 
investigation of mail bombings in the South, and a junk dealer who had been 
questioned extensively by the FBI hired an attorney and quit cooperating with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The junk dealer, Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, continued to protest that he is 
innocent. No charges have been filed in the case, in which a federal judge in 
Birmingham and a civil rights attorney in Georgia were killed by bombs last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for the fourth straight day, investigators scoured O'Ferrell's property 
for evidence while publicly refusing even to designate him a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of a number of people we are talking to," FBI spokesman Chuck Archer 
said earlier this week. Other sources said privately, however, that O'Ferrell 
was suspected of involvement and showed deception on the polygraph test 
administered earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Amid signs of increasing frustration at the lengthy interrogations and constant 
media attention, O'Ferrell Thursday hired attorney Paul Harden, who said he is 
a family friend. "The involvement and the length of time the FBI has been here 
probably caused him some concern," said Harden. 
</P>
<P>
Harden told reporters he believed O'Ferrell had been "too cooperative" with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything that he has done at this time to incriminate himself," 
Harden said, adding, "I don't believe that he's guilty of anything." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer talked to reporters in front of O'Ferrell's house in New Brockton, 
in view of divers searching the 15-acre lake across a narrow dirt road from the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The divers, who said they were told to look for unnatural objects on the lake 
bottom, said the job may take several days. 
</P>
<P>
Already FBI agents and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
had spent three days searching O'Ferrell's home and a surplus store and 
warehouse he operated. They also pumped the contents of two septic tanks in a 
search for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Atlanta Constitution quoted an unnamed source as saying 
new information had established a "possible link" between O'Ferrell and Bryan 
Joseph Fleming, an Enterprise man who was indicted in Montgomery earlier this 
month on gun-exportation conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
Harden told reporters that he knew of no connection between O'Ferrell and 
Fleming, who was indicted along with Charles Farrell Malone of San Francisco 
after a 33-month undercover investigation by the U.S. Customs Service and ATF. 
</P>
<P>
They both pleaded innocent to the charge of conspiring to export firearms 
without federal authorization and are free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities earlier had speculated that the bombings were racially motivated. A 
source close to the investigation said this week, though, that other factors 
may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are going to be surprised," the source said. "When this is 
over with I don't think it's going to be your classic racial bombing." 
</P>
<P>
The hunt for the bomber began after federal Judge Robert S. Vance was killed by 
a mail bomb Dec. 16 at his home in suburban Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Robinson, a black civil rights lawyer and NAACP official in Savannah, 
Ga., was killed two days later by another exploding package, and similar mail 
bombs were defused at the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, where Vance served, 
and at the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People office in 
Jacksonville, Fla.

FOR L.A. AREA, DRUG AID MAY BE DROP IN BUCKET; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: LITTLE OF EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDS IS LIKELY TO REACH THE OFFICERS IN THE 
STREETS. ADDICTS MAY RECEIVE MORE HELP.

<P>
For a year now, Los Angeles area officials have been lobbying for more federal 
drug-fighting funds and designation as a "high-intensity" drug trafficking 
center, using as ammunition everything from a record $100 million in cash 
seizures to the astounding discovery of 21 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the officials finally got the designation they wanted, but the 
reaction was mixed -- their enthusiasm tempered by lack of a specific list of 
the help they will get and debate over whether a special $25-million fund to be 
shared by five target areas nationwide is merely a "drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
And, hours after President Bush outlined his $10.6-billion anti-drug plan, a 
group of police officers at one of Los Angeles' drug "supermarkets" wondered 
whether any of it would filter down to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of all, we need new radios," said Sgt. Dave Cullen, part of a Los Angeles 
police narcotics crew making one of its periodic sweeps through MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although few details of the plan were released, it appeared that little if any 
of the funds would go directly to local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, officials said 300 additional agents and support personnel would be 
added to Los Angeles offices of federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement 
Administration and Customs Service, and 694 positions would be added in the 
vast "Border States region," which includes San Diego and Imperial counties in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted the creation of more task forces combining DEA agents with 
officers from local agencies to tackle problems such as street gang drug 
traffickers, clandestine desert landing strips used by smugglers and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, California should get thousands more "treatment slots" for drug 
addicts and "a substantial portion" of 75 new federal judgeships called for 
under the Bush Administration's overall anti-drug plan, according to Chauncey 
Veatch, chairman of the Governor's Policy Council on Drug and Alcohol Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether $25 million appears to be a drop in the bucket or not, we are 
grateful," Veatch said. "The announcement is something we have long awaited . . 
. . This will be the area of America where the war is fought. Our opportunity 
for more resources down the road will grow." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) called the funding "woefully 
inadequate," adding, "I really wish the Administration had done this a year 
ago. We've lost a lot of ground while the 'drug czar' (William J. Bennett) 
studied what was patently obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal plan, Los Angeles and the four other target zones -- the 
border area, New York, Miami and Houston -- would get increased funding in two 
ways: first, through a yet-undetermined split of the $25 million along with up 
to $21 million more from the federal asset forfeiture fund; and second, through 
increases in the regular federal budget for law enforcement agencies, treatment 
programs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
In the second category, the Los Angeles area would receive $169 million in 
fiscal 1991, 11% more than the current $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
In citing Los Angeles as one of the target areas, the 142-page National Drug 
Control Strategy called it "a major entry and transshipment point for cocaine, 
Asian and Mexican heroin and marijuana" and the base of street gangs that sell 
drugs around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The precise boundaries of the target areas are still to be determined, the 
report said, "through consultation with local officials," and this area "could 
include Los Angeles County and Orange County, and all the municipalities 
therein." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," said Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, who had pushed for 
inclusion in such a zone and was in Washington to attend a White House briefing 
on the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals mentioned in the report's discussion of the target zone 
along the Mexican border was one to improve or redesign the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service border checkpoint on the San Diego Freeway south of San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Justice Department would be named to coordinate the 
distribution of funds in each of the target areas except the border, where a 
Treasury Department official would preside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have waged a sustained campaigned for more federal aid, 
spotlighting the city's growing role as a drug-trafficking center and 
complaining of an East Coast bias in allocation of drug-fighting funds. State 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp belittled federal aid proposals by comparing 
them to someone offering help with a garden hose while his neighbor's house is 
burning down. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles campaign got a boost in August, when a report by U.S. Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh described an alliance between the Colombian drug cartels 
and Los Angeles street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 29, the Department of Justice awarded California $39.7 million in 
anti-drug funds, nearly four times the amount granted the previous year, with 
64% going to cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
In MacArthur Park, there was little time to ponder what it all would mean after 
a caravan of five police cars descended Thursday afternoon on a popular crack 
dealing spot. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this here," said Sgt. Raul Amescua, pulling a wad of bills -- $693 in 
all -- from the pants pocket of a 22-year-old suspect. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of transients, some with shopping carts and garbage bags with their 
belongings, watched as two rows of men and women stood with their hands behind 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Some waited anxiously for the policemen to leave so they could "tweek," 
scrounge the ground for rocks of cocaine dropped during the raid and overlooked 
by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people here are down and out. They're addicted and they need a 
place to go," Amescua said. Without major increases in treatment programs, he 
predicted, "most of them will live their lives just the way they're living it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But one onlooker, a 27-year-old transient originally from New York, said there 
was nothing the government could do to change his addiction to "hitting the 
pipe." 
</P>
<P>
"Treatment centers just let your mind sleep," he said. Then you wake up one day 
"and you have to have it." 
</P>
<P>
As the officers pulled away, he joined two dozen others in a frenzied search 
along the ground.

FLU CASES REACH EPIDEMIC STAGE; DEATH TOLL RISES

This winter's flu season has reached the epidemic stage, with a key indicator 
-- a deaths-from-flu index -- at its highest level in at least eight years, 
researchers with the Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen states are reporting "widespread" flu problems, and 17 more, including 
California, are reporting "regional" outbreaks, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
To judge the severity of a flu season, CDC researchers track how many deaths 
are attributable to influenza or pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 7.6% of 15,090 deaths reported to the CDC from 121 major cities were 
blamed on flu or pneumonia, and that "significantly exceeds" expected levels 
for the second straight week, said Dr. Walter Gunn, a CDC viral disease 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"This qualifies in our definition as an epidemic," Gunn said, adding that the 
7.6% mark is the worst weekly mark in records dating back to the winter of 
1981-82. The CDC's epidemic definition is a ratio of 6.7% of deaths or above. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms our earlier concerns that this would be a worse-than-average 
year," Gunn said. CDC researchers feared a serious flu season when case reports 
started coming in last fall several weeks earlier than usual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the flu cases reported to the CDC this winter have been the type which 
researchers call A-H3N2. That was the predominant type in the 1984-85 flu 
season, when an estimated 57,000 Americans died from flu -- 37,000 more than in 
the typical winter, Gunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as how many people will die" this flu season, "that depends on how long 
this peak is sustained," Gunn said. "With any luck, it will come right back 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 18 states -- up from 10 the week before -- reported what the CDC 
terms "widespread" flu activity: outbreaks of flu or flu-like illness in 
counties combining for more than half of a state's population.

<P>
Sixteen-year-old "Trinch," as he is known, stood with three friends on the 
front steps of Cardozo High School, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his 
Windbreaker, the black baseball cap on his head tilted in a jaunty angle to one 
side. Under the cap, however, his face was cold and angry. 
</P>
<P>
He cursed at the mention of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gonna tell us not to use drugs and not to sell 'em -- and he's doing it 
himself?" he said, spitting out the words. "They think they're gonna stop the 
drug problem, but they can't, they just can't." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, three days after FBI agents arrested him for allegedly smoking crack 
cocaine, Barry flew to Florida to begin treatment at the Hanley-Hazelden Center 
in West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who said Sunday that he wanted to begin to "heal my body, mind and 
soul," has not publicly acknowledged a drug abuse problem. His press secretary 
has said his most serious difficulty is with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teens Are Furious 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers all over this city are hurt and furious over what they consider a 
personal betrayal by a black role model they admired. Many of them have heard 
Barry lecture numerous times in their schools about the evils of drug use, all 
the time denying that he himself had ever used them. "My mind's too sharp, my 
body's too precious, to foul it with drugs," he has told them. 
</P>
<P>
Katina Morris, 16, an 11th grader, could barely hide her disgust. "He should 
have come out and told people that he had a problem instead of lying to 
everyone for so long," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going around preaching," Tracey Parker, 17, said. "But he was doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction among Washington's young people, who identified strongly with the 
city's mayor, has been intense. It is hardly surprising, considering that 
Washington -- with its high rate of drug-related murders -- has become a symbol 
of the nation's drug scourge. 
</P>
<P>
Even President Bush, speaking with a group of newspaper publishers Thursday, 
referred to young people when asked about Barry's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what, my thought went to the kids, the kids in the schools," he said. 
"It's a matter of sadness, and Barbara shares my view on that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on Youth 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many drug abuse experts and inner-city youth workers predicted 
that Barry's arrest last week on crack cocaine charges will not have a 
long-term negative impact on young people trying to break out of the cycle of 
poverty, violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many specialists said Barry's troubles ultimately could have a 
positive influence, particularly on the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
When a powerful, successful and famous individual is found to have a substance 
abuse problem, "people begin to look at themselves," said Dr. Beny Prim, 
associate administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"If he goes into treatment, then they begin to seek treatment, too," said Prim, 
who also runs the Addiction Research and Treatment Corp., a drug treatment 
program in New York. "And, when the treatment works, and he comes back to talk, 
he will be even more effective." 
</P>
<P>
Experts who work in inner-city social programs said that studies of black 
adolescents have shown that they look to the people closest to them as role 
models -- parents, friends, clergy, Big Brothers, even their local drug pushers 
-- rather than to famous black people. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are much more powerful role models than other figures," said Dr. 
Jessica Daniel, a Boston psychologist who works with the Judge Baker Center, a 
private child guidance clinic associated with Harvard University. "Those are 
the individuals from whom they derive a sense of what it means to be an African 
American." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Barry's predicament is unlikely to inflict a sense of despair 
among young people outside the nation's capital. And even among Washington's 
teen-agers, many experts predicted that the anger initially expressed toward 
Barry would fade and eventually turn into sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the role model thing is terribly misunderstood and overblown in 
America," said Primus Mootry, executive director of the Better Boys Foundation, 
a private community social agency that works with disadvantaged children in an 
inner-city Chicago neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids in poor communities get involved in drugs because their peers are doing 
drugs, because the pusher is in the neighborhood," Mootry said. "The pusher is 
a far more significant role model. These kids aren't going to suddenly lose 
hope because of something Marion Barry did. 
</P>
<P>
"For an athlete to come to an inner-city school and make a talk and drive off 
-- that's wonderful," he added. "But let's not confuse that with the fact that 
these kids are living day to day with difficult circumstances. One of the ways 
in which we trivialize the plight of children in our inner cities is by saying 
cutesy little things like they need role models. They need a better family 
environment, food, clothing, shelter and a decent education." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behavior Called Denial 
</P>
<P>
For many teen-agers, the most difficult aspect of the Barry affair is his 
apparent hypocrisy -- publicly taking an anti-drug stance while allegedly using 
drugs himself. But addiction specialists pointed out that Barry was probably 
engaging in denial, which is considered classic behavior for someone with a 
substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the mayor saw himself as a hypocrite in what he was doing," Prim 
said. "Possibly, it was denial, which is part of the disease. It's not unusual. 
Doctors go out and talk about smoking, but still smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Dupont, a psychiatrist and former director of the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse, said that most teen-agers are at one time or another 
disappointed by someone they respect. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the parent who says 'do as I say, not as I do,' but wisdom and love 
have to go beyond thinking that the people you care about have all the answers 
and do everything right," he said. "They can identify with the mayor better now 
because he is so visibly imperfect. I'm not sure that that's going to be bad. 
Even inner-city kids can forgive." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts said that each time a celebrity is revealed to have a substance 
abuse problem, the public receives a strong anti-drug message. Among others, 
they cited former Washington Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley, who was 
suspended from the team after failing a drug test, and the cocaine-related 
death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, who died in June, 
1986, after the Boston Celtics drafted him.

Medical students, who can best serve their future patients if they become 
humane and caring physicians, frequently suffer severe verbal, psychological or 
even physical abuse from their superiors that warps their professional 
development, according to two pioneering surveys of students being published 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The separate surveys of about 500 students, conducted at the University of 
Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and the University of South Florida 
College of Medicine in Tampa, document an "obvious" problem that needs to be 
solved, according to Dr. DeWitt C. Baldwin Jr., director of the American 
Medical Assn.'s division of medical education research. Baldwin said the 
findings are buttressed by similar data collected on another 700 students in 
yet-to-be-published surveys at 10 other medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The physician who has been treated in this manner may well carry over those 
attitudes and behaviors to their patients and students," said Baldwin, who was 
a co-author of the Florida study. 
</P>
<P>
Publication of the studies comes at a critical time for the nation's 126 
medical schools. Over the last decade, the annual number of applicants for 
approximately 17,000 first-year slots has plummeted from 36,727 in 1981 to 
26,915 in 1989, according to the Assn. of American Medical Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in applicants has been attributed to many factors. These range from 
the dehumanizing aspects of medical school and residency training to limits on 
fees, fear of malpractice suits and a widespread perception of public 
disenchantment with the profession. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to attract well-adjusted and talented young people to medical 
school, we can ill afford to have an environment that is perceived by some to 
be aversive, hostile or abusive," wrote the University of South Florida 
research team, which was led by psychiatry professors K. Harnett Sheehan and 
Dr. David W. Sheehan. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom about medical education has been that regimentation and 
discipline are more likely to produce good physicians than a "kinder, gentler" 
learning environment. Many medical students, however, do not share this 
perspective, the new studies reveal. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 431 Colorado students who responded anonymously to a 1985 
questionnaire said they had been abused at some time during medical school, 
with two-thirds describing an experience that was of "major importance and very 
upsetting." One-sixth of those reporting abuse said that the most serious 
episode would "always affect them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Florida Survey 
</P>
<P>
At the University of South Florida, one-third of the 75 third-year medical 
students surveyed in 1988 indicated that they "had considered dropping out of 
medical school," and one-fourth claimed they would have "chosen a different 
profession if they had known in advance about the extent of mistreatment they 
would experience." The third year is traditionally considered the most 
stressful because students are intensively immersed for the first time in the 
pressure-filled world of hospital practice. 
</P>
<P>
One Florida student reported "he had been kicked in the testicular region by an 
attending physician and required medical attention for his injury." 
</P>
<P>
One Colorado student being instructed in eye diagnosis techniques balked at 
examining a classmate in "obvious pain" from a corneal abrasion accidentally 
inflicted by another student. "When I explained this to the supervising 
physician, he said, 'Oh good, this gives us an opportunity to learn how to 
force a patient to cooperate even if they are in pain.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another Colorado student was hit so hard on the knuckles with a surgical 
instrument by an attending surgeon while being taught to suture that "after the 
operation, my knuckles were bleeding, and I now have a scar on the back of my 
right hand." 
</P>
<P>
Authors of the studies acknowledged that such instances of physical abuse are 
extreme, and that the surveys may be biased because they are based on the 
students' subjective judgments about past events. But they said medical school 
faculty and administrators are unlikely to take the problem seriously unless 
egregious cases are widely publicized. In addition, they said the perception of 
significant abuse could not be explained away. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the studies, Dr. August Swanson, a vice-president of the 
American Assn. of Medical Colleges in Washington, agreed the percentages 
"reflected a problem" but added that "exactly how pervasive it might be is open 
to investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Reich, a fourth-year medical student at Emory University in Atlanta 
and president of a group of medical students that advises the medical colleges 
association, said the articles "ring very true." 
</P>
<P>
The authors called for medical schools to take remedial steps, some of which 
the Colorado and Florida schools have already taken, such as educational 
campaigns and the establishment of grievance committees, disciplinary 
procedures and confidential counseling programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out in the Open 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said that in most instances medical students now believe that "it won't 
do any good (to report abuse), and 'I would probably get screwed if I did.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry K. Silver, the principal author of the Colorado study, said, "Just 
bringing (abusive behavior) out in the open will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Martin Pops, dean of students at UCLA Medical School, cautioned that 
"what one student would interpret as abuse, other students wouldn't." He said 
it is his impression that medical student abuse is "not a major problem" at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The new studies are based on carefully designed surveys, and in this respect 
differ from anecdotal reports of medical student mistreatment and other 
information sources, such as Dr. Samuel Shem's satiric 1978 novel "The House of 
God," anthropologist and physician Dr. Melvin Konner's 1987 book "Becoming a 
Doctor," and the television series "St. Elsewhere," which was aired from 1982 
to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of the medical school studies said no comparable surveys have been 
conducted at law, dental or veterinary schools, but they speculated that 
similar problems may exist in other professions. The only other groups that 
have been "systematically studied as victims of abuse are children and battered 
wives," the University of South Florida's David Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
Abuse was defined in the Colorado study as "harmful, injurious or offensive" 
treatment, in particular "unnecessary or avoidable acts or words of a negative 
nature." Both studies differentiated between experiences that might be 
considered unavoidable parts of the education process, such as long hours and 
sleep deprivation, and other episodes, such as sexual harassment, verbal 
humiliation and unjustifiable threats of failing grades or "ruining" careers. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, of the American Medical Assn., said he has coordinated similar surveys 
within the last several years at 10 other "representative" medical schools; he 
declined to name the institutions and said there are no plans to identify the 
schools. The results, which are being prepared for publication, "are 
essentially the same," he said.

Black and Latino inmates armed with homemade knives brawled at an overcrowded 
county jail Thursday, and 12 were injured, three critically, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates retreated to their cells and order was restored after deputies entered 
the cellblock armed with electric stun guns. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl, attributed to overcrowding and racial tensions, occurred in a 
cellblock designed to hold 24 inmates, but which held 100 prisoners at the 
time, jail Cmdr. Ben McLaughlin said. A similar racially motivated fight at the 
jail 15 miles east of San Diego left four inmates injured Dec. 13.

QUAYLE COUNTRY? Orange County adores conservatives but is oddly cool toward Dan 
Quayle, according to the Quayle Quarterly. . . . That's right: It's a new East 
Coast newsletter devoted entirely to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Issue No. 1 quotes local Republican campaign pros Eileen Padberg and Harvey 
Englander. "Orange County and Dan Quayle are both white bread. There should be 
a great fit there, but there isn't," Englander said. Padberg said local 
Republicans "are loyal, but not stupid. . . . Quayle may very well be qualified 
to be president in eight years, but he will have to prove it." Mark I. Pinsky

CHINESE STUDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY EXPRESS SHOCK, FEAR OVER VETO FAILURE 
</P>

Chinese college students in Orange County expressed alarm Thursday after 
learning that the Senate upheld President Bush's veto of a bill that would have 
waived their mandatory return to China after studies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a little bit of a shock," said Han Chen, 23, a visiting Chinese 
student at Golden West College. "I'm still kind of disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 62 to 37 against Bush, four short of the two-thirds majority 
needed to override a veto. On Wednesday, the House voted 390-25 to override. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation applied to as many as 32,000 Chinese in the United States on 
"exchange visitor" visas, many of whom fear reprisals if they are sent home 
because they protested last June's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have waived a legal requirement that, upon expiration of their 
visas, students go home for two years before returning to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, through an executive order, has assured visiting students that he will 
grant them the same extensions as the bill offered, but some students at UC 
Irvine were wary of the promise. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of students here do not have a lot of confidence in how long Bush's 
directive will last," said Jeff Ge, president of UCI's Assn. of Chinese 
Students and Scholars from the People's Republic of China. "Bush said that a 
bill would be more offensive to the Chinese government. But how can a directive 
be less offensive without being less protective?" 
</P>
<P>
Further, Ge said, the defeat of the bill shows that the United States is 
"caving in" to the Chinese government's warnings that the measure's passage 
would damage Chinese-U.S. relations and threaten further student exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly gives the message that the White House values good relations with 
the Chinese government more than Chinese students here. . . . The Chinese 
government can get their way in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of UCI's 65 visiting Chinese students and 30 scholars will be immediately 
threatened, said Martha Morgan, director of international services. At least 30 
have filed or will file forms to extend their visas, and the failure of the 
bill, she said, will not change anything. 
</P>
<P>
But students said that passage of the bill would have sent a symbolic message 
to the Chinese government and other nations that the United States is committed 
to protecting human rights and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Le, another visiting student at UCI, criticized Bush and senators for 
making this a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that they were going to vote for it," he said. "This is a lot of 
partisan (politics), but we're talking about democracy and human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Le said that he fears reprisals against his family if his comments get back to 
the Chinese government, and asked that his age and major not be published. His 
mother and father, who are in China, warned him against talking to the media, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen said that such fears show the untrustworthiness of the Chinese 
government's guarantee that returning students will not be punished. 
</P>
<P>
"We never know," Chen said. "They say that they won't harm the students. But 
who knows? They change their policy every day, every year. Nobody's going to 
depend on what they said." 
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he wished some sort of compromise could have been worked out 
whereby students could be protected but both countries could continue the 
cultural exchange.

OFFICIALS FEAR U.S. DRUG WAR FUNDS INADEQUATE; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: LITTLE OF THE $10.6 BILLION IN BUSH'S PLAN APPEARS LIKELY TO REACH 
STREET OFFICERS. ADDICTS MAY RECEIVE MORE HELP.

<P>
For a year now, Los Angeles officials have been lobbying for more federal 
drug-fighting funds and designation as a "high-intensity" drug-trafficking 
center, using as ammunition everything from a record $100 million in cash 
seizures to the astounding discovery of 21 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the officials finally got the designation they wanted, but the 
reaction was mixed -- their enthusiasm tempered by lack of a specific list of 
the help they will get and debate over whether a special $25-million fund to be 
shared by five target areas nationwide is merely a "drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
And, hours after President Bush outlined his $10.6-billion anti-drug plan, a 
group of police officers at one of Los Angeles' drug "supermarkets" wondered 
whether any of it would filter down to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Most off all we need new radios," said Sgt. Dave Cullen, part of a Los Angeles 
police narcotics crew making one of its periodic sweeps through MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although few details were of the plan were released, it appeared that little if 
any of the funds would go directly to local law enforcement agencies. Instead, 
officials said 300 additional agents and support personnel would be added to 
Los Angeles offices of federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement 
Administration and Customs Service, which would benefit Orange County in its 
battle against drugs. Another 694 positions would be added in the vast "Border 
States region," which includes San Diego and Imperial counties in California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted the creation of more task forces combining DEA agents with 
officers from local agencies to tackle problems such as street gang drug 
traffickers, clandestine desert landing strips used by smugglers and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, California should get thousands more "treatment slots" for drug 
addicts and "a substantial portion" of 75 new federal judgeships called for 
under the Bush Administration's overall anti-drug plan, according to Chauncey 
Veatch, chairman of the Governor's Policy Council on Drug and Alcohol Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether $25 million appears to be a drop in the bucket or not, we are 
grateful," Veatch said. "The announcement is something we have long awaited . . 
. . This will be the area of America where the war is fought. Our opportunity 
for more resources down the road will grow." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) called the funding "woefully 
inadequate," adding, "I really wish the Administration had done this a year 
ago. We've lost a lot of ground while the 'drug czar' (William J. Bennett) 
studied what was patently obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal plan, Los Angeles and the four other target zones -- the 
border area, New York, Miami and Houston -- would get increased funding in two 
ways: first, through a yet-undetermined split of the $25 million along with up 
to $21 million more from the federal asset forfeiture fund; and second, through 
increases in the regular federal budget for law enforcement agencies, treatment 
programs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
In the second category, the Los Angeles area would receive $169 million in 
fiscal 1991, 11% more than the current $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
In citing Los Angeles as one of the target areas, the 142-page National Drug 
Control Strategy called it "a major entry and transshipment point for cocaine, 
Asian and Mexican heroin and marijuana" and the base of street gangs that sell 
drugs around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The precise boundaries of the target areas are still to be determined, the 
report said, "through consultation with local officials," and this area "could 
include Los Angeles County and Orange County, and all the municipalities 
therein." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," said Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, who had pushed for 
inclusion in such a zone and was in Washington to attend a White House briefing 
on the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give us additional federal prosecutors who can help us work these 
(drug) cases," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments were echoed by police chiefs of several Orange County cities. 
But several also expressed the hope that the money will quickly find its way to 
the local level. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good first step, but the whole aim should be to get the funds to the 
cities where the drug war is being fought," said Santa Ana Police Chief Paul 
Walters. "The money should not be funneled in to the bureaucracy alone." 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals mentioned in the report's discussion of the target zone 
along the Mexican border was one to improve or redesign the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service border checkpoint on Interstate 5 south of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Justice Department would be named to coordinate the 
distribution of funds in each of the target areas except the border, where a 
Treasury Department official would preside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have waged a sustained campaign for more federal aid, 
spotlighting the city's growing role as a drug-trafficking center and 
complaining of an East Coast bias in allocation of drug-fighting funds. State 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp belittled federal aid proposals by comparing 
them to someone offering help with a garden hose while his neighbor's house is 
burning down. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles campaign got a boost in August, when a report by U.S. Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh described an alliance between the Colombian drug cartels 
and Los Angeles street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 29, the Department of Justice awarded California $39.7 million in 
anti-drug funds, nearly four times the amount granted the previous year, with 
64% going to cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
In MacArthur Park, there was little time to ponder what it all would mean after 
a caravan of five police cars descended Thursday afternoon on a popular crack 
dealing spot. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this here," said Sgt. Raul Amescua, pulling a wad of bills -- $693 in 
all -- from the pants pocket of a 22-year-old suspect. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of transients, some with shopping carts and garbage bags with their 
belongings, watched as two rows of men and women stood with their hands behind 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Some waited anxiously for the policemen to leave so they could "tweek," 
scrounge the ground for rocks of cocaine dropped during the raid and overlooked 
by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people here are down and out. They're addicted and they need a 
place to go," Amescua said. Without major increases in treatment programs, he 
predicted, "most of them will live their lives just the way they're living it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But one onlooker, a 27-year-old transient originally from New York, said there 
was nothing the government could do to change his addiction to "hitting the 
pipe." 
</P>
<P>
"Treatment centers just let your mind sleep," he said. Then you wake up one day 
"and you have to have it." 
</P>
<P>
As the officers pulled away, he joined two dozen others in a frenzied search 
along the ground.

All 23 crew members aboard a leaking Liberian-flag freighter were plucked to 
safety Thursday after their vessel began sinking during rough weather, an 
official at Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said. An air force helicopter flew 
the 12 Filipino, four Chinese and five Hong Kong men and one Burmese to the 
western Japanese city of Kyoto from the 7,027-ton Maritime Gardenia.

CATALINA GOATS BEING SHOT TO PROTECT ISLAND'S ECOSYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thousands of goats, descended from a handful brought to Santa Catalina Island 
by Spanish missionaries in the 1800s, are being eradicated by sharpshooting 
hunters hired to kill the beasts to protect the ecology on the west end of the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
A team of biologists, armed with high-powered rifles and radios and tracking 
their prey from helicopters, is charged with eliminating as many as 3,000 of 
the wild goats. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, which owns 86% of the land 
on the island, say the mass shootings are the only practical way to stop the 
animals from stripping the land of vegetation and threatening native species 
like the Catalina mahogany tree and the island fox. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 goats have been killed since Jan. 15, and at least 1,000 more are 
being tracked by four high-tech hunters in the rugged island canyons farthest 
from the town of Avalon, said biologist David Garcelon, who is leading the 
hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"The goats are not part of the ecosystem on Catalina," said Penelope O'Malley, 
a spokeswoman for the conservancy, which works to preserve many of the island's 
native plants and animals. "Unfortunately, we have to undo what was done in 
error before." 
</P>
<P>
But animal rights activists, who learned of the shootings Thursday, said they 
are outraged by what they called the "slaughter" and might seek a court order 
to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"A mass execution, a mass hunt, falls into the category of cruel treatment," 
said Dana Cole, a spokesman for the Fund for Animals. "There are a wide variety 
of ways to trap animals. . . . We are always willing to come up with an 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Fund for Animals volunteers stopped a plan by the Navy to 
shoot goats on San Clemente Island that was also meant to protect the natural 
island habitat. The organization was eventually given permission by the 
Pentagon to trap about 3,300 of the animals and take them to ranches in 
California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina conservancy officials said they considered trapping their goats, but 
discarded the idea as too difficult because of the rough terrain on the west 
end of the island. Besides, they concluded, many of the animals would just end 
up dying of shock in captivity -- a theory that Cole said has been disproved. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage between Santa Catalina Island, 22 miles off the coast, and 
domesticated goats may have been star-crossed from the start. Spanish 
missionaries are believed to have brought the goats to the island as food for 
the native Gabrielino Indians in 1827, even though the tribe had survived well 
on native plants, animals and fish, O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gabrielinos eventually relocated to the mainland, but the goats stayed and 
prospered, eventually growing to as many as 25,000 in the 1950s, said Doug 
Propst, president of the conservancy and a 37-year island resident. 
</P>
<P>
The goats eat just about anything in their path, from grass and flowers to 
cactus and tree bark, Propst said. Over the years they have denuded vast 
stretches of the island. 
</P>
<P>
With ground cover gone, top soil can be blown away and larger plants and trees 
have no fertile ground in which to drop their seeds. Without the foliage "the 
land is dead," and animals like the island fox, which is listed on the 
California endangered species list, have no place to build their dens, O'Malley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Routine game hunting has limited the size of goat herds on the eastern half of 
the island, where the goat population has not been determined. The 
conservancy's hunters will not venture east of the Isthmus, a narrow point 
between the island's east and west sections, Propst said. 
</P>
<P>
On the west end, conservancy officials decided they needed a more aggressive 
approach. Goats had become largely invulnerable there because most game hunters 
were unwilling or unable to make their way into the steep canyons, Propst said. 
</P>
<P>
To eliminate the goats, the conservancy hired the Institute for Wildlife 
Studies, the same conservation group that helped reintroduce the endangered 
bald eagle to Catalina in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see a situation like this," said Garcelon, the hunt leader. "The 
goats are just being goats. They didn't plan to come out and denude the 
vegetation and cause ecological havoc on the island. 
</P>
<P>
"I never feel good about having to shoot the animals, but I feel good when I 
see the way the islands recover afterward." 
</P>
<P>
The hunters, all biologists, are camping on the island for the duration of the 
hunt, which could last through February. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hunting is done on foot, although the men take a helicopter to 
particularly remote locations, Garcelon said. The hunters communicate with 
radios and try to force the goats into canyons and ravines where herds can be 
shot quickly. 
</P>
<P>
All the men are expert marksmen and try to make sure that they kill the goats 
cleanly, so that none have to suffer, Garcelon said. "We try to do it as 
humanely as possible." 
</P>
<P>
To find stragglers, the biologists may fit some goats with transmitting devices 
that would, in effect, use them as unwitting spies to disclose the location of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The dead goats are left to decompose where they fall and the nutrients will 
eventually help regenerate the soil that they have helped to damage, O'Malley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A trapping program that would have relocated the goats from Catalina in the 
1970s failed, because about half of the goats died of stress-related illnesses, 
Propst said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is instant," Propst said. "I think stress would be by far 
the worse way for the animals to go." 
</P>
<P>
Cole, of the Fund for Animals, disagreed. He said that only about 5% of the 
goats trapped on San Clemente Island died. The animals were captured in nets 
thrown from helicopters and then kept in pens together, to calm them. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials also briefly considered gathering the goats for food, but 
rejected the idea. The animals provide little meat and the cost would be 
prohibitive to pack out the carcasses and to dress and ship the meat, Propst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"An island is a much more fragile environment, because it is a closed system," 
O'Malley said. "We are trying to correct some of the mistakes made in the last 
century, when people thought nature was inexhaustible."

VACANT LOT RENTAL USE PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: BRADLEY PLAN WOULD HELP NONPROFIT BUILDERS ERECT AFFORDABLE UNITS. IT 
WOULD FOCUS ON DEMOLITION PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday proposed a new city program to help nonprofit 
developers build affordable rental housing on some of the vast supply of 20,000 
private vacant lots in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Still in the planning stages, the proposal came in response to criticism this 
week that the city ordered the demolition of 215 abandoned homes and other 
dwellings in 1989 after police or neighbors complained about crime, 
unsightliness and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the program will be aimed at the more than 200 lots made 
vacant by city demolitions as well as thousands of others left undeveloped by 
their owners. It is expected to offer as-yet undetermined financial or 
technical help to nonprofit developers to buy and build on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's announcement is his latest in a series of proposals to increase the 
city's supply of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also proposed improvements in Operation Knockdown, the special 
demolition program begun by the city last January to destroy dilapidated crack 
houses frequented by drug users and other vacant structures that become magnets 
for crime. 
</P>
<P>
The changes include review by Bradley's office and by the Community Development 
Department to assure that homeowners who want to rehabilitate their property 
have a chance to do so instead of seeing it destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Ed Avila said the Community Development Department will take extra 
steps to inform wayward owners of low-interest city loans, and the Department 
of Building and Safety will hand out flyers about city loans whenever neglected 
homes are threatened by possible demolition. 
</P>
<P>
A report in The Times on Tuesday said that an unknown number of rebuildable 
homes were torn down under city orders in 1989 because owners could not be 
located, could not find loans or were simply waiting for the land to appreciate 
and were not interested in making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the salvageable homes torn down by the city was being used by six 
homeless men who were put on the street two days after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said the majority of homes torn down last year were 
not rebuildable and attracted crime, "and if there were mistakes made, they can 
be rectified and won't be made in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fabiani assailed City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky for calling for a 
60-day moratorium on Operation Knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said that because the Westside councilman has very few crack houses or 
empty slum buildings in his generally well-to-do district, his involvement in 
the issue is "peculiar" and should be challenged by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani claimed that Yaroslavsky's district has lost far more affordable 
housing in the past decade -- 3,504 units -- than any other council district. 
He said most demolitions in Yaroslavsky's district were done by owners who 
replaced the dwellings with "expensive luxury housing." 
</P>
<P>
While not directly blaming Yaroslavsky for the dramatic gentrification of his 
district, Fabiani said, "He has done nothing to stand in the way of it." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, whose motion to delay Operation Knockdown will be considered next 
week, called it "outrageous that the mayor would seek to put a muzzle on a 
councilman who doesn't happen to represent the area (of the city) that's in 
question." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about private property owners in South-Central Los Angeles 
choosing to demolish their homes," Yaroslavsky said, referring to the high 
number of city-ordered tear-downs that occurred in poor areas. "We are talking 
about people who can't afford . . . to bring them up to code, losing their 
homes to a bulldozer." 
</P>
<P>
City officials on Thursday also clarified the original intent of Operation 
Knockdown, which was billed last January as an assault on crack dens. 
</P>
<P>
Avila said employees involved in the program in its first year publicly 
portrayed Operation Knockdown as encompassing all city-ordered demolitions of 
abandoned and troublesome housing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Avila said, the mayor had intended Operation Knockdown to include only 
the nuisance homes identified by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of other problem homes ordered demolished by the city in 1989 -- 
identified either by neighbors or City Council offices -- will not be 
considered part of Operation Knockdown, he said. Aside from that technical 
distinction, he said, such city-ordered demolitions will continue whenever 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
The city's broad demolition policies set it apart from Oakland, Boston and 
several other areas where housing shortages have spurred aggressive policies to 
restore derelict housing.

HELP ARRIVES FOR INJURED, HOMELESS MOTHER AND CHILD

<P>
Gwendolyn Leopolo arrived in Orange County this month with about $5 in her 
pocket, no job and a missing husband. Her grown daughter put her up for a 
couple of days, but the daughter's boyfriend made her leave. 
</P>
<P>
And then, just when things seemed like they couldn't get any worse, they did. 
As Leopolo and her youngest daughter walked from their homeless shelter in 
Tustin to a supermarket two weeks ago, a woman making a left turn struck them 
with her car, shattering Leopolo's left elbow and crushing 6-year-old Amanda's 
left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the little girl lies in a body cast, and she will be immobilized for 10 
weeks. Mother and daughter have no home to return to, and even little battles 
have been all too easily lost: While the two of them were recovering in the 
hospital, someone broke into their room at the shelter and stole the Barbie 
dolls that Amanda got for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Most tragically, however, the little girl's father is still missing at a time 
when his family needs him most. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss him," Amanda said Thursday. "He's in jail. I know it. I know about my 
daddy." 
</P>
<P>
Tears welled in Gwendolyn Leopolo's eyes as her daughter spoke. "I try not to 
cry around her," she said. "I'm trying to be strong for her. She and her daddy 
are very close. They're inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
Leopolo, 40, does not believe her husband is in jail, nor does she think he has 
deserted the family. They have been married for seven years, she said, and 
Manatu Leopolo, a native of the Pacific island kingdom of Tonga who has lived 
in the continental United States since 1981, has never wandered away from his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The family had come to Orange County from San Bernardino in January so that 
Manatu Leopolo could take a job with a local pool company. 
</P>
<P>
Manatu Leopolo, 33, called his wife on Jan. 1 to say that he had finished a 
pool job in Victorville and was hitchhiking home. He never showed up, and no 
one has heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Immigration probably got him," Leopolo said. "He doesn't have a green 
card, but he's legal because we're married and we have her (Amanda)." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Bara, a public information officer for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, said a computer check reveals no trace of Manatu Leopolo, indicating 
that he probably has not been picked up. Deportation, she added, would be 
unlikely unless Leopolo had agreed to pay his own way, since Tonga is so far 
away. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Manatu Leopolo would probably still be in detention if he had been 
apprehended. INS, however, has no record of him being held, Bara said. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Gwendolyn Leopolo with no clues and a handful of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, Amanda and her mother have lived at the Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where they were taken after the car accident. But they have 
recovered sufficiently to be released from the hospital, and Thursday it came 
time for the mother and daughter to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do it alone," Leopolo said as the two gathered their things in the 
hospital room. "There's no way I can even lift her. Not with one arm." 
</P>
<P>
Leopolo's family has been of little help -- one sister-in-law has chipped in, 
but her parents disowned her, she said, when she married Manatu. "They don't 
like the color of his skin," she said. "It's too black." 
</P>
<P>
To their rescue has come a hastily assembled coalition of private companies and 
social service agencies. Irvine Temporary Housing has arranged for them to stay 
at the Embassy Suites in Irvine for 10 days; the hotel is donating a room. The 
Irvine Assn. of Realtors has chipped in a VCR and a Nintendo game to keep 
Amanda occupied, and other local agencies have given shoes, food and other 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"They called us, and we jumped on it immediately," said Clyde Weinman, 
executive director of Irvine Temporary Assistance, a social service agency that 
provides emergency assistance to homeless people while still trying to "let 
them maintain their dignity." 
</P>
<P>
With the organization's aid, mother and daughter say they will be able to get 
by, at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Leopolo has also begun receiving federal assistance, and the money will help 
make ends meet while the two recover. Leopolo said she needs an operation to 
heal her elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been like total devastation," she added. "But I think we're going to 
make it with all these people helping us." 
</P>
<P>
Then she pauses: "I sure hope we can find my husband, though. We need him." 
</P>

DIANNE KLEIN: UNIVERSITY SWEEPS AWAY UCI'S DOMESTIC REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's quiet little experiment with domestic partnerships is over. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic partnership, if you have never heard the term, is a radical concept. 
It means that people in stable, amorous relationships, regardless of their sex, 
deserve the same legal rights as married couples. 
</P>
<P>
At UCI, for the last year and a half, it meant that committed gay couples, as 
well as unmarried heterosexual couples, could live together in married student 
housing as long as one of them was attending the university. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons of economics and convenience, this was a big deal. A two-bedroom 
apartment at the university's Verano Place, within easy walking distance of 
classrooms, rents for less than $600 a month. In Irvine, that's cheap. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons of fairness and consistency, it was an even bigger deal. It meant 
that the university, albeit quasi-officially, recognized that same-sex couples 
are entitled to more than a paper declaration of equality. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the city of Irvine, where the recent passage of Measure N removed gays 
and lesbians from protection granted by a human rights ordinance, University of 
California regulations bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
But there are exceptions, at UC Irvine and the other eight UC campuses. Where 
the law discriminates against gays, such as in the military and by denying them 
a marriage license, so too may UC. 
</P>
<P>
That's a message that UC Irvine has now made perfectly clear. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning immediately, the university will no longer allow unmarried couples to 
apply as a family to rent at Verano Place. Only non-traditional families that 
can prove a blood tie -- i.e. brothers, sisters, cousins, in-laws and the like 
-- will have that right. 
</P>
<P>
Has this decision been made because unmarried couples have abused the 
university's largess? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Since the pilot program began in September, 1988, just 11 non-traditional 
families have applied and all of them -- three lesbian couples, four cases of 
siblings, three adult children with their parents and one extended family -- 
have been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
And everyone involved with the program -- from Vice Chancellor for Student 
Affairs Horace Mitchell to housing administrators to non-traditional and 
traditional renters -- has told me that there were no glitches. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the change, quite simply, is politics. The University of 
California is afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been discussions at the level of the Council of Chancellors about 
the appropriateness of housing gay and lesbian couples in married student 
housing," Mitchell told me. "And that group has consistently reaffirmed that it 
is not the policy of the university to allow gays and lesbians in married 
student housing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are general concerns, about spousal benefits, life insurance, a whole 
range of benefits that the university provides. The university said that it is 
not in a position to make that kind of decision without the courts acting 
first." 
</P>
<P>
What that means, essentially, is that small concessions to gays and lesbians 
may lead to larger ones, involving money that UC is not willing to spend. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be inferred," Mitchell said when I ran that theory by him. "We went 
first and nobody followed, and the very clear message was that our going was 
not consistent with university policy." 
</P>
<P>
And what that means, UCI's gays say, is betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no safe place for lesbians and gays," said Chris Browning, a 
psychologist at UCI's counseling center who is a chairman of Chancellor Jack W. 
Peltason's Advisory Committee on Gays and Lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to be an enlightened atmosphere. Here was just a tiny, tiny 
scrap, and they took that away too." 
</P>
<P>
Graduate student Randy Kerr, a member of the Chancellor's Think Tank on 
Diversity -- which has recommended that the university afford domestic partners 
the same benefits as married couples -- said: "I feel very angry. . . . We 
smile and we shake hands, and then we turn our backs and the chancellor kicks 
us in the ass. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm overstating the real psychological and emotional damage done 
by this decision. What the university is saying is that our relationships are 
not real. Lesbian and gay couples only stay together because we love each 
other. It's not because of children or family pressure. This really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
And after the passage of Irvine's Measure N, added one lesbian couple granted a 
Verano Place apartment as part of the pilot program, the implications of the 
university's decision seem particularly damning. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of feel betrayed by the city," one of the women said. "I never thought 
this was a liberal place, but I didn't expect this. I don't feel very safe here 
in general. This is one more thing, part of a depressing trend." 
</P>
<P>
UCI says it will not evict the three lesbian couples already installed in 
married student housing and stresses that there is nothing to prevent two 
full-time students from living as roommates on campus, regardless of their 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
But, clearly, the university administration and its gay students, faculty and 
staff members are not even talking the same language. The chancellor, for 
instance, seems to deny that the pilot program ever existed and insists that 
there is no discrimination against gays at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration's policy has always been that housing at the university 
campus is for students and their dependents, as defined by the laws of the 
state," Peltason told me. "It was never meant for same-sex couples. When I was 
asked to accept a domestic partnership as the equivalent of a marriage 
certificate, I said we cannot do that." 
</P>
<P>
The University of California says that it is not in the business of defining 
family. But by denying that title to gays, I think they already are.

Pilots at Fullerton Municipal Airport plan to test several takeoff procedures 
Saturday to discover quieter ways to gain altitude over nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do noise tests on various aircraft to find out if in fact they can 
be flown quieter and still be flown safely," said Bob McNutt, president of the 
Fullerton Airport Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association will use a sophisticated sound-monitoring device to analyze the 
airplane noise to compare different takeoff procedures, McNutt said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots association, in conjunction with the airport staff, will conduct the 
tests from noon to 2 p.m. using several models of the Beechcraft Bonanza, the 
noisiest airplane in use at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
McNutt said he hopes the tests will not only show pilots quieter ways to get 
off the ground but also show Buena Park residents and officials that the pilots 
are trying to be better neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last six months, we've come under fire quite heavily from Buena Park," 
he said, referring to a recent crash at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Elder, director of the airport, will participate in the tests by flying 
his own Bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
"Many pilots, and I include myself in that, are probably not as noise- 
sensitive as we can be," Elder said. "We hope to work with pilots to show them 
that there are some ways to minimize noise of the aircraft and still maximize 
(takeoff) performance." TOM McQUEENEY

A controlled fire Thursday in Emerald Canyon jumped fire lines and blackened an 
area that was scheduled to be burned today. 
</P>
<P>
"Dryness of the soil and the severe fire hazard, as well as a little wind, 
caused the fire to jump over lines we had set for (Thursday's) burn," Orange 
County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
The wind-whipped fire burned about 50 acres more than was scheduled for 
Thursday's operation. "But the area . . . is still well within the total 
500-acre controlled burn site," Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials summoned 10 more fire engines to the scene -- a contingency plan 
that is implemented when flames jump fire lines, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from the fire was visible over a wide area of the South County, Raymond 
said, prompting many calls to the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond said the major part of the controlled burned will take place today if 
the weather and the winds permit.

COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO LIFT PARKING BAN 
</P>

<P>
The City Council has unanimously rejected a proposal to allow parking along a 
210-foot stretch of Bever Place, citing fears that such a change might invite 
prostitutes back to the area near Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Edward Allen, who wanted the red curb and "no parking" signs 
removed, said the additional space was needed for tenants of an apartment 
complex on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see any prostitutes," he said. "I felt like people could use that 
space." 
</P>
<P>
The red curbs were part of a 10-point plan to rid the city of prostitutes in 
1987. The aggressive measures included prohibiting parking along most of Beach 
Boulevard and about 200 feet of cross streets. Bever Place is just off Beach 
Boulevard and north of Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's suggestion was opposed by law enforcement officials who said the 
prostitutes are far from gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it worth risking this just to get the prostitutes back?" asked Capt. Robert 
Eason of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 'It's just worked out too good 
to get rid of the red curbs." 
</P>
<P>
Eason said his department arrests an average of 30 prostitutes every month in 
Stanton, compared to 100 to 500 prostitutes jailed monthly in 1987. CHRISTOPHER

LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MESS COOKS

<P>
The weapons were high-speed mixers, Cuisinarts and spatulas. The mission was to 
whip up the most exotic haute cuisine this side of Wolfgang Puck. The 
location:Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
A Marine mess hall?The address on the press release wasn't a mistake. On 
Thursday, 42 cooks from Marine bases at Tustin, El Toro and Camp Pendleton were 
applying the crowning touches to culinary creations that would tickle the 
palate of any five-star restaurant regular. 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth annual Culinary Arts Exhibition, a competition among Marine 
cooks to prove to themselves and anyone willing to take a bite that the corps 
has enlisted more than a few good cooks. 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that military cooking has taken more than its share of criticism 
over the years. And those in the mess hall who plan, prepare and plop those 
hearty -- some say mysterious -- entrees onto hundreds of trays each day are 
more than a little miffed by the lack of respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Day in and day out, mess cooks don't get the respect they should," complained 
Sgt. Paul Washington, the head baker at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. "Most 
of the guys who eat in the mess think the only thing we can do is cook chicken 
three different ways or fry a jelly doughnut. C'mon, we're artists. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
To prove it, Washington was ankle deep in spent tubes of decorative icing which 
he had used on his creation, a "Day in the Park" -- a lavish, white pound cake 
more 3 feet long and 2 feet wide covered with shaved coconut dyed green to look 
like grass. He built a teeter-totter, park bench and drinking fountain using 
edible gum paste. 
</P>
<P>
The master touch was the pond in Washington's park:a clear Pyrex bowl sunk in 
the cake and filled with water and two goldfish. Even the cake below the bowl 
was dyed blue. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me we can't cook," Washington remarked, smiling at the cake, which was 
large enough to serve about 300. 
</P>
<P>
At the cavernous kitchen at the Tustin base, competing cooks -- some huddled in 
teams and others working alone -- looked as serious as Superbowl combatants. 
Some formed elaborate ice sculptures, including the Statue of Liberty and 
Batman, while others fashioned whales out of watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was started eight years ago by the Tustin Chamber of Commerce, 
anxious to show its appreciation to the Marines for helping cook pancakes 
during the city's annual Tiller Days celebration. The chamber still pays for 
the trophies, as well as most of the food used in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Winning isn't everything, the cooks say. But it has to be mighty important, 
judging by Staff Sgt. Phillip Johnson's entree in the seafood category. Johnson 
and his partner, Cpl. Clarence Green, created an entire tropical island scene. 
The ocean was various shades of blue gelatin dotted with snails, oysters and 
smelt. Cucumbers garnished with green peppers served as palm trees and coconuts 
cut in two were beach huts. Mounds of mashed potatoes formed the mountainous 
backdrop, and Johnson even fashioned cooking pots out of radishes filled with 
dry ice that appeared to be smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Top-flight food, as military fare goes, is nothing new to the Tustin air 
station. In May, the 42-member mess hall staff was honored as the best in the 
Marine Corps nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But as any restaurateur will attest, for every satisfied customer, there's one 
who walks out grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Those cooks can win all kinds of awards, but unless they find a way to keep 
those French fries warm, they won't win many fans on base," one Marine said 
Thursday as he left the mess hall. STEVEN R. CHURMMARINE CUISINEGROCERY LIST

FIRMS MEET DEADLINE ON FAST-TRAIN PLANS 
</P>

<P>
One Canadian and two U.S. firms met Wednesday's deadline and filed letters of 
intent to bid on the proposed high-speed train between Las Vegas and Anaheim, 
project officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel International of San Francisco, Morrison-Knudsen Co. of Boise, Idaho, 
and Bombardier Corp. of Canada met the 5 p.m. deadline and consequently will 
compete for the right to privately finance, build and operate the 300-m.p.h. 
train, which is expected cost as much as $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel, in partnership with West Germany's Transrapid firm, is advocating use 
of a magnetically levitated train that is going through final speed trials at a 
test track near Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
Bombardier is proposing use of the French Tres Grande Vitesse, a steel-wheeled 
train in service mostly between Paris and Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison-Knudsen has not indicated which technology it intends to propose, 
according to Paul Taylor, executive director of the California-Nevada 
Super-Speed Train Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The firms have until July 15 to submit a plan proposing the route, the stations 
to be served and 100%private financing, Taylor said. Construction is expected 
to take from 1993 through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
However, several hurdles remain, such as acquiring rights of way and completing 
environmental impact studies. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth, a member of the bistate commission, is 
scheduled to lead a delegation to Europe in March to ride the West German and 
French trains. He has asked several political supporters to join him at their 
own expense. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel last week contributed $750 to Roth's reelection campaign. Roth has been 
touting Bechtel's proposal to use "mag-lev" technology for more than a year but 
has said he is also open to other possibilities. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
$500,000 IN COCAINE, 10 SUSPECTS SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach police Thursday announced the arrests of 10 people and seizure 
of cocaine valued at more than $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the arrests, made in two separate raids in the past week, 
was delayed pending a continuing investigation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers working with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration arrested 
four Colombian nationals and seized five kilograms of cocaine valued at 
$500,000 after searching a house in West Covina, the result of a three-month 
undercover investigation, said Lt. Patrick Gildea. 
</P>
<P>
Gildea said charges against the four Colombians, arrested a week ago, are 
pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, narcotics officers arrested six people after receiving an anonymous 
tip that a drug ring was being operated from a Huntington Beach motel, Gildea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said police obtained a warrant after witnessing what appeared to be drug 
transactions from the motel room. After serving a search warrant, police seized 
a pound of cocaine valued at $50,000, paraphernalia used in the manufacture and 
smoking of "rock" cocaine, and $2,000 in cash, Gildea said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and booked on suspicion of conspiracy to sell cocaine were Timothy 
Soto, 26, Byron Navarez, 33, John Acosta, 31, Michael Hoffman, 26, Leona 
Alaniz, 19, and Brandi Knapp, 23.

FIRE SEASON CLOSED, SO AREAS REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Fire Department this month officially closed fire season and 
reopened four previously hazardous fire areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had sufficient rainfall and conditions look good," said department 
spokeswoman Kathleen Cha. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean we wouldn't close them again if things change. Hot, dry 
Santa Ana winds could cause closure at any time." 
</P>
<P>
The areas, which total about 97,000 acres, include unincorporated land and 
eastern Yorba Linda property between the Los Angeles County line and the 
Riverside Freeway, the unincorporated and wild-land areas between the Riverside 
Freeway and the San Diego County line, the unincorporated Irvine Coast area 
between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach and the unincorporated South Coast area 
bounded by Laguna Hills on the north and Laguna Niguel on the south. 
</P>
<P>
The four areas are closed each year when fire season begins, usually in May, 
Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing all depends on a combination of factors such as weather and fuel 
moisture, meaning moisture at the root level, not just what you see with the 
naked eye," Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire season goes as long as there is hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Other areas, such as pockets in Cleveland National Forest, are restricted 
year-round and are marked as such, he said. LESLIE HERZOG

HILL TOPS FUND HEAP IN SENATE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: CANDIDATES' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW ASSEMBLYMAN HAS RAISED $297,651 
FOR ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the last financial disclosure statement to be filed before next month's 
special state Senate election in the 31st District, Assemblyman Frank Hill on 
Thursday held an overwhelming fund-raising advantage compared to the other 
major candidates in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's statement said he has raised $297,651 since the campaign started Dec. 
24. Hill's war chest is almost seven times greater than the next largest 
campaign fund in the race. The Whittier Republican has said he expects to spend 
at least $500,000 during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
One surprise revealed in the finance reports was the poor showing of candidate 
and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who has raised only $43,778. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's was still the second-highest fund-raising total in the race. But 
when he launched his effort last month, Ferguson said he expected to spend 
about $350,000. Earlier this week he said he still hopes to raise $200,000 
before the Feb. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Isles, a Brea city councilman and another Republican candidate, has raised 
$14,039 during the race. But Isles, who is independently wealthy, has loaned 
his campaign an additional $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also loaned his campaign an additional $17,000 for a total of $60,778. 
</P>
<P>
Hill did not report any loans. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Graham, the leading Democratic candidate, had a total of $4,118, which 
included $2,258 in loans. 
</P>
<P>
The special election is to fill the seat left by the resignation last month of 
former state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). If no candidate 
receives more than 50% of the vote -- as is expected -- a runoff between the 
top vote-getters in each party is scheduled for April 10. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelmingly Republican Senate district is split almost in half by the 
boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties. It stretches from West Covina 
and Whittier in the north to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates have entered the race -- four Republicans, three Democrats and 
one American Independent. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Orange County registrar of voters office said the financial 
disclosure statements were required to be filed by 5 p.m. Thursday. But at the 
deadline, only Graham and the American Independent candidate had formally 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for some candidates were supplied by their campaign offices. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's report also showed that he has far outspent his competition with a total 
of $333,831 in expenditures between Dec. 24 and Saturday. He had $83,266 in 
cash left over and outstanding debts of $119,446. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has spent $47,606 in the race with $13,197 left in cash and debts of 
$17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Isles has spent $171,438. He has $36,670 in cash and outstanding debts of 
$186,569.

ABORTION: THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S WEBSTER DECISION COULD LEAD TO 'COMPULSORY 
PREGNANCY, FORCED CESAREAN SECTIONS, SURVEILLANCE AND DETENTION OF PREGNANT 
WOMEN,' A PLANNED PARENTHOOD FIGURE WARNS.

<P>
Attempts to restrict abortion might create a police state for human 
reproduction that would include compulsory pregnancy and surveillance and 
detention of pregnant women, the second-in-command of the national Planned 
Parenthood Federation warned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the chilling, logical outcomes of laws that protect fetuses at the 
expense of women's lives," said David J. Andrews, Planned Parenthood's 
executive vice president. "And we know that the victims of such laws will be 
the most vulnerable among us -- the poor, the young and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews issued the grim warning at a dinner marking the 25th anniversary of 
Planned Parenthood's county chapter, founded by Marian Garner. About 250 
Planned Parenthood supporters attended the event at the Irvine Hilton and 
Towers in Irvine. Garner was honored at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The county chapter opened in 1965 and offered a birth control clinic one night 
a week. Today, the local organization, which added a San Bernardino County 
affiliate in 1988, has a $3-million budget and five clinics open five days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the county chapter plans to open a sixth clinic and offer abortions, 
sterilizations and prenatal services. 
</P>
<P>
As 20 anti-abortion demonstrators picketed the hotel, Andrews attacked July's 
historic U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld a Missouri law barring 
abortions in public hospitals and prohibiting public employees from aiding 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In that closely watched Webster case, justices also said Missouri may require 
doctors to test women at least 20 weeks' pregnant to see whether their fetuses 
are viable -- and to prevent abortions if they are. 
</P>
<P>
The court, however, stopped far short of overturning 1973's landmark Roe vs. 
Wade ruling that legalized abortion, disappointing anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Last July, Americans' public health and private rights were taken hostage," 
Andrews said in his speech. "The Supreme Court's Webster decision invited 
states to lay siege to our right to make personal reproductive decisions." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Webster decision could lead to "compulsory pregnancy, forced 
Cesarean sections, surveillance and detention of pregnant women." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said several other legal battles are nearing that could disenfranchise 
teen-agers from their constitutional rights as well. Two cases are pending in 
Ohio and Minnesota that will determine whether parents should be notified of a 
minor's intention to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"You and I know only too well that pregnant teens who don't involve their 
parents have very compelling reasons -- they might get kicked out, disowned or 
far worse," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Becky Bell, 17, of Indiana, who was afraid to seek the 
parental consent that her state required and later died during an illegal 
abortion. Her parents are part of a public crusade against Indiana's consent 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews later turned his criticism to the anti-abortion movement, which he 
likened to the Ku Klux Klan and Nicolae Ceausescu, whose oppressive regime in 
Romania instituted mandatory pregnancy tests for women factory workers and 
barred contraceptives as well as abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"When democracy returned to Romania, the new government's first acts were to 
legalize abortion and unlicense typewriters," Andrews said. "This was clear 
recognition of a truth our leaders refuse to see: Freedom of reproductive 
choice is as fundamental as the right of free speech and the right of 
assembly."

TV CREW HELPS HOMELESS WOMAN GIVE BIRTH IN MACARTHUR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a section of MacArthur Park, where lives are often lost to crack cocaine, a 
new life began early Thursday when a young, homeless woman gave birth to a baby 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics, normally summoned to the lakeside park west of downtown to treat 
addicts who have overdosed on drugs, were called to the scene about 3:45 a.m. 
and "found this young girl on the ground," Los Angeles Fire Department 
Inspector Ed Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were homeless people around her and one was holding the child, still 
attached by the umbilical cord to the mother." 
</P>
<P>
Eugenia Marin, 21, had apparently delivered the 5-pound, 4 1/2-ounce infant 
herself, assisted by the light of a free-lance television news crew that 
arrived on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"They just left the light on," said Gary Arnote, owner of Newsreel Video 
Service, whose crew had heard the call to paramedics on a police scanner. "If 
we helped, we're glad to have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials said Marin had been living in the park since 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby was cold and dirty," Reed said, adding that paramedics clamped the 
umbilical cord, cleaned the infant, and wrapped her in a blanket before taking 
her and her mother to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a horrible way and place to have a baby," said Brad Lenhoff, one of the 
paramedics who assisted Marin. "But it looks as though the baby will make it." 
</P>
<P>
Mother and daughter were in good condition at California Medical Center, a 
spokeswoman said.

NEWPORT BEACH ATTORNEY ROBERT R. HURWITZ, 68, DIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert R. Hurwitz, who co-founded a Newport Beach law firm four decades ago and 
served as an officer of the National Council of Christians and Jews, died 
Tuesday after a long struggle against Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was diagnosed with the degenerative nerve disorder, also known as 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a year ago, but he continued to practice law 
until last May, when he lost his ability to speak and was forced to retire, 
said his wife, Shirley Mae. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1921, and served as an Army officer in 
Europe during World War II. He took an interest in the law after the war when 
he served as a military governor in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Graduating second in his law school class at UC Berkeley in 1950, Hurwitz and 
his brother, Max Hurwitz, opened the first law firm in Newport Beach the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, originally known as Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz, is now called Hurwitz, 
Remer, Divincenzo &amp; Griffith and represents Orange County clients such as 
the Costa Mesa-based Daily Pilot newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working as an attorney, Hurwitz served from 1964 to 1975 as a 
California inheritance tax referee. He eventually made that his field of 
expertise, serving as president of the Inheritance Tax Appraisers Assn., and 
vice chairman of a State Bar tax committee. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz taught inheritance law at the Pepperdine School of Law in the late 
1970s and was a member of several bar associations and other legal 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz served on the national board of the Council of Christians and Jews and 
was the founder and longtime chairman of the Orange County branch of the NCCJ. 
He said in a magazine interview last year that he got involved with the NCCJ to 
do what he could to reduce racial tensions in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was also a member of California Community Foundation, Orange County 
World Affairs Council, Town Hall of California and Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
After a foot operation in 1988, Hurwitz lost his ability to walk -- a condition 
doctors later attributed to ALS. He continued to work, however, until the 
disease robbed him of his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"With Lou Gehrig's disease, you never lose your mind. He lost his ability to 
communicate," said Hurwitz's son, Mark Hughes. "That was difficult for him." 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz is also survived by a daughter Kim Davidge, a sister, Sophie Gendel, 
and a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be private. Family members request that memorial 
donations be made to the ALS Foundation or to the NCCJ.

LOS ALAMITOS: CURRENT OWNER, A PROPONENT OF HARNESS RACING, NEGOTIATES WITH 
QUARTER-HORSE INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Alamitos Race Course, which was recently purchased by a harness racing 
group headed by Lloyd Arnold, might soon undergo another ownership change. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold is close to completing a deal to sell half interest in the 125 acres of 
race track property to Ed Allred and R.D. Hubbard, the quarter-horse interest 
that fought to prevent Arnold's purchase of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Allred and Hubbard would purchase half of the race track property for about 
$16.5 million. The Allred group would then run the two quarter-horse meetings 
at the track and Arnold would run the two harness racing meetings. The 93.5 
acres of golf course and the 75 acres of property Arnold hopes to have rezoned 
as commercial are not part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if the deal was completed, Arnold would not oppose the 
construction of a race track in the Riverside area that Allred and Hubbard hope 
to build. They will be seeking the approval, perhaps as soon as next month, of 
the California Horse Racing Board to build the facility. It would be located 
off Interstate 15, between the 60 and 91 freeways, near Norco. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of a facility near Riverside would create some overlap night racing 
in the Southern California area. Allred would like to race quarter horses at 
Los Alamitos for 23 or 24 weeks a year and at Riverside for another 14 to 16 
weeks. Harness racing would be at Los Alamitos for about 25 weeks a year. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a possibility that harness racing could be run at the Riverside 
facility. Allred's group is exploring a larger concept of a regional equine 
park that would include a rodeo ring and horse show arena. However, no such 
plans have been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold declined comment on the impending deal but did acknowledge the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of things on the table," Arnold said. "It's something that could 
happen or something that could not happen." 
</P>
<P>
Allred said the sale would not affect the improvement plans that Arnold 
revealed last week. 
</P>
<P>
"All that will be done by mutual consent," Allred said. "We see pretty much eye 
to eye and there are going to be improvements to the existing facility." 
</P>
<P>
Allred said that at the very least a clubhouse would be built costing between 
$5 million and $7 million. Allred also said he would like to build skyboxes at 
the facility, similar to ones at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Allred is the owner of several family planning and abortion clinics in Southern 
California. He is also president of the Horseman's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., 
which runs a meet at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard is the owner of Ruidoso Downs, a quarter horse track in New Mexico, and 
The Woodlands, a horse racing and dog racing facility in Kansas City, Kan. Both 
are horse owners. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a life and death struggle for two breeds," Allred said of quarter 
horses and standardbreds. 
</P>
<P>
"And this will work out great for both breeds. Each race meet will have its own 
management. I'll be president of the company that runs the quarter horses and 
Lloyd will run the harness group."

TV-RADIO: AS USUAL, MADDEN GOES AGAINST FLOW

Pat Summerall expects a high-scoring game with the 49ers winning. 
</P>
<P>
John Madden, although he says the 49ers may be the best team of all time, isn't 
making any predictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for the 49ers to win, 31-21, or something like that," Summerall said 
when CBS' Super Bowl announcers met with a few reporters to talk about Sunday's 
game. "It's going to be a high-scoring game. The 49er defense is underrated, 
but you've got to figure that John Elway is going to put some points on the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
Said Madden: "I don't know. Usually before a Super Bowl you always hear what a 
great game it's going to be, and then it turns out to be a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, this year, everyone is saying it's going to be a blowout, so maybe this 
time it will be a hell of a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think what Denver needs to do is let Elway do his thing. Forget trying 
to establish the run. Put Elway back there in the shotgun formation, bring in 
those four wide receivers and line 'em up sideline to sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'd do." 
</P>
<P>
How good are the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought before now the 1985 Chicago Bears (who won Super Bowl XX) were 
the best team ever. But I think this 49er team is even better." 
</P>
<P>
Madden said he's really not concerned if the game does turn into a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's 40-7 at halftime, they say that's when you go to your notes. But I 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you still have to pay attention to the game and just run with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be boring to some people, but not to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like in school when you say history is boring. You read about the 
Battle of Waterloo, and you say that's boring. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if you were there, if you were in the Battle of Waterloo, and you had 
muskets and stuff blowing by your head, you wouldn't say that was boring." 
</P>
<P>
You have to admit Madden does have a unique way of looking at things. 
</P>
<P>
More from Madden: He wonders where all the good defensive linemen have gone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real shortage. Before the draft, what every team says it needs is 
defensive linemen, but then it can't find any to draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe teams will start doing what the Rams do and start putting linebackers up 
there to play in the defensive line. There's no shortage of linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because there aren't many good defensive linemen, most teams are going with a 
three-man front. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, but I just don't see it working. You never hear about defensive 
linemen anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we had the Fearsome Foursome, the Steel Curtain, the Purple People 
Eaters. Now, I just don't think it would work if you tried calling a defensive 
line the Fearsome Threesome." 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: Of all the Super Bowl-related programs on television this 
weekend, the one not to miss is "Road to the Super Bowl" on Channel 2 Saturday 
at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This show is tremendous, as good as anything ever done by NFL Films, which is 
saying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Films put microphones on several coaches, including colorful Jerry 
Glanville. You'll love it. Guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Films has allowed stations to dub in their own hosts if so desired, so you 
will see Keith Olbermann as the host instead of Steve Sabol. 
</P>
<P>
For Madden fans, his Super Bowl Special, produced by GGP Sports, will be on 
Channel 2 Saturday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list includes Jennifer Montana, Ronnie Lott, John Taylor, Tom 
Rathman, Jim Burt and Matt Millen. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips is the 
lone Bronco representative. 
</P>
<P>
Other program notes: HBO's Super Bowl edition of "Inside the NFL," with Len 
Dawson and Nick Buoniconti, was shown Thursday night and will be repeated 
tonight at 7 and Saturday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the show, there is a fantasy game between the 49ers and the 
Broncos, done by NFL Films in the much the same way it did Dream Season for 
ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
There's a two-hour special, "Super Bowl Saturday Nite" on Channel 2 Saturday at 
9 p.m. It features a number of jazz musicians, plus other entertainers and 
comedians. Don Johnson is the host. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour Super Bowl pregame show will begin at noon, PST, Sunday; game 
coverage starts at 2 p.m., and the kickoff should be about 2:15. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 has Olbermann and Tony Hernandez in New Orleans and will have its own 
postgame show after the network signs off. 
</P>
<P>
Then at 9 p.m., there will be an Olbermann special, "Decade in Review." During 
the show, viewers will be invited to call (900) 786-2222 and vote for the L.A. 
athlete of the decade. Magic Johnson should be a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the calls will go to the the Bay Area Quake Fund. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Radio coverage of the Super Bowl will be provided by CBS Radio, with Jack Buck 
and Hank Stram, and carried by KNX (1070). . . . The TV Super Bowl commercials 
cost $700,000 per 30-second spot. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's NHL All-Star game coverage last Sunday got a national Nielsen rating of 
3.6. An NBC spokesman said the network was pleased. . . . CBS countered with a 
heavy-duty NBA doubleheader. The Lakers and Detroit got a 6.2 rating, the 
Chicago Bulls and the New York Knicks a 7.1. The L.A. ratings: A 2.7 for 
hockey, a 9.9 for Lakers-Pistons and a 6.9 for Knicks-Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday's UCLA-USC game will not be televised by ESPN after all. USC did 
not want to play at 8:30 p.m. So, instead the network's game will be California 
at Oregon State. . . . Did anyone notice not one Raider made the All-Madden 
team? Rams making it were Kevin Greene, Tom Newberry, Jackie Slater and Jerry 
Gray. Former Raider Matt Millen, now with the 49ers, also made the team.

NFL'S NEW CONTRACT MIGHT HAVE NEW LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: 18-WEEK SCHEDULE, PAY-PER-VIEW AND THURSDAY NIGHT GAMES COULD BE 
FACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL's three-year, $1.43-billion television contract expires Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have already begun on a new deal, and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
hopes to have a proposal to present to the club owners when they meet in 
Orlando, Fla., in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
None of the principals in the negotiations have been willing to speak on the 
record this week, but several details have been learned: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the owners get what they want, it will be a three-year contract worth 
nearly $2.5 billion. Each team now earns $17 million from television. Beginning 
next season, owners are hoping to be in the $28-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One way the NFL is planning to increase its value to the networks is to 
play 16 games over 18 weeks. That would mean each team would have two byes 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Teams would still play four exhibitions, but possibly over a shorter period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind 16 games over 18 weeks is that the networks would get two more 
weeks of football, yet owners would not be obligated to compensate the players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It has previously been believed that pay-per-view and/or local pay-cable 
would not be part of this contract, but it has now been learned that a number 
of owners want to have the flexibility to explore those areas. 
</P>
<P>
It might end up in a form as simple as, say, Ram exhibition games on 
SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, some owners, aware of the growing pay-per-view possibilities, would 
like to be able to put a limited number of non-sold-out, regular-season home 
games on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
This might not happen next season, but possibly within the term of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It has been reported that CBS is interested in taking "Monday Night 
Football" away from ABC, but the latest word is that CBS may be satisfied with 
merely retaining its strong Monday night lineup, which includes "Murphy Brown," 
"Designing Women" and "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president, has said that reacquiring 
"Monday Night Football" is his department's No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sunday night cable package is expected to be increased to include the 
full season instead of just the second half. However, insiders are saying there 
is no guarantee that ESPN will be able to keep the package. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner is said to be interested in Sunday nights and is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated that ESPN overextended itself with its $400-million bid 
to acquire baseball and might not have enough money in its coffers to pay for 
pro football again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fox Television, shut out three years ago, is interested in a Thursday night 
package, as is HBO. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's problem is that the NFL doesn't believe that HBO, which has 18 million 
subscribers, can offer enough exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another aspect of the contract negotiations is what to do with the AFC 
package. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC, which has teams in all of the top five markets -- New York, Los 
Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco -- is also perceived as the 
stronger conference. 
</P>
<P>
So, the NFC is considerably more attractive. CBS wants to keep it; NBC wants to 
wrest it away. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL, a source said, is trying to work out the logistics to sell the AFC and 
NFC as one package, as is done in baseball. NBC and CBS would simply share the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a Ram road game could appear on either CBS or NBC, depending on 
the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that appears certain is that the NFL won't be offering any bargain 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The league, which can boast that it is No. 1 in popularity, can simply point to 
the huge increases for baseball and basketball, then say to television: "Now 
it's our turn."

JOHN RAMSEY, VOICE OF L.A. SPORTS, DIES; 
</P>
<P>
ANNOUNCER: HE WAS THE PUBLIC-ADDRESS MAN FOR NEARLY EVERY MAJOR TEAM IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Ramsey, 62, a familiar voice to Southern California sports fans for more 
than a quarter of a century, died early Thursday morning of a heart attack at 
Long Beach Veterans Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey had been the public-address announcer for virtually every major sports 
team in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he had been suffering from complications of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
At one time or another, Ramsey's deep, clear voice was heard by fans of USC 
football and basketball, the Rams, Raiders, Lakers, Dodgers, Angels and Kings. 
He would often announce five games over a three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
He was also the P.A. announcer for five Super Bowls and for the basketball 
venue here at the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, though, Ramsey confined his announcing to Trojan football games at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
His announcing style was articulate, unruffled and deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
He got his biggest break in 1958 when Tex Rickard, the Dodgers' public-address 
announcer in Brooklyn, declined to move to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey appeared, or his voice was heard, in several motion pictures, most 
notably "Two Minute Warning." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey was born in Berlin, New Hampshire, and served in the Navy during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
He later attended El Camino College and USC, where he earned his B.A. in 
business in 1954 and a master's degree in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey is survived by his former wife, Vivian, a daughter, Josette, and a 
brother, Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are pending.

LOYOLA OUTLASTS PORTLAND, 126-103

<P>
The University of Portland has won only 13 games in the last three seasons, but 
for nearly 30 minutes Thursday, the Pilots appeared ready to upset 22nd-ranked 
Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Portland built first-half leads of double figures and had a seven-point 
advantage in the second half in front of 4,886 at the Chiles Center before 
Loyola ran away with a 126-103 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions got the victory behind the scoring of Bo Kimble, who had 39 points, 
Hank Gathers with 31 and Jeff Fryer with 24. 
</P>
<P>
Portland tried to run with Loyola in the second half, and was outscored, 69-42. 
The Lions scored 52 points in the last 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is 14-3 overall and 5-0 in the West Coast Conference. Portland fell to 
5-13 and 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys had to play up in the second half, and they did," Loyola Coach Paul 
Westhead said. "It was not an easy win. I sensed it was going to be a game we 
would have to win; it wouldn't be handed to us. The first 10, 12 minutes we 
gave them reason to think that." 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots set the pace in the first half. Led by Will McDowell's eight points 
and some long-range shooting by Josh Lowery later, Portland overcame an early 
deficit and led, 43-32, with 6:11 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola answered with a 14-4 spurt in the next two minutes to pull to within a 
point, then regained the lead at 50-49 on a free throw by Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
But Portland finished the half with a 12-7 run, held a 61-57 lead at halftime 
and moved ahead 64-57 early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But six minutes into the half, Loyola turned its press up a notch. The Lions 
outscored the Pilots, 18-5, to take the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Down the stretch, Kimble, who had been scoring mostly inside, pulled up for 
four three-pointers, and Fryer added three more as the Lions hit 12 of 21 shots 
from three-point range in their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell finished with 29 points and 14 rebounds, and Lowery added 24 points 
for the Pilots. Gathers and Kimble each had 11 rebounds. Per Stumer added 11 
points -- three three-pointers -- and eight rebounds. The Lions' press forced 
24 turnovers.

LEWIS' RETURN SPARKS PEPPERDINE

Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury had said earlier this week that Tom Lewis could 
give the team a lift if he came back from a suspension and played well at both 
ends of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis did just that in the first half Thursday night against Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
He made all three three-point shots he attempted en route to 13 first-half 
points, spurring Pepperdine to a 74-69 victory before 2,987 at the Martin 
Centre. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, who won their second consecutive game from Gonzaga, improved to 9-9 
overall and 3-2 in the West Coast Conference. The Bulldogs fell to 6-12, 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who lost his starting forward spot when he was suspended for three games 
after missing curfew following a road game at the University of San Diego, was 
jeered by the Gonzaga student section before the game. The students hooted, "We 
want Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
They got their wish about six minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the next six minutes, Lewis scored his three three-pointers and was four of 
five from the field, boosting the Waves to a 41-30 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga pulled within five points of the Waves several times in the second 
half, largely on Kendall Simmons' outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But Geoff Lear made three tough baskets off offensive rebounds late in the 
game, and Craig Davis made a three-point shot with 1:24 to play to give the 
Waves a 71-61 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Lewis, who scored 15 points and had six assists, had played 
very well on offense and "pretty well" on defense until he tired in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Lear, who scored 11 of Pepperdine's last 20 points, led his team with 16 points 
and eight rebounds. Asbury praised him for making "some big-time plays." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that winning two consecutive close games from Gonzaga should help 
the Waves the rest of the way in conference play. Last Saturday, the Waves 
trailed the Bulldogs by 15 points midway through the second half, but came back 
to win, 68-67, in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons scored a team-high 18 points for Gonzaga, and Brian Frederickson and 
Bret Holmdahl each added 15.

SCHINTZIUS QUITS TEAM AT FLORIDA

Dwayne Schintzius, Florida's leading scorer and rebounder until his suspension 
Jan. 15, said Thursday he is leaving the team because he doesn't want to "sail 
under the authority of Captain Ahab." 
</P>
<P>
The comment was an apparent reference to Coach Don DeVoe, who replaced Norm 
Sloan before the season. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius and teammate Tim Turner had been suspended for their role in a fight 
at an off-campus fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
DeVoe said he invited Schintzius, a senior, back on the team Wednesday as long 
as Schintzius obeyed team policies. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can argue that Coach Sloan and (departed assistant coach Monte) Towe 
were easy to play for, and to them you had to accept the coach as the absolute 
authority," Schintzius said in a written statement. "But that does not mean you 
must sail under the authority of Captain Ahab. . . ."

METCALF IS GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN AT TEXAS A &amp; M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Texas A &amp; M fired Shelby Metcalf this week, it signaled the end of the 
reign of one of the most enduring coaching figures in college basketball. 
Metcalf was in his 27th year at A &amp; M, which has fallen upon hard times 
recently. But indications are that isn't the only reason Metcalf lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf, 59, had been at odds with Athletic Director John David Crow since Crow 
replaced Jackie Sherrill in December, 1988. Metcalf narrowly escaped Sherrill's 
ax in 1987, when A &amp; M, the lowest-seeded team, won the Southwest 
Conference postseason tournament and reached the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
There were new rumors that Metcalf was in trouble early this season, but the 
end was sudden and unexpected, thanks to a newspaper article. Metcalf, in a 
Sunday Dallas Morning News story, was quoted as having said that Crow was 
making his life miserable. Crow fired Metcalf the next day and named Metcalf's 
assistant, John Thornton, as interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
In his tenure at A &amp; M, Metcalf went to the NCAA tournament five times, the 
National Invitation Tournament four times and won the Southwest Conference 
title six times. His 438-306 record made him the winningest coach in SWC 
history, but the conference may find it misses Metcalf's one-liners as much as 
anything: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After one of his players reported getting four F's and a D, Metcalf told 
him: "Son, you've been spending too much time on one subject." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "How come if a kid fails a course it's not a bad teacher, but if they can't 
play it's a bad coach?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Having breakfast at a coffee shop, Metcalf said a man walked up, shook his 
hand and said, "Coach, I'm behind you 30%," to which Metcalf replied: "Then 
you're one of the best friends I've got." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "When you stay at one place as long as I have, one year they want to name a 
street after you and the next year they want to chase you down it." 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf finally was caught, but his demise was a long time coming. The Aggies 
play their home games at 36-year-old G. Rollie White Arena, a drafty, barn-like 
building that seats 7,500, named after a former president of the Texas A &amp; 
M board of regents. 
</P>
<P>
Hated rival Texas posted consecutive sellouts against A &amp; M and Rhode 
Island in the 16,231-seat Erwin Center, so influential A &amp; M alumni 
grumbled about the average crowds in G. Rollie White being under 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, G. Rollie White was always a tough place for an opposing team to play, 
with the A &amp; M crowd offering the traditional Aggie "Gig 'em!" cheers and 
Reveille, the school's collie mascot, standing by for whatever action might be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Lemons, coach at Oklahoma City University and formerly the coach at Texas, 
said Reveille always causes problems for visiting teams at G. Rollie White. 
</P>
<P>
"That damned dog will bite you when you come down the ramp," Lemons said. 
</P>
<P>
In time, there were questions about Metcalf's change in philosophy to keep up 
with Texas by depending largely on junior college transfers. Some were not 
regarded as good citizens. Crow stepped in and kicked one of them, 6-foot-6 
forward David Williams, off the team for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies were 9-10 and 2-3 in the SWC when Metcalf was fired. Actually, Crowe 
"re-assigned" Metcalf to a position within the athletic department that has not 
yet been defined. Metcalf has met with William Mobley, the president of Texas A 
&amp; M, to clarify his situation. 
</P>
<P>
When Metcalf learned he was no longer a coach, he was typically disarming in a 
performance that was pure Shelby. As he faced television cameras that were 
carrying his remarks live, Metcalf made reference to Sherrill, to whom the A 
&amp; M board of regents paid the remainder of his contract after he was let go 
in the wake of an NCAA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish they'd pay me off like they did Sherrill so I can get the hell out 
of Dodge," Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf is under contract until Aug. 31, 1991, with a reported base salary of 
$75,000. But even if Metcalf doesn't have a team or a coaching job, at least 
he's still got his spread in East Texas near Palestine, which he calls the 
Jolly G. Rollie Ranch. Unless he renames it, Metcalf even has a lake to remind 
of his ties to A &amp; M: Lake Gig 'Em. 
</P>
<P>
The real truth: Lemons speculated on the real reason Metcalf lost his job at 
football-happy A &amp; M. "My guess is he missed a football game," Lemons said. 
"He didn't go see the Aggies face Rice and they caught him. There was a dummy 
sitting in his seat, you know, and a balloon with a hat on it saying Shelby." 
</P>
<P>
The short goodby: Lemons, 67, is retiring after this season. He said he did not 
call a press conference to announce his retirement plans because he was afraid 
no one would come. 
</P>
<P>
And what has been his team's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care, otherwise they'd be playing harder," Lemons said. "They 
probably figure they'll get somebody in who knows what he's doing, which is 
true. That's one of the reasons I quit. I've lost contact. When you look at the 
media guide and see a guy's favorite music is Heavy D, well . . . Who? That's a 
telltale sign I've lost it. Actually, I did know one person that was mentioned. 
I got one player going to be a doctor. He said Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the week: From Lemons on how some college basketball coaches 
eventually fall out of favor the longer they stay at a school: "They say when 
you move to town, that's the most friends you'll ever have." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Aid: The Syracuse Orangemen are no longer ranked No. 1 and no longer 
have the same starting lineup either. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Boeheim benched center LeRon Ellis, moved Derrick Coleman to the 
pivot and made 5-foot-11 freshman Michael Edwards a starter. Sophomore Tony 
Scott, a 6-8 reserve, is getting more playing time in a lineup designed to 
bolster the Orangemen's outside shooting. Boeheim said Ellis' weak rebounding 
made the move easier. 
</P>
<P>
The teams in the Big East play a zone or sagging man-to-man defenses against 
Syracuse, which forces Boeheim's players to shoot from the outside where they 
are weakest. How weak? They are under 30% from beyond the three-point line.

TUSTIN TAKES OVER AFTER A QUARTER TO BEAT UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this season, University High School took on Tustin in a 
matchup of the Sea View League's top teams. This time the game was on the 
Trojans' home court, but for the second time, University lost, this time 67-52. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Garner led the way with 21 points as Tustin (17-5 overall, 6-0 in 
league play) moved two games ahead of University (14-5, 4-2) in the league 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, who hit eight of 13 shots (62%), was more than just an offensive force. 
Her defense against University's leading scorer, Denise Gandara, helped Tustin 
pull away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Garner did a great job against Gandara," Tustin Coach Rick Falk said. "She 
(Gandara) had 10 in the first quarter. Garner held her to five points the rest 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The key was Falk's change from a zone defense to man-to-man in the second 
quarter. "They were killing the zone," Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
Especially Gandara, who made four of seven shots in the first quarter to help 
University take a 20-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But with Tustin's defensive switch, University and Gandara cooled off in the 
second quarter while Tustin got hot behind the penetration of point guard Wanda 
Sequeira and an improved performance at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Sequeira scored six of her eight second-quarter points at the line. She also 
twice assisted Garner, who had eight second-quarter points as Tustin outscored 
University, 18-9, to take a 33-29 lead at half. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers, who made only three of 11 free throws in the first quarter, made 
six of eight in the second and shot 46% to University's 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin made 11 of 12 free throws in the second half and pulled ahead, 50-38, on 
Shari Needham's three-point basket at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
University was never able to cut the lead below double digits and trailed by as 
many as 17 late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin had three players score in double figures: Garner (21), Needham (18) and 
Sequeira (17). University center Tara Wolff scored 12 points, mostly off 
perimeter jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen (University Coach) Doug (Sorey) play a zone," Falk said. "It 
was a complement to our kids. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big one for us. Probably the biggest game our kids have played. 
Before the game I told the kids to concentrate on the fact that we're the best 
team. There is no pressure on us." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin won the first time around, 58-53. 
</P>
<P>
In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 40, Newport Harbor 39 -- Host Corona del Mar won its first 
league game in two years when Mollie Flint scored a layup at the buzzer. Flint 
finished with eight points and Heather Flaherty had 23 points and 23 rebounds 
to lead Corona del Mar (3-15, 1-5). Stacy Giem had 19 points for Newport 
Harbor, which fell to 2-3 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 58, Saddleback 47 -- Melody Earle had 18 points and Liz Collins had 12 
points and 18 rebounds for visiting Estancia (8-10, 3-3). Janet Chacon had 22 
points for Saddleback, which dropped to 2-4 in league play.

The 36-hole Newport Pro-Am golf tournament begins today at the Newport Beach 
Country Club, with 74 professional golfers competing for a $50,000 purse, the 
largest in the tournament's 16-year history. 
</P>
<P>
This year's field includes five former Newport tournament winners -- Perry 
Parker of Costa Mesa, John McComish, Jon Chaffee, Tony Grimes and Mike Gove. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, four former PGA Tour winners -- Tommy Jacobs, Ernie Gonzales, 
Buddy Allin, Mark Pfiel -- and several players from the Golden State and Hogan 
mini-tours are expected to compete on the 6,546-yard Newport Beach Country Club 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, the defending champion, attempting to become the first player to win 
back-to-back titles. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a 25-year-old UC Irvine graduate, said his Newport victory last year 
opened a lot of doors for him. 
</P>
<P>
It also boosted his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"This tournament helped me realize that I can win and that I am capable of 
shooting low numbers with the pressure coming in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This tournament has helped me realize that I can win. It's the best field that 
I have ever been in and beat." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, an assistant golf coach at UC Irvine, continues to compete on the 
Golden State Tour; he missed qualifying for the new Hogan Tour by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he will try to qualify for the Canadian Tour this summer, and will 
return for his third qualifying attempt on the PGA Tour in October. 
</P>
<P>
McComish, the only person to win this tournament twice, will be back to try for 
his third victory. McComish won the PGA's long-driving category in 1983 and 
1987. He had his best year on the tour in 1989, winning $76,495. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport tournament, sponsored by the 552 Club, has raised nearly $1 million 
for Hoag Presbyterian Hospital in its 16-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The first tournament, held in 1975, was known as the Crosby Southern, a second 
PGA Tour event for players unable to qualify for the Crosby Clambake in Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There is no admission charge for the tournament, which is scheduled to conclude 
Saturday. MARCI HANOVER

The UC Irvine women's team lost its 12th game in a row Thursday, falling 67-46 
to Cal State Fullerton in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine also learned that Yvonne Catala, a freshman forward who had been the 
team's leading scorer, will be out the rest of the season. Catala injured her 
knee against Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, but Coach Dean Andrea hoped she would 
be able to return this season. But a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test showed a 
cartilage tear, and Andrea said Catala will not be back. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (1-15, 0-7) fell behind by 18 points at halftime Thursday and 
trailed by as many as 26. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be like the Navy," Andrea said. "Every day is an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Only two Irvine players -- Kathy Lizarraga and Kim Cox -- scored in double 
figures. Both scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (9-9, 4-5) has won three consecutive games after losing five in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Genia Miller scored 20 points and had 13 rebounds in the victory. Jill Matyuch 
added 13 points and Kathy Werth had 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to dig ourselves out," Fullerton Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah 
said. "But if we lose a game to any one other than the top three (Nevada Las 
Vegas, Cal State Long Beach and Hawaii), that changes the perspective. . . . 
We'd probably be very happy with a 15-win season. We'd have to win six of our 
last nine, but it's possible." ROBYN NORWOOD In California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. women's basketball: Chapman 84, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 72 -- Julie King 
scored a season-high 27, Bethel Trice had 22 and Jennifer Uecke added 20 for 
Chapman (14-6, 2-3) at home. Chapman trailed, 40-37, at halftime, but King had 
14 to lead the Chapman comeback. Vanessa Hornbuckle scored 15 for Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo (8-11, 2-3). In men's nonconference wrestling: Cal State Fullerton 
30, Missouri 14 -- Scott Schumm scored a pin over Greg Warren 1:50 into the 
match at 150 pounds to lead Fullerton at Central State in Edmond, Okla. Jeff 
Maes of Cal State Fullerton won a 12-6 decision at 126 pounds and Ramon Diaz 
won, 6-3, at 177 pounds. Nebraska 33, Cal State Fullerton 8 -- Only Lyndon 
Campbell and Dan Henderson won decisions for Cal State Fullerton against No. 4 
Nebraska. Campbell won a 7-3 decision over Dave Droegemueller in the 134-pound 
class and Henderson defeated Tucker Thompson, 8-5, in the 167-pound class. 
Fullerton also lost to Central State, 26-14.

PEOPLE: CHANGING OF GUARD AT HOMEFED CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. President Robert F. Adelizzi has been named chief executive of 
the savings and loan holding company, taking over day-to-day management from 
Kim Fletcher, who will remain board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi joined San Diego-based HomeFed, parent of HomeFed Bank, in 1962 and 
has been its president since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Fletcher said his primary reason for vacating the chief 
executive's job at the $18-billion thrift is to give Adelizzi the opportunity 
"to move up and assume more responsibility and be rewarded in title at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has done an outstanding job as president and chief operating officer," 
Fletcher said. "We have worked together as a team for over 20 years, and it's 
only right that he be given the recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 62, said HomeFed has no mandatory retirement age and age was not a 
factor in his decision to step down. He has been HomeFed chairman since 1979 
and chief executive since 1969. CHRIS KRAUL

<P>
Clearly many people in Orange County's real estate industry worked through the 
holidays because January has been a busy month for deal-making. Here are some 
of the bigger ones announced publicly: 
</P>
<P>
* CYP Inc., an Irvine architecture and planning firm recently ranked first in 
the county in volume of projects, unveiled plans for a $1.2-billion Puerto 
Rican resort said to be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. The 
resort includes five hotels, the first of which begins construction this year. 
The developers are IDG Resorts, Irvine, and TSA International, Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
* Swede-Cal Properties Inc., a group of California and Swedish investors, paid 
$15.3 million for Anaheim Corporate Center, four 4-year-old office and research 
buildings totaling 158,000 square feet on La Palma Avenue and Kellogg Drive. 
Commercial broker Daum Commercial Industrial Real Estate represented the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
* SBD Group Inc. bought a 28,500-square-foot shopping center in Cypress for 
$5.6 million, said commercial broker Grubb &amp; Ellis, which represented SBD. 
Selling the center, at the corner of Meridian Drive and Katella Avenue, was 
CC&amp;F Cypress-Katella Investments. 
</P>
<P>
* Systemhouse Inc., a Cerritos computer company, signed a 10-year lease valued 
at $10.6 million for 42,000 square feet of office space at a seven-story 
building which is the first to be completed at Cerritos Towne Center. The 
center will be the largest development in Cerritos -- 125 acres when it's 
finished -- and is at Bloomfield Avenue and the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
* In what it called one of the largest leases signed in central Orange County 
in 1989, Union Bank Square in Orange said Pacific Bell renewed a lease for 
170,000 square feet for two years at $8.5 million at an office complex in the 
Town and Country area of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
* And Michael Brandman Associates, a Santa Ana environmental consultant and 
planner, recently snagged a contract to write an environmental impact report 
for more than 3,000 acres called Eagle Valley that the city of Corona plans to 
annex. The company didn't say how much the contract was worth. 
</P>
<P>
Several local companies opened new offices elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
* Lee &amp; Associates Commercial Real Estate Services open a new Gardena 
office in the South Bay area Los Angeles. Head of the new office is real estate 
veteran Jack Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
* General contractor Elliott Corp., Newport Beach, opened an office in the west 
San Fernando Valley town of Calabasas. The 13-year-old company, with a annual 
sales of $60 million, says it has a lot of work in the area. 
</P>
<P>
And, there are a couple of new faces at local companies: 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Dennis, formerly vice president of development for the Newport division 
of big Newport Beach developer Koll Co., has moved to Brinderson Real Estate 
Group in Irvine as president. Brinderson builds offices around Southern 
California. A former real estate broker, Dennis is said to have put together 
several big joint ventures at Koll in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
* Meanwhile, Thomas Wilck Associates, an Irvine public relations firm, has gone 
international. Wilck recently hired Daria I. Novak, whose most recent job was 
as a State Department spokesman during the Tian An Men Square massacre in 
Peking. She also speaks Chinese. Wilck said the hiring was a "major commitment" 
to bag overseas clients, particularly Pacific Rim companies. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, hold your breath no longer for California Centers Magazine, a 
trade publication aimed at the state's shopping centers. The first issue comes 
out this month. Among the highlights, according to the Irvine-based magazine: 
"Deals of the Month," "Personal Spotlight" and "Industry Meeting Calendar."

CONDOMINIUMS SELL FASTER THAN HOUSES FOR 1ST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
An incontrovertible sign of the growing buyer acceptance of condominiums in 
Orange County is that new attached homes are now selling faster than new 
single-family homes -- the first time that has happened in the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by First American Title Co., buyers were closing 
an average of 2.1 sales a week at each of the 54 attached-housing developments 
that were selling new units in the county in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
That compares to average sales of 1.8 units a week at single-family 
developments in October and is the fastest sales pace ever recorded by the 
title company. 
</P>
<P>
The just-released survey found that the average attached home in Orange County 
has 1,461 square feet of living space -- up 17% from 1,247 square feet in May. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the developments offered units with 1,800 square feet or more, and 
two developments had floor plans in excess of 3,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
While the median price was $209,500 and the average was $252,034, the range ran 
all the way from $108,900 to $2.1 million, with the bulk of the units clustered 
in the $170,000 to $240,000 range. The median price is the halfway point, 
meaning half the units were priced lower and half higher. 
</P>
<P>
The average attached home now has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, an enclosed 
garage, a fireplace, and a patio or deck, the survey found. Just five years 
ago, the average condominium had two bedrooms and two baths, but the rooms were 
smaller. Carports rather than garages were the norm, fireplaces were rare and 
the average selling price was $131,094. 
</P>
<P>
Cathedral ceilings and innovative floor plans utilizing second-floor lofts and 
more open interiors are common design features in today's condos, while ceramic 
tile and top-of-the-line appliances have replaced the Formica countertops and 
budget fixtures of the 1970s condominiums.

OCEANSIDE CIVIC CENTER: 2 VIEWS;

<P>
DESIGN: THE CENTER HAS STRONG TIES TO SURROUNDING STREETS, WHICH SHOULD SPUR

<P>
This image-conscious, beachfront city is about to become an architectural 
mecca. A new civic center designed by Charles Moore is a pleasing and 
perplexing piece of work, the kind of place that should gain national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the center's human scale, wit and strong ties to the 
surrounding streets should provide the fabric that the city's threadbare core 
needs so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
Already, several new projects are scheduled to break ground nearby, including 
an apartment/retail complex, the kind of mixed use so effective in downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who designed the legendary '60s condominiums at the Sea Ranch in Sonoma 
County, the Piazza d'Italia in New Orleans and a soon-to-be-built theaters 
complex for Escondido, has given Oceanside a late-century homage to early 
20th-Century San Diego architect Irving Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Among the civic center's strong points are its rich detailing, sensitive 
siting, subtle echoes of Irving Gill and a nod to the importance of the 
automobile. Weaknesses include detailing, which at times obscures strong basic 
lines, and colors so whimsical that they sometimes distract from the solid 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's the bare backside of the City Council building, which Moore 
envisioned as cloaked in vine-covered trellises. These were vetoed by the 
current council after being approved by its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, Gill drew his own plans for a civic center on this same site in the 
middle of downtown at North Hill Street and 3rd Avenue, featuring his trademark 
arched arcades. Although most of the complex was never realized, his fire 
station and administrative building still stand on Nevada Street. These will 
eventually be renovated and put to city use. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's design incorporates several Gill-inspired arches. Most often, these are 
used at the edges of covered public walkways that provide key pedestrian 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
But, where Gill's architecture was spare modernism, Moore, hailed by many as a 
forefather of the postmodern movement, believes in rich ornamentation and a 
more light-hearted approach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the civic center has some of Gill's austerity, it has much more of 
Moore's own playful complexity, nowhere more apparent than in several of the 
public areas, where most of the money for ornamentation was spent on the 
colorful tiles. These flow like a rainbow sherbet river up walls and down a 
mock alluvial fan leading into the fractured geometries of a large fountain. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful perspective on these colors can be had from mid-block on Ditmar 
Street, looking west through the heart of the project. A soaring opening marks 
the center of the project, its ziggurat forms lined with maize, gray, mauve and 
red tiles. Below this pedestrian entry, workers were putting the finishing 
touches on a palm fountain to be bordered by eight tall lights in the form of 
palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Expanses of tile frame the entrance to the City Council chamber lobby, a 
wonderful space beneath a gigantic rectangular skylight, where a dramatic sky 
bridge crosses overhead to connect this building with the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
Progress on the council chamber was slowed when the city decided to add such 
high-tech features as large-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the various offices in the center, the first of which should be 
occupied late in February, shows up a few shortcomings. The partitioned work 
cubicles often clutter the spaces and block valuable light and views. Project 
design consultant Robbin Hayne said the architects wanted lower partition 
walls, and he wishes they had lobbied harder. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out from upper-level offices and hallways, the viewer is often 
confronted with unsightly rooftop mechanical equipment. Hayne said there wasn't 
sufficient budget to hide these appliances. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, though, the project succeeds magnificently with its two 
grandest gestures: a pedestrian space at the southwestern corner and the 
automobile entry along Ditmar Street, which runs through the project beneath an 
enclosed pedestrian bridge between two of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Urban Innovations Group of Los Angeles and production architects 
Danielson Design of San Juan Capistrano, Moore was selected from a talented 
field in a 1986 competition. 
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Contini, former president of UIG, had a hand in the design, lending his 
rational site planning to the group of designers who helped Moore work in his 
favorite team fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Hayne remembers the creation of the tiled "alluvial fan" that runs downhill 
through the center of the project, culminating in the large public fountain 
near the corner of Hill and Third streets. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the result of Charles having pencil in hand and drawing it during a 
design session. He is wholly responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's unconventional alluvial fan and fountain, with their jagged angles, are 
screened by a grid of palm trees anchoring the corner in the most orderly 
fashion. Here's the epitome of Moore's left and right brains working in happy 
tandem, as they do, with varying degrees of success, throughout the project. 
</P>
<P>
The library is the only portion of the project now in use. Its witty interior 
is marred only by mundane oak shelving and counters. The entry space has 
amazing energy. It rises to two stories, ringed by huge clerestory windows 
which make artificial lighting unnecessary during daylight hours. Study carrels 
line the second-floor railing behind arches set atop long, thin columns. 
</P>
<P>
Moving through this main space, one gets a sense of awe and respect appropriate 
for the repository of the city's knowledge and history. 
</P>
<P>
The northern side of the project is the least visible, but generates its own 
architectural excitement. A series of concrete buttresses fly toward the street 
from the parking garage, as if to prove that acres of rainbow tiles aren't 
essential to creating dramatic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering painting these bold forms. Pray that they don't. 
Architects and citizens should fight tooth and nail to preserve these finely 
crafted, unadorned details. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy pressure is also needed to make the city change its mind regarding the 
trellises Moore designed to soften the stark walls of the council chamber 
building. Of their $320,000 total cost, $160,000 had been spent when the new 
council did their flip-flop last summer. In an homage to Gill, these would have 
warmed the plain, white walls, including two five-sided turrets, with flowering 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday, someone will realize it would be nice to put them up," Hayne 
said.

17-YEAR-OLD WILL SOLO ON BOTH THE VIOLIN AND PIANO; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: PRODIGY COREY CEROVSEK WILL PERFORM TWO MOZART CONCERTOS TONIGHT AT ST. 
ANDREW'S CHURCH IN NEWPORT BEACH.

<P>
OK. Let's get the accolades out of the way right at the start. Early bloomer. 
Whiz kid. Dare we say, prodigy? 
</P>
<P>
In any case, 17-year-old Corey Cerovsek already has some dazzling achievements 
to his credit. He has played the violin with the Israel Philharmonic (conducted 
by Zubin Mehta), the Montreal Symphony (with Charles Dutoit conducting) and the 
Toronto, Vancouver and Hamilton orchestras, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
But wait! He also plays the piano, and has received awards and top prizes for 
his artistry on that instrument. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he will be soloist on both instruments tonight in two Mozart concertos 
-- one for violin, one for piano -- with the Mozart Camerata conducted by Ami 
Porat at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
He is completing his doctorate in music at Indiana University. Remember, he's 
17. He already has a master of arts degree in music, and the courses out of the 
way for an MS in mathematics, having already knocked off his bachelor's degrees 
in music and mathematics, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mathematics? 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the perpetual questions in my life: what I think the connection 
between music and math is," Cerovsek said in a recent phone interview from his 
home in Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, I very honestly would have gone into how deeply 
philosophically connected they are. But quite truthfully . . . now I say there 
is not much of a connection. I like the contrasts. It's a nice change to go 
from my music studies to mathematics. I'm lightening up these days." 
</P>
<P>
Born to Austrian parents in Vancouver, Cerovsek moved with his family to 
Bloomington when he was 12 so that he could begin studying at the university 
with famed violinist and teacher Josef Gingold. Cerovsek was the youngest 
student ever to attend the University. 
</P>
<P>
"That always has a great shock value," he said, "but it's a misconception to 
say that I started university at 12. I would have had to start high school at 
6!" 
</P>
<P>
Cerovsek was admitted as a special student because he did not have a high 
school diploma, and thus began what he called "the silliest episode in my life" 
-- completing high school through correspondence courses with a school back in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"I took driver's ed at 13 by mail," he said, "and if that wasn't silly, what 
is?" 
</P>
<P>
New to Bloomington and younger than his peers, Cerovsek followed his own 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a young, intelligent nerd type, I gravitated to a calculus book," he 
said. "I thought it was the trendiest thing. I didn't know anybody. There was 
nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I began taking math and calculus courses. Nobody noticed what you're doing any 
more after one semester. I didn't take any music. I took math courses. Three 
years later, I showed up at the undergraduate office and said, 'Oh, by the way, 
I got most of the requirements for this degree here.' They were shocked. . . . 
'You're still a high school student,' they said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I decided to step on the pedal on the correspondence courses. I did five or 
six lessons at a snatch instead of one at a time. Then I did the exams before 
getting the (corrected) stuff back. 
</P>
<P>
"So I got my Canadian diploma three weeks later by Federal Express, right 
before the semester was over. It was close timing. . . . I just love making 
trouble with their course numbers. It makes me feel so good to make trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cerovsek said he is beginning to take more solo stints as a pianist, 
most of his concerts have been as a violinist. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, without much hesitation, that I'm a violinist. My piano teacher (at 
Indiana U.), Enrica Cavallo-Gulliand, she's having woes trying to persuade me 
that, yes, I am a pianist. But I don't really practice a whole lot of piano. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
He is aware that many prodigies have burned out after becoming adults. "It 
doesn't worry me," he said. "It sounds contradictory but I've really been 
taking things at a relaxed pace, professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the States 5 1/2 years ago. There was a little flurry of media 
stuff. I was on the 'Tonight' show twice, there were magazines asking for 
interviews. It would have been possible, if I and my parents had wanted to, to 
make the most of this and make one of these very splashy entrances on the music 
scene. That's the kind of thing I would worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) the media managed to get bored very quickly and forgot about me. I went 
back to my studies. I am much more ready for a career at this point. I had a 
chance to study a large repertory and play a good deal of repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself actually in a transition at this point. The easy thing to do 
when you are, I guess, frankly, when you're naturally musical and such, is to 
do things very intuitively. That was the way I operated, until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"But nowadays, I find myself more and more, because of the degrees, 'maturing. 
. . .' You notice these things somewhat subconsciously -- here is the (musical) 
exposition, development, you change this theme in this way. It sort of 
buttresses your opinions. But I don't spend a lot of time thinking of it 
aloud." 
</P>
<P>
Cerovsek still lives at home and limits himself to two or three concerts a 
month. He admits that his youth gets him into some awkward situations. "People 
just don't know how they should talk to me. Often, when I'm introduced to 
somebody not my age, they have a terrible fear they can't talk to me, that they 
have to talk either (music) analysis or relativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Cerovsek will be both violin and piano soloist with the Mozart Camerata 
directed by Ami Porat tonight at 8:30 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 600 
St. Andrews Road, Newport Beach. Cerovsek will be soloist in the Piano Concerto

WEST GERMAN FILM MAKER FOCUSES ON RURAL AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTOR PERCY ADLON WILL APPEAR AT UC IRVINE TONIGHT TO INTRODUCE AND 
DISCUSS HIS FILM 'BAGDAD CAFE,' BOTH A CRITICAL AND AN ART HOUSE SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Director Percy Adlon, a West German, set his first English-language film, 
"Bagdad Cafe," in a ramshackle motel and roadhouse in a dusty corner of the 
Mojave Desert. His newest film is set in Stuttgart -- Stuttgart, Ark., not West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Adlon -- who will be at UC Irvine tonight to introduce a screening of "Bagdad 
Cafe" and to answer questions -- takes his camera to distinctly American places 
that somehow escape the attention of American directors. To Adlon, these small 
town places, and the people in them, are America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only 'out of the way' from a big city point of view. It's 95% of the 
country," Adlon said Wednesday, framed by the picture window of his office in a 
Westwood high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I learned as a documentary film maker: There are no ordinary 
people," Adlon said. "I really believe in 'ordinary' situations and people 
which I discover, finally, to be very extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
In "Bagdad Cafe," a hefty Bavarian housewife (played by the delightful Marianne 
Sagebrecht) is stranded in the desert after a fight with her husband, and walks 
to the tiny town of Bagdad where she slowly develops a friendship with a feisty 
cafe owner (played by CCH Pounder). 
</P>
<P>
Sagebrecht returns in the new film, "Rosalie Goes Shopping," as a mother of 
seven who manages to pad her husband's salary -- he's a crop-duster pilot, 
played by Brad Davis -- through increasingly brazen acts of credit fraud. The 
only person who knows what she is doing is the priest (played by Judge 
Reinhold), who hears her confession every day. 
</P>
<P>
"If you confess your sins, they're not sins anymore," Adlon said. "He gets more 
and more interested. He's actually waiting for her (every day), like people 
waiting for a sequel." 
</P>
<P>
The movie, he said, is a satire on a consumer society: "It's not aggressive 
against people, because I like people, but aggressive against the system," 
which he called "a prison of spending money." 
</P>
<P>
Adlon first used Sagebrecht, whom he discovered in a small stage production in 
Munich, in the film "Sugarbaby." While he refers to her affectionately as "my 
big Bavarian beauty queen," he said that this is the last film they will do 
together, at least for a while. "For the time being, it's completed now, our 
little trilogy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adlon, who continues to live primarily in Munich, has been in Los Angeles since 
September to arrange distribution of "Rosalie Goes Shopping," which opens in 
San Francisco Feb. 9 and in Los Angeles March 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Bagdad Cafe," a critical and art house success, is a warm and hopeful film. 
Adlon, who said he does not always want to play the "soft card," turned to the 
satire of the new film as a way of keeping a sense of variety. 
</P>
<P>
While he described "Bagdad Cafe" as a film about the "real paradise of 
friendship," the new movie, he said, is about the "false paradise of the 
shopping mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Percy Adlon will introduce "Bagdad Cafe" at 9 p.m. in the university's 
Physical Sciences Lecture Hall. After the screening, Adlon will answer 
questions from the audience. Admission: $2 to $4. Information: (714) 856-5588.

ROBBEN FORD PROVES HE'S UP TO CHALLENGE OF TRIO FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His reputation as a blues guitarist got him into the Miles Davis band. 
Wednesday at the Coach House, Robben Ford showed that despite his jazz 
associations -- he also was one of the original Yellowjackets -- he intends to 
build his solo career on his blues ability as well. 
</P>
<P>
His last album, 1988's "Talk to Your Daughter" (Warner Bros.), utilized 
keyboards and saxophones to add a glossy, more pop-oriented sound to his music, 
but Ford has trimmed his performing band down to a trio. The smaller group puts 
the focus squarely on the guitarist, and Wednesday night Ford was easily up to 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by bassist Roscoe Beck and drummer Tom Brechtlein (who recently has been 
heard with Lee Konitz and Charlie Haden as well as in Chick Corea's Akoustic 
Band), Ford seemed relaxed and confident during a set of mostly original music 
pulled from the album. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist was clean (apart from a few tuning problems), crisp and 
imaginative, constructing coherent solos with narrative qualities rather than 
depending on an endless string of hot, impressive licks. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Ford isn't capable of making heated statements. His solo on "Born 
Under a Bad Sign" began quietly but terminated in blistering runs and strong, 
assertive chording. The wide variety of sounds Ford pulls from his guitar 
rivals those of an experienced alley cat: howling, snarling and spitting before 
breaking into a warm purr. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's use of shifting dynamics -- something he probably learned from his 
former boss, Miles -- was particularly impressive. Loud, assertive themes gave 
way to solos that were played at a whisper's pitch. Volume would increase as 
improvisation progressed, sometimes returning to quiet understatement, other 
times swelling to a roof-raising climax. 
</P>
<P>
Ford sings with the pleasant tones of a choir boy, and his voice succeeds best 
during slower, relaxed numbers. He communicates well within a rather narrow 
range. But his sound could use some toughness, some sign of the disappointment 
and hard times associated with the blues. Not as emphatic with a lyric as 
someone like Robert Cray, he makes up for his vocal limitations with those 
convincing, hard-edged guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't limit himself to the blues. His own "Help the Poor," a soulful, 
steady rocker, featured the Spanish-tinged chords played over a bass line that 
recalled Michael Jackson's "Billy Jean." And Ford frequently made reference to 
tunes with jazz associations during the performance, moving in and out of 
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top" while soloing on "Nothin' but the Blues," and 
dropping hints of "Summertime" and Davis' "So What" during his closing 
instrumental number. 
</P>
<P>
Brechtlein and Beck provided solid support throughout, the drummer's 
on-the-beat toms and driving bass pedal pushing the entire performance. Beck 
stuck to the lower ranges of his instrument, adding only an occasional 
embellishment and not taking a solo of his own. Both were alert to Ford's 
shifts in volume, matching hushed tones with diminished responses, challenging 
loud passages with furies of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Even more basic was Juke Logan and Bill Lynch's opening set of classic blues 
and rock 'n' roll. Logan's harmonica work (that's him playing on the opening 
theme to "Roseanne") is reminiscent at times of Paul Butterfield's, and Lynch 
is a capable barroom guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
What the two lack in vocal skills was overcome by their enthusiasm, and their 
rough-and-ready style seemed to fit perfectly in the room's roadhouse decor. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's guitar soloing was especially passionate during "God Bless the Child" 
and Logan played melodica during one number, getting a funky squeeze box sound. 
Search these two out when you're looking for a good musical time.

ANN CONWAY: GETAWAYS FOR POWER TRIPPERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Want to hit the fast track in the '90s? Start packing your bags. 
</P>
<P>
Seems that anybody who is anybody is headed for faraway places, and not just 
for the chance to snooze by themselves on a white-sand beach. No way. They're 
leaving it all behind to be with people of their own kind to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Take developer Peter B. Rothschild of Newport Beach. Last weekend, the CEO of 
Rothschild Industries left town to pave the way for about 250 members of the 
Young Presidents Organization to attend a "university" beginning near Montego 
Bay, Jamaica, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Members, who must be no older than 40 when they become top gun of a company 
(typically, a company with a minimum of $5 million in annual sales) will attend 
classes during the day and spend evenings partying at the Half Moon Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
The learn-then-play concept is nothing new for the Young Presidents 
Organization, founded in 1950. But it's a travel concept -- call it 
power-tripping -- that is being used more and more by local leadership groups. 
Doors open wider when movers and shakers arrive, en masse, so why not go for 
it? 
</P>
<P>
The reason doors open, says Craig McDaniel, director of marketing and 
communications for the organization in Dallas, is that members have access to 
the people who control those doors and access to the kind of experts the 
organization likes to present at their "universities." 
</P>
<P>
"We're known for drawing the creme de la creme of business and politics as 
'faculty members,' " McDaniel says. (Former President Richard M. Nixon was 
invited to speak at the Jamaica conference. Young Presidents Organization 
member Al Baldwin of Emerald Bay offered to fly him there in his private jet. 
But Nixon's phlebitis condition prevented him from making the trip.) 
</P>
<P>
Influential women on the move include members of the Angels of the Arts, a 
support group that has raised $2.5 million for the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center since it was founded in 1983. "We're looking to do 
cultural-educational trips because it gives our members an opportunity to see 
theater and art from another perspective," says Angels President Judie Argyros, 
wife of Forbes 400 developer George Argyros. 
</P>
<P>
On the drawing board for the Angels: a trip to Manhattan that would include 
visits to art museums, theaters, and behind-the-scenes peeks at such Big Apple 
landmarks as Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a survey with our client base last fall," says Linda McIntosh, 
president of International Travel Specialties in Irvine. "We asked them: 'If 
you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?' 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty percent of them told us they weren't interested in just taking trips, 
they wanted to travel with a purpose. If they were going to go to Nepal, for 
example, they wanted to go with a special-interest group eager to explore 
Nepal's culture." 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh, who is helping the Angels plan their trip, thinks the reason local 
power groups are beginning to travel together is because they are maturing. 
"They've joined a group with goals they believe in. They've found they have 
loads in common. It only follows they would want to travel with them," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the chance to explore the arts, the Angels would enjoy the chance to 
"get to know each other and their spouses better," Argyros says, "to talk Angel 
shoptalk, to tell a good joke or two. It's the quality time together that 
ultimately sells the idea of a cultural trip away from home." 
</P>
<P>
"People love to travel with friends," says Ginny Ueberroth, co-chairwoman of 
the Los Angeles Music Center's $25,000-per-person Silver Anniversary trip to 
Lanai, Hawaii next month. "I think some people have a little trouble with 
traveling. Being with friends and being taken care of on a tour makes it more 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The trip, which will mark the grand opening of David Murdock's new 102-room 
Lodge at Koele, will offer more fun than education (sunset receptions, garden 
teas, barbecues, helicopter rides, formal dinners). But the happy campers, who 
will include Sidney Sheldon, Henry Mancini, Dina Merrill and Michael York, will 
relax knowing that their megabucks helped educate others about the theater 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my jobs was getting locals from Orange County to go on the trip," says 
Ueberroth, who lives with her husband, Peter Ueberroth, in Emerald Bay. "But 
most of the people I know were loyal to the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. I do think the interest between the two centers has increased. And I 
think this is important. We're going to have to be working together to attract 
certain groups and programs." 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth doffs her hat to Murdock. "It was a great idea, inviting donors to 
his island. He's done so much for the Music Center. It's going to be 
marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
About 25 local movers and shakers are lining up to go to Germany and France on 
March 10 with Don R. Roth, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
Roth has invited influential friends and associates to join him when he 
inspects high-speed train technology, which could be used on a rail line 
between Anaheim and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Gus Owen, president of the Lincoln Club, is trying to find room in 
his and wife Kathryn Thompson's hectic schedule to make the trip. "It would be 
exciting to see the innovation other countries have come up with to solve their 
transportation problems," he says. For Owen, the plus of power trips is the 
chance to "meet with people you would not have the ability to meet with if you 
were on a trip by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"Bringing transportation experts together for one person would be difficult. 
But with a number of community leaders present, people have a greater reason to 
sit down and chat, explain how they accomplished what they did. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have powerful people arriving together at one time, it's rare that 
you can't get other powerful people together at the same time."

THE WAYNE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE IN THE SHADOW OF THE DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was the biggest box office attraction in motion picture history, his heroic 
screen image already gaining mythic proportions when John Wayne and his family 
moved to Newport Beach in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor tour boats would regularly stop in front of the sprawling Wayne house, 
passengers straining to catch a glimpse of the aging Ringo Kid sitting out on 
his patio. And while he would privately grouse, "Hell, I have to wear my wig -- 
I can't even come out in my front yard," he'd always wave and shout hello. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was a member of Hollywood royalty, the Duke never lost the common 
touch. Contrary to his tough-guy image, he would often take his young children 
-- Aissa, Marisa and Ethan -- to school and pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
Or he'd take them for drives along Coast Highway in his olive-green station 
wagon with the custom roof raised to accommodate his 6-foot-4 stature, 
frequently stopping at a Sav-On drugstore where, as always, he would graciously 
oblige requests for autographs as he shopped. 
</P>
<P>
A decade after his death in 1979 at age 72, the man eulogized as a genuine 
American folk hero still casts a bigger-than-life shadow -- a shadow that 
hovers over the lives of the Wayne family, the keepers of the legend. 
</P>
<P>
It's the allure of the Wayne name that caused the international media to focus 
on Aissa Wayne, 33, when she and her then-boyfriend, millionaire financier 
Roger Luby, were brutally attacked by two gunmen who threatened to kill them 
inside Luby's gated Newport Beach home in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The media undoubtedly will turn out in force again in March when Aissa Wayne is 
scheduled to testify at the trial of her ex-husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, who 
is accused of ordering the attack. 
</P>
<P>
She and Gionis, a Pomona orthopedic surgeon, were embroiled in a bitter custody 
dispute over their young daughter at the time. The unusual nature of the crime 
-- "hit men" in Newport Beach -- and the draw of the Wayne name also prompted 
"several people" to approach her about writing a book about the attack. But, 
she insists, "there is no way I'd ever write about that." 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Wayne, 27, who is following in his father's profession, must endure the 
inevitable comparisons with him that his half-brother, Patrick Wayne, faced 
early in his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
And it's the attraction of the Wayne name, in part, that prompted publicity-shy 
Ethan Wayne, currently co-starring in a remake of the "Adam 12" television 
series, to elope to Prescott, Ariz., in December with his longtime girlfriend, 
flight attendant Gina Rivadeneyra. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want any sort of news coverage," he said. "I mean it's not like Sean 
Penn and Madonna, but we didn't want it to even be in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Marisa Wayne, 23, the child of John and Pilar Wayne who maintains the lowest 
public profile, abandoned her acting after five years of on-and-off study and 
is now married to former Olympic skier Jace Romick. They live on a 42-acre 
ranch in Steamboat Springs, Colo., where he owns a small furniture company and 
she is a health and fitness major at Colorado Mountain College. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Peruvian-born Pilar Wayne, the late actor's third wife, who 
amicably separated from her husband in 1973 after 19 years of marriage, a 
relationship she chronicled in her 1987 book "John Wayne: My Life With the 
Duke." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pilar's house is now the primary Wayne home in Newport Beach, tour 
boats continue to stop at the old "John Wayne house," which has changed hands 
twice since it was sold in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as one tour boat captain said, "still probably the most popular point of 
interest in Newport." 
</P>
<P>
She calls it La Roca (the rock), from a biblical passage referring to the 
importance of living life with a solid foundation of faith. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar Wayne's opulent two-story French country home, complete with a tennis 
court reached via a spiral staircase, sits at the end of a cul-de-sac 
overlooking upper Newport Bay, a bird sanctuary with a primeval look despite 
the expensive homes ringing its steep cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
Framed family pictures, many of John Wayne with his children, accent the 
spacious living room, which overlooks a spa and narrow lap pool. But it is the 
oak-accented den off the home's grand, marble-floored entry where friends and 
family usually gather. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a leather skirt and bright yellow blouse, Pilar Wayne entered the 
den with Gucci, her talkative green Amazon parrot, perched on her hand. She put 
the bird in an ornate antique brass cage near a window and sat down next to the 
marble and oak fireplace to talk of her family. 
</P>
<P>
At least she tried to talk. Gucci, who has cages in nearly every room of the 
house and follows "mommy" everywhere, immediately began talking non-stop in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to join in the conversation," Pilar said, no sooner scolding the bird 
when Thor, her 3-month-old Norwegian elkhound, padded into the room and started 
yapping. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't live without a dog," she said, digging into a tin on the glass coffee 
table and dropping a handful of popcorn on the floor for Thor. "Sometimes, Duke 
and I had four." 
</P>
<P>
References to her husband turn up constantly in Pilar Wayne's conversation, and 
the den is filled with various John Wayne mementos: a portrait of him in his 
trademark cowboy garb, a bronze bust, and a commemorative John Wayne Winchester 
rifle and Colt revolver. 
</P>
<P>
Even the game table in the den's windowed alcove, where Pilar plays bridge with 
friends twice a week, is a reminder of Wayne, who taught her how to play 
shortly after they moved to Newport. 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't working, John Wayne loved to play chess, bridge and backgammon. 
He also liked to watch football on television and, true to legend, drink with 
cronies. His widow, however, downplays his reputation as a carouser. 
</P>
<P>
"Duke was the kind who would love a good argument, a good cognac and a good 
cigar," she recalled. But at that stage of his life he mostly enjoyed the kids, 
she said. "He was a very good family man." 
</P>
<P>
An old-fashioned husband -- in her book she calls him her "beautiful 
19th-Century man who couldn't adapt to the '70s" -- John Wayne loved making 
movies and often made one after another, usually in distant locations. It was 
his insistence that his wife and children accompany him on location, despite 
being uprooted from their home and friends, that led to their separation in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar Wayne moved out of the waterfront house in the exclusive Bayshores 
section of Newport Beach, which she likened to "living in a fishbowl," and into 
a condominium they owned in nearby Big Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Although they lived apart the last six years of John Wayne's life, she makes a 
point of saying "there was not a legal separation or anything, and we were 
certainly friends until the bitter end." 
</P>
<P>
She is, she acknowledged, proud of the Wayne name. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, absolutely," she said. "It meant more to me not that he was big and 
famous and everything else, but he was such a wonderful human being. That man 
maybe was not perfect, but he was about 80% perfect. I liked the way he handled 
himself. I liked the way he treated people." 
</P>
<P>
Still a key figure in the society columns, Pilar Wayne lends her name to 
numerous charity events. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as politically active as her notoriously outspoken late husband, 
she agreed to let the Republican Party of Orange County use her home for a 
$1,000-per-couple, fund-raising cocktail reception last night for U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson in his campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Duke and I have always supported the Republican Party, like most of Orange 
County, I guess," she explained. For their part, local Republicans were not 
about to miss a chance to make political hay from the enduring appeal of the 
film star's name, announcing that the reception would be held "in the beautiful 
upper Newport Bay home of Mrs. John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
With income from the interest on a trust established for her during their 
marriage, she doesn't need to work. But staying active is important to Pilar 
Wayne, who owned a small restaurant in Corona del Mar for five years in the 
'70s and has written one cookbook and is working on two more. 
</P>
<P>
She was married briefly in 1984 to Municipal Judge Stephen Stewart (a "two-week 
mistake," she has called it) but is not currently dating anyone steadily. 
"There's nothing serious in my life right now except Thor and Gucci," she said. 
At this point in her life, she has no intention of marrying again. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," she said with a laugh. "I really don't think marriage for me is 
necessary. I had a wonderful marriage with the Duke and he was a complete 
gentleman. It was a long marriage. We have three very beautiful children. 
They're great kids." 
</P>
<P>
She visits Marisa in Colorado frequently, and both Ethan and Aissa, who have 
homes within a mile of their mother, stop to see her several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar, who revealed that her son eloped shortly after all three of her children 
-- and 200 friends -- gathered at her house for a Christmas party last month, 
admits that she was "really hurt" when he didn't tell her that he was getting 
married. "But he married a beautiful girl, so we're very happy for him," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids have to find themselves. I've been very lucky with all my three kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Marisa is married and very happy. Ethan, I never knew what he was going to do, 
but he is 27 years old now and he has settled down. He cares about the family 
and he comes over and he calls. Then my oldest daughter went through that thing 
-- that Gionis thing, which is still pending. She came through that very 
nicely, very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Pilar describes the 1987 attack on her daughter and Roger Luby as "terrible, 
terrible. I can't imagine anybody doing a thing like that." 
</P>
<P>
During the attack inside Luby's garage, the two gunmen struck Luby in the head 
with a handgun, bound him and slashed one of his Achilles tendons. Aissa 
Wayne's forehead was bashed against the garage floor, her hands bound behind 
her and a gun held to her head. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Aissa Wayne moved into her mother's house and stayed with her 
for three months. "I wouldn't leave her alone for a second," Pilar Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Police originally speculated that the attack was a warning directed at Luby. It 
wasn't until six months after the incident that Gionis was arrested, 
investigators maintaining that his intense fear of having to give up his and 
Aissa Wayne's daughter, Anastasia, drove him to direct the attack as a warning. 
At his arraignment, Gionis entered a plea of not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Gionis, who had proposed to Aissa under her father's statue at John 
Wayne Airport, had been granted custody of his daughter a few months before his 
arrest. Since the arrest, he has been granted monitored visitations with 
Anastasia, who now lives with her mother. Custody of the child will be reviewed 
after Gionis' criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Aissa Wayne, who shares custody of her two older children from a previous 
marriage to tennis pro Lornie Kuhl of Del Mar, said she experienced nightmares 
and sleepless nights after the attack and has talked to a therapist "about the 
fear part of it." She said she wasn't "really scared" immediately after the 
incident, "but as time has gone on I'm more and more scared. I don't know why. 
They say it sometimes takes a while for something to really hit you." 
</P>
<P>
Aissa, who is studying to renew her real estate license, said her mother has 
been "my best support in the whole world. She's real strong." 
</P>
<P>
But Aissa said that throughout the ordeal she often wondered what it would have 
been like if she still had her father to turn to. She said that at times "when 
I really want to talk to him," such as when "the judge gave Anastasia to her 
dad and I was just lost," she has visited her father's unmarked hilltop grave 
in Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Aissa said that as she was growing up "he was always the one that got us out of 
jams and protected us and everything. He was security for all of us and if we 
needed help at school or something, my dad always had good, sound advice." 
</P>
<P>
Aissa remembers that when she was a teen-ager her father was strict. "He sat 
down and really talked to us, but he wasn't so unreasonable that you couldn't 
even talk to him about something. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real support day-to-day, so you never got too out of line," she 
laughed, "because he was around. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing my dad used to say was, 'I worked 50 years for my reputation,' so I 
was always really scared if we'd go out and sneak a beer or something. I would 
be really scared (and say) 'we've got to make sure the cops aren't going to 
come.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ethan said that when he was a teen-ager his father "knew if we had been 
drinking or doing something. I did a lot of stuff -- you just do silly things 
when you're a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he knew it was like a phase you were going through. He'd come in 
and look at me and say, 'God, kid, you're a mess.' . . . He didn't have to say 
much more than that. He got his point across." 
</P>
<P>
The "Adam 12" star, who has done several public service announcements against 
drugs and alcohol, said his father's way of getting the message across worked: 
"I'm certainly not involved in anything like that. I'm pretty 
health-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ethan made his screen debut at 8 playing his father's kidnaped 
grandson in "Big Jake," he never considered an acting career until after his 
father died and stuntman friends of his father, who knew Ethan raced 
motorcycles, asked him to work on a picture. 
</P>
<P>
From stunt work he slowly made the transition into acting, and after appearing 
in several low-budget films he landed a recurring role in the soap opera "The 
Bold and the Beautiful." Last fall he began filming "Adam 12." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pilar Wayne said she sees some of her husband's screen mannerisms in 
her son, Ethan doesn't view his career as a case of following in his dad's 
sizable boot steps. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very different," he said. "I don't know how many people compare Lloyd 
Bridges with Jeff Bridges. They're just different." 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up witnessing the great attention his father received wherever he 
went, Ethan wants nothing to do with that aspect of celebrity. He remembers 
times when his father couldn't buy a tube of toothpaste without being stopped 
repeatedly for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
And he remembers the tour boats that would pull up to their house. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was outside he'd wave, but I sit here and start to think: 'Man, it's 
ridiculous what people do. I don't know how they (celebrities) put up with it.' 
With me, it's on such a small scale. I'm still kind of a private person. I 
don't go out a lot. It's hard to get me to talk even. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the acting business, but that's the hard thing. I want to be famous for 
making good movies, not for having people hang around." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's older and involved with "people that are in an upward race to 
make money and have a Porsche or Mercedes or some bull like that, I think back 
and my dad could have had whatever he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"But he'd have been just as happy on a farm or ranch -- or on the boat. He was 
just down to earth. He loved that green station wagon that was so ugly. He 
didn't get involved in any of the hype. He knew he was a good person, and he 
was comfortable with that and he didn't need to have the first spot at the 
(Balboa) Bay Club. He didn't let himself get caught up." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ethan stayed with Patrick Wayne last fall while working on "Adam 12," 
and Patrick has visited Marisa in Colorado, John Wayne's four older children 
from a previous marriage seldom get together with his three children by Pilar. 
</P>
<P>
While John and Pilar Wayne's children said they are grateful that they can 
still see their father in his old movies, it is the man, not the legend, that 
they remember. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great dad," said Marisa, recalling times that he would take her to 
the Balboa Fun Zone to ride the Ferris wheel and bumper cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was 13 when he died, she said that "the 13 years I had with him 
were great years and good memories. A lot of people think because I was so 
young I wouldn't remember him. But I think in the back of his mind he realized 
that he might die when I was young and compensated by spending more time with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
When Ethan remembers his father, he usually thinks of the times that the family 
would take trips to Alaska and Mexico on the Wild Goose, John Wayne's 136-foot, 
converted World War II minesweeper. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just so happy, just to be able to relax," Ethan recalled. "He had to 
put up with so much in town, it was his place he could be himself." 
</P>
<P>
Ethan said his fondest memories are of standing on the bow of the Wild Goose, 
his arm around his dad. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd just stand out there, going out on the ocean," he said. "The ocean looked 
like 'Victory at Sea.' We'd just hang out there and look around. I miss that."

<P>
Sue Harmon dashes into a dressing room at The Fashion Statement in Santa Ana 
with her latest catch: a black-and-white polka-dot suit that will cost her only 
one penny -- if she buys a red striped suit by Jones of New York for $149. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, she emerges from the dressing room resplendent in her polka 
dots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my penny suit," she says. "I'm really paying $70 each for two outfits. 
My husband can't cry over that." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon makes it her business to hunt for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Huntington Beach woman publishes "Hidden Values," a directory 
of outlet and discount merchants in Orange County who sell everything from 
bridal gowns to Bibles at below-retail prices. The booklet includes ads for 
discount clothing, perfume, lingerie, men's suits, jewelry and miscellaneous 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
In compiling the guide, Harmon faces an unusual occupational hazard: She could 
go broke snapping up bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be really good," she says. "It's very difficult not to shop. You 
really have to direct your time." 
</P>
<P>
Like a shopping sleuth, Harmon hunts down off-price stores, resale shops and 
authentic factory outlets, where manufacturers sell their overrun or off-season 
merchandise directly to shoppers, eliminating any middleman markups. 
</P>
<P>
"Some outlets are really hidden," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Often they are tucked away in a corner of a warehouse in an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
She tracks them down through tips from other outlet owners, or by cruising 
around the parks in her car, searching for signs of the boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my friends know I do this so I find out about the stores through word 
of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
That's how she discovered Newport Blue, one of her favorite outlets for men's 
sportswear that operates out of a chained-off section of the manufacturer's 
warehouse in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, who also shops for her husband and 16-year-old son, picks through racks 
of tank tops for $4.99, cotton shorts for $8.99, and striped sweat shirts 
marked $4.99 that still have their original price tags of $21.99. 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like this I have a hard time passing up," she says, fingering one of the 
sweat shirts. 
</P>
<P>
With deals like these, outlets must be careful about throwing open their doors 
to the public. They set up the outlets in out-of-the-way places and keep a low 
profile to avoid taking business away from their clients, the retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons my job has been so tough is the manufacturers don't want to 
compete with their clients," Harmon says. "A lot of them don't want to be known 
because it would hurt their business, so they don't advertise." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Blue, for instance, had to close its larger factory outlet because "we 
were doing too well. We were starting to hurt our accounts," says Deborah 
Williams, outlet manager. 
</P>
<P>
Still, manufacturers want to sell off leftover merchandise. Williams decided to 
promote her outlet in the "Hidden Values" directory because the small 
publication provides just enough publicity to attract shoppers without 
competing with retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the few hours we're open and our location, we're doing great 
business," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon works hard to persuade outlet owners to advertise in her guide. 
Pretending not to see the "no solicitations" sign taped on the door of Two 
Potato, a maker of casual cotton clothing for women that is located in Tustin, 
she ventures inside and introduces herself to the few employees absorbed in 
paper work. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's her sweet, Southern accent or outgoing personality, she soon has a 
worker giving her a tour of Two Potato's factory outlet. It's nothing fancy, 
just a roped-off section of the clothing manufacturer's warehouse with a 
concrete floor and racks of colorful clothes. Harmon checks the price tags: $5 
for cotton skirts, $11 for shorts. She's sold. Before leaving, she asks for the 
name of the outlet owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to work on them harder," she says, tucking his card in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
There's an outlet for almost everything, if one knows where to find it. Harmon 
buys her dressy clothes at Sutter Place and her slips at Lingerie for Less, 
both in Huntington Beach. She buys her suits at The Fashion Statement and her 
son's shorts and T-shirts at PCH Clothing Co. in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
She never shops in malls or department stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed some people pay those prices. There are very few things you can't 
buy at a discount. A suit would have to be extraterrestrial for me to pay $150 
to $200 for it." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the survival of her business, she's stopped bagging every 
bargain she sees. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn that everything is not for you. Some things are too old and some are 
too young," she says. "I think of clothing more as a necessity now. You have to 
have clothes for work and recreation. It's wonderful when you can find them at 
a good bargain." 
</P>
<P>
She distributes 12,000 copies of her guide a month to assorted outlets, hotels 
and discount stores. After one year in operation, the guide now runs 16 to 24 
pages, and Harmon hopes to make it as successful as its 80-page parent 
directory in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>

following outlets (eight of Harmon's hidden values):

DESIGNER PUTS FAMILY AHEAD OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designing bridal gowns can leave one with very firm opinions on marriage and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask New York designer Carolina Herrera, who created Caroline Kennedy's 
much-copied wedding gown and has been manufacturing a bridal collection for 2 
1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera believes a woman can have it all -- career and family. But if she's 
smart, she'll have her family first. 
</P>
<P>
Family is 'the most important thing in life. For a woman, even one who wants to 
be in business, first you have to try and have a family and children. . . . 
That's the role of women in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush-era family values have trickled up to Herrera's bridal customers, who are 
typically 23 to 25 and well to do. Herrera's bridal collection, which can be 
identified immediately by simple round necklines, short sleeves ("like a 
T-shirt") and full ballet-dancer skirts, retails between $2,500 and $7,500 at 
Bullocks Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
'I have heard lots of young girls who are getting married saying, 'Let me take 
care of my house and husband first.' It's not, 'I'll take one week off, go back 
to work and in 10 years I'll think if I want to have a baby.' I don't see that 
anymore. I think they're doing it in a different way now." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, a Venezuelan socialite who grew up wearing made-to-order clothes, 
started her business in 1981. Since then, she has put her imprimatur on 
perfume, women's ready-to-wear, and, starting this season, sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
But she maintains that "if I had to leave my business for my family I'd do it 
in five seconds -- in two seconds. My family comes first." 
</P>
<P>
Although she hasn't had to test that principle, she did have to put another of 
her tenets to work when one of her daughters, Anna Luisa, 25, was married last 
fall in New York. The designer made sure she didn't interfere with Anna Luisa's 
vision of how she would look on her wedding day, even though she, Herrera, 
would be making the dress. Anna Luisa "had very definite ideas," Herrera said. 
"She wanted a big skirt with a big tulle train and she didn't want to have very 
big shoulders and she wanted ribbons in her hair," instead of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for a mother, it's very important to let the daughter decide what she 
wants to wear because it's the most important day of her life," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always like it when the girls come in by themselves," she added, referring 
to her made-to-order clientele. Usually, they bring their mothers in for the 
initial meeting, and the second time they come alone. "That's easier," Herrera 
admitted.

A VERY ABLE DISABLED REPORTER; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: WHEELCHAIR-BOUND NPR REPORTER JOHN HOCKENBERRY FINDS HIS HANDICAP CAN BE 
AN ASSET IN COVERING A STORY.

Covering the Palestinian uprising from a wheelchair, in hilly towns with bumpy 
alleyways or in cramped refugee camps with sand for streets, was a daunting 
prospect for radio reporter John Hockenberry, although every once in a while 
his disability brought a minor advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, for instance, Israeli soldiers on guard against intrusive reporters 
just didn't bother stopping a guy in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shocking how invisible someone in a wheelchair can be. Soldiers just 
don't pay attention to you. In a curfew, when no one else is allowed on the 
street, I could just roll by. It's unnerving," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Hockenberry has just completed an assignment for National Public Radio as its 
Jerusalem-based correspondent and returned to the United States to anchor 
"Heat," a new talk, interview and satire show that NPR will air five nights a 
week beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
His remarkable mobility in difficult conditions made him something of a legend 
not only among reporters in Israel but among the growing legion of Palestinian 
wounded and disabled who saw in Hockenberry an inspirational figure on an 
otherwise bleak future horizon. How, the maimed youth would sometimes ask 
visiting reporters out of the blue, does this guy in a wheelchair get around 
like he does? 
</P>
<P>
Hockenberry lost the use of his legs in an auto accident 14 years ago. Once a 
student of mathematics and music, he describes "stumbling" into journalism 
first as a free-lance writer for magazines, then on sudden assignment for NPR 
covering the Mt. St. Helen's volcano. Shortly after the eruption, he was hired 
full time by NPR and volunteered for the Middle East in March, 1988. "The 
uprising was at its height and I had been trying to get the position for the 
longest time," Hockenberry says. "So they sent me." 
</P>
<P>
As for getting around in the rough and tumble of the intifada, as the uprising 
is called in Arabic, Hockenberry speaks of infinite improvisation -- and help 
from his interview subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how it is in Palestinian villages. There are always a hundred people 
around to help -- carry me up staircases and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, the help would evaporate. Once he was working a crowd at the 
Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip when suddenly the crowd disappeared. 
Soldiers had come and lowered their rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"There I was, all alone. It was a spooky situation. They didn't shoot," 
Hockenberry says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Hockenberry also covered the Ayatollah Khomeini's funeral in Tehran last year. 
He arrived near the city by helicopter and had to rely on a group of mourners 
to roll him out of a dirt field where he was stuck. One of the Iranians then 
commandeered an ambulance to ferry him about the fervent crowd of a million at 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying that the ambulance should be used for the mourners. People were 
fainting all over the place. The Iranians kept saying, 'No, the ambulance is 
just for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hockenberry, 33, spent Christmas in Romania to cover the overthrow of communist 
dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu. The car trip into the country from Yugoslavia was a 
fright ride, he says. Edgy militias who manned checkpoints along the way kept 
fingering their World War I vintage rifles and demanding that he get out of the 
car; he repeatedly pointed to the wheelchair to explain why he couldn't comply 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
A carton of Marlboros to a helpful guide won Hockenberry a safe trip to a 
Bucharest hotel through the maze of bullets in the Romanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Hockenberry would sometimes seek out Palestinians disabled by 
bullets and offer friendly advice, even if only by example. Therapy for 
crippled Palestinians is primitive at best. 
</P>
<P>
"They are left to pray for miracles," Hockenberry says. "They sacrifice so much 
and are rotting away." 
</P>
<P>
He once visited Mokassed, the main Arab hospital in Jerusalem, and came across 
a paralyzed boy who wanted to know how to get from his chair to the bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it myself to show him. He looked hard at what I was doing. Believe me, 
when you need that kind of information. You are like a sponge. You soak up 
everything," he says. "In this job, I learned you can handle just about 
anything in a wheelchair. Of course, you're tired at the end of the day."

KIDS' TV GETS MORE VIOLENT, STUDY FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SATURDAY- MORNING CARTOONS AVERAGE A VIOLENT ACT NEARLY EVERY OTHER 
MINUTE, ACCORDING TO A THREE-YEAR STUDY BY ANNENBERG SCHOOL.

A "violence profile" of network programs released here Thursday reported that 
violence in children's television programming climbed dramatically during the 
past three years, while prime-time levels remained high but unchanged from 
earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"For most viewers, television's mean and dangerous world tends to cultivate a 
sense of relative danger, mistrust, dependence and -- despite its supposedly 
'entertaining' nature -- alienation and gloom," concluded the report, conducted 
under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of violent acts in prime time remains a steady five to six each hour, 
while about half of all major characters are involved in violence and 10% in 
killing, the study found. Such figures have remained about the same since the 
researchers compiled their first "violence profile" in 1967, defining 
"violence" as "overt and explicit physical acts or threats of hurting or 
killing in any context." 
</P>
<P>
Figures rose dramatically for children watching Saturday morning cartoons, who 
on the average saw an unparalleled 26.4 violent acts or more each hour, the 
survey found, compared to 18.6 per hour before 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers blamed the escalating violence in part on the federal 
government's move in the early 1980s to deregulate the broadcasting industry, 
but also on the networks' penchant for action-oriented programming. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing severe damage to our people through television violence," said 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who introduced the research findings at a Capitol 
Hill press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Simon is trying to gather support for his Television Violence Act, a bill that 
would encourage, but not require, the three networks to set common standards on 
the level of violence in their programming. NBC, CBS and ABC have fought 
Simon's measure as a threat to their First Amendment rights to determine 
program content as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the three major networks declined to comment on the findings 
released Thursday, saying they had not yet seen the study. Network officials in 
the past have taken issue with the methodology used in compiling the "violence 
profile" data. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that CBS was the most violent of the three networks in prime 
time from 1986 to 1989, showing an average of 5.1 violent incidents per hour in 
the 1986-87 season, 6.9 in 1987-88 and 7.3 in the last TV season. In 
comparison, NBC showed 4.1 such incidents per prime-time hour in 1986-87, 3.2 
in 1987-88 and 5.7 in 1988-89; ABC's violence index was recorded as 6.6, 5.1 
and 5.3, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Signorielli, an associate professor in the University of Delaware's 
communications department and co-director of the yearly study, said 
violence-saturated programming can influence viewers' personalities, 
particularly among children -- deadening compassion for others' suffering, 
exaggerating fear of other people, and even promoting a greater willingness to 
be violent themselves. 
</P>
<P>
George Gerbner, a professor in the Annenberg School of Communications and the 
study's co-director, called violence "a cheap ingredient" used in programs to 
make a profit with minimum creative and financial investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence is imposing itself on producers and directors because it's cheap," 
Gerbner said, contending that viewers cannot exercise their right to avoid 
"entertaining murders" and otherwise violence-laden programs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can change the channels, but you do not have a choice. We are born into 
it," he said. "Like the wallpaper on the wall, you absorb its pattern without 
even knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
Gerbner noted that children's shows are rife with humorous abuse of characters, 
the humor serving as "sugar coating" for destructive "messages of power." He 
emphasized that children watch an average of 27.3 hours of TV each week. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's bill, versions of which have been passed by both the House and Senate, 
would grant the three networks a limited three-year immunity from the Sherman 
Anti-Trust Act, which now prevents network officials from meeting to coordinate 
broadcasting strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has tried since 1984 to pass the measure. This session of Congress offers 
the best prospect so far of approval, following the House's 399-18 vote in 
favor last August. 
</P>
<P>
A potential stumbling block remains, however, in reconciling the Senate and 
House versions. Before the Senate unanimously passed the bill last May, Sen. 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) was able to amend the scope of the bill to target not only 
TV violence but also "glorified" depictions of drug use and violent or 
promiscuous sexuality. The House version only addresses violence. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for NBC, CBS and ABC say Simon's bill threatens their right to set 
program content without government interference. They point to Simon's veiled 
threats -- that if the bill passes and the networks still refuse to set a 
policy on TV violence, "other measures" will have to be considered -- as a sign 
of Congress' intent to act as censors of taste. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasters also fear possible legal retaliation if they act in concert to set 
policy on children's shows, as has happened in the past, noted Susan Kraus, 
vice president of media affairs for the National Assn. of Broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern we see with the bill (is that) although it provides anti-trust 
exemption, it can't provide assurances that broadcasters won't be sued on 
constitutional grounds," Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
Self-policing is the only responsible policy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is up to each individual station to determine what's appropriate in their 
community. Different communities can have different standards of 
acceptability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We neither support nor oppose the (Simon) bill," said Beth Comstock, NBC's 
manager of corporate communications. "NBC feels it's unnecessary because we do 
a good job of monitoring our programming. . . . We try to keep a balance with 
all the programming. Excessive violence would not make it on the air." 
</P>
<P>
If Simon's bill passes, however, "We'll attend any meetings as required," she 
said, noting that NBC research shows no connection between televised violence 
and people's attitudes.

INVENTOR HOPES HIS INSTRUMENT CREATES A SONIC BOOM; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: DAN NEILL IS BLOWING HIS OWN HORN OVER THE ONE-OF-A-KIND MUTANTRUMPET. 
HE WILL TAKE HIS INVENTION ON STAGE AT LACE SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE LOURDEAUX, Lourdeaux is a free-lance writer based in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their search for the perfect sound, some musicians turn into inventors. 
</P>
<P>
Take Dan Neill, 31, a New York trumpet player who is noted for his avant-garde 
approach in instrumentation. He is the inventor of the one-of-a-kind 
mutantrumpet: two B-flat trumpets fused together with a trombone slide with a 
smaller bell for wah-wah glissandi. 
</P>
<P>
Neill, whose three-bell creation will be on stage at LACE tonight as part of 
the Winter Sonic Series, uses his creation with electronics and percussion. 
Assisting him Friday will be Don Yallech. 
</P>
<P>
Neill initially got his brass brainstorm in 1981, when he was living in Ohio 
and playing works by Cage and Stockhausen, 20th-Century scores that require 
lightning-fast changes of timbre. Neill, tired of popping mutes in and out, 
phoned repairman Robert Cole, and together the two men tried taking a removable 
bell and sticking it onto a normal trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
But "that was very limited because I wasn't able to play the conventional 
trumpet scale," Neill says. "That's why I needed a second set of valves." 
</P>
<P>
So Neill and Cole performed radical surgery on two student instruments. After 
three days, they were looking at a two-handed trumpet with two bells (one over 
the other) and six valves. Later, Neill added the smaller bell with the 
trombone slide. 
</P>
<P>
The singular advantage of the mutantrumpet, Neill says, is its "rapid timbre 
changes, where I tongue on the instrument very lightly so that it hardly 
speaks. It creates this percussive effect. It saves me from having to handle 
the mute so much. Much less awkward." 
</P>
<P>
For varied effects, "I can have the mute (in one bell) and one bell open, or I 
can have two mutes, which has enabled me to play pieces and do stylistic things 
with glissandi that normally a trumpet would not be capable of doing. There's 
also the possibility of half-valving, where the sound can actually be coming 
out of both bells." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is a fan of the new horn. Thomas Stevens, principal trumpeter 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and a specialist in new music, gives a mixed 
review of the mutantrumpet. "It seems to be a rehash of some past ideas," 
Stevens says. "The second bell is not new, (since) the cornet in the 1920s had 
a second smaller bell with mute." As for the new valve for quarter tones, the 
idea "is about 20 years too late." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Stevens likes a trumpet capable of antiphonal effects. "That's one of 
the few things that brass players heretofore have been unable to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But there is hope for the innovative horn. A German museum has contracted to 
purchase Neill's instrument, priced at about $2,500. In the coming months, 
Neill will order and slightly redesign a new model. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, Neill says the mutantrumpet has stimulated and challenged him as a 
soloist and a composer. The mechanics, despite the goofy appearance, help him 
create "a dialogue of three voices that converse with each other," Neill says. 
"And I use live electronics to extend that. Cage talks about how people should 
practice paying attention to three things at the same time." The result is "a 
unified multisidedness: three bells playing three types of musical ideas, all 
unified in one instrument." 
</P>
<P>
After a few solo experiments, Neill "extended that concept into ensemble 
compositions . . . that combine baroque with rock and country-Western and 
minimalism. I intercut these things very quickly one to the other, and try to 
give the illusion that there are actually three strands of musical thought that 
are going on at all times." 
</P>
<P>
The mutantrumpet can, of course, be played like an ordinary B-flat horn. But 
Neill refuses to bring it along on gigs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I showed up with it in a pit band, it would probably cause an uproar," he 
says.

Philippe Bent's tall, shyly articulated sculpture moves an old '40s idea of 
"drawing in space" into a postmodern dimension. Anchored to the floor with 
teeny tripods, miniature "feet" or small curving shapes, these pieces shoot 
upward as single or double wires -- straight, wavy or curved. 
</P>
<P>
They tend to fizz gently on top, way above your head, like the kind of 
fireworks you set off early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
A nervous, austere brand of whimsy enters into the work of this French artist, 
with its clutch of anthropomorphic, landscape and language referents. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces are related to doodling, to high-tech furniture design, to the work of 
Kandinsky and Miro, and to self-effacing, minimal sculpture. Bent's metal rods 
are covered with resin-soaked cotton wool, which gives them the look of fine 
strings about to snap with the tension of never raising their voices above a 
whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Stonehouse's painted devil heads are a bitter, damaged lot. They chomp on 
cigars, weep blood tears, grow big noses, disappear into tornadoes, spit up 
fountains. Some seem to carry the world's griefs on their shoulders; others 
seem to gloat over the way they've screwed things up. 
</P>
<P>
A young Milwaukee artist, Stonehouse began painting his devils on book pages as 
if in irreverent homage to the tradition of illustrated manuscripts. Animated 
by a pungent humanity akin to that of folk art, these small images are most 
unusual in using a Christian symbol to speak without cant to jaded viewers.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: MOST OF BARBARA STANWYCK'S FINEST PERFORMANCES AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the best movies of veteran screen star Barbara Stanwyck, who died last 
week, have been released on video. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of her quality movies were made between the late '30s and the 
mid-'50s. Here is the cream of that period -- all available on cassette: 
</P>
<P>
"Stella Dallas" (Nelson, 1937). In one of the great no-holds-barred soap operas 
of the 1930s, Stanwyck plays a good-hearted, lower-class woman who consistently 
puts her daughter's happiness ahead of her own. Stella's unsophisticated ways 
-- and horrible taste in clothes -- ultimately cause her social-climbing 
daughter (Anne Shirley) much consternation. Of the great self-sacrificing 
heroines, Stella is in a league with the Gladys George's suffering character in 
the 1937 version of "Madame X" and Bette Davis' spinster in "The Old Maid." 
</P>
<P>
"The Lady Eve" (MCA, 1941). One of the two or three best movies by 
writer-director Preston Sturges. In this hearty romantic comedy, Stanwyck, 
flashing impeccable comic timing in early scenes, plays a card-shark who works 
the ritzy ocean-liner circuit, fleecing wealthy passengers. Her prize prey is a 
shy millionaire (Henry Fonda). However, her con job goes awry when she falls 
for her pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Ball of Fire" (Nelson, 1941). In director Howard Hawks' fast-paced, screwball 
comedy, Stanwyck stars as a tough-talking burlesque dancer who, while running 
from the police, moves in with a group of stuffy professors who are working on 
an encyclopedia. Of course, she falls for one of the scholars (Gary Cooper). 
Even the out-of-control, slapstick ending doesn't really spoil this one. One of 
Stanwyck's comic peaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet John Doe" (Media, 1941). In one of director Frank Capra's more 
sentimental homages to the common man, Stanwyck forcefully portrays a cynical, 
conniving reporter who hatches a plan to turn a naive drifter (Gary Cooper) 
into the leader of a national grass-roots movement. But a corrupt politician 
(Edward Arnold) plots to use the scheme for his own devious purposes. Brimming 
with wartime idealism and cornball Americana. Cooper's performance is really 
the heart of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Double Indemnity" (MCA, 1944). One of the best of the hard-boiled '40s 
melodramas. Stanwyck plays a scheming wife who plans, with a smitten insurance 
agent (Fred MacMurray), to kill her husband and collect the insurance. The 
major obstacle is the agent's clever boss, played by Edward G. Robinson. As 
good as Stanwyck is, she is overshadowed by MacMurray, who gives the best 
performance of his career as the man led astray by illicit passion. The script 
was co-written by detective novelist Raymond Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" (MGM/UA, 1945). This is the wrong season for this 
one, but so what? Stanwyck stars as a columnist who, to save her job, has to 
arrange a cozy Christmas in Connecticut for a soldier (Dennis Morgan). Though 
one of her more obscure movies, Stanwyck's chemistry with Morgan transcends 
anything generated with Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda in more famous romantic 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" (Kartes Video and Congress Video, 1946). 
Terrific performance by Stanwyck as Ivers, a rich, powerful temptress with a 
shady past. Her husband (Kirk Douglas, making his film debut) capitalizes on 
her dark secret. One of the best evil-woman roles of her career, but this one 
is usually neglected by fans and historians in favor of her work in "Double 
Indemnity." 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, Wrong Number" (Paramount, 1948). This showy, somewhat overwrought 
performance was her last good shot at a best-actress Oscar but she lost out to 
Jane Wyman in "Johnny Belinda." Stanwyck plays an obnoxious, bedridden woman 
who torments her husband (Burt Lancaster). Overhearing a murder plot on the 
phone, she figures out that she's the target. 
</P>
<P>
"Executive Suite" (MGM/UA, 1954). Taut, well-written, star-studded drama of 
corporate in-fighting, co-starring William Holden, June Allyson, Fredric March 
and Shelly Winters. Stanwyck is effective in a relatively small role as a 
pivotal stockholder, but it's really Holden's movie. 
</P>
<P>
The best of rest on video: 
</P>
<P>
"Golden Boy" (RCA/Columbia, 1939). Notable as William Holden's debut as a 
leading man, but he is guilty of overacting (as are Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb) 
in this tale of a young man who choses boxing over a career in music. Clifford 
Odets' dialogue now seems laughably overripe. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady of Burlesque" (Video Yesteryear, 1943). Lively suspense comedy about the 
search for a killer who is strangling strippers with their own G-strings. 
</P>
<P>
"Clash by Night" (United, 1952). Moody love triangle with Stanwyck effectively 
playing an unhappy wife. Co-starring Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and, in a 
secondary role, Marilyn Monroe. Very hard to find in video stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Blowing Wild" (Republic, 1953). Underrated, steamy action-adventure tale about 
another love triangle involving an oil baron (Anthony Quinn), his wife 
(Stanwyck) and her ex-lover (Gary Cooper). 
</P>
<P>
"Cattle Queen of Montana" (Buena Vista, 1954). The best thing about this 
routine Western, featuring Stanwyck as a powerful rancher battling Indians and 
crooks, is the spectacular scenery. But it's infamous because it boasts 
possibly the worst performance in the career of co-star Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maverick Queen" (Republic, 1955). Rousing action Western about a feisty 
bad girl (Stanwyck as a saloon owner) falling for a good-guy lawman (Barry 
Sullivan). 
</P>
<P>
Not yet on video but worth seeing if and when available: 
</P>
<P>
"The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (1933), "Always Goodbye" (1938), "Union 
Pacific" (1939), "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" (1938, co-starring Humphrey Bogart), 
"The Furies" (1950), "All I Desire" (1953), "Witness to Murder" (1954), "The 
Violent Men" (1955) and "There's Always Tomorrow" (1956).

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: 'ANDY HARDY' RELEASES A SIX-PACK OF DELIGHTFUL

Well before video, compact discs and rap, the American teen-age boy had to 
struggle with the same, age-old problems of parents, school, girls and how to 
get behind a steering wheel instead of the eight ball. You can see just how the 
most famous fictional teen-ager of the late 1930s and early '40s dealt with 
those dilemmas in several examples from MGM's delightful "Andy Hardy" series, 
released on tape by MGM/UA this week. 
</P>
<P>
These half-dozen fine entries in the popular series, priced at $19.95 each, 
star not only regulars Mickey Rooney, Lewis Stone and Fay Holden, but also 
several young stars who would later achieve fame. 
</P>
<P>
* "Love Finds Andy Hardy" (1938) features no less than Judy Garland (who sings 
three songs), Lana Turner and Ann Rutherford (who also appears in the other 
five, including "Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever," as Andy's girlfriend). 
</P>
<P>
* "Andy Hardy Meets Debutante" (1940) and "Life Begins for Andy Hardy" (1941) 
also star Garland. 
</P>
<P>
* "Andy Hardy's Private Secretary" (1941) has a young Kathryn Grayson (later of 
"Kiss Me Kate" and other musicals). 
</P>
<P>
* "Andy Hardy's Double Life" (1942) features a pre-pool Esther Williams. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, MGM/UA has released these notable oldies for $29.95 each: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Best Man" (1964): a tense political drama based on a Gore Vidal play and 
starring Henry Fonda as the U.S. President. 
</P>
<P>
* "Northwest Passage" (1940): King Vidor's rough and colorful account of 
Colonial America, starring Spencer Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1937): the best version of this often-filmed 
costumer, starring Ronald Colman. 
</P>
<P>
* "Home From the Hill" (1960): A well-made (by Vincente Minnelli) but awfully 
long (151 minutes) Southern-plantation drama starring Robert Mitchum. 
</P>
<P>
The more recent movies new to video this week run from the sublime to the 
(mostly) ridiculous: 
</P>
<P>
* Beginning with the sublime, "New York Stories" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) 
combines relatively short films by three of America's greatest directors. 
Martin Scorsese's "Life Lessons" leads off with a tense, bravura portrait of a 
sick relationship between a painter (Nick Nolte) and his protege (Rosanna 
Arquette). Francis Ford Coppola counters with a light and fairly plotless but 
endearing study of a rich, pubescent daughter of divorced parents. Woody Allen 
ends the set with a hilarious satire on mothers, love and New Age cures. 
</P>
<P>
* And on to the zany: "Uncle Buck" (MCA, $89.95, PG) stars John Candy as the 
world's most irresponsible baby-sitter. Directed by John Hughes, the comedy was 
a surprise big hit, raking in more than $60 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
* "UHF" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) is even sillier, combining the antics of 
singer/satirist Weird Al Yankovic and some far-out cable-TV spoofing. 
</P>
<P>
* "Turner and Hooch" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) bummed out a lot of people with 
the way its cop-and-dog plot ended, but Tom Hanks' star power still pulled in 
$70 million for this comedy/thriller at theaters. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Karate Kid III" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG) didn't do as well as its two 
predecessors at the box office, but still kicked up $39 million. For fans of 
rougher martial arts, there's "Kickboxer" (HBO, $89.99, R), starring Claude Van 
Damme. 
</P>
<P>
* Farrah Fawcett stars in both "See You in the Morning" (Warner, $89.95, 
PG-13), a 1989 theatrical comedy/drama with Jeff Bridges as a man juggling two 
families, and "Between Two Women" (Warner, $79.95), a TV movie about a 
relationship between a woman and her mother-in-law (Colleen Dewhurst, who won 
an Emmy for her performance). 
</P>
<P>
* Despite having Luke Skywalker and Gandhi in its cast -- well, Mark Hamill and 
Ben Kingsley, anyway -- the sci-fi film "Slipstream" (MCEG, $79.95, PG-13) 
slipped through theaters without leaving much of a trace.

NORIEGA CLAIMS POW STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT JUDGE REFUSES TO GRANT BOND

<P>
Deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega claimed status as a prisoner of 
war under the Geneva Convention and asked today to be moved to a neutral third 
country to avoid trial on U.S. drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was mailed to President Bush in a letter signed by Noriega, who 
listed his title as commander-in-chief of the Panamanian Defense Force. A copy 
was contained in a motion filed in federal court today by defense attorney 
Frank Rubino. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the court's jurisdiction, Rubino said he would "respectfully decline" 
to participate in a scheduled pretrial detention hearing. But U.S. District 
Judge William Hoeveler ordered the hearing to continue. As expected, he denied 
bond, ruling that the defense had not rebutted the prosecution's contention 
that Noriega might flee the country if freed on bail. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing opened with Noriega appearing in uniform and Rubino reading his 
motion into the court record. The ousted strongman did not speak. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contended that Noriega, who was whisked out of Panama on Jan. 3 to 
face a 1988 drug indictment in Miami, was a political prisoner captured as the 
result of an illegal military invasion in violation of international 
conventions, treaties and accords. 
</P>
<P>
The motion recounted events leading up to Noriega's arrest outside the papal 
nunciature in Panama City, including American troops' use of high-intensity 
lights and loudspeakers playing rock music. 
</P>
<P>
The judge acknowledged receipt of the motion but called it untimely and said he 
would give the prosecution time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The government, not the defense, had demanded the bond hearing, concerned that 
failure to guarantee Noriega the opportunity could jeopardize their case in 
both the legal and political arenas. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino refused to ask for bond because Noriega does not recognize U.S. 
jurisdiction and, he said earlier, because "I don't file motions I don't expect 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has been held in Miami on drug trafficking charges since his surrender 
to U.S. authorities in Panama on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
His arrest by U.S. agents followed the ousted strongman's surrender from the 
Central American country's Vatican Embassy, where he had fled on Christmas Eve 
after the Dec. 20 invasion by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega and 15 others were charged in a 12-count drug trafficking indictment 
returned Feb. 4, 1988, by a federal grand jury in Miami. If convicted, he would 
face a maximum penalty of 145 years in prison and a $1.1-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which deals with alleged crimes committed between 1982 and 
1986, accuses Noriega of providing protection for cocaine shipments from 
Colombia to the United States in return for $4.6 million from the Medellin 
cartel, which is responsible for about 70% of the cocaine that reaches the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also accuses Noriega of allowing smugglers to set up a 
processing laboratory and letting them deposit profits in Panama banks. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other defendants, five are in the United States awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a Tampa indictment also unsealed Feb. 4, 1988, Noriega and two others are 
charged with arranging to smuggle nearly 1 million pounds of marijuana into the 
United States from 1982 to 1984.

JETLINER APPARENTLY RAN OUT OF FUEL BEFORE CRASH; DEATH TOLL RISES TO 69

<P>
A Colombian jetliner carrying 158 people apparently ran out of fuel before it 
crashed near New York's Kennedy Airport, killing 69 people and critically 
injuring more than 50 others, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The injured, who were pulled from the wreckage of the Boeing 707 Thursday night 
by an army of rescue workers, battled for life as worried relatives awaited 
word on the fate of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 158 people on Avianca Flight 52, officials said at least 69 were dead. 
Another 57 were in critical condition in 10 hospitals with broken bones, deep 
cuts, crushed limbs and other injuries. The other 32 of those aboard were 
hospitalized in fair or stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
None of the injured were burned, and no fire was seen by rescue workers after 
the plane crashed into the wooded hills of this exclusive Long Island suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were examining what caused the flight from Bogota -- via 
Colombia's drug capital of Medellin -- to crash, but it appeared certain that 
the plane crashed without much fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and passengers said the plane had been scheduled to land at 8 p.m. 
but circled for more than an hour before it made its final approach at 9:24 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two so-called "black box" flight recorders were recovered and sent to 
Washington to be studied. 
</P>
<P>
Foul play was not suspected, but federal officials said three of the 
passengers, two of whom died, were carrying cocaine secreted in rubber packets 
in their stomachs. Drug agents said it is not unusual to find cocaine on 
passengers from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
An Avianca jet with 107 aboard exploded in midair two months ago near Bogota 
and drug lords claimed they had put a bomb on the plane, but there were no 
indications that the Long Island crash had anything to do with the drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National Safety Transportation Board arrived early today 
but had no immediate comment on the cause of the crash, which occurred about 15 
miles from New York's Kennedy Airport in fog and rain at 9:34 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur radio operator Anthony Rosati said he heard the pilot's last message as 
he listened to an aircraft scanner. It was a stark: "We have just lost two 
engines. Dumping fuel. Requesting emergency assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the plane, passengers were apparently given no warning. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane went up and up and then it lost control and the plane started 
shaking. The lights went off, and people started to scream," said survivor 
Carlos Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the plane slammed into the wooded area, an alert went out across 
Long Island and nearly 1,000 rescue workers jammed highways to get to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to reach the crash was Dr. Stephen Coyne, the chief of 
radiology at the Community Hospital of Glen Cove. 
</P>
<P>
" 'What am I going into?' I asked myself. I assumed there would be few 
survivors, but I was overwhelmed at how many there were and how many had severe 
fractures, the bones protruding through legs, pretzel-like. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 41, but I just became 61." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and co-pilot died in the crash, and only one of the nine-member crew 
is thought to have survived. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby front lawn of tennis champion John McEnroe's parents became a 
makeshift morgue as bodies were brought there to be covered in white plastic 
body blankets.

LARGEST MEDFLY SPRAYING EFFORT IN O.C. HISTORY IS COMPLETED

The largest malathion spraying operation in Orange County history was completed 
early today after helicopters spent nearly five hours dousing nine cities with 
the pesticide that agriculture officials hope will rid the area of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Five helicopters landed at El Monte Airport at 1:30 a.m. today after dropping 
2,200 gallons of malathion mixture on Cypress, Garden Grove, Westminster, Santa 
Ana, Stanton, Los Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Anaheim and Orange, said Anita 
Brown, a spokeswoman for the state Medfly project. 
</P>
<P>
The spraying began at 8:42 p.m. Thursday, four hours after a Sacramento 
Superior Court judge denied a last-minute appeal to block the spraying for at 
least 10 days. The next round of spraying in the Garden Grove area is scheduled 
Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove City Atty. Stuart Scudder said that before the next round of 
spraying, a hearing will take place in which the state will be asked to "show 
good cause" for the spraying to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the towns involved in Thursday night's spraying started cleaning 
up after the first of what could be a dozen aerial assaults on the 
crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Trudell, a spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District, said 
all schools in the affected area were ordered to cover outside fountains and 
lunch tables with plastic prior to the spraying. This morning, schools that did 
not have the proper materials to cover areas frequented by students hosed down 
school grounds, and all schools with sprinkler systems were ordered to turn 
them on prior to the arrival of students, Trudell said.

CRIME: JONES PHARR III REBUTS COURT TESTIMONY BY FOUR BOYS THAT HE FONDLED THEM 
AT HIS SUMMER CAMP FOR RICH KIDS AFTER THEY WENT SKINNY-DIPPING.

<P>
A textile heir testified today that he often took youngsters from a summer camp 
he ran for rich kids skinny-dipping but never molested them, contrary to the 
claims of four children. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Yorke Pharr III, 41, grandson of the founder of Pharr-Stowe textile 
mills, is on trial in Henderson County Superior Court on two counts of taking 
indecent liberties with minors attending Falling Creek Camp in Tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
Four boys testified against him earlier this week before the defense began 
presenting its witnesses, including Pharr's wife, Barbara, 40, who in response 
to a prosecutor's question said the couple enjoys a "very normal" sex life. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no whips and chains or anything, if that's what you mean," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Pharr said her husband is an "extremely affectionate" man, and 
considered himself a "surrogate father" to the campers. The couple have three 
children of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Pharr testified that he took youngsters on overnight outings during which they 
stripped off all their clothes and went for moonlight swims. But he denied 
fondling or molesting any of them. 
</P>
<P>
He said he, too, skinny-dipped as a youngster attending one of the many camps 
that ring Hendersonville, a picturesque resort community nestled in the Blue 
Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely do not think it (skinny-dipping) is wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pharr said he has taken campers on about 600 overnight trips since he bought 
the camp in 1971 and that one of the camp's selling points was his individual 
attention to the campers, most about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Business was strong because I knew the children and they felt close to me," he 
said. "I gave them that special opportunity to get to know me." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters who testified against Pharr -- a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old 
from West Palm Beach, Fla., and two 10-year-olds from Baltimore and Phoenix -- 
gave nearly identical accounts alleging Pharr took them skinny-dipping, groped 
them and then invited them to share his sleeping bag, during which the alleged 
molestations took place.

Security guards on a domestic Iran Air flight foiled a hijacking and killed all 
four hijackers in a shootout, IRNA news agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, quoting a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, said 
four "armed terrorists" tried to hijack the Boeing 727 Thursday night on a 
flight between the southern cities of Shiraz and Bandar Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards, the internal security force, said all four 
hijackers were killed in a shoot-out with agents who were on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had taken a crew member hostage to force the pilot to fly to an 
unspecified destination. None of the passengers was wounded, and the plane 
returned to Shiraz after the attempt, IRNA said.

President Bush "opposes segregation in any form" but plans to attend social 
functions hosted by two all-male clubs in Washington on Saturday, his spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
As he did last year, the President will attend a luncheon sponsored by the 
Alibi Club, which meets on regular occasions, and the annual dinner of the 
Alfalfa Club, which meets once a year to roast political personalities. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush is attending the two 
functions "for the same reason he did last year -- because he belongs to both 
clubs and enjoys them." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the President should attend a segregated gathering, 
Fitzwater said, "I don't think it's relevant" and added, "The President is 
opposed to segregation in any form."

The United States and France are willing to provide weapons to Lebanese 
President Elias Hrawi, now preparing his troops to replace Syrian soldiers in 
Muslim West Beirut, official sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The sources in Hrawi's government said both countries said they oppose any 
attack to break the hold of defiant Christian Gen. Michel Aoun on the Christian 
enclave and will provide arms only for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The French and American positions were relayed to Hrawi's Finance Minister Ali 
Khalil when he visited Paris and Washington, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The two nations requested details of arms needed by Hrawi's 15,000 mostly

Members of the Soviet Parliament's opposition group condemned the government 
today for failing to quell ethnic violence in the Caucasus and for relying on 
force instead of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani activists, meanwhile, said Soviet troops raided the republic's 
mission in Moscow and arrested a nationalist leader. 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper also reported today that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was warned 
by two senior Soviet military leaders not to send troops into Azerbaijan just 
hours before the soldiers were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen members of the Inter-Regional Group of progressive deputies in the 
Soviet Congress issued a declaration saying authorities took action "too late" 
in the simmering conflict between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
They proposed an emergency session of the Supreme Soviet, the government's 
standing legislature, to mediate the dispute and called for a deadline for the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest and the government's delayed, armed reaction to it "represent a 
threat to perestroika," the Kremlin's program of reforms, Deputy Sergei 
Stankevich said. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani activists said today that police twice raided the Azerbaijani 
government's building in Moscow during the night and arrested a leader of the 
nationalist Azerbaijani People's Front, Ekhtibar Mamedov. 
</P>
<P>
The account was not confirmed by police spokesmen, who said they had not heard 
of any such raid. But a visit by a reporter to the mission revealed several 
broken-down doors and scattered documents in the offices. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku, military commandant Lt. Gen. Vladimir Dubinyak said today the 
situation was "relatively calm," Tass press agency reported. In the last 24 
hours, 147 people had been detained in Baku curfew violations, it said.

Five paid round trips qualify the passenger for two free North American trips 
or one free round trip to anywhere Northwest flies in Europe. Seven paid round 
trips earn three free North American trips or two free round trips to Europe.

TAX-FREE SAVINGS CONSIDERED

The White House has completed a proposal aimed at bolstering the nation's 
lagging savings rate that includes giving tax-free status to some bank deposits 
more than 7 years old, a Bush Administration official confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
The official did not give details, but the New York Times reported that the 
centerpiece of the President's plan is a new account that he hopes will help 
entice middle-class Americans to save more money. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing White House officials, said that initially deposits in 
these accounts would not be tax-deductible in order to not create an immediate 
strain on Treasury coffers. However, if after seven years depositors have 
accumulated sufficient sums, the government would lose the right to tax the new 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is confident that the benefits of a higher national savings rate would in 
time offset the loss caused by making the accounts tax-deductible, the official 
said.

Japanese inflation soared and production growth slumped in 1989, but the 
country still turned in an economic performance that was the envy of most of 
its trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
The government said today that consumer prices jumped 2.3% last year, after 
rising a meager 0.7% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That was the biggest rise since 1984 but still looked small when compared with 
many other nations, including the United States, where inflation is about 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also did better than many of its trading partners in churning out 
products in 1989, even though industrial output grew only 5.9% after surging 
9.5% in 1988. Economists said the slowdown in output growth was to be expected 
after 1988's torrid rise and maintained that the 3-year-old economic upswing 
remains in place.

The struggling Bank of New England borrowed more than $400 million from the

Arthur Meehan, a bank executive vice president, told the Boston Globe and

The Globe estimated the total at $475 million.

One of the region's largest banks, Bank of New England has been hurt by bad 
loans in a weak real estate market and last week posted a $1.2-billion loss for

<P>
After the announcement, hundreds of depositors, including several cities and 
towns across the region, withdrew millions of dollars from their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Boston withdrew $34 million earlier this week.

FOX WANTS FCC TO RELAX NETWORK LAW;

Fox Broadcasting Co. will ask the Federal Communications Commission to allow it 
to develop into a true "fourth network" to compete with NBC, ABC and CBS free 
of rules that restrict network programs and sales. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, in Washington Thursday to press his case on 
Capitol Hill and at the FCC, said his company on Tuesday will ask the 
commission to relax so-called financial interest and syndication rules on 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC defines a network, among other things, as a company that broadcasts at 
least 15 hours of television programs a week. Fox Broadcasting, the scrappy 
three-year-old company that has won a loyal following with such shows as "21 
Jump Street," "Married . . . With Children" and gritty "reality" programs, 
expects to achieve network status in September. 
</P>
<P>
Besides asking the FCC to change the rules -- called fin-syn rules in the 
industry -- Fox also wants a waiver from the 15-hour programming limit so it 
can "continue to grow," Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox also wants the FCC to revise its definition of a network, Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
The fin-syn rules prohibit a TV network from selling to independent stations 
programs that have been presented on the network. They also prohibit a network 
from having a financial interest in programs it does not solely produce. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has been airing its shows on its seven owned stations and is selling them 
to an affiliate "network" and to non-Fox-affiliated stations. The selling to 
non-affiliated stations would stop if Fox qualified as a network. 
</P>
<P>
Fox officials claim the rules are antiquated in an era of multinational media 
conglomerates and that they stifle competition.

A federal bankruptcy judge has delayed plans for an Internal Revenue Service 
auction of property belonging to comedian Redd Foxx, just 24 hours before the 
sale was scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clive Jones issued a 30-day stay of the sale today, 
despite protests by IRS attorneys and the auctioneer involved. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx's attorney, Paul Whitford of Beverly Hills, told the court that the IRS 
sale of the property would conflict with the interests of the Bankruptcy Court. 
Whitford said the issue was "whether provisions of the bankruptcy code override 
provisions of the IRS code." 
</P>
<P>
Foxx, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983, owes the IRS about $900,000 
in back taxes, penalties and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS seized more than 400 items of personal property in a raid on his home 
Nov. 28. The property ranged from his Las Vegas home to antique cars, 
furniture, dozens of pieces of flashy jewelry, posters and photographs.

Clint Eastwood, paying tribute to Sergio Leone at a film festival, said one of 
the joys of working with the late Italian director in the 1960s was that he 
lacked Hollywood's ingrained self-censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"Sergio was not afraid to attack things that were forbidden," Eastwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, you couldn't show a character getting shot. Sergio didn't know 
that, so he went ahead and filmed it." 
</P>
<P>
The two met in 1963, when Eastwood accepted an offer to go to Italy and make "A 
Fistful of Dollars," a Western modeled on Akira Kurosawa's samurai movie, 
"Yojimbo." 
</P>
<P>
The only Italian word Eastwood knew was arrivederci, and the only English Leone 
knew was goodby, the actor told movie buffs Wednesday at the Sundance United 
States Film Festival. As a result, Eastwood said, "I just did my own thing, and 
Sergio went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
One of Leone's trademarks was the extreme close-up, sometimes framing only a 
subject's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors love those tight shots," said Eastwood, 59. "But I was younger then. 
Now I tell them to take the camera back."

Bill is a senior with one year of eligibility remaining and is a native of 
Flemington, N.J. He began the 1989 season as the starting quarterback for the

suspension came one day after he was cited by campus police for an 
alcohol-related incident.

<P>
"I have decided to admit myself, on my own initiative, to an alcohol education 
and rehabilitation facility," Bill said in a statement he wrote and distributed

SUPER BOWL EMOTIONS, ANTICIPATION BUILDING UP;

<P>

RECOVERED FROM FLU, COACH SAYS.

Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves announced today that running back Bobby 
Humphrey, nursing cracked ribs from the AFC title game, will start in Sunday's 
Super Bowl but will need to take a couple of hard hits to determine if he will 
be able to go at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 49ers Coach George Seifert said running back Roger Craig is ready 
after a couple of days with the flu and that nose tackle Michael Carter, who 
injured a foot midway through the regular season, will make his first start 
since then. Seifert said that safety Ronnie Lott's bruised right thigh is still 
aching but that he will also play. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who left practice Wednesday with flu-like symptoms, was suffering from 
some lightheadedness Thursday and stayed in the 49ers' hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Roger needs the work as much as he needed to rest," Seifert said 
then. "It threw off our timing (in selected running drills), but we should be 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Joe Montana, listed on the injury report as probable for Sunday's 
game because of a tender right elbow, seemed unaffected by it as he 
participated in all passing drills Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At today's final meeting of coaches and media before the Broncos take on the 
heavily favored 49ers in Sunday's NFL championship game, Seifert and Reeves 
agreed on one thing: The next two days will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotion before this game is almost indescribable," Seifert said. "A great 
deal of emotion and anticipation goes into this game." 
</P>
<P>
For perhaps the hundredth time this week, Reeves was asked what has become 
known as "the monkey on your back," the fact that Denver lost by wide margins 
in 1987 and 1988, is nearly a two-touchdown underdog this time and would match 
the Minnesota Vikings of a decade ago at 0-4 if it loses Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He replied by citing his experience as a running back with the Dallas Cowboys, 
who from 1966 through 1971 were known as "next year's team," losing narrowly to 
Green Bay in two NFL title games, then losing in overtime in the 1971 Super 
Bowl. They finally broke through with a 24-3 victory over Miami in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert played down the 12 1/2-point spread, called the Broncos "the best team 
we've faced this year" and cited his concerns about the scrambling abilities of 
Denver quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the realization that at some point in the game, he's going to break 
the pocket," Seifert said. "We have to realize that even when he does, we have 
to maintain our coverage." 
</P>
<P>
While the Broncos will be trying to overcome an embarrassing legacy of losses 
Sunday, the 49ers will be motivated by a chance to enshrine themselves in the 
record books. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, with the best record in the National Football League this year, will 
be trying to equal the Pittsburgh Steelers' mark of four Super Bowl wins and 
become the first team to repeat as champions since Pittsburgh in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Following last year's dramatic 20-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, the 
49ers dedicated themselves to winning consecutive championships. They have 
responded with a 14-2 season and two startlingly easy playoff wins. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a chance to make history," star running back Roger Craig said. "Twenty 
or 30 years from now if we win on Sunday, people will remember us, that we 
repeated and won four Super Bowls."

Former Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax will have a hip transplant in 
the next four to six weeks, the NFL team's orthopedic physician said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Russell Chick said the transplant will be done in Los Angeles by himself 
and Dr. Larry Dorr, a hip replacement specialist from California. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax, a Pro Bowl selection in 1984 and 1987, retired last week after nine 
seasons with the Cardinals because of degenerative arthritis in his left hip.

White Sox infielder Carlos Martinez is in a Caracas, Venezuela, jail after his 
arrest on suspicion of hitting a man with a baseball bat, a newspaper reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A native Venezuelan in his second year with the Sox, Martinez was playing 
winter baseball for the LaGuaira Tiburones (Sharks), the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez allegedly went to University Stadium in Caracas with friends and 
relatives last Saturday to watch a baseball game. He got into trouble when he 
tried to get in without paying, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez allegedly argued with Homero Herrera, a stadium guard, who then picked 
up a baseball bat and tried to strike Martinez. Martinez than allegedly grabbed 
the bat and struck Herrera on the arm, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela does not have a bail system, and no decision has been made on whether 
Martinez will be given a trial. Sources said he would probably serve an 
eight-day sentence, the Tribune reported.

TAGLIABUE CALLS RACE BIAS REPORT 'UTTER NONSENSE'

<P>
Paul Tagliabue, unveiling a blunt, to-the-point style today at his first Super 
Bowl news conference as NFL commissioner, called a Washington television 
station's report accusing racial bias in NFL drug testing "a journalistic 
Molotov cocktail." 
</P>
<P>
In his first national exposure as successor to Pete Rozelle, Tagliabue pulled 
no punches. "If you throw enough mud against the wall, some of it might stick," 
the commissioner said of criticism leveled at the league's drug policy and Dr. 
Forest Tennant, the NFL's drug adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue dismissed the WJLA report as "a smear, a gross distortion, utter 
nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a smear in that it did not name people. Until you have facts that make 
it credible, you don't publish the story. If I were still practicing law, I'd 
like to cross-examine some of the people they spoke with." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner dismissed the station's charge that positive drug tests were 
covered up for three white quarterbacks. "Why would the league let a player go 
on with an addiction?" he said. "Why would they think that was doing a player a 
favor?" 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue viewed the report as scattershot. "Watching that report, you might 
think Dr. Tennant was under this podium, testing me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner defended the league's drug policy, saying, "I know enough to 
stand by it in every form." 
</P>
<P>
However, Tagliabue would not issue a blanket endorsement of Tennant's operation 
or say that the doctor would continue to head the drug program. 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Tagliabue said he favors retaining instant replay because he 
believes that fans like it, expects international play to extend to Germany 
with an exhibition game next summer, and hopes for a collective bargaining 
agreement and expansion early in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also said that he is concerned with the length of games, some 
stretching to as long as four hours, and that he intends to impose "stiff 
fines" to control taunting on the field.

DOODLIN TO FACE A TOUGH FIELD TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gusty Stable's Doodlin may be facing the toughest task she's had in quite a 
while as she battles a field of eight in a $10,000 distaff pacing invitational 
tonight at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Also tonight, eight of thoroughbred racing's finest jockeys will try their hand 
at driving rather than riding horses. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion is the All-Star Jockeys Pace, an exhibition harness race featuring 
Laffit Pincay, Chris McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye, Ray Sibille, Gary Stevens, 
Robbie Davis, Alex Solis and Corey Black. The race will benefit the Don MacBeth 
Memorial Jockey Fund, which was created to benefit disabled jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
In post position order, the field for tonight's main attraction: Azurae, Gene 
Vallandingham in the race bike; Set To Go, Jim Lackey; Ja Ja Fajasm, Peter 
Wrenn; Gee Gee Gem, Ross Croghan; French Heritage, Marc Aubin; Solid Bett, Jim 
Butler; Terri S, D. R. Ackerman; Admiral's Rule, Joe Anderson, and Doodlin, 
Rick Kuebler. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational goes as the eighth wagering event on the 12-race program. 
</P>
<P>
Doodlin was impressive last Friday night as she captured a similar race in 
1:58. 
</P>
<P>
Doodlin will have her work cut out for her Friday night as she will start from 
the No. 9 post. The winner of more than $310,000 is capable of scoring from the 
outside slot but will have to be at her best (and not get overly hard used 
early), as many in the field have the credentials necessary for a winning 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Kuebler will have to make his decision immediately after the start whether to 
send the mare or sit back and wait. 
</P>
<P>
The Anderson reined and trained New Zealander Admiral's Rule could not catch 
Doodlin last week after a relatively easy trip.

Sexual harassment ranges from simple annoyances such as leering, making sexual 
gestures, making or using derogatory or sexually degrading comments, to the 
more compromising unwanted sexual advances (either verbal or physical), 
compounded by offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors -- and 
threatening reprisals after such an advance is rejected. These forms of 
harassment are unlawful and referred to the district offices of the California 
Fair Employment and Housing Commission in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
After a complaint has been filed and the commission finds evidence that the law 
has been violated, efforts at conciliation are undertaken. If these efforts 
fail, the commission may file a formal accusation and hold a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission finds the law was violated, appropriate remedies may be 
ordered -- such as "monetary reimbursement, compensatory damages for pain and 
suffering, back pay, an offer of the position denied and affirmative relief," 
according to the commission's pamphlet. These compensatory damages for pain and 
suffering are currently being challenged by employers in California courts. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Orange County compared to the state of California during the last 
three fiscal years:

President's Day weekend is peak skiing time in the Western United States. 
Flights to such skiing meccas as Lake Tahoe, Jackson Hole, Powderhorn (via 
Grand Junction, Colo.) and Sun Valley (via Boise) require a change of planes. A 
direct flight to Denver gets a skier within reach of Aspen and Vail, a flight 
to Portland takes you to Mt. Hood or Timberline Lodge, Seattle is within reach 
of Crystal Mountain. The thrifty passenger can save, depending on the 
destination and whether the flight carries restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The following chart shows round-trip air fares to Albuquerque, Boise, Denver, 
Grand Junction, Jackson Hole, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, Portland (Ore.), Salt Lake 
City, San Francisco and Seattle from John Wayne Airport. Fares are for 
departure on Friday, Feb. 16, and returning Monday, Feb. 19. Las Vegas and San 
Francisco, while not necessarily skiing destinations, hold other allures. 
</P>
<P>
Two quotes are listed for each destination. The first quote is the lowest fare 
available, with various restrictions; the second is for unrestricted coach. See 
notes below.

In a report recently released by the environmental group Natural Resources 
Defense Council, 56 county firms were listed among the top 3,014 companies in 
the nation using three chemicals known to deplete the Earth's ozone layer. The 
companies were ranked on a weighted basis according to how much of each of the 
three chemicals -- methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and a 
chlorofluorocarbon known as CFC-113 -- they use. The report was based on 
federal government figures derived from the companies' own reports under the 
federal "right to know" law. Companies were required to begin reporting the 
information in 1987, and, in most instances, those are the most recent numbers 
available. Below is a list of how all the county companies ranked and the 
thousands of pounds of the chemicals in question for the years 1987 and, in 
some cases, 1988. The higher the ranking, the more dangerous the company's 
emissions, according to NRDC. There are no numbers available for carbon 
tetrachloride for either year.

AVA GARDNER, SULTRY FILM STAR, DIES AT 67 IN LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ava Gardner, the sharecropper's daughter whose specialty in films was the 
sloe-eyed sensuous beauty and whose husbands ranged from Mickey Rooney to Frank 
Sinatra, died Thursday at her home in London. 
</P>
<P>
She was 67 and died of pneumonia, a recurring illness she had been battling for 
several years. She also suffered a stroke in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Famed for her green eyes, reddish-brown hair, remarkably photogenic features 
and understated acting style, she became equally known for the men she 
attracted. They included orchestra leader Artie Shaw, whom she also married, to 
Spanish matadors whom she did not. 
</P>
<P>
Never considered a great actress in the classic sense of that word, she brought 
to her more than 60 pictures a magnetic quality that proved box-office 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
She spanned the generation of sex kittens and love goddesses between Rita 
Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe before settling in Europe in the 1960s and 
appearing only occasionally in TV shows and films after that. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in 1982, she said she would happily have traded her career for 
one happy, long-lasting marriage: "One good man I could love and marry and cook 
for and make a home for, who would stick around for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
"I never found him," she said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble was that I was a victim of image," she said. "Because I was 
promoted as a sort of siren and played all those sexy broads, people made the 
mistake of thinking I was like that off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't have been more wrong. Although no one believes it, I am 
pathologically shy. I was a country girl and I still have a country girl's 
rather simple, ordinary values." 
</P>
<P>
The country girl was indeed that, born Ava Lavinia Gardener near her family's 
farm in Smithfield, N.C., on Dec. 24, 1922, the youngest of five children. Her 
father lost his farm when she was only 2 and was forced to grow tobacco and 
cotton for shares of those crops. 
</P>
<P>
After her father's death in 1938, her mother ran a boarding house for minimal 
money and the young Ava remembered later the taunts of her classmates when she 
was forced to attend high school in old clothes. 
</P>
<P>
An older brother paid her way to Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C., 
where she intended to become a stenographer. But on a visit to New York with 
her sister, her brother-in-law, a commercial photographer, took a number of 
portraits of her. One of them was sent to Metro Goldwyn Mayer, which ordered a 
screen test. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speech Drawback 
</P>
<P>
It was decided to make the test a silent one because of her pronounced Southern 
drawl. Despite the limited test, an MGM official supposedly said after viewing 
it: "She can't act; she didn't talk; she's sensational. Get her out here." 
</P>
<P>
She came to Hollywood under a $50-a-week contract and took diction and acting 
lessons while posing for the popular cheesecake shots of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Her first film was "We Were Dancing" in 1942, a stylish romantic comedy with 
Norma Shearer and Melvyn Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
But her reputation as a sex goddess was not fully launched until the 1946 film 
"The Killers," in which she co-starred with Burt Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said in a statement from his Los Angeles home: "She was a wonderful 
lady, wonderful lady. . . . She was a very simple lady. She used to come down 
to the beach with us and cook and play with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope she was happy, that's all," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Gardner played a wild Spanish dancer opposite Humphrey Bogart in "The 
Barefoot Contessa" in 1954 and a love-hungry hotel proprietress chasing Richard 
Burton in Tennessee Williams' "Night of the Iguana" 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
On the set she was known as a nervous actress, who constantly chewed mints or 
gum but who never seemed in awe of such directors as John Huston, George Cukor 
and John Ford. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-career she had overcome the shallow roles that fell to her as a girl 
with appearances in such notable pictures as "Show Boat," "The Snows of 
Kilimanjaro," "Mogambo" (her only Oscar nomination) and "On the Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Her first marriage came in 1942 to fellow MGM stablemate Rooney. He was 21 and 
at one of several career peaks as the star of the Andy Hardy movies. She was 
19. There were reports that Rooney -- under orders -- took a studio press agent 
along on their honeymoon. They were divorced after 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
("My heart is broken with the loss of my first love," Rooney said from Florida. 
"The beauty and magic of Ava will forever be in all of our hearts.") 
</P>
<P>
She met bandleader Shaw at a Hollywood nightclub, and they were married in 
October, 1945. Shaw took several books to read on their honeymoon and 
columnists thereafter dwelt on his frustrations in trying to make her more 
literary. Miss Gardner later suffered a nervous breakdown, and the marriage 
ended a year after it began. 
</P>
<P>
Between Shaw and Sinatra, her name was linked to billionaire Howard Hughes, at 
whom she once supposedly launched an ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
She met Sinatra, whose career was in a slump, at a January, 1950, Palm Springs 
party. Sinatra was married at the time to his childhood sweetheart and wife of 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sinatra and Miss Gardner were married in Philadelphia on Nov. 2, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
She obtained a divorce from Sinatra in July, 1957, just as she finished making 
"The Sun Also Rises," in which she played the fiery Lady Brett, a seducer of 
bullfighters. 
</P>
<P>
But she and the singer remained friendly, she said a few years ago, adding that 
she considered Sinatra "a great artist." 
</P>
<P>
"Ava was a great lady, and her loss is very painful," Sinatra told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
She never remarried and in 1958 announced she was quitting MGM. 
</P>
<P>
"MGM was never the right studio for me," said the outspoken and lightly profane 
star. "They never bought a property for me; they never knew what to do with me. 
Most of the time, they loaned me out (to other studios)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overseas Work 
</P>
<P>
After that, much of her work was done outside the United States and at a tax 
advantage. She had an elegant apartment near Hyde Park in London and earlier a 
villa in Madrid. There she was a frequent visitor to the bullrings where she 
was linked romantically with a succession of toreros, including Mario Cabre and 
Luis Miguel Dominguin, once rated the No. 1 sword in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never really an actress," she said in 1985 in an interview granted in 
connection with appearances on the CBS-TV series "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
"None of us kids (including Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Van Johnson and Rooney) 
that came from MGM were. We were just good to look at." 
</P>
<P>
A private person even in her youth, she went to extremes to avoid photographers 
in her later years as she added a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But she also maintained a sense of humor about herself, telling a Los Angeles 
Times interviewer in 1985 that "I look like hell among those babies" (the 
"Knots Landing" cast.) 
</P>
<P>
There were dozens of articles and at least one book written about her and she 
once threatened to write one of her own, saying that her words had been twisted 
throughout her life.
