NEWSMAKERS: '80S DRUG SCENE TURNS 54 INTO AN UNLUCKY NUMBER

Studio 54, once Manhattan's trendiest nightspot among celebrities and 
glitterati, was ordered closed for two years because of rampant drug use and 
the sale of cocaine and other drugs inside the club. The club's cabaret license 
was yanked and its owner, Shalom Weiss, barred from reopening the disco for at 
least two years, according to New York Consumer Affairs Commissioner Angelo 
Aponte. In its heyday in the 1970s, Studio 54 was second home to arbitrators of 
hip such as Calvin Klein, Andy Warhol and Bianca Jagger. It fell out of the 
limelight in recent years, however, as new clubs became more popular among 
fickle New Yorkers. Consumer Affairs officials testified at administrative 
hearings that overt sale and use of illegal substances, such as crack, cocaine 
and marijuana, were commonplace inside the club and that club employees not 
only allowed drug activity, but in some cases participated in it or alerted 
patrons when police were coming.

 -- June Scobee, widow of Challenger space shuttle pilot Francis R. (Dick) 
Scobee, is engaged to marry an Army general in June. Mrs. Scobee, 46, will 
marry Lt. Gen. Don Rodgers, commander of the Global Army Information Systems 
Command at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz. The two met last Easter at a sunrise service at 
Arlington National Cemetery, where Mrs. Scobee had gone to visit the grave of 
her husband, who died with the six other crew members in the Jan. 28, 1986, 
shuttle explosion. Mrs. Scobee spearheaded efforts to create the Challenger 
Center for Space Science Education, dedicated to continuing the mission of the 
Challenger crew. Rodgers, 54, is a widower. Mrs. Scobee will be the first 
Challenger widow or widower to remarry.

 -- In an expedition intended to melt the "ice curtain," the United States and 
the Soviet Union have announced plans for a joint U.S.-Soviet dog sled and ski 
trek from Siberia to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Six Americans and six 
Soviets will depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two-month, 1,200-mile 
journey visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route. They 
will arrive at the Alaskan village of Kotzebue in late April. Sen. Frank H. 
Murkowski (R-Alaska) said of the Bering Bridge Expedition: "We are opening up 
the ice curtain that has divided us for so long. We're bringing together the 
Alaskan and Soviet Eskimo." The last surface crossing was in 1948, the 
expedition's sponsors said. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

MORNING BRIEFING: RIGGS' TOUGHEST HUSTLE WAS DOUBLY SCARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Riggs, king of the hustlers, was hard-pressed when asked to rate the best 
of his hustles, but he didn't hesitate when asked his toughest. 
</P>
<P>
"Evel Knievel bet me $25,000 I couldn't ride a motorcycle 600-some miles from 
Las Vegas to Twin Falls, Ida., where he was attempting to jump across Snake 
River Canyon," Riggs told the Milwaukee Journal. "I almost got killed on that 
thing. I didn't even know how the brakes worked. When it was over, my hands 
were frozen numb for a month. 
</P>
<P>
"But that wasn't the whole story. When I saw him jump, I said to myself, 'Oh, 
my God, he hasn't paid me my $25,000. What if he doesn't make it?' And he 
almost didn't. That was a bigger scare than my ride on the motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robert Reid of the Charlotte Hornets, when he first saw teammate Kurt 
Rambis in one of the team's designer uniforms: "It was like a construction 
worker putting on his tuxedo to go watch Pavarotti." 
</P>
<P>
Add Hornets: Said assistant coach Ed Badger, former coach at the University of 
Cincinnati, when asked the difference between college and pro coaching: "In 
college, when I called a timeout, at least I knew I was the highest-paid guy in 
the huddle." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Carl Yastrzemski's father, Carl Sr., still works 
daily at inside maintenance at MassPort, Boston Harbor. He's 72. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why he's in better shape than all of us," says Yaz. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Sr. was a promising infielder but had to say home during the Depression to 
work on the family farm in Long Island. The year before Yaz signed, he and his 
dad played together on a semipro club. Yaz hit .440. His dad hit .460. He was 
44. 
</P>
<P>
A reader had this to say about Art Modell in a letter to the Cleveland Plain 
Dealer: "It's hard to believe one man could fire Paul Brown, trade Paul 
Warfield, fire Sam Rutigliano and let Marty Schottenheimer get away all in one 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Time: Who did the Cleveland Browns get in return when they traded Paul 
Warfield? (Answer to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight, after the 71-70 upset of Michigan, 
which had feasted on a series of creampuffs in pre-conference games: "We had 
the snot knocked out of us early. We know what it means to lose big against 
good teams. But getting beat by a good team tells us what we need to do to beat 
those teams. That's really important." 
</P>
<P>
Said Patrik Sjoberg of Sweden when asked what he would be if not a world 
champion high jumper: "A full-time playboy." 
</P>
<P>
Or Do You Give a Hoot?: Anyone notice that when Jerry Berndt left Rice to 
become the head football coach at Temple he was going from one team of Owls to 
another? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Answer: Warfield was traded in 1970 to the Miami Dolphins for a No. 1 
draft choice, with which the Browns drafted Purdue quarterback Mike Phipps. The 
following year, the Dolphins made it to the first of three straight Super 
Bowls.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FLU BUG HAS PUT IRON CHICK'S STREAK OF 2,189 IN 
JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No need to panic quite yet, but one of sports' incredible streaks may be in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The flu that is sweeping Southern California, knocking people out of commission 
everywhere, has hit Chick Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' announcer hasn't missed a workday since 1965 -- a streak that has 
reached 2,189 games. 
</P>
<P>
Will he make it to Forum tonight to do the radio and Prime Ticket simulcast for 
the game between the Lakers and the Charlotte Hornets? 
</P>
<P>
This flu is brutal, but somehow, you figure, Hearn will be there. He has been 
sick before during the streak, one time even with pneumonia, and still refused 
to call in sick. 
</P>
<P>
Hearn has said, "Marge (his wife) props me up, we take the proper medication 
and somehow make it." 
</P>
<P>
Marge answered a call to the Hearn home Wednesday and said Chick was napping. 
</P>
<P>
"If he feels like talking, I'll have him call," Marge promised. 
</P>
<P>
Chick, who always feels like talking, did not call back later Wednesday or all 
day Thursday. Not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
But Marge told Laker publicist Josh Rosenfeld Thursday that Chick was able to 
sit up and eat some chicken soup and that she expected him to be at tonight's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently will take a lot more than a bout with the flu to sideline Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
He started feeling ill Tuesday, and he mentioned it during the pregame show 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
But during the Lakers' game against the New York Knicks, Hearn was his usual 
entertaining, fast-talking self, a style that recently earned him an Ace Award, 
cable television's version of an Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
Add Hearn: It wasn't sickness that caused Hearn to miss two Laker assignments 
in 1965, the only two he's missed in his 29 seasons with the team. 
</P>
<P>
He missed one game when he worked the Bob Hope Desert Classic for NBC. Then a 
few weeks later -- in late November -- he missed another because of a snowstorm 
in Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Hearn had just worked an USC-Arkansas football game. The pilot of his small 
charter said, "We shouldn't fly in this weather." 
</P>
<P>
Hearn told the pilot: "That's good enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Marotta has been fired by Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Marotta, the host of the talk show, "It's Your Call," the host of the King 
pregame shows, and the cable network's USC football and boxing announcer, got 
the word earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Marotta also works for radio station KRLA and is the Raiders' radio 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the firing was the result of an interview Marotta did with 
astrologer Joyce Jillson early last week. Jillson was on "It's Your Call" at 
the request of Prime Ticket President John Severino, and apparently Severino 
did not like the interview. 
</P>
<P>
But was it so bad that it justifies firing a solid, all-around announcer? 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't comment until I've talked directly with Severino to find out 
what I did," Marotta said. "It wasn't one of our better shows, but no way did I 
have any kind of argument, disagreement or flare-up with Joyce Jillson." 
</P>
<P>
Severino declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Furillo has replaced Marotta on "It's Your Call." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey is now popular in Los Angeles, but, except for the Kings' game on Prime 
Ticket, Los Angeles viewers have been getting shut out. 
</P>
<P>
That's because SportsChannel, the carrier of the national package, has no 
outlet here. But that is about to change. 
</P>
<P>
Although details have yet to be worked out, SportsChannel figures to own Z 
Channel before the National Hockey League playoffs begin April 3. 
</P>
<P>
Z Channel is already scheduled to carry SportsChannel's coverage of the 
All-Star game Feb. 7 at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel lawyers are currently re-negotiating Z Channel's contracts with 
the Dodgers, Angels and Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
The new deals probably will mean more exposures at a reduced rights fee. Z 
Channel's current management negotiated the deals with the assumption that 
commercials could be shown. But the courts later ruled that they couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers Thursday announced a 50-game Channel 11 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowl aftermath: The national Nielsen rating for the game was a 43.2 with 
a 68 share, which is a 4% increase over the 41.9 and 62 of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The postgame show earned a 32.5 and a 49, a 27% increase over last year's 25.5 
and 40. 
</P>
<P>
But the pregame show, which started an hour earlier this year, was down from a 
14 rating to a 13.4. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings for the pregame shows have been dropping steadly -- from a 21, to 
an 18, to a 14 and now a 13.4 -- but look for CBS to go with a 2-hour pregame 
show next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else can you get that kind of rating for something that has no rights 
fee," said Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
More Super Bowl: For high camp, it'll be hard to ever top the "Fred and Tommy 
Show," Channel 4's post postgame show with Fred Roggin and Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights was Lasorda telling Christie Brinkley, "Say hello to 
Joel." Brinkley is married to singer Billy Joel. 
</P>
<P>
To Lasorda, everything was outstanding. "It was an outstanding game." "Joe 
Montana was outstanding." And so on. 
</P>
<P>
According to KMPC's Jim Healy, Lasorda used the word 73 times. 
</P>
<P>
What was Healy's opinion of Lasorda's performance? What do you think was 
Healy's opinion of Lasorda's performance? 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda himself probably thought: "This job ain't that . . . easy." 
</P>
<P>
Kudos: The best recap of the Super Bowl was on "George Michael's Sports 
Machine" late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights from the entire week, including the rioting in Overtown -- something 
NBC chose to ignore in its coverage -- plus game highlights were edited into an 
excellent piece. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4's vacationing Brett Lewis -- he's been gone forever, it seems -- 
returns a week from today. . . . NBC is expected to announce soon that Ahmad 
Rashad has signed a new 4-year agreement. . . . The Eclipse Award for Horse of 
the Year will be announced at Santa Anita Saturday by John Forsythe and Tom 
Durkin and the announcement will be televised at halftime of the Nevada Las 
Vegas-Oklahoma college basketball game, which starts at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13 will again cover the Los Angeles Marathon. This year's race is 
scheduled March 5. . . . An interview ESPN's Chris Meyer did with Jerry Buss 
will appear on Sunday's 8 p.m. "SportsCenter" show. . . . Guaranteed to happen: 
CBS next year will knock NBC for its Talent Challenge, saying its pregame show 
will include nothing such as that. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC is carrying a weekly Angel talk show Tuesdays from 6 to 7 p.m., with Joel 
Meyers as the regular host and Angel announcers Al Conin and Ken Brett doing 
guest spots. Once the exhibition season begins March 20, the show will run 
nightly. . . . Boxing on Z Channel next Tuesday night at 7 has heavyweights 
Donnie Coats and Mike (the Bounty) Hunter squaring off at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Golf on CBS this weekend is the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and next week it 
is the L.A. Open. . . . Roscoe Tanner, who helped the United States win the 
1983 Davis Cup championship, will join announcers Cliff Drysdale and Fred 
Stolle in the booth for ESPN's U.S.-Paraguay Davis Cup coverage next weekend. . 
. . Correction: It was reported here last week that a new version of the old 
"Sports Challenge" show will return to television in September, and some of the 
old shows would be shown. Actually, only the new shows, and re-runs of those, 
will be shown. Channel 4 will be the L.A. outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Roone Arledge always got a lot of credit for ABC's success in covering the 
Olympics, but there were plenty of behind-the-scenes people who contributed 
just as much, if not more. Marvin Bater, vice president of Olympic operations 
and an ABC employee for 34 years, was one of those. Bater, 61, has been forced 
to retire from the network because ABC is no longer in the Olympic business. 
Said Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president: "Marvin's contributions to ABC 
Sports during 3 1/2 decades has justifiably earned him the respect of his peers 
around the world." Bater says he plans to start his own consulting business.

MARYLOUISE OATES: NANCY REAGAN SLATED FOR Q AND A ON FAMILY TOPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marylouise Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Music Center's Blue Ribbon will prove its social potency when Nancy Reagan 
meets the 650 women members in a "family" question-and-answer program March 1. 
</P>
<P>
One Reagan friend, Marion Jorgensen, a founding member of Blue Ribbon, will 
chair the Q-and-A session in the Mark Taper Forum and the luncheon following in 
the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Ribbon president Joanne Kozberg had the news at Wednesday's "Bravo, Oscar" 
show of Oscar de la Renta fashions and luncheon -- which put a flashy runway 
down the center of the usually formal Founders' room and put the Blue Ribbon 
back in a strong social spotlight. With a family tradition of volunteer service 
behind her, Kozberg has a combination of arts work and political experience -- 
clearly seen in the more decisive, more high-powered events that are being 
scheduled for this, her first year in the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gastronomic Success 
</P>
<P>
She had asked Dorie Pinola and Joni Smith to chair the event, which brought 
more than 100 De la Renta creations from Neiman Marcus (N-M's John Martens was 
there with his Blue Ribbon member wife, Bridget), along with Jerry and Syd 
Shaw, who own the De la Renta fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
And, hurrah! After years of complaints about the food produced in-house at the 
Music Center, the gastronomic tide has turned and the salmon coulibiac (that 
means fish wrapped in a pastry) was pronounced just swell, with kudos to the 
party chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
Among the very fashionable crowd -- Jean Smith (who said it was the "prettiest 
fashion show" in a long time), former Blue Ribbon presidents Nancy Livingston 
and Keith Kieschnick, advertising exec Adrienne Hall, Roz Millstone, Judy 
Carlin, Carole Kaye and Gloria Holden (seated next to the runway in what looked 
like identical yellow outfits), Florence and Marion Malouf, Ruth March and her 
daughter Nancy Vreeland, Dona Kendall, Armani's Wanda McDaniel Ruddy, best 
friends Mimi Meltzer and Loraine Sloan (who, because of "lottery seating," for 
once did not share a table), Annette O'Malley, Barbro Taper, Peggy Parker, 
Raylene Meyer, Betty Ann Koen, Geri Brawerman, Kati Domyan, and, among the few 
who could wear the more revealing fashions, Mary Milner, Debbie Lanni and 
Debbie Tellefson. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a rush for tickets -- but Kozberg said that the fire marshal had 
closed down the seating at 260. Too bad, because everyone had a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
And only Blue Ribbon members, no guests, no hubbies, can attend the Nancy 
Reagan morning. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS, FRANK -- Frank Sinatra, that is, who Wednesday night was honored with 
the Will Rogers Award at the Beverly Hills Diamond Jubilee Gala. 
</P>
<P>
If you weren't invited, you can catch it on TV in February -- but pity poor 
George Schlatter, the show's producer, who probably is going to have to leave 
the best bits on the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this can be used on television," Don Rickles announced, well into his 
act. "Who cares? George Schlatter is looking for anything. Two minutes. Six 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Sinatra's buddies just had too good a time at the black-tie gala -- George 
Hamilton, who pulled up his tux legs and did his Julio Iglesias imitation, 
Sinatra crony Jilly Rizzo (who announced that he didn't usually "show up at all 
without a subpoena"), the always glamorous Angie Dickinson, comedian Tom 
Dreesen (who announced, "Frank Sinatra punched every man Will Rogers ever 
liked") and Sinatra himself (who turned a mix-up with cue cards into a very 
funny bit, including the line "Will Rogers never met Dan Rather." (The 
TelePrompTer had read Geraldo Rivera, but Sinatra did a switch.) 
</P>
<P>
There were Sinatra and Schlatter star buddies like Joan Collins, Lucille Ball, 
Paul and Ann Anka, Allan Carr, Lee Remick, Charlton Heston, Coastal 
Commissioner Mark Nathanson with Valerie Perrine, producer Gary Pudney with 
Joanne Carson, and Donna Mills with her very, very steady, Tony Coleman. There 
was only a smattering of Beverly Hills social types (like Ellen and Bernie 
Byrens, Henry and Sedge Plitt) and business types (Warren Ackerman, the 
Bistro's Kurt Niklas, the Grill's Bob Spivak, Theodore's Herb Fink, and Don and 
Arletta Tronstein). And, back from Washington, Jerry and Jane Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Fitzgerald sang and brought the entire place to its collective feet. 
</P>
<P>
As for glitches, the Bev Hills Hotel picked up the tab for the night but if the 
evening was supposed to be a public relations ploy, hurrah for the lobster 
appetizer but someone should have checked the veal with the coats. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a guest list was released that not only gave the names of the folks who 
showed up but included the VIP's who didn't make it, like former President 
Gerald and Betty Ford, Mayor Tom and Ethel Bradley, Terri Garr, Fred Hayman and 
Sen. Pete and Gayle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Showing up were former Ambassador Bill and Betty Wilson (he's an adviser to the 
hotel's owners, the Brunei Investment Co.) and their daughter, Marcia Hobbs, 
also an adviser to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairing it all were Jackie Rosenberg and Annabelle Heiferman. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, and also there was Vanity Fair's Caroline Cushing Graham, with Billy 
Hitchcock -- who, of course, is a close relative of Tommy Hitchcock, one of the 
dashing polo players who long ago gave the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge 
its pizazz and personality. 
</P>
<P>
PRISON PARTY -- That's right. It was the Grand Ballroom of the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire Tuesday night, but benefit co-chair Lynne Wasserman and the magic of 
the Disney studios had totally transformed it for the premiere of "Three 
Fugitives" benefiting the California Institute of the Arts. And, if CalArts is 
supposed to be unorthodox, unusual and unique, so was the party. 
</P>
<P>
Gone were the banquet tables, the formality, the standard hotel fare. There was 
a guy with a cart with Dove bars, long buffet tables with Mexican food and 
fruit and cheese, waiters in prison garb. There were Western bars. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a lot of political talk. That's because Disney exec Frank Wells 
and his wife, Luanne, were there (and, of course, there is the constant talk 
that Wells will be making his first run soon for a major office), as well as 
back-to-Harvard Law professor Susan Estrich (the former Dukakis campaign 
manager) with her husband, Disney exec Marty Kaplan. (She's commuting and 
spending every weekend in California.) Benefit co-chairmen Jeffrey and Marilyn 
Katzenberg were on hand, but absent were co-chairmen Michael and Jane Eisner 
and Michael and Judy Ovitz. Too bad. They missed a great party.

STUDENTS WIDEN PROTESTS, TAKE TEACHERS' SIDE

As demonstrations tied to a labor dispute spread across at least half a dozen 
more Los Angeles campuses Thursday, students made it clear that they support 
teachers' pay demands but are not buying assurances that they will be unharmed 
if teachers fail to file midyear grades with the district next week. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 students participated in peaceful protests at Birmingham and 
Grant high schools in the San Fernando Valley. Hundreds walked out at Dorsey 
High School in Southwest Los Angeles, while smaller numbers demonstrated at 
Jefferson High and Horace Mann Junior High in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Targeted 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 students from several schools also converged on the downtown 
administrative and political nerve center of the nation's second-largest school 
district, and there was widespread talk among students of additional 
demonstrations planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters still are a small percentage of the total district enrollment of 
nearly 600,000 students, but those involved are becoming increasingly savvy 
about their power to use the news media and hit the school system in the 
pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's demonstrations were the first in which students said they had 
avoided or would purposely avoid the homeroom period at the start of the day so 
the district would lose money. State aid is based on student attendance in 
homeroom classes, and the school system loses $15 a day for each student not 
present. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers have what we want," said protester Alicia Barton, a college-bound 
senior at Washington High School, referring to midyear grades the teachers are 
threatening to withhold from the district. "The school board has what the 
teachers want (money). And we have what the school board needs (student 
attendance at homeroom)." 
</P>
<P>
At a multiple-school demonstration at the district's downtown headquarters, one 
group of students arrived chanting, "No grades. No homeroom. No money." 
</P>
<P>
School district officials said they had no estimate of financial losses, if 
any, on Thursday. But they and teachers' union officials attempted to 
discourage the tactic, saying it would simply aggravate the contract fight by 
reducing funds available for reaching a settlement with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The protest at the district headquarters was peaceful, although school district 
police for a time blocked students' efforts to enter the main administrative 
building. The protesters eventually were allowed to file quietly into the 
board's meeting room, while their representatives went into a lengthy meeting 
with school board members and Supt. Leonard Britton to discuss the issues. The 
discussion, which resulted in no agreements, was broadcast into the board room 
and to students outside over a public address system. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, by taking matters into their own hands in the course of the 
last week, the students have succeeded in focusing more public attention on the 
labor dispute than all of the previous public relations efforts of the district 
or its teachers. Thus far, however, the protests do not appear to be doing much 
to resolve the underlying problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Unaffected 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both sides of the labor dispute insist that they want the 
walkouts to end and say the protests have not yet affected the closed-door 
negotiations that have been taking place intermittently for months. The 
teachers are seeking a one-year agreement with a 12% pay increase. The district 
is offering 5.6% the first year and a total of 17% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, as part of a boycott of certain duties, still plan to withhold fall 
semester grades from the district, although students will be able to obtain 
them directly from teachers. That issue, which sparked the first protests, is 
controversial because many students and district officials express concern that 
college-bound students will be placed at a disadvantage if official transcripts 
are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers insist that students will not be harmed and that they will ensure that 
grades, which will be issued on unofficial, union-prepared report cards, will 
be forwarded to college admissions officials. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no shortage of misunderstandings, misinformation and 
manipulation in the week-old rash of protests. The district, the teachers and 
different groups of students have interpreted events differently. 
</P>
<P>
District officials play up the grade withholding, saying teachers are placing 
the students unnecessarily at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers play up the supportive comments of the students, insisting all the 
while that they are not encouraging the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Students also are becoming media-wise and are dabbling in the art of putting 
their own interpretation, or "spin," on the unfolding events. At Birmingham 
High in Van Nuys, where several hundred students walked out Thursday morning, 
about 15 students wore name badges that said "Ask Me." Students said the badges 
were intended to alert the news media as to who could give the proper 
explanation for the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of students here are confused about the issue," said Kevin Rex, a 
senior. "We're sick of being used as pawns between the teachers and the board." 
</P>
<P>
At the district headquarters demonstration, one group of protesters was coached 
by pro-teacher students on how to respond to reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep your answers short," one student advised. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Auerbach, a Marshall High School junior who did some of the coaching, said 
it was needed because "a lot of kids know why they are here, but they don't 
know how to express it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Targeted by Students 
</P>
<P>
"Our conflict is with the board, not the teachers," said Chuen-Yen-Lau, another 
Marshall High student. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the miscommunication has been comical. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is teachers to get a raise!" someone called out Thursday as Los 
Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub met with students at the 
district's downtown headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Weintraub said understandingly. "I know you need your grades." 
</P>
<P>
"No!" shouted the students. "Teachers need a raise!" 
</P>
<P>
Several students bound for out-of-state colleges said Thursday that they needed 
their official transcripts in the next few weeks. LeRoy Gorman, a Dorsey High 
senior seeking admission to the University of Denver, said he was told by 
university officials that he needed official midyear transcripts by March. 
</P>
<P>
"They said what's going on in California is 'not our problem. . . . We need the 
transcripts,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gorman, Kemo Lee, student body president at Dorsey and an organizer of the 
protest there, said the students support the teachers, "but we feel we are 
being used as a bargaining tool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Main Problem 
</P>
<P>
Betty Gomez, one of about 40 students who walked out of classes at Jefferson, 
said: "The reason is simple. If we don't get our grades, we can't go to 
college. . . . It's our future at stake, not theirs. Just because we're 
students, they're not taking us seriously. But they should." 
</P>
<P>
Many students, echoing arguments that have been used by the teachers, have been 
highly critical of top-paid district officials. For example, several students 
Thursday criticized the district for paying Supt. Britton's bodyguard-driver 
more than $90,000 last year in salary and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said this week he was taking steps to reduce the amount of overtime his 
driver works. 
</P>
<P>
Many said teachers deserve more money and cited the $23,000 starting teacher 
salary in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"A bus driver makes more than they do," said Payton Johnson, a Dorsey senior 
who organized the protest there and said he hopes to be a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
However, many students participating in the protests do not seem to have an 
understanding of what is actually happening in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
One 15-year-old student at Horace Mann appeared to have little idea what issues 
were on the bargaining table. When told that the district had made a pay offer 
to the teachers, she replied, "They did?" 
</P>
<P>
Many parents are being indirectly drawn into the dispute as their children skip 
classes and organize protests. 
</P>
<P>
"They really took me by surprise," said Charles Sims, a parent of another 
student suspended at Horace Mann. "I don't think the problem (withholding 
grades) is that great (at the junior high) . . . I'm gonna have to do some 
research." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Baltin, a parent of a student at Birmingham, said: "The teachers 
deserve a raise, but the students shouldn't be used as pawns. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm very proud of the way they demonstrated today. They were peaceful and 
orderly, and they handled themselves very well."

HOUSE FOES CONCEDE PAY HIKE VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
GOP BLOC ACCUSES WRIGHT OF BARRING OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE 
</P>

<P>
Republicans admitted defeat Thursday in their uphill battle to stop a 50% pay 
raise for members of Congress, federal judges and top executive branch 
officials but vowed to try later this year to cancel the congressional part. 
</P>
<P>
A back-bench bloc of GOP opponents accused Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) of 
preventing a vote before the Feb. 8 deadline by scheduling only brief, pro 
forma sessions of the House during the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same chance that a high school team has against the San Francisco 
49ers," said Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), alluding to the Super Bowl victors. 
"We're down to the two-minute drill, but the defense is strong, and we can't 
budge the Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Ban on Honorariums 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) said, however, that GOP leaders in 
the House agreed with top Democrats to let the pay raise take effect without a 
vote and then follow it up "within days" with legislation to ban honorariums to 
members of Congress by special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to Coelho press aide David Dreyer, a bipartisan group of 
four House members is considering how to ban the practice of allowing lawmakers 
to convert unspent campaign funds to their personal use when they leave 
Congress. Current restrictions on such funds apply only to members who took 
office after 1980, and the new measure would be directed at those elected 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be tough and comprehensive legislation," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Senate is expected to vote against the pay raise proposed by a White 
House commission and endorsed by then-President Ronald Reagan, it will take 
effect at 12:01 a.m. Feb. 8 unless the House also turns it down. Under the 
system used in setting the raises, they can go into effect without an 
affirmative vote. 
</P>
<P>
"For some senators, it's a case of 'vote no but take the dough,' " complained 
Rep. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Force Showdown 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa) said, however, that he and others are determined to 
force a showdown in the House later this year on the increase, which boosts 
Congress members' salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"You can run, but you can't hide from this issue forever," Tauke said. "It's 
just devastating to try and deal with the deficit when members of Congress are 
the first ones at the public trough." 
</P>
<P>
Since Democrats control the scheduling of legislative business, he said, foes 
of the pay raise would have to work out a coordinated strategy to force a vote 
on legislation rolling back the increase, at least for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said he was disappointed that Reagan did not 
scale back the pay increase recommended last month by a special commission 
headed by Lloyd N. Cutler, a Washington attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"A 50% increase is way out of line," Nielson said, adding that only two people 
out of thousands who attended meetings in his district are in favor of the pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said he is concerned that congressional staff 
members and federal government workers also would demand large pay raises, 
touching off an "inflationary psychology" at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress, he said, spend too much time around people with big 
incomes. "They lose sight of people barely getting by on $40,000 or $20,000 a 
year. It would be a slap in the face to them to take the raise." 
</P>
<P>
An angry Rep. Joe Skeen (R-N.M.) declared that he was not going to accept the 
additional $45,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to give it to my favorite charity, the U.S. Treasury, and hope that 
they use it to reduce the deficit," he said. "We haven't earned it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their collective fury, the protesting Republicans said they are far 
outnumbered by their colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, who are 
silently going along with the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Only 42 members, including 15 Democrats, have signed a resolution of 
disapproval and even fewer joined in a letter to Wright demanding that he allow 
a vote on the pay increase, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical stance was taken by the new House Republican Whip Richard Cheney of 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"He has said that if it comes to the floor, he'll vote against it," an aide 
said of Cheney. The way it looked Thursday, however, he won't have to redeem 
that pledge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FEDERAL PAY RAISE 
</P>
<P>
Congress is now not expected to block pay hikes that become law on Feb. 8 as a 
result of recommendations by a White House commission. The key annual salaries:

BUSH WILL VISIT BEIJING AFTER HIROHITO RITES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, moving to reinforce U.S. ties with the Beijing government and 
offer support for economic reforms there, will visit China for two days after 
attending the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo next month, the White House 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 25-26 trip to China marks a return by Bush to the country where he 
served as U.S. envoy in 1974-75, and it will compete with an expected visit to 
China later this year by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush will depart for Beijing 
after the Hirohito funeral on Feb. 24. While Fitzwater would not confirm any 
additional stops on Bush's itinerary, other officials have said that a stop in 
South Korea appears likely after the China visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Final Parameters' 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say for certain, but clearly this is not the final parameters for the 
trip," Fitzwater said when questioned about additional stops. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing other potential meetings, Fitzwater ruled out a meeting between 
PLO representatives and either Bush or Secretary of State James A. Baker III as 
"premature" pending an examination of the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
recent commitment to renounce terrorism. And, he said, talks have begun to set 
up a meeting between Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not publicly comment on his plans Thursday as he spent much of the day 
in private staff meetings. In his only public event, the President traveled a 
few blocks to Constitution Hall near the White House to laud 3,700 assembled 
government executives, calling government service "a noble calling and a public 
trust." 
</P>
<P>
According to Administration officials, Bush's personal ties to China spurred 
the upcoming visit and the decision was made only after much discussion within 
diplomatic circles over whether the addition of more stops after the funeral of 
Hirohito, who died Jan. 7, would upset the Japanese. During his vice 
presidency, Bush visited China twice, most recently in October, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He personally decided he wants to make this trip," a State Department official 
said before the China visit was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that geography also played a role in determining the agenda: 
"This makes sense in that while he has gone that far in that part of the world, 
that he also stop in and pay a visit to China," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the timing of any additional travel plans and the schedule of meetings to 
be undertaken during the trip remain fluid and under discussion, Fitzwater 
added. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have expressed interest in expanding the trip to include talks 
between representatives of nations attending the funeral, but the presidential 
spokesman said that it has not been determined whether such talks are possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously when a President goes to these events there are opportunities for 
bilateral meetings and obviously there are a lot of countries that would like 
to have them," he said. "But we have to consider the time constraints involved 
in moving around, in this case moving on to China, (and) protocol restraints 
associated with the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to any such talks, U.S. officials are expected to be interested in 
encouraging Chinese movement toward more open economic markets. Fitzwater, 
without elaboration, said Thursday that the United States intends through the 
visit to "offer support as they inch toward some openness in their society." 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Chinese relations have been beset in recent months by a tit-for-tat 
dispute over travel restrictions imposed on each nation's diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The new President's Far East trip -- which will be his second international 
visit, coming after a scheduled Feb. 10 visit to Canada -- will be sandwiched 
between two high-level Soviet sessions with the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for Gorbachev's visit, which will be the first by a Soviet 
leader to China in 20 years, but officials there expect the trip to come in mid 
to late spring. Firm dates will be established during a preliminary visit by 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, which China announced Thursday 
will be for three days beginning Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to renewing personal ties between the new President and Chinese 
leaders, Bush's trip will reinforce the importance of cooperation between the 
two nations shortly before Gorbachev arrives in Beijing to press for better 
relations between China and the Soviet Union, American officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater denied Thursday that the Bush Administration is sending a signal by 
approaching the Chinese for a visit while maintaining a steadfastly cautious 
approach to the Soviet Union. That approach was expressed most recently by Bush 
in a Wednesday interview in which he questioned the Soviet commitment to human 
rights and indicated that he would evaluate the Soviet performance before a 
scheduled 1991 human rights conference in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"No inferences" should be drawn from the different approaches to the two major 
Communist powers, Fitzwater said, telling reporters that Bush had reassured 
Gorbachev by telephone of his support for Soviet reforms in a "long and 
productive discussion" Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is he has gone out of his way to send the signal to both countries of 
our continued support and cooperation," Fitzwater said.

SAFETY THREAT SEEN;

COUNTERFEITS NOW NUTS, BOLTS ISSUE

<P>
Halfway through construction of its new headquarters in South Central Los 
Angeles, the U.S. Postal Service made a disturbing discovery. At least 20,000 
of the nuts and bolts in the building were counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
So officials ordered contractors to remove all of the substandard, foreign-made 
fasteners that were masquerading as high-quality, American-made parts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier earthquake beat them to it. 
</P>
<P>
During the 5.9 temblor, fasteners holding up five of the building's cement 
walls snapped. Nearly 100 tons of concrete crashed to the ground, shearing 
steel beams in the process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Have Been Killed' 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but had the quake occurred just a few hours later, 400 
construction workers would have been on the site. "People would have been out 
there," said Paul Kelly, the building's construction manager. "They would have 
been killed immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators say the Postal Service's experience with counterfeit 
parts is becoming alarmingly commonplace for both business and government. Over 
the last 18 months, counterfeit fasteners, ball bearings, valves and circuit 
breakers have surfaced throughout the nation, and notably where public safety 
is a vital concern: nuclear plants, commercial airliners, missiles, trucks, 
buildings, bridges, school buses and even the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad parts is a virus that has contaminated our industrial base," said Rep. Ron 
Wyden (D-Ore.), who will help lead congressional hearings on the issue expected 
to begin in February. "Everywhere we turn bad parts are showing up. I think 
this problem is far greater than anybody ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat to Safety 
</P>
<P>
Some of those familiar with parts counterfeiting fear a catastrophe in the 
fields of aviation or nuclear power. The U.S. House of Representatives' 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations recently concluded after a 
two-year study of counterfeit bolts, nuts and screws that "it is only a matter 
of time before a major tragedy strikes." Counterfeit parts, it added, "threaten 
the safety of every American." 
</P>
<P>
But many administrators in charge of public safety disagree and say a major 
accident caused by a counterfeit part is unlikely. "This is a very serious 
issue," said Victor Stello, executive director of operations at the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. "But the potential of a major nuclear accident happening 
is, at best, fairly small." 
</P>
<P>
Counterfeit parts come in two varieties -- cheap imports that bear markings or 
certificates indicating they were made in America and meet specified standards, 
and used parts that are refurbished or given a coat of paint and sold as new. 
</P>
<P>
Court records and investigators say counterfeiters obtain their inventory in 
two ways. They either import them or buy used product from scrap metal dealers 
and demolition companies. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the source, counterfeit parts often don't meet the standards that 
engineers require to ensure safety. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Boeing Co. discovered early last year that it had installed 
more than 2,000 allegedly counterfeit ball bearings in its 737, 747, 757 and 
767 commercial jets manufactured between April, 1986, and January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers for the Seattle aerospace giant tested a sample of the bearings and 
found defects that could cause them to break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fake Etchings 
</P>
<P>
Boeing thought it had bought a brand-name bearing manufactured by Torrington 
Co., a Connecticut-based ball bearings manufacturer. Etchings on the bearings, 
which were sold by Alliance Bearing Industries of Van Nuys, said they were made 
by a Torrington division. But in fact, the bearings were manufactured by IJK, a 
Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI raided Alliance in October as part of a criminal investigation And 
Torrington has sued Alliance in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, charging it 
with trademark counterfeiting and racketeering, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance has denied the charges but admitted the bearings were not 
Torrington's. The alleged counterfeiting was the work of one employee, 
according to Alliance's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration found after a three-month investigation 
that the ball bearings were used in non-safety related areas of Boeing's 
planes, such as the doors. But the same kind of bearing is used in several 
critical areas of an aircraft, including pilot control systems, which are used 
in changing altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA maintains that commercial airliners are fitted with emergency systems 
that would compensate for almost any kind of failure caused by a counterfeit 
part. "It is difficult to imagine a single counterfeit part would cause a crash 
except in the rarest of circumstances," FAA official Tony Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people have died in crashes involving private planes that officials 
determined were caused by defective fasteners -- the nuts, bolts and screws 
that hold together an aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board's 
computer database indicates there were 61 aviation accidents between 1984 and 
1987 caused by bad fasteners. How many of those fasteners were counterfeited is 
just now being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
And just last summer, three different military planes at Tinker Air Force Base 
in Oklahoma experienced engine failure as a result of defective bolts that may 
have been counterfeit, according to an internal Air Force safety alert. No one 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no catastrophic accident of any kind has ever been blamed on a 
counterfeit part. Some officials speculate that most counterfeit parts are so 
small that investigators might have missed their role in causing a larger 
component to break down with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has known what to look for until now," said Tommy Grant, a Houston 
parts supplier and the individual credited with bringing the counterfeit 
problem to the federal government's attention. "People call me nearly every day 
now with some new case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handful of Fatalities 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, only a handful of fatalities have been directly linked to the 
breakdown of counterfeit parts. 
</P>
<P>
Construction worker Calvin Davis was among them. Three days before Christmas in 
1987, Davis was kneeling on an iron beam getting ready to tighten bolts used to 
hold together the frame of a General Motors auto assembly plant then under 
construction in Springhill, Tenn. He was working 65 feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Using his body weight as leverage, Davis, 51, checked the first bolt. It broke, 
causing him to lose his balance. He fell to the ground and died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests proved the bolt was faulty. The supplier was Metal Building 
Bolts, a Houston parts distributor that is one of more than 30 companies 
currently under criminal investigation for allegedly selling counterfeit and 
substandard parts, according to congressional records. Metal Building Bolts has 
consistently denied any improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has only recently begun to take counterfeiters to court. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur O. Sammons of Canoga Park was one of the first targets. The National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration had bought thousands of nuts and bolts 
from his company, A. O. Sammons, in order to build its space laboratory, called 
Astro I. The lab was scheduled for launch aboard a space shuttle in March, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
But now Astro I is being taken apart because NASA learned Sammons had falsified 
documents saying the bolts passed certain safety tests. Tests indicated the 
bolts were defective and NASA says they could have posed a safety threat to 
astronauts. The lab, says NASA, could have literally started falling apart in 
the shuttle's cargo bay, setting loose large parts that could have damaged the 
shuttle. Astro I's disassembly took six months and cost NASA about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sammons, 77, pleaded guilty in November to 43 counts of fraud and making false 
statements to NASA and was ordered to get out of the aerospace fastener 
business in six months. 
</P>
<P>
A. O. Sammons is a one-man company that operates out of a condominium garage, 
according to federal investigators. Sammons has refused repeated interview 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has said allegedly counterfeit bolts sold by Lawrence Engineering &amp; 
Supply in Burbank were removed from the space shuttle Discovery just months 
before its successful mission last September. The Defense Department has 
alleged in an affidavit that the company was trying to pass off cheap Japanese 
bolts as more expensive U.S. parts. Lawrence's clerks told investigators from 
the Defense Department that they routinely filled in test results on 
certifications accompanying the bolts even though safety tests had not been 
performed, according to the Defense Department affidavit. One employee told 
officials he overheard a supervisor telling employees to "just fill in the 
blanks." Lawrence has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"There were thousands of bolts we had to check," said Wiley Bunn, director of 
quality assurance at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. "You 
can't believe what a mess this has been. The ultimate nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
How does a company like A. O. Sammons get such an important contract with NASA, 
a federal agency? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is the federal government and state governments often require that 
subcontracts be awarded to the lowest bidder. Because their product is either a 
used part or a cheap knockoff, counterfeiters usually can outbid legitimate 
parts suppliers. Sometimes, as in the case of Sammons, the government does not 
perform background checks on its suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hardly a Bargain 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority did business that way until 
recently, buying all of its nuts and bolts from the cheapest available source. 
But what the MTA was getting was hardly a bargain. After some of its 1,000 
buses kept breaking down in mid-1987, the agency tested its fastener inventory 
and was startled to learn that 92% was counterfeit. "The bolt distributors were 
supplying counterfeits and undercutting other companies to get the contracts, " 
said Bill Larson, an MTA test engineer. 
</P>
<P>
No one can say with any certainty how many companies are in the counterfeit 
parts trade, but numerous officials interviewed said a conservative guess would 
be several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Industrial Supply Center in Philadelphia, the military's warehouse 
of spare parts, found out last year that 30% of its inventory of bolts was 
bogus -- some 30 million bolts. But what really shocked defense officials was 
that the bolts had come from 50 different vendors. "This is fraud on a very 
wide scale," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
No other industry has been hit with a wider array of counterfeit parts than the 
nuclear industry. During the last year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has 
found numerous counterfeit fasteners, pipes, fuses, valves and circuit breakers 
in the nation's nuclear plants or sitting on shelves awaiting installation. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the fraud perpetrated on the nuclear industry is best 
illustrated by an internal NRC report written last summer that said at least 56 
companies were suspected of counterfeiting. The report was only addressing the 
counterfeiting of circuit breakers. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC, along with the U.S. Customs Service, has raided nine of the companies 
so far, all of them in the Los Angeles area. They were allegedly attaching 
labels from prominent companies such as Westinghouse to used circuit breakers 
and then selling them as new. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear plants -- like other businesses -- buy parts from distributors because 
either the original manufacturer has stopped making the necessary product or it 
can't fill the order right away. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC also has reported that more than half of the 110 nuclear plants in the 
United States currently operating contain counterfeit or substandard bolts, 
nuts and screws. Some of the parts are in safety-related systems. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups say the discoveries call into question the NRC's ability to 
guarantee the safe operation of nuclear plants as well as the quality of 
on-site parts inspections that utilities are required to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is definitely at risk," said Kenneth Boley, a nuclear safety 
analyst with Public Citizen in Washington, D.C. "The extent of counterfeit 
parts in nuclear plants is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Bogus circuit breakers and valves have set off the biggest alarms within the 
NRC because they make up a portion of a plant's safety system that cools 
reactor fuel with water during an emergency. In a worst-case scenario, a plant 
could release dangerous radiation if the parts don't work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nuclear Plant Affected 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the counterfeit problem was a case last April involving Pacific Gas 
&amp; Electric and its Diablo Canyon nuclear plant near San Luis Obispo. The 
Diablo Canyon facility notified the NRC that it had inadvertently installed 60 
counterfeit valves. The bad valves were discovered only after they had started 
leaking. 
</P>
<P>
Closer examinations showed the parts were old, refurbished valves stuck with 
labels and markings belonging to Henry Vogt Machine Co., a reputable 
Louisville, Ky., valve manufacturer. PG&amp;E, which said none of the bad 
valves were installed in Diablo Canyon's safety system, notes that they were 
marked with Vogt's name and appropriate parts numbers. "We expected our 
suppliers to be honest," spokesman George Sarkisian said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the NRC has only asked utilities to test a tiny sample of their parts 
inventory in an effort to determine the extent to which safety systems may have 
been compromised. Consumer groups have criticized the limited scope of the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The NRC and the nuclear industry are playing Russian roulette hoping a 
counterfeit or substandard part is not called upon in an emergency," Boley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But NRC officials deny the charge. "If a component didn't work, there are other 
systems that would," Stello said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the next few months, Rep. Wyden said, Congress and the appropriate 
federal agencies will design a strategy against counterfeiting. He and 50 other 
congressmen have introduced legislation that would hand out fines of up to 
$250,000 and prison terms of up to 10 years for selling counterfeit and bogus 
bolts to industries affecting public safety. More indictments of companies 
currently under investigation are expected, which officials hope will deter 
other counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a problem that is behind any of us or that we're finished with," 
Stello said. "We're not done. I'm not even sure we have found all there is to 
find."

LUJAN RULES OUT MINING, OIL DRILLING IN U.S. PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling for an end to years of controversy over environmental policy, Interior 
Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr. took a first step Thursday, affirming that 
the Bush Administration will not permit mining and oil drilling in national 
parks and wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared aimed at quelling a dispute sparked last month by the 
department's Office of Surface Mining, which had proposed a regulation that 
could open such areas to mining, drilling and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Drilling in Refuge 
</P>
<P>
But, in testimony before a Senate committee considering his nomination, Lujan 
showed no sign that the Administration might also pull back on the more 
contentious issue of oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
A broad coalition of environmental groups has urged the new Administration to 
abandon former Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel's request that Congress clear 
the way for oil and gas development in the region. Bush told reporters 
Wednesday that he favors "prudent development" of the region. 
</P>
<P>
After Lujan seconded the Bush stance Thursday, some Democratic senators 
indicated that the stage was set for further squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bush is going to run right into the meat grinder on this one," Sen. 
Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Line 'Already Drawn' 
</P>
<P>
"For better or for worse," George Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness 
Society, testified, "I think a line has already been drawn on that issue." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, whose nomination is expected to be easily confirmed, had expressed hope 
that his tenure as Interior secretary would not be marred by such disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"Discussions of natural resource issues have too often been marked by bitter 
controversy," he said. "We all need to lower our voice so that we can hear each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Heeding his own advice, the 60-year-old former New Mexico congressman testified 
tentatively, responding to some questions with mere nods of his head and 
providing only abbreviated answers to others. He confessed repeatedly that he 
did not yet know what positions the Bush Administration would take on specific 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warned of Being 'Patsy' 
</P>
<P>
That appeared to frustrate some senators, who urged Lujan to work within the 
Administration as an advocate for the environment. "We would hope that you 
would not be the patsy for the (Office of Management and Budget)," Sen. Mark 
Hatfield (R-Ore.) said. 
</P>
<P>
After assuring him that Bush had invited Cabinet members to volunteer their 
views, Lujan pledged: "I don't intend to be a shrinking violet." 
</P>
<P>
The goals and agenda that Lujan outlined in an opening statement Thursday gave 
special attention to the Interior Department's role in the war on drugs and in 
education of students in federal schools, but otherwise it contained little of 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Resource Use 
</P>
<P>
In tone it closely resembled the positions of his recent predecessors. "We are 
committed to protecting and enhancing the nation's valuable resources, as well 
as proceeding with their environmentally sound development," Lujan said of the 
new Administration. "We can do both; we do not have to choose between them." 
</P>
<P>
In later testimony, representatives of environmental groups criticized Lujan 
for his congressional voting history, which records a low level of support for 
environmental legislation. But they said that they envision no obstacle to his 
confirmation when his nomination is sent to the full Senate next week.

TOWER PAID $763,777 BY DEFENSE COMPANIES SINCE 1986 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of Defense nominee John G. Tower disclosed Thursday that he has 
received $763,777 in consulting and lobbying fees since 1986 from six defense 
contractors but said that he has severed all ties to the firms and that his 
decisions as defense secretary will not be swayed by past affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be people who will suspect anyone who has been formerly 
associated with the defense industry," Tower acknowledged at the second day of 
his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The former Texas senator promised to "bend over backwards" to avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict of interest, and he said that he would remove himself 
from decisions that could result in a former client's being suspended or barred 
from doing business with the federal government. But Tower said he would 
participate in other actions involving those firms. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that he would take no part in Pentagon decisions on an Air Force 
reconnaissance plane known as C-Fin, for computerized flight information 
system. He had lobbied for the $100-million program on behalf of the LTV 
Aerospace &amp; Defense Co., a subsidiary of Dallas-based LTV Corp., which paid 
him $246,860 for his services from June, 1986, to December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tower said he had resigned on Dec. 1 as a consultant to the six firms and 
insisted that he retains no financial interest in any of the companies. The 
defense contractors are LTV, Martin-Marietta Information Systems, Rockwell 
International Inc., Textron Inc. and the Washington consulting firms Hicks 
&amp; Associates and Jeford-McManus International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tower's financial disclosure forms, released Thursday, the former 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee earned $528,200 in 1988 in 
addition to his income from defense lobbying and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did Non-Defense Work 
</P>
<P>
The payments came from consulting contracts with non-defense firms, including 
British Aerospace Inc., which paid him $104,166, and Maxwell Communications, 
which paid him $153,334. In addition, he received tens of thousands of dollars 
in payments for serving on corporate boards, writing and lecturing. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified Thursday that he had served primarily as a "sounding board" for 
his defense industry clients on broad "political or strategic" issues, rather 
than obtaining information on specific contracts. He said he gleaned 
information from former colleagues in Congress, from officials of the Defense 
Department and from other lobbyists around Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he was aware of allegations of illegal traffic in sensitive 
military information arising from the federal "Ill Wind" investigation into 
corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying, but he declared that all of his 
activities were "within the bounds of law and ethics." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a general information-gathering process but never doing anything 
that was illicit or soliciting classified information or highly sensitive 
information from anybody in government," Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that the Ill Wind investigation has uncovered a 
"substantial problem" with illicit traffic in sensitive Pentagon data that must 
be addressed "swiftly and decisively." 
</P>
<P>
The federal inquiry already has yielded several indictments and guilty pleas 
from companies and consultants involved in defense contracting, and the 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, in a letter to the committee, said that the Justice 
Department had found no evidence that Tower was implicated in the procurement 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which 
is considering the Tower appointment, said he is troubled not by the fact that 
Tower had served as a defense consultant but by the number of firms for which 
he had worked. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that, if Tower were to remove himself from decisions involving all 
of his former clients, he could not function as secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tower replied that the law requires him only to sever all ties to the firms and 
told the panel: "I will have to stand primarily on my reputation as an honest 
public servant." 
</P>
<P>
Tower said he would support stronger "revolving door" legislation barring 
public officials from going into highly paid industry jobs immediately after 
leaving government; and he indicated support for a bill to require consultants 
doing business with federal agencies to register and list all of their clients.

RENTAL OUTLAY CUTS INTO BUDGET FOR U.S. DRUG ENFORCERS; 
</P>
<P>
$4 MILLION BEING SPENT ON EMPTY OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration, despite mounting budget pressures, is 
paying $324,000 a month in rent for a 12-story headquarters building and seven 
floors of a twin structure that it will not occupy for at least three more 
months, The Times learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the DEA starts moving into the facility in April, it will have paid 
$4.2 million in rent for the space, which was secured a year ago to permit the 
agency to consolidate its operations. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials acknowledge that the additional cost is contributing to cutbacks 
in its operations budget for such things as agent travel and equipment 
purchases but insist that it is having no impact on investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The budget pressure on drug enforcers has become so intense that President Bush 
said in a published interview Thursday that the all-out war on drugs he 
promised in his inaugural address would be mainly an educational rather than a 
law enforcement effort. He said in the interview that the "overriding problem 
of the deficit" would make it difficult to increase spending on enforcement to 
keep drugs out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Top DEA officials contend that paying rent for a year on an unoccupied building 
is "not phenomenal" and "not exclusive to the DEA" and that renting the 
structures early was necessary to pin down the space. 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that the office-space "market was a lot tighter" when the lease 
was negotiated and signed last year, an official of the General Services 
Administration, the agency that manages real estate for the federal government, 
said it is far from ordinary for a building to remain vacant that long. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we pay for unoccupied vacant space is the rare, rare exception," said 
Paul Chistolini, assistant regional administrator for real estate and 
development in GSA's national capital region. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the GSA has wanted to accelerate "the building-out," or final 
touches on the structures so the drug agency could speed up its move to cut the 
time the buildings stand vacant. 
</P>
<P>
But Donald P. Quinn, DEA's assistant administrator for operations support, said 
that even if the agency had done so, it still would have had to pay rent 
through November on its downtown Washington headquarters. That could have been 
avoided only if the GSA had found another government tenant for the space. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is "something over which DEA has no control," Quinn said, citing 
"one horror story" where a government-leased building stood vacant for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Chistolini said there was a 1984 incident in which a government-leased building 
in Hyattsville, Md., remained empty for up to three years because a tenant 
moved out and GSA was unable to find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials do not dispute that the multimillion-dollar expenditure is 
pinching the agency's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you have to absorb within the budget," Quinn said, citing 
cutbacks in headquarters expenses and travel, the deferral of equipment 
purchases and tighter procedures for using rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some West Coast DEA agents, insisting on anonymity, said that cutbacks 
instituted last October have limited money for informants, training of local 
police and purchases of evidence-related material. 
</P>
<P>
However, Quinn and Thomas C. Kelly, DEA's deputy administrator, maintained that 
the office space outlay -- equal to less than 1% of DEA's fiscal 1989

HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS REPORTED KILLED IN SOVIET, AFGHAN ATTACKS ALONG VITAL

Soviet and Afghan forces have killed hundreds of civilians in air and artillery 
attacks this week in a bid to force Muslim rebels to end their blockade of the 
main highway into the Afghan capital of Kabul, a Western diplomat said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat quoted witnesses as saying Soviet tanks rolled over the corpses of 
some of the civilians killed on the Salang Highway, the main route linking the 
Soviet Union with Kabul, where a rebel siege and a harsh winter have caused 
severe food and fuel shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The envoy said he received the reports of the attacks from three sources, 
including a diplomat "who is an outspoken defender" of the Soviet-backed Afghan 
government of President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet and Afghan forces Monday bombed areas north and south of the Salang 
Tunnel from the air, then opened artillery barrages that "obliterated all 
dwellings and villages" south of the strategic tunnel, killing hundreds of 
civilians, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks were apparently a "reprisal on the civilian population as a means 
to intimidate" rebel commander Ahmed Shah Masood, whose forces have been 
attacking supply convoys on the Salang road, the envoy said. Afghanistan said 
Tuesday that government forces killed 372 rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union last week launched a huge resupply operation to relieve the 
desperate shortages of essential goods in Kabul, but the diplomat reported long 
lines for fuel in the city Thursday, indicating that traffic is still not 
moving freely on the Salang road. Some food has been flown into Kabul from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has said it will complete a nine-month withdrawal of its 
troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, leaving Kabul vulnerable to seizure by the 
Islamic rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout is taking place under U.N.-mediated accords signed in Geneva by 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which harbors the guerrillas and funnels to them arms 
supplied by the United States, China and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel sources Thursday reported that a heavy air bombardment against 
guerrilla-held areas in the north of the country had taken a heavy toll of 
guerrillas and civilians in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning to Rebels 
</P>
<P>
One source said the attacks "come in the wake of the regime's warning to the 
moujahedeen (guerrillas) not to create problems for its convoys on the Salang. 
The moujahedeen did not heed the threats." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the seven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan said the 
resistance has sent 40 trucks of food to civilians in the besieged 
government-held eastern city of Jalalabad in response to severe shortages there 
and that arrangements were being made to supply other cities, including Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has held talks with rebel leaders in an attempt to reach an agreement on 
a political framework for Afghanistan that would avoid continued civil war in 
the country after the Soviet withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest meeting this month ended in deadlock over Soviet insistence on a 
role for members of Najibullah's party in any future government. Rebels leaders 
later rejected any further talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December, 1979, to support the Marxist 
government against an Islamic insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said Tuesday that the embattled Afghan government might shift 
some of its functions from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharif, a town close to the Soviet 
border, if U.S.-backed rebels appeared set to take the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The envoys noted that some foreign embassies have been evacuating non-essential 
personnel from Kabul amid fears the rebels will mount an offensive after the 
completion of the Soviet withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Embassy suspended its operation in Kabul last week. The British 
and U.S. missions advised their citizens in the capital to leave immediately, 
saying their safety could no longer be assured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of civilians were reported killed by Soviet and Afghan attacks near 
the strategic Salang Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. will close embassy as Soviet forces leave and guerrillas press in on 
Kabul.

NATO CHIEF URGES 'ROUGH PARITY' WITH EAST'S CONVENTIONAL FORCES 
</P>

<P>
The military man entrusted with the defense of Western Europe said Thursday 
that the Western allies should aim for "rough parity" with the Warsaw Pact 
forces in new conventional arms talks in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. John R. Galvin, supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization forces, said in an interview at his headquarters here that the 
West should aim for righting the current imbalance in military forces. Only 
then, he said, should NATO consider cutting its own military strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I think rough parity is a good goal," said the silver-haired, four-star U.S. 
officer, 59. 
</P>
<P>
After years of futile negotiations, NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations are 
scheduled to begin a new round of talks on reducing conventional arms in Europe 
early in March. 
</P>
<P>
The knottiest problem facing Western negotiators is the disparity between the 
size of opposing forces. The Warsaw Pact is generally held to have up to a 3-1 
advantage in heavy offensive weapons such as tanks and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
Few diplomatic observers believe the Soviets will accept outright parity. But 
NATO planners say they think that the most serious Warsaw Pact threat could be 
blunted by reducing the offensive capability of East Bloc forces, particularly 
for a quick attack. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to banning large formations of armored regiments near the border, 
which could be marshaled for a surprise attack, Galvin suggested that 
ammunition supplies be moved away from the front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting to See 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, he is still waiting to see the reductions in the Warsaw 
Pact forces that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised in a speech to 
the U.N. General Assembly in December. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a spokesman at NATO headquarters in Brussels rejected a Soviet 
challenge to match the unilateral cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional forces is general knowledge, and in 
view of this to reciprocate to statements of intent is unrealistic," the 
spokesman said in response to comments by Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former Soviet 
armed forces chief of staff. Akhromeyev was quoted Wednesday as saying the 
Warsaw Pact would not disarm unilaterally while NATO looked on "without taking 
adequate measures themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Galvin defended NATO policy-makers against claims that they have only belatedly 
reacted to initiatives by the Soviets on arms reduction. Holding a 3-1 
advantage in various weapons, "it is easy to seem conciliatory," he said of the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet overtures had come in reaction to Western strength, the general 
asserted, so officials of the Western allies have no basis for their propensity 
for "self-flagellation" and "wearing a hair shirt." 
</P>
<P>
In maintaining that strength, Galvin said the allies should modernize 
short-range nuclear forces, which basically means that a new U.S. missile will 
be needed to replace the Lance, a short-range missile now deployed in Europe 
that will be obsolete by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Delayed 
</P>
<P>
The West German government has delayed outright approval of such an upgrading, 
and some political advisers at NATO's headquarters in Brussels say the delay 
will make it more difficult for Chancellor Helmut Kohl eventually to support 
nuclear modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin said that a green light on nuclear modernization would allow him to cut 
back "significantly" the estimated 4,600 nuclear artillery shells in Europe, 
thus reducing German fears about nuclear stockpiles on their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin also expressed concern about West German hostility toward low-flying 
training flights and large-scale military maneuvers. He said he has asked his 
senior commanders to figure out ways that training exercises could be reduced 
without impairing military efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
As far as big maneuvers go, he said, "generals need training as well as 
privates and corporals." 
</P>
<P>
"We need less troops and more leaders in the field," he added with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin said that computer battlefield simulators help to give senior commanders 
experience through electronic means rather than tearing up the German 
countryside with tanks and troops. But maneuvers are needed, he said, so that 
military men may experience "what (strategist Karl von) Clausewitz called the 
friction of war." 
</P>
<P>
"We need Murphy," said the general, referring to "Murphy's Law" that asserts 
that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin welcomed the arms reduction proposals made by the Soviet Union but said 
he does not share the euphoria about them expressed in some Western political 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's leadership, said Galvin, is "taking a road that leads into an 
unknown situation."

ISRAEL MUST GIVE LAND FOR PEACE, SHULTZ WARNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his valedictory on the Middle East peace process, Secretary of State George 
P. Shultz renewed U.S. support for Israel's security but warned that there can 
be no peace unless Israel ends two decades of military occupation of the West 
Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Writing on his last full day in office, Shultz said that the new U.S. dialogue 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which he initiated last month, 
marks no change in the U.S. "commitment to Israel." But he made it clear that 
there are wide gaps between the American and Israeli approaches to a Middle 
East settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter to California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), Shultz 
provided a concise summary of current U.S. policy toward the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. It forms the starting point for the Bush Administration's 
consideration of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to Change 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, of course, can change 
the policy. But earlier administrations have been reluctant to make radical 
changes in previously stated positions on the Middle East because the region is 
so sensitive, both diplomatically and politically. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 1975, then Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger promised 
Israel that the United States would not have any dealings with the PLO until it 
recognized Israel's right to exist and met some other conditions. At the time, 
Kissinger apparently thought that he had outlined the functional equivalent of 
forever. But late last year, when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat accepted 
Kissinger's terms at a Geneva press conference, Shultz said that the United 
States was honor bound to begin substantive talks with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, a staunch supporter of Israel, said that he asked Shultz for the 
summary because he was concerned that the opening of the dialogue with the PLO 
had created "some unrealistic assumptions and expectations." 
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 19 letter, Shultz minimized the importance of the U.S.-PLO talks, 
reassuring Israel and its supporters in Congress that the dialogue did not 
erode Washington's longtime opposition to the creation of an independent 
Palestinian state. But he was unyielding in his assertion that Israel must 
withdraw from occupied territory, including the Golan Heights that Israel 
formally annexed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that having such a reaffirmation of policy from Shultz, who is the one 
who opened the dialogue (with the PLO), is a very useful message to all the 
parties in the region," Levine said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said that the PLO talks "represent no change in our assessment of what 
is required to bring about negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "There must be withdrawal by Israel from occupied territories, in 
a manner consistent with the necessities of security." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Division of Jerusalem 
</P>
<P>
He said that future negotiations must take place to determine the extent of the 
Israeli withdrawal from territories captured during the Arab-Israeli War in 
1967 and to fix new borders. He said that it is "out of the question" to expect 
Israel to return entirely to pre-1967 boundaries and that Jerusalem must not be 
divided again, as it was before 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way in which Palestinian rights can be realized and at the same time 
Israeli security ensured is through direct negotiations, launched -- if 
necessary -- through a properly structured international conference," Shultz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Washington wants "a comprehensive settlement" that would end 
all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict at the same time. That approach is 
generally endorsed by the Arab parties but has been rejected as unrealistic by 
Israel. The Israelis, asserting that it never will be possible to reach 
agreement with all of the Arabs simultaneously, prefer a step-by-step strategy 
of negotiating peace treaties with one Arab state at a time, the same technique 
that produced the Israel-Egypt treaty in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian political rights must be recognized and addressed," Shultz said. 
"The answer is not in an independent Palestinian state, which the United States 
does not support. The answer is not in Israeli annexation or continued control 
of the territories." 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said that Israel's right to exist in secure and recognized borders "is 
not negotiable." And he said that a continuation of the present level of 
animosity and distrust between Arabs and Israelis "is not tenable." 
</P>
<P>
He also warned the PLO -- which renounced terrorism as part of the deal that 
produced the dialogue with the United States -- that "terrorism must not only 
be renounced; it must be stopped -- period. . . . We continue to believe that 
performance counts and we will be watching PLO activities and statements 
carefully."

GILLESPIE ORDERS PUBLIC HEARING ON INSURER'S HIGHER CAR RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on Thursday ordered a public 
hearing for March 9 and 10 in San Francisco into State Farm's post-election 
practice of selling auto insurance policies to new customers at rates 20% 
higher than the company's old customers are charged. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, noting that State Farm is California's largest insurance seller and 
sets the pattern for many other firms, has called the practice a violation of 
the state's insurance code. But a formal hearing is required before she could 
order the company to stop what she calls "unfair discrimination in rating." 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner came under fire earlier in the week at a hearing 
called by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), chairman of the Senate's 
Insurance Committee, for failing to call the State Farm hearing more promptly. 
She had first declared the company out of compliance with the law in November. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said Thursday he is pleased that Gillespie has called the hearing, but 
still believes she should have moved faster. He noted that, by the time the 
hearing is held, State Farm will have sold thousands of new policies at the 
higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has said that it is taking time for the Insurance Department to 
develop its case for the hearing. On Thursday, she called the matter 
"particularly significant because of (State Farm's) position as a market 
leader."

BROAD GUN RESTRICTIONS PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
SEN. WATSON CALLS FOR REGISTRATION, 10% TAX ON PURCHASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran state Senate Democratic liberal rushed in with reams of proposals 
Thursday to crack down on firearms and gun ownership in California, including 
registration of all guns and imposition of a new 10% tax on firearm purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most recently announced legislation, the package advanced by Sen. Diane 
Watson (D-Los Angeles) goes beyond efforts merely to outlaw military 
assault-type semiautomatic weapons and additionally deals with civilian hunting 
and recreational arms. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's proposal posed a special problem for Senate leader David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), who will carry law enforcement's major gun-control bill of the 
session. Among other things, his measure would prohibit the manufacture and 
sale of military semi-automatics, such as the AK-47 that killed five children 
in Stockton last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Roberti bill faces a major uphill battle in what participants have forecast 
will be probably the toughest of the session, pitting the National Rifle Assn. 
and the Gun Owners of California against law enforcement and public safety 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Roberti said the Watson package of bills is likely to muddy 
the gun-control waters and contains the ingredients to energize opponents into 
lumping the various bills together in a massive lobbying campaign that could 
sink them all. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether fellow Democrat Watson's program might damage his own prospects 
for success, Roberti replied: "It has the potential of diverting attention. . . 
. We are all working on the same problem, but we are not necessarily endorsing 
each other's proposals." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the reelection conscious Legislature has been loathe to pass gun 
registration bills. For example, in 1968 the Assembly defeated a gun 
registration bill introduced after the assassination of U.S. Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. Subsequently, the bill's author, Assemblyman Winfield A. Shoemaker 
(D-Lompoc), was defeated for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti appeared briefly at a press conference Thursday when Watson announced 
her bills. He never directly addressed her program and left abruptly, telling 
reporters that "we are not signed off on each other's solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said he did not favor registration of sporting rifles and shotguns or 
adding a new tax on guns. However, he said that in addition to a prohibition on 
military semiautomatics, he now favors a 15-day waiting period between the time 
a purchaser buys any gun and when he or she takes possession of it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he had indicated that he favored a waiting period for semiautomatic 
rifles only as a fall-back position in case the prohibition legislation failed. 
A 15-day waiting period has long been required for handguns while the state 
background investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
"All weapons should have a 15-day waiting period," he said Thursday. Watson, 
whose district stretches from the edge of South-Central Los Angeles to the 
beach and includes Inglewood, Hawthorne and Lawndale, said burgeoning street 
gang and drug problems demand a serious response from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tightening controls over guns, she said, intensified efforts 
must be made to combat gang recruiting on school campuses and to create 
educational and job training programs for gang members and youngsters likely to 
join gangs. The proposed 10% gun tax would finance gang abatement and 
drug-trafficking programs. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked at the press conference by Democratic Sens. Ralph C. Dills of Gardena, 
Herschel Rosenthal of Los Angeles and Wadie P. Deddeh of Chula Vista, Watson 
said she would hold back on moving at least some of her bills so they would not 
interfere with Roberti's legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to rate the prospects for passage of the tax and registration measures, 
she replied: "I'm not naive enough to think we are going to be able to meet 
with tremendous success as we push the package of bills. But it is a beginning 
and it opens up the debate." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to outlaw military assault semiautomatic guns also has been 
proposed by Assemblymen Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Johan Klehs 
(D-San Leandro).

JUDGE UPSETS REAGAN ORDER ON CITIZENSHIP

In a ruling blocking citizenship for possibly hundreds of Filipinos serving in 
the U. S. Navy, a federal judge Thursday invalidated an executive order -- 
signed by President Reagan -- extending citizenship to foreign members of the 
military who participated in the 1983 U. S. invasion of Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam ruled in a case involving a Filipino 
sailor that Reagan overstepped his authority by imposing a geographical 
limitation in the directive. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam's ruling also means that an undetermined number of permanent resident 
aliens of any nationality who were in the military and were naturalized solely 
because of their participation in the Grenada invasion could be stripped of 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizenship Rules 
</P>
<P>
Except for Filipino sailors who enlist in the Navy in the Philippines, U. S. 
law allows permanent resident aliens who serve honorably in the armed forces 
for at least three years to be naturalized. Filipino nationals, 400 of whom are 
allowed under a little-known agreement between the U. S. and Filipino 
governments to enlist in the Navy each year without first obtaining permanent 
U. S. residency, can qualify for citizenship only if they serve on active duty 
during war. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many permanent resident aliens are affected by Gilliam's 
ruling. However, immigration experts noted that the Grenada invasion occurred 
more than five years ago, giving those aliens enough time to petition for 
citizenship under the provision that they served honorably for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gilliam's ruling has a direct affect on an unknown number of Filipino 
nationals who participated as sailors in the Grenada invasion. 
</P>
<P>
If Gilliam had struck down the geographical limitation in Reagan's order of 
Feb. 4, 1987, as requested by Arthur Reyes, a San Diego-based Navy enlisted man 
who sued the Immigration and Naturalization Service for citizenship, an 
estimated 1,700 Filipino sailors could have qualified for U. S. citizenship, 
according to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obscure Statute 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, an eight-year veteran, had sued on grounds that the "legislative 
history" of an obscure immigration statute prohibits the President from 
imposing a geographical limitation when he declares a period of hostilities. 
Reagan declared the time between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2, 1983 -- the time of the 
invasion -- to be a period of military hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam agreed with Reyes' argument, but he ruled that it was not Reagan's 
intent that every alien serving anywhere during the nine days of the invasion 
become eligible for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, a petty officer first class, is on sea duty and was unavailable for 
comment Thursday. His attorney, Robert Mautino, said he will probably appeal 
Gilliam's ruling. Attorneys for the INS could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-page ruling mailed to attorneys in the case, Gilliam wrote that "the 
order is struck down in its entirety" because it was illegal for Reagan to 
limit it only to those servicemen who participated in the Grenada invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, 30, and a law school graduate, sued the INS in June after the agency 
rejected his petition for citizenship. Reyes argued, and Gilliam agreed, that 
since World War I, and through all subsequent wars, Congress has refused to 
attach a geographical limitation to the immigration statute. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's order goes against the intent of Congress," Gilliam said in 
the written ruling. "As such, he is attempting to contravene the will of 
Congress." However, Gilliam noted that the statute gives the President the 
authority to designate a period of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Patron, a chief petty officer and nine-year Navy veteran, said that 
"everybody is frustrated by the judge's ruling. How can he undeclare a declared 
period? I don't understand it." Patron is president of the American Servicemen 
Citizenship Assn., a group of Filipino sailors organized to lobby for 
citizenship rights. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes was serving in San Diego at the time of the invasion, but argued that he 
deserved to be naturalized under the statute because the law had never included 
a geographical limitation. Gilliam agreed, and further noted that any U. S. 
serviceman could be sent to a war zone at any time. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Reyes referred to Navy corpsman Godofredo Romanillos Quirante, 
who enlisted in the Philippines and was among the more than 240 U. S. 
servicemen who died when Muslim terrorists bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut 
two days before the Grenada invasion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precedent Cited 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gilliam said that precedent allowed for immediate naturalization under 
the statute "regardless of where the person served" during a period of war. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilliam rejected Reyes' request to strike down only the geographical 
limitation included in Reagan's order. To do this would permit all aliens in 
the armed forces to become naturalized, regardless of where they were 
stationed, Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
To strike down the geographical limitation would cause Reagan's order to lose 
"its intended meaning," Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the President's intent that every alien serving anywhere during the 
nine days of the invasion become eligible for citizenship," he said.

50 ARE SLAIN IN SRI LANKA

About 50 people were killed in Sri Lanka in the worst single day of violence in 
the campaign for Feb. 15 parliamentary elections, police in the Asian island 
nation reported. Military sources said troops will help protect candidates. The 
dead included a candidate and five members of his family. Eight candidates and 
several of their supporters have been killed so far since the campaign began 
Jan. 10. In most of the killings, victims were dragged from their homes and 
shot. Police blamed the attacks on a left-wing, mainly Sinhalese, group based 
in the south. Rival political groups could also be responsible, analysts said.

Italian banker Roberto Calvi, found hanging under a bridge in London in 1982 
after his Banco Ambrosiano collapsed, did not commit suicide but was probably 
murdered, Italian judges have concluded. Calvi, dubbed "God's Banker" because 
of his close ties to the Vatican, disappeared a week before his death. At the 
time, he was awaiting the results of his appeal of a prison sentence for 
smuggling currency. The finding against suicide by a Milan civil court came as 
a result of an effort by Calvi's widow, Clara, to collect on a $3-million life 
insurance policy. A spokesman said the policy ruled out payment in case of 
suicide.

CHANGES IN MATH EDUCATION PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of leading mathematics organizations, warning that American students 
are dangerously unprepared in math, outlined an ambitious plan to revise math 
education that calls for less rote learning and a stronger emphasis on problem 
solving and fundamental concepts and more use of calculators and computers. The 
plan incorporates a number of ideas proposed by math educators in recent years, 
but it is the first coordinated effort to lay out a specific blueprint for 
implementing them. The organizations, working under the auspices of the 
National Research Council, said they would establish teaching standards for 
every grade, rewrite curricula and reconsider the current division of the 
subject into arithmetic, algebra, geometry and other distinct courses.

Rightist extremists threatened to kill the leaders of five Honduran civic 
groups in apparent reprisal for the slaying of retired Gen. Gustavo Alvarez 
Martinez, the anti-Communist former chief of Honduras' armed forces who was 
influential in organizing the Nicaraguan Contras on Honduran soil. The 
self-styled Anti-Communist Alliance of Action said in a broadcast statement 
that it has "judged" the five and "condemned" them to death. The threatened men 
include heads of political factions both in and out of government, a labor 
leader and two human rights leaders. The Popular Liberation 
Movement-Chinchonero, a leftist band that emerged in 1981, claimed 
responsibility for killing Alvarez.

The troubled Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pa., will use everything from 
less comfortable chairs to a new shift rotation to prevent a recurrence of 
control room operators sleeping on duty, officials said. About 60 reporters 
were handed hard hats, goggles and tiny radiation monitors as Philadelphia 
Electric Co., operator of the dormant plant on the Susquehanna River, conducted 
its first media tour of the facility. The utility is trying to convince the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission that things have changed since the NRC ordered 
the two Peach Bottom reactors shut down in March, 1987, because of widespread 
sleeping and horseplay on the job by control room workers. The problems 
resulted in a $1.25-million fine, largest in NRC history. Operator negligence 
was so pervasive that the commission also levied fines ranging from $500 to 
$1,000 against 33 current and former workers for "sleeping and-or inattention 
to duty."

PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will not request a U.S. visa in order to address an 
Arab-American group and will visit the United States only if he gets an 
official invitation from Washington, an aide announced in Cairo. Abdeen Jabara, 
president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said earlier this 
month that the group had invited Arafat to speak at its April meeting and he 
had accepted. But Nabil Shaath, a top political adviser to the Palestine 
Liberation Organization leader, announced that Arafat "will not go on an 
invitation from an unofficial group." Shaath did not explain why Arafat changed 
his mind.

A deepening arctic cold wave -- which has stopped the mail, prevented grocery 
deliveries and sent soldiers into retreat -- stopped oil field work, shut down 
a Hollywood crew and postponed one of Alaska's top sled dog races. "It's so 
cold up here the thermometer has run out of numbers," Willie (Bossman) Pitka, a 
Kuskokwim 300 Sled Dog Race official, said when the southwestern Alaska town of 
Kalskag hit 70 below zero. The 10th annual Kuskokwim 300, with a $50,000 purse, 
was supposed to start Thursday from Bethel. Extreme cold stopped the race 
before it could start, said Allen Auxier, race judge in Bethel.

Three members of a polygamist clan were sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 
years for the slaying of a law officer during a 13-day standoff at their Utah 
farm last year. The penalties will be served after they complete federal prison 
terms for taking part in the bombing of a Mormon chapel. State District Judge 
Michael Murphy in Salt Lake City sentenced clan leader Addam Swapp and his 
brother-in-law, John Timothy Singer, to one to 15 years for manslaughter and 
Swapp's brother, Jonathan, to a year in jail for negligent homicide. The 
sentences were pronounced two days before the anniversary of the shoot-out in 
Marion, Utah, that left state Corrections Lt. Fred House dead and Addam Swapp 
seriously wounded.

Former Ohio Rep. James V. Stanton dropped out of the contest for the 
chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee and endorsed the candidacy of 
front runner Ron Brown, a Washington attorney and former aide to the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. This leaves only one other rival to Brown for the party post, former 
Oklahoma Rep. James R. Jones. Brown virtually locked up the post when Michigan 
Democratic Party Chairman Richard Wiener withdrew and endorsed Brown. Brown and 
Wiener were regarded as the two leading contenders for the post, which will be 
filled by the national committee on Feb. 10. Paul G. Kirk Jr., party chairman 
since 1985, declined to seek another four-year term.

Once, San Pedro was a sleepy port town where goods and people arrived -- and 
promptly went elsewhere. In fact, the most exciting time of the day was when 
rival stagecoaches would pick up ship passengers and then race for the hotels 
of downtown Los Angeles, with riders on the rival lines betting heavily against 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 120 years later, Southern California is in the midst of a real estate 
boom, and San Pedro is very much a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that when Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores spoke to 
community leaders there Thursday, she got a little carried away and termed it a 
"State of the City" address. San Pedro is still just a part of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Flores issued a three-pronged plan for controlling growth in the community, 
reminding local leaders that "we . . . need to be sure that San Pedro remains 
the unique place it is." 
</P>
<P>
One part of the uniqueness that few seem to want to retain, however, is the 
town's one-time reputation as a favorite haunt of hard-living seamen. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' plan also calls for a ban on new liquor licenses along one of the main 
thoroughfares, Pacific Avenue.

 PLANS FOR MOSQUITO ABATEMENT ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors have taken the first step toward forming a 
mosquito abatement district throughout the San Gabriel Valley, thus making 
their second effort to get 25 valley cities or residents to pay the cost of 
eradicating the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The board, advised that a mosquito-borne encephalitis virus stills exists in 
the area, decided to file an application for formation of the district and to 
lobby San Gabriel Valley cities to join. Participation is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino and South El Monte, which already are members of a mosquito 
district, and Pasadena, which has its own eradication program, would not be 
asked to join, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district would be established after hearings by the Local Agency Formation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A similar county proposal stalled in 1987 after receiving little support from 
25 San Gabriel Valley cities. Only 27 cities in the entire county neither 
support an abatement district nor have their own programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities were reluctant to split the costs -- now about $325,000 annually -- 
because the money would have to come from general funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, a property tax of about $2 per parcel per year would pay 
for the abatement district, officials said.

Photo, A Devastating Scoop du Jour A $3-million job to tear down 41 Balboa 
Naval Hospital buildings spread across 47 acres started Thursday. The 
contractor, Diamond Pacific, expects the task to take a year. Instead of the 
traditional ball and crane, the company chose a Koehring 1466, one of the 
largest machines of its type, to do the bulk of the work. It cost $24,000 just 
to have the machine dismantled in Kansas City, brought here on six 
tractor-trailer rigs and reassembled. Construction began in 1920 on the 
hospital, which grew as demand warranted. In 1988, as part of a land swap with 
San Diego, the Navy unveiled a new hospital in Florida Canyon. DAVE GATLEY /

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLING IN VISTA TO BEGIN IN '90; 2ND BOND VOTE PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students in the Vista Unified School District will begin year-round schooling 
in the fall of 1990, and district residents in November will be asked again to 
approve a bond issue to help the district cope with crowding, the school board 
has decided. 
</P>
<P>
District voters last November rejected a $63-million bond issue, but school 
board members decided unanimously Wednesday night to go back to the voters a 
second time, this time for permission to issue $38.8 million in bonds to 
renovate aging schools and build new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The bond election last November received the blessing of 59.9% of the voters, 
but a two-thirds' majority is necessary for bond authorization. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are extremely desperate," Trustee Lance Vollmer said. "If the bond 
issue fails this time, the next thing we might be looking at is double sessions 
and year-round schools." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Round Plan 'A Given' 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the plan for year-round schools, which has been discussed for 
more than eight months, will be implemented even if the bond issue next 
November is approved. 
</P>
<P>
"Year-round schools are a given. There's no question. Our goal now is that it 
hamper as few people as possible. We want it to work as smoothly as possible," 
Vollmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Existing facilities in the Vista school district were designed to handle about 
10,000 students, but the district's enrollment is about 16,000 and growing. The 
overflow students are now accommodated in portable classrooms, but some schools 
can't even add temporary classrooms because other facilities -- including 
libraries, playgrounds, restrooms and cafeterias -- are stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
District controller Richard Vought said a specific spending plan for the $38.8 
million in bond revenue, should it materialize, has not yet been outlined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Money for New Kitchen 
</P>
<P>
But, when they campaigned for last November's $63-million bond issue, officials 
said $36.1 million was needed immediately for the renovation of some of the 
district's oldest schools and to build three elementary schools and a middle 
school. Those four schools, officials said, are needed to relieve crowding, 
even if the district's growth were to stop immediately. Some of the money would 
also be used for the construction of a central kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $26.9 million sought last year would have financed about half the 
cost of 10 more elementary schools, two middle schools and a high school that 
the district believes will be needed by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The year-round schooling will begin in phases. Starting in the fall of 1990, 
students in the district's 10 elementary schools will begin attending school 
all year on a schedule marked by several short vacations versus the longer, 
traditional summer break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schedules to Begin in 1991, 1992 
</P>
<P>
Students in the district's three middle schools will begin their year-round 
schedule in the fall of 1991, and students in the three high schools will begin 
the schedule in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of such plans say year-round schedules confound families trying to 
schedule vacations, especially if they have children in different grades in 
which the schedules do not coincide. Another concern is that year-round schools 
make it more difficult for children to participate in traditional summer 
enrichment programs and activities sponsored by community youth, art, athletic 
and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents note, however, that year-round schedules allow families to take 
vacations at times other than the traditional summer months, when most families 
travel, that the shorter breaks between sessions allow students to retain more 
and that less time is needed for refreshing.

A Vietnamese couple was robbed in their home in the 2600 block of Gerald Street 
Thursday afternoon, apparently by a team of Vietnamese robbers who were 
involved in a similar robbery last week, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims told police they were robbed by four Vietnamese gunmen, who tied 
them up and blindfolded them. The robbers, demanding gold, ransacked the house, 
destroyed furniture and took $400 to $500 in cash, police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, about 45 years old, told police that one robber held a knife to her 
throat, cutting her slightly. Her husband, about 55, was kicked. Both were 
treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the robbers are the same ones who barged into a house on Thorn 
Street last week, during which one of the robbers held up a baby and threatened 
to drop him, then kicked an elderly woman who tried to protect the baby. The 
people in that home were from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"They are brutal, brutal suspects," Robinson said.

Two suspects were arrested Wednesday night in connection with the Christmas Eve 
shooting death of a man in Stockton, Calif., after which the killers set the 
victim on fire in a 50-gallon oil drum filled with gasoline to dispose of the 
body, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Madsen, 33, and Michelle Stubblefield, 29, were arrested at 5 p.m. after 
detectives from the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Department and the San Diego 
Police Department served a search warrant at the hotel where they were staying 
at 13th and Market streets. The couple had been in San Diego about five days, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested in the death of Russell Wedge, 39. After Wedge was 
killed, police said he was wrapped in a blanket with ropes and carried a few 
days inside a car. The body was then stuffed head-first into a 50-gallon oil 
drum full of gas, placed inside a rented truck and set afire. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were scheduled to be transferred to Stockton Thursday night to 
face charges there, police said.

Three workers at a construction site at UC San Diego were injured Thursday when 
they were struck by a hose that was spewing cement, said Paul Lowenberg, public 
information officer at the university. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m., Pete Curto of La Mesa and John Yeakey, both 33, of Lakeside and 
Jaime Rocha, 37, of San Diego were working on the roof of the university's new 
molecular biology research building when workers lost control of a hose that 
was pumping cement. The hose continued to spray cement as it snaked 
uncontrollably, hitting the three men. 
</P>
<P>
The workers were taken to Scripps Hospital in La Jolla. Curto and Rocha were 
treated for back injuries, and Yeakey was treated for minor bruises, a hospital

STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS; 
</P>
<P>
FLORES MAPS NEW PLAN TO CONTROL GROWTH THROUGHOUT SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that "we again need to be sure that San Pedro remains the unique 
place it is," Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores on Thursday unveiled a 
three-pronged plan for controlling growth in the community, nearly a decade 
after a similar campaign was waged. 
</P>
<P>
In her annual State of the City address before community leaders, Flores 
announced that she will: 
</P>
<P>
Push ahead with an effort to revise the San Pedro Community Plan, which governs 
development through zoning. That plan, adopted in 1980, reduced San Pedro's 
potential density by 60%, according to Flores. Now, she said, "the same 
arguments (about overdevelopment) that led to that decision are being heard 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Initiate a new "downtown specific plan" for San Pedro's business district. 
Flores said recent construction downtown, including a new Sheraton hotel and 
office tower, show that downtown has different needs than the rest of San 
Pedro, which is largely residential. 
</P>
<P>
Introduce an interim control ordinance which, if adopted by the City Council, 
will "help offset the threats to existing commercial businesses" along Pacific 
Avenue, beginning Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and community leaders have been concerned that a recent rash of 
apartment development will hurt business along Pacific Avenue, once the 
community's main commercial thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
The interim control ordinance, a temporary measure, would require apartment 
developers to build farther back from the street. It would also ban new liquor 
licenses along the avenue, following the recommendation of a task force that 
Flores appointed last year to study Pacific Avenue's problems. 
</P>
<P>
As is her custom, Flores will appoint two citizens advisory committees to deal 
with planning issues: one to study the community plan, and another to study the 
plan for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that revisions are necessary for San Pedro's community plan is not a 
new one. The city Planning Department already has said it intends to bring 
community plans throughout Los Angeles up to date in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Rely on Citizens' Work 
</P>
<P>
But Flores maintained that her initiative is preferable because it will rely on 
the work of citizens, rather than city planners. She said she will appoint a 
citizens advisory committee to study the issue and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her lengthy comments on planning matters, Flores devoted a 
significant portion of her speech to environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
She said she intends to propose that a new city department -- the Department of 
the Environment -- be created. The new department, whose role and enforcement 
powers she did not define, would deal with environmental problems faced by 
other city agencies, as well as by residents and businesses. It would also act 
as a "clearinghouse" for information, Flores said. The department would be 
governed by an appointed commission, similar to the Board of Harbor 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Flores also pledged to continue pushing for laws at the city, state and federal 
levels that would require the Port of Los Angeles to offset environmental 
damage it causes by improving local habitats, rather than those outside the 
harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' speech, delivered before about 200 people at Nizetich's restaurant near 
Ports O'Call Village, appeared to be generally well-received by the crowd, 
mostly business and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Leron Gubler, executive director of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, 
cautioned against "a mad dash to downzone the community without thinking about 
any impact." Of the new advisory committees, Gubler said that he hopes "that a 
lot of thought is put into what they do." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the development fence, Shanaz Ardehali-Kordich, leader of 
the San Pedro Downzone Coalition, said the councilwoman's proposals did not go 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's aware that there's a problem and she's saying she's looking into 
it but she hasn't committed herself," said Ardehali-Kordich, whose coalition is 
pushing for a moratorium on apartment building on Pacific Avenue and for a 
rezoning that would permit only duplexes and single-family homes in residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of the proposed interim control ordinance for Pacific Avenue, Ardehali-Kordich 
said, "It's a first step, I guess, but there still needs to be more of a 
control than just a setback." 
</P>
<P>
In her talk, Flores said that when the San Pedro Community Plan was implemented 
in 1981, some people complained that its curbs on development would depress 
real estate values and discourage businesses from locating in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"But history shows us another picture," she said, citing "a new interest in 
commercial development" and real estate price increases of 20% to 25% last 
year.

DECISION ON INGLEWOOD PRINCIPAL AFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an emergency meeting marked by charges of political favoritism, Inglewood 
school board members voted once again Thursday to reverse a decision to dismiss 
Leonard Matthews, a politically connected former high school principal accused 
of embezzling school funds. 
</P>
<P>
Board members voted, 3-1, to approve Supt. George McKenna's recommendation to 
demote rather than fire Matthews, the former principal of Hillcrest High 
School, who officials say has agreed to pay the district $10,000 in restitution 
for funds he allegedly misused. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Zyra McCloud and several residents spoke out loudly against the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Gossett, a local businessman, said: "Probably nowhere else in the United 
States would a board of trustees consider putting a person in a classroom who 
apparently admits to misappropriating $10,000 in public funds. . . . It is 
completely out of balance that you would tolerate such behavior, much less 
reward it." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was not present. He and his lawyer, Carl Douglas, repeatedly have 
declined comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Outraged 
</P>
<P>
The vote was the second this week on the Matthews case, which has outraged some 
school employees and community members who say the board should fire Matthews. 
They say he is being protected because he has been active in the campaigns of 
board members Larry Aubry, Caroline Coleman, Lois Hill-Hale and Joseph Rouzan, 
a former Inglewood police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Aubry, Coleman and Rouzan voted Thursday to reverse Matthews' dismissal. 
McCloud voted no, and Hill-Hale did not attend the emergency 4:30 p.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna and the board members said politics had nothing to do with the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that Matthews -- who was transferred to a central administrative 
post after charges against him surfaced in late 1987 -- could again face 
dismissal if he is convicted of a felony. Inglewood police, who investigated 
the case for a year, have referred the results of their inquiry to the Los 
Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's regularly scheduled meeting, board members voted, 2 to 1, to 
rescind their decision in October to initiate dismissal procedures against 
Matthews. Instead, they demoted him from a $55,000 administrative post to a 
$42,000 teaching position. However, county attorneys deemed that action illegal 
because three votes are required for the five-member board to approve an 
action. That opinion forced Thursday's emergency meeting, when the board 
ratified its previous vote. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's vote, five residents, including Gossett and PTA Council 
President Norma Smith, criticized the board for being too lenient with 
Matthews. McKenna and the board members did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
Police affidavits say Matthews set up a bank account into which he 
systematically diverted at least $4,000 in Hillcrest funds from employees' 
paychecks, a school snack store and donations to Hillcrest from businesses 
during 1986 and 1987. Matthews allegedly used the school money for personal 
expenses including clothes, groceries and Christmas decorations for his front 
yard, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said Matthews was previously disciplined by the board in 1987 for 
using school district equipment to prepare political flyers for candidates.

BURBANK TO LOOK AT A LAW COVERING STATES OF UNDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank will never become the Naked City, if City Council members get their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to address undress in the city Tuesday when it 
considers an ordinance that would make it illegal to appear nude in public -- 
for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing city law, Burbank can only prohibit public nudity or disrobing 
that is sexual in nature. With people who walk nude down the street, sunbathe 
in parks or "streak," city police can do little more than ask them to put on 
proper attire. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Terry B. Stevenson said the ordinance was partially 
inspired by a streaker who ran naked down an alley late last year. Although 
police arrested the man, they were unable to file charges because he had not 
committed a crime, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He hadn't broken any law so the police had to let him go," Stevenson said. 
"Situations like this had happened at times in the past, so we wanted to get 
something on the lawbooks before it became a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, a colony of nudists could show up one day at McCambridge Park and 
there would not be anything we could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Police said four streakers were arrested last year. "These folks were not 
psycho or anything, and it was very frustrating for our officers when they saw 
someone walking nude down the street and they couldn't do anything," said Capt. 
James Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
However, police say there's no trend toward nudity in Burbank. "It's not like 
there's an epidemic," said Police Chief Glen Bell. 
</P>
<P>
State law prevents indecent exposure or lewd conduct with sexual intent, and a 
city ordinance requires waiters and waitresses to wear clothes while serving 
customers. These laws also regulate live nude shows of a sexual nature. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the council, the law would become effective March 10. The 
maximum penalty for the misdemeanor offense would be a $1,000 fine or six 
months in county jail -- clothed, of course.

911: NEW EMERGENCY SYSTEM READY TO GO IN HERMOSA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a series of failures, Hermosa Beach's 911 telephone equipment has been 
replaced and officials expect residents will experience no further problems 
when they dial the emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Public Safety Director Steve Wisniewski conceded that some 
fingers may be crossed at City Hall until the new system proves its 
reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that the problems have been fixed, but time will tell," he 
said Thursday. During outages in the system in recent weeks, he said, residents 
were able to report emergencies by dialing the Police or Fire departments when 
they could not get through on 911. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Problems 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski said he knows of no complaints nor problems caused by delays in 
reporting emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach began operating its own 911 number in late December, after 
dropping out of the South Bay Regional Public Authority, which had handled 
emergency calls from city residents. The city made the switch in hopes of 
reducing its costs for emergency dispatch services. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's own 911 system crashed for about four hours on Jan. 13, then 
again on Jan. 17, and for the last time, officials hope, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, General Telephone, which provided the equipment, attributed the 
failure to external circuit problems. In the others, internal devices in the 
911 equipment malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski said the phone company had installed used equipment initially but 
replaced it with a new system after the third failure on Wednesday. Hermosa 
Beach has its own back-up electrical power, a generator and batteries that 
automatically kick in whenever there is a failure in line power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Lack of Power' 
</P>
<P>
"Lack of power wasn't the problem," he said. "Power was still running into the 
911 box when the voltage converter or other devices inside the box failed." 
</P>
<P>
General Telephone officials said the company provides 911 systems for 90 police 
departments and rarely has technical failures. 
</P>
<P>
When Hermosa Beach decided in late 1987 to exclude itself from the regional 
communications center and return to a city-operated dispatch system, officials 
projected a savings of from $307,000 to $621,000 over a seven-year period, 
Wisniewski said. The amount of savings, he said, will depend on how much the 
center increases its charges to member cities between now and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Those costs, he said, have escalated sharply in recent years, rising from 
$82,458 in the fiscal year 1979-80 to a projected $264,891 this year, if the 
city had stayed in the regional network. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to acquiring its own 911 equipment, which costs about $25,000, the 
city hired five dispatchers, remodeled quarters for them and bought computer 
and radio equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state pays the monthly telephone charges for the 911 number, which leaves 
the city with annual costs of $145,000 for the dispatchers and $115,000 for the 
computer and radio equipment, Wisniewski said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's savings over what it would have cost if it had remained in 
the regional network would occur after Hermosa Beach pays off its equipment 
costs in five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Benson, executive director of the regional communications center, 
said that what Hermosa Beach paid toward the cost of operating the center will 
be divided among the remaining member cities: Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, 
Hawthorne and Gardena. He said he expects no substantial increase in the 
center's new budget. 
</P>
<P>
Benson said assessments for an equipment replacement fund accounted for the 
increases in fees to members in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing the participation of Hermosa Beach, Benson said, "The prospects 
for the center are very bright. We provide a level of services and efficiency 
that cannot be duplicated by individual cities." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a single dispatcher in a police department may be 
overwhelmed by calls in a major emergency, while the center has enough staff to 
handle emergencies along with calls from other member cities. High-speed chases 
through several cities also can be better coordinated at the center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The regional center began operations in 1975 with seven member cities. Palos 
Verdes Estates dropped out in 1981 and Redondo Beach left the network two years 
later.

<P>
A developer fighting residents' opposition to his $150-million office project 
has appealed for help from Woodland Hills business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Builder Jack Spound urged members of the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce to 
pack a public hearing on Feb. 6 when his proposed nine-building "Warner Ridge" 
project is considered by Los Angeles city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said that a major show of support for offices on his 22-acre parcel on a 
hill between Warner Center and a 1,300-house neighborhood will help him beat 
back Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus' opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Picus has sided with homeowners in the dispute. She is seeking a zoning 
rollback that will allow only luxury homes on the site at the northeast corner 
of De Soto Avenue and Oxnard Street.

<P>
But Spound said that the 850-member Chamber of Commerce can help sway a hearing 
officer, whose findings will later be considered by the city Planning 
Commission. The hearing is scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Parkman Junior High 
School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get three votes at the commission level and win, then she needs 11 votes 
at the City Council to override. All we need are six council votes," Spound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Wednesday night with members of the chamber's development and 
environment committee, Spound complained that Picus was being unduly swayed "by 
a cacophony of noise from the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, which is 
opposed to all growth. 
</P>
<P>
"If our development goes down in flames, the precedent will be set. Any 
organization loud enough . . . can force their wishes on your property," 
proving that "a developer may be better off not working with the community 
because all it will cost you is interest payments on your land." 
</P>
<P>
That contention was denied by Jim Dawson, who is Picus' chief land-use deputy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Years of Debate 
</P>
<P>
Dawson told chamber committee members who were meeting at the Blue Cross 
headquarters in Warner Center that Picus acted to oppose Spound's office 
project after listening to two years of debate. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said Spound tried hard to persuade residents of the Carlton Terrace 
neighborhood to support his project. That effort included door-to-door 
canvassing and distribution of a frequent newsletter called "Let's Talk." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he made a sincere and admirable try, he didn't succeed," Dawson 
said. "Our opinion is he failed. He did not convince the community that an 
office building is best for that site." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson brushed aside suggestions that the west San Fernando Valley councilwoman 
was swayed by a few loud voices that do not accurately reflect the community. 
He told the group that council members are rarely overruled by colleagues on 
land-use issues affecting their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Spound retorted that Picus broke a pledge not to take a position on the issue 
until all the facts were in -- including an environmental impact report on the 
project.

FIRM TO REMOVE DEAD TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has awarded a $50,000 contract to remove 
584 dead eucalyptus trees and clear dead branches from 284 other trees, all on 
city-owned parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The areas slated for the work make up about 10% of the public parkland and 
include the infested areas that are most visible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The work, which will begin in about two weeks, is the city's first major effort 
to combat the Australian eucalyptus long-horned borer beetle, which is killing 
eucalyptus trees in many areas of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The inch-long beetle, which deposits its eggs under the bark of eucalyptus 
trees, was brought to the area in wood shipped from Australia in 1984. It has 
since proliferated from San Diego to Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract, Travers Tree Service, a Lomita firm, must bury the 
tainted wood in a landfill.

LACK OF PARKING TO BE ADDRESSED LATER; 
</P>
<P>
TOWN CENTER CHOSEN FOR PLANNED PENASQUITOS LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Libraries should be built in the center of things, where youngsters and 
oldsters can visit on foot, city planning commissioners unanimously decided 
Thursday in voting to put a proposed library in the Rancho Penasquitos Town 
Centre. 
</P>
<P>
An alternate library site on the rim of Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve was 
championed by city librarian Bill Sannwald, who pointed out that parking in the 
commercial center would be nearly impossible, but commissioners decided to 
solve that problem later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Debate Over Need 
</P>
<P>
Though nearly all of Rancho Penasquitos' 33,000 residents favor construction of 
a larger library for the community, the issue of where the building should go 
has split the San Diego suburb for nearly two years, since Councilwoman Abbe 
Wolfsheimer proposed the alternate site on city open space at the preserve's 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
The issue won't be settled until the City Council makes the final ruling at a 
hearing expected to be held before April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Newland California, a major Penasquitos developer, has promised to donate the 
1.5-acre town center site for the library if a site decision is made by April 
1. If not, the land will be granted to the YMCA for parking for its proposed 
building and day-care center, the developer said. 
</P>
<P>
The alternate site, half a mile south of the town center, drew opposition from 
some nearby residents because of added noise and traffic it would bring. It was 
also opposed by some environmentalists, who felt that the site was part of the 
canyon preserve and that the library would set a precedent for further 
intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
Sannwald conceded that the town center was more accessible for pedestrians and 
motorists, but he stressed that an earlier approval of the YMCA building meant 
that there would not be adequate parking for either facility. 
</P>
<P>
The alternate site, near Calle de las Rosas and Salmon River Road, contains 5.3 
acres, adequate for the library, parking and natural landscaping to tie the 
library in with the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Convenience 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lynn Benn echoed the comments of several planning board members 
when she commented that the library should be near schools and elderly housing 
so residents without cars can reach it on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many latchkey children nowadays, and they should have positive 
places to go after school," Benn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Zaworski-Burke, a Penasquitos activist, said the community 
"desperately needs both the library and the Y." She argued that the remaining 
vacant land within the town center could not accommodate the space needs of 
both ventures. She favored relocating the library to the canyon rim as the best 
solution for the situation, which, she said, resulted from "poor planning." 
</P>
<P>
City planner Mike Westlake said his department favored the town site because 
putting the library on the canyon would harm the neighborhood by increasing 
density, raising traffic to 38% over rated street capacity and damaging the 
view with grading on the canyon rim.

SUN TO SHINE FOR SPORTS, BUT SUNDOWN MAY BRING CHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lots of sunshine and low humidity, courtesy of a weak Santa Ana condition, are 
in store for San Diego this weekend, the National Weather Service says. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans may want to head outdoors to bask in the sunshine and enjoy the 
mild daytime temperatures seemingly tailor-made for outdoor sports. 
</P>
<P>
However, the nighttime lows are expected to get a bit chilly. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be wide swings in the temperatures," forecaster Wilbur Shigehara 
said. "It looks like a nice weekend for outdoor activities. But, at night, it 
will be chilly enough to have frost inland and maybe a touch of frost near the 
beaches, but nothing too serious. Maybe some growers may want to do a touch of 
frost protection." 
</P>
<P>
The sunshine and dry conditions with no storms in sight for at least the next 
week are a concern for water conservation, Shigehara said. Entering the third 
year of drought, forecasters are noticing that the current wind patterns are 
similar to the drought patterns of 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice that we have lots of sunshine, but this is the time of the year that 
we have to accumulate rain," Shigehara said. "The early season rains have not 
done much. We are at a crucial time where we should receive a lot of rain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time we need rain. We are 20% behind schedule in rainfall (from) 
where we should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend daytime temperatures are expected to fluctuate by only a few 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal regions will reach 63 to 68 degrees, with nighttime lows from 37 to 
45, Shigehara said. Inland highs will range 65 from 72, dropping to lows of 32 
to 40 degrees at night. Mountain areas are expected to hit 40 to 47 degrees 
during the day, falling to 20 to 30 at night. In the desert, highs of 65 to 72 
and lows of 32 to 40 are expected. 
</P>
<P>
High temperatures for the beaches will be 57 to 62 today through Sunday, with 
lows in the 40s. Waves are expected to be 3 to 4 feet, with the water 
temperature at 54 degrees.

MARTINEZ FINDS HAPPINESS STARTS RIGHT AT HOME

<DATELINE>

MAGUAYO, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here he comes, he and that smile. It's a big smile that would show plenty of 
teeth except every tooth was removed a couple of years ago because relatives 
were afraid he'd bite his tongue out. 
</P>
<P>
Here he comes, walking the same street he has walked for as long as anybody can 
remember. He'll get to the end, turn around, and walk back again, this being 
the only long street in this crazy little town. 
</P>
<P>
"Here he comes," Carmelo Martinez says from his spot on a road-side bench. 
"Crazy cousin Raoul." 
</P>
<P>
"Que pasa?" says Raoul. 
</P>
<P>
"Que pasa?" says Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Cousin Raoul leaps into a Spanish monologue about friendship and the weather 
and life. Martinez looks up and listens as if Cousin Raoul were Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez finally sticks out the palm of his left hand. Cousin Raoul clasps it 
with his right hand, and then Cousin Raoul is gone. Smiling, looking again for 
the end of the road, walking as if he hopes he never finds it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice guy, my cousin," Martinez says. "They say he was fine until he spent a 
little time in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez leans back, lets out a big laugh and wiggles his toes. It is 3 p.m., 
and the Padres' outfielder is bare-footed. If today is like most others he has 
spent among a couple hundred people in the middle of farmlands, he will remain 
bare-footed until somebody gently points out his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"My cousin, he means well," Martinez says, seriously now. "All he wants is for 
people to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Still staring out at the street, Martinez sips on a plastic cup filled with 
coconut water and a splash of whiskey. He chews on some fried and buttered 
bananas he coerced out of a neighbor lady -- he caught her stirring a black 
boiling pot in her garage, she had no choice. Then he licks a finger. 
</P>
<P>
"My crazy cousin," he announces finally, with satisfaction. "He's the kind of 
guy, everybody likes him." 
</P>
<P>
Most island baseball players fly west across the Atlantic Ocean each spring in 
search of fame and fortune and acid-washed jeans. In Carmelo Martinez's 5 years 
with the Padres -- during which he has silently and smilingly struggled through 
a variety of benchings and trade rumors before finally becoming a regular late 
last year -- he has always seemed different. 
</P>
<P>
After spending a day with him in his rural hometown of tiny houses and open 
arms, it is obvious that he is different. 
</P>
<P>
At 28, Carmelo Martinez wants most to make people happy and be liked. Truth be 
told, he thinks Cousin Raoul is not so crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"What is wrong with going through life just wanting to be happy?" Martinez 
asks. "I feel no pressure, because there is no pressure. I not complain, 
because there is nothing to complain about." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, for the first time, that feeling was noticed, and appreciated and 
rewarded. Given a full-time starting left-field job in August in one of Manager 
McKeon's lineup switches, Martinez hit 11 homers with 34 RBIs in the season's 
final 38 games. He won several games with big late-inning hits, turning him 
into a big hit, earning him standing ovations that he still hears this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the greatest things to see, after all that kid has put up with," 
McKeon said. "Intentionally or not, he has been snubbed over the years and has 
always put up with it, and now it is paying off. And it's all his attitude. 
That's what we admire most about him, that way he looks at things." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez grins as he begins the 4-minute tour of his hometown. "Life is not all 
baseball," he said. "Life is here." 
</P>
<P>
Here is Maguayo, on Puerto Rico's north shore, 10 minutes and 10,000 years from 
the closest city, the resort area of Dorado. We offer these directions because 
"here" is not on any map. According to Martinez, the village is inhabited by 
three families, with the last names of Montanez, Salgado and Rivera. The years 
have turned the three families into one, if not in blood then in heart, a group 
of friends living on 1 mile of thin roads that also hold four bars and a couple 
of shops, an elementary school and baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's mother was a Salgado. She and his grandmother raised him in a small 
3-bedroom house on the main road, with one bedroom always vacant because the 
women slept together after Martinez's father left home when Carmelo was 4. The 
house is still there, with its tiny yard and the white bars on the window, 
simply because his mother won't leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talk about, when they become a star, buying their mother a house," 
Martinez said. "Well, I try, I try. She won't move." 
</P>
<P>
When his grandmother got sick this winter, she wouldn't move either. For 3 
consecutive days, while his mother worked as a laundry supervisor at one of the 
Dorado hotels, Martinez tried to convince his grandmother to leave her bedroom 
and go to a hospital. She wouldn't. The next day she had a stroke and died. 
</P>
<P>
"You see what it is like here?" Martinez asks softly. "Different things are 
important here." 
</P>
<P>
So now Martinez won't move either. The tour begins with his house, a one-level 
stone structure that could belong to anyone. Located several blocks from his 
mother's place, it sits amid a small group of older houses abutting a farm 
where they are said to grow some of the greenest grass in the world. Not that 
this is rural, but neither his street nor the streets around him have names. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly lady, arms full of sheets just pulled from the line, stalks from her 
house to check out Martinez's guest. She stares at him. She sticks her face to 
the window of his rental car and stares into the back seat. She makes a Spanish 
pronouncement and walks away. 
</P>
<P>
"Said she liked the car," Martinez said, shrugging. "These people, they watch 
out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Just as he does for them. He is not known as Carmelo here, but as "Bitu," 
which, loosely translated, refers to the tar they spread on streets. They say 
his father gave him the name as a boy, but it is most appropriate now; Bitu has 
spread himself thick across the lives of his hometown friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," he says while walking through his house, "that there isn't 
anybody in here right now. Usually all kinds of kids come over and just hang 
around. They want to watch me work out, help me work out. I end up stepping on 
a couple of them, and then finally I yell, 'Out, out.' And the next day they 
are back. I guess they know I don't mean it." 
</P>
<P>
You can hardly blame them. There is a nifty weight room in his garage, and his 
back yard is taken up with a batting cage and pitching machine, complete with 
an old mattress for a backstop. All of it is surrounded with sound from a 
stereo system that can light up the village. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the air-conditioning. In a bit of Martinez's special wisdom, 
instead of using central air to cool the house, he has three separate wall 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"So if one breaks down, I can move the other ones around and still say cool," 
Martinez said. "If I have central air, and it breaks down, I burn." 
</P>
<P>
After working daily in his home, he and friends drive the two blocks to his 
boyhood ballpark to take ground balls. On this day the drive takes him past the 
wave of a teen-aged girl who is entering a tiny shack. He frowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful girl, just 15 years old, all the young guys in town were after her," 
he says. "But now she's pregnant, and nobody wants her. 
</P>
<P>
"But you wait. They will find the father. He will pay. You don't do that sort 
of thing to us." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez fairly jumps out of the car when it stops at moderate, dirt-infield 
ballpark wedged between several houses and a church. No name, no bases, but his 
park. Martinez's eyes immediately focus on a spot beyond left field, a back 
yard covered with an awning. During his professional tryout here 10 years ago, 
using strange wooden bats for the first time, he broke three on the first three 
pitches. Given his old aluminum bat, he immediately hit the ball so hard it 
carried into that back yard and broke through the awning. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond right field is the huge sign for Carmelina's Place Bar. It is underneath 
this sign many years ago that Martinez would spot his mother, screaming at him 
to come home for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
On this cloudless day, he climbs into the empty third-base bleachers, leans 
back under a weeping willow tree and closes his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I come here and close my eyes and fall asleep," he says, looking 
over to the first-base bleachers, where three snoozing citizens have beaten him 
to it. "I could sleep all day here." 
</P>
<P>
An old man with a Dodger cap shouts to Martinez from the street. Martinez 
shouts back. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the guy his hat," Martinez said. "Anybody you see around with a big 
league cap or something, chances are I brought it back to them. What, they can 
buy them here?" 
</P>
<P>
Turning back to the field, Martinez talks about something else he has helped 
give Maguayo. It's called "Juegos del Pavo," the Turkey Game. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. Thanksgiving, a time when many in the states are beginning to put 
their turkeys in the oven, Martinez and friends are putting bats in the racks, 
bases on the field, and a calf on a spit. It's an all-day, slow-pitch baseball 
festival, with as many games and teams and laughs as they fit in until 
midnight. Participants are required to donate one case of beer, $10 and their 
favorite food. Last Thanksgiving, Martinez, who is so involved in organizing 
that he rarely plays in more than two of the 5-inning games, collected 67 cases 
of beer and used the money to buy a 157-pound calf. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you people in the states have fun on Thanksgiving?" Martinez asks. 
"You should come here." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez did something else at last year's fourth annual event that raised 
eyebrows. He sold T-shirts with pictures of himself. But not for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"My cousin's little girl has gone blind," he explained. "She needed a trip to 
Chicago for another operation. The T-shirts gave her that trip." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez already had paid for the girl's first operation. Friends say he pays 
for much more here than he will admit. Just look at the Juvenile League 
uniforms in nearby Dorado, they say. On the backs of many of them are the names 
Neggie or Natalie. Those are the names of Martinez's wife and daughter. He 
bought the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Look even closer. An entire Juvenile League is named after him. 
</P>
<P>
"Family, man," Martinez said. "It's all family." 
</P>
<P>
The cousin. The cousin's daughter. The old lady. The old man. The pregnant 
girl. The Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell everybody back there that I am ready for a great year," Martinez tells 
his visitor. "Tell them it's been a great winter."

ORTMAYER SHOULD BE COACH, TOO

<P>
Turns out the best candidate for the Chargers' vacant head coaching job has 
been right in our midst all along. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of owner Alex Spanos' most trusted lieutenants. And he is a lifelong 
confidante of Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
"He" is Steve Ortmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Himself. 
</P>
<P>
His nibs. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say Ortmayer will hire himself. He has denied from the beginning 
that he is a candidate. And he repeated that denial as recently as Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought about the idea of Ortmayer hiring Ortmayer, Spanos said: 
"I can't even imagine anybody asking that question." 
</P>
<P>
But it is food for thought. And Ortmayer knows food almost as well as he knows 
football. Alas, he will probably be annoyed and surprised if and when he reads 
this. Distractions are not on his agenda these days. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that all the other top candidates are gone. Former Browns Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer will run the Chiefs in 1989. George Seifert, the former San 
Francisco defensive coordinator, will coach the 49ers next season. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Redskin assistant Dan Henning is still available. But nobody has yet 
accused him of being the next Vince Lombardi. Former Illinois Coach Mike White 
and Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator, have zero NFL head coaching 
experience between them. Which is not to suggest Lynn won't be a winning head 
coach in the NFL sometime soon. Hiring him to replace Al Saunders would be less 
of a risk than even the Chargers think. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that Ortmayer knows infinitely more about the Chargers' strengths and 
weaknesses than Henning or White. And if he names Lynn, overnight, he will have 
taken one of the top five assistants in the league and turned him into an 
inexperienced head coach. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of other reasons why Ortmayer is the best man for the job. To 
name a few: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He knows how to get along with Spanos, a demanding man who has been wildly 
successful in private business but who, like many owners, can be moody when his 
$80 million investment loses to the $80 million investment of the owner sitting 
in the luxury box across the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nobody knows better than Ortmayer the style of football he wants for the 
players he has been drafting since taking over the team 2 years ago today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And nobody knows better than Ortmayer which current Charger players should 
return in 1989 and which should not. Ortmayer is one of the few NFL general 
managers who attends practice every day his schedule permits. 
</P>
<P>
If the Chargers are as committed to continuity as they say, Ortmayer is the 
only logical choice. Lynn would stay in place. Highly respected special teams 
coach Wayne Sevier would stay in place. And Jerry Rhome, the offensive 
coordinator who had the Chargers running the ball as well as any team in the 
league at the end of 1988 despite a line comprising four free agents and a 
fourth-round rookie, would stay in place. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious rebuttal is Ortmayer's lack of head coaching experience. His 
critics say he coached only special teams in Kansas City before joining the 
Raider organization, for which he was nothing more than Al Davis' in-house spy. 
But Mike Ditka was nothing more than a special teams coach in Dallas when the 
Bears hired him in 1982. Four years later, they were world champions. 
</P>
<P>
And who will run the front office during the season, while Ortmayer is running 
from meetings to film sessions to practices to press conferences to TV shows to 
booster clubs 20 hours a day? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe Ortmayer doesn't have to be that kind of head coach. Maybe he can 
delegate a lot of the weekly coaching duties. Saunders failed as a 
supervisory-type coach. He should have been more hands-on. But Ortmayer would 
be the perfect hands-off coach. Moreover, he does not make rash decisions, a 
characteristic that would serve him well in the middle of a close game, late in 
the fourth quarter on a Sunday afternoon in December. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe Ortmayer can delegate much of the front office work as well. San 
Francisco's Bill Walsh served several productive years as the 49ers' president 
and head coach, using John McVay as his chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Ortmayer is the guy who traded Jim Lachey for John (400 Pounds Of) Clay 
and Napoleon (Beyond The Sea) McCallum. And sure, Ortmayer is the guy who 
brought us Barry Redden. Nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers are still a team in transition from the Gene Klein-Don Coryell 
era. Which is why Ortmayer is the right guy for this time. Let him coach for a 
year or 2 or 3 with Lynn as his plainly identified eventual successor. This 
gives Lynn a chance to be groomed, and it gives the Chargers a chance to find 
the right guy to replace Lynn -- maybe defensive line coach Gunther Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a joke, Steve. Hire yourself.

Barry Pederson scored two goals and Rich Sutter added a goal and two assists 
Thursday night to lead the Vancouver Canucks to a 6-2 victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Adams contributed the tie-breaking goal in the second period and Paul 
Reinhart had three assists as the Canucks, third in the NHL in fewest goals 
allowed, held the league's highest scoring club in check. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Bernie Nicholls scored a goal but fell two shy of becoming only 
the sixth player in NHL history to score at least 50 goals in 50 games or less. 
</P>
<P>
Just 45 seconds after Pederson's power-play goal brought the Canucks a 2-2 tie, 
Adams skated from behind the net and beat goalie Mark Fitzpatrick with a wrist 
shot with 3:49 left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Tanti then gave Vancouver a 4-2 lead with 9:59 left and Sutter added an 
insurance goal with a sharp-angle shot three minutes later. Pederson then 
concluded the scoring with 52 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller, acquired from Boston this week, had scored his first goal as a 
member of the Kings for a 2-1 lead 5:43 into the period. Luc Robitaille's shot 
deflected off the shaft of Miller's stick and trickled past goalie Kirk McLean 
and over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks, working with a 5-3 man advantage, scored first with Jim Sandlak's 
goal. Nicholls then tied it on the power play, taking a rebound of a shot by 
Wayne Gretzky and wristing it over McLean. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings gave up three power-play goals for the second time in as many games.

CRESPI NAMES LINS TO REPLACE REDELL AS FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Lins, a member of the Crespi High coaching staff for the past 6 years, was 
named Thursday to succeed Bill Redell as the school's head football coach. He 
was selected over fellow assistants Joel Wilker and Jim Benkert. 
</P>
<P>
Lins, 27, served as defensive coordinator last season, quarterback coach the 
season before and guided the Celts' sophomore team to records of 9-0-1 in 1985 
and 7-3 in 1986. He was a varsity assistant the previous 2 seasons after 
playing football at Cal Lutheran, Cerritos College and St. Paul High. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that Tim's experience and what we had seen here at Crespi made us 
confident that we made the right decision," Crespi Athletic Director Paul Muff 
said. "He's familiar with private high school football, coming from St. Paul, 
and I think Tim really learned from a pretty good situation here over the past 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
Lins, who graduated from Cal Lutheran in 1982, was an NAIA All-American tight 
end in his junior and senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real good about it," Lins said. "Like I tell everybody, it was like a 
dream come true. I was surprised, but I wanted the job. I didn't go into the 
interview for the experience." 
</P>
<P>
Redell resigned in December after compiling a 5-year record of 43-16-1 in 2 
separate stints at Crespi. Under Redell, the Celts won the Big Five Conference 
championship in 1986, the school's only Southern Section football title. Redell 
said that he recommended all 3 assistants upon leaving the position. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the world of all three of those guys," said Redell, who coached the 
defense at Cal Lutheran in Lins' junior year. "Tim is an outstanding coach. I 
think he brings a great rapport with the kids. They have great respect for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Lins was chosen by a 3-member panel composed of Crespi principal Father Joseph 
Atcher, Vice Principal Greg Gunn and Muff. The decision was made Tuesday and 
Lins met with team members Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lins said that he has asked Wilker and Benkert to remain with the football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have both of them back, but I don't know what's going to happen," 
he said. "I want them, and I told them that." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its recent success and the well-publicized exploits of All-American 
running back Russell White, Crespi has become one of the high-profile teams in 
the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill established a great program, he left a great program and he left things 
intact," Lins said. "Ever since I came to the school, that has been my goal -- 
to be head coach." 
</P>
<P>
White, however, will graduate this spring, as will All-Valley quarterback Ron 
Redell and All-Valley defensive lineman Quinn Fauria, among others. Lins said 
that the direction his team takes will depend on incoming personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more of a team-oriented kind of guy," he said. "I teach the team 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"And those guys are hard to replace."

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: EX-PREP CAGER SHINES IN LONE STAR STATE

Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers isn't the only basketball player with South Bay 
ties vying for an NCAA statistical title. 
</P>
<P>
Former Banning High star Eric Cooper, in his senior season at the University of 
Texas-San Antonio, is waging a hot battle for the free-throw championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 guard, a one-time South Bay Player of the Year, has led the nation 
for most of the season but slipped in the last week, missing two foul shots to 
fall below 90% for the first time. After going 0 for 1 Tuesday night, Cooper 
has hit 34 of 38 attempts, 89.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Going into a conference game Saturday against Hardin-Simmons, Cooper is San 
Antonio's top player, averaging 17.2 points and shooting 41% from 3-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Cooper averaged 13.8 points and set school records for 3-point 
baskets and attempts. He helped the Roadrunners win the Trans-America 
Conference postseason tournament to qualify for the NCAA playoffs, where he 
scored 17 points in a close loss to powerful Illinois. He was named to the 
Trans-America all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, considered the top high school guard in Los Angeles when he teamed with 
Joey Johnson to lead Banning to the City 4-A semifinals four years ago, took a 
circuitous route to the Texas school, which is not widely known outside the 
Trans-America Conference, which is not widely known outside Trans-America. 
</P>
<P>
The road to San Antone went through Tucson, where he originally signed to play 
for Lute Olson at the University of Arizona. Cooper found himself doing more 
sitting than playing in Olson's high-powered program. When Olson's assistant, 
Ken Burmeister -- who had recruited Cooper -- was hired as head coach at San 
Antonio two years ago, Cooper tagged along. 
</P>
<P>
Deep in the heart of Texas, Cooper has emerged as a legitimate pro prospect, 
and he's taking his best (foul) shot. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Gathers continues to lead the NCAA in scoring (33.6) and rebounding 
(14.5) in the latest national statistics. After Wednesday's 104-79 loss to 
Pepperdine, the Lions may have relinquished their national lead in team 
scoring, dipping to 110.4 points per game. Oklahoma, the only other team 
averaging triple figures, scored 122 Wednesday to improve to 110.5. At the 
other end of the spectrum in the West Coast Athletic Conference is St. Mary's, 
which has forged a 16-1 record by allowing only 55.5 points per game, second 
best defensive average in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In winning its seventh straight game, St. Mary's held Santa Clara to 48 points 
last weekend in a 28-point victory. Santa Clara shot only 27.7% on its home 
court against the Gaels' tough defense, which is holding opponents below 40% 
for the season. The Gaels are shooting 53%. Loyola is shooting 47.5% while 
opponents are hitting 54% from the field. However, the Lions lead the nation in 
3-point goals per game (9) and have made more 3-pointers (155) than all but two 
other WCAC teams have even attempted. 
</P>
<P>
In a computer rating system that ranks all 294 Division I schools for USA 
Today, St. Mary's is ranked eighth, with Pepperdine No. 66, Santa Clara No. 67 
and Loyola No. 69. 
</P>
<P>
The Candidate: In making a bid for Division II All-American honors, Anthony 
Blackmon continues to add new aspects to his game at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The senior center leads the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in scoring 
(19.7) and rebounding (9.6) and lately has been building up his assist totals. 
Blackmon entered the week averaging four assists in his last six games. Over 
the last nine games, Blackmon is averaging 20.5 points, 9.6 rebounds and three 
assists, capped by a near triple-double against Cal Poly Pomona Saturday as he 
recorded 18 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high seven assists. The 6-foot-7 
Blackmon has also blocked a shot in 14 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping Strategy: The Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn., whose teams 
have won every NCAA men's title since the inception of a postseason tournament 
in 1970, is recruiting far and wide to stay on top. Though the 10-team 
conference -- in full swing this week -- is dominated by players from 
California and Hawaii, there are several recruits from New York (West Islip and 
Orchard Park) and Pennsylvania (York and Pittsburgh) as well as from a handful 
of foreign countries: West Germany, Brazil, Israel, Australia and U.S. trust 
territories Puerto Rico and Guam.

College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Dominguez Hills basketball game against Cal State Northridge matches 
the coaches with the longest tenures in the CCAA. The Toros' Dave Yanai is 
176-133 in his 12th season. Northridge's Pete Cassidy is 267-202 in his 18th 
season. Both have winning percentages of .569. The two also have been at their 
schools longer than any other Division I or Division II coaches in the 
Southland. . . . The Toros have made 38 of their last 76 3-point shots, a 50% 
rate. Sophomore guard Bryan Dell'Amico has made nine of his last 16 and has 
made 22 of 44 for the season. . . . Northridge's starting lineup will include 
forward Derrick Gathers, brother of Loyola star Hank Gathers and one of 
Blackmon's contenders for CCAA scoring honors at 17.8, and former Redondo Union 
High guard Karl Becker, averaging 7.6 points. . . . Punter Trent Morgan of 
Northridge was named first-team All-American by the National Weekly Football 
Gazette. The Serra High graduate punted 59 times for a 43.5-yard average. . . . 
Loyola's Gathers, named WCAC Player of the Week for the second time this 
season, could go scoreless the next 10 games and would still be averaging 
nearly 21 points. . . . Loyola guard Bo Kimble, recovering from knee surgery, 
has returned to a limited practice schedule but is not expected to suit up 
Sunday against Pepperdine. He may see action Tuesday in a non-conference game 
against U.S. International. Kimble scored 92 points in three games against 
Pepperdine last season.

SYLMAR PLAYER FACES CHARGES IN ASSAULT ON BASKETBALL REFEREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Sylmar High basketball player was arrested on suspicion of assault Thursday 
after he allegedly hit a referee Wednesday after his team lost to Birmingham 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The player -- who is not being identified because he is a minor -- was released 
into his father's custody. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Caldwell, one of the officials for the game Wednesday, filed a complaint 
Thursday with the Foothill Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
according to Detective James Soles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Angelo Porco, a Sylmar assistant principal who witnessed the 
incident, Caldwell was struck on the right side of the face in the parking lot 
after Sylmar's 57-52 loss in the East Valley League game at Sylmar High. "It's 
unfortunate," Porco said. "He's a very gifted athlete, but he just completely 
lost his cool." 
</P>
<P>
Porco said that he will file a report on the incident today with the City 
Section office. 
</P>
<P>
Porco, who is also Sylmar's administrator in charge of athletics, said that the 
player has been suspended from school and faces expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"We will follow board policy and recommend that he be expelled," Porco said.

CSUN TUMBLES AFTER BOWSER TAKES A SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge sustained a loss on the basketball court Thursday night, 
the sting of which presumably will soon go away. 
</P>
<P>
But another loss, one that took place in the second row of CSUN bleachers 
behind the Chapman College bench, may well plague the Matadors for a longer 
time. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that Matador center Todd Bowser lay after crashing into the stands 
while chasing a loose ball in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Through the chairs along the sideline he roared before coming to a sudden stop 
when his shoulder and left hip slammed hard into the wooden bleachers. The 6-8, 
280-pound junior stayed down for several minutes before being helped into the 
locker room, proving once and for all what CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy has claimed 
all along -- some things hurt no matter how big you are. 
</P>
<P>
A 79-74 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. loss to Chapman hurt plenty. But 
not as much as the loss of personnel should Bowser, a 3-year starter, be out 
for any length of time. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser will be X-rayed at CSUN at 9:30 this morning. The extent of the damage 
is not known, Cassidy said after conferring with trainers, but it appeared that 
Bowser's left hip temporarily had been dislocated, then popped back into place. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser was walking gingerly on crutches after the game. The Matadors were 
already playing shorthanded -- Leroy McCullough is at best temporarily 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge missed Bowser's productivity -- he came in averaging 14.2 points and 
8.3 rebounds a game -- but most of all his imposing presence inside the key on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman center Mark Hilton, who came in averaging all of 3.9 points a game, led 
the Panthers with 20 -- making 7 of 10 field-goal attempts and 6 of 8 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Northridge resorted to dialing long distance, which meant Derrick 
Gathers was fairly arm weary afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 junior scored a game-high 25 points, making half of his 16 field-goal 
attempts, including 6 of 11 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' 6 3-point baskets tied a school mark and the Matadors attempted 24 and 
made 12, both school records. 
</P>
<P>
"That's indicative of not working hard to get the ball inside," Cassidy said of 
the abundance of 3-point baskets. "The three-point shot is a double-edged 
sword." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Chapman both are 2-2 in CCAA play. CSUN is 11-6 overall; Chapman 
is 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who had been fighting the flu, equaled his season high, but in the 
last 12 minutes he scored only 6 points on 2 3-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good tonight," he said. "I just didn't get it done when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers had 16 in the first half, including 11 in a row in a stretch of less 
than 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The teams exchanged the lead several times in the second half with Chapman 
holding the biggest edge, 43-37, early in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy shuffled his lineup often as he was forced to try combinations that had 
not played together this season. 
</P>
<P>
At one stage in the second half, the 5 players the Matadors had on the floor 
were averaging only 21.7 points a game combined. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 66-66, with 3 minutes left when Hilton broke free for a 
layup that put Chapman in the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers stretched their advantage to 72-66 with a minute left, then made 
the front end of 5 consecutive 1-and-1 free-throw situations.

AS COACHING GOES, SHIMIZU SHOWS HE'S A GOOD SCOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The approaches of Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell and Kennedy Coach Yutaka 
Shimizu, in terms of pregame scouting, are decidedly different. The results, 
though, are often similar: Cleveland (16-2, 6-0 in league play) and Kennedy 
(12-4, 5-1) will play for first place in the North Valley League at 7 tonight 
at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu prefers to see an opponent play as many times as possible. Braswell 
does not spend nearly as much time scouting. In fact, Braswell simply would 
prefer to see a lot less of Shimizu. 
</P>
<P>
"Shim's the tactician, the magician," Braswell said. "I don't even waste my 
time sending anybody over to scout his games because it wouldn't do any good. 
He just changes everything all around every game." 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu feels otherwise. Braswell, in fact, has a running gag with Shimizu and 
Taft Coach Jim Woodard, who also has scouted several Cleveland games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I look up in the stands, I see those two," Braswell quipped. "I 
keep telling them that they've seen more Cleveland games than I have." 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu said that he scouts more games than Woodard and that there is a reason. 
</P>
<P>
"He remembers everything," Shimizu said of Woodard. "Not me, I have to see 
somebody two or three times before it sinks in. Heck, I just go from day to 
day." STEVE ELLING

BURROUGHS PUTS SAN GABRIEL AWAY

Using its superior quickness and balanced scoring, Burroughs High rolled over 
San Gabriel, 77-57, Thursday night at Burroughs to remain undefeated in the 
Foothill League. 
</P>
<P>
In the early going it did not appear that the Indians would win so handily as 
the Matadors (3-15, 0-6 in league play) played stingy defense and trailed only 
40-35 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel's Dean Smith closed the gap to 22-20 on a 4-foot shot with 2 
seconds left in the first quarter. It was not until late in the second quarter 
that Burroughs (14-5, 6-0) began to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to hold them down to our level and cause a lot of turnovers early," 
San Gabriel Coach Tim Knight said. "They are superior to us in every way, and 
unless we do this we'll get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Center Tom Clemens scored a team-high 18 points for Burroughs, which is ranked 
10th in the Valley by The Times. Guard Marnie Calderon added 16 points. ROCKY

13 EL CAMINO GRIDDERS SIGN WITH MAJOR 4-YEAR COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Once again El Camino was somewhat of a football camp for big colleges. Last 
year 22 members of the Warrior state champion club went on to play at four-year 
schools. Twenty are at Division I schools, two at Division II campuses. 
</P>
<P>
This season 17 El Camino players have signed with four-year schools, 13 with 
Division I programs and four at the Division II level. Seven others are 
expected to sign in June. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have committed include wide receiver Mike Jones (Washington State), 
wide receiver Bryan Burnett and running back Aaron Craver (Fresno State) 
offensive lineman Brian Conners (University of Pacific), offensive lineman Pat 
Hunt and place-kicker Dominic Cefalone (Texas El Paso), running back Blackie 
Poti (University of Hawaii), tackle Tim Drevno (Cal State Fullerton) and guard 
Mark Merritt (Eastern Michigan). 
</P>
<P>
Defensive players who have signed are linebacker Paul Hill (Oregon State), 
defensive back Larry Bonner and linebacker Ed Ulufanua (Pacific), linebacker 
Tui Suiaunoa (Texas El Paso), lineman Bruce Clark (Cal State Northridge), 
linemen Pat Wilkinson and Mark Comings (St. Mary's) and Alan Banks (Fort Hays 
State). 
</P>
<P>
Three Harbor football players have signed with Division I schools. Offensive 
tackle John Taotoai and place-kicker Luis Solorio will be teammates next year 
at the University of Florida. Wide receiver Archie Jean will play at the 
University of Nevada Las Vegas and defensive tackle Aaron Pulliam is expected 
to sign with San Jose State in June. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's basketball game against Cerro Coso last week will be remembered for 
several reasons. First, two key Harbor players didn't show up. One was involved 
in a car accident and the other had family problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tip-off was delayed 10 minutes because both teams had gold uniforms. The 
Seahawks had to break out ragged old blue jerseys that were used about five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were real old and tight," said freshman guard Vernon Middleton. "It was 
kind of uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The evening will also be memorable because it marked the Seahawks' (12-9, 5-2) 
first Southern California Athletic Conference loss of the season. On Wednesday 
they lost their second SCAC game, 87-66, to L.A. City. 
</P>
<P>
Marymount basketball Coach Jim Masterson practically guaranteed before the 
season that his third-year program would have a good campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Buy now the Mariners are the Southern California Athletic Conference cellar 
team. Marymount has the state's fourth leading scorers in guard Ernie Woods and 
forward James Anderson. Both average 24.9 points a game and Anderson is the 
state's top rebounder with an average of 13. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the boost provided by the two sophomores isn't enough to save the 
Mariners (4-17, 0-7). Lately they've lacked the manpower to run the fast 
offense that Masterson likes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in last week's 98-83 loss to Harbor, Marymount was missing three 
key players who were academically ineligible. That cut the roster to six, and 
as if things weren't bad enough, Trevor Tapscott, the lone reserve, sprained an 
ankle. That left Marymount with its starting five. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we just ran out of gas," Masterson said. "We've had to stop our 
running game and our break. It's been pretty difficult because we've worked on 
our running game in the preseason and now we have to slow them down. It's been 
a tough transition, but without the horses to run up and down the court we 
can't do it. We've had to change our style." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino forward Cheri Bullet is the state's leading rebounder with an average 
of 15.9. The 6-foot freshman is also the team's second leading scorer (12.9 
points a game). In last week's 71-67 victory over Mt. San Antonio College, 
Bullet scored 28 points for the Warriors, who are 12-4 (4-2 in the SCC) after 
Wednesday's 73-60 victory over Pasadena.

FOURTH LEADING JC SCORER IN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
ERNIE WOODS ON FIRE, BUT FOR A LOSING CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN BANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Marymount Palos Verdes College (4-17) has a seven-game losing streak, 
Ernie Woods is playing winning basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Woods has been on fire during the last seven games. He scored 35, 38, 18, 33, 
31, 24 and 30 points and set two tournament free throw records during the 
Christmas break at the Rancho Santiago College Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Woods and Marymount forward James Anderson are the state's fourth leading 
scorers with a 24.9 average. Not bad for the 6-3 sophomore from Chadwick School 
who was not recruited by Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say we got him in the 11th-and-a-half hour," Coach Jim Masterson 
said. "He called me a few weeks before school started last year. Ernie told me 
that he had all but decided to attend college in Idaho but didn't think he 
would be happy there." 
</P>
<P>
"I could not see myself playing basketball in Idaho for four years," Woods 
said. "A friend who played at Marymount last year told me about Marymount. I am 
glad I came here." 
</P>
<P>
Woods played point guard for the first half of last season and averaged nine 
points. Masterson moved him to off-guard midway through the year because of 
injuries to other players. 
</P>
<P>
Woods was hesitant: "I had played at the point position my whole life and I 
thought that the move would hurt my chances of playing point guard at a 
Division I school once I left Marymount." 
</P>
<P>
Masterson persuaded Woods that the team would be better with him at off-guard. 
After the switch, Masterson said he noticed something about Woods' play 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew that Ernie could be a scorer," Masterson said. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the first time one of Woods' coaches took note of his ability to 
score. His high school coach, Tom Myer, watched Woods' offensive game emerge. 
"When he came to us, he was truly little Ernie," Myer said. "He was very thin 
and very quick. I never doubted his ability to score, but he did this funny 
little hitch in his shot." 
</P>
<P>
Woods is emotional, and no one knows about that better than his mother, 
Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie has always been a very emotional person," she said. "When he was a 
child, he would cry after his team lost a game. I coached him in basketball 
when he was 9 and told him to get used to crying because the team wasn't very 
good and would not win many games." 
</P>
<P>
Said Masterson: "Ernie is a very emotional player. Sometimes it's good because 
his inspiration sparks the other players. Sometimes it works against him 
because he gets down on himself when things don't go the way he wants them to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Woods agreed: "I just want to do whatever it takes for our team to win. I hate 
to lose in anything. No matter how many points I score, if we lose, I always 
say to myself that there must have been something more I could have done so our 
team could win. I have got to learn to play as hard as I can, and if we lose, 
that's all right because I have given it my all." 
</P>
<P>
Woods' desire to be successful goes beyond the basketball court. Myer recalled 
his first encounter with him: "It was after we had won a playoff game. I was 
talking to a couple of reporters and this little skinny kid comes up to me and 
introduced his mom and himself and said, 'I want to come to your school and 
play on your team.' That was the first time a kid had come up like that. It 
just kinda blew me away. I told him to call the school." 
</P>
<P>
Woods' mother recalled: "Ernie had been attending Southern California Military 
Academy, and when he was in the ninth grade wanted to go to Chadwick." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't score high enough on the entrance exam to be admitted to Chadwick. 
His mother said he came home and cried, but he continued to study and passed 
the exam the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Woods and his mother have a special relationship. "I was both his mother and 
father," she said. "Since his father was not around, I raised Ernie and his 
older brother, Eric. I coached Ernie's basketball team, and showed him how to 
catch a baseball and hit. I guess I am probably his biggest critic." 
</P>
<P>
Ernie agreed: "I am pretty close to my mother. She comes to all of my games. My 
mother has always been there for me. One thing she does is speak exactly what's 
on her mind."

JENNINGS WILL STAY WITH FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Jennings, who started at fullback for the San Diego State football team 
last season but then considered transferring after being moved to linebacker, 
will stay and play offensive guard, Coach Al Luginbill said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said last month that he had received permission from SDSU Athletic 
Director Fred Miller to contact other schools about transferring. But Luginbill 
said Jennings has decided to remain at SDSU after a meeting in which it was 
decided he would be moved to guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim was excited about the switch," Luginbill said. "It was an idea that we 
have been kicking around. Jim felt more comfortable with trying guard. It 
should be an easier transition." 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said he considered leaving after the fullback position was eliminated 
as part of Luginbill's proposed switch to a one-back offense. Jennings, a 
6-foot 4-inch, 245-pound freshman from San Marcos High School, started all but 
one game for the Aztecs last season after red-shirting in 1987. He was third on 
the team in rushing with 31 carries for 104 yards and 1 touchdown and seventh 
in receptions with 13 for 81 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said is optimistic about the Aztecs' chances for landing a strong 
group of recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill, who said he has been active in most areas of the state, said the 
Aztecs have 25 scholarships available and that he expects to award all of them 
beginning Feb. 8, the first day high school seniors may sign national letters 
of intent. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven seniors have announced oral commitments to attend SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
One community college player who reportedly has made a commitment will not 
enroll for the start of the spring semester. Calvin Thomas, a defensive lineman 
from Compton Community College, was not granted admission to SDSU and will have 
to find another school. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Brad Burton, who missed the final four games last season 
because of a staph infection in his ankle, is questionable for the start of 
spring practice April 3, trainer Brian Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said team physicians want to be sure Burton has completely recovered from 
the infection before allowing him to practice. Burton wears a brace on his 
ankle and has not been given permission to resume working out, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill also said that he has asked offensive tackle Joe Heinz to lose 65 
pounds before the start of spring practice. Luginbill said Heinz already has 
lost 30 pounds, down to 300, and that he wants him to report to spring practice 
at 265. Heinz, a 6-3 freshman from Chula Vista High School, red-shirted last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Three of former Coach Denny Stolz's four assistant coaches who were not 
retained by Luginbill have found employment elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Hoke has moved to Kent State as secondary coach. Wayne Moses is at New 
Mexico as running backs coach. And Mike Nelson is coaching the defensive line 
at Kansas State. Only Dana Bible, offensive coordinator under Stolz, has not 
accepted a new position. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs open their baseball season Wednesday at home against University of 
San Diego, but they will get an unofficial start Sunday with an alumni game at 
Smith Field at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The game is part of a weekend of baseball alumni activities that begin with a 
golf tournament Saturday and continue Sunday starting with an old-timers game 
at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Dietz figures to have one of his stronger teams in recent years -- 
the entire starting rotation returns from a team that finished 47-18-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are ranked 15th in Baseball America and 26th in Collegiate Baseball 
preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec volleyball team will play host to the 8-team Asics Tiger tournament 
this week at three sites in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
All eight teams are in the Top 20 in Volleyball Monthly magazine's preseason 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 SDSU will open in Pool A against No. 15 Navy at 10 a.m. in the Horizon 
International Athletic Center. The Aztecs will close Pool A play against No. 5 
UC Santa Barbara at 8 p.m. Rounding out Pool A is No. 11 Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 UC San Diego will play in Pool B against No. 9 Cal State Long Beach at 
noon and against No. 13 Rutgers Newark at 6 p.m. Pool B matches will be held at 
the Lawrence Jewish Community Center in La Jolla. No. 2 Hawaii is the pool's 
top team. 
</P>
<P>
Final-round play will be held at Peterson Gym begining at 11 a.m. and 
concluding with the championship game at 7:30 p.m.

INTERACTION WITH AUDIENCE BECOMES A KEY INGREDIENT IN ARTIST'S WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE ZIAYA, Ziaya is a frequent contributor to Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Naidus believes that she is a social activist as well an an artist. Her 
work relentlessly reminds onlookers of the injustices in our society and the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have access to space, I have access to raising consciousness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So when an exhibit of her work opens Monday at the Main Gallery of Cal State 
Northridge, Naidus hopes that her audience will find her work, at the very 
least, provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Three of her audience-participatory installations will be on display through 
Feb. 24. Viewers are encouraged to share their reactions, and their feedback is 
subsequently incorporated into Naidus' creations. Such interaction is her 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the installations, "Please Take a Number" and "This Is Not a Test," have 
been exhibited before. In the former, viewers, with their shoes removed, 
actually walk on top of the art, which is a maze with a series of platforms on 
which people can stand. As they proceed through the maze, participants are 
faced with the juxtaposition of confronting the world's problems versus the 
individual need and desire to escape through drugs, TV, shopping and the like. 
</P>
<P>
In "This Is Not a Test," Naidus presents an eerie scenario of what the world 
will be like in the event of a nuclear war. A bedroom in shambles sets the mood 
for this work, as slides commemorating the beauty of nature flash in front of 
the dreary backdrop. An audiotape expresses the thoughts common to many people 
-- they never realized a nuclear holocaust could really happen. 
</P>
<P>
Naidus' "The Nightmare Quilt" makes its debut in this show. Ninety-two painted 
images reveal both the evils that plague society and the possible alternatives 
that can bring about a better world. 
</P>
<P>
In all three works, viewers are invited to write down their nightmares, hopes, 
fears and dreams on slips of paper and then deposit them within the artwork. 
"If I can make one or two people out of 100 feel less isolated, then it's all 
worthwhile," Naidus said. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of having audience members reveal their feelings began by accident 
when Naidus exhibited "This Is Not a Test" at the New York Coliseum in 
Manhattan. "People left me notes under the bed," she recalled. "People wanted 
to talk about the issues. So, I thought, why not make the exhibits more of an 
invitation for people to speak out?" 
</P>
<P>
Also on exhibit at CSUN's gallery will be 12 drawings from Naidus' series 
"Taking the Empire's New Clothes to the Laundry." In each drawing, she depicts 
an environment and then proposes alternative behaviors -- for example, she has 
drawn a health club but then suggests that viewers might not necessarily 
benefit from the anxiety of working toward a perfect body. Once again, it is 
social change that Naidus is striving for. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Glenrock, N.J. -- a town that she describes as conservative -- 
Naidus studied art at Carlton College in Minnesota before moving to New York 
City in 1975. "I was interested in sociology, history, language, theater and 
art, and saw this as the best way to synthesize everything," she said. She 
received her master's degree from Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, where 
she said it was safe to experiment in new artistic genres. 
</P>
<P>
Naidus, 35, continues this tradition of exploring and encouraging the 
development of new methods of expression in a class, titled "Art and Social 
Issues/Mixed Media," that she teaches at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It proves a wonderful outlet for students," Naidus said. "Things they've 
experienced and issues that matter to them -- suicide, apathy, racism -- they 
can now include in their work." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the somewhat depressing quality of her work, Naidus is interested in 
focusing on the importance of change and choice. She sees the empowerment of 
people as a viable alternative to apathy and hopelessness. In keeping with this 
philosophy, from 1 to 4 p.m. Feb. 25, Naidus and social ecologist Bob Spivey 
will offer a free workshop at the Mai Gallery that deals with the individual's 
capacity for change and self-empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are aware of what is going on, but they become numb," she 
said. "There are a lot of things wrong in society, but people can still have a 
sense of hope. People need to know that we can have a future -- and not one of 
endless war, crime and fear. It all starts with individuals doing little 
things, getting involved. People need to hold on to their dreams for a better 
future because if we lose our dreams, we lose everything."

BLACKWELL'S LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that we have once again heard from the "high guru of fashion," Richard 
Blackwell, I must take exception to one of his remarks (Newsmakers, Part I, 
Jan. 12). 
</P>
<P>
As a retired librarian whose career does not date back to 1940, but whose age 
most certainly does, I must contend his odious comparison in reference to a 
"1940 unemployed librarian." Anyone unemployed in 1940 would have been 
hard-pressed to dress according to Blackwell's so-called standards. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell shows a lack of sensitivity in singling out for stereotyping a 
profession that has contributed much to the education, literacy and culture of 
many people and it should be viewed with dignity and respect. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, who really cares about Mr. Blackwell's list.

BARBARA BUSH ON ELEANOR ROOSEVELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an article on Barbara Bush (Part I, Jan. 15), Times staff writer Betty 
Cuniberti (who seems to be completely bowled over by Barb) quotes our new First 
Lady as saying, "I grew up in a household that detested her" (Eleanor 
Roosevelt). She then went on to discuss literacy, homelessness, working 
mothers, etc. These were all causes Mrs. Roosevelt took a personal, active 
interest in, went out and saw for herself what conditions were in those 
difficult days, and tried to use her influence to help. The abuse that was 
heaped upon her by the likes of Mrs. Bush's family and other privileged society 
folk has no comparison in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Roosevelt still stands as a shining light for so many people. She 
worked unceasingly and did not depend on high-priced ad men to chronicle her 
good deeds. May we all take a lesson from her selflessness and modesty! All the 
"thousand points of light" of this immorally expensive inaugural are but faint 
beams from mean-spirited, greedy men and women in comparison to Eleanor 
Roosevelt.

TEAMSTER DEAL: POOR SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The formula that the Justice Department has proposed for settling its ambitious 
racketeering lawsuit against the Teamsters Union is inadequate. In its attempt 
to rid the nation's largest union of corruption without a costly and 
time-consuming trial, the Justice Department is both going too far and not far 
enough. The likely result is that the Teamsters, whose documented ties to 
organized crime have made it practically a subsidiary of La Cosa Nostra, will 
once again elude real reform. 
</P>
<P>
In its original complaint last June the Justice Department sought to oust the 
Teamsters' entire governing board and to place the union under court 
trusteeship until free elections could be held. The suit, based on the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), was a last-gasp 
effort to achieve in civil court what the Justice Department had failed to 
achieve by prosecuting dozens of Teamster leaders and their allies in the mob. 
But the spectacle of the federal government's moving to take over an entire 
union, even one as tainted as the Teamsters, alarmed other labor leaders and 
inspired demands from 250 members of Congress that the Justice Department 
abandon its high-handed campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Now the prosecutors are backing off. As Times staff writer Robert L. Jackson 
has reported, the Justice Department has indicated that it will settle for the 
resignations of about half a dozen members of the 18-man board and a pledge 
from the survivors to institute internal reforms, including a secret-ballot 
election of the union's president. But that formula isn't much of a solution. 
</P>
<P>
For the government to force out members of a union board, chosen under 
procedures previously sanctioned by the government, sets an antidemocratic 
precedent. And it might mean little change in the union's character, because 
the bylaws permit Teamster President William J. McCarthy to appoint like-minded 
replacements. McCarthy has denied having personal ties to the New England Mafia 
-- as his predecessor, the late Jackie Presser, once told the FBI -- but at the 
very least he has been blind to the Mafia's penetration of the union. McCarthy 
recently admitted that he had never even discussed with other Teamster 
officials the charge of mob influence by the President's Commission on 
Organized Crime. Where has he been? In a hermetically sealed room? 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's willingness to allow the next Teamster president to be 
elected by a secret ballot of union convention delegates is also troubling. 
Those delegates are often appointed, not elected by the rank-and-file, and 
letting them vote in secret would make them even less accountable to the 
membership. The most democratic way to choose a Teamster president would be 
through a one-man, one-vote election of the entire membership. That is the 
course urged by Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the 8,000-member organization 
that has long been a thorn in the Teamsters' side. Some experts contend that 
the current leadership is so entrenched that a challenger could never win a 
plebiscite, but that has not been the case with the United Mine Workers, which 
overcame a long history of corruption and violence through popular elections. 
Many individual Teamsters hate the idea that their union is synonymous with the 
mob; they should be given a chance to vote their corrupt bosses out of office.

OPENING IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department is taking seriously an offer by leaders of El 
Salvador's guerrilla movement to participate peacefully in presidential 
elections later this year. A spokesman says that the government of President 
Jose Napoleon Duarte shares Washington's view of the proposal. It should be 
taken seriously enough for Duarte to call for resumption of negotiations with 
the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Previously the five guerrilla groups that make up the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front had refused to accept the legitimacy of the elections 
scheduled for March 19. They have been fighting the Salvadoran political system 
for almost 10 years, striking at governments run both by military juntas and, 
more recently, by U.S.-backed civilian leaders like Duarte. FMLN leaders 
insisted that their popular support could not be measured by voting, and they 
refused to lay down their arms until they were granted a share of political 
power in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Their offer to reverse that stance caught both the Duarte government and the 
Bush Administration -- still trying to get settled in Washington -- by 
surprise, although it is encouraging to see the White House recover so nimbly. 
The rebels did not change their position on giving up their arms, but they are 
willing to stop fighting for five days before the voting, to agree not to 
interfere with campaigning or balloting as they have done in past elections, 
and to accept the outcome of the vote. In return, they ask that the election be 
postponed until September and that the government guarantee the safe 
participation of their political representatives in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction in San Salvador was disappointingly legalistic. Government 
officials said that the voting cannot be postponed under the Salvadoran 
constitution. They seemed to overlook the fact that El Salvador's current 
constitution is only a few years old and was written under wartime conditions. 
Such documents can be revised when circumstances warrant, and this may be such 
a case. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte should brush aside extreme rightists and military leaders who want to 
reject the plan, and he should use the proposal as an opening to resume the 
dialogue that he began with the guerrillas three years ago and that has 
recently been stalled. The State Department's reaction certainly would 
strengthen Duarte's hand in any confrontation with the Salvadoran right. The 
United States provides about half the revenue that the Salvadoran government 
needs to operate -- not just to wage its counterinsurgency effort but also to 
feed its people. That alone should discourage extreme elements from trying to 
interfere in any way with the chances for peace. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 persons have died in the 10 years since the Salvadoran civil 
war broke out, and one-fifth of that small nation's 5 million people have been 
displaced by the fighting. For the last several months, since it was revealed 
that Duarte is dying of cancer, there has been no movement toward peace in the 
country. In fact, the war has actually escalated, with renewed atrocities 
committed by both sides. Until the rebel offer was made public, the prospects 
for an improvement of any sort in El Salvador were bleak. Now there is a 
glimmer of real hope that must not be extinguished without being fully 
explored.

PRIVATE CARE FOR THE RETARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a parent of a retarded child in Lanterman State Hospital, I would like to 
thank Hurst for his well-researched, informative series. We have always 
believed our daughter received excellent care there. Many of the staff on her 
ward have been there 8 to 10 years and longer, which indicates to me that 
working conditions must be decent. In addition, our daughter is happy and well 
cared for and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
They take her outings, buy her new clothes (with her SSI money), and take 
pictures of her various activities. They take great pride in her ward, painting 
and wallpapering during their off-hours and are now beginning a parents' group. 
</P>
<P>
But each year at our annual evaluation, the subject of community care comes up. 
We have always believed she is not a good candidate for this as she is very low 
functioning (about 3-year-old motor IQ -- and profoundly deaf). After reading 
Hurst's descriptions of community placement, which confirms what we had already 
heard, we shall continue to hold out strongly for keeping her where she is 
indeed "blossoming."

LONG BEACH STING WAS A STUNT AND A SMEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MEYER, Greg Meyer is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department 
and a former Long Beach police officer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been following the controversy over the police incident that was 
videotaped in Long Beach, you've already heard plenty from many commentators, 
including a law professor at Harvard. And you've heard from Don Jackson, the 
self-appointed sting operator who is a police sergeant on stress-disability 
leave from the city of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
For legal reasons you won't hear the involved Long Beach officer's version for 
some time. And for legal reasons you will probably never see the unbroadcast 
footage; NBC can be expected to stand on established case law that says the 
First Amendment allows it to keep its unused footage secret from you. 
</P>
<P>
I can't speak for all cops, but from my perspective of 13 years' experience I'd 
say that there certainly were some unusual aspects to this incident. 
Unfortunately, there was nothing unusual about Jackson's actions. Cops 
routinely have to deal with passively resisting suspects who flex their muscles 
and their mouths and want to split hairs over probable-cause issues that are 
better decided in courtrooms, not in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Many people have already judged the involved officer's escalating verbal 
attempts to control Jackson as inappropriate; others support the officer -- 
even his use of obscenities. Toward the end of the conversation, just before 
the officer threatened Jackson with a baton, rough language was appropriate as 
a last-ditch effort to avoid using physical force. Talking doesn't always work, 
but most cops would prefer trying a little verbal intimidation before we start 
swinging the club. When you, the people, took away the chokehold a few years 
ago, words and sticks were about all that you left us for this type of 
situation. There are plenty of seriously injured officers around whose only 
mistake was to let a verbal provocation get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
As for the racism that Jackson, a black man, said he was trying to prove, it 
simply isn't on the tape. Professional officers leave their personal prejudices 
at home. Those who cannot should be retrained, disciplined and fired if nothing 
else works. Not one word that TV viewers heard the officer speak could be 
construed as racial in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Was the officer "brutal"? The footage of the shattered plate glass window was 
undeniably dramatic, shocking and regrettable. Whether the officer shoved 
Jackson too hard is a definite maybe. Whether Jackson intentionally broke the 
window with his right elbow for the benefit of NBC's cameras probably cannot be 
proved. I submit that the officer (who received six stitches in his hand) was 
as shocked as the rest of us when the glass broke. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: During the 35-second verbal exchange the officer made 12 
different statements in his effort to get Jackson to submit to a lawful search. 
The officer finally raised his baton (but at no time used it), and Jackson 
finally put his hands on his head. Twelve verbal attempts is a lot of effort to 
control a recalcitrant, belligerent, unsearched man who intentionally placed 
the officer at a tactical disadvantage in the middle of the night on a Long 
Beach street. The Long Beach city attorney should file a charge against Jackson 
under Section 148 of the Penal Code -- a misdemeanor known as "interfering with 
or delaying an officer in the performance of his duties." 
</P>
<P>
As for the loud "thump" and moans and groans as the officer pushed Jackson down 
on the car hood, the videotape is not very helpful in arriving at a conclusion. 
Was it an act of vengeance by the officer because his hand got badly cut? Was 
Jackson still passively resisting the officer, thus requiring a shove? Or was 
Jackson just play-acting for NBC? These aspects will be examined by many 
investigations over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, that Jackson must be one tough fellow. All that "brutality" and 
wailing and moaning, and still not a mark on him. Try putting your head through 
a plate-glass window, and then smashing your head face-first into the hood of a 
car. Then go look in the mirror. They say that the camera never blinks. Neither 
is it always in a position to adequately document what human beings must later 
interpret. Things like police brutality. And probable cause to stop a car. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's publicity stunts would not work if the press had not anointed him as 
a "media darling" about a year ago when he had some guys dress up like gang 
members. They walked in a wolf pack near the scene of an unsolved gang murder 
of an innocent woman to see if the cops would stop them. Brilliant. As the 
Hawthorne police chief said the other night, Jackson has proved that if you go 
looking for trouble you'll probably find some. 
</P>
<P>
If the independent investigations that are being done by the district attorney 
and the FBI show that the officer's actions were brutal or racist, the system 
will eat him alive and then spit him out. If he was overreacting to Jackson's 
set-up confrontation, he'll be disciplined and counseled and watched. If his 
actions are found to have been mainly reasonable, he'll still have to live with 
the damage that NBC has done to him while chasing an Emmy.

VIOLENCE IS THE BEST-KEPT POLICE SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL A. WATSON, Carol A. Watson, a lawyer, chairs the board of directors of 
the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Widespread media coverage of the recent encounter between Don Jackson of the 
Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service and Long Beach police officer Mark 
Dickey has resulted in public awareness of a serious problem involving 
law-enforcement practices. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the sting and its coverage by NBC complain that it is unfair to 
"ambush" an officer with a TV camera. Our organization maintains that the sting 
was a legitimate means of documenting a problem that many people do not want to 
believe exists. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics say that Jackson "pushed the officer's buttons" by getting out of 
the car and by being "sassy." Although officers should be alert for danger at 
all times, including during traffic stops, they should also be aware that there 
are countless totally innocent reasons why a passenger might get out of a car 
that has been stopped. It is simply not true that people are taught to stay in 
the car, and every officer knows that there is no law requiring them to do so. 
A well-trained officer should be able to retain his composure when confronted 
with nothing more than a person getting out of a car during a traffic stop and 
asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also know that the law specifically permits individuals to question, 
or even curse, representatives of the government. This is the United States, 
not South Africa, and the First Amendment to the Constitution expressly 
provides for freedom of speech -- whether the speech is directed at a 
President, a governor, a postal employee or a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that if Officer Dickey had intended to behave professionally, he 
would have resolved the matter without verbal abuse or physical violence. His 
conduct cannot be justified by the "button-pushing" argument; if his buttons 
are that sensitive, he is unfit for patrol work. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the fact that most police officers do a difficult job well, Don 
Jackson -- an officer himself -- was correct when he said that the incident was 
"consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force." The videotape is but 
one piece of evidence that there is indeed a pattern of violence in Southern 
California law enforcement, and that in the overwhelming majority of cases the 
victims are black or Latino. Evidence of the pattern is also found in 
videotapes of Torrance officers choking and beating a young white man, of San 
Bernardino officers beating Latino men, and in the violence visited on black 
undercover officers by other LAPD officers, and on Ken Maddox, a former aide to 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Several police departments have requested copies of the Torrance videotape in 
order to train their officers in how not to behave. But when police, confronted 
by public criticism, attempt to justify their use of violence, they only 
perpetuate it and undermine the professional standards that most 
law-enforcement officers observe. 
</P>
<P>
Racism and abuse of power were the salient features of Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates' gang sweeps, in which 90% of the several thousand young black 
and Latino men arrested had committed no crime. Then there is the Dalton Street 
incident of last August, probably the most publicized of the many instances of 
gratuitous violence by police in conducting residential searches. (Reportedly, 
18 LAPD officers face disciplinary proceedings for the destruction of the 
Dalton Street residences and the personal property of four black families.) 
</P>
<P>
The foregoing cases are the most notorious, but the pattern of violence also is 
reflected in the large volume of calls to the Police Misconduct Lawyers 
Referral Service. Slightly more than 200 were received in December, requesting 
legal assistance in matters ranging from verbal abuse by police to false arrest 
to physical violence and death. While not all of the calls turn out to involve 
police conduct that was improper, a frightening number do -- so many that the 
service is unable to find enough lawyers to share the caseload. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons for the violence is the failure of government institutions to 
investigate the problem, to compile and disclose the evidence and to state 
unambiguously that unnecessary violence is unprofessional and intolerable. 
Sharing in the responsibility are sheriffs and police chiefs who do not enforce 
regulations, prosecutors who are reluctant to prosecute police, local 
governments that are too timorous to exercise oversight, the state Legislature, 
which passed laws shielding complaints against police from public scrutiny, and 
courts that show extraordinary leniency in sentencing officers convicted of 
using excessive force and in granting them relief from discipline imposed by 
responsible tribunals. 
</P>
<P>
If, as some suggest, Don Jackson was provocative, it was only in provoking a 
public debate on an issue that has been ignored in most communities. Having now 
been exposed to what is virtually a daily event in minority neighborhoods in 
Southern California, the public should turn to local governments to correct the 
problem -- and should be as sassy as necessary.

THE FED AND TIGHT MONEY: A MISGUIDED STRATEGY AT JUST THE WRONG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KUTTNER, Robert Kuttner is the economics correspondent of the New 
Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is the Federal Reserve Board about to sandbag the economy again? 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan offered unusually candid congressional 
testimony, saying that the Fed considers the U.S. inflation rate (about 4.5%) 
unacceptably high, and that inflation "must be brought down." 
</P>
<P>
That declaration gladdened hearts all along Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average up 38 points. Greenspan's statement was widely interpreted 
as a signal that the Federal Reserve would tighten its monetary policy, further 
raising interest rates and slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1987 interest rates have already been nudged up about two full 
points. The policy of tighter money is already reflected in higher interest 
costs on home mortgages, auto loans and commercial credit. All this dampens 
economic activity, which is the Fed's intention. 
</P>
<P>
It is not at all clear, however, that this policy is warranted or wise. There 
is good historical evidence that most of the economic recoveries of the postwar 
period did not die a natural death of old age, but were strangled by tight 
money when the Federal Reserve got prematurely nervous about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation got genuinely out of hand on two occasions -- during the Vietnam War, 
when Congress tried to have both guns and butter, and in the 1970s, thanks to 
OPEC, food shortages and an entrenched spiral of escalating prices and wages. 
</P>
<P>
But the economy of the 1980s is structurally less prone to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
First, trade unions are far weaker than a decade ago. In most industries, 
despite tight labor markets, collective bargaining is mainly about givebacks, 
not about wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
Second, new international competition makes it much harder for industry to 
respond to tight capacity by raising prices. There really is no longer any such 
thing as tight capacity in the traditional sense. If American autos, steel, 
textiles or whatever are in short supply, there are plenty of imported 
substitutes, and firms don't dare jack up prices lest they lose customers. 
</P>
<P>
That is why we have been able to enjoy several years of relatively low 
unemployment, moderate economic growth and low inflation, despite a high 
federal deficit. Moreover, the willingness of foreigners to buy American debt 
means that the old fear that public debt will "crowd out" private capital is 
also less of a worry. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation has crept up, from a low of about 2.5% to 4.5%, not mainly because of 
rising labor costs or tight plant capacity but because of the cheap dollar. 
With the economy more reliant on imports, those foreign goods become more 
expensive for Americans to purchase as the dollar is devalued. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed's traditional remedy of tight money won't do anything to make 
Volkswagens or Sonys cheaper to buy. It will only slow U.S. economic growth, 
make houses more costly to finance and throw more Americans out of work. By 
raising interest rates, it also transfers wealth from borrowers (most of us) to 
creditors (who tend to be wealthy). 
</P>
<P>
The current 5.3% unemployment rate is certainly better than the 11% 
unemployment rate at the pit of the 1982-83 recession, but it is nowhere near 
full employment. About 7 million Americans are still out of work. Despite 
"tight labor markets" in some regions, millions of people are still working for 
wages too low to maintain a decent standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to a tight-money policy is to recognize that today's mild 
inflation has different structural causes, and to design appropriate remedies. 
We should stop trying to become competitive by cheapening the value of the 
dollar, which really is inflationary. Instead, we should begin to pursue more 
aggressive industrial and trade strategies to expand export markets for 
American goods. 
</P>
<P>
Full employment need not be inflationary, so long as there is a kind of social 
compact between industry and labor. Nations as diverse as Japan, West Germany 
and Sweden have enjoyed long periods of low inflation and full employment by 
making sure that wage increases do not exceed productivity improvements, by 
using training programs to anticipate bottlenecks and by giving workers a 
greater stake in the fruits of enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
And we should reclaim the antitrust laws, which gathered dust during the Reagan 
Administration, and use antitrust enforcement to make sure that companies do 
not unfairly rig prices. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a recession today is far riskier than usual, because of the 
large federal deficit. With an already excessive deficit, fiscal stimulus is 
not available as a tool to induce a recovery. Setting off a slump would widen 
the deficit because tax receipts would drop, unemployment compensation pay-outs 
would rise and, thanks to the tight-money policy, the government would have to 
finance its deficit at higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
It is never a good time to artificially induce a recession. But this is a 
particularly bad time.

CHICKEN SOUP AD DECEPTIVE, U.S. CONTENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN J. COUTURIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday accused Campbell Soup Co. of deceptive 
advertising for claiming that the firm's Chicken Noodle soup may help reduce 
the risk of heart disease without disclosing its salt content. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC administrative complaint said Campbell's advertisement, which appeared 
in national magazines last winter, failed to disclose that its soups contain 
high levels of sodium, which may contribute to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The company's failure to make this disclosure is deceptive," the regulatory 
agency alleged. "Campbell did not have substantiation for its claims, and the 
representation that it did is false." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell officials deny that the ad was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit 
consumer advocacy group that in February sought the FTC investigation, was 
pleased with the finding, but said the FTC should have taken even stronger 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC is seeking an order from an administrative law judge that would require 
Campbell, in ads that mention heart disease, to disclose sodium content for any 
soups with more than 500 milligrams in each 8-ounce serving. Campbell's Chicken 
Noodle soup, the soup in the disputed advertisement, contains 910 milligrams of 
sodium in an 8-ounce serving, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other States Investigate 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement -- part of the firm's "Soup is Good Food" campaign -- said 
Chicken Noodle soup contains low levels of fat and cholesterol and that a "diet 
low in fat and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of some forms of heart 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
"Health-related information is very important to consumers, therefore we want 
that information (to be) accurate," said FTC spokeswoman Susan B. Ticknor. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC complaint coincides with an investigation of the advertisement by 
California and seven other states. A decision on whether California will file 
suit against Campbell is expected in the next several weeks, according to 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Albert N. Shelden. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC may also ask the judge to order Campbell not to advertise that its 
products may reduce the risk of heart disease without substantiation. Campbell 
could be fined $10,000 for every violation of the judge's order, Ticknor said. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC cannot seek fines for advertisements that have already run, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell spokesman James H. Moran said executives at the company's headquarters 
in Camden, N.J., have not seen the complaint but believe that the ads are not 
misleading and say they will contest the commission's complaint. "We stand 
behind the ad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell ran the two-page advertisement in magazines from October, 1987, to 
February, 1988. The discontinuation of the ads had nothing to do with the FTC 
investigation, Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Campbell, which controls about 66% of the country's annual $2.3-billion 
soup market, did not mislead consumers because the salt content is on every can 
of the firm's soups. "It's not that we don't tell the public sodium levels," he 
said. "We give them the information."

Experts from six OPEC nations and seven independent oil producers agreed 
Thursday to recommend further steps for bolstering world oil prices, but 
stopped short of making specific plans for cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers from both sides will meet at a yet-undecided date for further 
discussion on the issue, OPEC Secretary General Subroto told reporters after 
the daylong closed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The non-OPEC countries also stated in a communique that they supported OPEC's 
goal of achieving a target price of $18 a barrel "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance improvements already 
achieved and to further strengthen the oil market, especially in the second 
quarter of 1989," the communique read. 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying to enlist the 
support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreed at its November 
ministerial meeting to curtail its own production in order to boost prices.

Allegheny International Inc. filed a revised reorganization plan, saying it may 
sell its flagship Oster and Sunbeam home appliance divisions to help bring the 
company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Pittsburgh consumer products concern 
said it has signed a letter of intent to sell the Milwaukee-based appliance 
unit, as previously disclosed, for $260 million to Black &amp; Decker Corp., a 
maker of household appliances based in Towson, Md. But Allegheny International 
did not say how the rest of its estimated $700-million debt would be paid. The 
plan would leave the company in the possession of its own stockholders.

SAN DIEGO EARNINGS: GREAT AMERICAN REPORTS PROFIT OF $20.1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Kraul 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to a non-recurring $77.7-million gain on the sale of investment 
securities, Great American First Savings Bank reported a $20.1-million profit 
for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from its $13.1-million profit for the 
same quarter in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The gain, made on the sale of Great American's remaining Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) shares, helped counterbalance a $72-million 
provision for probable loan and interest losses, a charge on earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Great American also sold the balance of its Freddie Mac stock in the third 
quarter and the gain of $17.5 million enabled the S&amp;L to show a profit then 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The large loan-loss provision is part of Great American's continuing effort to 
bring its problem loans under control. The provision reduces the S&amp;L's 
non-performing loans to $382 million as of Dec. 31, or 2.4% of $16.1 billion in 
assets. That's a considerable improvement from March, 1988, when bad loans 
totaled $556 million, or nearly 3.7% of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Krzeminski, chief financial officer, said Great American hopes to reduce 
its bad loans to 2% of assets by the end of 1989. The S&amp;L has attributed 
much of its loan problems to the overbuilt Phoenix real estate market. Great 
American inherited a significant loan portfolio there in 1986 when it acquired 
Great American/Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Great American reported a profit of $50.3 million, down from 
$88.1 million in fiscal 1987. The lower fiscal-year profit came despite gains 
totaling $96 million on investment transactions, including the sale of Freddie 
Mac stock, contrasted with gains of $59 million in fiscal 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts generally praised Great American's reduced bad-loan portfolio 
as well as its timing of the Freddie Mac stock sale, several expressed 
reservations about Great American's "core earnings," or money made from its 
lending activities. Those earnings are now being dragged down, they said, by 
Great American's sale in recent years of high-quality packaged loans to boost 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's interest-rate "spread," or the difference between its cost of 
funds and money earned from lending activity figured as a percentage of assets, 
was 1.97% for all of 1988. That's significantly below the 2.55% interest spread 
at H. F. Ahmanson, parent company of Home Savings, the 2.7% spread at Home 
Federal Savings and the "close to 2.85%" spread at Great Western Savings, said 
Gary Gordon, a securities analyst with Paine Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Their core earnings didn't deteriorate, but they did not improve," Gordon 
said. "They have a lot of loans not earning interest and, over the last few 
years, they have been generating lots of earnings by selling their best loans. 
Those aren't around making earnings," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Wall Street analyst who follows Great American and who asked not to be 
named said Great American's low spread is worrisome because, if interest rates 
go up as the analyst expects in 1989, the S&amp;L will find it harder to 
compensate for a squeezed interest spread with further gains on sale of loans 
and securities. 
</P>
<P>
Krzeminski said Great American was slower than other S&amp;Ls in converting its 
portfolio from predominantly fixed-rate loans to those with variable interest 
rates indexed to its cost of funds. Last year, however, 94% of all Great 
American's loans carried adjustable interest rates, Krzeminski said. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's fourth-quarter earnings were also boosted by $17 million in 
gains from real estate investments, contrasted with a loss of $7 million in the 
comparable quarter the previous year. Chris Kraul

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: KNOW VALUE BEFORE YOU SELL COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Applegate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years in the construction equipment business, Byron Romig 
thought he wanted to sell his company. So three years ago, he paid an $18,500 
fee to a firm to value his business and try to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants interviewed employees, reviewed his financial statements and 
produced a 50-page report on Anaheim-based Bymac Inc. Based on market research, 
they suggested he set the price at $3.4 million. Although he felt the research 
was somewhat superficial, Romig agreed to solicit offers. 
</P>
<P>
"A small businessman has very few yardsticks to measure his business by," said 
Romig, who once worked as a business broker himself. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't plan to sell your business, it is important to know how to 
fix a value on it. Figuring out what your business is worth requires a good 
deal of digging, but experts say that the process will help you plan for growth 
in the short term and a possible sale in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"A valuation can be used for estate planning, to borrow money, to set up an 
employee stock ownership plan, or if you think you might want to merge," said 
Romig, who eventually decided not to sell his business and is now seeking 
acquisitions with the hope of growing and going public. 
</P>
<P>
Before calling in expensive consultants, Romig recommends that a small-business 
owner first figure out what he thinks his company is worth. 
</P>
<P>
A value can be calculated by reviewing past and present company financial 
statements, reading industry reports and studying public information about 
competitors. The value of equipment and supplies can be determined by 
monitoring price lists and seeing how much used equipment sells for at 
auctions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While a do-it-yourself approach may work in a specialized field such as the 
selling and leasing of construction cranes and elevators, financial advisers 
caution small-business owners against selling without some kind of professional 
guidance. They say there are too many variables, including the emotional 
attachment to a business built from scratch by an entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when a company is teetering on the brink of insolvency, the owner thinks, 
'It's my company and it has value,' " said Edmond Freiermuth, a Santa Monica 
financial consultant who specializes in rescuing troubled companies. Freiermuth 
said he is "constantly amazed at the difference in the value placed on a 
business by the owner" compared to an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, small-business owners only consider selling when times are 
tough, but Freiermuth said even the most content owner "can be persuaded to 
sell if someone makes them an incredibly good offer." 
</P>
<P>
So what if you decide that 1989 is the time to sell the business you have 
lovingly nurtured from its inception? 
</P>
<P>
"The first rule of thumb in appraising the value of a privately held company 
is: Don't use rules of thumb," said John Johansen, an Arlington, Va., business 
broker. "Each business has its own way of operating." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article in In Business magazine, Johansen suggests looking at four 
important factors when attempting to value your business: 
</P>
<P>
1) Historical profits and future profit potential. 
</P>
<P>
2) General condition of the company, including facilities, staff, record 
keeping, etc. 
</P>
<P>
3) Market demand and economic demand for the particular type of business. 
</P>
<P>
4) Ability to transfer the business's good will to a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners can also find a wealth of practical information in a new 
book co-authored by Lisa Berger, a Washington, D.C., journalist. 
</P>
<P>
In "Cashing In, Getting the Most When You Sell Your Business," published by 
Warner Books, Berger suggests "sprucing up" your business long before you talk 
to a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Get your financials and your building in shape," said Berger. "Start holding 
on to some of your earnings rather than paying for salaries or perks." 
</P>
<P>
She said a marginally profitable small business operated mainly to provide its 
owner with a nice life style will not appear attractive to an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
Although the book provides a glossary of terms, excellent tips on negotiating 
and sample contracts, Berger strongly recommends hiring professional help. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't try to do it by yourself," she said. "Some business owners are not very 
good negotiators." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to sell a publicly held business, there are strict state and 
federal requirements, such as providing fair value to shareholders. But setting 
the actual price may be easier. Daily stock market quotes provide some 
reflection of the market's perception of what the company is worth, according 
to James M. Needham and K. Dunlop Scott, accountants working for Arthur Young 
International. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult steps for some sellers is actually putting the 
company on the market," they write in their booklet, "M&amp;A Strategies." 
</P>
<P>
"You must be bold enough to seize real opportunities to sell your business, yet 
cautious enough so as not to make your company appear to be shopworn or damaged 
merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
Every seller needs a report or "selling memorandum" outlining what his business 
is about and what it is worth. Needham and Scott recommend that the memorandum 
include a confidentiality clause. Such a clause seeks written assurance from a 
potential buyer that any information he learns about your business will not be 
used to your company's detriment. 
</P>
<P>
They also suggest keeping a low profile during negotiations to minimize anxiety 
among suppliers, customers and employees. "A good rule of thumb is to announce 
the sale of the company only after it is completed," Needham said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starting at Home 
</P>
<P>
"How to Start and Promote a Home-Based Business" is the subject of a Feb. 4 
seminar at the College of the Canyons in Valencia. The course is taught by Beth 
Smith, publisher of "Business Line," a newsletter devoted to home-based 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The cost is $28 for tuition, plus a $5 materials fee. Pre-registration is 
required. For information contact: College of the Canyons, 26455 N. Rockwell 
Canyon Road, Valencia. Phone: (805) 259-7800, ext. 421. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

FILLING OF ATWOOD'S POST IS DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION MAY MIRE GM HUGHES ELECTRONICS RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

General Motors said Thursday that it will not immediately replace Donald J. 
Atwood, the president of GM Hughes Electronics who was nominated by President 
Bush this week to be deputy secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood still must be confirmed in his new job by the Senate, but the 
announcement of his departure from GM is expected to create a potentially 
troublesome vacuum at GM's Hughes Aircraft unit in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is in the midst of a major strategic reassessment to cope with changes 
in its military markets. It has been a high-cost producer in an era of 
increasing competition and is trying to lower those costs. A major executive 
change now could complicate its restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hughes insiders credit Atwood, who is the third-highest-ranking GM 
executive, for the relatively benign management that GM has exercised over 
Hughes since the auto maker acquired the aerospace firm in 1985. Atwood is 
president of the GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary that includes both Hughes 
Aircraft and Delco Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood's engineering background and his academic credentials from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology won him acceptance by the Hughes 
technical staff. Under Atwood, company veteran Malcolm Currie was named 
chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft last May. 
</P>
<P>
Currie came into the top job amid substantial turmoil in the executive ranks. 
Former Chairman Albert Wheelon and Richard Alden, former vice chairman and 
general counsel, had both abruptly left the company after a power struggle that 
some Hughes insiders view as a contest between the technical and non-technical 
factions of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Wheelon, a physicist from MIT, had reportedly encountered a lot of opposition 
in his job from corporate staff members who did not have technical backgrounds. 
Ultimately, Alden told GM that he could no longer work with Wheelon, and a 
furor ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood's selection of Currie last May to take over Hughes quelled the turmoil 
and reassured the Hughes technical staff that GM did not intend to remold 
traditionally free-wheeling Hughes in the GM image. Currie, a doctorate 
engineer who trained at UC Berkeley, was a veteran Hughes executive with a 
notable record of scientific achievement. 
</P>
<P>
With Atwood gone, it is not clear how Hughes will fare within the huge GM 
bureaucracy. The company faces some difficulties with falling defense budgets 
and a need to improve its competitive position by cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
If, as some Hughes executives expect, Currie is selected by GM to replace 
Atwood as head of GM Hughes Electronics, it would reopen a competition for the 
top job at Hughes. Another possibility, some said, is that Currie would remain 
chairman of Hughes Aircraft while also taking on the presidency of GM Hughes 
Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft President Donald White is said to be seeking the company's 
chairmanship. He did not respond to an inquiry Thursday.

Robert Blattner, president of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video since 1983, has 
been named president of MCA Inc.'s home video division. He replaces Eugene F. 
Giaquinto, who was placed on a leave of absence last month following news 
reports that the FBI suspects him of funneling company money to a reputed East 
Coast Mafia boss. 
</P>
<P>
The company's announcement Thursday did not mention Giaquinto. Harold M. Haas, 
MCA vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, said Giaquinto 
remains on a paid leave of absence. He noted that Blattner will not assume the 
pay-television part of Giaquinto's prior duties as head of the home video 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Jay Sheinberg, MCA president and chief operating officer, had announced 
Dec. 15 that Giaquinto had "been placed on a leave of absence and relieved of 
all MCA responsibilities, pending further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Blattner had been vice president and general manager of the RCA/Columbia entity 
since 1982 and previously had held the same titles at Columbia Pictures home 
entertainment division since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
W. Patrick Campbell, meanwhile, has been named president of RCA/Columbia 
Pictures Worldwide Home Video. He will remain headquartered in New York. AL

Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s second-quarter earnings jumped 25% to $325 million. 
Worldwide sales rose 9% to $5.3 billion. The Cincinnati-based consumer products 
giant said higher selling prices and greater unit volume contributed to the 
increase.

'E.T.' PUTS MCA'S PROFITS INTO ORBIT IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Recording a bonanza from the release of its "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" 
videocassette in late October, entertainment goliath MCA announced a record 
fourth-quarter profit of $75.7 million on Thursday, more than triple the $21.8 
million earned in the same period in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarter, also bolstered by successful box-office results in the 
Christmas movie season, enabled MCA to complete 1988 with $164.9-million net 
income for the year. MCA's total 1987 profit of $137.3 million had been pulled 
down by problems in its toy business. 
</P>
<P>
MCA declined to pinpoint its revenue or profit from "E.T." home video sales. 
However, fourth-quarter revenue gave a vivid glimpse into its effect: A leap to 
$268.4 million in sales for home video and pay television operations from $72 
million in the corresponding 1987 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Total MCA fourth-quarter revenue was $962.1 million, compared to $674.4 million 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "E.T." cassette sales, MCA's fourth-quarter results included big 
receipts from two theatrical film releases in the holiday period, "Twins" and 
"The Land Before Time." These contrasted with some movie writeoffs earlier in 
1988, including those on "The Milagro Beanfield War" in the first quarter and 
"Moon Over Parador." 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, MCA had record revenue of $3.02 billion, compared to $2.59 
billion in 1987. Operating revenue for 1988 totaled a record $337.6 million, 
compared to $228.4 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Toy operations remained a drag in 1988, with an operating loss of $21.6 
million, mostly on a second-quarter writedown on Gotcha! guns, which shoot 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
However, MCA's music entertainment and book publishing operations each had 
record revenue and operating income in 1988. Revenue increased for the firm's 
new broadcasting and cable segment, which now includes results of WWOR-TV in 
the New York area and equity earnings from MCA's 50% interest in USA Network. 
</P>
<P>
The company's share of fourth-quarter earnings of an affiliate, Cineplex Odeon 
Corp., were omitted from 1988 totals. MCA, which owns about 49% of the 
Canada-based theater operator, said that because of the normal delay in release 
of Cineplex earnings, there will be a one-quarter delay in MCA's reporting of 
its Cineplex profit share. Previously it used estimates furnished by Cineplex.

Nynex Corp.'s 1988 net income increased 3% to $1.32 billion on operating 
revenue of $12.7 billion, up 5%. Fourth-quarter earnings rose 6% to $342.2 
million on operating revenue of $3.2 billion, up 3% compared to the year-ago 
period. Officials of the White Plains, N.Y.-based telecommunications company 
said the acquisition of AGS Computers and an increase in the number of digital 
lines in service contributed to the results.

rose to $903.4 million, up 34%. The Los Angeles-based firm, which is the 
largest single-family home builder in California and third-largest in France, 
attributed its sixth consecutive earnings record to continued strength in its 
regional home building markets in California and France as well as the 
successful performance in commercial development in France.

Tiger International Inc.'s 1988 profit jumped 55% to $89.5 million on an 
increase in revenue of 10% to $1.36 billion. The Los Angeles company, parent of 
cargo carrier Flying Tiger Line Inc., credited results to its global marketing 
strategy and lower fuel costs, which were partially offset by higher 
commissions on eastbound Asia traffic, higher maintenance expense and a 
fourth-quarter charge associated with yen refinancing.

JURORS GET CRASH COURSE IN SHADY TRANSACTIONS USED IN SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL BEGINS FOR 2 CHARGED WITH BANK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM K. KNOEDELSEDER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of two men charged in a $25-million bank fraud began in U.S. District 
Court Thursday, with the prosecutor using an elaborate set of color-coded 
charts in an attempt to explain the complex financial transactions to the 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Leon Weidman portrayed defendants Kimball Dean Richards 
and Thomas E. Curnow as two of the architects of a scheme that victimized 15 
financial institutions -- including such blue chip lenders as Great Western 
Financial, General Electric and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance. The 
financial institutions were sold leases on recording equipment that for the 
most part didn't exist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While not denying what happened, attorneys for the defendants said their 
clients are not to blame. Defense attorney Harlan Braun told the jury that his 
client Richards "did not have the sophistication, background or intelligence to 
pull this bank fraud off." 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, prosecutor Weidman said that between 1982 and 1987, 
Richards gave prospective lenders phony financial statements and tax returns 
for a string of entertainment firms he operated called the Consolidated Allied 
Cos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100,000 Annual Salary 
</P>
<P>
The statements indicated that Consolidated Allied had annual earnings of more 
than $5 million and held more than $10 million in cash in an entity called the 
Motion Picture Workers Credit Union, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those financial statements, he said, prompted the financial institutions to 
provide financing for equipment that Consolidated supposedly purchased through 
Curnow's company, T-C Audio, and a Huntington-Beach-based commercial finance 
firm called Riviera Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, Weidman said, Consolidated Allied was "a total fraud" with no 
income or cash, and the credit union was "nothing more than a button on a 
phone" in Consolidated Allied's Santa Fe Springs offices. Curnow was paid 
$100,000 a year merely to provide Consolidated Allied with false invoices for 
the non-existent equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the fraud was discovered in early 1987, the lenders had provided 
more than $23 million in financing for less than $3 million worth of equipment, 
and Consolidated Allied's lease payments were running about $1 million a month, 
according to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Richards' attorney Braun pointed the finger at 
someone who is not on trial. Braun blamed the problems on Riviera Capital 
President Robert Bernfeld, who is set to go on trial in April for his part in 
the alleged scheme. Bernfeld has pleaded not guilty and in court documents has 
blamed Richards for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Braun described Richards a "naive, in some ways stupid, flamboyant and glib 
rock promoter" who was "consistently deceived and manipulated" by Bernfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Braun also alleged that the fraud scheme "was an inside job" involving 
employees of the finance companies that provided the money. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't defraud 15 institutions out of $25 million without some banker being 
on the take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud charges are the most recent in a long string of legal and financial 
troubles for the 32-year-old Richards, the son of former state Sen. Richard 
Richards (D-Los Angeles), who died recently of cancer at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Weidman also took note in his presentation of the younger Richards' 
free-spending life style. 
</P>
<P>
During 1984 and 1985, Richards spent large sums of money attempting to create 
an image for his company as a major player in the recording industry. He 
outfitted a state-of-the-art recording studio with a $137,000 Jacuzzi room and 
a shark aquarium. He assembled a fleet of telephone-equipped automobiles -- 
including a Rolls Royce, a Mercedes limousine, a Porsche, a BMW and a $65,000 
Ferrari that was given as a 21st birthday present to the company's principal 
recording artist, Luis Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
Richards traveled all over the world -- staying at the best hotels, eating in 
the best restaurants and riding in chauffeured limousines, often accompanied by 
armed bodyguards and off-duty policemen hired to provide a motorcycle escort. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Weidman said Thursday that it was all paid for with "stolen" money.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court 
asking that American Cablevision of Kansas City, Mo., re-establish its public 
access channel so that the Ku Klux Klan can broadcast a white supremacist 
program called "Klansas City." The City Council eliminated the public access 
station last year rather than broadcast the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan's program. In its place, the cable company established a community access 
channel over which it exercises editorial control. The lawsuit says the 
council's decision was motivated by the desire to suppress the viewpoint of the 
Klan. Councilman John Sharp said the City Council welcomes the suit "because it 
was our intention to set a precedent that could be followed by other cities 
throughout the nation. The issue is whether the city has the right to require 
every cable television subscriber to subsidize the Klan's propaganda." Dick 
Kurtenbach, executive director for the local ACLU chapter, said his 
organization found the Klan's white supremacist ideology abhorrent and believed 
Klan members should be prosecuted if they used a television show to incite 
violence or other criminal activity. However, he said, "our client here is the 
First Amendment. The Klan is only the vehicle."

Karlheinz Stockhausen, the 60-year-old West German composer best known for 
experimenting with electronic music, says he suffers acutely from the noises of 
daily life and loves silence. "Acoustic pollution is worse than any other kind 
of poisonous pollution because people don't know that sound waves immediately 
change their souls -- even sound waves they don't notice." He finds no 
contradiction between his belief that noise harms the soul and his use of radio 
or car engine sounds and feet shuffling in his compositions. "Any sound can 
become music if it is related to other sounds. Music is mainly a relationship 
between sounds rather than an exhibition of sound, but first we need silence in 
which to put an ensemble of sounds." ALEENE MacMINN

Real surfers don't do that. It's got to be some misguided fool." Dale bought 
the white guitar with a rosewood neck at a Los Angeles pawn shop for $200 in 
1955. He gave it to the museum when it opened July 30, and had hoped to use it 
this fall at a concert for the U.S. Air Force at the Berlin Wall in West 
Germany. ALEENE MacMINN

'EVIDENCE' GUILTY OF RETRYING OLD PLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something seems to have gone dead inside "Physical Evidence" (citywide). It's a 
cold, bright, thick movie without any life or passion. Yet passion, both moral 
and romantic, is its subject. It's a thriller about a lawyer (Theresa Russell) 
defending a brutal ex-cop accused of murder (Burt Reynolds), and the story 
plays up their class and cultural differences, the corrupt society around them, 
the byzantine quirks and crannies of jurisprudence. 
</P>
<P>
How did it go so flat and empty? Director Michael Crichton and writer Bill 
Phillips seem to be frantically recycling bits and scraps of every recent 
upscale thriller-romance, pushing all the buttons in a doomed attempt to make 
something, anything, light up the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The parts seem interchangeable. There's a sexy lawyer battling battling public 
prejudices in a tangled legal system. (Isn't that "The Accused"?) There are 
backstage finaglings at a sensational trial ("The Verdict," "Suspect"); 
three-cornered romance with undercurrents of murder and obsession ("Fatal 
Attraction"); a disgraced cop trying to clear his name ("Witness"). Phillips 
and Crichton are like a pair who walk into a casino and try to win by playing 
every game in the house. Everything in "Physical Evidence" has an antecedent; 
there's scarcely a moment that seems real or honest. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious influence of all is "Jagged Edge," the 1985 hit by "Evidence" 
producer Martin Ransohoff -- whose son Steve is credited here with part of the 
original story. 
</P>
<P>
Original? 
</P>
<P>
The movie begins with a preposterous set-piece: A hapless would-be suicide 
tries to hang himself from a bridge over Boston Harbor. When he discovers a 
corpse in the girders, the two get tangled up in the rope and fall, dangling 
over water. The scene is staged with such a bouncy rhythm, it's obviously 
intended to tickle and shock. But why would a suicide victim pick a huge, 
well-travelled bridge to hang himself from? Isn't that a bit like like walking 
out on a skyscraper ledge and slitting your wrists? 
</P>
<P>
It's best not to ask questions like that about "Physical Evidence"; you'll 
never stop. Halfway through the trial, lawyer Jenny Hudson calls a witness, a 
gangster's wife (Kay Lenz), who's going to give Reynolds' Joe Paris an alibi, 
by admitting they were together, alone -- until the nasty prosecutor (Ned 
Beatty) brings her murderous gangster husband into the courtroom, intimidating 
her into silence. Did this woman believe her spouse wouldn't find out about her 
confession unless he actually heard it in the courtroom? 
</P>
<P>
So it goes. Michael Crichton is a writer-director whose movies, even at their 
best, seem a little disengaged and remote. They revolve around gimmickry, 
scientific extrapolation, clockwork robberies, robots -- and they're usually 
weak on character. Here, working with a story that's an illogical patchwork of 
other movies, his style seems even more remote; empty of physical beauty, 
though John Alonzo shot it; devoid of humanity, despite a fine cast. Only when 
the movie focuses on its plethora of sleazy villains, a Crichton specialty, 
does it come briefly alive. The sleaze sweepstakes is won, hands down, by 
Angelo Rizacos as a cotton-mouthed contract killer and snitch. 
</P>
<P>
But, even though everything in "Physical Evidence" seems to collapse, star Burt 
Reynolds doesn't. Reynolds has had such bad luck with his projects recently, 
that critics sometimes react as if his movies were high-wire acts. Will he make 
it? Will he fall? 
</P>
<P>
But the emptiness of "Physical Evidence" doesn't muffle Reynolds. He exudes 
dark, glowering authority and plays against his own charm. It's a nice 
performance -- along with Rizacos' Tony Sklar, Larry Reynolds as the trial 
judge and Laurie Paton as a lewd receptionist. It's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' Paris can't save "Physical Evidence" because the movie is built 
around Russell's Jenny: a role that doesn't have the range of her Nicolas Roeg 
films. It leaves her stuck in legal absurdity, erupting in soft-minded yuppie 
spats with her jealous screen roommate Ted McGinley. 
</P>
<P>
"Physical Evidence" is a thriller that doesn't thrill, a romance that doesn't 
ignite, a mystery that doesn't mystify and barely makes sense. Like the corpse 
and the suicide in the movie's opening scene, this movie leaves us dangling 
over dark water, supposedly in Death's embrace but feeling silly.

TWO PERFECT 'PARENTS,' DESPITE THE SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Parents" (citywide) -- Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt make a perfect pair 
of all-American '50s gargoyles: the suburban mom and dad from hell. 
</P>
<P>
They play Nick and Lily Laemle, two Indiana suburbanites whose distraught tot, 
Michael (Bryan Madorsky), watches the murderously sunny facade of his home life 
crumble into bloody madness. The movie crumbles too, into narrative anemia. But 
the surreally ordinary Quaid and Hurt help keep the facade sunny and murderous, 
chirpy and loathsome. 
</P>
<P>
They also keep the lawns clipped, the kitchen sparkling, the dining table 
bounteously heaped with mysterious leftovers. Everything is shiny, shiny . . . 
except at night, when Michael hears sinister chompings and gurglings. 
</P>
<P>
What goes on in the dark? Quaid, immaculately dull, waggling a golf club, has 
the supercilious smirk of a secretly naughty football coach, the menacingly 
modulated charm of "Leave It to Beaver's" Ward with a bloody cleaver. Hurt 
looks a bit like a Celeste Holm-Betty White clone on perky pills. She has stiff 
skirts that flounce and bounce and the stiffer white smiles of a Frigidaire 
saleswoman with a body in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
You don't really need the collection of '50s oldies on the sound track, from 
"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" to "Moments to Remember," to set the 
period. These two actors, plus art director Andris Hausmanis and costume 
designer Arthur Rowsell, nail the '50s to the wall immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, screenwriter Christopher Hawthorne hasn't nailed down anything. 
He's just flung another high-concept dart into space, one more marketing hook 
in search of a movie. The concept has promise. These evilly immaculate parents 
are symbols of the greed and immorality that can lurk beneath a middle-class 
facade, the cancer cells of the Eisenhower era, the rot beneath the frozen 
smile. There's also the shaggy corpse of a psychological drama about troubled 
childhoods buried in here somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The script makes sense only on its own symbolic level; strip away the symbols 
and the story becomes scatterbrained. Why hasn't Michael suspected his parents 
before? Why are they so careless now? Why does the consummate opportunist Nick 
forbid his son to play with the daughter of his boss? Why does Sandy Dennis' 
nosy, blowzy social worker march into the Laemle's home and go prowling around 
upstairs and down? Why is Michael so careless with a telltale stolen 
instrument? 
</P>
<P>
First-time director Bob Balaban gives "Parents" an attractively flashy surface 
and voluptuously askew camera angles; it was Balaban who dreamed up the idea of 
setting it in the late '50s. But "Parents" looks like the work of bright, 
well-intentioned people who've seen a lot of vacuous, predictable horror movies 
and become convinced that they could make a vacuous, predictable horror movie, 
too -- with a sociological point. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappily enough, they've succeeded . . . completely. Those who prefer their 
sociological points without vacuous horror movies attached, may walk out 
famished. "Parents" (MPAA rated R for mature theme and violence) is all 
leftovers, despite the tasty little tidbits that Quaid and Hurt keep 
sporadically cooking up: Dad's spotless collars and loopy grin, Mom's brittle 
Cutex-lacquered claws.

STAGE BEAT : 'SHE'S A WHORE' AT THEATRE ON EDGE; ITCHEY FOOT'S 'NOT LEWIS 
CARROLL'; 'LADY FROM THE SEA' AT FOUNTAIN THEATRE; 'FALSE TEETH' AT EAST WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Tis Pity She's a Whore,' John Ford's Jacobean tragedy of incest, revenge and 
blasted souls, is rarely staged, with good reason. Its excesses are relentless. 
But a new company, Theatre on the Edge, has reshaped the drama into a rock 
musical at the Olio Theatre that is notable for its brash fury. 
</P>
<P>
Director Robert A. Prior's adaptation takes the bloody text by Ford 
(1586-1640), and unleashes it into an orbit full of amusing anachronisms. The 
costumes by Barbara Cox are Renaissance-by-way-of-Frederick's of Hollywood. The 
jaded party scenes and the horrid wedding party suggest "La Dolce Vita." The 
duels and gore are Shakespearean. Twice a dagger sailed off the stage and under 
this reviewer's seat. 
</P>
<P>
The story is about an aristocratic brother and sister (played with a nice 
purity of feeling by Gregg Rainwater and Manjit Kapany) who are passionately in 
love. Events compel the sister to marry a temperamental nobleman (a dashing, 
reckless Dane Christopher), but not before she has already conceived a child 
with her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Subplots spiral, led by Chris Spitler's scabrous, leather-clad bodyguard (and 
the show's outstanding rocker) and Erin Connelly's vicious widow. 
</P>
<P>
The Gothic dynamics of the production are propelled by the alternately 
urgent/dreamy score by composer Andrew Yeater. The percussive music is live, 
electronic and synthesized from Yeater's perch high above the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The result, despite the need to trim more material, is surprisingly raucous and 
viscerally compelling. 
</P>
<P>
An opening 20-minute work, "The Vision of Eros," directed by Erin Connelly, 
transforms 11 of Shakespeare's sonnets into dance imagery, performed by the 
same company. It's superfluous, though, to the evening of lust ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Am Not Lewis Carroll' 
</P>
<P>
A semi-formal evening with the author of "Alice in Wonderland" becomes a 
beguiling adventure at the Itchey Foot Cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Dan Bredemann, with an eagerness and fussiness that is endearing, creates 
a warm and alternately anxious vision of Oxford professor Charles Lutwidge 
Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll). 
</P>
<P>
The one-man show, directed by Alan Weitzman, is a dimensional re-creation of a 
celebrated children's author whom most of us know only as a strange, shy, 
wondrous storyteller with a fixation on pre-pubescent girls. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in material Bredemann based on Dodgson's books and countless personal 
letters, we see the man's vulnerability, his enthrallment with the real-life 
Alice, and catch a glimmer of the wand he waved over the rabbit hole. 
</P>
<P>
A camera on a tripod is a major image. Carroll's photographs of little girls is 
never depicted as anything less than genuine love, and Bredemann's portrayal is 
devoid of any suggestion of pedophilia. When Dodgson delights over a little 
girl's "flounced, buttoned, frilly dress," it's pure as the driven snow. Little 
boys, however, in a revealing flashback, are sticks and stones. The adult 
Dodgson is haunted by a nasty trick played on him in boarding school by cruel 
schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgson, who would often deny he was Lewis Carroll (hence the title "I Am Not 
Lewis Carroll"), is introduced as an inventive young man of 33 cleverly 
entertaining a child in his Oxford study. We see him 14 years later, after his 
success with his "Alice" books, vaguely uncomfortable with the adult world 
while dwelling (at unnecessary length) on his not altogether blissful 
friendship with the famous 19th-Century British actress Ellen Terry. 
</P>
<P>
Bredemann, who looks like Oscar Wilde, at times seems too robust for the role. 
Nevertheless, fragility and eccentricity illuminate the interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Lady From the Sea' 
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional casting in the major female role lights up Henrik Ibsen's 
psychological study of a woman's quest for freedom of choice in the tender "The 
Lady From the Sea" (1888). 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Sakata's Asian Norwegian strongly serves the cause of colorblind casting 
as Sakata impressively dramatizes the quiet determination of a wife drawn to a 
mesmerizing sailor from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Director Meg Kruszewska's production at the Fountain Theatre is polished, 
blending softly the requisite mystery and flecks of humor in a thematic work 
that echoes "A Doll's House" and anticipates Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler." 
</P>
<P>
Set in an upper-middle-class ocean-side retreat, Ibsen's play of feminine Angst 
rings with contemporaneity. The production swerves straight to the issue: When 
the possessive, incredulous husband here -- nicely played by Mark Ringer -- 
finally does release his wife to the stranger from the sea she reclaims her 
integrity and the power and responsibility to choose. 
</P>
<P>
The gawky, invalid suitor is touchingly, lovingly rendered by Sanford Clark. 
Timm Ottman's shadowy sailor, Brynn Baron's older sister, and Patrick Rowe's 
family guest all enjoy texture. And the mood is bolstered by Natasha Beyeler's 
costumes and Ken Booth's lighting scheme. 
</P>
<P>
What seriously flaws the show is the miscasting and the curiously poor 
direction of Kate Asner as the family's younger daughter. She is unremittingly 
screechy and much too teen-age American to be in the least convincing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Laughter and False Teeth' 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Hiroshi Kashiwagi and director Robert Ito spent part of their youths 
interned in Japanese-American relocation camps during World War II. So it is a 
curiosity that "Laughter and False Teeth" at East West Players is a comedy, and 
not a very dark one at that. (It, incidentally, coincides with the resignation 
of Mako as East West's artistic director). 
</P>
<P>
The production is directed with verve, but its failure to touch on racial 
prejudice or even convey a sense of an internment camp blunts its purpose. The 
plot, which depicts people resourcefully overcoming oppression, centers on a 
winsome but toothless madam and the men eager to supply her with false teeth. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy here recalls the internment camp variety show in the 1985 East 
West Players production of "Christmas in Camp II," but without any sense of 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The play was written in 1954 and rarely staged. Some Japanese-Americans have 
been sensitive to its humorous portrayal of camp. 
</P>
<P>
Set against a painted background of mountain peaks, the production features a 
kimono-clad chorus and Brechtian elements mixed with realism. Yoshio Be 
Moriwaki's disconsolate boiler man and Fei-Ru's deranged mother are the only 
characters in the 12-member cast who act like they're incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
The show is stylistically too busy to develop its one provocative theme: a 
conflict between a dentist (Zar Acayan) gung-ho to fight for Uncle Sam and his 
lab assistant Tojo (Ken Katsumoto), fiercely loyal to the Japanese emperor.

NINE PREMIERES IN THIRD 'PIERROT PROJECT' CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The third installment of "The Pierrot Project: Homage to 'Pierrot Luna" 
produced nine new settings of Albert Giraud's Symbolist poems, Wednesday at the 
Arnold Schoenberg Institute. Lucy Shelton and the Da Capo Chamber Players were 
the protagonists on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
The project, brainchild of ASI director Leonard Stein, celebrated the 75th 
anniversary of Schoenberg's 1912 masterpiece by commissioning American 
composers to set the texts from Giraud's cycle not used by Schoenberg, but 
using the same forces employed by Schoenberg. With mild doses of Expressionism 
transformed by the personalities of each composer, the compositions in 
Wednesday's concert, with a couple of exceptions, fell short of a flattering 
showcase of new works honoring the Viennese master. 
</P>
<P>
One of those exceptions, William Kraft's "Mein Bruder," proved mesmerizing with 
an impressionistic canvas of tone colors and delicate use of dissonant chords. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton mastered the deftly wrought Sprechgesang part. The Da Capo Chamber 
Players assisted with careful, sometimes inhibited, attention. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Bassett's frisky waltz "Eine Buhne" maintained a scholarly profile using 
carefully crafted musical ideas, often quoting other works. His "Herbst" 
followed similar footsteps, but in a more somber way. 
</P>
<P>
A violin and piano imitating cricket chirps and cursory use of a 12-tone row 
added little to Ursula Mamlok's "Die Laterne." Paul Cooper's pulsating "Die 
Wolken" and "Sonnen-Ende" also provided fleeting moments of interest. Marc 
Neikrug's symmetrical, unsophisticated "Kopfe! Kopfe!" and Donald Harris' 
routine, academic "Nordpohlfahrt" and "Selbstmord" found even less moments of 
intensity or originality. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after an intermission, a captivating performance of Schoenberg's original 
"Pierrot Lunaire" redeemed the otherwise lackluster evening, easily upstaging 
the newer compositions. Credit goes to Shelton for an exuberant, dramatic 
execution of the Sprechgesang part and, of course, to Schoenberg. GREGG WAGER

KING'S SINGERS AT EL CAMINO: STYLISH, YET THIN TONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vocal virtuosity, stylishness of delivery, abundant slickness and slender, 
slender tone remain the stock in trade of the touring King's Singers, a male 
sextet of English musicians now in their 21st season. Little has changed in the 
group's performances since its first visit here 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At their El Camino College appearance Wednesday night in Marsee Auditorium, the 
six good-looking, personable vocalists repeated some of their past successes 
while introducing new parts of an ever-expanding repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy Ligeti's "Nonsense Madrigals," written for the King's Singers last 
summer and first performed at the Berlin Festival in September, brings together 
felicitously the Hungarian composer's myriad technical complexities and this 
ensemble's many musical accomplishments in an amusing, sometimes awesome, 
display of musical clockworks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, genuine depth seems to elude the composer here; the real resonance in 
these four pieces and 11 minutes comes from the texts by Lewis Carroll and 
others. At the end, one can admire the work without having been touched. 
</P>
<P>
Strong entertainment values also characterized the performances of Robert 
Chilcott's recent "Simple Gifts," a group of five American folk songs arranged 
in a calculated but pleasing way, and of the sextet's familiar Beatles medley, 
which closed the program. Despite recurrent problems of intonational 
consistency, three pieces by William Byrd emerged pristine in style and usually 
comprehensible of text. 
</P>
<P>
Least successful in this varied program was the King's Singers' bland, 
thin-toned and word-weak attempt at five part-songs by Schubert. True 
versatility is an ideal, not always a practical goal. DANIEL CARIAGA

SMOOTH SAILING AT WEST L.A.'S CHINA SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a shortfall, a definite underproduction of Chinese restaurants west of 
the 405. Why should this be? I mean, the closer to the ocean, the closer to the 
Pacific Rim, right? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing but this Santa Monica/West L.A. Chinese restaurant deficit would get me 
to Sawtelle Place, a mall with the approximate architectural charm of a junior 
high school. The China Sea isn't much to look at itself, just a boxy mall-type 
room up a wind-whipped flight of stairs, although it does have a sophisticated 
sheet metal construction over the bar representing a 1930s seaplane coming out 
of some storm clouds. Or possibly it's just a fender from a two-car banger over 
on the 405. 
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure, though, to find that the food is very good. As the name 
suggests, the China Sea has a specialty in seafood, but it also has a long list 
of dim sum available at all times, notably including beautifully fluted pot 
stickers and siu mai and a remarkably fluffy char siu bao ("like a marshmallow 
with roast pork in the middle," as somebody said). 
</P>
<P>
There's an unusual grilled pork sausage, stiff and sweet with deliciously 
melting fat. Among the meat and poultry dishes, you can find chicken "with 
pepper skin," which is chicken cooked to make it look and somehow even taste a 
little like duck. Clearly, this is a seafood restaurant with no prejudice 
against higher-ups on the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Or against vegetables, for that matter. The eight precious vegetables are as 
good as I've ever had, fresh and crisp and a little bit peppery in a very light 
black bean sauce, and included among the eight precious ingredients is the 
elusive and somewhat garbanzo bean-like ginkgo nut. 
</P>
<P>
But the seafood is definitely the center of attention. For instance, shrimp 
with honey-glazed walnuts, in a subtle black bean sauce with water chestnut, 
bell peppers, the walnuts with their sly after-taste of honey, and from time to 
time a tiny sting of ginger. Various seafoods are available in a particularly 
vivid peppery-garlicky black bean sauce. There was a faint odd taste to my 
scallops, as if they'd been over-floured, but I could probably eat straight 
ginkgo nuts without objecting if they were served in this sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The oddest name trophy goes to Fred's Favorite Fried Oysters. (The menu 
explains that Fred is an oyster connoisseur, which is not quite enough 
information for me.) They're very good, plump oysters in a model of light, 
crisp breading, but I'd rather put lemon juice on them, or even the fiery 
mustard that is deceptively served in an American plastic mustard dispenser, 
than the sweet plum sauce that's offered. 
</P>
<P>
One thing I wish is that the China Sea did not go in for the absurd Chinese 
practice of serving crab in the shell with the sauce on the outside. Not only 
is it undignified to lick sweet ginger sauce off a crab shell in public, the 
sauce -- particularly when it's as thickened with cornstarch as this one -- 
makes it all but impossible to handle the crab to crack the shell etc. 
</P>
<P>
But in light of the scarcity of Chinese restaurants on this side of town, I 
believe I can overlook that. Yes, I believe I can. That and the Sawtelle Place 
architecture.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: CAMBODIAN ACCENT

There was only one table occupied at Angkor, 16161 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 
990-8491, last Wednesday night. Which is a shame, because the first Cambodian 
restaurant in the Valley (actually the first I know of outside of Long Beach) 
serves really delicious food in a pleasant atmosphere at reasonable prices. 
And, unusual for a 2-week-old storefront restaurant, they even have a beer and 
wine license. 
</P>
<P>
What should you try? Well, we ordered a veritable feast, and there wasn't a 
single dish I didn't like. A particularly voluptuous soup mingled the flavors 
of coconut, pineapple and chicken; egg rolls were tiny, crisp and delightful; 
shrimp came in an egg and wintermelon sauce; a salad of green papaya, pork and 
prawns had the piquant bite of chile peppers; and fried bananas in a very 
sticky sauce came to the table in flames. This is just a small sampling of the 
food we tried: Five of us ordered more than we could possibly eat, washed it 
down with beer and ended up with a bill totaling $81. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly this interesting new restaurant deserves a few more customers. RUTH

Conceptual altar pieces by Portuguese artist Leonel Moura combine a grainy 
enlargement of a newspaper photo showing skyscrapers or freeway networks and a 
lead bookstall displaying copies of Charles Deleuze's "A Filosofia De Kant." In 
a colored band across the photo, the word "America" is written in computer 
text. As cultural icons, this tough, political art appears to take potshots at 
the soulless material progress of the U.S., just as Moura's earlier work 
attacked repression in Portugal. It's a point of view that sees ironic 
contrasts between Western civilization's love affair with codification and 
standards and its veneration of the individual conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Moura makes this comment by juxtaposing a second-hand image of highly 
organized, bland American architecture with the embalmed structure of Kant's 
philosophy, which held morality to be an inner-guided truth. By setting 
theoretical and inner-directed structures side by side in the same altar, the 
artist captures something of the American moral dilemma. How to contain the 
individual within the society without losing the individuality of the society? 
</P>
<P>
As objects, Moura's icons are as cool and blunt as the evening news. The 
messages may be buried within contexts as dense as philosophy, but there is 
still something about the newsprint imagery with its one-word legend that is 
comfortably familiar. Perhaps that familiarity is due to the way the 
identification mimics the micro-byte-information gathering of this society.

Amy Sabrina's white earthenware teapots and other vessels suffer from terminal 
cuteness. Most of them offer coy catalogues of flora and fauna: fruits, 
flowers, bugs, cats and mutts (heads and hindquarters), painted in demure ovals 
and grids. The lid knobs continue the theme: a sliced watermelon standing on 
one end, a puppy's tale. Cataloguing small or lovable objects might have been a 
wry or tongue-in-cheek endeavor, but in the work of this Minnesota ceramist, it 
reeks of playing to the market. 
</P>
<P>
Carme Collell's table-top earthenware pieces convey the feeling of architecture 
without quite delivering the substance. Curving, slant-edged walls enclose 
hidden pockets of space and sketchy blues and rusts (sometimes with brighter 
colors) hint at archways and shadows and the burnished look of old, weathered 
walls in Collell's native Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The goal seems to be the creation of haunting archetypal structural presences, 
but the results are vaguely attractive, fuzzy generalizations that need either 
more plausible details or a bigger dose of fantasy. (Garth Clark Gallery, 170 
S. La Brea Ave., to Feb. 1.) CATHY CURTIS

Tom Wesselmann is long known for Pop-style comic-book nudes that function as 
takeoffs on our culture's obsession with sex and violence. His constructions 
used clocks, air conditioners and photomontaged cityscapes to evoke the same 
sarcastic urban flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Well, time has mellowed Wesselmann. Unlike the '60s and '70s, it's OK to be a 
lyrical draftsman today, and Wesselmann shows he's just that, in wall-hung, 
contour drawings cut out of very thin sheets of metal. Negative space is 
completely cut away so that the bare white wall functions almost like a drawing 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Vivienne," a big female face with bee-stung lips and bull's eye breasts, is 
closest to the Wesselmann we know. The laser-cut pieces are more atypical. A 
computer directs a laser to cut steel according to Wesselmann's free-hand 
drawings, recording every wisp of the brush and sleight of the hand. Clusters 
of flowers in vases, fruit bowls, an impish remake of a Mondrian grid, and, of 
course, Wesselmann's bevy of ripe odalisques are formed from the lacy, brightly 
painted metal. Though some will find the textbook Wesselmann dated and the new 
one a little too civilized, works have the spontaneous, schooled charm of life 
drawings scrawled on a wall. (BlumHelman, 916 Colorado Ave., to Feb 18.)

Every retrospective of a major artist spawns small, satellite shows hoping (at 
best) to beef up our information or (at worst) to benefit from the media 
fallout. A small, visual footnote to the County Museum of Art's Billy Al 
Bengston retrospective does a little of both. You could argue that after 20 
years of living with the glitzy, never news-shy Bengston, L.A. viewers don't 
need updates. On the other hand, this show treats us to quintessential late 
'60s Billy at his bad-boy-pretty-surface best. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly prints, the show demonstrates that whatever your feelings about 
Bengston's ability to handle paint, he's a deft printmaker. From the late '60s, 
there are violet and lime green chevrons printed on dented aluminum. There are 
also scores of lithographed irises -- coiled in pretty patterns, blanched to 
minimal white on white, reduced to dots and dashes. The real fun comes from 
large, handsome lacquer and resin on aluminum pieces that give Bengston's 
car-culture slickness a touch of the emblematic. (Cirrus, 542 S. Alameda St., 
to Feb. 14.) MARLENA DONOHUE

WALSH OUT, BUT STILL CALLS PLAYS; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS NAME HIS CHOICE, SEIFERT, AS NEW HEAD COACH

Bill Walsh went out a winner Thursday when he resigned as coach of the San 
Francisco 49ers, and his hand-picked choice was named to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh joined Vince Lombardi as the only head coaches to step down after winning 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
He won a power struggle with 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., when the 49ers 
announced that defensive coordinator George Seifert would be the new head 
coach. DeBartolo reportedly had wanted a high-profile coach; Walsh had lobbied 
for Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 57, will stay on with the 49ers as executive vice president for football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to announce the changes, DeBartolo called Walsh "the 
greatest coach ever." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh coached the 49ers to their third Super Bowl championship of the 1980s 
last Sunday, when San Francisco beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls 
(1967-68) and then retired to the Packers' front office. He later returned as 
coach of the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the 49ers' reorganization, General Manager John McVay will take on 
the title of vice president of football administration. But DeBartolo said that 
Walsh will be in charge of the draft, trades and roster cuts. 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo said he didn't try to talk Walsh out of his decision because the 
coach had already made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after what DeBartolo said was an "emotional meeting" 
with Walsh Wednesday in Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It got emotional a little bit because I don't think anybody wants to change 
something that has gone so well and so right for so long," DeBartolo said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he had more or less made up his mind to retire during the season but 
wanted to wait until it ended before making the decision final. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to my new career," Walsh said. "It's been 10 great years . . . 
It was a 31-year (coaching) career, and there's a time for everybody at some 
point to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uplift to me to step aside on a most positive note. This is the way 
most coaches would like to leave the game." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Walsh and DeBartolo have frequently been cool. Last season, 
after the 49ers lost to the Minnesota Vikings in the first round of the 
National Football Conference playoffs after compiling the league's best 
regular-season record, Walsh lost his title as team president. 
</P>
<P>
But DeBartolo denied that there was a serious rift between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, he told reporters: "That's the furthest thing from the 
truth that I could imagine. Bill and I are friends, good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who held the 49ers' coaching position longer than anyone else and is 
only the team's fourth coach with a winning record, strongly endorsed Seifert, 
a 49-year-old San Francisco native, who has been a 49er defensive aide since 
1980 and before that assisted Walsh at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
A report in Thursday's New York Daily News said DeBartolo wanted University of 
Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson to take the 49er job. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who ended his career with an overall record of 102-63-1, including 
playoff games, joined the 49ers in 1979 after 2 seasons as head coach at 
Stanford, where he compiled a 17-7 record and won bowls at the end of both 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"A very lofty standard has been established in this organization by Bill Walsh, 
one I look forward to maintaining," Seifert said. "I believe we can continue to 
produce the type of team that San Francisco will be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
In Walsh's first season, the stumbling 49ers matched their 1978 record of 2-14. 
The next year, they were 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the 49ers, with Joe Montana out of Notre Dame at quarterback, went 
13-3 and defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 26-21, in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In strike-shortened 1982, the 49ers went 3-6. But they bounced back to 10-6 in 
1983 and in 1984 went 15-1, winning their second Super Bowl with a 38-16 
victory over the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
They went 10-6 in 1985, 10-5-1 in 1986 and 13-2 in 1987 -- but seeds of dissent 
between Walsh and DeBartolo were sown when San Francisco lost at the start of 
the playoffs all 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 season looked to be more of the same, and the 49ers at one point were 
just 6-5, embroiled in a quarterback controversy and all but written off for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But Montana returned to form, sending Steve Young to the bench, and the team 
won 4 of its last 5 to go 10-6 in the regular season, then swept aside the 
Vikings and the Chicago Bearsen route to last Sunday's dramatic last-minute 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
That victory was credited in great part to Seifert, who prepared the defense so 
well that Cincinnati's controversial "no-huddle" offense played no part in the 
game. And his shifting zone, which followed Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason 
as he moved, helped keep Cincinnati's top-rated offense from scoring a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Eric Wright said before the Super Bowl that he feared that if Walsh 
quit, the 49ers would hire "a regiment-type coach" instead of a players' coach. 
Asked which kind of coach Seifert would be, Wright hesitated and said, "I know 
one thing: Guys will stay in meetings longer." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh and Seifert followed different paths in their careers. While Walsh had 
varied experience in the pros, including stints as an assistant with the 
Oakland Raiders, Bengals and San Diego Chargers, Seifert's only pro experience 
has been as an assistant to Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh coached at San Jose State, at California and at Stanford before moving to 
the pros; Seifert worked at Utah, was head coach at Westminster College in Salt 
Lake City, assisted at Iowa and Oregon, and was head coach at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Walsh is the one who built this dynasty," running back Roger Craig said. 
"We'll all miss Bill, he's the innovator, turned this whole club into winners. 
But I'm sure he'll still be around."

OLYMPICS TAKE TOLL ON 6 PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BERNUCCA, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The snake-bit U.S. Olympic basketball team is still down on its luck long after 
the Games are over. Six of the 12 members have missed time this season because 
of injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious of these was Danny Manning of the Clippers. The No. 1 pick in 
the NBA draft will be out of the lineup for at least a year with a 
career-threatening knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Also missing time this season have been North Carolina's J.R. Reid with a foot 
fracture; Jeff Grayer of the Milwaukee Bucks with knee problems; Charles Smith 
of the Clippers with two knee injuries; Hersey Hawkins of the Philadelphia 
76ers with knee problems and Phoenix forward Dan Majerle with mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long, disappointing haul for the Olympians. They went right from 
the regular season to Olympic tryouts and practice, to the Games and then back 
into the current regular season. Added to the insult of bringing home the 
bronze instead of the expected gold is the injury of not having had a 
meaningful break from basketball since October of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fatigue problem, I think," said Grayer of the Milwaukee Bucks, a 
guard on the Olympic team who has played just 11 games this season because of 
several injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go straight from your collegiate career and then start training for 
the Olympics and then from there into professional ball, you get tired. It's a 
lot of wear and tear on your body." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone thinks the later-than-usual Olympics -- it ended Oct. 2 -- is the 
cause of the injury rash. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of rookies get hurt and I don't think you can attribute that to playing 
too much or too little," Manning said after his injury. "It's just one of those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
A review of the top 16 picks of the past five drafts shows that 20 players -- 
an average of four per year -- suffered an injury serious enough to keep them 
out of the lineup for more than 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, four Olympians -- Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, Alvin Robertson and 
Leon Wood -- entered the league after winning the gold medal that summer. 
Jordan was the league's top rookie, and none of them suffered a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1984 Summer Games were held in July, much earlier than the 1988 games. 
The 1984 team had a much longer break between medal ceremonies and training 
camp. Olympic coach John Thompson believes that is a factor to the high 
percentage of injured Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Olympics were so late the kids were going from prime competition 
to prime competition," the Georgetown coach said. "It (the injuries) may have 
to do with a lack of time for recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, Manning's teammate on both the Olympic team and the Clippers, 
agrees with his Olympic mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much that we had to play in the Olympics themselves, it's that 
we've been playing a long time without a stop," said Smith, who has injured the 
same knee twice this season, missing 11 games. "The long practice sessions and 
all the traveling we did before the Olympics have taken a toll." 
</P>
<P>
The first Olympian to go down was Hersey Hawkins, who missed the semifinal loss 
against the Soviets and the first week of training camp with a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly we could be tired," said Hawkins, now a guard for the Philadelphia 
76ers. "I think that most of the things that happened were freak accidents." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good at this point," said Hawkins, who has not missed any regular 
season games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel tired. Maybe when I get to 50 or 60 games it will catch up with 
me. There are days I may come to practice and I don't feel like playing. I have 
to fight through it." 
</P>
<P>
While Manning and company have spent part of the season on the injured list, 
two other Olympians -- Golden State's Mitch Richmond and San Antonio's Willie 
Anderson -- are battling for top rookie honors. 
</P>
<P>
"His (Richmond's) late signing turned out to be a blessing in disguise," said 
Golden State assistant coach Garry St. Jean several months ago. "When he 
arrived in camp, you could see he was refreshed." 
</P>
<P>
Ligament and cartilage damage to his left knee has forced Grayer to the Bucks' 
injured list for the third time this season. But Grayer missed training camp 
and the first six games of the season with chicken pox, while another Olympian, 
Phoenix forward Dan Majerle, contracted mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
Majerle may miss the rest of the season with an enlarged spleen and other 
complications resulting from mono. 
</P>
<P>
Bucks medical adviser David Haskell said Majerle's condition might be linked to 
fatigue, although there's no evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a set of circumstances that creates a question," Haskell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the constant wear and tear on the body is showing," Grayer said. When 
I first started here, I didn't feel fatigued. I wasn't tired at all. I felt 
like I was in the best shape of my life. Then all of a sudden, everything hit." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still having physical problems," Smith said. "The two-a-days didn't hurt 
us at the time of the Olympics, but they're hurting me now. I've lost 10 pounds 
since the beginning of the season, and it seems like I'm always getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
The grind, says Hawkins, should come as a surprise to no one. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us knew what we were getting into," he said.

JIM MURRAY: OPERATION REARM WAS BIG WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Which non-player in baseball history made the greatest contribution to the game 
in terms of victories, playoffs, pennants, World Series he was directly 
responsible for, part of by proxy? 
</P>
<P>
Connie Mack? Casey Stengel? No, I'm talking of a man who never wore a major 
league uniform, never managed, never sat in a front office, made a trade, wrote 
out a lineup or hit a fungo. 
</P>
<P>
I almost said, "never changed a pitcher," but that wouldn't be quite accurate. 
He changed a pitcher, all right, and thereby hangs the tale. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1974, Tommy John was the most forlorn athlete you will ever see. 
His team, the Dodgers, were in the World Series, but he wasn't. He moped around 
the fringes, his arm cast in a leather sling, his chin drooping. 
</P>
<P>
That year, he had been off to the best start ever in his career. He had 13 wins 
in 16 starts. He might have been on a Cy Young pace when suddenly his arm 
snapped like an old guitar. The question was not whether he could ever pitch 
with it again, but whether he could ever tie his shoelaces or comb his hair. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen Connie Macks can't do anything about that. Tommy didn't even need an 
agent anymore. Who needs an agent to sell insurance? 
</P>
<P>
What Tommy needed was a miracle. He needed a new arm. Arms are not 
regenerative. They come two-to-a-customer and they're not issued or hinged to 
throw curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy's arm hung down like a broken clock when he went into the orthopedic 
clinic of Drs. Bob Kerlan and Frank Jobe. Most people thought he would be 
better off at Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
The sports world had reason to become used to surgical wonders performed by the 
Kerlan-Jobe complex but they couldn't raise the dead. 
</P>
<P>
And the betting was, Tommy's arm had gone to its last resting place, that great 
bullpen in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball had seen this scenario before. Guys whose arms have no pulse in them 
try everything this side of faith healing to get the fastball back in them, but 
they usually come up 20 m.p.h. short and can't get anybody out any more. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why, by the time Dr. Jobe got through operating, the game felt as if 
Tommy John had gone to a laboratory in Transylvania, not Inglewood, for his 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
And this was really Dr. Frankenstein Jobe who did the work. He didn't operate 
on the arm, he built a new one. It was joked that if you lifted it up to your 
ear, you could hear wolves howl. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose said it best: "I know they had to give Tommy John a new arm. But did 
they have to give him Koufax's?" 
</P>
<P>
Tommy John and his electric arm stunned baseball. He was 33 years old when he 
returned to the game after surgery and a year-and-a-half in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
He had won 124 games up till then. He was to win 162 afterward. 
</P>
<P>
He had never been in a playoff or World Series before his surgery. He was in 
them almost every year thereafter -- six playoffs and three World Series. 
</P>
<P>
John is pitching yet. He will be 46 in May. The venerable Satchel Paige once 
wrote a book, "Maybe I'll Pitch Forever." T.J. could write the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the most extraordinary accomplishment in sports medicine in baseball 
history. Tommy John had never won more than 14 to 16 games a season with his 
old arm. With his new one, he was a 20-game winner three times and he won 80 
games in one 4-year stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The older he got, the younger the arm got. John's favorite routine was to tell 
the press, he was 40, but his arm was only 9 years old and getting smarter by 
the minute. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story to make the scalp prickle. T.J. cannot swat airplanes out of the 
sky with his arm, or stop bullets, or lift oil trucks -- but he can throw 
ground balls with it. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of pitchers coddle their arms. Shake hands with their other hand, keep a 
heat pack (or ice) on it overnight. They care for it the way a frontiersman 
took care of his rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy John treats his as an equal partner. It may outlive him. He may want to 
leave it to someone like a family heirloom. It's probably got a thousand more 
double-play balls left in it and 500 taps back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
It's the most dramatic surgical triumph of Centinela Hospital Medical Center's 
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic, but hardly the only one. 
</P>
<P>
At a seminar at the Sportscasters monthly meeting at Lakeside Country Club 
Thursday, Dr. Jobe was explaining what has happened to sports orthopedists in 
the past decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
"We've improved socially," he announced wryly. "We used to be the bag ladies of 
medicine. The neurosurgeons were at the top of the hierarchy. After all, they 
operated on the brain -- and the brain is where the soul is, right? The 
cosmetic surgeons were the stars. Internists were tolerated. We were the ones 
who put the lights out and locked up. But all that's changing. A neurosurgeon 
even spoke to me in the hall only the other day." 
</P>
<P>
Put in Dr. Kerlan: "When my father was a doctor, if a sports person came to him 
and said, 'My elbow hurts when I hit a tennis ball,' my father would say, 
'Well, then, stop hitting a tennis ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Tommy John came to Dr. Jobe with his arm hanging by one frayed strand of a 
tendon, Dr. Jobe did not tell him, "Stop throwing baseballs." 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Jobe: "I told him, we've never done this (procedure) before. We make no 
guarantees. But Tommy insisted. 'We have to do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
He created an arm that can win 162 games practically by itself. I wonder if he 
can create one that can write columns -- or break 80 -- by itself? 
</P>
<P>
Either way, since Tommy John -- or Dr. Jobe's arm -- won all those games in 
Yankee Stadium, Dr. Jobe should at least be one of those monuments in the 
outfield there. With a slug line for most-games-won by a guy who never hit, 
threw, caught or taught a curveball in his life. 
</P>
<P>
And if he wins 14 more games (for 300), Tommy John may be the only guy to be 
represented at Cooperstown by a disembodied arm.

WILSON, UCLA BEAT COUGARS ON THE REBOUND

<P>
UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick has described the road as mean, ugly and 
nasty. 
</P>
<P>
It got meaner, uglier and nastier Thursday night until Trevor Wilson rebounded 
his own missed shot and scored on a layup with 2 seconds left to give the 
Bruins a 64-63 victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's shot capped a furious rally by the Bruins, who overcame a 10-point 
deficit in the last 5:15 before a crowd of 4,040 at Friel Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I borrow your hair dryer?" Harrick cracked afterward, only a short time 
after Pooh Richardson almost knocked him over with a bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
The game-winning play was an act of desperation, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything I could to get the rebound because I knew Coach was going to 
give me an earful for taking that (first) shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it wasn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
After posting up and taking a pass from Pooh Richardson, Wilson went up for 
about an 8-foot jumper along the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
The shot bounced out, and Wilson took the rebound away from Washington State's 
Brian Quinnett and banked in a shot off the glass. 
</P>
<P>
What could the Cougars have done differently? 
</P>
<P>
"Get the rebound," Coach Kelvin Sampson said tersely. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson had reason to be upset. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State, which lost its previous 3 games by 42, 18 and 27 points, 
controlled this one for 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, and tonight UCLA was lucky," 
Sampson said. "The best team didn't win that game. We deserved to win that 
doggone game, and I think it's a crying shame we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably one of the toughest losses I think I've ever had. I've never 
seen a team that deserved to win more than that." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, jumped the Cougars down the stretch to improve its record to 
11-5, including a 6-2 mark in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State, loser of 6 straight games, is 6-11 and 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are going so bad that Sampson said earlier this week of Sunday's 
game against USC, winless in the Pac-10: "It looks like that game is going to 
be a battle for the cellar." 
</P>
<P>
A 3-point play by Richardson started the UCLA rally, cutting the Bruins' 
deficit to 50-43 with 5:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA continued to whittle away at the Cougar lead, getting a 3-point shot from 
the corner by Kevin Walker with 3:02 left to make it 57-55. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after Washington State's Anthony Kidd missed the first of a 
one-and-one free-throw situation with 1:40 left, UCLA had a chance to tie or go 
ahead for the first time since the opening minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, though, missed a 3-point attempt and Darryl Woods rebounded for the 
Cougars. However, at the other end, Quinnett missed a 3-pointer for WSU, and 
Richardson chased down the rebound in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing fast break, Wilson was fouled by Quinnett with 43 seconds left 
and UCLA trailing, 61-59. 
</P>
<P>
After Wilson made the first free throw and Washington State called time out, 
Harrick moved the 6-foot 10-inch Walker from midcourt, where he normally lines 
up, to a position on the right side of the lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he could get a tip-in," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker didn't get a tip-in, but he grabbed the rebound of Wilson's missed free 
throw, kept the ball aloft and banked in a short jumper to give UCLA a 62-61 
lead with 41 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of poise on that play," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Having squandered a lead that reached 13 points with less than 10 minutes left, 
the Cougars looked to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinnett, who scored 23 points on 11-of-16 shooting, drilled a fall-away 
jumper in the lane with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA set up the game-winning play, on which Wilson, who scored 21 points, was 
the first option. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrick: "When Trevor forgets about all the things that are going on in 
the world and just plays basketball, he becomes a force." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson scored 12 points in the last 6:49, all but taking it upon himself to 
save UCLA from what could have been a devastating loss. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pooh Richardson scored 17 points for UCLA but had a season-high 7 turnovers and 
only 4 assists. In his last 6 games, Richardson has 29 turnovers and 30 
assists. . . . Don MacLean, held scoreless and limited to only 1 shot in the 
first half, scored 11 points. The freshman forward has scored in double figures 
in 11 straight games and 15 of 16. . . . Kevin Walker scored 11 points and 
pulled down 8 rebounds, his highest rebound total in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Darrick Martin hyper-extended his right knee in the second half and 
limped off the court. He returned a short time later but was held without a 
point for the first time this season and didn't attempt a shot in 29 minutes. . 
. . UCLA Coach Jim Harrick: "We just couldn't get anything going, couldn't get 
anything generated. I think that's a credit to them. They were well prepared 
and played very physically and emotionally." . . . UCLA scored a season-low 24 
points in falling behind by 11 at halftime. . . . UCLA will play Washington 
Saturday in Seattle.

CLIPPERS LOOK SHARP BUT FALL APART IN 2ND HALF; 
</P>
<P>
ROCKETS COME BACK TO HANG 13TH STRAIGHT DEFEAT ON LOS ANGELES, 106-100 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only fashionable statement to come out of the Houston Rockets' 106-100 
victory over the Clippers Thursday night at the Summit is that Coach Don Casey 
is having a positive influence on a team stuck in last place in the Pacific 
Division. His own players say it, and so does the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Blackwell, apparently, would disagree. A ranking of the best-dressed 
coaches in the National Basketball Assn. by a USA Today sportswriter put Casey 
in a last-place tie with the Denver Nuggets' Doug Moe, who would have had the 
basement to himself until Casey's elevation from assistant to head coach last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has enough to worry about with a team that has lost 13 straight and 
dropped to 10-30 overall, didn't think the ranking fit. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that (Norm) Nixon and my wife pick out my clothes," Casey said. 
"That's my excuse. Besides, I saw Dave DuPree (the USA Today reporter) at our 
place (the Sports Arena) a while ago, and he looked like he was going to a 
taping of 'Hee-Haw.' He's a fine one to talk." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, the Clippers were quite the rage in the first half, when they 
jumped to a 58-42 lead, due in large part to Casey's most prominent addition to 
the team, a trapping defense. That was the most points the Clippers had scored 
in the first 2 quarters since Dec. 20 against the Warriors in Oakland. It was 
also their biggest halftime lead since Nov. 5 at Miami, their second game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
When Benoit Benjamin opened the third quarter with a 10-foot baseline jumper, 
the lead went to 18 points, 60-42. The Clippers looked nothing like the outfit 
that has been taken to the cleaners so often in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And then they fell apart. Houston, which moved into a first-place tie with the 
Utah Jazz in the Midwest Division, went on a 22-9 run early in the second half 
and finally pulled even, 69-69, on Mike Woodson's layup. The Clippers, trying 
to hold on as their energy faded, soon took a slight lead again, but the 
Rockets came back and took control for good midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We came so close," said Reggie Williams, who had a game-high 26 points, 
including 3 of 5 3-point shots, off the bench. "We've been losing and we wanted 
this one real bad. We outplayed them, but we didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they did not. But few teams would have won after being outscored, 
64-42, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Casey was particularly encouraged by the intensity on the trap, which limited 
the Rockets to 41.4% shooting and Akeem Olajuwon to 20 points, including only 9 
in the first half. Joe Wolf had a season-high 16 points, hitting 8 of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin had 13 rebounds, even if only 3 came in the second half. Nixon, while 
scoring only 4 points, had 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Don Chaney was impressed with the way the Clippers attacked on 
defense. He credited Casey for that. 
</P>
<P>
"He's cut the edge off them," said Chaney, a former Clipper assistant with 
Casey under Jim Lynam and later the head coach, with Casey as the No. 2 man. 
"He gained them some leverage by attacking us with the trap. That was very good 
strategy. Had they been man-to-man, we would have won by 20. But the zone trap 
shut off our game to the big men and made us take outside shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He stayed with the game plan very well. . . . Akeem and Otis (Thorpe) were not 
able to get the ball much, and they gambled that we wouldn't hit our outside 
shots. It worked in the first half, but we did a better job in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the Record: A story in Thursday's editions on Clipper Coach Don Casey 
contained the wrong first name of the coach for whom Casey had worked at Temple 
University. His name was Harry Litwack. . . . Rob Lock played his second game 
for the Clippers, after having been released from his contract from Reggio 
Calabria in the Italian pro league. A third-round draft pick from the 
University of Kentucky, Lock originally bypassed the Clippers because they 
wouldn't sign him to a guaranteed contract, while the Italian pro league gave 
him that, a rent-free apartment, two cars to use and other perks. Basically, 
everything was paid for except gas and food, and the latter was often taken 
care of when he ate with the team. Still, Lock said he won't miss it. "We were 
in the southern part of Italy, where very few people spoke English," he said. 
"At first, it was great. But when I was over there for Christmas and then when 
I had been over for 5 months, I'd had enough." Lock, who is listed at 6 feet 9 
inches but is actually 6-10 1/2, wears uniform No. 44. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning was the only Clipper to finish in the top 10 in all-star voting, 
the injured rookie getting 236,149 votes for seventh place among Western 
Conference forwards. . . . The Clipper record for consecutive losses is 19, set 
March 11-April 13, 1982. . . . The Clippers made 3 3-point shots, more than 
they had in the previous 8 games combined.

HORNETS WIN ON RAMBIS' SHOT AT BUZZER, 89-88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Kurt Rambis, noted for his rebounding and not for his scoring ability, would 
not be the likely candidate to take the last shot with time running out and his 
team trailing by a point. 
</P>
<P>
And while that wasn't part of the game plan, it was Rambis who grabbed a loose 
ball and scored at the buzzer Thursday night, giving the Charlotte Hornets an 
89-88 victory over the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was good because I was standing right under the red light that went 
off with the buzzer," said Rambis, who scored 8 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah had gone in front, 88-87, on a basket by Eric Leckner with 47 seconds 
remaining. After misses by both teams, the Hornets called time out with 8 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Tripucka inbounded to Michael Holton, who drove the left baseline but had 
his shot blocked. Rambis picked up the ball and gave his team the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael didn't want to take the jumper, so he drove to the basket and got his 
shot blocked," Rambis said. "The ball bounced into my hands, and I just put it 
up and in as time ran out." 
</P>
<P>
Rambis faces his former team tonight when the Hornets play the Lakers at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Tripucka, returning to Utah for the first time since being picked in the 
expansion draft by Charlotte, said the last play was designed for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to take it to the hole, but Holton was wide open, and I thought he 
would jump it in," Tripucka said. "But he took it inside. Fortunately, Kurt was 
in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets' win, only their third on the road this season against 18 losses, 
ended a 4-game losing streak. The Jazz, meanwhile, lost for only the third time 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 129, Miami 108 -- Alex English scored 34 points, and Walter Davis came 
off the bench for 17 to lead Denver past the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored all of his points in the second half and 13 during a 20-5 
fourth-quarter run that sealed the victory, which ended a 4-game losing streak. 
The Nuggets had lost their 9 previous games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Denver played with only eight players after a trade earlier in the day sent 
Calvin Natt and Jay Vincent to the San Antonio Spurs for David Greenwood and 
Darwin Cook. Greenwood and Cook did not make it to Miami in time for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 127, Portland 109 -- Larry Krystkowiak scored a career-high 31 
points, and Ricky Pierce came off the bench to add 25 as the Bucks won at 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 126, Indiana 106 -- The Pacers lost at Landover, Md., to match the 
Miami Heat for the worst road record in the National Basketball Assn. at 1-19. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets, playing the second half without Coach Wes McLeod who was suffering 
back spasms, led by as many as 23 points early in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 112, New Jersey 109 -- Kenny Smith had 24 points and 10 assists, and 
rookie Rick Berry scored 20 points as the Kings won at East Rutherford, N.J.

RAMBIS WILL BE RUNNING INTO SOME OF HIS OLD FRIENDS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can dress Kurt Rambis in a pleated teal uniform, make him change oceans and 
divisions, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and put him on an expansion team 
that might lose as many games as the Lakers will win. But you cannot change 
Rambis' inimitable style and irrepressible persona. 
</P>
<P>
He will still be the guy whose glasses have been knocked askew while 
body-slamming under the basket and whose hair falls in his face while he's 
diving for loose balls. 
</P>
<P>
Rambis' rebounding and unceasing effort, which once spawned a cult following 
("Rambis Youth") at the Forum, is a constant on which the Lakers no longer can 
rely and, yes, now miss. 
</P>
<P>
"We miss his rebounding," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We miss his spirit. We 
miss those intangibles." 
</P>
<P>
One came Thursday night when Rambis picked up a loose ball and scored at the 
buzzer to beat the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Rambis, who as a free agent signed a 4-year contract with the 
Charlotte Hornets last summer, will make his first appearance at the Forum 
since helping the Lakers win their second straight National Basketball Assn. 
championship last spring. He will be given his championship ring in a ceremony 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be strange coming back, but a good kind of strange," said 
Rambis, who will turn 31 next month. "I think the only thing they really miss 
from me is the jokes I told in the locker room. I've only seen about 3 Laker 
games on TV this year, so I couldn't even tell you what their problems are or 
if I have anything to do with it. Let's just say I always felt an integral part 
of that team. I don't know how losing me affected them." 
</P>
<P>
While Rambis has thrived in his new situation, averaging 10.4 points and 9.6 
rebounds in 30 minutes each game as the Hornets' starting power forward, the 
Lakers have doggedly carried on without him. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken some alteration of the Lakers' game, but Rambis' rebounding chores 
have been absorbed by James Worthy, Mychal Thompson and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy has improved his rebounding average from 5.0 a game last season to 6.3 
this season. Mychal Thompson has improved from 6.1 a game to 6.6, and Magic 
Johnson from 6.2 to 7.7, second only to A.C. Green's 7.9. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, free agent Orlando Woolridge was signed as Rambis' replacement. 
But the expectations are different with Woolridge, a scorer but not a 
rebounder. Woolridge is averaging 3.4 rebounds in 21.5 minutes a game this 
season. Last season, Rambis averaged 3.8 rebounds in 12.1 minutes a game, 
leading the Lakers in rebounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
The void left by Rambis cannot be filled with statistics, however. The Lakers 
simply aren't receiving that jolt off the bench they did during Rambis' tenure, 
resulting in fewer fast breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a style all his own," Worthy said of Rambis. "Nobody dove on the floor 
like Kurt. Nobody got people going like he did. I think that's what people miss 
most. But we're still getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Not without difficulty, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of lean on team rebounding now," Riley said. "We don't have the one 
dominant rebounder. We've got to 5-man rebound the basketball now. Maybe that 
hurts our break a bit, but when you're 20th in the league in rebounding, you 
have to go all-out." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy said he has put special emphasis on the rebounding aspect of his game 
this season because of Rambis' absence. So far, Worthy has been able to improve 
his rebounding average by 1.3 a game while also increasing his scoring average 
from 19.7 to 21 a game. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley said Worthy is capable of getting close to double figures in 
rebounding every game, which he has accomplished in 3 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something I'm trying to improve on," Worthy said. "I've always 
rebounded decently. We need more collective rebounding. We can't depend on A.C. 
all the time. But we're all trying to get the boards now." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Riley wants Woolridge to exert himself more under the basket. "I'd 
like to see Orlando propel his body toward the basket on the boards like he 
does (when he has the ball)," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Rambis said he does not regret leaving the Lakers, who would not give him the 
long-term contract he desired, and that he is happy playing 30 minutes a game, 
albeit on a losing team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in looking back," Rambis said. "I don't regret leaving at all. 
I made a decision based on what was beneficial to my family. I like playing (in 
Charlotte). I like helping this franchise grow into something and hope to be 
part of it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, but Riley thinks Rambis also may be longing for his days as a 
Laker. Certainly, as Riley said, the Lakers miss Rambis. "I think, deep in 
Kurt's heart -- I don't care what he says -- he's got purple and gold all over 
him," Riley said. "He doesn't look good in that uniform, whatever their colors 
are."

Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union has been added to the pole vault field 
after setting a world indoor record of 19 feet 8 1/4 inches at Leningrad last 
Sunday. Gataullin broke the record of 19-7 held by countryman Sergei Bubka 
since March 1987. Bubka still holds the outdoor record of 19-9 1/2.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ILLINOIS, IN FIRST GAME AS NO. 1, LOSES TO MINNESOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After its long climb to the top of the hill, Illinois' fall from grace was 
swift. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Illini, the last undefeated team in Division I, were knocked off 
their perch by Minnesota, 69-62, Thursday night in a Big Ten Conference game at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribute to our young men and how hard they worked to be No. 1," 
Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "But (being ranked first) certainly doesn't 
help you win ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (17-1 overall, 4-1 in the Big Ten) was playing its first game since 
rising to the No. 1 spot Monday. In 1952, the last time the Illini were No. 1 
during the regular season, they were beaten by DePaul in their first game after 
reaching the top. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (11-5, 3-3) was effective in its zone defense, especially since 
Illinois lost standout point guard Kendall Gill, third in the Big Ten in 
3-point shooting, with a broken foot in its last game. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat the No. 1 team," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said. "Sure, they could 
have played better. But I'm very, very proud of my Gophers." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota pulled off its second upset in 12 days, having beaten then-No. 5 Iowa 
on Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Gophers, but it was his 
passing that helped turn the game Minnesota's way. 
</P>
<P>
Burton made remarkable passes on three straight plays during a 13-0 run in the 
first half that gave the Gophers a 25-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so high because I've never played against a No. 1 team in college," 
Burton said. "We were juiced up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota built its lead to 20 points with 9:56 left and held off a late 
Illinois rally. Kenny Battle scored 5 points in a 10-0 run that got the Illini 
within 61-59 with 5:16 left. Then Burton hit a basket, Lynch added 2 free 
throws and it was over. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 88, Duke 73 -- Brian Howard scored 23 points, and the 
15th-ranked Wolfpack handed the No. 8 Blue Devils their third straight defeat 
in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (13-3, 3-3), mired in a slump after winning its first 13 games, played 
without All-American Danny Ferry, who has been bothered by back spasms all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State (13-2, 4-1) had a 48-38 lead on Chucky Brown's basket with 
15:39 left, but the Blue Devils rallied and surged ahead, 63-61, on Robert 
Brickey's shot with 10:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
But N.C. State turned 3 steals into baskets and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Alaa Abdelnaby scored 24 points, and Brickey added 19, while Brown scored 15 
for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 78, Wisconsin 70 -- Roy Marble got 24 points and became Iowa's all-time 
leading scorer as the 12th-ranked Hawkeyes downed the Badgers in a Big Ten game 
at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Marble, a 6-foot 6-inch senior, broke the record of 1,768 points set by Greg 
Stokes 4 years ago. Ed Horton added 22 points for Iowa (15-3, 2-2), which 
played its first home game since Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa led by 11 points at halftime and made it 53-40 on B.J. Armstrong's 3-point 
shot. But Wisconsin (15-3, 3-2) scored the next 3 baskets, including a 
3-pointer by Tim Locum, to get within 53-47 with 10:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin came within 66-62 with 3:42 left, but Horton scored 3 of Iowa's next 
5 points to finish off the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jones scored 27 points for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 95, So. Mississippi 76 -- Pervis Ellison scored 26 points, and the 
third-ranked Cardinals trounced the Golden Eagles in a Metro Conference game at 
Hattiesburg, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 43-39 halftime lead, Louisville (14-2, 3-0) broke it open with a 
22-6 surge to open the second half and rolled to its 14th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Bates scored 17 points for Southern Mississippi (6-9, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 69, South Carolina 67 -- George McCloud hit a 3-pointer with 7 
seconds left to give the No. 11 Seminoles a Metro Conference victory over the 
Gamecocks at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina (12-4, 2-2), which took the lead on Terry Dozier's 2 free throws 
with 37 seconds left, couldn't get off a shot after McCloud hit. 
</P>
<P>
Tat Hunter scored 20 points for Florida State (15-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 100, Northwestern 68 -- Perry Carter scored 25 points as the No. 17 
Buckeyes rolled past the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Burson added 19 points, and Jerry Francis scored 11 for Ohio State (14-4, 
4-2), which took a 23-4 lead and never was threatened. Northwestern is 8-9 and 
1-6.

GAUCHOS SQUEEZE PAST 49ERS, 53-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara won another game Thursday night, and the Gauchos did it the 
way Coach Jerry Pimm knew they would have to. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, I thought if we were going to win, we'd have to do it at the other 
(defensive) end," Pimm said after the Gauchos (15-1 overall, 6-1 in the Big 
West Conference) edged Cal State Long Beach, 53-52, before a sellout crowd of 
2,237 in the 49ers' gym. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had two opportunities to win the game in the last minute but failed 
each time. Trailing by the eventual final score, the 49ers got the ball with 
1:10 left on a steal by guard Tyrone Mitchell. They couldn't get off a shot, 
and with the shot clock showing 8 seconds, Mitchell had the ball knocked away 
by Carlton Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Elliott of the Gauchos was fouled and, following two timeouts, missed the 
front end of a one-and-one, giving the 49ers a last chance with 24 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The only shot they could get wasn't a good one -- a running one-hander by 
Darrell Faulkner that was well off the mark just before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
"We executed well all night, but on the last play we didn't execute worth a 
darn," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. "It was disarray. What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
The game was such an aggressive defensive battle that 4 points were the most 
that ever separated the teams. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (7-10, 4-4) led, 30-29, at halftime but never regained the lead 
after Mike Doyle put the Gauchos ahead, 31-30, at the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Doyle who hurt the 49ers the most late in the game, breaking ties of 
47-47 and 51-51 with baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"They get the ball to the right person at the right time," Harrington said, 
speaking of Doyle, who led the Gauchos with 11 points, 8 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Foul-shooting trouble was another reason why the 49ers' upset bid fell short. 
Mitchell missed the front end of a one-and-one with 2:07 to go and Santa 
Barbara ahead, 53-51. 
</P>
<P>
Then with 1:41 left and the score the same, Jeff Eastin went to the foul line 
with a chance to pull the 49ers even. 
</P>
<P>
Eastin, who had missed only one free throw all season, made the first shot but 
missed the second. 
</P>
<P>
Center John Hatten led the 49ers with 21 points. He had tied the game at 49-49, 
but his last attempt was blocked by Eric McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of five chances the 49ers had to either tie or go ahead in the 
last 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of our better efforts of the year," Harrington said. "It was a 
great college basketball game, and it was an indication what our players can do 
out there. We just weren't quite good enough."

USC COMES UP SHORT ONCE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS 0-7 IN PAC-10 AFTER 84-75 DEFEAT BY WASHINGTON 
</P>

<P>
George Raveling, USC basketball coach, sighed as he studied the final 
statistics of the Trojans' 84-75 loss to Washington Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of years ago, on one of those cold winter nights in Pullman (where he 
spent 11 years coaching at Washington State), I was reading Mark Twain because 
there wasn't anything else to do," Raveling said. "Mark Twain wrote, 'Do you 
want the stats or the facts?' If you look at the stats, it doesn't tell the 
story of this game. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sent these stats to Peking, they'd think it was a helluva game, but it 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the announcer at Hec Edmundson Pavilion had a premonition of the quality 
of the game when he greeted the crowd of 3,126 with: "Welcome, dog fans!" 
</P>
<P>
For much of the game, the Trojans and the Huskies threw passes to fans in the 
stands. USC had 20 turnovers and Washington 18. 
</P>
<P>
Routine jumpers turned into airballs, and dunks caromed back to the court. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 7-11 overall and 0-7 in the conference, but Raveling remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I walk out and look at the heavens and say, 'Why me?' " Raveling 
said. "I give money to the church, I help old ladies across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"If it keeps going like this, I'm going to have a spot up there because it's 
been hell on earth." 
</P>
<P>
After losing 5 straight games, the Huskies (7-9, 4-4) have won 4 of their last 
6 to placate the critics who were calling for the ouster of Coach Andy Russo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Washington did a nice job," Raveling said. "It's the first time I've 
seen them in person this season, and Andy does a real nice job. I think coaches 
get too much credit when they win and too much criticism when they lose. They 
(the Huskies) have the basic ingredients to be a nice team." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Eldridge Recasner scored 14 first-half points, and forward Mike Hayward 
added 13 as the Huskies took control with a 12-0 run. They led by as many as 13 
points before USC trimmed their lead to 45-37 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Recasner finished with 25 points, Hayward with 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Eldridge was real determined in the first half," Russo said. "He and Hayward 
came out of the blocks fast." 
</P>
<P>
Center Mark West and forward Dion Brown also played well for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
West had 17 points and a team-high 8 rebounds. Brown, a sophomore forward from 
Crenshaw High School, had 10 points and 6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
USC's offense was led by guard Anthony Pendleton, who scored a team-high 23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said the Trojans are frustrated by their slump, but they haven't 
given up hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can't let it get to us," Pendleton said. "We have got to continue 
to work hard and we'll come out of this." 
</P>
<P>
Said reserve forward Alan Pollard, "It's tempting for everybody to abandon ship 
and get into the lifeboats, but we're not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans play Washington State Sunday at 1 p.m. in Pullman, Wash. The game 
will be shown on Channel 2. Washington plays UCLA Saturday at 3 p.m. . . . 
Washington junior guard Maurice Riggs was suspended indefinitely, Coach Andy 
Russo announced before the game. Russo said Riggs violated team rules 
concerning academics. Riggs was a reserve forward who had averaged 1.1 points 
in 14 games.

<P>
A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCOUTS TO OFFER SOUTH COUNTY SAFE-RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South County Safe-Rides, a student-run program aimed at combatting teen-age 
drinking and driving, will be launched next month at Capistrano by the Sea 
Hospital in Dana Point. Established and maintained under the auspices of the 
Exploring Division of the Boy Scouts of America, the program provides safe and 
confidential rides home to fellow students who have been drinking or riding 
with someone who has. 
</P>
<P>
Safe-Rides in no way advocates teen-age alcohol consumption, its sponsors 
stress, but it is aimed at reducing tragedies because of drunk driving, 
according to Hal Day, chief executive officer of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Feb. 3, Capistrano by the Sea will be the base of operations for 
Safe-Rides every Friday and Saturday night from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. "Adult 
volunteers who have completed a training session are on site to oversee the 
activities," Day said 
</P>
<P>
Students on each participating high school campus have formed a Safe-Rides club 
to inform other students about the dangers of alcohol and other substance 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is this positive peer pressure that makes it easier for a teen-ager to 
refuse a drink or avoid riding with someone who has been drinking, without fear 
of criticism," Day added. 
</P>
<P>
Students at San Clemente, Dana Hills and St. Margaret high schools have begun a 
mass distribution of wallet-size cards and key chains with the South County 
Safe-Rides phone number -- (714) 83-ALIVE. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age and adult volunteers are prepared for duty by having completed a 
4-hour training program directed by the Boy Scouts, which includes 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, emergency procedures, alcohol awareness 
and communication skills. An emphasis on confidentiality is designed to ensure 
the trust of fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
One of more than 650 such programs established nationwide by the Boy Scouts, 
the South County Safe-Rides actually began 10 months ago at San Clemente High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano by the Sea Hospital is an inpatient psychiatric hospital affiliated 
with the UC Irvine College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>

There is certainly enough going on in our world on a day-to-day basis to supply 
us with dream material for some time to come. But add the ugly harshness of 
reality to the bizarre realm of fantasy, and you will have the stuff of which 
nightmares are made.

SINGLE LIFE: BROOKS BROS. OR PIERCED EARS -- WHAT DO WOMEN LIKE ON MEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, we took a look at ways women can dress to enhance their appeal to 
eligible bachelors. Today we give equal time to the other side of the equation: 
how men should dress to attract women. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, experts advise, leave the office at the office. Three-piece 
pin stripes have their place -- and that place is not after-work cocktail 
parties or dinner dates. 
</P>
<P>
"Women see men all day in suits," said Los Angeles-based color and design 
consultant Jennifer Butler, who presents seminars in Orange County. "When they 
go out at night, they like something a little more casual. 
</P>
<P>
"If a man doesn't have time to go home and change after leaving the office, he 
should bring along a sports jacket and a more casual tie to change into. Even 
if he's just going out for a drink, he should look as different as possible 
from what he worked in. He'll feel more relaxed if he creates a different 
expression for himself." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect to be in the same frame of mind dressed in a business suit as 
you would be dressed in more casual wear," agreed Viken Momdjian, president of 
Politix, a Southern California-based chain of men's clothing stores. "If you go 
to a party in a business suit, you'll find yourself talking business the whole 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll present the wrong personality for that environment. You might appear 
stuffy and unapproachable. When you're trying to meet women, looking accessible 
is very important." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there's nothing like overdressing for a social event to ensure that 
you will feel awkward and conspicuous all night, added fashion consultant Aggie 
Manville of Aggie's the Total Look in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to be a little bit underdressed than overdressed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Butler admonished, the definition of casual wear is not faded jeans 
and a Windbreaker -- unless the date entails a hike in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"When I consult men about their wardrobes, time and time again what they're 
missing the most are things that would be nice for dating," she said. "On one 
extreme, they have shorts to go out on a boat, and on the other extreme, they 
have suits for the office -- but nothing in between. They don't own a pair of 
dressy pleated slacks, a nice sweater or a silk shirt." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa bachelor Marcus Meleton, who bravely volunteered to act as our model 
for "do" and "don't" dating attire, fit that stereotype to a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see . . . ," he said, contemplating his closet. "All I have are suits 
and blue jeans. Will jeans with a pair of tennis shoes be OK for the 'after' 
picture?" 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old aerospace engineer came up with a blue pin-striped "banker's 
suit" to illustrate the office-only image. "It's what I wear when I have to 
give presentations," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
For a casual-yet-sophisticated night-on-the-town appearance, Meleton unearthed 
his seldom-worn gray pleated slacks and cordovan loafers. A pale-pink Oxford 
shirt and blue tweed sports coat completed his "preppy look" -- a favorite of 
Orange County women, according to an informal poll conducted at the Sports 
Connection health club in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I love khakis, loafers, a button-down shirt," said Sandy Ludwick, 25, a 
business analyst in Costa Mesa. She also likes the clean-cut look. 
</P>
<P>
Variations on that basic, conservative style were expressed recurringly, in a 
number of ways: the Brooks Bros. look, the yuppie look, the all-American look, 
the boy-next-door look, the continental look, the "thirtysomething" look. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Michael on (the television series) 'thirtysomething'?" asked Jan 
McDonald, 30, a marketing consultant in Irvine. "He's my ideal of how a man 
should dress: suspenders that give him a slightly arty look, plaid shirts that 
make him look homey, hair that's well-groomed but not military-short." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into an overly hep look," said Libby Zoe, 32, a Newport Beach sales 
manager. "I like tweed jackets, sweaters, glasses with tortoise-shell rims." 
</P>
<P>
Fear not -- women still admire a man in jeans. "I definitely like the look of 
jeans with a sports coat," said 25-year-old Denise Spicer of Costa Mesa, an 
assistant buyer for a department store. "Jeans go great with a sweater vest 
over a shirt with a button-down collar. But no cowboy boots -- yuck!" 
</P>
<P>
"I lust after men in jeans and white T-shirts -- the Bruce Springsteen kind," 
confessed Orange resident Amy Bellows, 35, a hotel publicist. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever "look" a man chooses, said George Pinckney of the Fashion Academy in 
Costa Mesa, he should look himself. "A woman can recognize a phony a mile 
away," he warned. "Not every man is Mr. Macho or Mr. Business Executive or Mr. 
Arty. I would look and feel ridiculous if I suddenly went out and got an ear 
pierced and started wearing flamboyant clothes." 
</P>
<P>
As she advises women, Butler said that men should dress to attract their 
"type." The accountant whose tastes run on the conservative side should stick 
with that all-American, preppy style. The musician desperately seeking an 
artistic soul mate, on the other hand, might let his hair down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"A pierced ear can look really great on a man," Butler said. "But he's sending 
out a message about himself, and he needs to be sure it's the message he wants 
to convey. He's saying: 'I'm creative, I'm a free spirit, I'm not mainstream.' 
And that's the kind of woman he is going to attract." 
</P>
<P>
One final note on business suits: They may be inappropriate evening wear for 
most occasions, but women nonetheless appreciate a man in corporate-world 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the ultimate is a three-piece, pin-striped suit -- the Wall Street 
look," said Carol Meyer, 29, an interior designer in Huntington Beach. "Men 
can't dress sexier than that."

WIFE, HUSBAND CIRCLE THE GLOBE IN THE PURSUIT OF HIGH FASHION

It had been an exhilarating week. Laguna Beach fashion designer and boutique 
owner D.N. Evans had just finished creating wardrobes for five county women 
attending last week's presidential inauguration when she got a call from an 
official in the Soviet Union requesting her help in developing that nation's 
fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
That was 2 weeks ago. Since then Evans, born Donna Shaw in Chicago in "the 
early 1940s," has put the finishing touches on her new spring line and prepared 
for a globe-circling trip in search of hand-woven fabrics for use in the 
designs she shows and sells exclusively in her Laguna Beach salon, D.N. Evans 
Couture. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and her husband/partner Michael have built their business on the 
philosophy that clothes must be comfortable and elegant. They have peddled that 
philosophy to prominent names, including Barbra Streisand, Ali McGraw and 
Margaux Hemingway. In Orange County, Evans has dressed Judie Argyros, Harriet 
Nelson and Ginny Ueberroth (she designed the gowns for Ueberroth's daughter's 
wedding). And for the inaugural celebrations, she created 10 outfits for Orange 
County businesswoman Kathryn Thompson alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say, God bless the ladies of Orange County," said the designer, who 
was wearing fuchsia-knit separates and tiny round sunglasses with her dark hair 
pulled back. "The women of Orange County are so much more enlightened and 
educated (than they used to be). They travel all the time, and because there is 
such a heightened social scene, they know they have to look terrific. And they 
have a great appreciation for art." 
</P>
<P>
One characteristic of the Evanses' clothes is workmanship. The couple employ 
about 30 seamstresses who work in their own homes or in a factory in Costa 
Mesa. Each seamstress is responsible for an entire garment and much of the work 
is done by hand. "The cost is greater, but the quality is more controllable," 
Michael Evans says. It is this workmanship and cottage-industry concept that 
the couple will discuss with Soviets when they attend a business and trade 
development conference in Moscow in October. 
</P>
<P>
Quality workmanship and art have always been important to the Evanses. Both 
have art backgrounds. Michael, who designed the boutique, is a former sculptor. 
D.N., who attended the Art Institute of Chicago and in 1987 received the Orange 
County Arts Alliance award for outstanding contributions in design, started out 
designing jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
As a self-described "high-fashion flower child," she spent the late '60s 
traveling through Europe, learning about art and fashion by visiting museums 
and exploring cities. By the 1970s she had begun marketing jewelry she 
designed, which appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar magazines and 
high-fashion boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
One day, on a business trip to Los Angeles promoting her jewelry, the Evanses 
got lost and ended up in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a day like today," D.N. recalled on a recent clear and sunny morning in 
her salon. "Picture it: I'd never been to Southern California before, traveling 
here from the East in the middle of winter. I thought, what a great place. . . 
. I don't know how I got here, but I'm not going back." 
</P>
<P>
She had gained a reputation in the '70s with her contemporary silver and stone 
jewelry and accessories, such as the soft-leather hobo bag, but had yet to 
venture into clothes design. 
</P>
<P>
She and Michael settled in Laguna Beach in 1974 and began raising a large 
family (the couple have six children). It wasn't long before she decided the 
place needed a fashion designer. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing around and designed a little tube top and short wide pants, 
which became my trademarks," D.N. said. "People kept asking me for them. It was 
that simple. And the business grew and grew." 
</P>
<P>
Michael said his military background and his wife's love of comfortable 
traveling clothes helped steer them into marketing what they call "no-excuse" 
fashions -- high-styled, yet soft and unstructured. 
</P>
<P>
"I was used to (there being) no excuses for a sloppy uniform," he says. "You 
had to be no-nonsense about the way you looked. We combined that with comfort. 
Our criteria was: Can you get on a horse and ride out of town in it?" 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years D.N. has focused more on evening wear, applying the same 
concepts of comfort to more glamorous designs. 
</P>
<P>
She grabbed a white wrinkled-silk bustier to show how the piece can go with a 
long ballerina-length skirt or wide-legged pants. Versatility and comfort are 
the key elements, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled to say I dressed quite a few women for the inaugural with this 
concept," she said. "The idea is you can take these comfortable formal parts 
and wear them different ways. They're evening separates. Of course, the pieces 
are expensive, but think of the mileage." 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, hand-woven fabrics from Southeast Asia have dominated her 
collection. She buys the material overseas, brings it home and designs clothes 
for the fabrics. Each piece is hand cut and hand sewn. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my inspiration comes from the peasants I see on my travels," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making investment clothing from fabrics that are works of art," said 
Michael, fondling a piece of material from Laos. "You have to go farther and 
farther to find people still doing this kind of work. You don't find 2,000 
yards of this fabric. You're lucky if you find six pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The shop is half couture and half ready-to-wear, with everything designed by 
D.N. Prices range from $350 for a ready-to-wear ensemble to $4,800 for a 
couture evening outfit. Last week she displayed a layered-cotton skirt made of 
hand-woven cloth from Southeast Asia, $1,250; a white Thai silk bustier, $750; 
a black-silk evening skirt, $1,250; a kimono jacket made of fabrics from 
Southeast Asia, $750, and a fuchsia double-breasted blazer, $650. 
</P>
<P>
Her spring clothes include wheat-colored hemp jackets, organza silk wide-legged 
pants, silk and beaded vests and lots of black-and-white and navy-and-white 
dressy separates.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: IT'S A CRIME WHAT THEY OFFER TO TV

Missing from television: innovation. 
</P>
<P>
If you find it, please notify the National Assn. of Television Program 
Executives, which is holding its annual convention here this week. Just dial 
the 800 number. . . . 
</P>
<P>
TV boldly continues to break old ground. 
</P>
<P>
The success of NBC'S "Unsolved Mysteries" and Fox Broadcasting's crime-driven 
"A Current Affair" and "America's Most Wanted" has spawned a surge of proposed 
variations, imitators and piggybackers, putting a distinctive brand on this 
annual marketplace for syndicated programs. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on sales results here and the tolerance of the public, TV may be on 
the verge of transforming viewers into junior G-men, either vicariously or in 
actuality. 
</P>
<P>
As a sales brochure for one prospective series shouts: "CRIME GETS RATINGS!" 
</P>
<P>
Given what may be coming and the bulk of violent crime already available on TV 
via news and entertainment programming, it's easy to see how viewers might 
develop a siege mentality. Add to this volatile mix an easy access to guns, and 
the worst-case scenario follows: You pick up your AK-47 assault rifle and get 
"them" before "they" get you. 
</P>
<P>
Call it tabloid TV, trash TV, crime TV, reality-based TV or even 
vigilantevision. Whatever the label, the trend speaks volumes about the 
industry's collective mind and lack of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the new series and specials being offered here: 
</P>
<P>
"Crimewatch Tonight," "Crime Diaries," "Crimestoppers 800," "Cop Talk: Behind 
the Shield," "The Investigators," "Reward," "Missing/Reward," "Trial by Jury," 
"Tabloid," "Crimes of the Century," "Manhunt," "America's Search for Missing 
Children," "Has Anybody Seen My Child?" and "National Lost and Found." 
</P>
<P>
Lost but not found: your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Although a tight buying market and a paucity of open time slots make it likely 
that very few of these programs will ever get on the air, their sheer volume 
and diversity are stunning. Some are "search" shows along the lines of 
"America's Most Wanted," offering dramatic re-creations of crimes, pictures of 
criminals or missing persons and telephone numbers that viewers can call to 
turn in suspects or give information about missing children. Some advertise 
rewards being offered by agencies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Not only ratings but also the futures of some veteran news people are on the 
line here. Already, former KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchor Dan Miller and ex-KNBC 
Channel 4 anchor Nick Clooney have had their careers somewhat rejuvenated, if 
dramatically altered, as regulars on "The Pat Sajak Show" and the syndicated 
"On Trial," respectively. Now the same may happen to former CBS News 
correspondent Ike Pappas as host of "Crimewatch Tonight" and former NBC 
correspondent and "Today" host Jim Hartz, who co-hosts "Reward" with former Los 
Angeles TV reporter Cynthia Allison. 
</P>
<P>
The newest crime genre is defended by another news veteran, Reese Schonfeld, a 
former CNN president who now produces Orion's "Crimewatch Tonight," a weekday 
half-hour magazine that's among the most promising of the new crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think what we are doing is as psychologically provocative as the 
tough, fictional crime shows," he said. "And I don't think we're increasing the 
national paranoia. I think the kind of things that scare people are local 
crime, not the stories that we do that are so far removed from them." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that much of the criticism of the crime-show trend comes from 
newspapers, Schonfeld said: "It's because we're moving in on turf they've 
always had to themselves. The Wall Street Journal has the best crime stories in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Schonfeld is convinced that the realism of a successful entertainment series -- 
NBC's "Hill Street Blues" -- was a sort of subliminal motivator for some 
"reality" show producers. And, as he points out, not to be excluded as an 
influence is "60 Minutes," whose most spectacular stories are often about 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the prototype," Schonfeld said as he switched on a sales tape of his 
series, which will run on KCOP Channel 13 if enough other stations sign up to 
carry it. 
</P>
<P>
"She is young. She is beautiful. She wants to be a star," began Pappas. The 
story, crisply reported by former network correspondent Liz Trotta, echoed one 
that "60 Minutes" did about young girls who get into trouble seeking modeling 
fame abroad. "Our piece is better," Schonfeld claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"And now the story of the doctor who couldn't keep his hands off his patients," 
Pappas continued on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
If "Crimewatch Tonight" is relatively lofty, Quintex Entertainment's "Crime 
Diaries" surely occupies the basement. A weekday half-hour designed to bridge 
soap operas and early news, it "takes you inside the crimes and passions of 
today." Woman: "He didn't have to force me!" 
</P>
<P>
This is undoubtedly the truest account of police work yet, offering "mystery, 
murder, blackmail, passion, deceit, jealousy, lust, love." Then the swanky 
sales brochure adds: "And it's all real." Well, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The format: Actors playing detectives re-create cases from "actual police 
records." Based on a tape being shown here to prospective buyers, there's 
extreme violence accompanied by frenzied, up-tempo music. 
</P>
<P>
The characters: One of the females is Detective Jimmy Jenkins. "Gorgeous. Sexy 
without trying to be. A rookie with real promise. Very married, but not what it 
appears. And with Chief Pierce the attraction is mutual." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the brochure describing the target audience: 
</P>
<P>
"Women. They want emotion. The drama of ongoing relationships. Big city 
detectives in love, hate, friendship . . . danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Men. They are fascinated by crime. The straight-out-of-the-headlines crimes 
with non-stop action. And, they want solutions!" 
</P>
<P>
Quintex caused a small uproar in October by placing a full-page ad for "Crime 
Diaries" in a trade magazine. It showed a man with a knife assaulting a woman 
under the headline: "Women like the romantic intrigue. Men like the realistic 
action." 
</P>
<P>
"Crime Diaries" has a 50-50 chance of getting on the air, said Charles 
Schreger, Quintex executive vice president in charge of programming. 
</P>
<P>
Another variation on the crime-show theme, "Cop Talk: Behind the Shield," is 
already cleared for an April premiere (on KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles), 
according to Tribune Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly hour hosted by New York cop-turned-TV producer Sonny Grosso, "Cop 
Talk" is a talk show with police recalling their cases. Violent cases, 
according to a sales tape: 
</P>
<P>
"The bullet went through my head. . . . I returned fire. . . . I hit him twice 
in the chest, and he dropped." 
</P>
<P>
The newest wrinkle in the genre, though -- potentially turning Americans into 
electronic bounty hunters -- is the "Dialing for Dollars" concept embodied in 
"Reward," "Crime Stoppers 800," "Manhunt," "Missing/Reward" and "Lost and 
Found." 
</P>
<P>
A weekday half-hour from Barbour and Langley, the producing team behind most of 
Geraldo Rivera's raunchy specials and the recent "Cops" special on Fox, 
MCA-TV's "Reward" induces viewers to help solve crimes and find missing 
persons. It does this by advertising rewards ($260,000 is the top one on a 
promotional tape) that are being offered by various agencies. An agency's 800 
telephone number is shown following a dramatic re-creation of the crime and the 
display of a picture of the person or persons being sought. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you seen this face?" 
</P>
<P>
All-American Television's "Crime Stoppers 800" operates on the same principle, 
except that the hosts/narrators are Seattle cop Larry Gross and Ken Walton, 
deputy director of the FBI. The same goes for the LBS prospective series 
"Manhunt," which was introduced last month as a special. As was Group W's 
"Missing/Reward," which focuses less on criminals than on missing persons and 
lost items. It offered cash for Marilyn Monroe's red diary on the special 
hosted by Stacy Keach. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there's Quintex's weekly "National Lost and Found," whose host, Pat 
O'Brien, promises: "Whatever's been lost, we connect you to somebody who can 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, M&amp;M's "America's Search for Missing Children" and Ascot's "Has 
Anybody Seen My Child?" are strictly in the kid business. And no monetary 
rewards! 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Shirley Jones, "America's Search for Missing Children" claims 
"backing from the most missing children's agencies" and has a "go" for three 
specials in the coming months (on KCOP) in hopes of building support for a 
weekly hour series. 
</P>
<P>
"Has Anybody Seen My Child?" cites its own core of support agencies for its 
prospective weekly half hour. And Ascot President Mark Rafalowsky 
understandably resents being labeled "trash TV." 
</P>
<P>
" '48 Hours' was in here taping for a segment on trash TV," he said. "I asked, 
'How can you lump us together? We are not trash TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
Or is tabloid the proper label for many of the shows being sold here, 
especially ones like the already premiered "Inside Edition" (on KCBS-TV) and 
the gossipy new weekday Paramount series that has taken "Tabloid" as its title? 
</P>
<P>
It's not the individual shows that are especially dangerous. In fact, some 
suspects have already been caught and missing persons found via those 800 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
It's the genre as a whole, its potential collective success perhaps prompting 
other programs -- even newscasts -- to junk it up and increasingly focus on 
flashy stories in order to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Will it happen? As Stacy Keach advised in "Missing/Reward": "Keep your eyes 
open."

BRITISH TV DOCUMENTARY VINDICATED

<TEXT>
<P>
An independent inquiry made public Thursday vindicated a controversial British 
TV documentary, marking a rare victory for embattled TV journalists here. The 
findings were a slap in the face for the Thatcher government, which quickly 
criticized them. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary in question, "Death on the Rock," produced by the commercial TV 
company Thames Television, questioned the official version of one of the 
government's most controversial acts -- the shooting by undercover British 
soldiers in Gibraltar last March of three unarmed IRA terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The government issued a statement condemning the inquiry's findings, saying 
that the program contained "many serious and damaging inaccuracies" and that 
the inquiry had bent over backward to be fair to the broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
The four-month inquiry, chaired by former Conservative minister Lord Windlesham 
at a cost of nearly $200,000, found that the producers were "experienced, 
painstaking and persistent. They did not bribe, bully or misrepresent those who 
took part . . . . We accept that (they) were acting in good faith and without 
ulterior motives." 
</P>
<P>
The final paragraph of the 145-page report was expected to particularly anger 
Prime Minister Maragaret Thatcher. "Whatever view is taken of the state of 
public opinion and the legitimacy of government intervention," the conclusion 
reads, "the making and screening of 'Death on the Rock' proved that freedom of 
expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all 
the means of mass communication." 
</P>
<P>
Many people in British television fear that "Death on the Rock" may be just a 
temporary victory in what they regard as a concerted government campaign to 
muzzle the medium. 
</P>
<P>
John Wakeham, majority leader in Parliament, noted that an inquest had ruled 
the killings were lawful, and said of the inquiry's report: "The government 
profoundly disagrees with it." 
</P>
<P>
The battle between the prime minister and British broadcasters has been one of 
the most notable features of Thatcher's decade in power. The government has not 
shirked from using threats, intimidation and even legislation to impose its 
will on a television industry that it views as subversive and left wing. This 
has led to some extraordinary clashes between the two -- none more dramatic 
than the current episode. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry's findings have done wonders for flagging morale among TV 
journalists here. "This is a real victory for freedom of thought and 
expression," said one senior TV Thames executive. "It shows that this 
government can't go on and on repressing freedom." 
</P>
<P>
However, many believe that in the face of controversies like this one, 
investigative journalism remains under threat. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the whole climate for investigative journalism has been 
made more difficult ever since Mrs. Thatcher came to power," said veteran TV 
journalist Michael Cockerell. "However they rationalize it, TV executives are 
less and less keen on investigation for a whole range of reasons -- most of 
which go back to No. 10 Downing Street." 
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has long been the most politically sensitive subject in 
British journalism, and "Death on the Rock" was condemned by the government 
even before it was aired last April. The foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, 
made two requests for it to be banned until after the inquest on the deaths had 
taken place in Gibraltar. But the go-ahead was given by the Independent 
Broadcasting Authority, the body responsible for regulating ITV, Britain's 
commercial network and the main opposition to the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
The TV team had gone to Gibraltar and knocked on scores of doors. The witnesses 
they found told disconcerting stories -- of people apparently executed with 
their hands up and a soldier firing into the chest of a prostrate man. The 
question at the heart of the program was whether the British soldiers were 
acting in self-defense or whether they were operating a "shoot-to-kill" policy 
-- simply eliminating a group of known terrorists outside the due process of 
the law, without arrest or trial. 
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness accounts in "Death on the Rocks" all contradicted the official 
line, and Thatcher described herself as "beyond anger" that they should have 
been broadcast. In the resulting furor, extraordinary attempts were made in the 
press to discredit the program and its chief witness, Mrs. Carmen Proetta. 
</P>
<P>
At the inquest in Gibraltar, the government produced soldiers and intelligence 
officers who claimed that the shootings were a mistake. The jury returned a 
verdict of "lawful killing." 
</P>
<P>
When one of the TV program's witnesses tried to withdraw his statements, a cry 
went up for Thames Television's blood. The company was left in little doubt 
that it would lose its franchise on the spot if it did not hold an independent 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Thames Television initiated the inquiry by Lord Windlesham, a former member of 
Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party who had himself served in Northern Ireland, 
and senior attorney Richard Rampton, who specializes in defamation law. 
</P>
<P>
When she first came to power, Thatcher's anger was mainly directed at the BBC. 
Just before the 1979 election, her closest political friend, Airey Neave, was 
blown up by Irish terrorists in the House of Commons parking lot. A BBC program 
edited by Roger Bolton (who also edited "Death on the Rock") featured an 
interview with a masked member of the Irish National Liberation Army, claiming 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Some months later, after the murder of Lord Mountbatten, a BBC team filmed an 
IRA maneuver in the small Irish village of Carrick More. An inflammatory 
account of what went on was published in a newspaper that was shown to Thatcher 
during a cabinet meeting. That afternoon in the House of Commons, she angrily 
called on the BBC to "put its house in order." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first in a series of stinging clashes between the government and the 
BBC, ranging from programs about official secrets to alleged bias in its news 
reports of the American bombing of Libya. 
</P>
<P>
There are many who believe that these bullying tactics have worked. Today, the 
BBC has fewer arguments with the government and produces little that could be 
described as investigative journalism. Michael Cockerell recently left the BBC 
after 13 years on its top current affairs show, "Panorama." "I perceived a 
significant cooling on the kind of subject I could tackle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now Thatcher has turned her attention to the commercial network, which she 
believes (with some justification) has become fat and complacent because of its 
monopoly on TV advertising. The Independent Broadcasting Authority made its 
stand on "Death on the Rock" at a particularly unfortunate moment. The 
government has decided to abolish it and replace it with a less powerful body. 
</P>
<P>
Even the government's critics concede that the government has been clever. 
Through its constant attacks on TV and its recent ban on TV interviews with 
members of Sinn Fein (the IRA's political wing), it has managed to spread the 
notion that television is full of anti-Thatcherite subversives who are on the 
side of the IRA. The prevailing climate in Britain is now one in which asking 
legitimate journalistic questions about the government is somehow equated with 
being unpatriotic. 
</P>
<P>
"Death on the Rocks" editor Roger Bolton believes that, despite the Windelshem 
report, the future of TV journalism is looking bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Windelshem inquiry would be incomprehensible to American 
journalists, because in America there is a completely different approach to 
information and the role of the press," he said. "American journalists are not 
called unpatriotic when they try to bring into the public domain information 
that is inconvenient to politicians. If we do it, it is assumed we must be left 
wing or supportive of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have to keep going. The only way the violence will end is if the IRA is 
stopped from being able to recruit people. Events like Gibraltar help them to 
continue recruiting. One has to explain that basic fact to the British public. 
The electorate has to be informed -- even if it doesn't want to know."

A NEW STAGE FOR MICHAEL JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jackson has come to the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
When the 30-year-old superstar leaves the stage after his performance tonight 
at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, he'll not only end a marathon, 16-month "Bad" 
world tour but also bid farewell to touring -- so he says. 
</P>
<P>
Having set records for the largest grossing tour in history ($125 million) and 
the largest paid attendance (4.4 million), Jackson plans to focus on recordings 
and films. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I don't think we'll 
ever go out on tour like this," Jackson's manager, Frank Dileo, said during an 
interview in Beverly Hills this week. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Dileo now intend to take a couple of months off to rest and make 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
They tentatively plan to release a double album of Jackson's greatest hits, 
complete with three new songs, this fall. Jackson's next studio album isn't 
expected before 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"He may do a show here or there, but I don't see him ever going out on the road 
again with 12 semis and 137 people. It's a very hard tour. It's 2 hours and 8 
minutes and he's working constantly. It's exhausting." 
</P>
<P>
Why is Jackson, one of the most celebrated stage performers of the modern pop 
era, retiring from concerts? 
</P>
<P>
"He's accomplished everything he has to accomplish as far as touring," said 
Dileo. "He's got the biggest gross and has played to the the most people. What 
are we going to do next time? Play for two years? That would kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor: Jackson is known to prefer film and recordings because 
performances in those media -- unlike concerts -- are preserved for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
The interview-shy Jackson has said for years that he wants to break into films, 
but Dileo said it's more of a priority now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, he was concentrating on doing a solo career and eventually a solo 
tour," Dileo said. "He's accomplished that now, so it's time to pursue this in 
earnest." 
</P>
<P>
The two hope to develop a film musical for Jackson to star in. Jackson's only 
theatrical role to date was in the 1978 film version of "The Wiz." 
</P>
<P>
"We have stacks and stacks of scripts and proposals," said Dileo. "We'll sort 
through them and see what's right for Michael." 
</P>
<P>
Finding the right property for a specialized talent like Jackson has proved to 
be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Even multimedia producer David Geffen was unable to find the right project when 
he was retained by the singer around the time of the Jacksons' 1984 "Victory" 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't come up with anything," Geffen acknowledged in a separate interview 
Thursday. "It's my failure, not his. I just wasn't interested in doing a bad 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take a special project. You can't cast him in just anything. I 
don't think you'd cast him as a dramatic actor, or that you could have 
believably cast him in 'Coming to America.' It would have to be something 
created for him." 
</P>
<P>
But Geffen added: "I don't think they could cast Fred Astaire in just any 
picture either. I think they had to develop special pictures for him too." 
</P>
<P>
Geffen suggested that the main challenge in translating Jackson's super-stardom 
to the big screen is Jackson's man-child persona, not the fact that he is 
black. "It has nothing to do with black/white issues in his case," Geffen said. 
"People don't relate to him in terms of color. He's just a unique human being: 
He's not like any other 30-year-old you know." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't bet against him," Geffen cautioned. "He's very single-minded and he's a 
very hard worker. He'll get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, is among the top producers 
who is reportedly trying to develop a film project for Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dileo said he and Jackson are prepared to wait until a suitable film 
comes along. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of artists who have chosen to do scripts that they shouldn't 
have done," Dileo said. "It's like a good poker game. You can afford to wait it 
out 'til it's right." 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing over a pot of coffee in a hotel suite, the soft-spoken Dileo said that 
the "Bad" tour, which encompassed 123 shows in 15 countries, is still something 
of a blur to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we've set a lot of records and that we've been to a lot of great 
places, but we've been on such a fast track that we haven't been able to sit 
down and reflect back on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour may well be the most expensive ever mounted, in large part because of 
Jackson's insistence on playing only three shows a week and resting the other 
four days. Dileo kept all the musicians and crew members on salary for the 
entire week, resulting in a weekly "nut" of between $500,000 and $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
The tour drew especially well in Japan, England and Germany, but early ticket 
sales were slow in Australia, where radio stations and fans were said to be put 
off Jackson by media reports of his "eccentricities." 
</P>
<P>
Dileo responded by flying top Australian DJs to Japan, where they could see 
Jackson's show first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?," said Dileo. "I told them, 'I think we're getting a bum rap. Come 
over and see for yourself.' They met Michael afterwards and then went back to 
Australia and everything was fine. That turned the tide." 
</P>
<P>
The "Bad" album has sold more than 6 million copies in this country, and is the 
only album in pop history to generate five No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
And the project isn't over yet: Dileo said that he may well authorize the 
release of an eighth single from the album, "Leave Me Alone," next week. 
</P>
<P>
The album has reportedly sold 20 million copies worldwide, about half as many 
as Jackson's previous album, "Thriller," and about one-fifth as many as 
Jackson's reported goal for the album. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with the results of 'Bad,' " Dileo said. "And next time out we'll 
try to do as good or even better. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans like to build 'em up and tear 'em down. They're like that not only 
with artists, but with Presidents too. I'm sure that affected us. But we did 
the best we could. We made the best album and the best videos we could. We 
don't have anything to be ashamed of."

KCET GETS ITS BIGGEST GRANT EVER FOR SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Launching its 25th anniversary year, public-television station KCET Channel 28 
said Thursday that it has received an unprecedented $5.3-million grant from the 
W. M. Keck Foundation to produce a six-part series about astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Astronomers," which the station said will present "the scientists and 
technologies that are revolutionizing our current knowledge of the universe," 
is scheduled for national airing on PBS during the 1990-91 TV season. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of our knowledge," said William H. Kobin, KCET's president and 
chief executive officer, "this is the largest program grant in (KCET's) 25 
years and the largest in public-television history given by a foundation to a 
single series." 
</P>
<P>
With a marked celebrity atmosphere, the announcement was jointly made in KCET's 
auditorium by the station executives and Keck Foundation officials. 
</P>
<P>
Howard B. Keck, chairman of the foundation, said he views the grant "as a 
natural extention of the foundation's commitment to scientific education. We 
hope this series will encourage more young people to enter into the study of 
science. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
David Thomas, chairman of Keck's Southern California program committee, said 
the series is "intended to benefit scientific education nationally through the 
use of television." He emphasized that the fact that KCET was concentrating 
heavily on developing educational materials to complement the series was a key 
reason Keck decided to fund the project. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the astronomy series immediately invited comparison with KCET's 
13-part series "Cosmos" in 1980. That series, which presented Carl Sagan's 
ruminations on the history and nature of the universe, cost about $8 million 
and brought the station both critical praise and financial grief. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that KCET launched "Cosmos" before it had lined up sufficient 
funding and wound up having to put up about $1 million of its own money, which, 
coupled with other difficulties, eventually helped propel the station to the 
brink of bankruptcy in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Kobin, who was hired in 1983 as a result of the management shakeup that the 
financial crisis engendered and who has led KCET back into the black, was asked 
whether he was certain the Keck grant could cover the projected cost of "The 
Astronomers." 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely yes," he responded with confidence. "How do we assume we do not 
have a budgetary problem? (Because) this budget was developed very, very 
carefully over a very long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Kobin said that the budgetary planning for the series has taken 18 months and 
includes a carefully worked-out "timetable" for receipt of the money, "so we 
know we have what we need when we need it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked further whether there were any plans to go back to Keck for more money or 
to seek other funders should the need occur, Kobin said: "First of all, the 
situation will not arise." But later he did allow that KCET, which took four 
years to get out of the red, now has a "substantial" reserve fund. He declined 
to specify how much. 
</P>
<P>
Actual development and production costs on "The Astronomers" will be about $4.6 
million. Phyllis Geller, KCET's vice president for national productions, said 
that about $300,000 of the Keck grant will go toward the educational support 
materials. Another $400,000 is earmarked for advertising and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Blaine Baggett, KCET's director of national public affairs and producer of its 
"Secret Intelligence" series now airing on PBS, will serve as executive 
producer of "The Astronomers." Production will begin this summer with coverage 
of the Voyager encounter with the planet Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
The Keck Foundation awarded $70 million to the California Institute of 
Technology in 1985 to build the world's most powerful telescope in Hawaii. Its 
technology will be used in the preparation of the series, Baggett said, 
</P>
<P>
A key adviser for the series will be Edward C. Stone, professor of physics and 
vice president for astronomical facilities at Caltech. He is also project 
scientist for the Voyager mission and chairman of the California Assn. for 
Research in Astronomy, which is building the Keck Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Baggett, who conceived the idea for the project, said he is "particularly 
interested in the process of discovery and the struggle of discovery -- the 
struggle of particular human beings. . . . I hope to make it a very human 
story."

MICHAEL JACKSON'S AGENT TAKES A LOOK AT THE MAN IN THE MIRROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Dileo and Michael Jackson are the odd couple of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't find two more different people," said Dileo. "He won't eat meat; 
I'll run out to get a cheeseburger. I'll take a drink; he won't touch the 
stuff. I'll sit and watch football; he'll go crazy if I'm doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at us -- he's skinny, I'm fat. If we stand next to each other, we 
look like the number 10." 
</P>
<P>
Dileo, who was vice president of promotion for Jackson's record company, Epic, 
before being tapped five years ago to become the singer's manager, said the 
bonds that unite them are their love for "music, perfection and hard work." 
</P>
<P>
"I think our relationship is just two people who are different (on the surface 
and yet) our basic needs are really the same," Dileo said. "We go out together 
a lot at night. We go to record and clothing stores on Ventura Boulevard 
goofing around. We ride around looking at the sights. We have a ball." 
</P>
<P>
Though Dileo and Jackson are just 11 years apart in age, their relationship 
sometimes seems like father-and-son. When Dileo recounts an illness that kept 
him from aggressively promoting a recent Jackson single which wound up breaking 
a long string of Top 10 hits, it is with the pained regret of a father who let 
his son down at a crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
And when Dileo and his wife bought a new home in Ojai recently, they made sure 
to get one with a guest room. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a nice room set up for Michael because he spends a lot of time at my 
house," said Dileo. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh native has no other clients -- at Jackson's request. "When I 
first signed with Michael, he asked that I be exclusive," Dileo said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has redone my contract twice since then, but that clause never comes out 
for some reason," he added with mock bemused smile. PAUL GREIN

**** "Floating Weeds" 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseur, $59.95. 
</P>
<P>
Yasujiro Ozu's 1959 remake of his 1934 silent classic retells the story of an 
itinerant theater troupe. Not one of Ozu's best films -- though one of only a 
handful available on video -- it is, still, clearly the work of one of the 
cinema's greatest stylists and creators. The style is simple, serene; nothing 
is overstated; the camera is always at a low angle (suggesting the first row of 
a theater, the world from a tatami mat, or a posture of Buddhist 
contemplation); the writing has a Chekhovian mix of humor and pathos; the 
actors play with restraint, precision and buried passion. Beautifully 
photographed in color by Kazuo Miyagawa ("Rashomon," "Ugetsu"). MICHAEL

New Releases 
</P>
<P>
Movies 
</P>
<P>
Play ball! No, it's not the beginning of the baseball season yet, but it is the 
start of the big-release video season, and leading off this week's lineup is 
one of the best baseball movies ever made, "Bull Durham" (Orion, $89.98, R). 
</P>
<P>
Starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, "Bull Durham" isn't 
just a baseball movie; it's sort of a romantic-metaphysical-sports comedy. And 
it's great fun. Sarandon is passionate both about the sport and its players -- 
notably the two minor-league players played by Costner and Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it's mainly tough-guy week at the video store: "Die Hard" (CBS/Fox, 
$89.98, R) even outscored "Bull Durham" at the box office last year ($78 
million to $50 million) with its tense story of a cop (Bruce Willis) vs. 
terrorists in a Los Angeles skyscraper. In "The Dead Pool" (Warner, $89.95, R), 
it's Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) vs. a serial killer. And "The Presidio" 
(Paramount, $89.95, R) stars Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in a suspense 
thriller (with relationship subplots) about a murder investigation on a 
military base. 
</P>
<P>
Anything for more sensitive viewers? Sure. With its exotic setting (India), 
quirky characters and lush color, "The River" (Connoisseur, $79.95, 1951) looks 
like one of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's films. However, this 
curious, English-language, slightly flawed, often moving picture about a girl's 
crush on a crippled American soldier was the work of the great French director 
Jean Renoir. Connoisseur is also re-releasing three foreign-language films 
previously on other video labels -- Renoir's 1937 anti-war classic "The Grand 
Illusion" ($59.95), Michelangelo Antonioni's ground-breaking, austere 1960 
drama "L'Avventura" ($79.95), and the very slow but haunting 1956 story of a 
Japanese soldier's spiritual conversion, "The Burmese Harp" ($79.95), directed 
by Kon Ichikawa. 
</P>
<P>
Other Videos 
</P>
<P>
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's . . . no, it's a basketball player in "Michael 
Jordan: Come Fly With Me" (CBS/Fox, $19.98). Arguably the sport's best current 
pro (and Magic Johnson fans will argue), the slam-jammin' Jordan's career is 
documented in this 45-minute tribute. TERRY ATKINSON

HOME TECH: EXERCISE VIDEO QUEENS NOT LIKELY TO WORK OUT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't invite home-video exercise queens Jane Fonda and Callan Pinckney to the 
same health club. They just might wind up throwing dumbbells at each other. 
</P>
<P>
These bitter rivals -- each hawking a different approach to exercising -- have 
never met. They just snipe at each other in print. Their feud, which had been 
recognized only in home-video circles until recently, has gone public now that 
both have been promoting new tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda's latest -- "Jane Fonda's Complete Workout" (Warner, $29.98), her 10th -- 
was released two weeks ago. Pinckney's "Supercallanetics" (MCA, $24.95) came 
out last fall, a follow-up to "Callanetics," a 1986 release that has grabbed a 
share of the market that has been totally dominated by Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to her new tape, Fonda, a youthful-looking 51, said: "It's 
scientific, it's fun, it's safe, it works, it's the best tape out there." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Pinckney, a youthful-looking 50, said: "Callanetics 
are safe, they're fun, they work incredibly. My tapes are the best ones on the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Chiding Callanetics, Fonda said: "If I did (in my tapes) what she did, I'd be 
shot out of the water -- from a medical and safety point of view." 
</P>
<P>
About Fonda's tapes, which feature aerobics, Pinckney said: "People are hurting 
themselves with aerobics. There's too much stress on the joints and on various 
parts of the body. That kind of exercising does more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the feud, one home-video executive insisted: "They're just 
jealous of each other. Jane doesn't like anybody butting in on her turf. She 
created the whole market. And Callan resents Jane's success. But 'Callanetics' 
is getting bigger all the time. If 'Callanetics' wasn't around, some of those 
buyers might have bought Fonda tapes." 
</P>
<P>
Though there are dozens of exercise tapes on the market, only Pinckney has been 
a real challenge to Fonda. (Media Home Entertainment's Kathy Smith is a distant 
third.) In two years, Pinckney's "Callanetics" has sold 703,000 copies, 
according to Video Marketing Newsletter, referring to sales to retailers and 
distributors. That placed her 32nd on the newsletter's list of the 100 top 
sellers of all time. 
</P>
<P>
But Fonda has four tapes higher on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Three Fonda tapes are in the Top 20 and four in the Top 30. Two -- "New 
Workout" (1985) and "Low Impact" (1986) -- sold more than 1 million copies. 
Sales of her first tape, "Jane Fonda's Workout," are at 950,000. A short tape, 
"Start Up With Jane Fonda" -- sold 780,000, and her "Prime Time Workout" has 
sold more than 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the women champions an exercise style that conflicts with what the 
other is promoting. The tapes are equally dissimilar. 
</P>
<P>
Aerobic exercises -- done to a disco beat -- are the centerpiece of Fonda's 
approach, which she has expanded to include dumbbell work. It's all flashy, 
high-energy and fairly high intensity. Fonda's tapes have a glitzy, show-biz 
sheen. 
</P>
<P>
Pinckney's Callanetics are low-intensity muscle contractions and stretches 
largely based on ballet movements. Like her exercise style, her videos are 
low-key. There's neither glitz nor loud music. The exercises are delicate, tiny 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
Born with curvature of the spine and clubbed feet, Pinckney trained in 
classical ballet to help ease the agony of those deformities. Because of 
chronic back pains, she developed exercises that would be as easy as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do anything too strenuous," she said. "That's why the motions are 
so delicate." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing her exercises to aerobics, Pinckney said, "Aerobics are intimidating. 
It looks like you have to be young and athletic and already in good shape just 
to do them. My exercises aren't intimidating. They're lots of small, precise 
movements. But they work deeply on the muscles to tighten droopy stomachs and 
behinds. Callanetics attack the saddlebags and droopy behinds that women get as 
they get older. One hour of Callanetics equals many hours of aerobics." 
</P>
<P>
But she hasn't convinced Fonda, who charged, "My exercises are safer. You can 
change your body to some extent using Callanetics, which is the kind of 
exercise where you repeat a movement and use a muscle group over and over. But 
it's not enough. You need that aerobic component." 
</P>
<P>
Pickney notes with glee, however, that many exercise physiologists now 
recommend less rigorous aerobic exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"High-intensity aerobics aren't good for everyone," Fonda acknowledged. "It's 
better to work out less intensely for a longer period of time. Now I do 
aerobics in a way that enables people who don't like to do a lot of jumping 
around to do aerobics." 
</P>
<P>
Those principles were incorporated in her 1986 "Low-Impact" tape. Her new tape 
is even more advanced, featuring both high-intensity (for advanced students) 
and low-impact aerobics, as well as exercises with weights. 
</P>
<P>
"For strength and contouring and to develop muscle tissue, doctors say you have 
to use weights," said Fonda, who also has a tape that strictly demonstrates 
dumbbell exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Her new tape, "Jane Fonda's Complete Workout," is based on interval training -- 
the latest thing in aerobics. "You start working at a low level and then you 
increase the intensity to get your pulse up," she explained. "Then you lower 
the intensity for a bit. That's when you're metabolizing fat. Then you increase 
the intensity of the exercising again." 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
"People have to make that decision for themselves," one home-video executive 
concluded. "There's good in both programs. As long as people are exercising -- 
doing something -- that's the important thing."

AIDS VIGIL CONTINUES ON COUNTY-USC PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On day six of a week-long vigil, about 30 AIDS patients and supporters stayed 
camped Thursday on the cement plaza in front of County-USC Medical Center in an 
attempt to call attention to a lack of public medical facilities designated for 
treatment of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Being close with those who are sympathetic to what AIDS patients are 
experiencing is what the vigil is about, said David Reid, a member of the AIDS 
Coalition To Unleash Power. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen community organizations have participated, Reid said. For each 
day of the vigil a different group designates an overnight watch crew and about 
30 people pass the nights together in tents, he said, adding that rallies 
during the day and "candlelight meditations" in the evenings have drawn groups 
of up to 350. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the vigil, talks between ACT UP and county supervisors have 
not produced any timetable for when money and facilities will be designated, 
Reid said. JOHN LEE

 ONE GOOD DEED WORTH $22,460 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retiree who was "just being a Good Samaritan" found $22,460 inside a phone 
booth at a Glendale car wash Thursday, then promptly turned in the cash to 
police, who returned it to its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Segal, a West Los Angeles man in his 60s, walked into the Northeast 
Division station about 1:15 p.m. and handed over two vinyl pouches filled with 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I found this in a phone booth. It's a lot of money," Officer Tom Okey quoted 
Segal as saying. "He was trembling," the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the money, mostly $100 and $50 bills, had been left on a shelf 
beneath a phone outside the California Car Wash by Albert Molina, 26, of 
Atwater, who reported he had misplaced it while his Porsche was being washed. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucky, lucky, lucky," Molina said. "This will be the last time I lose 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Molina, who owns a company that does immigration consulting work, said that he 
took the money out of a safe to buy furniture for a new business he is opening. 
He said he will give a $2,000 reward to Segal. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to call the police," Molina said. "I figured, 'Who is 
going to turn in so much cash?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. James Whitley said of Segal: "He was just being a Good Samaritan."

GALANTER BACKS YAROSLAVSKY FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has bucked council tradition by 
backing Laura Lake over fellow Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in the 5th District 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said of Lake, 
who played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman 
Pat Russell two years ago. Lake also took Galanter's mother into her home after 
Galanter was stabbed by an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter first endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September, when 
Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor. But 
Yaroslavsky earlier this month decided not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley and 
to run again for his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare, but not unheard of, for members of the city's small rather 
collegial body to endorse a challenger over an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter, "I 
understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it."

 MAN GETS 14 YEARS IN SCHOOL DRUG SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first person convicted in Los Angeles under the federal-local Schoolyard 
Law Program, aimed at stopping drug dealing close to schools, was sentenced 
Thursday to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Robinson, 30, identified by prosecutors as a member of a Los Angeles 
street gang known as the East Coast Crips, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge 
David Kenyon for selling a PCP-dipped cigarette to undercover police officers 
across the street from Bethune Junior High School in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The law went into effect in October, 1986, and provides heavier sentences for 
those convicted of selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school.

INDICTMENT IN SEARS FRAUD CASE REINSTATED

A federal appeals court on Thursday once again reinstated a criminal indictment

focus of a long-running battle between the appellate court and the chief 
federal judge in Los Angeles.

Sears -- which has been facing the on-again, off-again charges for nearly nine 
years -- was under indictment again this week after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals revived the case for the fourth time, rejecting arguments that the 
company's right to a speedy trial had been violated in the lengthy 
jurisprudential debate. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Manuel Real, the chief federal jurist in Los Angeles, had three times 
dismissed the indictment, siding with Sears' argument that the original 
prosecutor had badgered witnesses during grand jury proceedings before the 
indictment was returned against the retailer in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
After the third dismissal, the appeals court ordered Real to re-assign the case 
to another judge, saying his highly critical statements about the government 
prosecutor and his repeated dismissals were evidence of "an appearance of his 
unwillingness to preside in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Real, calling the reassignment order an assault on the independence of trial 
judges, appealed the order to the U.S. Supreme Court and gave up the case to 
Judge A. Andrew Hauk only after the high court refused to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hauk responded by dismissing the indictment yet again during the first hearing 
he set and by imposing monetary sanctions on the prosecution, which he later 
reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth time around now. How many warnings do you want?" Hauk asked 
Justice Department lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fourth Appeal Filed 
</P>
<P>
The government appealed for a fourth time, and with Thursday's order, prevailed 
yet again. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Betty B. Fletcher, writing for a three-member panel of the court, said 
government lawyers did not "unnecessarily delay" or violate the Speedy Trial 
Act when, faced with Real's refusal to reassign the case and being uncertain 
how to proceed, they failed to take official action to schedule the case for 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Hauk recognized that the government had contacted the district court 
twice in order to encourage the court to (officially accept the appeals court's 
reversal of the dismissal)," the court said. "Thus, Judge Hauk at most 
implicitly found that the government had been negligent in adopting a rather 
cautious approach in its efforts to persuade the court. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which involves events that occurred as long as 21 years ago, 
accuses Sears of concealing more than $1.1 million in rebates and credits that 
it had privately arranged with suppliers in Japan in order to avoid certain 
duties imposed by U.S. authorities on merchandise sold in this country for 
prices below those charged in their home market.

ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS RISE IN STATE, NATIONWIDE, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-Semitic incidents rose last year in California, and across the country for 
the second straight year, according to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
But in the category of vandalism against Jewish property, the numbers declined 
somewhat in California, largely because of vigorous prosecution of members of 
neo-Nazi "skinhead" gangs and other offenders, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions were announced in Los Angeles on Thursday by the league, which 
audited two categories of incidents -- vandalism against property and 
harassment of individuals -- in 40 states. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Lehrer, the league's regional director in Los Angeles, told a news 
conference that national incidents of vandalism -- including arson, bombings 
and swastika daubings -- increased by 18.5% last year, from 694 to 823 
incidents. Harassment of individual Jews, including telephone threats and 
assaults, he said, rose 41%, up from 324 incidents to 458 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Acts of vandalism in California decreased 12%, from 137 incidents in 1987 to 
121 last year, Lehrer said, but acts of harassment nearly doubled, rising from 
26 to 49. So overall, anti-Semitic incidents in the state rose from 163 acts in 
1987 to 170 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer pointed out, however, that the decrease in vandalism failed to 
counteract the 121% increase shown in California between 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents tallied in the report included arson at a Fullerton synagogue; bomb 
threats to synagogues in Fullerton and La Jolla; explosion of a pipe bomb on 
the grounds of a Florida synagogue, and the beating and stabbing of a 
19-year-old Yeshiva University student in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whom Lehrer credited partially for 
the decrease in vandalism here, said he disagreed with the idea that hate 
groups should be ignored because focusing attention on them only increases 
their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to deal with them is to jump on them at the very beginning," Reiner 
said. "You have to disrupt them and disorganize them and not give them the 
luxury of allowing them to organize." 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer said the arrest record for anti-Semitic offenders is improving, with 124 
arrests last year, compared to 78 nationally in 1987. Reiner said two such 
offenders were sent to prison last year in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Although the skinhead youth groups are growing, Reiner said: "It is one thing 
to be a member of a group and espouse a certain philosophy and another to act. 
Vigorous prosecution assures that their rhetoric won't be matched by their 
deeds." 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer attributed the overall increase in anti-Semitic acts last year to hatred 
stirred up by national and international events: 
</P>
<P>
* Growth of skinhead gangs, which the league claims has 2,000 members active in 
21 states. Forty-one incidents in 15 states last year were attributed to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
* The Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, which the group said 
sparked 117 incidents against Jews in the United States, including arson, bomb 
threats and phone or mail threats. 
</P>
<P>
* The 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Nazi destruction of synagogues and 
other Jewish property in Germany and Austria. More than 60 incidents occurred 
in the United States during that weeklong observance, the ADL said.

GOP ATTEMPT TO TAKE WRIGHT OFF COMMITTEE FAILS 
</P>

<P>
Assembly Republicans on Thursday failed to oust Assemblywoman Cathie Wright 
from her seat on the powerful Rules Committee, mustering only 25 of the 
required 41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
GOP lawmakers have sought to remove the Simi Valley Republican since early last 
month when she failed to join them in supporting the candidacy of a dissident 
Democrat challenging Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly floor vote Thursday was 25 to 1 to replace Wright on the committee 
with Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad). Wright was the only member to 
oppose Frazee, with 54 lawmakers, including all 46 Democrats, either not voting 
or absent. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has steadfastly refused to relinquish her seat on the Rules Committee, 
which oversees the housekeeping operations of the lower house and assigns bills 
to committees. After the vote, she declared the matter "closed. The vote has 
been taken. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointed by Move 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 59, who was elected to a fifth term in November, said that she was 
disappointed by the action of her colleagues but vowed that "it doesn't change 
my philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has had a widening political impact. On the local level, it has 
publicized the split between Wright and neighboring Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette (R-Northridge), who launched the effort to remove her GOP colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Wright maintained that her refusal to resign from the committee also sparked 
opposition Thursday to her bill to allow the Simi Valley Unified School 
District to raise its bonded indebtedness, as sought in a $35-million bond 
issue on the March 7 ballot. As a result, Assembly floor action on the bill was 
postponed until next week. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, lawmakers suggested that the Wright controversy is an example 
of how the lower house has become bogged down in internal housekeeping matters 
because of differences between Brown and new Republican Leader Ross Johnson 
(R-La Habra). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democratic Defense 
</P>
<P>
During the sometimes angry debate, Democrats defended Wright, a staunch 
conservative. For example, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), chairman of the 
Rules Committee, praised Wright as "an excellent member of the Rules 
Committee." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican action is "one of punishing her . . . because she refused to 
vote for a Democrat for Speaker," Bane said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Assembly began its current session, Wright abstained from voting for a 
new Speaker, claiming that she had told her constituents she would not vote for 
a Democrat. Most of her Republican colleagues supported Assemblyman Charles 
Calderon (D-Whittier), a member of the "Gang of Five" that challenged Brown's 
leadership last year. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson denied that the move to remove Wright was an effort to punish her for 
not supporting Calderon. He said that the central issue is whether a majority 
of the GOP members have a right to decide the Republican membership on 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that traditionally members of one party went along with Rules 
Committee choices of the other party. "That tradition for the first time has 
been broken," Johnson said. That assertion was later denied by Bane. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also expressed hope that the bitterness over Wright's Rules Committee 
seat "was not an indication of the kind of house we're going to have for the 
next two years." 
</P>
<P>
That prompted Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) to shout an expletive at 
Johnson, yelling "It's up to you." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Johnson said: "Well, Mr. Harris, it's up to all of us. It's up to 
all 80 of us. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Choice 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Republican caucus agreed to remove Wright from the 
committee. However, neither La Follette nor several other challengers could 
muster a majority of votes in the caucus to take the matter to the floor. On 
Thursday, Frazee emerged as a compromise choice to replace Wright. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Wright maintained that she encountered opposition to her Simi 
Valley schools bill because of her refusal to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that the legislation was identical to a bill that passed last year 
allowing the Simi Valley school district to extend repayment of state loans if 
local voters approved general-obligation bonds. As a result, school district 
officials were able to advertise that a vote for the bond was a vote for a 
tax-rate decrease. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, voters defeated the bond measure for renovations on existing 
school structures. The issue is scheduled to go before voters again in March. 
To again boost its chances, Wright has introduced similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa) branded the measure a "horrible piece of 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the controversy, Wright agreed to delay action until next week.

CROUCH TAKES HIS TV GOSPEL WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the sun was setting one day last spring in the San Joaquin Valley, the Rev. 
Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, began to preach his gospel of globalism. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch told the congregation in a sweltering sanctuary in rural Selma about 
TBN's plans to build a television station in Finland to broadcast into the 
Soviet Union. The 54-year-old minister then revealed that an agreement had been 
reached to exchange programming with the Central Television Authority of China. 
</P>
<P>
"The bamboo curtain is coming down!" Crouch told the cheering crowd of farmers 
and townsfolk gathered for the revival, as a mobile studio and satellite linkup 
outside the Cathedral of Light transmitted the message live across the country 
and, delayed, around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch, whose tax-exempt TBN television stations in the United States alone are 
worth an estimated half a billion dollars, is one of the hottest names in 
Christian television in areas as far afield as southern Africa and Central 
America, broadcasting in at least eight languages. 
</P>
<P>
Besides these two regions, TBN viewers around the United States, who pledged 
$56 million last year during the ministry's two major fund-raisers, have also 
helped Crouch build and operate 10 television stations in Italy, including a 
powerful VHF outlet in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch explains that his motivation in building television stations abroad is 
inseparable from his acquisition and construction of scores of outlets in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Christ said simply to his disciples, 'Go into all the world and preach this 
gospel to every creature, or every human being.' And common sense I guess tells 
you to use whatever means is at your disposal to do that, the most efficient 
way," Crouch said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Central America and the Caribbean, Crouch has been building outposts 
for his broadcasting empire, which is based in a modern studio and 
administrative complex in Tustin. Crouch also uses his live, coast-to-coast 
U.S. program to attack Marxist and leftist regimes abroad and their supporters 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
TBN has television stations operating or under construction on the islands of 
Grenada and St. Lucia and in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The 
silver-haired Crouch, who has repeatedly boasted that his plans are to 
"surround the Sandinistas with pincers, pincers of love," is regularly pictured 
in TBN's newsletter with military and right-wing figures in these countries, 
including some like El Salvador's Roberto D'Aubuisson, who have been charged 
with human-rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
In Central America, as in Italy, Protestant evangelicals like Crouch and Jimmy 
Swaggart have been challenging the primacy of the Catholic Church, particularly 
where the Catholic Church has aided those opposed to the established order. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent broadcast, Crouch said that the "liberation theology" espoused by 
some Catholics in Latin America is "basically a front for communism." Guests on 
Crouch's "Praise the Lord" talk show and other shows on TBN are vociferous 
supporters of U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
TBN's impact in Central America is still limited, according to Dennis Smith, 
coordinator of the Latin American Evangelical Center for Pastoral Studies in 
Guatemala City, mostly because the stations are UHF and require an antenna 
attachment for reception. 
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, TBN's influence is largely confined to middle-class, urban 
evangelicals, considered the fastest-growing segment of the population, Smith 
said. Although Swaggart appears on TBN, his influence in the region comes 
largely from buying commercial time on local VHF outlets, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, Crouch went to South Africa with a full TBN crew for a 3-day 
revival and a meeting with the country's president, P.W. Botha, to pursue plans 
to establish that country's first nationwide Christian broadcasting network. 
Encouraged by the government, Crouch has already built southern Africa's first 
Christian television station in the nominally independent black homeland of 
Ciskei. 
</P>
<P>
Groups as large as 10,000 people -- some of them schoolchildren bused in by the 
government -- took part in the televised Ciskei revival. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no apartheid in this room tonight!" Crouch told the mostly black 
crowd. "The partition has been broken down." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has repeatedly condemned apartheid as wrong and destined to end, while 
cautioning on a recent broadcast that "the way to end it is not burn the 
country down and promote terrorism and disinvestment. . . . The way to end 
apartheid is for the Christians to arise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1 Million Invested 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has invested $1 million, including a $50,000 donation from an 
unidentified "Hollywood film producer," in a million-watt UHF television 
station that was built and dedicated in Ciskei, one of several so-called tribal 
homelands set up by the South African government but not recognized by most 
other governments. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1970s, South Africa attempted to sell as a solution to white 
minority rule a policy of uprooting and "resettling" millions of black South 
Africans in tribal homelands like the Ciskei, Transkei and Bophuthatswana, 
which were to be granted nominal independence. 
</P>
<P>
But because few blacks agreed to move voluntarily to these areas, which were 
often barren and remote, the government unilaterally declared them aliens, 
forcibly removing them in large numbers from areas of South Africa where they 
had been born and lived for generations, and dumping them in the homelands. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Crouch told viewers recently: "The reason the little African homelands were 
developed by the South African government was to give a particular African 
tribe a piece of territory." 
</P>
<P>
To which his wife, Jan, added, "like the American Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has established a close relationship with the Ciskei government, 
addressing the Cabinet in 1985. In December of 1986, Cabinet members were flown 
from South Africa to Orange County to appear with Crouch and his wife on 
"Praise the Lord" during TBN's semiannual fund-raising telethon. Because the 
United States does not recognize the Ciskei, the government officials had to 
travel with South African passports. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's actions in support of the Botha government and the homelands policy 
were sharply criticized by Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a Washington 
lobbying organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The great earmark of apartheid is not the petty apartheid discrimination in 
white areas, but the grand apartheid of the land mass . . . the forcible 
relocation of rightful residents by the millions," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Ciskei station, local black ministers are invited to come in and tape a 
series of seven messages, according to Bernard Roebert, the white South African 
station manager. But the only two regular local programs are broadcasts of 
services of two of the largest and most conservative white churches in South 
Africa, one in Johannesburg and the other in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Roebert said that daytime programming on the station has been reserved for use 
by the Ciskei government -- considered corrupt and repressive by international 
human-rights organizations -- ostensibly for educational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
After returning last year from a televised crusade in Ciskei, Crouch told 
subscribers of the TBN newsletter that officials there "confirmed the fact that 
racial unrest and acts of terrorism had declined significantly" since the 
station went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Since establishing himself in Ciskei, Crouch has set his sights on gaining 
entry into South Africa's tightly controlled television market. He recently 
presented the government with a proposal for a $16-million nationwide Christian 
television network, linking the major cities of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban 
and Port Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-August of last year, Crouch told his U.S. viewers, he met with President 
Botha and the minister of information to push for government approval of the 
network. Botha was receptive but noncommittal, Crouch said, at one point urging 
him to broadcast his message to the black-ruled nations known as the "frontline 
states," which surround South Africa to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said he replied, "We will be happy to do that," asking: "Will you let us 
put our transmitters on safe South African soil and beam it up there under the 
protection of the armed forces of South Africa?" 
</P>
<P>
Botha said he would consider that, as well. Results were more definite when 
Crouch met with leaders of neighboring Bophuthatswana, who agreed to allow TBN 
to build another complete station, in exchange for providing regular time for 
the government to produce news shows. 
</P>
<P>
Homeland officials also implied they would permit the network to use other bits 
of territory scattered across South Africa to build relay towers to extend 
their signal. In the interim, the government agreed to air Crouch's "Praise" 
show once a week on BOP-TV, just as the state network in Transkei does. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a keen interest by a number of the churches" in the Crouch proposal, 
said Peet De Pontes, who represents the city of East London in South Africa's 
Parliament, mainly because Trinity is nondenominational and because Trinity 
"will in fact give time to any recognized church that seeks it." 
</P>
<P>
This equality of access, however, will be "purely on religious grounds," De 
Pontes said. "No political propaganda will be allowed, because it doesn't fit 
in with Trinity's philosophy."

LANDLORD SAYS TENANTS INSTALLED METAL BARS

<P>
Contrary to a neighbor's report, tenants -- not the landlord -- installed metal 
bars that rescuers said prevented them from saving Rachelle Jensen from a fire 
in her Stanton home Jan. 20, Laura Abbasi, wife of landlord Hossein Abbasi, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them to remove them because they were not safe, but they wanted to 
keep them up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For 7 years, the Jensens had rented an apartment in the four-unit building 
purchased a year and a half ago by Abbasi, she added.

The Jensens could not be reached for comment.

A fleeing suspect bit off more than he could chew -- or perhaps it was the 
other way around -- when he tried to fight off a police dog working with 
California Highway Patrol officers Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old suspect was taken to San Clemente General Hospital for 
treatment of dog bites on both thighs. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 6:47 p.m. when the CHP pursued a suspected drunk driver 
south on Interstate 5 in the Mission Viejo area, CHP Sgt. Dennis Dyer said. A 
check of the license plate indicated that the car was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect suddenly stopped in the freeway's center divider near Cristianitos 
Road and ran across the freeway lanes, almost getting hit, and into a large 
field near Camp Pendleton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP searched the field, assisted by helicopters from the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. A second helicopter from the Costa Mesa Police Department 
located the suspect by using infrared sensors that detected the suspect's body 
heat in the tall, dense brush, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Nick, a German shepherd police dog with the Sheriff's Department, 
was sent in. The suspect, identified as Fernandez Hernandez of Modesto, tried 
to fight off the dog. "He lost," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was arrested on suspicion of car theft and driving while intoxicated, 
Dyer said.

2 YOUTHS HELD AFTER CHASE IN STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers in a stolen car led officers on a chase from Santa Ana to Los 
Angeles early Thursday before the car spun out of control on Century Boulevard 
and the pair surrendered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana police office patrolling in the 2000 block of Southwood Street at 
about 2:45 a.m. saw two youths in a 1987 Hyundai that had been reported stolen 
from Irvine earlier in the evening, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas 
said. The youths ignored the officer's attempt to stop them, drove west on 
Warner Avenue and headed north on the San Diego Freeway, Thomas added. 
</P>
<P>
After a high-speed, 30-minute chase, the car spun out of control on Century 
Boulevard after leaving the freeway. No one was injured, and the car was not 
damaged. The youths, ages 15 and 16 and both from Santa Ana, were arrested on 
suspicion of possession of stolen property, evading arrest and reckless 
driving.

LOS ALAMITOS CENTER NAMED FOR DOCTOR; 
</P>
<P>
NOTED BRAIN SPECIALIST JOHN FRENCH DIES AT 77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Douglas French, a founder of the UCLA Brain Research Institute, died 
Wednesday at the Los Alamitos Alzheimer's disease care facility that bears his 
name. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
His personal battle with Alzheimer's disease took on public overtones when his 
wife, diva Dorothy Kirsten, began a lengthy campaign to house those with the 
affliction. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in November, 1987, the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's 
Disease was the nation's first facility designed and built to care for those 
affected by the degenerative brain disease. 
</P>
<P>
French's wife, who once was the definitive "Madame Butterfly" at the 
Metropolitan Opera Co., has said that when her husband was diagnosed as having 
Alzheimer's in 1982, there was no suitable facility for his care. She embarked 
on a campaign to build one. 
</P>
<P>
She created the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research to advance scientific 
and medical research and to provide methods for caring for America's 3 million 
Alzheimer's patients. The center was built through the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
French's fate was ironic, since he was a physician who devoted most of his 
career to the mysteries of brain disease. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Los Angeles, he earned his medical degree at USC and received 
additional training in neurosurgery in the East. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1940s, French directed the residence program in neurosurgery at 
Long Beach Veteran's Hospital. There, he met Prof. H.W. Magoun, with whom he 
later co-founded the UCLA Brain Research Institute. He served as its director 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
French's research focused primarily on brain mechanisms related to epilepsy, 
comas, anesthesia, sleep and wakefulness. 
</P>
<P>
He and Kirsten married in 1955 and they often traveled together; he to attend 
medical meetings, she to sing in performances. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible to watch this beautiful man deteriorate before my eyes," she 
said at the 148-bed center on the eve of its opening. "But I'm very pleased 
that he will finish his days here." 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at the Bel Air Presbyterian Church at 2:30 p.m. 
Monday. His wife has asked that in lieu of sending flowers, memorial 
contributions be made to the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research, 11620 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 260, Los Angeles, Calif. 90025.

COURT SAYS DAD MUST POSE HARM TO BE DENIED VISITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for parental rights advocates, an appellate court ruled Thursday 
that a father must pose an actual harm to his child -- not merely show 
negligence -- to be denied his fundamental visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
The finding came as the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, reversing a 
lower court, restored visitation rights to an unidentified Costa Mesa man who 
had failed to see his young son for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Legal specialists in family law called the decision an important declaration 
that a parent's right to see a child is an essential one that cannot be 
dismissed haphazardly unless there is a clear danger to the child. But experts 
differed over how the ruling fits into current family law trends -- some seeing 
it as a clear break, others as a continuation of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Orange County mother in the dispute, identified for reasons of 
confidentiality as Beverly S., went to court to have her current husband adopt 
her son and to deny the boy's birth father -- her ex-husband -- any visitation 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
She charged that the ex-husband, identified by the court as Scott C., had in 
effect abandoned 7-year-old Jason because of his sporadic visits and through 
his failure to pay child support while unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis agreed. Finding that the father had failed 
to exercise his visitation rights for 13 months, with the exception of a single 
"token" appearance, the judge cut off the father's visits. 
</P>
<P>
But in an opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin and released Thursday, 
the 4th District Court of Appeal faulted that decision. The court ruled that 
the father's negligence alone could not justify the severe step of cutting off 
visitation rights altogether; the parent must pose an actual harm to the child. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to effect such a drastic result without first requiring a 
finding that the continuation of Scott's rights would be detrimental to Jason," 
the court ruled. "No evidence was presented to show this." 
</P>
<P>
The court said its adherence to this higher standard is designed "to safeguard 
parental rights." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Testa, president of an Orange County support and legal counsel group 
called Fathers United For Equal Justice, called the decision an important 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The message that's being sent here is that it is in the best interests of a 
child to see and be with his father," Testa said. 
</P>
<P>
Testa and others active in fathers' rights issues argue that negligence cannot 
be used to justify cutting off visits, because often it is the mother who 
prevents the father from seeing his child. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley L. Albaum, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in family law and 
represented the father in the case that was the subject of Thursday's ruling, 
characterized the decision as "bucking the trend" of recent legal rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as the only clear ruling in the 4th District -- even in the state -- 
to say that a finding of detriment to the child is needed (to sever 
visitation); a benign harm won't do it."

CIVIL RIGHTS UNIT REJECTS COMPLAINT OVER HANDICAPPED BUSING SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a 3-month investigation, the federal Office of Civil Rights has 
determined that the Orange County Department of Education responded adequately 
last fall to a bus shortage for handicapped students and did not violate their 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agency said the county department "is currently in compliance" with 
a U.S. law requiring free transportation of the handicapped, and the agency 
dismissed a civil rights complaint against the department. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Education, which governs the $50-million budget for 
the County Department of Eduction, learned of the action at its regular 
Thursday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Palomino, regional civil rights director for the U.S. Office of Civil 
Rights in San Francisco, notified the department that "based upon the action 
taken by the Orange County Department of Education to provide emergency 
transportation to improve the service already provided and to provide 
supplemental instruction to compensate for instructional time lost, the Office 
of Civil Rights finds the (county department) is currently in compliance." 
</P>
<P>
But Rhys Burchill, executive director of Developmental Disabilities Area Board 
XI, the panel that filed the civil rights complaint, said Thursday that her 
group is still checking on how the Orange County Department of Education 
provides transportation for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely the crisis is over, but there still seem to be sporadic problems, 
and when these problems surface, we inform the County Department of Education 
of our concern," Burchill said. 
</P>
<P>
Her group is a watchdog agency for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, many buses taking handicapped students to special schools in 
the county stopped regular service, at one point stranding up to half the 800 
handicapped students served by the County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The bus service bogged down because of a dispute between the contractor, Durham 
Transportation Inc. of Rosemead, and the department. Durham officials claimed 
that the department was not paying enough. The department claimed that it was 
paying what the contract called for and that Durham was deliberately refusing 
to fulfill its contract for buses. 
</P>
<P>
During the dispute, scores of parents complained that they had no regular 
transportation for their handicapped children. As a result, Developmental 
Disabilities Area Board XI on Sept. 20 filed a civil rights complaint against 
the County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law, which is enforced through the Office of Civil Rights, requires 
public school districts to provide free bus service to handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 7, Robert Peterson, Orange County superintendent of schools, announced 
that he was canceling Durham's contract, effective June 30, and that a new bus 
contractor will be sought. In the meantime, Peterson said, other buses and 
taxis will supplement Durham in providing service through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also said the department will provide makeup schooling for students 
who missed classes because of bus shortages.

ANOTHER DEAD SEA LION FOUND -- TOLL NOW 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another dead sea lion washed ashore in Huntington Beach on Thursday, and a 
federal official said the new body brings to 12 the number of the dead sea 
lions found in the coastal city since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of deaths still is a mystery, said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist 
with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 12 sea lion bodies that have been found so far, only two are suspected 
of having bullet wounds," Cordaro said. "And we can't prove that those two 
deaths were because of bullet wounds. It's very hard to distinguish bullet 
wounds from bird bites in dead sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen discovered the latest dead sea lion on the beach near Golden West 
Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway about 11:30 a.m. Thursday, said Judi Jones, 
operations director of Friends of the Sea Lion Marine Mammal Center in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jones believes that many of the sea lions have been killed by people in boats. 
"There are too many deaths occurring in too short a time and all at the same 
place for this to be a coincidence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro, however, said it is possible that a sea lion disease is responsible 
for the deaths. He said a 1984 outbreak of a liver-kidney disease affecting sea 
lions killed hundreds of the mammals in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said only 21 dead sea lions were found in all of Orange County in 1988, 
compared to 12 found in less than a week this year in Huntington Beach. Of the 
21 dead sea lions in 1988, six apparently were shot to death, six died of 
illnesses, and nine died of unknown causes, Cordaro said. 
</P>
<P>
The string of sea lion deaths in Huntington Beach was first reported to the 
National Marine Fisheries Service on Jan 19. Cordaro said an initial tally 
showed seven deaths, but that subsequent record checks turned up a total of 11 
sea lion deaths since Saturday -- all in the Huntington Beach area. The new sea 
lion body found Thursday raises the total to 12, he said.

OCEAN VIEW'S NORMAN PICKS NOTRE DAME

<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Norman, an all-Sunset League linebacker the past 2 seasons at Ocean View 
High School, has made a oral commitment to attend Notre Dame in the fall, 
Norman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, 6 feet 6 inches and 245 pounds, led Ocean View in tackles with 95 last 
season and was a second-team Times' all-county selection. He also played 
offensive guard but was being recruiting as a linebacker. Norman also had 
considered USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Norman also is a standout on the basketball team. He is averaging 21.4 points 
and 11 rebounds for the Oilers (13-6 overall, 3-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Norman had taken trips to national champion Notre Dame and to USC the last 2 
weekends. He was planning to go to visit UCLA this weekend, but canceled the 
trip after picking Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"My visit was what did it," Norman said. "It's a beautiful campus and area, and 
they have the football tradition going again. I'm ready to try something new. 
I'm leaving a nice area to go to a nice area." STEVE KRESAL

<P>
Speaking of Daum-Johnstown, its troubled parent -- Dallas real estate investor 
Southmark Corp. -- is in the news again. 
</P>
<P>
The company still owes a whopping $2 billion after going on a spending spree in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Many company watchers suspect that Southmark may soon start selling some of its 
jewels, like J.M. Peters Co. Inc. -- the immensely profitable Newport Beach 
home builder of which Southmark is majority owner -- and perhaps even less 
stellar performers such as Los Angeles-based Daum-Johnstown. 
</P>
<P>
Or Southmark itself could be acquired. Southmark says that it has had inquiries 
from "many organizations," some of them -- the company suspects -- looking for 
fire-sale prices. 
</P>

A spokesman for Peters says the home-building company still hasn't been told 
what its fate will be. A small chunk of Peters is already traded publicly, and 
Southmark put the rest on the block last year, but a deal with Denver's MDC 
Holdings Inc. fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur G. Weiss, the new Southmark chairman, said in a letter to shareholders 
Thursday that he had begun reviewing the company's tattered financial condition 
and that any decision on the sale "must await the completion of the 
examination." 
</P>
<P>
But it apparently was rumors of a sale at Daum-Johnstown last fall that helped 
push the 50 or so employees in Orange County to defect en masse to Scher-Voit.

Another group of old Daum-Johnstown employees has missed all the excitement. 
They left in 1983 to start Collins Fuller Corp., a Newport Beach-based 
commercial broker. 
</P>
<P>
That company said recently that Michael Collins has moved up to president. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces his father and the firm's founder, James E. Collins, who remains 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The two executives and in-law Richard H. Fuller now have offices in Los 
Angeles, Orange County and the Inland Empire 5 years after leaving Daum, an 
old-line broker of industrial buildings founded in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
Daum was bought in 1984 by Johnstown American in Atlanta, which in turn was 
acquired by Southmark on one of its spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
Collins Fuller is one of about a dozen smaller brokerages in Orange County that 
are trying to grab business away from big guys like Coldwell Banker and Grubb 
&amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the old Daum Corp. did, the new brokerage specializes in industrial 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still following all this, it gets even more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Collins Fuller recently announced that it had hired Daum-Johnstown's former 
president, Joseph J. Sojka, to run its new Gardena office. 
</P>
<P>
Sojka left Daum-Johnstown last fall during the broker stampede under 
circumstances that the company would not comment on.

UCI MANAGEMENT DEAN ELECTED TO MERCURY S&amp;L BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis J. Aigner, dean of the UC Irvine Graduate School of Management, has been 
elected to the board of directors at Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to UCI from USC in mid-August, Aigner has said he wanted to foster 
closer ties between the management school and the county's business world. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a very explicit way of putting into practice what I preach," he 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L is the first county company to tap Aigner for a board position. In 
October, he was elected to the board of the Industrial League of Orange County, 
made up of about 900 county companies, which addresses business issues. 
</P>
<P>
The contacts he makes with local executives, Aigner said, should help the 
management school's students earn spots as interns or permanent employees with 
the companies. And he expects to bring to the school top executives "to talk to 
students about the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Aigner said he has not solicited his new board positions. He said his public 
comments about wanting to get involved in the business community prompted the 
Industrial League to seek him out. And he got to know Mercury's chairman, 
Leonard Shane, through Shane's work as a member of the chancellor's UCI Chief 
Executive Roundtable and the management school's policy committee. 
</P>
<P>
A professor of management and economics, Aigner, 51, was credited with vastly 
upgrading USC's economics department as its head for 9 years before coming to 
UCI. He taught for 10 years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and for 5 
years at the University of Illinois before going to USC. 
</P>
<P>
Besides electing Aigner to the board, Mercury's directors also designated two 
longtime board members as directors emeritus, a semi-retirement position that 
carries all the rights and privileges of board members except the right to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
They are Dr. Masami Ogata, who had been on the board since Mercury opened its 
doors in 1964, and Sidney Title, who has been on the board for nearly 25 years.

BALLET SERIES HELPS CENTER'S PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Center for the Performing Arts finished 1988 nearly $500,000 
ahead of budget projections, fueled by one of "the most successful ballet 
series in the country" and an increase in single ticket sales, according to 
Center President Thomas R. Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
Response to the ballet series proved not only that Orange County audiences "are 
great admirers of ballet" but that this is "a far more cosmopolitan region than 
is sometimes ascribed," said Henry T. Segerstrom, chairman of the Center board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
After the regular quarterly meeting of the Center's board, Kendrick and 
Segerstrom discussed the results of the Center's preliminary 1988 financial 
report. An operating loss of $4.8 million had been projected, but the loss was 
only $3.2 million, putting it $1.6 million ahead of projections, Segerstrom 
said. In 1987, he added, the Center's operating loss was $900,000 less than had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
However, 1988 projections for revenue from organizations and individuals 
supporting the Center, which had been budgeted at $2.5 million, fell short by 
$1.1 million. Kendrick said this shortfall resulted partially from the 
diversion of $150,000 from one support organization to the Center's endowment 
fund. Also, a grant from the Steele Foundation, up to $750,000 to support the 
New York City Opera in 1988, was awarded after Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the $1.6 million resulting from an operating loss that 
was less than projected and the $1.1 million shortfall in support -- just under 
$500,000 -- will be transferred to the Center's endowment fund, Segerstrom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We always start from the premise of a balanced budget," Kendrick said, 
repeatedly characterizing last year's results as "extraordinary." Practically, 
he said, "we can't expect that to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the ballet season of "6 solid weeks" and "five outstanding 
companies" drew a paid audience of 85.4% of the Center's capacity, well above 
the national average, enabling the Center to "break even" on the 44 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick announced that paid attendence for programming presented by the Center 
rose from 83.1% in 1987 to 85.4% in 1988. The number of Center-sponsored 
performances went from 88 to 122, Kendrick said, producing a jump in attendance 
from 232,771 to 324,705. 
</P>
<P>
When included with performances sponsored by regional groups that use the 
Center, however, the percentage of overall paid attendance at the Center dipped 
slightly, from 79.1% in 1987 to 78% in 1988. Kendrick said he was "very 
pleased" that the drop was as small as it was.

UNINHIBITED COMPOSER LETS UCI AUDIENCE HELP CREATE PIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the great classical tradition extending from Bach to at least Liszt, Daniel 
Lentz composed a work on the spot for his audience Wednesday at the Fine Arts 
Gallery at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But the composer's working methods would probably have surprised his 
predecessors. This same man was fired from UC Santa Barbara in 1969 for asking 
two naked people to simulate intercourse underneath a grand piano as part of a 
piece called "Love and Conception." Also, his "Kissing Song" did not debut as 
scheduled in 1978 because the singers objected to sliding their tongues in and 
out of each other's mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz, who is from Los Angeles, seems to have calmed down since then, though, 
and has gone the route of the minimalists. Wednesday night, he asked for a 
phrase of eight to 12 syllables to serve as a text of a piece for soprano and 
keyboard. Suggestions from the 60-member audience were not exactly inspired 
("UCI Fine Arts Gallery" and "I am a poor, wayfaring stranger"). The 
46-year-old composer settled on "Why write music on Saturday?" 
</P>
<P>
He then called for rules to write by (remember Robert Frost's saying, that 
writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down?), and settled on 
three: Stick to three chords (E-flat minor, F-sharp minor and F minor), a time 
signature of 5/4, and a brisk tempo of 126 quarter beats per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he turned to a blackboard and got to work while his wife, soprano Jessica 
Lowe, talked about his composing methods, which involve sung word games based 
on adding or subtracting tiny bits of syllables called phonemes. For example, 
in the one-syllable words tip and dip, the t and d are the phonemes that 
distinguish them. Composers have been exploring the use of phonemes since at 
least the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In the "additive" method used by Lentz, his wife sang a line of scat-like 
phonemes that were tape-recorded and instantly played back over her next vocal 
line, which varied from the first. 
</P>
<P>
As the process continued several times, the soloist appeared to become a 
"duet," "trio," "quartet" and so on, until finally the desired sentence 
emerged, as if by magic. Meanwhile, all kinds of other "allusive" words and 
meanings could be heard along the way, enriching the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz and Lowe also demonstrated a "subtractive" approach, with a tape 
recording that began with a jumble of sounds that were successively filtered 
until the sought-after sentence could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
The "Why write music on Saturday?" piece composed on the spot by Lentz 
Wednesday didn't work out quite as neatly as some more complex recorded works 
he played to the audience (in one of them, he had been able to simulate the 
sound of a large cathedral choir by overlapping voices). Timing, which has to 
be split-second, seemed to pose the biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
But it did offer an audience a chance to be an active participant at a 
classical concert, something that rarely occurs today. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz was the third of four contemporary composers-musicians speaking this 
month at the Fine Arts Gallery. John King, a composer from Los Angeles, will 
complete the series Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free. Information: (714) 
856-6610.

COUNTY'S AKIYAMAS HAVE BEEN RAISING 'LIVING JEWELS' SINCE THE 1920S 
</P>

The pond churned in a Technicolor boil. Big, gaping fish mouths surged to the 
surface as Joseph Akiyama cast feed pellets on the water. The splashing 
increased. The vivid colors of the koi -- red, black, white, gold and metallic 
black -- became a blur. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll eat a lot," Akiyama sighed, the gurgle of a waterfall at his goldfish 
farm almost drowning out his soft voice. "It's a good thing their teeth are in 
their throats," added his wife, Sumie. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a pretty sight, but as Akiyama points out, people are not buying 
table manners when they buy these spectacularly colored creatures -- top 
specimens of which fetch $150,000 in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an awful lot of money for a fish," Akiyama, 65, said chuckling. 
"They're paying for prestige, I imagine. Must be a beautiful fish. Has to be." 
</P>
<P>
So, if they want to eat like pigs, let 'em. 
</P>
<P>
The Akiyamas know their goldfish, or Carassius aratus. The family can spin 
quite a fish story, beginning and maybe soon ending here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama's father is credited with introducing koi to Southern California 
shortly after World War I, according to Robert Spindola, head of the Nishiki 
Koi Club of Orange County. (In Japanese, the fish is called Nishikigoi, or 
"living jewel.") 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1888, the year before this area was even called Orange County, Kiyomi 
Henry Akiyama decided to leave the family farm in the mountains north of Tokyo 
just as he was about to be drafted into the Imperial Army. With a life's 
savings of 300 yen, he sailed in 1904 at the age of 16 for America and 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
He first worked as a field laborer and began raising goldfish as a hobby, 
specimens he had shipped in from Japan. By the 1920s, he was raising the fish 
full time on his own 40-acre farm -- first in Huntington Beach and then in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama recalled his father -- who died in March at age 100 -- loading an old 
pickup truck with barrels of goldfish and driving up to Los Angeles to sell his 
swimming rainbows door to door at pet shops. 
</P>
<P>
This booming success attracted a handful of imitators, mostly Nisei families, 
who also set up ponds in Westminster, Akiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, so many of the finny creatures were raised in Westminster that 
the city post office canceled stamps with the mark: "Goldfish Capital of the 
World," Akiyama said. That self-promoting slogan continued on some city post 
cards until the 1960s, even as the farms were gobbled up by shopping malls, 
freeways and land speculators. 
</P>
<P>
"It all stopped when land prices started going up," Akiyama said. "Land prices 
and property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Tucked today into a lot on Golden West Street off the San Diego Freeway, the 
Pacific Goldfish Farm once spread over what is now Westminster Mall. About 
10,000 goldfish and koi paddle around in 20,000 gallons of circulating fresh 
water on about 1 acre. That's a lot of sushi, and the public can call the farm 
for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Because there's no longer enough room to raise the fish, Akiyama imports them 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Air freight is a delicate operation. A goldfish broker in Tokyo collects the 
creatures from around Japan. The broker places the fish gently in 30-gallon 
plastic bags with infusions of oxygen the day Akiyama calls in an order and 
whisks the sealed cargo to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The fish are starved for several days so they won't foul their water with too 
many droppings. For such insatiable appetites, that must certainly be the most 
arduous aspect of the trans-Pacific journey. 
</P>
<P>
Within 24 hours of his first telephone call to the Tokyo broker, Akiyama takes 
the fish from Los Angeles International Airport into his farm tanks. "Sometimes 
they look shocked," he said, but a meal and medication quickly right their 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable of his fish are the koi (pronounced coy), which make up half 
the farm's piscine stock, Akiyama said. But he sells mostly to hobbyists, not 
to the koi elite. For $500, a buyer could walk off with Akiyama's best 
red-and-white Kohaku. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we're not that much into expensive kois," Akiyama said. "This way we reach 
more people." 
</P>
<P>
Koi are special, he said, and tend to be coddled by owners. If ill, these 
creatures -- which can be worth more than their weight in caviar, sometimes 
have surgery performed on them. 
</P>
<P>
But koi return their owners' attention, Akiyama said. "They can associate 
sounds with feeding time. They seem to know when the door (outside to the farm 
tanks) opens." 
</P>
<P>
One koi fancier tells a story about when he left his ailing ornamental carp 
with a fish doctor for a month. The fish darted across the pond so fast when 
the owner returned that he never saw the creature begging at his feet. The fish 
doctor had to point the frantic koi out. 
</P>
<P>
Koi have long enjoyed a colorful tradition, revered over the centuries by 
emperors and nobility as ornamental pets. Said to have originated in Persia and 
Pakistan 2,500 years ago, koi were brought across the Asian steppes with 
Ghengis Khan to China in the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
From China, they migrated to Japan, where they became and remained a national 
passion. Indeed, the national fish is the nishikigoi. Each year on Boy's Day 
(May 5), carp flags called koinboiri fly as a symbol of strength and courage. 
</P>
<P>
Koi can grow up to 4 feet in length, said Spindola of the koi club, 
particularly in Japan where size increases value. And females are the most 
treasured because they are larger than males. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, however, Spindola said the males are the most popular 
"because they have much better color and are prettier when they're young. A 
female in the koi world is very fat and large, like a Rubens painting of a 
beautiful woman. Big, rotund giant things." 
</P>
<P>
While koi generally live about 20 years, some have been known to outlive their 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago the oldest-known koi, Hanoko, died at age 226 in Tokyo. 
Published obituaries actually traced back in time all the families who had 
owned the scaly Methuselah. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama said one of the koi his father first raised 60 years ago may still be 
swimming in an Orange County pond. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up on a fish farm, however, has reduced some of the charm koi inspire 
in so many others, Akiyama said. Now he is even considering "any good offers" 
on the farm -- none of his children wanted to continue the family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired," he said, leaning up against the counter in the fishery 
supplies store that fronts the ponds. "It gets stressful at times -- all these 
living things to keep alive." 
</P>
<P>
Goldfish stress may be unique to Akiyama. 
</P>
<P>
Many fish end up in dentist, doctor and tax-preparer offices for their reputed 
powers to calm jangled nerves, Sumie Akiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people out there truly enjoy them," she said. "And koi ponds create 
tranquillity. It fits into the California life style. So soothing."

LOCAL STATION AIRS A KID SHOW THAT'S REALLY A KID SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NEEDHAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mixed in with the children's programming Saturday mornings is a radio show with 
a surprisingly different approach: It actually has children as co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Media veterans despite their ages, 10-year-old Matthew Cole and his 8-year-old 
sister, Kimberly, slip into the studio at radio station KPZE in Anaheim at 7 
a.m. and spend the next hour weaving jokes, skits, news reports, song 
introductions and lead-ins to commercials over the 10,000-watt station. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley siblings get considerable help from co-host David Hare, who 
dreamed up the idea of having children as hosts of the program he dubbed "K.KID 
radio." Hare produces the show and sells spots to advertisers, then buys air 
time from the station to broadcast his program. 
</P>
<P>
Hare, who is just 21 himself, described the program as a natural evolution of 
the work he and his wife, Tammy, had been doing for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
The two had created a rabbit character called Hubble Hare for several 
family-oriented stage shows they performed in California during the Easter and 
Christmas holidays and summer vacations, Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, "we decided we needed something consistent," he said. "Jokingly 
I said, 'We could do a kids' radio show, because nobody's doing that.'. . . 
After several investigations of what kids want and are looking for, we came up 
with the format of K.KID radio," which took to the airwaves about 9 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
One of the children who responded to Hare's auditions for co-hosts was Matthew, 
whom Hare had seen as a guest and sometime-host on a KDOC-TV show for children. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew's "enthusiasm was incredible," Hare remembered. As a bonus, he had a 
sister who could also be host of the radio show and had appeared on the TV show 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
On one recent Saturday, Matthew introduced a song "from the loveable 
Chipmunks," and Kimberly, with only a minor glitch in tongue twister land, said 
it would soon be time for "Hubbel's Hot Spotlight." Songs ranged from 
"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" to a ditty from the movie "Mary Poppins" and the staple of 
decades gone by, "Mairzy Doats." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Matthew told his sister that "to sit in the presence of greatness 
is a special privilege that has been given just to you." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you're right, Matt," Kimberly replied. "We should thank Hubble for 
letting us sit in his presence." 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking about me," Matthew answered. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the show, Kimberly told listeners that "you're tuned in to the 
sweetest, most adorable show anywhere. So play tea party and listen to K.KID 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
That prompted her brother to reply: "What are you saying? This show is sweet 
and adorable? It's cool, radical and jammin', dude." 
</P>
<P>
That led to Kimberly's conclusion: "Face it, Matt. I'm a little bit country and 
you're a little bit rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew and Kimberly are not as concerned about the occasional overly cute 
dialogue as they are about the nightmare of all broadcasters: dead air. 
</P>
<P>
On one show, Hare could not do the rabbit character, leaving Matthew nonplussed 
partway through the hour. "I was saying, 'Are you having fun, Kim? Yes, we're 
having a great time, right, Kim? We're having fun, Kim. Yes, Kim, we're having 
fun, Kim.' 'Cause I didn't know really what to do. Then my sister said (in a 
loud whisper), 'Get to a song.' So I said, 'Let's get to a song.' " 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time, the youngsters simply have a good time. Matthew rated the 
best part of the show "just talking" and waiting for Hare to say, "Make up 
something, be creative." When that happens, "we get to be creative and make up 
a line. Then we get to talk sometimes, just on our own. He says go ahead and 
talk, so we do." 
</P>
<P>
About what? "Things that are happening, in school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, what's your school doing?" Kim said. "What's special? What holidays are 
you having?" 
</P>
<P>
Matthew can come up with interesting news easily partly because of his other 
job: "cub reporter" for a children's newspaper, "Bear Essential News for Kids." 
A reporter for the paper for the last year and a half, Matthew got an up-close 
look at Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson during a summer 
campaign stop in San Pedro and recently interviewed Newport Beach resident 
James Roosevelt on what it is like to be the son of a President. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew did so well as a reporter that the newspaper last year had him tell its 
new "reporters" what to expect. "I talked about the Bear Essential press pass 
and how far it can get you," Matthew said. "Most people think that a kid, I 
mean, they won't let you in anything. But if you have that press pass, it's 
like you're grown up, you're another person, you're really important." 
</P>
<P>
"Bear Essential News" is a monthly newspaper published by an Arizona couple, 
Sharon and Anson Wong, that is distributed free to schools in parts of Orange 
County and in Phoenix and Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at children ages 6 to 13, the newspaper carries short items on events 
such as earthquakes, Soviet troop strength cuts and the popularity of comic 
books in Japan. Student reporters write items on topics such as New Year's 
resolutions, the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. and animals that hibernate. 
</P>
<P>
The Coles' mother, Nancy, said she didn't know of any other radio programs in 
the country with children as co-hosts. "It's a neat thing," she said. "There's 
no kids' radio like K.KID." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying not to make (the program) so silly a parent doesn't want to 
listen to it," Hare said, so there are "special segments for parents on kids' 
fashions and what kids are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Hare, who grew up in Irvine and went to Fullerton College, hopes someday to 
syndicate the program across the United States. Hare produced shows for 
Melodyland church in Anaheim. His wife, Tammy, used to direct the children's 
choir at the Anaheim Assembly of God church, where her father is pastor.

BUSH VOWS TO PROTECT S&amp;L DEPOSITS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT DOESN'T EXPECT 'SWEETNESS AND HARMONY' ON FEE ISSUE

President Bush, holding his first news conference today, vowed to protect 
deposits in the troubled savings and loan industry, but sidestepped a proposal 
to tax depositors to raise the money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping into the White House press room on only about 20 minutes notice, Bush 
responded to the raging controversy that erupted during his first week in 
office over an Administration proposal -- called a tax by critics and a 
"premium" by the White House -- to charge depositors a 25- to 30-cent fee per 
$100 in deposits to raise the estimated $100 billion needed to save the S&amp;L 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little absurd to be commenting on a facet, a possible facet, of 
solving a problem when it hasn't even come to me," he said. "You're talking 
about speculating on something that hasn't even reached the desk of the 
President, even as an option." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the furor that accompanied word of the plan, admitted at 
the White House to be a "trial balloon," he said "that doesn't mean any 
thinking along those lines should cease." 
</P>
<P>
"Anything I do on savings and loans . . . I don't expect it's all going to be 
sweetness and harmony and light," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments, part of a 42-minute wide-ranging session with reporters, came 
amid criticism that he was abandoning his no-tax pledge in even floating the 
idea. But he reiterated that he was determined to deal with the industry's 
crisis, and said he was prepared for the many battles that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings and loans deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the 
government and they are sound, they are good, dollar good . . . and nothing is 
going to change in that regard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The informal news conference, the first of Bush's presidency, came as a result 
of his decree that he would take no shouted questions from reporters and the 
promise instead of more assorted forums to meet with the media. 
</P>
<P>
His voice raspy from a cold, he pronounced his first week a good one, telling 
reporters, "There's still a wonder to it all but no surprises." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was fully prepared for the honeymoon to end soon, and looked forward 
to battles not only on the savings and loan question but on his efforts to 
reduce the federal deficit, which go in first form to Congress on Feb. 9 when 
he addresses a joint session. 
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any intervention on his part over former President Reagan's 
decision to increase congressional pay 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"I do support it. A raise is overdue, there is no question about that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy front, Bush said he was committed to moving forward in 
all areas -- "all of them" -- but added that he could not predict where his 
first action would come. "It does take a little time. I've only been here a 
little less than a week." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was committed to moving the U.S.-Soviet relationship forward, but 
again took a cautious tone. "Let's take our time, let's take a look at where we 
stand," he said.

"This looks like a construction site!" roared Milton Williams, deputy chief

and about 80 reporters, producers, photographers and camera crews that have 
been covering the 13-week-long trial which has become a national symbol of 
child abuse.

The judge in the Iran-Contra criminal case said today he has the legal power to 
force former President Reagan and President Bush to testify at the trial of 
ex-White House aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell put off any decision on whether to 
throw out the defense subpoenas, which have been challenged by government 
lawyers as unprecedented. They argued that Reagan and Bush enjoy executive 
privilege and cannot be forced to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the power of the court to require testimony of Reagan or Bush, I do 
not think there is any question," Gesell ruled from the bench. "I have no doubt 
of the naked power if I have to use it."

Baseball's controversial balk rule, which created havoc for pitchers during the 
1988 season and led to a 160% increase in balks, is being scrapped for the 1989 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Major League Baseball Players Assn., which accepted the rule last spring on 
a one-year trial basis, has decided to block it for this season. The Official 
Playing Rules Committee decided to go back to the old rule, which said pitchers 
must come to a "complete stop" instead of a "complete and discernible stop." A 
record 924 balks were called in 1988. The previous record was 356 in 1987.

The Colgate-Palmolive Co. will change the name of its Darkie toothpaste, a 
best-selling brand in Asia, and redesign the label depicting a grinning black 
minstrel, company officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The toothpaste, which is not sold in the United States, will be renamed Darlie 
and the label will be changed to a "non-racially offensive silhouette" of a man 
clad in a top hat, tuxedo and bow tie, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The toothpaste's name and package had been basically unchanged since the 
product was launched in the 1920s by the Hawley &amp; Hazel Group, said 
officials of Colgate, which bought half ownership of the group for $50 million 
in 1985.

LEGENDARY AVIATOR SOPWITH DIES AT 101

Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, the adventure-loving creator of the World 
War I Sopwith Camel and Pup airplanes, died today. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, born in 1888 into a wealthy engineering family, 
was 16 when the Wright brothers flew under power for the first time in the 
United States. He taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing airplanes 
at age 26. Sopwith, who was an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman 
before he discovered his passion for airplanes, set several early flying 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of crashes in those days but, bless you, it was fun," he recalled 
on his 100th birthday last year. "This new experience of flying was one of the 
most exhilarating things that had ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 Sopwith airplanes were built for action in World War I, 
including 6,000 Camels, which shot down more enemy aircraft than any other 
allied plane. A Camel flown by Roy Brown shot down the German Baron Von 
Richthofen, the infamous "Red Baron."

The stock market ran up another strong gain in heavy trading today, capping off 
the best week so far in a rally that began more than two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 31.79 to 2,322.86, bringing its 
gain for the week to 87.50 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 254.87 million shares, against 212.25 million in the 
previous session. The NYSE's composite index gained 1.18 to 164.78. 
</P>
<P>
Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that the gross 
national product grew at a annual rate of 2%, after adjustment for inflation, 
in the fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street, and provided a 
fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy was slowing to a 
sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term government 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock prices that has 
already been gathering steam of late. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir up investors' 
enthusiasm for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in 
face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 
8.74% from 8.79% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate bonds also made gains. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were up around 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose about 5/16 point, 
and long-term issues gained 5/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, increased 4.09 to 1,143.75. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials rose slightly. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, increased 0.60 to 299.97. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at midday at 9 3/16%, unchanged from late Thursday.

The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street and provided a 
fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy was slowing to a 
sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term government

Corporate bonds also made gains.

Still, analysts said the fourth-quarter data appeared to suggest that the 
economy was slowing down a bit, thereby easing fears of higher inflation. 
Bondholders worry that the Federal Reserve might push interest rates higher to 
prevent the economy from overheating.

discount dropped 4 basis points at 8.29%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity.

The Prospect Group Inc., a New York investment group with rail interests, said 
today it would bid $434 million for Illinois Central Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement put the spotlight on what role another IC shareholder that 
uses its rail lines, Archer Daniels Midland Co., would play. 
</P>
<P>
Prospect said it did not plan to merge the IC railroad with its MidSouth Corp., 
a Mississippi railroad bought from IC several years ago, planning instead to 
operate it as a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (IC) a good railroad now and we want to make it even better," Prospect 
spokesman Donald Dwight told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The bid was good news for IC shareholders. The price of the stock shot up $8 on 
the New York Stock Exchange to $22.50 on news of the $20-a-share bid. 
</P>
<P>
Prospect already owns 4.7% of Illinois Central, which, after several years of 
restructuring that included selling less profitable short-distance rail lines, 
was spun off Jan. 1 from Whitman Corp., now mainly a consumer products company. 
Whitman, previously called IC Industries, owns Midas International, a muffler 
company, and Pet Inc., a specialty-foods company.

JAPAN HOLDS '88 INFLATION TO 0.7%

<P>
Japan announced today that inflation for the year came to 0.7%, a figure 
greeted with relief by economists who had worried that brisk economic growth 
and a new sales tax might push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
They said the figure, the third straight year of inflation of less than 1%, 
points to low inflationary pressures for 1989 as well, with lower costs of 
imports dampening domestic prices and keeping a lid on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fell 0.3% in December from the previous month and rose 1% from a year 
earlier, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month decline in December was caused mainly by a sharp fall in 
prices of fresh vegetables and seaweeds, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists expect Japan's consumer price increases to hold below 2% this 
year, a level that presents no threat to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"If consumer prices were climbing 3% or 4%, we would have problems. But with 
prices going up between only 1% to 2% this year, there is no need for worry," 
said chief economist Toshiaki Kakimoto at Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Kakimoto sees consumer prices gaining 1.6% in 1989. Forecasts by other 
economists range between 1.4% and 1.9%.

The U.S. dollar surged against major foreign currencies in European trading 
today, overcoming what dealers said was repeated central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said central banks intervened twice in the day to sell 
dollars in an effort to keep exchange rates down. 
</P>
<P>
But the selling only encouraged the markets to regard the American currency as 
a good buy, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the U.S. Federal Reserve entered the market alone for a third time, 
late in the day, but failed to stem the dollar's rally. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.7655 late today, cheaper for buyers than 
Thursday's late $1.7730. 
</P>
<P>
Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared to Thursday's late rates: 
1.8570 West German marks, up from 1.8440; 1.5743 Swiss francs, up from 1.5671; 
6.2875 French francs, up from 6.2705; 2.0880 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 
1,352.37 Italian lire, up from 1,350.25; 1.1853 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.1816. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.65 Japanese yen, up from 127.52 yen. 
In London late today, the dollar traded higher at 128.93 yen.

Private Terms, Maryland's racing hero of 1988, has been sold to new owners who 
say they will keep the colt in the state for racing this year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Golden and Allaire du Pont have purchased the colt for an undisclosed 
sum, with the understanding that he will spend next year at their Northview 
Stallion Station, part of the old Windfields Farm in Chesapeake City. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Private Terms will stay in Maryland for stud duty. 
</P>
<P>
Private Terms will race this year for Locust Hill Farm, which bred and raced 
him, but Golden and du Pont are to share in his earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Our deal is for him to retire after the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 4," Golden said 
Thursday. "He's been made eligible for the Campbell Handicap at Pimlico April 
15 and the Pimlico Special May 13."

<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Steve Farr, who saved 20 games for the Kansas City Royals last 
season, has agreed to a one-year contract raising his pay almost $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on a $605,000 contract Thursday kept the matter from going to 
arbitration and anointed Farr as the team's closer out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
He had struggled the last five weeks of the season, when he had a 4.91 
earned-run average in his final 14 games. As a result, the Royals had been 
shopping around for another bullpen ace. 
</P>
<P>
But General Manager John Schuerholz now says he's satisfied that Farr can do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that Steve Farr is our stopper," Schuerholz said. "He's our guy 
to save games for us. If Steve can give us a year like he had last year, and 
some guys come through, I think we'll get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Farr, 32, who was on the verge of being let go two years ago, became the closer 
after the faltering veterans Dan Quisenberry and Gene Garber were released July 
4.

Robert S. Shriver III has withdrawn from a group of four investors who agreed 
to purchase the Baltimore Orioles last year for $70 million, Orioles president 
Larry Lucchino said. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver -- called "the architect of the sale" by his father, R. Sargent 
Shriver, also an investor -- left the group a couple of weeks ago to 
concentrate on other business interests, Lucchino said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles sale to the elder Shriver, Lucchino and New York financier Eli S. 
Jacobs cannot become official until approved by three-fourths of the 14 
American League owners and a majority of the 12 National League owners. Jacobs 
is the majority investor in the group.

Martin Denkin, the second highest ranking California boxing official, is under 
investigation in connection with charges that he extorted money in exchange for 
giving career breaks to certain boxers, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News reported that three managers, who asked that their 
names not be used because they fear retaliation, told the newspaper that they 
felt pressured into giving Denkin jewelry and cash totaling more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The paper also cited unidentified sources in the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office as saying Denkin has been the target of a probe since similar 
allegations were made to that office last summer. 
</P>
<P>
A "top official" in the prosecutor's office, not identified by name, was quoted 
as saying, "We are pursuing the allegations, and we are taking them seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Denkin earns $40,000 as assistant executive officer of the state Athletic 
Commission, a post where he is responsible for enforcing rules aimed largely at 
ensuring safety of athletes in ring sports. He has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so far-fetched, so ridiculous, so stupid," he said about the managers' 
accusations to the Mercury News. "I'm not worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
Denkin also works as a referee at major fights around the world and has 
appeared as a referee and announcer in Sylvester Stallone's "Rocky" films. He 
said he's made a lot of enemies by rigorously enforcing boxing rules.

<P>
Harry Caray, one of baseball's most flamboyant broadcasters for the last 44 
years, was named today the winner of the Ford Frick Award, presented annually 
by the baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Caray, who will be honored next July at the annual induction ceremonies, has 
been with the Chicago Cubs for the last seven seasons and is best known for 
standing in the press box and leading the fans in singing "Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame" during the seventh-inning stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Caray, who declines to give his age but is believed to be between 68 and 73, 
began his career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1944, broadcasting their games 
for 25 years. He spent 1970 with the Oakland Athletics, joined the Chicago 
White Sox the next year and switched to the Cubs 11 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Until February, 1987, when he suffered a stroke in Palm Springs, Caray had 
never missed an inning of a game. After the stroke, he was unable to move his 
right side and temporarily unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
But he was back in the Cubs' broadcast booth by May 20 -- after being replaced 
on a day-to-day basis by 32 "guest broadcasters" who included former baseball 
players and current broadcasting greats.
