If the Defense Department shuts down the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, the closure 
would not only eliminate the city's second-largest employer but also would 
tarnish the image of one of the nation's premier Navy towns, officials and 
workers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has targeted more than 100 military installations for 
possible closure or consolidation. Included are the 47-year-old Long Beach 
shipyard, the Army's Ft. Ord on the Monterey Peninsula and at least four other 
Northern California facilities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County apparently will not only avoid any cutbacks but actually could 
benefit from some of the potential closures or reductions throughout 
California, members of the local congressional delegation said Friday. If some 
of the recommended reductions on the list, scheduled to be released Monday by 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, are approved, military installations in San 
Diego could pick up manpower and services, the local congressmen said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado), whose sprawling district includes one 
targeted base in Imperial County, said Friday that he is more concerned over 
the "big-picture national security implications" posed by the possible cutbacks 
than enthused over any potential local dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's appropriate for us in San Diego to gleefully rub our hands 
together and try to figure out how somebody else's misfortune might accrue to 
our benefit," Hunter said. "It's more important to look to the national 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in California, word of the possible closures rattled nerves from Long 
Beach to San Francisco, where an estimated 38,000 workers face possible 
furlough, with dimmer prospects for new jobs as the defense budget shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers at the Long Beach shipyard, where rumors of reductions have been 
swirling for days, were near tears Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys are really choked up," said Frank Griffin Sr., a sheet metal 
mechanic at the yard for 25 years. "They are proud to work for their country, 
and they expect a little loyalty from the government in return. For a 45- or 
50-year-old guy to find out his job might be annihilated . . . it's a 
frightening thing." 
</P>
<P>
The three Northern California installations on the list for possible closure or 
realignment are the Alameda Naval Depot and Oakland Naval Supply Center in 
Alameda County and Moffett Naval Air Station in Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the list is El Centro's Naval Air Facility in Imperial County, which 
has about 450 military and civilian personnel, according to Hunter. The winter 
home of the Navy's precision Blue Angels flying team, the facility also serves 
as a year-round staging base for desert gunnery ranges. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy warned that it also would consider closing or realigning Treasure 
Island Naval Station, Oak Knoll Naval Hospital and the Naval Air Station at 
Alameda if Congress's budget authorizations are less than what has been 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
"If the base closed down, the only thing I could do is pack up the truck and go 
home to Alabama -- and there's not much there," said Ronnie Phillips, 25, a 
forklift operator at the Naval Supply Center in economically depressed West 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Some elected officials expressed outrage over the threatened closure of the 
Long Beach shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Administration thinks they can do this without any impunity, they are 
sadly mistaken," said Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude. "The 
popularity of this Administration is going to sink very quickly if they 
indiscriminately close or try to relocate these facilities." 
</P>
<P>
"I have said that I do not know why the Navy would even contemplate such a 
misguided action against the most loyal Navy town in America," Rep. Anderson 
said. "I simply do not understand the logic behind trying to close down the 
most productive and efficient yard while keeping those yards losing money open. 
</P>
<P>
The shipyard employs 4,100 workers who overhaul and maintain Navy surface 
ships. It is the only West Coast base that is not licensed to perform nuclear 
work, a factor that some officials believe helps explain it being targeting for 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the shipyard would cost the community about $100 million a year and 
an estimated $250 million in the Southern California region from spin-off jobs 
and subcontracts that the Navy work generates, according to Laurie Hunter, vice 
president of the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In sheer numbers, the closures would be felt most in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, where the Navy employs 56,000 civilians and military personnel. If all 
the military bases named Friday were to be shut or realigned, 34,113 jobs would 
be lost in the Bay Area. But economists said the impact would be worst on the 
Monterey Peninsula, where Ft. Ord accounts for 15,129 military jobs, 3,000 
civilian workers and an annual payroll of $317 million. 
</P>
<P>
But, not everyone was upset by the possible closures in California. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that "peace and prosperity can go hand in hand," Louise McNeilly, 
coordinator of the Center for Economic Conversion in the Silicon Valley city of 
Mountain View, said that closing the Moffett Naval Air Station there could free 
up land to ease the area's housing shortage, or become the site of a space 
museum or a garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
And the lucrative Port of Long Beach, bursting at the seams and hunting for 
room to grow, could convert the precious shipyard land for container storage 
space. The port is now looking at landfills to expand, at a cost of about half 
a million dollars an acre. The shipyard space would represent more than 
$1-billion worth of property, by some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"That would make one very nice terminal," said Harbor Commissioner Joel 
Friedland. "But that is nothing compared to what a shipyard contributes to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks at Long Beach, meanwhile, could mean more ship-repair work for San 
Diego, while any reductions at Alameda's Naval Aviation Depot could produce 
extra jobs at San Diego's North Island Naval Air Station, according to Hunter 
aide John Palafoutas. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect San Diego not only will hold its own, but come out a little ahead in 
the game," said Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Bates' comments echoed the earlier prediction of Rear Adm. John W. Adams, 
commander of San Diego Naval Base, who said Thursday that the number of ships 
based in San Diego could increase under the new defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
"If you close home ports, ships will have to go somewhere, and San Diego is a 
pretty logical place for them to come," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene likely to be repeated by other congressmen whose districts face 
possible cutbacks, Hunter sent a letter to Cheney on Friday in which he began 
to make a case for trying to prevent the closure of the Naval Air Facility in 
El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the facility's remoteness and the area's weather -- last year there 
were 360 "flying days" at the base -- make it ideal for training, Hunter argues 
that closing it would be ill advised, both for economic and defense reasons. 
Pilots from Miramar Naval Air Station often train in El Centro when bad weather 
along the coast curtails flying here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not wise to cut national defense, because that ignores the history of how 
we got to where we are today," said Hunter, a member of the House Armed 
Services Committee. "This 'peace dividend' talk is a misnomer. The fact is, we 
have peace as a dividend because our national defense was strengthened during 
the Reagan years." 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of disarmament said that the cutbacks eventually will actually 
improve the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased because it means there are less dangers to the citizens of Long 
Beach and the surrounding area," said Harold Collins, chairman of the Long 
Beach Area Peace Network, a coalition of 20 organizations. "We have never 
fought against the Navy, just ships and nuclear weapons."

Today is Jan. 27, a date that you instantly associate with one unforgettable 
event. No doubt most people can remember exactly where they were at 6:30 that 
evening in 1984, when the dramatic news flashed across the wires: 
</P>
<P>
A smoke bomb burst during the filming of a Pepsi commercial at the Shrine 
Auditorium, setting singer Michael Jackson's hair on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Some Westside residents are a bit sad to see the demise of a neighborhood 
institution, the 42-year-old Picwood Theater -- especially since it's being 
leveled to make way for an expansion of the traffic-choked Westside Pavilion 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cleveland Wrecking Co., which is carrying out the demolition, takes a 
more light-hearted view of the situation, as you can see from the accompanying 
photo. Nothing like a grinning executioner. 
</P>
<P>
When City Councilman Joel Wachs proposed changing the name of Ventura Place to 
Sakharov Street in honor of the Soviet dissident, a group of residents came up 
with what they thought was a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
They voted 65 to 0 to change the name of the Joel Wachs Senior Center to the 
Andrei Sakharov Senior Center, says Kurt Hunter, president of the North 
Hollywood Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
What the residents didn't know was that the Wachs Center was renamed the East 
Valley Center when it landed in Councilman John Ferraro's district after 
reapportionment a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, incidentally, doesn't have anything named after him now. Greg Nelson, 
his spokesman, was reminded of the political saw: "Don't have anything named 
after you until you're dead. Then they won't dare change it." 
</P>
<P>
In "Departed (Yet Unlamented) '80s Restaurants," critic Deborah Sroloff of the 
Reader's Guide newspaper cheerfully sounds taps for some unfavorite eateries 
that failed to make it into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
She singles out the late 1520 A.D. on La Cienega ("this truly stupid, fake 
moyen-age palace of Henry VIII-inspired gluttony"), Gatsby's on San Vicente (a 
nominee for "the Ugliest Buildings in L.A. Hall of Fame") and Patrick Terrail's 
Hollywood Diner on Fairfax ("disastrous attempt to cash in on the then-hot 
diner craze"). 
</P>
<P>
Alas, we should also note that the '80s saw the passing of several landmark 
eateries, including such Sunset Strip institutions as Schwab's (1932-1983), the 
Cock 'n' Bull (1937-1987), and the Columbia Cafe (1933-1983); one-time Wilshire 
stars, such as the Original Brown Derby (1926-1980), Perino's (1934-1988) and 
Dolores' Drive-In (1938-1981), and Hollywood's Tick Tock (1930-1988). 
</P>
<P>
Gone also are the two Googie's (of downtown and the Sunset Strip), whose wildly 
angular designs and lavish use of glass walls inspired the use of the term 
"Googie" to describe '50s coffee shop architecture. 
</P>
<P>
And, last, the most fatefully named eatery to disappear on the Westside: 
Fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that Joe Brito suggested here recently that Santa Monica could 
end its desperate search for an official city song by adopting the '40s tune, 
"When Veronica Plays Her Harmonica on the Pier at Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
Now, T.E. Foreman of Riverside writes: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it as, 'When Veronica Plays Her Harmonica Down on the Beach at 
Santa Monica."' 
</P>
<P>
Next, we'll learn it was really, "When Max Plays His Sax (etc., etc.). . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that L.A. hosted the first Super Bowl in 1967 -- and that Green Bay was 
one of the contestants -- a Redondo Beach reader recalls a popular riddle of 
the time: 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if the Green Bay players celebrated a bit too much on the 
Sunset Strip?" 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "(Sheriff) Peter Pitchess would pinch a pack of pickled Packers."

Photo, Wintering Hole: Canada geese fly over and feed near the Sepulveda Basin 
wildlife lake, which is being filled with half a foot of water this week so 
migratory fowl can use it as a resting place for the winter. The 10-acre lake 
near Woodley Avenue and Burbank Boulevard has blinds, such as the one below, 
for bird-watchers. The lake was to be filled this fall, but an engineering 
mistake delayed the project. The lake bottom was dug too deep to drain properly 
and had to be regraded at a cost of about $45,000, said Gary Schussolin, a city 
parks engineer. The lake will be drained every summer to prevent mosquitos from 
breeding in it. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times

WIFE ACCUSED IN SLAYING USED 2ND GUN, POLICE SAY

A prosecutor said Friday that a Tarzana woman who claimed to have mistaken her 
husband for a burglar before shooting and killing him attempted to "finish him 
off" with a second gun. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Evelyn Mellinger was charged Friday in the death of her millionaire 
husband in the couple's exclusive hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Baker, assistant head deputy in the Van Nuys branch of the district 
attorney's office, said Carole Mellinger allegedly shot her husband, Brainerd 
Lee Mellinger, four times with a handgun in the den of their home and then 
apparently attempted to use a shotgun to "finish him off." 
</P>
<P>
Three unfired shotgun rounds were found near Mellinger's body, and a shotgun 
was found nearby with one round in the chamber, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"She probably tried to finish him off with a shotgun but did not know you had 
to take the safety off," Baker theorized. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot was fired into the ceiling of the home in the 19700 block of Komar 
Drive, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Mellinger then called a relative who called police, Baker said. Her 
husband was dead by the time police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Physical evidence at the scene" and "inconsistencies in her statements" 
prompted detectives to arrest her, said Los Angeles Police Detective Rick 
Swanston. 
</P>
<P>
Both guns were recovered at the home and there was no sign of forced entry, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger, 48, pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court. Her preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 6. She was being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no immediate motive for the murder, police said Carole 
Mellinger had been drinking before the shooting and the couple, married for 23 
years, apparently had marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, owner of a Woodland Hills import-export firm, had appeared in 
several cable TV commercials for establishing a similar business.

BOY, 15, GETS CYA TERM IN SEX-SLAYING OF NEIGHBOR, 7; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE YOUTH WILL PROBABLY BE RELEASED BY AGE 25. THE VICTIM'S MOTHER 
SAYS HE IS BEYOND REHABILITATION.

A Newhall teen-ager, described by his victim's mother as a "monster," was 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Friday for sexually molesting and 
murdering a 7-year-old neighbor, whose body was found stuffed behind his bed 
three days after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Cooper, who was 14 when he strangled Sara Nan Hodges in March, will 
probably spend about 10 years in custody because the California Youth Authority 
can retain jurisdiction over him only until he reaches the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
During an emotional sentencing hearing, Linda Hodges, the victim's mother, 
condemned Cooper's parents for failing to notice early warning signs of his 
emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it is impossible to conceive of a human being involved in such a vile 
act, it is hard to believe that this boy never showed any signs before this 
incident," she said, reading from her prepared statement. "I believe that those 
responsible waited far too long to seek help." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she said, she believes Cooper is "a disregarded monster," who cannot be 
rehabilitated and must be kept away from society for as long as possible. She 
said she regrets that the criminal justice system "deems it necessary to give 
youth a second chance at age 25." 
</P>
<P>
"This sentence is just a slap on the hands," Hodges said. "It is important that 
this boy's life be somewhere where he can be kept from committing such an act." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a slender youth clad in a gray juvenile hall sweat shirt, sat with his 
eyes closed. His mother, Crystal Cooper, dabbed tears from her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cooper discovered Sara Hodges' decomposing body in her son's bedroom 
last Easter, while trying to track down the source of a foul odor. The body was 
stuffed between a wall and the headboard of his water bed, and Cooper had set 
up a fan to try to blow the smell out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had been looking for the missing child for three days, using dogs, 
helicopters and mounted-search posses, and Cooper had been one of the first to 
volunteer to help search for her. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper pleaded guilty to murder with a special allegation of sexual assault the 
day his trial was to begin on Nov. 2, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Barbara Duey, Cooper's attorney, said Cooper wants and 
needs psychiatric therapy. She blamed Florida social service agencies for 
neglecting Cooper's obvious problems, which she said were manifested in his 
unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Duey said Cooper "has been looking for help for years" for his "severe 
emotional problems," but in Florida, he was "shifted from agency to agency" 
without ever receiving appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper moved to Newhall from Florida -- where he had lived with his father -- 
in February after he had been arrested for a string of petty thefts and 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Alderbrook Drive house where he lived with his mother was five doors from 
the home of his blonde, blue-eyed victim. The two sometimes went horseback 
riding together. 
</P>
<P>
Duey said Cooper is "very remorseful, has taken responsibility for his actions, 
is well aware of how the incident has impacted the community, and has been 
accepting of his punishment." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt pointed out that Cooper "was able to 
sleep for three nights with Sara Hodges behind his bed. How can a person who 
was able to do that be a person with a conscience or remorse?" 
</P>
<P>
She said Cooper planned the murder about a week before it occurred, and had 
planned -- but never carried out -- a similar murder two years earlier, while 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a belief that he had to kill to have sexual relations," said 
Rosenblatt. 
</P>

WOMAN BEHIND BARS AFTER RARE BIRD FLIES THE COOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare Central American scarlet macaw that failed to return from an excursion 
with a female companion has left its owner in tears and landed a Val Verde 
woman in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The $3,000 bird, named Big Bird, was last seen Thursday when Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Neal Hickerson went to a Val Verde house to check on a report 
that it was being kept there illegally, Sheriff's Lt. Dennis Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, witnesses say they saw Aura Elizabeth Tapia, 32, lure the bird from a 
tree into her house with a tomato, deputies said. Sure enough, the bird roaming 
freely in Tapia's bedroom fit the description of Big Bird perfectly -- down to 
the two missing nails on its right foot. The bird had been missing since Jan. 
11, when it failed to return to bird trainer Jay Kapac's house from a flight 
with a female Mexican macaw named Lola. 
</P>
<P>
But Tapia insisted the bird was hers and said her husband had documents that 
could prove it when he returned from work in Culver City, Burns said. Hickerson 
agreed to return later to check the documents, but when he came back Tapia was 
gone. And so was "Big Bird," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is unclear, but Kapac and sheriff's deputies speculate the 
woman might have left the bird with friends or relatives in Val Verde, or her 
husband might have taken it to Culver City after returning home Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies returned to the house Friday night, they arrested Tapia on 
suspicion of misappropriation of found property, Burns said. She had not told 
deputies where they might find the bird, and detectives were expected to 
continue the investigation on Monday, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Kapac said the bird's owner, Kathleen Goss of Ventura, has been devastated by 
the loss of Big Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathleen is really emotionally distraught over the loss of this bird," he 
said. "She knows I'm very good with birds and that's why she trusted me." 
</P>
<P>
Kapac said the bird's Jan. 11 flight was part of its flourishing courtship with 
Lola. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very intelligent, trained bird and was trained to fly and come back," 
Kapac said. "It took a little flight with its girlfriend. They were flying all 
over the neighborhood. They were just landing from one tree to another, and 
apparently he landed in this one tree and she got separated and he never came 
back. Probably he was just curious." 
</P>
<P>
Kapac said he fears the bird was easily lured by Tapia because he has a 
weakness for women. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably missed Kathy," he said.

WHY L.A.'S AIR HAS GONE STALE; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: THE LOCAL MARKET IS HUGELY PROFITABLE, BUT THE AIRWAVES HAVE 
GOTTEN BLANDER AND DUMBER SINCE THE FCC CANCELED PUBLIC-INTEREST RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND D. EDELMAN, Edmund D. Edelman is member of the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Los Angeles," a local broadcast executive recently crowed, "is undeniably the 
healthiest radio market in the U.S. today." 
</P>
<P>
Judged solely by advertising, that may be true. An industry survey projects 
1989 ad revenues of a staggering $400 million or more. Commercial spots on one 
highly rated rock station now sell for as much as $1,500 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Boom times indeed, it would seem -- at least for broadcasters. But for 
audiences, the times are increasingly a bust. And a combination of market 
pressures and federal deregulatory policies dictates that this destructive 
trend not only will continue, it will accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, classical music listeners mourned the demise of venerable KFAC, Los 
Angeles' only commercial classical outlet, transformed by its new owners into a 
more marketable rock format. KKGO-FM has stepped into the breach with an 
all-new classical format, leaving its loyal jazz listeners in the same 
predicament that classical fans had just escaped. 
</P>
<P>
How is it that a broadcast market with more than 80 stations serving millions 
of listeners can no longer find room for even one classical and one jazz 
station at the same time, while endless variations on the same old rock themes 
elbow one another up and down the dial? 
</P>
<P>
The paucity of quality programming is not confined to music, or even to radio. 
For more than a decade, the TV air time devoted to serious public-affairs 
programming has steadily dwindled. A 1989 study by Essential Information, a 
Washington-based research organization founded by Ralph Nader, charted an 
average 51% decline during the past decade in issue-oriented public-affairs 
programming on TV stations across 50 markets surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
When I became a Los Angeles County supervisor in 1974, most local radio and TV 
stations maintained some kind of news department and carried regular newscasts. 
As part of their public-affairs programming, nearly a dozen radio and TV 
stations aired editorials on timely and important issues. They offered a forum 
for public discussion of the public's business. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that vigorous, multifaceted debate has faded. Only a few public-minded 
radio and TV stations broadcast any editorials whatsoever. Broadcast schedules 
are stuffed with sensation-seeking talk shows, so-called "tabloid-TV" programs 
and "infotainment." 
</P>
<P>
Washington must share the blame for this sorry situation. For decades, federal 
policy decreed that the airwaves belonged to the public and that broadcasters 
earned the right to retain their monopoly licenses on a given frequency by 
operating "in the public interest, convenience and necessity." The Federal 
Communications Commission scrutinized their program logs, entertaining 
challenges from competing applicants before it granted a license renewal. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed when Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency, claiming a mandate 
to "get government off our backs." Mark Fowler, Reagan's man at the FCC, 
virtually abandoned his assigned role of ensuring that broadcasters operated in 
the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's commission abolished the modest guidelines mandating a minimum amount 
of news and information programming. Further, it repealed the so-called 
"anti-trafficking rule," which required owners to hold onto a station for at 
least three years before selling and put other limits on station ownership. The 
FCC said its rules were just that, not laws, and could be unilaterally canceled 
by their makers. 
</P>
<P>
These actions destroyed any sense of broadcaster responsibility to the public 
and touched off a frenzy of speculation that sent station prices skyrocketing 
while burying new owners under mountains of debt. In such an environment, only 
the most profitable -- that is, mass-appeal -- formats can hope to survive. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 FCC action delivered the fatal blow to issue-oriented public-affairs 
programming. In the name of expanding broadcasters' First Amendment rights, the 
commission abolished its 38-year-old "Fairness Doctrine" rule, which called on 
broadcasters to devote a reasonable amount of time to opposing views on issues 
of public importance. 
</P>
<P>
The industry had denounced the Fairness Doctrine's "chilling effect" on free 
speech, but after its repeal, the big chill only deepened. More and more 
stations abandoned any pretense of serious commentary and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Only Congress can cool the speculative fever that undermines quality 
programming by reinstating, with the force of law, FCC policies governing 
station ownership; only Congress can reinvigorate the public-policy debate by 
codifying the Fairness Doctrine into law. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasters instinctively resist any regulation as an infringement on their 
constitutional rights. But the First Amendment protects and empowers everyone, 
after all, not only the media. As the Supreme Court noted in its unanimous 1969 
decision upholding the Fairness Doctrine, "It is the right of the viewers and 
listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount." 
</P>
<P>
It's time for Congress to take that principle to heart, and re-enact it as 
federal law.

SLOUCHING TOWARD A RELIGIOUS LEVY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE SUPREME COURT DECISION ALLOWING CALIFORNIA TO TAX ITEMS SOLD BY 
SWAGGART MINISTRIES COMPROMISES THE RIGHT OF WORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL SHAW, Russell Shaw is director of public information for the Knights 
of Columbus, Washington, D.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that California can tax the sale 
of religious items by religious groups, the media, for the most part, yawned. 
The closest thing to alarm was a headline in the Washington Times: "High Court 
Allows Sales Tax on Bible." In truth, the court's decision in Swaggart 
Ministries vs. California Board of Equalization may be an instance of rendering 
unto Caesar much more than he deserves. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some entrepreneurial activities conducted by churches should be 
taxed. Swaggart Ministries conceded as much when it decided against contesting 
California's levy on its T-shirts and vases. But there are at least two reasons 
for thinking twice before taxing the sale of religious items by religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
One is social utility. In many communities, the work of church-sponsored 
social-welfare agencies -- from homeless shelters to AIDS hospices -- 
supplements public programs and institutions. The nation would be poorer 
without this benevolence. 
</P>
<P>
It would also be poorer in the pocketbook. Church institutions and programs 
save American taxpayers a lot of money. Consider parochial schools. They do a 
better job than public schools with students of similar background, according 
to standardized test results. Furthermore, parochial schools do it cheaper. If 
inner-city parochial schools serving large numbers of poor, non-Catholic 
children went out of business, taxpayers in scores of cities would face the 
painful -- and expensive -- necessity of picking up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Churches also nurture a moral vision that is indispensable to sustaining the 
underpinnings of the social order. Without religion and its convictions 
concerning the transcendent value of the human person, Glenn Tinder wrote 
recently in the Atlantic Monthly, "the spiritual center of Western politics 
fades and vanishes." The secularized West may already be living off the capital 
of its religious past. 
</P>
<P>
Taxing the sale of religious goods, of course, would not prohibit churches from 
performing socially useful tasks. But it would make doing so more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason to proceed slowly on religious taxes is rooted in a 
constitutional principle. The First Amendment forbids Congress to pass a law 
respecting the "establishment" of religion (no state church) or "the free 
exercise thereof." The protection is embodied in the phrase, "separation of 
church and state." 
</P>
<P>
Separation cuts two ways. It's meant to keep religion out of government; it's 
meant to bar government from interfering in matters religious. The latter 
prohibition is essential to preserving everyone's right to worship as he or she 
pleases. It is here that the Swaggart decision is worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Swaggart has long sold Bibles, religious pamphlets, tapes and various 
other items by mail and at his crusades. During eight of those years, the state 
of California contended in court, the TV evangelist ran up a tax bill in 
California of $166,000, plus interest. Swaggart protested, arguing that the tax 
interfered with his free exercise of religion. He was supported in court by 
such religious groups as the National Council of Churches, the Watchtower Bible 
and Tract Society (Jehovah's Witnesses) and the International Society for 
Krishna Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
In determining if a law or policy violates the First Amendment's free-exercise 
clause, the Supreme Court uses a three-pronged test. Is the purpose of the law 
primarily secular? Does the law directly benefit or harm religion? Does it 
represent "excessive entanglement" between church and state? 
</P>
<P>
The secular purpose of the tax law was clear: Nothing personal -- California 
just wants its money. But the court's handling of the remaining two questions 
is hard to understand. 
</P>
<P>
There's a curious passage in Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion that 
highlights the flaw in the court's reasoning. Sales taxes don't create 
church-state entanglement, she argued, since they don't "require the state to 
inquire into the religious content of the items sold or the religious 
motivation for selling or purchasing the items, because the materials are 
subject to the tax regardless of content or motive." 
</P>
<P>
But suppose the content of an item and motive for selling or buying it are, 
indeed, religious? What if selling the item, even at a profit, is the religious 
ministry, as is the case for many religious groups? If so, taxing the sale of 
the religious item is tantamount to taxing the ministry itself. Put another 
way, the ministry is being taxed for exercising its First Amendment right. 
O'Connor, of course, doesn't want to hear about that. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, O'Connor noted that the court's analysis might have been different had 
a heavier tax been levied, which would have threatened "effectively (to) choke 
off an adherent's religious practices." The Supreme Court doesn't want to do 
that, but its reasoning in Swaggart clears the way to compromise the free 
exercise of religion just the same.

POSITIVE NOTES COME FROM MUSIC CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statistics in your article on music education horrified me ("Music in 
Schools: A Sour Note," Part A, Jan. 17). 
</P>
<P>
Plato said, "I would teach the children physics and philosophy and music -- and 
of those, music is the most important, for the key to all learning lies in the 
patterns of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing kids get from music education isn't music. It's the 
realization that you can start out with no skills whatsoever and if you stick 
to it without judging yourself, you can accomplish almost anything! 
</P>
<P>
That knowledge -- that personal power cannot be acquired while sitting and 
watching television. 
</P>
<P>
All studies show that consistent music training improves reading ability, math 
skills, attendance, attitude and even posture! 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the country, I find that our kids are musically illiterate, 
but in the areas that treasure their bands and choruses (like Texas and 
Minnesota), the youngsters consider their music to be the most exciting 
experience of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Only parental interest and parental pressure on school boards make the 
difference.

GROWTH PLANS FOR LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "No Growth or All Growth?" editorial, Jan. 16: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a special city, with unique possibilities. Here in Los Angeles, 
we take seriously the need for development that is sensitive to the environment 
and to the principles of good neighborhood planning. 
</P>
<P>
While The Times (in its editorial) has a penchant for wrongly affixing a label 
of either "pro-development" or a "slow-growth advocate" to a city leader, I 
feel our city plan to manage and funnel our growth to the areas most in need 
cannot easily be categorized in either of these positions. 
</P>
<P>
I remain committed, as I have been since I began serving as mayor, to creating 
jobs for the people of this city. New development is one such way to create 
employment opportunities. But, when I consider endorsing a proposed project, I 
look at a number of other factors to determine if it meets my goals for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Any proposed project must be sensitive to its environment, and responsive to 
the needs of nearby residents. This simple credo was applied to the massive 
Porter Ranch project and the Santa Monica Airport expansion proposal; both fell 
short of my expectations, and I raised serious objections. 
</P>
<P>
On Porter Ranch, The Times dismisses my action as not having any impact on the 
project at all. Well, the editors were certainly not looking at the same 
before-and-after comparison about the 1,200-acre project that I did. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear the original Porter Ranch plan would significantly increase 
automobile trips, further degrade our air quality, waste natural resources, and 
exacerbate our short supply of affordable housing. I raised concrete 
objections. Within a week, the proposal was substantially re-configured and the 
specific plan rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
These same criteria, specifically that a project contain the most up-to-date 
environmental and transportation planning, are applied daily to upcoming 
projects. As The Times points out, future development sites such as Farmers 
Market and the Ambassador Hotel will impact many. And I will carefully 
scrutinize and evaluate both. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Donald Trump's announcement regarding the Ambassador Hotel, I 
have already conveyed my strong feelings to him that any project on that site 
must factor in the need for additional school space in the nearby area. 
</P>
<P>
Reasonable, managed growth is the only way a city the size of Los Angeles can 
adapt to the new challenges of a new decade. 
</P>
<P>
My goal has always been to see the city prosper as it grows. While some areas 
of the city have seen the fruits of this prosperity, others have been left 
behind. In the future, we will be asking developers to spread the benefits of 
new growth to other areas of the city. We will, of course, protect those 
neighborhoods already congested from further overdevelopment.

MOYNIHAN'S PLAN TO CUT PAYROLL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone having faith in the integrity of a government trust fund probably still 
believes in the tooth fairy. 
</P>
<P>
A government trust fund is an accounting procedure that transfers money from 
the government's left pocket to its right pocket. It is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
We either trust our government to live up to its obligations or we don't. A 
trust fund won't make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The payroll tax is a revenue-raising tax like any other tax and we should stop 
kidding ourselves that it is different because it is earmarked for a special 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
And why it stops at an arbitrary figure like $51,300 is something that has 
never been properly explained.

CRANSTON'S BILL TO AID LINCOLN BONDHOLDERS RECOVER FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am outraged at the proposal by Sen. Cranston for the federal government to 
bail out the bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that he is desperate in his attempt to avoid his share of the 
responsibility for the Lincoln collapse and subsequent scandal by shifting the 
financial burden to taxpayers who had nothing to do with this sordid problem. 
</P>
<P>
While I can sympathize with those investors who lost money by their 
ill-considered purchase of Lincoln bonds, I believe that it is only fair for 
those investors -- sad as it may be -- to suffer their losses in the same way 
as I and many others have for our poor investment decisions. If not, am I now 
free to assume that Cranston will carry a bill in the Senate to reimburse me 
for any of my stock market losses, particularly those suffered in the October, 
1987, crash? Certainly there must be someone in the federal government, 
possibly in the Securities and Exchange Commission, who is truly responsible 
for these losses! 
</P>
<P>
So quit trying to pass the buck, Sen. Cranston.

GROWTH PLANS FOR LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial incorrectly and unfairly leaves one with the impression that 
Mayor Bradley's concern with, and attention to, issues of responsible growth 
management is both newly developed and sporadic. Contrary to the image 
presented in your editorial, Mayor Bradley has been a strong and consistent 
supporter of thorough land use planning at both the project level and on 
citywide issues. 
</P>
<P>
Programs like the community plan revisions and the updating of the citywide 
elements of the General Plan now under way are restructuring and strengthening 
the planning framework of the city, bringing them up to current standards. When 
combined with other programs such as the growth management element now being 
developed, Los Angeles will have the final element of the "fair, but flexible" 
plan, for which your editorial calls and towards which the city has been 
steadily working. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the mayor's positions on specific projects your editorial is 
self-contradicting. On the one hand you chide the mayor for not speaking out on 
the Farmers Market or Central City West before either has been thoroughly 
reviewed or gone through necessary hearings, while on the other hand primly 
reminding everyone that the Ambassador site deserves to be judged solely on the 
merits. Neither the Farmers Market nor the Central City West specific plans 
have been brought forward for a full hearing, nor have all the facts been put 
on the table. I suggest that for the mayor to take a position without benefit 
of all the facts would be not only unwise but uncharacteristic.

LANCASTER MAN SLAIN IN FRONT OF RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old Lancaster man was shot and killed in front of a restaurant, and 
investigators were looking for two suspects, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose identity was not released until his family could be located, 
was killed at 9:20 p.m. Thursday in front of Seven Brothers restaurant in the 
4200 block of Sierra Highway, Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the slaying was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what caused the shooting or what the relationship was between 
the victim and the suspects," Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were looking for two men believed to be in their early 20s who fled 
from the shooting in a 1967 or 1968 Plymouth Barracuda that was yellow with a 
black vinyl top.

MOYNIHAN'S PLAN TO CUT PAYROLL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coming through the revolving door of deception now is President Bush's 
deja-voodoo economics. 
</P>
<P>
He supports the shifting of surplus payroll tax revenue from the Social 
Security fund where it belongs, to the federal budget, where it doesn't -- a 
transparent fraud against low- and middle-income employees. 
</P>
<P>
Let's have no more accusing elderly Social Security recipients of robbing 
younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's "pay-as-you-go" proposal is the right and honest way to go.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL CHAPLAIN ARRESTED IN LEWD CONDUCT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Roman Catholic chaplain assigned to the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho jail 
in Castaic has been arrested on suspicion of lewd conduct at a downtown Los 
Angeles park, the Los Angeles Police Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Robert John Williams, 41, of Los Angeles was released on his own 
recognizance after the arrest Wednesday night in Echo Park and is scheduled to 
be arraigned Feb. 15, Los Angeles Police Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams exposed himself to a plainclothes vice officer in a men's room at the 
park, Booth said. A single count of misdemeanor lewd conduct is being sought 
against Williams, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Los Angeles city attorney's office could not be reached 
Friday evening to determine if the charge had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. John C. Thurman, commander of the jail's 
north/south facility, said Williams has been asked not to return to work at the 
facility until the case is resolved. He will not be permitted to work there 
again if he is convicted, Thurman said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICERS AWARDED $100,000 IN DISMISSAL OF 
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Burbank police officers have been awarded $100,000 each from a man whose 
lawsuit charging them with brutality was dismissed by a judge as frivolous, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge entered the judgment Jan. 4 in favor 
of Detective Brian R. Arnspiger and Sgt. Patrick V. Lynch after the defendant, 
Kent Allen Kelley II, failed to contest the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The officers were told of the decision Thursday in a letter from their 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy because it's taken so long and we're finally vindicated," 
Arnspiger said. "When something like that happens, it kind of digs at you." 
</P>
<P>
The officers, claiming malicious prosecution, countersued Kelley in 1985 after 
a Burbank Superior Court judge threw out the man's lawsuit alleging the 
officers brutalized him and robbed him during his arrest at a Burbank bar in 
December, 1980. Police had received a call that Kelley was drunk and was trying 
to pick fights and gamble at the pool table, Arnspiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Kelley's suit alleged that the officers handcuffed him too 
tightly and threw him against the steel bars of a cell at the Burbank jail.

1 OF 4 ESCAPEES CAPTURED IN COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of four suspects who escaped last month from an extradition agency's 
station wagon near Gorman was recaptured Friday in Pueblo, Colo., the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
David Allen Jeffrey, 30, was in custody at the Pueblo sheriff's jail awaiting 
extradition to California to face charges of armed robbery, grand theft auto, 
and assault with a deadly weapon, Deputy George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey escaped Dec. 28 after another prisoner in the station wagon feigned 
illness and pointed a shotgun at the driver after he stopped the car on a 
freeway off-ramp, authorities said. The prisoners handcuffed the driver and his 
wife to a telephone pole and drove off in the station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspects have not been captured, officials said.

MORNING BRIEFING: WELL, THE ADVICE WAS KIND OF ERRATIC, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Steinberg, general manager of the New York Jets, coordinated the Rams' 
draft in 1979, when Joe Montana came out of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
What was the report on the future San Francisco 49er star? 
</P>
<P>
"He was kind of an erratic guy," Steinberg said. "Even then, he was a guy who 
could win games for you in the fourth quarter. He did that a lot, but on a 
game-to-game basis, he was never really that consistent. His arm is actually 
stronger now than when he came out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's perfect for the (49er) system. If he was playing for the Raiders with 
their old style, and they wanted him to go upfield 15 times a game, that 
wouldn't be his forte. His forte is the quick read, the quick release, the 
touch pass over (linebackers) and the ability to throw on the run." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the last team to repeat as NFL champion under different 
coaches? 
</P>
<P>
Grudge match: Charlie Waters, coach of the Denver Broncos' defensive backs, has 
a personal incentive to beat the 49ers. On Jan. 10, 1982, Dwight Clark's end 
zone catch of a pass by Montana gave the 49ers a 28-27 victory over Waters and 
the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
"Montana was throwing that ball away," Waters said. "I was 17 yards away, 
covering the tight end. I was so sure the ball couldn't be caught, I was 
thinking ahead to what I'd call the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my last play in the NFL. I dreamed of going out as MVP of the Super 
Bowl; instead, I went out burying my face in kitty litter in Candlestick Park. 
I'd love to be able to get even." 
</P>
<P>
Thrill is gone: Ronnie Lott, 49er defensive back, on helping to enforce an 
informal curfew among his teammates in New Orleans: "I told the guys that we 
come down here every year anyway (to play the Saints). If you haven't gone to 
Bourbon Street already, then something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Add thrill is gone: Bronco receivers Vance Johnson, Mark Jackson and Ricky 
Nattiel were hot properties as the Three Amigos before Super Bowl XXII. But the 
Broncos lost to the Washington Redskins, 42-10, then had a mediocre season in 
1988. What happened to their mystique? Nattiel said: "When you go 8-8, people 
kind of forget about you." 
</P>
<P>
Easier to read: Steve Young, backup quarterback for the 49ers, on the 
difference between Coach George Seifert and his predecessor, Bill Walsh: 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about him (Seifert) is that he's very consistent. You can depend 
on him screaming at you when you deserve to be screamed at, and you can depend 
on him having a sense of humor. He's not going to make everybody squinch their 
eyebrows and say, 'What's going on here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Add contrast: Offensive lineman Guy McIntyre said: "Bill Walsh was the master 
of disguises. George Seifert is the master of being George Seifert." 
</P>
<P>
After further review: The ultimate Super Bowl side bet? The Las Vegas Hilton 
Race and Sports SuperBook is offering 2-1 odds that a call during the game will 
not be reversed using instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Chicago Bears, in 1932-33 under Ralph Jones and George 
Halas.

MCNALL, VACHON GET THEIR NICHOLLS' WORTH OF ADVICE FROM FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past nine years, I've been pulling my hair out watching Bernie Nicholls 
play. He continually turns the puck over in the offensive zone, he seldom looks 
to make a pass, and when he does, it is an attempt at perfection that usually 
ends in a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
But most frustrating are his half-hearted attempts at back-checking. It seems 
when he doesn't have the puck, the game is not quite as important. Throughout 
his career, the Kings have allowed more goals than they've scored when Bernie 
is on the ice, a rare feat for a top-10 scorer. 
</P>
<P>
My hat is off to Rogie and Bruce for realizing that all five attackers need to 
play defense and not just your two defensemen.

ALBERT'S PERFORMANCE NOT WHAT NHL NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was nice to see network TV finally recognize the NHL by televising the 
All-Star game. However, if the purpose was to help expand awareness of this 
sport to the American public, NBC made one drastic mistake. By having Marv 
Albert do the play-by-play, more potential fans were probably scared away due 
to his ineptness.

In the story of the Sunkist Invitational track meet, writer Julie Cart went far 
overboard in focusing on the failure of the milers to threaten world records. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her story grudgingly noted that while several meet records were set, 
they were in seldom-held events. Huh! 
</P>
<P>
Meet records were recorded in the men's long jump, the men's 3000 meters and 
women's 50-meter hurdles. All are official events listed by the IAAF for world

It isn't being played in Los Angeles, nor even California. A California team is 
involved, but I doubt that is an explanation. You ignore plenty of interesting

EQUESTRIANS: HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HORSEBACK-RIDING 
LEAGUE FACE UPHILL BATTLE FOR RECOGNITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rumor you hear in the hallway -- that your high school really has a varsity 
horseback-riding team -- is probably true. 
</P>
<P>
Some 33 schools from Ojai to San Juan Capistrano field teams in the 
Interscholastic Equestrian League. Like football and basketball players, 
equestrians represent their schools and ride off into the sunset with varsity 
letters. But nobody comes to their matches outside the immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the cross-country team gets more school support," says Ginny Coburn, 
mother of a rider. 
</P>
<P>
One of only two high school leagues in the country (the other is in the 
Northeast), the IEL was formed eight years ago to provide teen-age riders with 
competition and recognition by their peers. But high school equestrians have 
had a rough time getting the respect they think they deserve. School principals 
and athletic directors have resisted the concept of riding as a team sport. The 
California Interscholastic Federation makes believe it doesn't exist. 
Cheerleaders don't show up at meets. And varsity jocks snub them at school. 
</P>
<P>
"The football players don't take this seriously," says Sarah Quarles, a senior 
at Calabasas High. Even though Calabasas is the defending IEL varsity champion 
and Quarles won last season's individual championship, "They don't see me as a 
varsity athlete," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But equestrians are. They compete in the Olympics and have to possess the same 
dedication and competitive fire as any athlete. Like ice skaters, they also 
need supportive parents who will nurture and chauffeur them from an early age 
on. And in many ways, jumping is more dangerous than other varsity sports. For 
parents, it can be absolutely frightening. Imagine your kid coming home and 
saying, "Mom, I'm going out for a sport and need to buy some, uh, equipment. A 
helmet, pants, boots, and, um, gulp, a horse." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, Coburn and Lynne 
Harris, Burbank neighbors, were bundled against the early morning chill, 
watching their daughters take part in the second of this season's four IEL 
competitions. It seemed like a good time to convene the local chapter of 
Parents Whose Kids Are Hooked on Horses. 
</P>
<P>
"It all began with that stupid pony ride when my daughter was 3," Ginny says 
with a wry smile. Half-jokingly, she adds, "Biggest mistake I ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Ginny's daughter Amy is now 15, a sophomore and a member -- actually, the only 
member -- of Bell-Jeff's equestrian team. What began as a lark 12 years ago has 
turned into an expensive addiction costing more per month, Ginny likes to point 
out, "than our mortgage payment." 
</P>
<P>
At 9, Amy decided to jump horses. There's a big difference between merely 
riding horses and jumping them. To get good at jumping, a rider needs to bond 
with the horse, something that doesn't happen with the swayback rental mare at 
the riding stable. Ginny and her husband, both educators, knew what this meant: 
Amy would someday want her own horse. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable happened when she turned 11. But buy a horse? What would happen 
if Amy suddenly discovered boys? You can't discard a horse like an old rag 
doll. So the Coburns compromised. They leased a horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in Southern California," Lynne Harris says, "can you lease a horse." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was 13, the Coburns realized that hormones wouldn't cure Amy. 
She was a serious horse junkie, taking a daily trip on the RTD to the 
Equestrian Center to get her fix. So the Coburns spent $6,000 for a "cheap 
horse," Ginny says about a 6-year-old stallion. And you don't get your friendly 
horse dealership to give you long-term financing and a factory rebate and throw 
in a warranty on the engine. 
</P>
<P>
"You pay cash," Ginny says. "It took every penny we had." 
</P>
<P>
But not all of the IEL competitors put their parents on the brink of poverty. 
Riding traditionally has been a sport for the wealthy, and high school riding 
is no exception. Some riders have a string of horses that specialize in each of 
the three classes (hunter, jumper, western). Amy's bargain-basement horse often 
competes against horses that cost $100,000 and up. The disparity in the quality 
of horses is one of the inequities in the sport, especially at the high school 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have an expensive horse you can do better," Ginny says. 
</P>
<P>
"Our girls have to compete against these horses that are on automatic pilot," 
says Lynne, whose daughter Stacy rides for Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
But the IEL recognizes the problem, so it tries to compensate by making the 
courses demanding for the riders. "In this league, kids who own one little old 
horse can do real well," says Dr. Paul Toffel, a Glendale plastic surgeon and 
IEL vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Toffel, whose daughter Hope was the individual champion two years ago, helped 
originate the league. In 1982, the first competition drew 44 riders from 11 
schools, all of them private. "The private schools understood the concept" of 
having an equestrian team, Toffel says. But not all of them. Ginny Coburn says 
she was caught in a bureaucratic whirlpool at Bell-Jeff before the school 
approved the equestrian team. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't want anything to do with riding because it wasn't CIF," she says. 
"They thought it would take away from the other sports at school." 
</P>
<P>
The league, course designer Merle Rose says, was once pressured by schools to 
join the CIF but decided not to try. "If you're involved with big, you're 
encumbered by rules," he says. As for the CIF, Commissioner Thomas E. Byrnes 
says riding "is not a sport in my mind, but if schools wish to engage in other 
activities, they're entitled to do so." He said that some schools even have 
rodeo and surfing as varsity sports. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance was also a problem for the IEL. "Some schools were a little bit 
reticent about insurance because they didn't understand the sport," says 
Toffel, who was U. S. Equestrian Team doctor at the 1984 Olympics. But a lot of 
parents still have to pay the $30 insurance fee at each competition. 
</P>
<P>
Today, public schools are beginning to think differently about sanctioning an 
equestrian team. About half the members of the IEL now come from the public 
ranks. There's even a growing acceptance of the sport. Amy Coburn's jumping 
exploits got a whole page in the Bell-Jeff yearbook. The Calabasas team, given 
club status at first, jumped to the varsity level last year and even 
participated in the athletic awards banquet.

<P>
Some of the best junior riders in the country compete in the IEL. Quarles from 
Calabasas and Emily Straw of Flintridge Prep are two of them. Last year they 
battled for individual league honors, with Straw coming in second to Quarles. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing school colors under their saddles at the recent Equestrian Center 
competition, they dueled in the horsemanship event, which drew about 20 
entries. Each rider (girls outnumber boys by a 10-1 margin) had to memorize the 
course and make her horse jump over a series of 3 1/2-foot fences by giving 
nonverbal commands to the 1,000-pound animal. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the entries, including Quarles and Straw, made it to the finals, where 
they had to ride without stirrups. They were advised over the P.A. system to 
jump three fences, halt their horse, back it up and then return to the line. 
After the riders completed the course, Straw was declared winner and was 
high-fived by a smiling Quarles. 
</P>
<P>
"You like your friends to do well," Quarles says. "Anyway, we just like having 
fun. You want to win for your school, but you don't want to kill each other 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
Just don't let the Calabasas football players hear you say that.

CAL POLY POMONA CHANGES VENUE AND UPSETS CSUN

<P>
Perhaps all the Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team needed was a change in 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
After three consecutive CCAA losses, two of them at home, Pomona moved Friday 
night's game against Cal State Northridge from its spacious Kellogg Gymnasium 
to cozy Poly Pavilion, the women's home court, and posted a 103-90 upset before 
812 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
And the higher decibel level generated by the capacity crowd in the smaller gym 
might have played a big role in the Broncos' victory. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped the Matadors' five-game win streak and dropped them to 9-9 
overall, 4-1 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play. Pomona is 8-10, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy scoffed at the suggestion that the change in 
court meant a change in his team's fortunes, but Pomona was a different squad 
than it had been in the previous three games, hitting 37 of 62 shots (59.6%) 
from the field, 24 of 32 (75%) free throws and outrebounding Northridge, 37-32. 
</P>
<P>
"They made us play their type of game. That was the key," Cassidy said. "They 
like to play up-tempo basketball and we let them dictate the pace of the game. 
When one team dictates the tempo almost the entire game, that team usually 
wins." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's Terry Ross, the conference's leading scorer (20.9 average) and 
rebounder (12.5), had game-high totals of 30 points (14 of 21 from the field), 
and 15 rebounds, but reserve forward Jim Skinner (19 points) made the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner had three baskets in the last two minutes of the first half to help 
Pomona take a 56-42 lead at intermission, and he helped bury the Matadors with 
three consecutive baskets, capped by a three-point shot with 12 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 65-52, with 13:21 left, Pomona went on a 12-5 run to take a 77-57 lead 
with 11:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner's trio of baskets ignited the run, and John Overbeck's three-point 
basket and Chancellor McCobb's (19 points) two-handed jam capped it. 
</P>
<P>
Jemarl Baker scored 22 points for Northridge but was held scoreless for the 
first 13 minutes of the second half after scoring 14 in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers scored 20 points and Kendell McDaniels added 15 for CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Turnovers plagued Northridge as the Matadors committed 16 in the game, 11 in 
the first half. CSUN had averaged only 10 turnovers a game in its first four 
conference games.

CLEVELAND PUTS TRACK TEAMS ON HOLD, OFFERS ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a fruitless two-month search for a qualified coach, Cleveland High has 
canceled its track season. However, athletes at the school who wish to 
participate in the sport do have recourse if they are willing to triple-jump 
through a series of obstacles that ultimately could lead to eligibility at 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
The program was canceled when a replacement for Steve Landress, a last-minute 
replacement a year ago, could not be found. Last month, Landress, the school's 
football coach, was named junior varsity baseball coach, leaving school 
administrators scrambling to find a new track coach. 
</P>
<P>
While the boys' and girls' programs were headed toward limbo, school 
administrators worked out a plan whereby track athletes at Cleveland can 
participate at a another City Section school with a track program -- if several 
provisions are met. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Kindseth, Cleveland's administrator in charge of athletics, 
the athlete would need permission of both principals and the coach at the 
second school, would be required to enroll in a sixth-period physical-education 
course at the new school and would have to provide his or her own 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"Feasibly, he could go to any school (with a track program)," Kindseth said. 
"It's not easy, but it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the athlete will be welcomed by his new coach is another matter. 
Kindseth said that the athlete would be able to participate but that any points 
earned would not count for his or her new team. Kindseth conceded that, in 
events in which limits are set regarding the number of entrants per school, 
coaches might be hesitant to enter a non-scoring athlete. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Kindseth said, only one Cleveland athlete has inquired about the 
possibility of competing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
According to Principal Ida Mae Windham, the school sought only credentialed 
applicants from throughout the L. A. Unified School District for the track 
position. 
</P>
<P>
A credentialed teacher was sought, Windham said, because of expertise required 
to supervise and train athletes in a track program. 
</P>
<P>
Windham said that Cleveland will continue to seek a coach capable of 
re-establishing the program next season. 
</P>
<P>
Landress, who last season was the third track coach in as many years, said he 
believes student interest in track might be waning -- or at the very least, 
that participation has been curtailed by a variety of factors. Last season, the 
boys' and girls' track teams combined numbered about 40, Landress said. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of money to run a track program, and a lot of schools just 
don't have the budget for that," Landress said. "And track is a different kind 
of sport where it takes a lot of different coaches because there are so many 
different events." 
</P>
<P>
However, Landress predicted that the recent relaxing of City Section 
eligibility requirements might give track a shot in the arm. Under the revised 
district rule, students participating in extracurricular activities -- 
including sports -- need only maintain a C average to remain eligible.

PBS BROADCAST OF AN ISRAELI VIEW OF INTIFADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his Jan. 16 review of the documentary "A Search for Solid Ground: The 
Intifada Through Israeli Eyes," Howard Rosenberg announces that his suspicions 
have been confirmed: "PBS has a pro-Jewish double standard" concerning the 
intifada. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that he finds the film unbalanced; indeed he finds it "more balanced" 
than the controversial "Days of Rage." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rosenberg praises "A Search," acknowledging the program's quality is 
not at issue -- a point that doesn't stop him from drawing gratuitous parallels 
between Israel and South Africa or the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rosenberg, the proof of PBS' "pro-Jewish double standard" is that 
"A Search" is accompanied by a 30-minute panel discussion, unlike the 60-minute 
wrap-around of "Days of Rage."

FACES . . . : CHANGING HER 'IMAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Baker's worked up close and personal with the De Niros, Shepards, Lemmons 
and Keatons of the world, so a little wee hours snuggling with the great Albert 
Finney didn't seem to faze her one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so down to earth. So incredibly . . . it's just hard to describe," says 
Baker of the highly revered British actor. "You know what Albert does? He 
directs, he sets up the lights, he changes the words, he's in everybody's face 
and we all love it. He's magical." 
</P>
<P>
Baker stars with Finney, John Mahoney and Marsha Mason in HBO's "The Image," 
which premieres tonight. In the made-for-cable movie, Finney portrays a TV 
muckraker a bit like "60 Minutes' " Mike Wallace with a splash of Walter 
Cronkite. America trusts this man implicitly. When a high-level banker commits 
suicide after an S&amp;L scam is exposed on Finney's segment, however, the 
shattered Finney compels himself to get the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
Baker plays the director of research in the film, but had zero time to actually 
research the role herself. "I finished 'Dad' on a Wednesday and started this on 
Friday," says Baker. "I remember the very first night shoot, like 10 at night. 
I shot this scene and when I saw the movie I could see that I was 
uncomfortable. No rehearsal, one day of costuming, hardly getting to meet 
anybody; it's very hard." 
</P>
<P>
But Baker survived and now plans to take some off-screen time to perfect her 
real-life role of mother. Down the road, Baker says she would love to be 
offered "a good comedy," but she admits to some nagging fears that invariably 
haunt actors. Will she ever work again? 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel like every actor," shudders Baker. "And I keep telling myself, 'I 
don't want to work, I have a little baby.' But at least if there was something 
in April that was signed on the dotted line. . . ." DAVID PECCHIA

<TEXT>
<P>
"Solid Ground" presents Israeli terrorists-in-uniform as soft-hearted 
youngsters forced to do "disagreeable duty" in self-defense. It paints the Arab 
world as the faceless threat to the pretty children of a beleaguered land; it 
attacks the victims of Israeli brutalities and encourages the attackers; it 
does violence to truth and justice with a callousness that brings PBS hypocrisy 
to a new low. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the TV broadcast is to perpetuate Israeli oppression by 
misrepresenting the intifada to Americans and by creating an atmosphere in 
which the United States can continue to fund repression and rights violations.

THE FOOL'S PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was perplexed to read that theater critic Sylvie Drake, in her Jan. 22 
review, was disturbed that the Fool had been cut out of the Dover scenes in the 
Renaissance Theatre Company's production of "King Lear." In my longtime study 
of this masterwork, I have never found a version of the play that had the Fool 
appear at Dover. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Branagh's production quite properly has the Fool expire on the heath. 
By moving the final speech of Act III, Scene 2 -- the Fool's prophecy about the 
fate of "the realm of Albion" -- to the end of Act I and by having the Fool 
pass his coxcomb on to Edgar, the Fool's death becomes a palpable landmark of 
the new stage of Lear's journey through madness.

LATC FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's opposition to continuation of major city 
subsidies for the Los Angeles Theatre Center, quoted in "Stage Watch" on Jan. 
11: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yaroslavasky: How about a half-cent arts tax on corporate earnings in Los 
Angeles to fund the theaters? How about collecting the outstanding major 
pollution infraction fines and earmarking them to fund the theaters? How about 
suggesting alternative measures to fund the theaters? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are people sleeping in the streets, but funds to help them should 
not come from the arts and culture budgets. Theaters enhance the quality of 
life; LATC is one of L.A.'s few professional theaters. We need more, not less.

Donna Perlmutter's Jan. 4 interview with Erich Leinsdorf was read with serious 
misgivings. In the first place I reject his ranting against dodecaphonic music. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to have forgotten that about 1960 he had planned to produce with the 
Boston Symphony in Tanglewood my stage work "Charles V," a full-length opera (2 
1/2 hours) written from the first to the last tone in the 12-tone technique. 
The project was not realized because he quit the Boston Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
He also forgets that he conducted the premiere of the original version of this 
work in 1984 at the Vienna Opera House (whose orchestra is identical with the 
Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra). We obtained a half-hour's standing ovation from 
a sold-out house. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, this was exactly 50 years after this work had been commissioned 
and then rejected by the same opera house because it was classified by the 
already rampant Nazis as "degenerate music." 
</P>
<P>
When the opera was resumed two years later, Leinsdorf refused to conduct it, 
supposedly because he was not granted sufficient rehearsing time. A substitute, 
Guenter Lehmann, who had assisted him two years earlier, took over and did an 
equally excellent job.

RAMPAL FLUTE RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal's appearance at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday 
evening added little that was especially notable to his outstanding, 44-year 
career. Although it is evident that he is still a commanding virtuoso, the 
evening was not without problems. 
</P>
<P>
His frequent sniffling and coughing between movements indicated that the 
68-year-old Frenchman was suffering from a cold. The ailment undoubtedly 
contributed to a general lack of concentration and weak tone throughout most of 
the first half of the recital, dedicated to sonatas by Handel and Leclair. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the spirited attention Rampal gave Telemann's Sonata in F affirmed his 
reputation as an enthusiast of the Baroque era, though not a purist. His style 
of precise phrasing, consistent in every octave and dynamic level, continues to 
offer dazzling displays, not sacrificing refinement. 
</P>
<P>
The only 20th-Century offering, David Diamond's Sonata (1986-87), added mild 
spice to a program that otherwise offered few surprises. Written for Rampal, 
the four-movement, neo-classic study playfully deals with an austere choice of 
melodic elements, sometimes overstating them. 
</P>
<P>
Rampal gave the work an apt reading, soaring through difficult passages 
competently. 
</P>
<P>
John Steele Ritter offered reliable, steady accompaniment on the piano. His 
work on harpsichord during the Baroque set also impressed with his seamless 
phrasings and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
The sumptuousness of Kuhlau's Introduction and Rondo, Opus 98, and extended 
techniques of Akio Yashiro's quirky flute arrangement of Antonio Bazzini's 
violin show-piece "Le ronde des lutins" proved flashy additions. Three encores 
of popular classics completed the program. GREGG WAGER

PACIFIC SERENADES OPENS SEASON AT CLARK LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing a new work as eclectic may seem backhanded, like calling a singer's 
figure ample or an instrumentalist's technique careful. But it needn't be so. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the fourth consecutive season of Pacific Serenades, impresario Mark 
Carlson put together a wonderful and accomplished trio of musicians in a 
program combining the innocent joys of Mendelssohn's Sonata in D for cello and 
piano with the darker beauties of Brahms' Trio, Opus 114. 
</P>
<P>
Between these, he placed his own "The Hall of Mirrors" for clarinet and piano, 
a work recently completed, and dated: 1990. 
</P>
<P>
It is a piece tightly structured and wound around itself, self-absorbed in a 
positive sense, tuneful, heartfelt in its controlled sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
And harmonically old-fashioned, its ninth chords, jazzy modes and 
post-Straussian chromaticism placing it, stylewise, somewhere near the end of 
the 1940s, years before Carlson was born, and nearly five decades before its 
actual writing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a most attractive and engaging work, as the Thursday night 
performance by clarinetist Gary Gray and pianist Delores Stevens proved. 
Eclecticism in this case does not preclude genuine success at reaching and 
touching the listener, and giving that listener what seems like a fresh 
emotional experience. "The Hall of Mirrors" deserves a wide hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of this season-opening performance, at the William Andrews Clark 
Memorial Library on West Adams, showed Stevens, Gray and cellist Stephen Erdody 
in top form, which is saying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
In the Mendelssohn sonata, pianist and cellist achieved abundant beauties and 
urgent Romantic statement with ease, Erdody's full, gorgeous and plangent tone 
ringing expressively through the Clark Library auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Brahms' melancholy Opus 114 found the three players in complete accord: This 
performance -- not immaculate but pristine -- delivered the entire range of 
feelings the deceptively straightforward piece may contain. DANIEL CARIAGA

QUALITY REMAINS HIGH AS 'NARNIA' RESUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a year's hiatus, the myth, magic and high adventure of C. S. Lewis' "The 
Chronicles of Narnia" resume on PBS' "Wonderworks" with the three-part "Prince 
Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader" (beginning tonight at 8 on Channel 
15 and Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 28). 
</P>
<P>
Fans who enjoyed last year's exceptional debut of "The Lion, the Witch and the 
Wardrobe" have waited a long time for the return of this multimillion-dollar 
BBC series. 
</P>
<P>
With one caveat, they won't be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Part I is a kaleidoscope of dwarfs and talking beasts, evil-doers, sword-play, 
four English children and the crowning of a boy king. Good fun, but the 
frenetic pace may confuse viewers who missed last year's segment. That was when 
the children -- Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan -- first entered the magic world 
of Narnia and, aided by its spiritual leader, the lion Aslan, overthrew a 
wicked witch and ruled in her stead. 
</P>
<P>
Parts II and III, however, offer a thoroughly marvelous telling of a quest to 
the edge of Narnia, aboard the ship Dawn Treader. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy and Edmund are back, with Eustace, a bratty cousin. (Peter and Susan 
appear only in Part I; they have outgrown Narnia.) With Caspian and his crew of 
men, dwarfs and a talking mouse, they brave unknown seas and enchanted islands. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech gloss is refreshingly absent; the special effects and mechanics have 
an appealing stage-play look. The cast is splendid -- Sophie Wilcox is again a 
standout as heroic Lucy -- and Alan Seymour's adaptation is captivating. It's a 
voyage well worth taking.

Super Bowl XXIV is far from the only game on television this weekend, with 
attractive events in golf, college basketball and hockey also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, 50, gets to pick on golfers his own age when he makes his 
Seniors debut in the Seniors Skins game, seen on a delayed basis today at 1 
p.m. and Sunday at noon on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
The other competitors are Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
In college basketball, No. 23 UCLA plays host to Pacific 10 Conference leader 
Oregon State, ranked 17th by the Associated Press, at 3 p.m. on Channel 2. A 
victory would give the Bruins a share of the conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, in the midst of a 1-7-2 stretch during a season fast proving to be 
the most disappointing in their 23-year history, entertain former teammate 
Bernie Nicholls and the New York Rangers tonight at 7:30 p.m with Prime Ticket 
telecasting the game live from the sold-out Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers have the weekend off, their two closest Pacific Division 
rivals have television dates. The second place Portland Trail Blazers head into 
the Sports Arena to face the Clippers in a 7:30 p.m. SportsChannel telecast 
tonight. The National Basketball Association's hottest team, the Phoenix Suns, 
face the Boston Celtics Sunday at 9:30 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and the Super Bowl? Sunday at 2 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. STEVEN HERBERT

Photo, Vatican Telescope The structure designed for the first Vatican-owned 
telescope outside of Italy passed various stress and motion tests this week in 
Huntington Park, said Father Christopher Corbally, above, principal scientist 
on the project. The prototype of new telescopes being built by University of 
Arizona engineers, the new Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope will be put in 
place on Arizona's Mt. Graham in the fall. Five of the nine Jesuit 
priest-astronomers attached to the Vatican Observatory have worked primarily 
out of Tucson, reserving telescope time at other observatories. They will 
control three-fourths of the observing time at the new telescope. RANDY

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SENSE OF HUMOR IS NO MEAN JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 19-year-old son has a wonderful sense of humor, but he 
sometimes uses it to attack his sister and his grandmother. He always claims 
he's only teasing, but his barbs hurt. Whenever I try to talk with him 
seriously about anything, he turns what I'm saying into a joke. Obviously, this 
makes serious conversation difficult. -- B.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.D.: While it's true that there's usually some hostility in all humor, 
people who use humor to attack are like hit-and-run drivers: They escape by 
claiming they were only kidding and often end up blaming the victim for not 
having a good sense of humor. It's important to put a stop to this pattern and 
to point out to your son that what he's doing is cowardly and cruel. 
</P>
<P>
If he's angry with his sister or his grandmother, then he should discuss the 
problem directly without masking his aggression in humor. Whatever it is that 
disturbs him in these relationships won't be solved until he uses a more 
honest, constructive approach. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 5-year-old son has a terrible fear of dogs. My boyfriend 
wants to get him a puppy for his birthday because he thinks this will get him 
over his fear immediately. I'm not so sure. What's your view? -- R.C.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR R.C.J.: The key to overcoming any fear such as this is to do it gradually. 
I believe it would be a mistake to bring a pet into your son's life until he 
feels more secure. This will take time. It would be fine to take him to visit a 
cuddly puppy and see if he'd like to try stroking the dog's fur. If he's 
frightened and doesn't wish to do this, his wishes should be respected. No one 
should make fun of him or force him. It might even be a good idea to start him 
out with a toy puppy, one that's soft and has a coat that feels like fur. This 
might be a totally non-threatening way to introduce him to what a real puppy 
might be like. 
</P>
<P>
I'm wondering if you know the source of your son's fear of dogs. If he was 
attacked or frightened by a dog, encourage him to talk about this experience. 
Let him know that fear is normal but that it's possible to conquer our fears so 
that they don't cripple us or limit our freedom. 
</P>
<P>
You might also take him to a children's zoo where he can see other children 
touching and petting the animals. Again, however, if he doesn't want to join 
them, don't force him. Eventually, if this is handled with sensitivity, he may 
welcome a new puppy, but wait until he's ready.

BOB GREENE: BRIDE'S LOSES ITS READERS BUT HAS NO COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the magazine business, the phrase hot book is tossed around quite a bit. A 
"hot book" is a magazine that is doing especially well -- picking up 
circulation, selling lots of ads. "Hot books" are generally perceived as being 
hip, ultra-cool, on the cutting edge of fashion and social style. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it is interesting to note that a certain magazine has just 
published the biggest single issue in the history of consumer magazines. The 
magazine contains 1,034 pages -- think about that -- and is stuffed with 
advertising. A hot book, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
And what is this magazine? 
</P>
<P>
Bride's. 
</P>
<P>
That's correct -- Bride's magazine. The current issue, with its 1,034 pages, is 
bigger than the Seattle telephone book. Bride's, which has been around for 56 
years, is seldom mentioned as a hot magazine. 
</P>
<P>
After all, instead of covering the newest after-hours Manhattan clubs, or the 
most talked-about performance artists in New York, Bride's features stories 
with titles such as "Beautiful Bouquets" and "Watch Out! Don't Let Dry Cleaning 
Ruin Your Wedding Gown." But apparently the audience is there; at $5 per copy, 
Bride's expects to sell 600,000 copies of the latest issue. 
</P>
<P>
I got in touch with Millie Martini Bratten, associate editor of Bride's, who 
said that other people might be surprised at the hugeness of the magazine -- 
but to her and other staff members, it makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
"For starters, every issue of our magazine is really three magazines in one," 
she said. "We help couples go through the engagement period and plan their 
wedding. Then there's a part of each issue that talks about romantic honeymoon 
destinations -- that part of our magazine is bigger than most travel magazines. 
And a third part of each issue is about when the new bride and groom arrive 
home and set up house." 
</P>
<P>
But all magazines try to compartmentalize -- if compartmentalization was the 
whole story, every magazine would be as bulky as Bride's. Obviously, there is 
something else going on. 
</P>
<P>
"There is," Bratten said. "Unlike some other magazines, Bride's is not seen as 
a whim to its readers. They want that information right now." 
</P>
<P>
The readers of Bride's are women -- and some men -- who are planning to get 
married. Because of this, the readership is constantly vanishing and then being 
replaced. The magazine's editors have studied this. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a complete turnover in readership every seven or eight issues," 
Bratten said. The magazine is printed every other month -- six times a year. 
"Fifteen months is the length of the average engagement," she said. If that 
seems long to you, trust her -- the people at Bride's seem to know everything 
there is to know about weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"The average wedding costs $13,021," she said. "That's for the clothing, the 
ceremony and reception -- everything but the honeymoon. The average honeymoon 
is $2,515." 
</P>
<P>
And the reason the magazine is so fat with ads, she said, is that Bride's is 
being read by an audience that does not have to be persuaded to part with its 
money. "Our advertisers know that our readers will be buying a great deal of 
goods and services over a fairly brief period of time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, the success of Bride's does not have as much to do with 
demographics or advertising reach as it does with something more intangible. 
</P>
<P>
"For everything that has changed in our world, a wedding is still the most 
important day in a woman's life," Bratten said. "A wedding is pageantry, it is 
a multigenerational celebration. Brides-to-be still have an ideal of what they 
want their weddings to be. They want their weddings to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
In these allegedly cynical times, those words might seem out of date to some. 
But just as the readership of Bride's completely replaces itself every 15 
months, so too new generations of starry-eyed brides-to-be keep coming along. 
It never stops. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to a friend of mine who lives in Los Angeles," Bratten said. 
"She's 42, she's very successful, and she's getting married for the first time. 
And she's just like a schoolgirl. She tells me, 'I've waited so long for this 
-- I want everything to be just so. I want everyone who loves me, and everyone 
I love, to be at the wedding.' " 
</P>
<P>
After which she will undoubtedly stop reading Bride's. To be replaced 
immediately by someone else who at this very moment might not even know what 
her new favorite magazine will soon be.

Opposition groups agreed to join the beleaguered Communist government if East 
German Prime Minister Hans Modrow and his Cabinet agree to deactivate their 
party memberships until the May 6 elections. Modrow indicated that he is 
willing to discuss the proposal at negotiations scheduled for Monday. The 
proposal came from an all-day meeting in East Berlin of more than a dozen 
opposition groups after a party allied with the Communists threatened to pull 
out of the government.

The Polish Parliament rejected a bill to confiscate property worth tens of 
millions of dollars from the Communist Party after the Solidarity-led 
government refused to back the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Sejm (lower house) voted 246-20 with 45 abstentions to drop the bill. The 
Sejm did approve setting up a government commission to investigate the wealth 
of the Communist Party and its former allies and said it should find ways to 
ensure the return of property taken illegally from the state and other owners. 
The Communists, who plan to disband and form a new, non-Marxist party, have 
said the party has property worth $73 million.

Robert Freeman, the suspended superintendent of the Camp Hill, Pa., prison has 
been fired for his actions during a three-day riot last year that left 123 
people injured and more than half the institution in ruins. The dismissals of 
Freeman and Robert Smith, the prison's deputy for operations, were based on a 
recommendation by Gov. Robert P. Casey, who said that Freeman was among the 
officials with primary responsibility for maintaining order.

In an unprecedented ruling, a federal judge overturned a ban on begging in the 
New York City subway system, saying panhandling was a form of free speech 
protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"While often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic, begging is 
unmistakenly informative and persuasive speech," U.S. District Judge Leonard 
Sand wrote in his 42-page ruling. The ruling was hailed by lawyers for two 
homeless men who brought the class-action suit against the Transit Authority, 
the agency that operates the city's subways. A spokesman for the Transit 
Authority's parent agency said it was "obviously upset with the decision."

<P>
Formal disciplinary charges have been lodged against two Lutheran congregations 
that violated denominational policy by ordaining three gay ministers who refuse 
to renounce sexual relations. St. Francis and First United churches face 
punishment ranging from censure to expulsion from the church organization for 
"willfully disregarding" membership requirements of the 5.2-million-member 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Jeff Johnson, 27, was installed Sunday 
as assistant pastor at First United. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, were installed at 
St. Francis, near the predominantly gay Castro neighborhood. The ELCA bans 
ordination of "self-avowed, practicing homosexuals." A consultation team will 
be named to meet with the congregations. If the group cannot resolve the 
dispute, a 12-member disciplinary committee will review the charges.

<P>
The state Senate approved legislation Friday that would require crane operators 
to be licensed by a new three-member board, a move inspired by the deaths of 
six people in the collapse of an industrial crane in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) would set up a new board within 
the Division of Occupational Safety and Health to license crane operators. The 
board would have the authority to set testing procedures for several classes of 
cranes, including the giant machines used in high-rise construction. Last 
November, a crane on a San Francisco building collapsed, killing crane workers 
and bystanders.

ECONOMY AT A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: THE QUARTERLY GNP GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ONLY 0.5%. BUT ANALYSTS 
SEE AN UPTURN AND SAY THAT A RECESSION APPEARS UNLIKELY.

<P>
The growth of the nation's economy slowed virtually to a halt late last year, 
the government reported Friday, but analysts said a recession still seems 
unlikely and the economic expansion should pick up again soon, albeit at a 
sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department figures showed the economy's output grew at an annual rate 
of only 0.5% during the final three months of 1989 after adjusting for 
inflation -- down from a 3% rate during the previous quarter and the lowest 
recorded since the spring of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, the nation's gross national product rose a moderate 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown partly reflected temporary factors, such as the impact of the San 
Francisco earthquake last October, the Boeing strike in mid-winter and the 
unusually cold weather, which kept consumers indoors and interrupted barge 
traffic and construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Darby, the department's chief economist, estimated that without those 
setbacks, the economy would have grown at a 1% rate during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And companion figures published by the Commerce Department showed that new 
orders for durable goods rose 2.5% in December, another sign that some momentum 
remains in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Friday's report seemed certain to fuel debate over whether the 
nation is heading into a full-fledged recession, intensifying pressure on the 
Federal Reserve Board to ease the tight anti-inflation stance that it has 
maintained since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, 
sidestepped a potential opportunity to criticize the Fed during a briefing for 
reporters Friday, but White House officials hinted as recently as last week 
that they hoped the Fed would ease its credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
Boskin said that he still believes a recession is "unlikely" and that the 
economy "should be growing more rapidly than it is now" by midyear. Even so, 
Boskin and Budget Director Richard G. Darman both have been pressing the Fed to 
push interest rates down further. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle called the fourth-quarter figures disappointing. 
"These numbers this morning were not what we had hoped for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the strike impact, the fourth-quarter figures were in line with 
expectations. Economists have been predicting for months that the economy would 
slow markedly during late 1989 and early 1990 and then speed up moderately by 
late spring or early summer. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, 
proffered a view expressed by many private economists. "The basic message is 
that the aggregate economy is sluggish, and it isn't going to stop being 
sluggish in the current quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most sweeping change in the economy in the last quarter came from a 
slowing in consumer spending, which edged down by $800 million, or 0.1%, after 
a rise of $36.4 billion, or 5.6%, between July and September. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the decline reflected a falloff in auto sales. Spending on durable 
goods plunged 12.9% during the period, after an 11.3% rise in the previous 
quarter. Outlays for non-durables dipped only 1.4%, after a 5% rise during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the slowing was evident virtually throughout the economy. Outlays for 
business fixed investment fell 3% during the quarter, after a 5.2% rise in the 
previous period. And net exports, whose gains buoyed the economy during earlier 
periods, slumped by $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Even the gains seemed to mask signs of potential weakness. For example, the 
figures showed a major source of strength in the economy was the buildup of 
business inventories, particularly in apparel and other non-durables. 
</P>
<P>
But Lynn Reaser, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, 
cautioned that the increase, which reflected sluggish sales, was actually "a 
red flag" because it most likely would reduce orders in coming months, 
exacerbating the weakness in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the figures showed that inflation continued its slow, but 
steady rise. The index used in the report -- considered the broadest measure of 
inflation -- showed prices rising at an annual rate of 3.8% during the period, 
up from a 2.9% pace in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for all of 1989 totaled 4.5%, up from 4.2% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The December increase in new orders for durable goods was stronger than some 
analysts had expected. The 2.5% rise, which followed a 4.9% increase the 
previous month, brought the volume of new orders to $133.5 billion, up $3.2 
billion from the November level. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the new orders was concentrated in aircraft, shipbuilding 
equipment and electrical machinery. Orders of motor vehicles, non-electrical 
machinery and primary metals all posted declines. 
</P>
<P>
And orders for defense-related goods plunged $3.3 billion, or 29.2%, after an 
18.9% gain in November. 
</P>
<P>
The December rise brought the gain for all of 1989 to 5.9%, or $1.52 trillion, 
the lowest increase since 1986. By contrast, orders soared by 10.9% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter figures on output brought the GNP, or total value of goods 
and services that the nation produces, to $4.168 trillion, up from $4.069 
trillion a year before. Friday's figures were preliminary and are subject to 
major revision.

BUSH PROPOSES 36% FUNDS HIKE FOR HEAD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush, in a surprise announcement, disclosed Friday that he will seek 
a $500-million increase in government funding next year for Head Start, a 
25-year-old program intended to help disadvantaged youngsters prepare for 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the proposed 36% jump in federal spending is intended to expand the 
program -- one of the few remaining elements of Lyndon B. Johnson's War on 
Poverty -- so it can reach 70% of the disadvantaged 4-year-olds in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the draft $1.23-trillion federal budget for the fiscal year that 
begins next Oct. 1, Bush is expected to propose $37 billion in spending cuts 
and revenue increases to meet a congressionally mandated deficit-reduction 
target of $64 billion next year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget -- Bush's first full-scale statement of his priorities for the 
federal government -- will include a renewed call for a lower capital gains tax 
rate, tax credits for adoptions and for child care, and a proposed "family 
savings account" that would allow people to accumulate tax-free earnings on up 
to $5,000 put away each year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the package contains no general tax hikes, it is expected to include 
as much as $12 billion in various revenue increases that would take money out 
of people's pockets, including $5 billion in proposed user fees. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for further cuts in Pentagon spending after adjusting for 
inflation, but Congress is expected to demand even deeper savings. Bush's 
spending blueprint will call for modest savings of about $3.8 billion from 
holding defense outlays to $292 billion next year, compared to the $286 billion 
total for this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood, who briefed congressional staff 
members Friday, called the Pentagon's budget request "realistic" and said its 
efforts to scale back its budget in the next five years deserve support. 
</P>
<P>
In tentative spending plans for the next five years, the Pentagon has proposed 
to reduce its budget by 2% annually after accounting for inflation, which would 
allow only a gradual rise from $292 billion next year to $311.8 billion in 
fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had slated a long 
list of relatively small weapons and ordnance programs for termination. None of 
the Pentagon's most costly programs, including the B-2 Stealth bomber -- for 
which $5.5 billion will be sought in 1991 -- were killed or scaled back 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is certain to raise hackles on Capitol Hill with decisions not to seek 
additional funds for production or development of the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey 
tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy F-14 fighter jet. The Pentagon last year 
proposed to terminate both programs, prompting angry lawmakers to restore some 
funds to keep the programs alive. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also contains about $5 billion in proposed Medicare savings, along 
with another $2.5 billion from yet another Administration attempt to require 
state and local workers to pay for Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about 18 or 19 programs would be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ledger, Bush is expected to call for increased 
spending on the environment, particularly a stepped-up program to combat global 
warming, and a boost in spending on space, drug enforcement and treatment, and 
AIDS research and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
The overall education budget would rise by $500 million, but not enough to keep 
up with inflation. As a result, some college students would lose their 
eligibility for Pell Grants, and others would be required to accept smaller 
stipends. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,592-page budget document was in its final press run on Friday, said Donna 
Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Government Printing Office. Some 24,000 of the 
blue-jacketed documents are being printed, and they will go on sale Monday at 
government book shops for $38 each. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, his aides, and other government officials have carefully disclosed most 
of the key elements on his agenda this year. He will be free in the State of 
the Union address Wednesday evening to focus on the overall direction he would 
like to see the country take this year, rather than having to present a 
"laundry list" of problems and programs. 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the Head Start funding proposal to an audience of adopted 
children and parents taking part in a White House program on adoption, Bush 
said he would seek "the largest increase ever -- half a billion additional 
dollars -- for Head Start." 
</P>
<P>
"This new funding will increase the Head Start enrollment to 667,000 children 
and bring us to the point where we can reach 70% of this nation's disadvantaged 
4-year-olds through Head Start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said "every American child with special needs, whether physical, 
emotional, or material, deserves the opportunity for a full and happy life." 
</P>
<P>
The increase is approximately 10 times as big as the additional amount sought 
for the program by the Department of Health and Human Services, White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The President's announcement surprised advocates of assistance for children and 
Democratic politicians, with one Democratic political adviser remarking: 
"That's smart politics." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who said frequently during the 1988 political campaign that he wanted to 
become the "education" President, had come under increasing pressure to move 
toward that goal by increasing federal funding for a variety of education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Such pressure emerged at the meeting Bush led at the University of Virginia 
last September, where he conferred with the nation's governors on education 
needs across the country. Fitzwater said the Head Start proposal stemmed 
directly from that conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Head Start program grew steadily during the Ronald Reagan Administration 
from about $800 million in 1981 to about $1.2 billion when he left office. In 
1990, the Head Start program is receiving $1.386 billion. It provides early 
educational skills, health care and social counseling for preschool children 
from families living at or below the poverty level. Staff writer Melissa Healy 
contributed to this story.

PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO MEDFLY SPRAYING HAS SUDDENLY GROWN FROM NEIGHBORHOOD 
GRUMBLING INTO AN ORGANIZED POLITICAL MOVEMENT.

<P>
Actress Rue McClanahan of the hit television series "The Golden Girls" was 
shooting a new movie in Norwalk last month when she first heard the ominous 
whup-whup-whup of helicopters above her. 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan and most of the film crew were inside a building at the time, but 
she winced at the bitter smell of malathion swirling around her in the night. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, McClanahan stood defiantly at a noisy protest in downtown 
Los Angeles with actor Jon Cypher of "Hill Street Blues" and 150 other 
demonstrators, singing to the tune of "Frere Jacques": "Malathion, malathion, 
fills the air, they don't care. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by just two celebrities, the organizers of a demonstration a 
week later in West Los Angeles called in six cast members of the television 
show "Cheers," including Ted Danson (Sam the bartender), Kirstie Alley (Rebecca 
the bar manager) and Rhea Perlman (Carla the waitress). 
</P>
<P>
The cast spoke to the crowd, mugged for the TV news cameras and then took off, 
leaving a gaggle of gas-mask clad demonstrators to march on to Westwood 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's really taking off," crowed Michael Bell, an organizer of the event. 
"I'm feeling flush at this point. Stars are sexy. They give us entree, like a 
skeleton key to power." 
</P>
<P>
In a town where a protest isn't a protest until Hollywood turns out, the 
opposition to malathion spraying has blossomed into a potent force, replete 
with ample supplies of sign-waving demonstrators, political backing and, of 
course, celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, the complaints about spraying were barely an annoying buzz 
around the ears of state officials engrossed in their aggressive air campaign 
to combat the 372-square-mile Medfly infestation -- the largest in Southern 
California's history. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the only public official who took a stand against spraying was 
Monterey Park Mayor Pat Reichenberger, who peppered fly eradication officials 
with a barrage of complaints. At one demonstration in Orange County last month, 
just two people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
But in just the last few weeks, public opposition to malathion spraying has 
grown from a grumbling neighborhood affair to an increasingly organized 
political movement. 
</P>
<P>
State officials fear that this increasingly visible movement of celebrities, 
politicians and neighborhood protesters could force an end to spraying and 
allow the pesky Medfly to spread throughout the state -- a disastrous prospect 
that they say would result in up to$200 million in crop losses, higher fruit 
prices and millions lost because of quarantines on California fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, conceded that every time the helicopters take off for their 
nighttime forays, the state inches closer to losing the hearts and minds of the 
public below. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that before it gets there, we will be able to eradicate this thing 
and get out of L.A.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui believes that the Southern California Medfly war will be over by June. 
</P>
<P>
But for opponents of aerial malathion spraying, who maintain that the 
pesticide, even in minute doses, can cause neurological damage, diarrhea, 
rashes and a host of other ailments, the spraying has already gone on for too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California demonstrations in the last month have drawn up to 150 
people, talk of a fruit boycott to protest the spraying is building and a savvy 
coalition of grass-roots groups has even set up a toll-free malathion hot line: 
1-800-GO-TOXIN. 
</P>
<P>
City councils in Monterey Park, Duarte, Huntington Beach, Garden Grove, 
Westminster, Brea and Cypress, as well as the Los Angeles and San Marino school 
boards, have taken formal action in just the last two weeks demanding an end to 
malathion spraying or urging the state to rely on alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster filed suit 
against the state Thursday, seeking an injunction against malathion spraying in 
their cities that night. A Sacramento judge rejected the request, but the 
cities vowed to continue filing suits until the spraying stops. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was an uphill battle," said Marilyn Wiczynski, Garden Grove's deputy 
city attorney. "But we're not going to stop." 
</P>
<P>
In what has been the most serious political attack to date, state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) unveiled two bills Tuesday that would effectively stop 
the state's aerial campaign by banning repeated malathion spraying and 
requiring proof of the safety and effectiveness of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
While the bills face certain warfare in the Legislature, Torres said at least 
it sends a signal to spraying supporters and state bureaucrats that the easy 
days of spraying are over. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the end of our quiet frustration and resignation," said Torres, 
chairman of the Senate Toxics and Public Safety Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The anger over malathion spraying is nothing new to California. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans of the 1980-82 Medfly war in Northern California recall helicopters 
being shot at by disgruntled homeowners, Red Cross evacuation centers being set 
up to shelter spray zone refugees, and even some residents sobbing in the 
street for fear of what malathion might do. 
</P>
<P>
That infestation -- still the largest in the state's history -- spread to over 
1,496 square miles in eight counties and required as many as 24 sprayings in 
some spots. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, a veteran of that earlier Medfly war, said 17 cities officially 
banned aerial spraying over their turf during that infestation. The state went 
ahead and sprayed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Jose went so far as to ban state helicopters from its airport. 
The state then shifted its takeoffs and landings to a Catholic cemetery and 
kept the location secret for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen demonstrations with 5,000 people," said Siddiqui, adding that he has 
received only about 175 letters complaining about the current spraying program 
-- a minor outcry compared to the Northern California Medfly war. 
</P>
<P>
But Siddiqui's boss, Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss, said he is 
always concerned that the opposition could stop the spraying. With at least six 
more months of spraying to go, Voss said, there is plenty of time for outrage 
to build. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we do this, the temperature goes up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department maintains that malathion is safe in the minute doses used in 
aerial spraying. In fact, state officials say, it's safer than a standard pet 
flea collar. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health 
have both cleared the use of malathion for aerial spraying, saying that the 
amount used -- about 2.4 ounces per acre -- poses no significant danger to 
humans, Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is a pesticide commonly used by the agricultural industry and home 
gardeners to kill such insects as aphis, red spider mites, mealybugs, leaf 
hoppers, fleas and houseflies. The warning label on a bottle of malathion spray 
cautions users not to swallow or inhale the pesticide in concentrated form. 
</P>
<P>
But its defenders say that it is one of the safest pesticides in existence and, 
when diluted to the level used in aerial spraying, is harmless to humans. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, B. T. Collins, then director of the California Conservation Corps, 
tried to drive that point home by drinking a glass of diluted malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The mere mention of Collins' performance today evokes sighs of pity from 
anti-malathion protesters. "God, I hope he wasn't planning on having children," 
one said recently. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of nine years has only intensified opposition to aerial spraying, 
which took place in parts of Southern California in 1980, 1981 and 1982 and 
again in 1987, 1988, 1989 and now 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of aerial malathion spraying say that while people may be willing to 
accept occasional fly wars, four straight years have been enough to raise 
doubts about the efficiency and safety of the sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of a single Medfly in Elysian Park last July 20, about 50 
cities have been sprayed, some as many as four times, according to eradication 
program spokeswoman Anita Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Affected areas are now sprayed every 21 days, but that will jump to every 15 
days in April, and then every seven days in June if the infestation continues. 
State officials figure that some cities may be sprayed as many as 12 times by 
the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the state has got to come through and say that there is a deadline," 
said Pasadena Mayor William Thomson. "If they don't do that, we, like a lot of 
other cities, will reach the saturation point and say, 'No more.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rising out of this sticky malathion goo has been a veritable alphabet soup of 
protest groups, such as Safe Alternatives to Fruit Fly Eradication (SAFE), 
Citizens Against Urban Spraying (CAUS), Residents Against Spraying Pesticide 
(RASP), Coalition Against Malathion and Garden Grove Residents Against 
Malathion Spraying (GGRAM). 
</P>
<P>
A cadre of veteran activists from a variety of causes celebres have jumped into 
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Rosin, a speaker at several rallies, was one of the leading opponents 
against the Star Wars space defense system; Phyllis Rabins, a CAUS member, has 
been a perennial gadfly in the battle to clean up the Operating Industries 
landfill in Monterey Park, and SAFE's Michael Bell is a longtime animal rights 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
But many demonstrators had never been involved in an issue before they saw the 
tiny malathion drops on their cars or heard the thundering flights of 
helicopters overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Hinsley, a Norwalk housewife and a sales representative for a fashion 
company, said it was only after she got sick after a night of spraying that she 
launched into her campaign against malathion. Hinsley polled 100 households in 
her neighborhood to see if they suffered from the same problems, and later 
organized a demonstration on a busy corner of Rosecrans Avenue. Only 20 people 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt futile," she said. "At the time, it was a little discouraging. Lonely 
would be an accurate term." 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Mayor Reichenberger, who declares that she is no environmentalist 
and is proud to be a smoker, said she became involved after her son felt ill 
after one night of spraying. 
</P>
<P>
She had received "just a couple of complaints" from constituents before then, 
but she felt angry enough to start her own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt so strongly about it," she said. "I had never paid much attention 
to it before." 
</P>
<P>
Reichenberger has become one of the more visible figures coordinating the 
political opposition to malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Since she became involved, the mayor has appeared before 15 city councils 
(including her own, which passed a resolution Monday demanding an end to 
malathion spraying), 35 neighborhood groups and appeared on television four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
At least six cities have passed measures against spraying since Reichenberger 
began her campaign in November. Officials in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, 
Pasadena, Norwalk, Monrovia, Burbank, Anaheim and Laguna Beach are also 
considering various actions in the next few weeks. As a sign of the building 
momentum, even cities that haven't had a single drop of malathion fall on their 
soil, such as Pomona, have jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't prove it's safe, we don't want to be guinea pigs down here," 
said Pomona Mayor Donna Rice, who has already sent a letter of protest to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Resolutions and ordinances are only symbolic gestures since the state's 
authority to spray under a state of emergency declared last August by Gov. 
George Deukmejian overrides any local authority. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is one area where the opposition has managed to score a victory, 
it is in the battle of the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-malathion forces are led by publicity-shy Los Angeles County 
Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy and state Food and Agriculture director 
Voss, who are about as visible as a Medfly in deep winter. 
</P>
<P>
But bring out Ted Danson or Kirstie Alley -- now you've got a media event. 
</P>
<P>
"We bring them out for the same reason People magazine puts them on the cover," 
said Doretta Zemp, the head of Coalition Against Malathion. "Let's face it, 
sports and entertainment people are like royalty in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Zemp said she managed to get six members of the "Cheers" cast at Tuesday's West 
Los Angeles demonstration because of John Ratzenberger, who portrays Cliff the 
mailman on the series. The actor has been a longtime supporter of environmental 
issues and markets a biodegradable packing material called Eco-Pack. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the demonstration, Ratzenberger asked one of the show's 
assistants to call Zemp. "You have any celebrities?" the assistant asked. 
</P>
<P>
Zemp jumped at the chance. "It's what the general public wants," she said. 
"They want a king and queen." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the celebrities have a longstanding involvement in environmental 
issues. Consider Danson, who founded the American Oceans Campaign, an 
environmental group advocating the protection of the oceans and sea life. 
</P>
<P>
Danson told the anti-malathion rally: "I'm not really here to make a huge 
statement today. I'm here to educate myself. (But) something does not feel 
right. You have to admit it's a little strange that you have to run out and 
cover your pools and your sandboxes and tape your windows." 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of their backgrounds in environmental issues, the value of the 
celebrities, Zemp said, is that they are simply listened to, as Cypher proved 
at Sen. Torres' press conference Tuesday at Huntington Drive Elementary School 
in El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
After Torres announced his two bills to stop repeated aerial sprayings, several 
speakers, including Cypher, took center stage before the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"As Chief Daniels, I know a lot about cover-up," he said in a stern, cop-like 
voice. "I charge them (state officials) with covering up the information you 
will hear today." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 100 parents, schoolchildren and community activists broke 
out in cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Cypher, whose Mt. Washington neighborhood has been sprayed several times, was 
followed at the microphone by a series of other speakers who decried the 
dangers of malathion and the insensitivity of the state. 
</P>
<P>
As they spoke, signs proclaiming, "Stop Poisoning Us!" or "Boycott California 
Fruit!" bobbed lazily above their heads; children milled around the schoolyard 
toting orange-and-black paper Medfly masks. 
</P>
<P>
After the last speaker finished, Torres was presented with his own Medfly mask 
and the assembled reporters and camera crews began to pack up their equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the crowd started to dissipate, Cypher suddenly burst out in a deep, 
booming, theatrical voice, chanting: "Just say no to oranges! Just say no to 
oranges! Just say no to oranges!" 
</P>
<P>
Everyone turned to look. 
</P>
<P>
Then the crowd erupted: "Just say no to oranges!"

MAJOR CONSERVATION EFFORT OUTLINED BY ENERGY DEPT.

In a turnaround from the Ronald Reagan years, the Bush Administration announced 
Friday what it called a major energy conservation initiative that emphasizes 
searching for alternative fuels -- solar power, ethanol and hydropower -- while 
offering symbolic gestures, such as reducing lighting needs in federal 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first major conservation initiative in the Bush Administration and 
maybe in a decade," Deputy Energy Department Secretary W. Henson Moore said of 
the six-year, $336-million program. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which Moore said "goes into effect today" and will be financed this 
year by $30 million shifted from other department programs, met with guarded 
approval by environmental and conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, we're encouraged by what we're hearing. They are saying a lot of the 
right things," said Mark Ledbetter, a senior associate at the American Council 
for an Energy Efficient Economy. 
</P>
<P>
The approach represents a marked reversal from the Reagan Administration, 
during which federal support for conservation and renewal energy sources 
withered. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative includes programs intended to reduce the cost of ethanol 
production, to encourage ways of using concentrated solar energy to break down 
toxic wastes and to search for effective ways to convert more municipal waste 
into energy. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that if the different programs were successful, annual reductions of 
800 million tons in carbon dioxide emissions, a gas contributing to the 
"greenhouse effect," and 2.3 million tons in sulfur dioxide, an acid rain 
pollutant, could be reached. The reductions would be roughly 20% of what is 
called for in the President's Clean Air Act amendments, according to the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also is allocating $19.6 million to construct a laboratory at 
the government's Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colo., to be 
devoted to research in solar-electric and solar-heat technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, the DOE also will attempt to "define the developable 
(hydropower) capacity" at existing dam sites throughout the country. Moore 
acknowledged that environmental concerns have significantly stifled hydropower 
development, which he called "the most proven and developed of all" renewable 
sources of energy. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Moore said, the initiative "could produce cumulative savings 
of up to $32 billion, from an investment of $336 million. That's a return of 
almost 100 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
But Ledbetter questioned the claim of that "phenomenal" return. "It makes me a 
little suspicious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For months, senior DOE officials have been promoting the conservation 
initiative as a major prelude to the development of a long-term "national 
energy strategy." Ordered last July by President Bush, the strategy is intended 
to ensure that the country will have adequate supplies of clean, competitively 
priced energy well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has been holding public hearings 
around the country, often with other senior Cabinet officials presiding as 
co-hosts, in an attempt to forge a national consensus.

TACTICS SWITCH MAY HAVE BOOSTED NAVY'S INVASION TOLL; 
</P>

PANAMA: A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE INCREASED THE EXPOSURE OF COMMANDOS SENT TO 
SABOTAGE NORIEGA'S PLANE. FOUR DIED IN THE ENSUING EXCHANGE WITH THE DICTATOR'S

<P>
Pentagon officials assessing last month's Panama invasion believe that an 
11th-hour change of orders could have contributed to the high casualty toll 
suffered by a group of Navy SEALs in an attack on Punta Paitilla airport, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours before the Panama invasion's "H-hour" on Dec. 20, three commando 
platoons -- about 48 men -- were moving secretly toward the airport to destroy 
Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega's specially equipped airplane to prevent 
him from using it to escape. 
</P>
<P>
But at the last minute, the units of the Navy's sea-air-land commando force 
received new instructions: They were only to disable the plane by wrecking the 
undercarriage so the plane could not take off, an assignment calling for 
near-surgical precision. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, apparently made by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander of the 
Panama-based Southern Command, reflected a desire to minimize damage to the 
populous residential area surrounding the airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But it required the SEALs to get much closer to the aircraft than the plan they 
had rehearsed. It also required them to move more fully into the open, where 
they were exposed to a small but heavily armed Panamanian force in the fierce 
fire-fight that ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Four SEALs were killed in the operation, and three were so badly wounded that 
their return to the Navy's elite commando service is considered improbable. 
</P>
<P>
The SEALs' tactical change apparently was compounded by flawed U.S. 
intelligence that underestimated the type of protective force that the 
Panamanians would have in place at the airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The revised orders and faulty intelligence are prompting some criticism among 
military analysts, who contend that either a larger force should have been used 
or the target should have been subdued first with artillery. 
</P>
<P>
"It did expose them to more risk," said one defense official with a detailed 
knowledge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Had they known earlier about the larger threat and the new assignment, the 
official said, "they would have fought a different battle. They would have 
stood off and softened the place up (with mortar fire). They're not in the John 
Wayne business." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone made a bad decision," another official said. "The SEALs were doing 
something they weren't trained to do. The mission they did is normally a (Army) 
Ranger mission." 
</P>
<P>
The unforeseen restriction on the use of heavy firepower and the unexpected 
ferocity of the small band of trained Noriega forces have caused soul-searching 
on the part of the SEALs' leadership and in the Pentagon office responsible for 
the commandos' training and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake," said one knowledgeable source. "It looks like a few guys 
bought it who didn't have to. It's fair to say that people are taking a look at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon review, he said, is intended to determine if such last-minute 
changes can be avoided in future operations. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the SEALs' task, officials said, was the critical intelligence 
failure. In briefings before the operation, the SEALs were told that the only 
security at Paitilla airport would be untrained and lightly armed civilian 
security police. 
</P>
<P>
Described by one official as "rent-a-cops," the security police were considered 
more likely to run than to stand and fight. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a small band of Gen. Noriega's elite special operations forces awaited 
the SEALs, armed with automatic weapons -- including a Browning automatic 
rifle, according to one on-scene report. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanians, tipped off to the arrival of the invading U.S. forces by waves 
of arriving transport planes, had taken up positions in a spot with a panoramic 
view of the airfield -- and an unobstructed line of fire on the SEALs advancing 
toward Noriega's aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
While no Panamanian leader made a move toward the aircraft, intelligence 
analysts operating offshore warned the SEALs that armored personnel carriers 
filled with Panamanian soldiers were approaching Paitilla, spreading fears that 
the troops at the airport were being reinforced. But officials said that 
contrary to earlier published reports, the armored personnel carriers bypassed 
Paitilla and continued onward to defend Noriega's military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
As a platoon of SEALs advanced on Noriega's aircraft, they saw a Panamanian 
gunman and opened fire. Besides the U.S. casualties, a Panamanian intelligence 
officer who later surrendered to U.S. forces revealed that three Panamanian 
commandos had perished in the attack and eight Panamanians were taken away in 
ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Americans came under such intense fire that they were forced to 
abandon hopes of disabling the airplane with minimal firepower. In the end, the 
SEALs used "all they had," according to one source, destroying Noriega's plane 
and at least two other aircraft, as well as Paitilla's hangar. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded SEALs waited in some cases for hours for medical evacuation, a 
problem that officials attributed partly to communications lapses. 
</P>
<P>
These problems have prompted Navy officials, in "lessons-learned" reports 
submitted to the Pentagon, to stress the SEALs' need for communications 
channels and specially equipped helicopters of their own. The requested 
choppers, a version of the Navy's LAMPS 3 anti-submarine helicopter, are being 
built and delivered to the SEALs as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. casualties made the Paitilla operation one of the bloodiest exchanges 
of the entire Panama invasion, which left 23 Americans and more than 500 
Panamanian soldiers and civilians dead. Officials said the Navy will recommend 
that several of the commandos who participated in the Paitilla attack receive 
awards for their valor. 
</P>
<P>
Several SEALs dashed onto the Tarmac to drag the wounded to safety as Noriega's 
gunmen raked the airfield with fire. 
</P>
<P>
One of those killed, Lt. (j.g.) John P. Connors, was maneuvering with his squad 
to reinforce a group of SEALs under fire, said one knowledgeable source. To 
join the SEALs in Panama, Connors had left a hospital where he was being 
treated for a skin disease contracted while training in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Panama, Navy SEALs successfully sank escape boats and secured 
critical facilities without serious casualties. In those areas, the SEALs 
conducted more traditional missions: Moving in small teams of about 16 men, 
they conducted sabotage missions and other operations, usually with enough 
stealth to avoid engagements with Panamanian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The SEALs' Paitilla mission was a somewhat unconventional assignment for them, 
according to knowledgeable officials. Pentagon sources said that any further 
bolstering of the force would have removed the elite service even further from 
the missions it was intended and trained to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Said one knowledgeable source, "SEALs don't do missions where you have to 
'soften up' the target in advance" with artillery. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a large force for the SEALs," said another defense official. "But if 
they'd gone in with that guidance from the beginning and known what was there, 
they wouldn't have done it this way and maybe taken fewer casualties."

TUGUEGARAO, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonfires of burning tires lit the night sky, and scowling guards armed with 
assault rifles checked everyone who entered Rodolfo Aguinaldo's bunker-like 
concrete command center -- surrounded by a 12-foot-high barbed wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, President Corazon Aquino's latest nightmare was holding court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pain in the everything," Aguinaldo told visitors with a grin. "In 
Manila, they get constipated every time they think of me." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, six weeks after Aguinaldo donned combat fatigues and announced that he 
had sent troops and tanks to Manila to join an attempted coup by mutinous 
soldiers, the boyish-faced governor and political boss of rugged Cagayan 
province tied Aquino's government in knots. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 days, Aquino tried to enforce a government order suspending Aguinaldo 
from office for supporting the coup. For 16 days, Aguinaldo refused, becoming 
an embarrassing public symbol of Aquino's political impotence. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Aguinaldo finally stepped down last Saturday, two days after the 
interview in his command center, his defiance was daily headline news. How 
Aguinaldo resisted tells a lot about how the Philippines works. It tells even 
more, perhaps about why Aquino's government often doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo is one of the Philippines' classic warlords, a former national police 
intelligence commander who became infamous under deposed President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos. Known as a fierce anti-Communist, he trained and led a private "black 
army" of several hundred 4-foot-tall Negrito tribesmen and former Communist 
commandos. 
</P>
<P>
Their tactics were not subtle: Amnesty International accused him repeatedly in 
the mid-1980s of torturing, maiming and murdering his foes. A church group 
accused him of raping the wives, sisters and daughters of his prisoners. Other 
human rights groups called him Marcos' top torturer. 
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo was also one of the early leaders of RAM, the Reform the Armed Forces 
Movement. The "Ramboys" have figured in every one of the six attempted coups 
against Aquino, and Aguinaldo has never kept his sympathies secret. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, for example, while still provincial police commander in 
Cagayan province, he won national notoriety by flying the Philippine flag 
upside down to symbolize his support for an abortive coup by RAM leader Col. 
Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan. Aguinaldo held out for months as head of one of the 
so-called "lost commands" before resigning to run for governor. He won in 
January, 1988, in a landslide. Since then, his critics say, he has used his 
army and political payoffs to run a $50,000-a-day local lottery, as well as a 
lucrative illegal logging and smuggling operation in one of the nation's 
poorest provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo's critics include 17 of the province's 29 mayors. They met Aquino in 
Manila to demand his ouster for treason and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"He is destroying the province," Delfin Ting, mayor of Tuguegarao, the 
provincial capital, said before Aguinaldo ended his defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating his own armed bodyguards, Ting added, "What we are worried about now 
is assassination attempts against mayors." 
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo and his supporters, in turn, accuse the local mayors, congressmen and 
other politicians of drug abuse, illegal gambling, smuggling and more. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fighting to eliminate all graft and corruption in the province," said 
Ferdinand Trinidad, vice mayor of Iguig and one of hundreds of Aguinaldo's 
supporters who gather daily at the governor's compound. "The others are trying 
to protect their interests." 
</P>
<P>
"The governor is a phenomenon," agreed Felito Ramirez, a member of the 
provincial board. "He is adored by the masses and hated by the elite." 
</P>
<P>
But the long-festering local fight over provincial spoils 250 miles north of 
Manila spilled into the national arena after Aguinaldo went on radio and 
telephoned foreign news bureaus, including that of The Times, during the Dec. 
1-9 coup attempt. He said he had sent 5,000 armed troops, plus tanks and 
artillery down to Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The troops, who apparently numbered closer to 50, were turned back at an army 
barricade on a winding mountain road about 100 miles south of here, according 
to military officials. Ever since, Aguinaldo has denied talking to reporters or 
sending the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to prove it in court," he said. "How can they prove it?" 
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo has used the courts to fight Manila, filing motions and getting a 
local judge to restrain Aquino's 60-day suspension order. When the nation's 
Supreme Court overturned the local judge, Aguinaldo said the government needed 
a new court order to break through barricades outside his compound. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated visits and phone calls by Aquino aides, including Defense Secretary 
Fidel V. Ramos, failed to resolve the crisis. Deadlines came and went. Daily 
headlines rubbed salt in Aquino's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making a fool out of the government," complained Ramon V. Mitra, speaker 
of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff produced the kind of theater that passes for politics here. In 
meetings and rallies, Aguinaldo strutted and shouted, saying alternately that 
he would wage "total war," go underground, or submit to the "will of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"The voice of the people is the voice of God," he shouted to his cheering 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Aguinaldo's supporters jammed the local airport last week to block 
a plane bringing his replacement, Vice Gov. Melvin Vargas. Hundreds more 
barricaded themselves into Aguinaldo's compound. The more fervent fans said 
they were willing to die to keep him in office. 
</P>
<P>
But 100 riot police from Manila and a single tear-gas shell sent the supporters 
scampering last Saturday. Vargas took the oath as acting governor and 
immediately denied allegations of corruption. And Aguinaldo retreated to his 
bunker while his lawyers went back to court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just using the law to defend myself," he said Monday by phone. "Plus, I'm 
waiting for them to drag me away."

Vice President Dumitru Mazilu resigned Friday to protest what he called 
"Stalinist practices and methods" in the interim government of the National 
Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
Mazilu handed in his resignation just hours after President Ion Iliescu 
rejected calls for the resignation of his government and criticized attempts to 
undermine his authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Having seen with great sorrow and deep regret that Stalinist practices and 
methods persist, that labels continue to be attached on the strength of 
security files and accusations made by pounding the table, that the press is 
still directed to destroy some people and promote some others, I resign the 
office I said I did not want on the very first day," Mazilu said in a 
nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to files kept by the Securitate, the hated secret 
police of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Mazilu, an expert in international law who worked at the United Nations, was 
arrested by the Ceausescu regime in 1988 after writing a report on human rights 
violations in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech, carried Friday by Rompres, the official Romanian news agency, 
Iliescu defended the front as the country's only political hope for the 
immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
"For all its weaknesses and shortcomings, the National Salvation Front is the 
only structure, very frail still, that bears the brunt," Iliescu said "The 
collapse of this structure means pushing the country to chaos." 
</P>
<P>
He urged opposition parties to "forget about political passions and electoral 
ambitions" in the interests of national stability. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu also defended the front's decision this week to put up candidates in 
national elections scheduled for May 20, saying no other group on the horizon 
has the know-how and experience needed to run the government. 
</P>
<P>
His speech followed a barrage of attacks against the ruling National Salvation 
Front from fledgling opposition groups hoping to take its place at the head of 
the government after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been protesting on a daily basis outside the National 
Salvation Front's headquarters to demand that the front reverse its decision to 
run in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The front has responded by banning protests in virtually all public places 
except parks. 
</P>
<P>
However, more than 500 people Friday night defied the ban, demonstrating again 
at the front's headquarters as soldiers backed by tanks looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu also denounced what he termed a "tendency to separatism," a reference 
to resurgent nationalism among some of Romania's ethnic minorities.

Despite the attacks on Armenians living in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, 
thousands of them are still there although they seldom venture out of doors for 
fear of being spotted by gangs roaming the streets, an Armenian official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them, according to Armenians who have fled the violence as refugees, 
are living on hope -- hope that eventually the situation will improve. 
</P>
<P>
Some have a deep emotional attachment to the hillside city overlooking the 
Caspian Sea, even though scores of Armenians have been killed or beaten and 
robbed there in the last two weeks. They are described as reluctant to leave 
their friends and homes as long as they think there is a chance that things 
will get better. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Donyetsk, 24, who had arrived in Moscow from Baku less than a day earlier, 
told a reporter Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"I finally asked myself how much longer could I live like this? Two days? Three 
days? No, it would take much longer. There is no end in sight. Besides, I heard 
there was a group of Azerbaijanis after me. It was time to go. But I left 
behind several friends who are not yet ready to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Baku has been under Soviet army control for a week, since tanks and troops 
burst through barricades that the Azerbaijanis had thrown up around the city. 
Before that, starting on Jan. 13, Azerbaijani militants had carried out a 
series of attacks against Armenians, killing at least 72, according to official 
figures, and beating and robbing countless others. 
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku this month, leaving about 
15,000 others behind in the city of 1.8 million people, according to Eduard 
Aikazyan, chief of the Armenian mission, which represents the republic's 
interests in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Armenians who remain are being threatened, and some are being beaten and 
robbed even now," Aikazyan said in an interview at the mission, which is 
crowded with several hundred refugees. "The presence of the Soviet troops seems 
to have put an end to organized pogroms, but spontaneous attacks are 
continuing." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists have not been allowed into the Azerbaijani republic since 
the trouble started, preventing independent confirmation of the charges made on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Contact with the remaining Armenians in Baku is difficult, for most have gone 
underground. Aikazyan said many of them have had no opportunity to buy train or 
airplane tickets. The boats that for a time carried refugees from Baku to the 
Soviet Turkmen republic, across the Caspian Sea, apparently are no longer 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
"During the day, it is a dead city," refugee Donyetsk said. "There are no 
buses, no mail, no newspapers, no factories operating. At night there is 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Other refugees said Soviet troops have dropped leaflets urging calm. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Armenians still there stay indoors all the time because they are 
afraid," said Leila Stepanova, 45, who was making sandwiches for a niece and a 
nephew in a corner of a second-floor room at the mission. "We waited to leave 
because we kept hoping for better, but now some of the Azerbaijanis who have 
helped Armenians hide are being threatened themselves. So, I packed two pairs 
of shoes and two dresses, and we left." 
</P>
<P>
Furusa Kostandova, 37, whose 18-month-old son was sleeping with his head in her 
lap, said she, too, had waited to leave because she hoped things would get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," she went on, "everything we own is in Baku. But the outrages 
continued, even with the army there. We had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was still looking for two of her children, one 9 and the other 10, 
who were evacuated several days before she left. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees confirmed reports by Azerbaijanis that the people attacking 
Armenians are, for the most part, bitter Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia. 
These people, reportedly fearing retribution after an earlier outbreak of 
violence between the two ethnic groups, fled to Baku in February, 1988, and 
have lived since then in poverty, many of them without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Sadina Shahbayana, 17, who left Baku on Thursday night dressed in her best 
clothes and jewelry, said: "There are many good Azerbaijanis. I have many 
Azerbaijani friends, and it was very hard to go." 
</P>
<P>
She said groups of 30 to 40 Azerbaijanis were wandering through the city 
attacking Armenians. Her family felt immune from the violence for some time, 
she said, because although her mother is Armenian, her father is Azerbaijani. 
</P>
<P>
"But then we got a threatening telephone call," she said. "They said they knew 
my mother was Armenian, so my parents said we had to leave. I'm afraid right 
now, but I definitely want to go back some day. It's my home, my motherland."

FIGHT DRUGS WITH VOLUNTEERS, BUSH TELLS MAYORS

President Bush told the nation's mayors Friday they should rely more on 
volunteer efforts to fight illegal drugs in their cities and pledged to use the 
White House as "a bully pulpit" to activate citizens in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing on the value of voluntary action, the mayors responded that it 
is no substitute for government money and renewed their criticism of the 
Administration's newly released drug war blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
Bush earned some good will from the mayors by becoming the first President in a 
decade to address the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting, but his drug plan has 
drawn mostly negative reviews from the men and women who run the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Citing surveys showing Americans' willingness to contribute time or money to 
combat drugs in their neighborhoods, Bush said: "They want to serve. They want 
to give. But they have to be asked before they can do either. I promise, I will 
use the bully pulpit to ask them to do both, and I urge you to do the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Bush's emphasis on his "1,000 points of light" approach, Houston 
Mayor Kathy Whitmire, a Democrat, said: "I happen to be an advocate of 
voluntarism. I feel it is a successful approach. It is not, however, a 
replacement for government." 
</P>
<P>
The mayors criticized Bush's latest drug strategy, which calls for $10.6 
billion in spending, as inadequate given the problem they are confronting at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush also emphasized tougher law enforcement and asked the 
mayors to support his plan to expand the death penalty for certain drug-related 
crimes. The mayors, taking no position on capital punishment, said they want 
substantially more money for law enforcement and want the money funneled 
directly to the cities, claiming cities received only 15% of the federal 
enforcement funds last year. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, a Democrat, praised the President for appearing 
but said the mayors have a "sharp disagreement" with the Administration on its 
approach to cities, not only in the drug fight but also in providing adequate 
housing for the poor and the homeless.

INJURED SMUGGLER BETRAYED BY TELL-TALE X-RAY 
</P>

<P>
The stocky Colombian man of about 30 did not look much different from the other 
air crash victims at North Shore University Hospital as Dr. Robert J. Ward 
prepared to operate on him early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Like other passengers of Avianca Flight 52, the man had suffered severe 
internal bleeding and numerous broken bones. But as the surgeon prepared to 
treat the intestinal wounds, he discovered round shadows shaped like 
suppositories on X-rays of the man's digestive system. 
</P>
<P>
Before operating, Ward asked the still conscious man about the contents of the 
what seemed to be small packages. The man confirmed what Ward already suspected 
-- the packages were actually neatly tied latex condoms that contained cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed that his intestines were filled with golf-ball sized packages, from 
his large intestine to his rectum." Ward said. "We asked him what it was 
because it could possibly contaminate his system. He told us it was cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Ward would pull four condoms from the unidentified man's rectum. As 
of late Friday, about 10 more condoms remained inside the man's intestines. In 
all, Ward estimated that the man carried more than a pound of the white powdery 
substance in his digestive tract. 
</P>
<P>
(According to the Los Angeles Police Department, a pound of cocaine would have 
a street value of about $170,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Ward said that the remaining condoms were not removed to "let nature pass its 
course." Because of the effects of the operation, the condoms may not pass 
through his digestive tract for weeks, Ward said. If one of the packets leaks 
or bursts during that period the patient would be in serious danger of dying 
from cocaine poisoning. However, it was considered too dangerous to remove the 
packets now. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the air crash victim likely ingested the cocaine-filled 
condoms before boarding the Avianca flight in Colombia. "They were fairly 
professionally packaged," Ward said, adding that the man probably used enemas 
to clean out his colon before swallowing the condoms. 
</P>
<P>
The man was out of surgery late Friday afternoon and was expected to live, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The four packages were handed over to Nassau County police, hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration officials confirmed that the white substance 
found in the condoms was cocaine. They also said that earlier reports claiming 
two other passengers who died in the crash were also smuggling cocaine were 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper said drug smugglers often try to conceal up to a 
pound of cocaine in condoms, by swallowing and then excreting it, or concealing 
it in body orifices. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been instances where we have arrested people and then waited at a 
hospital for them to excrete (the bags)," Cooper said.

<P>
Peering through the chill and rainy darkness, Carlos Montero was stunned at 
what he saw. The tail of a jetliner jutted like a rising moon amid the thicket 
of trees at the end of the secluded little road where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
His first impulse was to keep his distance for fear of an explosion or fire, 
Montero recalled Friday, but when he heard voices calling for help, his 
training as an orthopedic surgeon took over. 
</P>
<P>
Montero tried to get to the most badly hurt first. For splints, he used 
anything he could find, including tree branches and pieces of fiberglass from 
the door of the Avianca Boeing 707. "It was triage, because there were so many 
people, and in the beginning, there was not much help," Montero said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like this had ever happened in this hamlet of 400 people, which 
includes what was once President Theodore Roosevelt's famous Sagamore Hill 
estate. Tranquility is what draws the privileged to these houses on Oyster Bay 
Harbor, set several acres apart and selling for a half-million dollars and up. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, however, tragedy intruded, when Flight 52 slammed into a 
hillside at the end of Tennis Court Road. Slogging through mud with 
flashlights, neighbors labored side by side with police and firefighters to 
pull survivors from the wreckage, some from under the bodies of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the plane, Jorge Lozano, a 59-year-old Bogota executive headed to New 
York on business, unbuckled the belt that had held him in seat 4F and slid as 
far as he could through a hole in the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait Seems Endless 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour wait for help seemed endless, as people around him screamed and 
groaned. One teen-ager kept begging: "Please help my mother, because she's 
trapped under her seat," Lozano recalled Friday in an interview from his 
stretcher in the North Shore University Hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the injured to the 14 area hospitals that awaited them was difficult, 
because the only way out was a narrow road, which quickly jammed with rescue 
vehicles and hundreds of curious people skirting police barriers to see a 
disaster first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't people just stay home and let an emergency be an emergency?" one 
neighbor complained. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was such that Glen Cove Community Hospital, one of the closest to the 
scene, did not get its first patient until two hours after the crash, hospital 
spokesman Steven Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, nurses and doctors did what they could at the scene, attaching 
IV lines and administering painkillers in several makeshift field hospitals, 
including one on the front yard of the white stucco mansion of John McEnroe 
Sr., the father of the tennis star. In another section of the McEnroe yard, 
yellow body bags were laid out in neat rows. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to arrive was Oyster Bay Fire Chief Tom Reardon, who said he 
quickly began "ordering everything we had in the world here." By his estimate, 
at least 160 rescuers showed up from area communities, including New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"We found two babies in the ravine. They were thrown from the plane," Reardon 
said. Both were alive. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Montero and several of his neighbors said they found it curious 
that they heard no roar of engines, only the sudden boom of the plane hitting 
the wooded hillside. The 707 sheared about a dozen treetops and lay in three 
pieces within 20 feet of one house. The house was undamaged, except for its 
deck, which was ripped off by the nose of the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
The house's occupants, uninjured, were not available for comment. Next door, 
Tom McCarthy said he had been watching television when he heard a boom that his 
wife thought was a loud clap of thunder, but that he suspected to be the crash 
of a small plane. The darkness was so thick that he could not see the huge 707 
that had plowed into the ground only a few hundred feet from his front door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grim Routine Begins 
</P>
<P>
With a cold rain drenching them Friday afternoon, crews of police, utility 
repairmen and firefighters settled into the grim routine of cleaning up. They 
piled luggage, strollers, handbags and other personal belongings onto trucks. 
National Transportation Safety Board inspectors showed up to begin trying to 
figure out what happened. 
</P>
<P>
But for some families, daylight did not bring an end to the nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Riding a shuttle bus with others in his situation, 45-year-old Pedro Betancourt 
was at his fourth hospital in his search for his wife, Gloria, who had been 
visiting relatives in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
He clutched at every fading hope. "Maybe she got her papers mixed up, maybe 
they have her under a different name," he said. "They say there's three people 
they haven't identified yet who are still alive." 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday afternoon, he was among the 300 men and women waiting patiently 
and sadly at the end of the line -- the morgue at Nassau County Medical Center, 
where they would get a chance to see if they could find their loved ones among 
the unidentified bodies. 
</P>
<P>
For others, such as 11-year-old Michael Gomez of Stamford, Conn., there was 
jubilation. It had taken a search of five hospitals to account for his parents, 
two younger sisters and brother. The entire family survived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle," said Jaime Cano, 22, who had been baby sitting Michael Gomez 
while his family was in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds forge quickly in an ordeal, and some passengers, while grateful for their 
own survival, were anxious to hear how others had fared. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, the Colombian businessman, was having difficulty speaking, his tongue 
swollen and bruised. Still, he wanted to know from a reporter: "Do you know if 
Nestor Zamora survived? I met him at the airport in Bogota. He's a friend of 
mine." 
</P>

The Boeing 707 that crashed here Thursday night was a 23-year-old plane with 
far fewer flight hours than other jets of its vintage. 
</P>
<P>
The Avianca plane was the 592nd model to come off the 707 assembly line at 
Boeing. It was delivered to Pan American World Airways on June 30, 1967, and 
sold to Avianca on Feb. 25, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The doomed plane had flown 61,193 flight hours and landed 22,764 times. Most 
707s of that vintage have averaged 80,000 flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said Friday that it did not know if the plane had recent problems. The 
National Transportation Safety Board is expected to investigate that question, 
and Boeing sent a safety investigator, a pilot and a fuel systems expert to 
help the NTSB in its overall probe. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the plane had been plagued by 
mechanical problems recently, having been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times 
in the past four months. The radio did not say what the maintenance was for.

<P>
Known as a reliable and durable workhorse, the 707 is nevertheless no longer 
flying passengers in this country with two notable exceptions: Air Force One, 
the President's plane, and its backup are 707s. 
</P>
<P>
The 707 fell into disuse in the United States largely because of noise 
restrictions and the introduction of more fuel efficient and wider-bodied 
aircraft. Many 707s still fly elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real solidly built airplane," said Jack B. Feir, a New York aviation 
consultant who specializes in aircraft appraisals. "It's a tank." 
</P>
<P>
The 707 was Boeing's first commercial jetliner. The last commercial version of 
the plane was built in 1978 but the company is still making military versions 
of it.

Avianca, the national airline of Colombia, which flies to Miami, New York and 
once a week to Los Angeles, is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere. 
Nevertheless, some of its pilots have acquired the reputation of not always 
being as conservative as their counterparts in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"They are cowboys," said one source in the aviation industry who declined to be 
identified. "They will fly in mountains in bad weather. They do things more 
conservative American pilots wouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
An Avianca Boeing 747 crashed on approach to Madrid, Spain, in November of 
1983, killing 181. Eleven survived. 
</P>
<P>
In November of 1989 an Avianca 727 crashed near Bogota, killing all 107 aboard. 
Investigators confirmed that a bomb in the passenger cabin consisting of 
plastic explosive was the cause. A telephone caller claimed that a group of 
drug lords called "the Extraditables" planted the bomb in order to kill five 
police informants it said were on board.

The French government condemned the state of siege and media censorship imposed 
by military ruler Prosper Avril and suspended economic aid to Haiti until the 
crackdown is lifted. Lt. Gen. Avril had been expected to lift the state of 
siege Friday but did not appear on national television for a scheduled 10 a.m. 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
There was no explanation for the delay. The French Embassy in the capital 
announced the decision on aid, which was made in Paris by the Foreign Ministry. 
Last year, France provided about $23 million in assistance to Haiti, and this 
year's allotment had been expected to be about $35 million.

IRANIAN GUARDS KILL 4 HIJACKERS IN SHOOT-OUT

Four men armed with grenades and handguns tried to hijack an Iranian airliner 
during a domestic flight, but security guards killed them in a midair 
shoot-out, Iranian news reports said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia, said the gunmen tried to 
seize Flight 133 on Thursday night after it took off from the city of Shiraz in 
southwest Iran en route to the port city of Bandar Abbas on the Strait of 
Hormuz. 
</P>
<P>
"By the alertness and swift action of flight security guards of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard, the four hijackers were killed and the plane landed safely 
with all the passengers unhurt," the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard told Tehran Radio that the hijackers 
took a flight attendant hostage before the guards moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Alireza Afshar, who said that the hijackers had demanded to go to 
Israel or Iraq, conceded that check-in procedures had been relaxed recently and 
that the hijackers apparently took advantage of this and were able to smuggle 
weapons aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
A Revolutionary Guard statement quoted earlier by the radio described the 
hijackers of the Boeing 727 as "mercenaries of America," a catch-all phrase for 
opposition groups fighting to overthrow the Islamic government. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen were not further identified. However, a reference in the statement 
that said the gunmen misused "responsibilities to search passengers" implied 
they may have been dissident members of the Revolutionary Guard employed in 
flight security. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Guard, an elite paramilitary force, set up a special unit of 
sky marshals in 1984 after several Iranian passenger planes were hijacked and 
flown out of the country by dissident groups. 
</P>
<P>
This special unit has since foiled 16 hijack attempts on Iran Air domestic 
flights, including Thursday's, the news reports said.

"Scared to death" of the costs of nursing home care, most older Americans are 
willing to pay $50 a month for a government insurance program covering 
long-term care, according to a study for the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
The report should help policy makers trying to craft a solution to the 
long-term care problem, said Horace Deets of the AARP. The fledgling market for 
private long-term care insurance has grown in recent years, with about 1.3 
million policies sold by mid-1989.

Bernice Tongate, considered the Navy's first pin-up girl when she became the 
model in a popular World War I Navy recruiting poster, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tongate, who was 92 when she died Jan. 16, said she decided to join the 
Navy in 1917 after reading about women enlisting in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Well-known poster artist Howard Chandler Christy happened to be in the Los 
Angeles recruiting office that day. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men loaned the new recruit a Navy cap, jumper and neckerchief, and 
Christy's drawing of her was soon posted around the country with the words: 
"Gee, I wish I were a man. I'd join the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tongate was a chief yeoman when she was discharged in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
When the Navy said she was too old to re-enlist during World War II, she joined 
the Army instead. 
</P>
<P>
She had two grandsons who served in Vietnam.

G. BUEHRIG; TOP DESIGNER OF MOTORCARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon M. Buehrig, one of the country's leading automotive designers because of 
such masterworks as his Duesenberg Model J, the coffin-nosed Cord 810 and 812 
of the 1930s and the Auburn Boattail Speedster, died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, Barbara Orlando, said that her father died at home in Grosse 
Pointe, Mich., where he had returned after living in Southern California. He 
had taught at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a banker in Mason City, Ill., Buehrig dropped out of Bradley 
University in Peoria to work as a body shop apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
By 1928, he was designing bodies for Stutz Motor Car Co. in Indianapolis, and 
the following year, at age 25, he became chief body designer for Duesenberg 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
There he designed the "Twenty Grand," a unique car that sold originally for 
$20,000 and now is worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, he went to work for E. L. Cord, who built both the Cord and Auburn 
automobiles in Auburn, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
His design of the Cord 810 was the talk of the 1935 New York Auto Show. Not 
only was it one of the earliest front-wheel drive cars, but, at 12 inches lower 
than most cars of the era, it permitted drivers to step into rather than climb 
up to the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
About that same time, he also devised the "T-top" roof so popular today and the 
flip-up headlights now in use on many modern cars. 
</P>
<P>
After working as a free-lance designer through much of the 1940s, Buehrig 
joined Ford, where he designed the 1951 Victoria and the 1952 Ford station 
wagon. He also helped design the prestigious 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II 
before retiring from Ford in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring, he moved to Laguna Hills and taught at the Art Center from 1965 
to 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, the Museum of Modern Art selected the Cord as one of the outstanding 
automotive designs of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame, and in 1981 the 
Society of Automotive Historians put Buehrig in its list of the top 30 people 
who influenced automotive history. The late Harley Earl of General Motors was 
the only other designer in that limited group. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his daughter, Buehrig is survived by his wife, Kathryn, two 
stepdaughters and eight grandchildren.

OFFICERS FREED ON BAIL IN ROB, KIDNAP CASE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DISCLOSURES: TWO SAN DIEGO POLICEMEN WERE ARRESTED FIVE MONTHS AGO IN THE 
INCIDENTS INVOLVING ILLEGAL ALIENS BUT WERE NEVER CHARGED. THEY RETURNED TO 
WORK AFTER THEY WERE SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego policemen charged with kidnaping and robbing illegal aliens were 
released Friday night on $35,000 bail each, after a judge was told that the 
officers were originally arrested five months ago in the case but never 
charged, and suspended for 30 days without pay and then reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf have pleaded not guilty to 
five felony counts each of kidnaping and robbing three Latino undocumented 
workers in two incidents downtown last August. If convicted, they could be 
sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Although no assault charges were filed, court records contend that Hoff struck 
one of the Latinos in the testicles with his police flashlight and pushed him 
into a puddle of water. The officers also stole a total of $166 from the three 
men, according to the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
When the pair were arrested Thursday morning, police officials announced that 
they also were being fired, after serving as patrol officers for about four 
years each in the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a bail review hearing Friday morning before Municipal Judge Timothy W. 
Tower, their defense attorneys revealed that the officers were arrested and 
disciplined when the allegations were first raised in August. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys James Gattey and Everett Bobbitt said the officers expected the 
allegations to amount to nothing because they were not charged with a crime in 
August, and because their 30-day suspensions were overturned and they were 
reinstated with the back pay. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspensions were for 30 days, and then they were reinstated and went back 
to work," said Gattey, who represents 27-year-old Hoff. "They have been at work 
every day since." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, who represents Schaaf, 29, said the officers believed the allegations 
against them never had been substantiated until the San Diego County district 
attorney's office recently took a renewed interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We got rumblings in the last couple of weeks that something was cooking," 
Bobbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney pointed out that the facts in the case had not changed since 
August. "Everything they have now was available then," he said of the district 
attorney's office. "It's all in the reports. And they reinstated them. What 
changed now? Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Pent, a deputy prosecutor in the district attorney's special 
operations unit, declined to discuss specifics about how the case evolved. But 
he did tell the judge that the delay in bringing the charges was caused by 
problems regarding the "stability" of the victims, all of them Latinos who 
entered this country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole lot at stake here," he said. "We have undocumented, illegal 
aliens that we are having to take special precautions and measures for to 
ensure their presence in this case." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pent is asking that the case be hurried through the criminal justice 
system, another indication that he is concerned about whether his chief 
witnesses -- the three victims -- will be around for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gattey and Bobbitt attacked the credibility of the three victims, identified as 
Rolando Carrera-Reyes, 23, Javier Perez-Gonzalez and Ramiro Rodriguez, both 21. 
They said one of the victims is now serving time in the El Cajon jail for 
burglarizing a car, and another has disappeared since registering a complaint 
with police in August. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the defense attorneys said their clients are longtime members of 
the San Diego community, that they are homeowners and have wives and children, 
and would not be a flight risk if released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Several of their family friends, along with a representative of the Police 
Officers Assn., which is paying for their legal defense, and a police officer 
who lives near Hoff, attended the hearing, but did not address the court. 
</P>
<P>
Gattey and Bobbitt asked that the judge release the officers on their personal 
recognizance, but Pent suggested a bail of $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, noting the seriousness of the kidnaping charges, settled on a bail 
of $35,000 each.

MUSLIM KILLED BY DEPUTIES SHOT IN HEAD, AUTOPSY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An autopsy conducted Friday confirmed that a man shot by sheriff's deputies in 
a confrontation with Nation of Islam members died of a gunshot wound to the 
head, and also sustained a "graze wound to the right hip," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has previously said that Oliver Beasley, 27, was hit 
by a single round in the head during the confrontation in the Athens District 
south of Los Angeles . 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman, who is heading up an internal investigation into 
Tuesday's fatal shooting, said his initial statements about the nature of 
Beasley's wounds were based on "a preliminary visual examination" at the scene 
"pending a coroner's autopsy." 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, senior investigator for the county coroner's office, declined 
to elaborate on Beasley's autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation that led to Beasley's death erupted shortly after two 
deputies -- a trainee and a training officer -- stopped a vehicle on a minor 
traffic violation early Tuesday morning near an apartment building managed by 
Nation of Islam members. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies say they were attacked by several men from the apartment building 
who grabbed them from behind and placed them in chokeholds. When a handgun was 
allegedly taken from the trainee, he drew a backup weapon and fired five shots. 
David Hartley, 18, a Nation member and the driver of the vehicle that was 
stopped, was wounded in the shoulder and Beasley was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, the training officer's weapon discharged once, during a 
separate struggle for control of that weapon, sheriff's officials have said. 
Until the autopsy was conducted Friday, sheriff's investigators believed that 
the round had not hit anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Merriman said, "We believe . . . the graze wound was caused by the 
training officer's weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a man who said he interviewed witnesses told a group of 
community activists that the trainee shot Beasley in the head, then fired 
another round into the already wounded man. The man also said that Beasley's 
body, held by the heels, was then dragged "up and down the street." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials have described that account as "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials would not release information that would show whether 
Beasley had been dragged. However, Merriman said, "I don't have the complete 
results of the autopsy, but there was absolutely no evidence that he was 
dragged up and down the street -- on his clothes or on his person." 
</P>
<P>
County prosecutors on Thursday filed felony charges against Hartley, but 
declined to charge five other males arrested in the incident because of 
insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley was charged with one count of removing a firearm from a police officer, 
one count of battery against an officer and one count of resisting an officer 
with threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service for Beasley is scheduled for 10 a.m. today at First AME 
Church, 2270 S. Harvard Blvd., Los Angeles.

ABORTION PROTEST JURIES TOLD TO IGNORE NULLIFICATION AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Judges in three trespassing trials involving anti-abortion demonstrators 
admonished jurors Friday to disregard a "jury nullification" advertisement that 
appeared in this week's San Diego Reader. 
</P>
<P>
Steven J. Casey, spokesman for the district attorney, said Municipal Judge 
Larrie R. Brainard, presiding over one such trial in El Cajon, told the jury, 
"in strong words, to pay no attention to the ad, to ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
The ad failed to sway the jury in one trial, in which a guilty verdict was 
returned Friday. Seven defendants being tried in the courtroom of Judge Victor 
Bianchini were convicted of resisting arrest and trespassing, and three others 
were convicted of trespassing. Sentencing may come next week. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Eddie Sturgeon, who presides over the El Cajon Municipal Court, said 
Friday that he is "deeply concerned" about the ad, which was arranged for by 
the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and appeared in Thursday's issue of 
the weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"I have real problems with it," he said. "Basically, it tells potential jurors 
to disregard the law in the state of California. It tells jurors not to follow 
the instructions of the law, to hide their true feelings and intentions from 
the judge. It tells jurors to disregard the oath that they take." 
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern about the ad is that it solicits and encourages prospective 
jurors in a criminal proceeding to just flat-out lie," said Casey, the district 
attorney's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In Casey's words, the ad schools potential jurors on how legally to acquit 
anti-abortion protesters accused of trespassing. Casey said the district 
attorney had warned the court about the ad but may follow up by investigating 
the Reader and Publisher Jim Holman in pursuit of "possible criminal 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
Holman was arrested at a demonstration in Hillcrest last spring and again last 
fall in an anti-abortion blockade of a La Mesa clinic. He is one of 32 
Operation Rescue protesters who came before the court this week in three 
separate trials in El Cajon. His case has not yet been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We run almost any ad of a political nature, unless it's libelous," Holman 
said. "We don't run ads pertaining to abortion clinics or abortion referrals 
because of my personal convictions. But, if Planned Parenthood or the Womancare 
Clinic wanted to run a political ad, we would let them. We might even run a 
political ad from the Communists or the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of this ad, it does seem to me that jurors ought to know all of 
their rights, including jury nullification, whether they choose to exercise 
them or not. Otherwise, we're treating them like infants." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Steve Miller said Friday that his office "may consider" 
banning the Reader from public buildings in San Diego, particularly 
courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Thursday morning, they put piles of these papers in all sorts of public 
buildings," Miller said. "To have hundreds of these papers dumped in the laps 
of prospective jurors worries us. I don't think the existence of the ad is 
going to affect the outcomes of cases all that much -- I think jurors have more 
sense than that -- but why should we take a chance? What distresses us is that 
they (the management of the Reader) pulled this stunt at all. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The people' have to prove a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt, so the 
burden of proof is entirely on us. We consider it a blatant violation of 
ethics, and that's why it's so disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he questions the use of one passage in the ad, which reads: "The 
most important rule is, don't let the judge and prosecutor know that you know 
about this right. It is unjust and illegal for them to deny you this right. So, 
if you have to, it's perfectly all right for you to make a 'mental 
reservation.' 
</P>
<P>
"Give them the same answer you would have given if you were hiding fugitive 
slaves in 1850 and the 'slave catchers' asked if you had runaways in your 
attic. Or if you were hiding Jews from the Nazis in Germany. The second rule 
is, educate the other jurors about jury nullification and, if possible, 
persuade them to vote 'not guilty.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller called the history of jury nullification an ignoble one. He said the 
only time he knew of its having been used was in the South, at a time when Ku 
Klux Klan members were on trial for having murdered blacks, who, in Miller's 
words, "were trying to exercise their rights, by registering to vote." 
</P>
<P>
"The jury decided, in essence, that Klan members could do whatever they 
wanted," Miller said. "Law isn't a case of 'who wins is who we like.' Jury 
nullification is asking jurors to ignore evidence, to ignore law. As a juror, 
you look at the law, and the facts, and to do otherwise is to ignore your sense 
of duty and promise as a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Holman reacted to the possibility of the Reader being banned from courthouses 
in San Diego by saying, "That's so typical. They'll do anything to stop the 
dissemination of information. They don't worry about First Amendment rights, 
and that's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Holman, who is Catholic, said he is opposed to abortion, "not because I'm such 
a religious person, but because it's the deliberate taking of innocent, human 
life." 
</P>
<P>
A local attorney who has represented dozens of anti-abortion activists but who 
begged not to be quoted by name, said he thought the Reader ad was "highly 
questionable and walked a very thin line. Yes, you could say I was opposed to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But Sylvia Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said the Reader ad was 
necessary because of the "irrationality" of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
"This was necessary because the truth is not being allowed in court," Sullivan 
said. "And the truth is, a lot of reasonable people are trying to save babies 
from dying. But, in America, you can't say that in court. Most of our people do 
not deny that they were present at the abortion mill, they just can't say that 
they were trying to save a baby's life." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said a "type of jury nullification" was evident in the recent Ginger 
Brown kidnaping case. 
</P>
<P>
"Her parents did haul her off and tried to have her deprogrammed, but the jury 
acquitted them because they were rescuing her," Sullivan said. "In that case, 
the jury did the moral thing, and everyone seemed to condone it. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do more of this in the future," Sullivan said, in reference to the 
Reader ad. "When the system denies us a defense, we'll do anything to get at 
the truth."

REP. HAWKINS SAYS HE WON'T RUN AGAIN; WATERS TO SEEK SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE 82-YEAR-OLD SENIOR BLACK MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WILL RETIRE AT THE 
END OF THIS SESSION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), the senior black member of the House 
and the first black ever sent to Congress from a Western state, announced 
Friday that he will retire at the end of this session. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, 82, who was elected to Congress in 1962, has been chairman of the 
House Education and Labor Committee for nearly five years and placed his stamp 
on such landmark legislation as the fair employment practice provisions of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act and a series of major education measures. 
</P>
<P>
In his typically quiet, self-effacing way, Hawkins made the announcement in a 
press release issued late Friday afternoon and was not available for 
questioning about his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It is after a great deal of soul-searching that I announce today that I shall 
retire from the Congress," he said. "I intend to continue my public service but 
in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"While I believe I have accomplished much over the years, there is still a full 
agenda of issues that must be addressed," the congressman added. "Equity and 
excellence in education, basic skills training, proper health and nutrition, 
full employment, adequate housing, civil rights and drug abuse remain 
monumental challenges in my community and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins' decision not to seek reelection set off a flurry of activity in Los 
Angeles' black political community, which for years has been frustrated over a 
lack of upward mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), among the most prominent black 
politicians in the country, announced late Friday that she would seek the seat. 
In political circles, she has long been considered Hawkins' heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to do it," said Waters, whom Hawkins had called early 
Friday to privately inform of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
While others are almost certain to enter the race, Waters was already being 
considered the front-runner Friday, given her popularity and the fund-raising 
abilities previously demonstrated by her and her ally, Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco). The district, which covers Watts, South Gate and part 
of Downey, is more than 80% Democratic and mostly black, with a growing Latino 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she expected competition, Waters declared: "You never know. There are 
no obvious ones." 
</P>
<P>
Waters' decision to run for the congressional seat will also loosen the 
political logjam at the state level, and her seat is expected to draw the 
attention of younger political leaders who have been waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference in Los Angeles, hinted broadly Friday that other veteran black 
politicians should follow Hawkins' lead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps the beginning of what I expect to be rather significant change 
in the political leadership of the African-American community over the next 
three to five years," he said. "Some of the other change may not be voluntary. 
. . . It might be useful to others to take note." 
</P>
<P>
Waters, in a brief interview, said she had not determined whether she would 
endorse a successor to the seat she has held since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
During almost three decades in Congress, Hawkins remained extremely popular 
within his district. A former real estate salesman who was elected as the first 
black member of the California Assembly at the start of the New Deal in 1934, 
Hawkins served in the state Legislature until his 1962 election to Congress 
from a newly created black-majority district. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly frustrated by the cutbacks in education and social programs during 
President Ronald Reagan's two terms, Hawkins saw the influence of his Education 
and Labor Committee wane in the late 1980s. When President Bush took office, 
however, Hawkins helped enact a pared-down increase in the federal minimum wage 
to $4.25 an hour. Though the Los Angeles lawmaker felt that was far too little, 
it was the first increase in the minimum wage since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who was so light-skinned that he was frequently thought to be white, 
always took a dispassionate approach to racial matters that sometimes irritated 
militants of both races. 
</P>
<P>
"Racializing an issue defeats my purpose -- which is to get people on my side," 
Hawkins once said. 
</P>
<P>
His name is attached to the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, a measure originally 
intended to guarantee full employment by 1983, with government as the employer 
of last resort. The bill was watered down considerably during the legislative 
process, however, and the federal jobs provision was eliminated and 
unemployment targets were offset by other goals for cutting inflation and the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last fall, Hawkins seemed melancholy about the strides made by 
blacks in America, despite the inclusion of blacks in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of activity but I don't think the activity has been 
focused; I don't think it's paid off," he said. "The fact is that the housing 
situation is worse. Certainly, the schools in the low-income areas in 
particular are worse. . . . The slum conditions have, I think, accelerated if 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Hawkins was not embittered or resentful, even about his inability to rise 
higher on the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a sense trying to do the best I could," he said last fall. "Politics 
is not my chosen field." 
</P>
<P>
However unassuming Hawkins is, his decision Friday to retire unleashed 
accolades from across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Gus Hawkins is synonymous with the poor, the unemployed, the unskilled and 
untrained black person or minority of any ethnic background in this country," 
said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League. "He 
was not the charismatic kind of speechmaker that some others may have been but 
he was a doer. He got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley-Thomas saluted Hawkins as a "stalwart" liberal who had maintained his 
integrity through 56 years of public life. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Hawkins said he wanted to encourage those who followed in his 
footsteps with his personal view of public service, as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership belongs not to the loudest, not to those who beat the drums or 
blow the trumpets, but to those who day in and day out, in all seasons, work 
for the practical realization of a better world -- those who have the stamina 
to persist and to remain dedicated. To those belong the leadership." 
</P>

A car thief sneaked into the showroom of a downtown Los Angeles car dealership, 
revved up an expensive car, smashed it through the plate glass window and was 
last seen heading for the Harbor Freeway, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
An expensive Mercedes Benz or customized Nissan costing as much as $40,000 was 
missing from the showroom of Downtown L.A. Motors at 598 W. 18th St., Lt. Paul 
Pesqueira said. An inventory in progress was the reason for the uncertainty 
over the type of car. 
</P>

The break-in occurred after 11 p.m. Thursday. "He got into a new car in the 
showroom, drove through the front glass sliding door and over the curb," 
Pesqueira said.

complaint months ago about questionable behavior of a school bus driver 
arrested last week on charges of drunk driving.

Marhle said she wrote in a Sept. 18 letter that Lone got lost and stopped at a 
liquor store, where he left the children unattended for several minutes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 MEXICANS MAY SUE SHERIFF, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge ruled Friday that five Mexicans whose civil rights 
were found to have been violated by San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies 
may seek damages against Sheriff Floyd Tidwell. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said Tidwell can be held 
personally liable for the damages if the jury determines that he has 
perpetuated a policy of misconduct among his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The claims of the men against Tidwell and the county will be pursued in the 
second phase of a civil trial that is to begin March 1. Three of the men were 
awarded $956,000 in the first phase of their multimillion-dollar police 
brutality suit against the five deputies who allegedly brutally beat them in a 
racially motivated incident in Victorville on June 30, 1988. The incident began 
when deputies responded to a complaint of a loud, drunken party.

Four floors of a downtown Los Angeles high-rise occupied by International 
Business Machines Corp. were flooded early Friday when an air conditioning 
water pipe burst. 
</P>
<P>
The floors in the Wells Fargo Center at 355 S. Grand Ave. were drenched with 
about 40,000 gallons of water, standing 2 inches deep in some places. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-inch pipe apparently ruptured on the 16th floor and the water flowed 
to the 15th, 14th and 12th floors before it was shut off, City Fire Department 
spokesman Jim Wells said. The cause and extent of damage to IBM sales, 
education and corporate offices was not immediately known.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT SEEKS TO HALT DEVELOPMENT IN 
FOOTHILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to stop a 272-unit housing development on 220 acres in the San 
Gabriel Mountain foothills, the Friends of La Vina, an Altadena group opposed 
to the project, filed a lawsuit Friday against Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, asks the court to overturn the 
county supervisors' approval of the project. The suit argues that county 
officials violated the California Environmental Quality Act by approving the 
project without first conducting biological and archeological studies. 
</P>
<P>
The project, in the Angeles National Forest at the northern end of Lincoln 
Avenue, was proposed 3 1/2 years ago by developer Tim Cantwell in partnership 
with Southwest Diversified Inc.

WIDESPREAD INSURANCE SCAM TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outlining what they termed a scam that has helped inflate insurer losses in the 
beleaguered assigned-risk auto insurance system, insurance agents from Los 
Angeles and Orange counties testified at a state Insurance Department hearing 
Friday that they had been illegally offered up to $1,250 to refer accident 
victims to lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The agents said that sometimes as many as five passengers in a vehicle are 
referred at the same time, bringing the agents who might otherwise simply pay 
off the claims themselves thousands of dollars in payments from personal-injury 
lawyers. An average referral fee is about $900 per person, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ambulance-chasing on a grand scale," said Donald R. Stewart, executive 
director of the American Agents Alliance. "Sometimes, it's through agent 
referrals. Other times, it's through advertised phone numbers that are easy to 
remember, (such as) 222-2222 for Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Calls to the number Friday were answered by a Spanish-speaking operator. She 
said no lawyer was on hand to respond to the allegations. No representatives of 
lawyer groups testified in regard to the allegations at the two days of 
hearings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paid agent referrals are a misdemeanor violation of the state's Business and 
Professions Code punishable by up to six months in jail and fines up to $2,500. 
However, prosecutions of the unlawful solicitation statute have been 
comparatively few, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
The agents blamed growing insurance company losses in paying claims from the 
state's 1.3 million assigned-risk drivers on exaggerated and fraudulent claims, 
which they said attorneys often make after obtaining referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings turned out to be a powerful demonstration of agent discontent with 
both the state's personal-injury attorneys and the insurance companies. 
Hundreds of agents attended the hearings, vigorously applauding testimony that 
condemned practices of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Heads of agent associations also testified that virtually all major insurers in 
the state are ignoring provisions of Proposition 103 that require them to sell 
policies to "all comers" who qualify for "good driver discounts" by virtue of 
not having more than one minor traffic violation in the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
They said that failure has contributed to a situation in which hundreds of 
thousands of drivers with good records -- particularly in inner-city areas 
populated by racial and ethnic minorities -- are joining the assigned-risk 
system, which was designed to be an insurer of last resort for bad drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the hearings, the head of the board of governors of the Assigned 
Risk Plan, Edward Held of Allstate Insurance Co., testified that claims costs 
among assigned-risk drivers are "out of control" and that the system is 
"unraveling." 
</P>
<P>
Under assigned risk, drivers are allocated to insurance companies in proportion 
to the total business each firm does in the state. In recent years, Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who attended the hearing Thursday, has tried to 
hold down the rates. Gradually, in urban areas, enrolling in assigned risk has 
become cheaper than buying a regular policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has refused for nearly a year to accede to an insurer request for an 
average 112% increase in assigned-risk rates. This has prompted several 
companies to sue to get the higher rates or to be excused from participating in 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Held estimated assigned-risk losses at $600 million for 1989. 
He said that two companies, Cal Farm and Sequoia, now are refusing assignments 
of drivers, and that others, including such major auto insurers as State Farm 
and Allstate, are accepting assignments only under protest. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer representatives testified, however, that pushing assigned-risk rates 
up would be unfair without legislative action to provide a no-frills policy for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, a picture was painted at the hearing of an auto insurance system in 
considerable disarray. The angriest testimony, however, came from individual 
agents who said the prevailing system has put them under intolerable pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Palmer, of Palmer Insurance in Santa Ana, testified that she has incurred 
anger from many attorneys for refusing to make paid referrals.

VICTIM'S KIN BLAST SECURITY AT MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a year after psychiatric social worker Robbyn Panitch was stabbed to 
death at a Santa Monica clinic, her parents criticized the city attorney's 
office for not prosecuting clinic operators and county mental health officials 
for failing to take safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Allan and Gloria Panitch asked the state attorney general's 
office to launch its own investigation into the alleged failure of management 
personnel to protect employees at the Santa Monica West Mental Health center, 
where Robbyn Panitch was stabbed 31 times last Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Jan. 18 letter sent by Santa Monica Deputy City Atty. Jerry P. 
Gordon to 10 clinic operators and county mental health officials, city 
prosecutors decided not to file charges, in part, because of the financial 
crisis in the state mental health care system. 
</P>
<P>
While the "failure to provide for (Robbyn Panitch's) safety was both a false 
economy and a mistake of tragic proportions," Gordon noted, it occurred at a 
time when the county's mental health system was in financial chaos and facing 
severe cutbacks in operations. 
</P>
<P>
Had the 10 administrators been charged with misdemeanor violations, they each 
could have faced up to six months in jail and $10,000 in fines. The one-year 
statute of limitations for filing charges runs out Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon concluded the letter with the admonition that such "serious 
consideration" given to criminal prosecution should prompt "all the affected . 
. . administrators" to ensure the safety of their employees. 
</P>
<P>
But an angry Allan Panitch said prosecution was necessary to "send a message" 
to mental health care administrators that they are required by law to provide a 
safe environment for social workers. 
</P>
<P>
Panitch and his wife were joined at a news conference Friday by Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), who also criticized the city attorney's decision 
not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
"I find this to be an outrageous decision because it exonerates people who, 
according to the investigation, are responsible for the lack of workplace 
safety," said Hayden, who is chairman of the Assembly Labor Committee. "It is 
an absolute legal right for every worker (in the state) to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said he has a bill pending in the state Senate aimed at requiring 
counties to improve safety conditions for mental health workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not even a fiscal issue," he added. "The cost of providing an alarm 
system in the workplace, the cost of rearranging furniture, the cost of locks 
on the doors, according to this report, is negligible." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office declined to comment on Friday's statements by Hayden 
and the Panitches. 
</P>
<P>
David Scott Smith, 26, a transient, was charged with murder in the Panitch 
killing. He told police that he killed the psychiatric social worker because he 
saw her as the "Antichrist" and was frustrated that she was unable to help him. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Wilkinson said a trial date will be set for Smith 
next month in Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Panitches said Friday that their daughter had been fearful of Scott and had 
asked for special security measures that would protect her from him. They said 
clinic officials failed to act on her requests. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the parents sought the investigation of clinic operators and 
the county's Mental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the state's worker safety agency, Cal/OSHA, cited Los Angeles 
County for what it described as numerous security shortcomings at the clinic. 
Many of the problems existed months after the attack on Panitch, inspectors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After her death, the county appropriated an additional $250,000 for security 
measures. But county and clinic officials could not be reached for comment 
Friday on what safety programs have been implemented or equipment installed 
since last February. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Edward T. Fogel confirmed Friday that his office is looking 
into the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be reviewing the (case) for what action, if any, that may be 
appropriate," Fogel said.

ARMENIANS IN L.A. JOIN IN RELIEF EFFORT FOR REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up relief efforts to their ancestral homeland, 10 major Armenian 
groups in Los Angeles on Friday announced the formation of a joint council to 
provide humanitarian aid for fellow Armenians victimized by strife in Soviet 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Armenia Council said it initially hopes to raise $3 million to aid 
Armenian refugees who have fled Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia, and to also 
provide support for Armenians in the blockaded region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a 
predominantly Armenian region inside Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts of Soviet troops to put down the violence, "things will 
remain tense for quite a while to come," predicted Kevork Santikian of the 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation, one of the 10 groups in the council. 
"Attacks will continue against Armenians just because they are Armenian." 
</P>
<P>
Armenians portray the violence in Azerbaijan as a relapse into the 
centuries-old persecution of Armenians by Turkic-speaking peoples. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference at the Armenian General Benevolent Union in Hollywood, the 
council dramatized its appeal by showing graphic videotaped interviews with 
refugees, in the Soviet Armenia capital of Yerevan, who had fled pogroms -- or 
mob attacks -- in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku. Among them were a middle-aged 
woman who had been shot, an elderly woman who said her attack was "too 
horrible" to describe, and a man who had lost a finger and had his face burned 
when a homemade gasoline bomb exploded near him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to door-to-door fund-raising within the Armenian community in the 
United States, the Save Armenia Council said, it will also lobby the U.S 
government to provide humanitarian aid to Armenia and seek Soviet assurances 
that relief supplies will reach the intended destinations. 
</P>
<P>
One destination is Yerevan, already strained with refugees from the massive 
December, 1988, earthquake that killed more than 25,000 people and left more 
500,000 homeless. Another is Nagorno-Karabakh, where 160,000 Armenians have 
been isolated by a blockade by Azerbaijanis. Conditions there were described as 
critical, with food, drinkable water, gasoline, electricity and heating in 
short supply. 
</P>
<P>
The council is collecting donations at the Benevolent Union offices, 589 
Larchmont Blvd. Leaders said the relief effort may be coordinated with a 
continuing airlift by the United Armenian Fund. Using cargo planes chartered 
and paid for by financier Kirk Kerkorian, controlling shareholder of MGM, the 
United Armenian Fund delivered several tons of medical supplies, food and other 
goods in recent weeks -- "a drop in the bucket" of what is needed, spokesman 
Harut Sassounian said.

POLICE SEEK SLASHING VICTIM'S HUSBAND 
</P>

<P>
A Huntington Park woman whose face and body were brutally slashed two weeks ago 
emerged from her protected hiding place Friday to appeal for public help in 
locating her husband, whom authorities are seeking in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Maria del Carmen Ochoa, 25, has been in hiding as part of the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's witness protection program since the Jan. 12 attack, 
which police described as "a fit of jealous rage" by Arturo Ochoa, her husband 
of five years. 
</P>
<P>
She said he told her: "I am going to spare your life, but I am going to mark 
you so you'll never have a husband again." 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, she was hospitalized for five days, and now she and her two 
children, girls aged 3 and 5, are in protective custody at separate locations, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
But Arturo Ochoa, 29, has since made threatening phone calls to her family 
members in an attempt to learn her whereabouts, Sheriff's Department Detective 
Elizabeth Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen any case quite like this before . . . not in this magnitude 
before," said Mackey, who is investigating the case. "This is far beyond wife 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Ochoa appeared Friday at the Temple City substation of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Her face was crisscrossed with scars. On her 
hands, she wore huge bandages that made it impossible for her to wipe away her 
tears as she spoke. An interpreter did it for her. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Spanish, Ochoa gave this account: She said the incident occurred as 
she was driving with her husband from her job as an office clerk in El Monte. 
The two were talking about the divorce she had sought for more than a year when 
Arturo Ochoa asked his wife to pull over. When the car stopped, Ochoa said, her 
husband pulled a butcher knife from under the seat and began slashing her face. 
He also cut her arms and hands as she raised them to protect herself, pushed 
her from the car and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
A passing motorist saw her in the street and stopped to help. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Ochoa has not returned to the couple's Huntington Park apartment since 
the incident, authorities said. But they believe that he is in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are seeking Arturo Ochoa on charges of aggravated mayhem. A 
warrant for his arrest has been issued. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey said authorities decided on charges of aggravated mayhem instead of 
assault with a deadly weapon because the attack involved permanent 
disfigurement to the victim. The more serious mayhem charge allows a penalty of 
life imprisonment without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and her two children will eventually receive assistance from the district 
attorney's endangered witness program in relocating to a permanent residence, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the press conference asked that anyone who knows of Arturo 
Ochoa's whereabouts call 911.

MAN SENTENCED IN SLAYING; CASE LED TO REFORM EFFORT

<P>
A judge sentenced Lawrence Raymond Cowell to 25 years to life in prison Friday 
for the airplane murder of a young Anaheim man, ending nearly eight years of 
trials and court hearings that spurred the victim's family to become leaders in 
a statewide court reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
Cowell, 41, formerly of Anaheim, had been convicted of first-degree murder in 
the April 17, 1982, death of Scott Campbell, whose body has never been found. A 
co-defendant, Donald P. DiMascio, 42, was convicted on the same charges at a 
separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
Both men confessed to undercover police agents in separate meetings in 1983 
that they had killed Campbell and dropped his body from a small private 
airplane flying 2,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean, more than a mile past Santa 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been seven years, nine months and nine days. That's a long time to go 
through a funeral every day," said Collene Campbell, the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Frustration with the court system led Campbell and her husband, Gary, of San 
Juan Capistrano, to become leading backers of an initiative measure that would 
make state courts operate more like the federal system, where the time between 
arrest and trial is usually much shorter. The measure will be on the statewide 
ballot in June. 
</P>
<P>
Collene Campbell's brother was racing entrepreneur Mickey Thompson, who along 
with his wife, Trudi, was shot to death in front of their home in Bradbury on 
March 16, 1988. Their murders are still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells had been close friends with Eugene and Laverne Cowell, the 
defendant's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing on Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Ragnar 
Engebretson said, "I feel badly for both families. . . . I would hope that 
someplace along the line, the rift between you would disappear, because there 
is a saying in my church, 'You don't love the sin, you love the sinner.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to their confessions, Cowell was the pilot, and the actual killer was 
DiMascio, who said he broke Campbell's neck and dropped his lifeless body out a 
door of the plane. But prosecutors contended it was Cowell who hired DiMascio. 
</P>
<P>
Cowell was convinced that Campbell would be carrying a large amount of either 
money or drugs. In fact, Campbell was on his way to Fargo, N.D., to sell a 
pound of cocaine, according to trial testimony.

STUDENTS DEAL WITH TOUGHEST CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Connie Iraheta stood in front of the hospital bed pondering a 
life or death decision. A man, pale and still, lay covered by a gray sheet. His 
destiny rested in Connie's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-grader read the patient's diagnosis with intensity, her eyes 
carefully scanning each detail. She quietly mouthed each word. 
</P>
<P>
"John Smith, 35-year-old comatose patient. Doctors believe he will never regain 
consciousness. . . . Should the tubes carrying food and water be removed, 
allowing him to die?" 
</P>
<P>
Connie's decision was quick and final. 
</P>
<P>
"I vote no," she said, slapping the appropriate button on the voting machine. 
"I don't want him to die." 
</P>
<P>
Determining the mannequin's fate was one of many choices that Connie and her 
classmates from Shenandoah Elementary School in Culver City made on Friday 
while visiting the California Museum of Science and Industry's new exhibit, 
"Designer Genes: Sizing up Bioethics." 
</P>
<P>
Designed to introduce students to complex decisions brought about by 
advancements in modern medicine, the exhibit includes hands-on displays that 
require participants to think about bioethical issues and then vote on what 
should be done: Who should receive scarce organs needed for transplants? Should 
parents give their children growth hormones to make them taller? 
</P>
<P>
Although the scenarios in the exhibit are make-believe, the children may one 
day actually have to face such perplexing problems, sponsors of the exhibit 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to know and hopefully understand that everything you do involves 
decisions and many of these decisions involve conflicts that individuals and 
societies have to solve," said Dr. Patrick Robbie, a Kaiser Permanente 
neonatologist who has done extensive research on bioethics, who was on hand to 
answer students' questions. Kaiser Permanente sponsors the exhibit, which 
opened Jan. 19 and will run until March 17. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Perlow, curator of exhibits at the museum, said children respond to the 
questions very differently than adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is precious to them," she said, adding that the students feel that "we 
have to maintain it at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
The students seemed less inclined to think of issues such as quality of life 
and health-care costs, she added. 
</P>
<P>
But the voting results show that young people can be just as divided on the 
issues as adults. 
</P>
<P>
Students who viewed the display at the Lawrence Hall of Science in Oakland also 
wrestled with "John's" fate. While 8,947 said the tubes should be removed, 
allowing him to die, 5,075 voted against removing them. 
</P>
<P>
There was no consensus from Shenandoah students. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Kavita Maharaj voted to remove the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't even do anything," she said. "He's like a living dead body." 
</P>
<P>
But Danny Walker, 11, said the tubes should be taken out only "if he never 
wakes up." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the family wait though, for "like two months," before 
removing them. 
</P>
<P>
While some wrestled over "John's" fate, others tackled the issue of genetic 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
Students compared their size to cut-outs of the world's tallest and shortest 
people, then climbed on top to see how it would feel to be as tall as the 
tallest person. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I was that tall when I played basketball," said Arthur Cooney, 12, 
adding that he could make a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
But Steven Jones, a diminutive classmate, said that even if given the 
opportunity he would not alter his height. 
</P>
<P>
And, although many of his classmates tower over him, Steven said he was against 
giving a child growth hormones to make him taller. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like people to be the way they are," he explained.

MAYOR FORBIDS ZOO TO SELL ANIMALS TO SUSPECT DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday ordered the Los Angeles Zoo to stop doing business 
with two animal traders who allegedly have been selling zoo animals to private 
game farms, where they are shot by hunters. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers, Earl Tatum and Jim Fouts, were the subject of a report on the "60 
Minutes" television show last week. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums has since begun an inquiry 
to determine what happens to surplus zoo animals. 
</P>
<P>
The "60 Minutes" report focused on the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park, but 
Warren Thomas, director of the Los Angeles Zoo, said Friday his staff has dealt 
with both Tatum and Fouts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the Los Angeles Zoo will comply with the mayor's order and cease 
all dealing with the two until after the parks association completes its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Zoo has used Fouts frequently to transport a variety of animals 
to other zoos, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of our knowledge, he has always been very reputable," Thomas said. 
"When people apply to us for animals, we investigate them. . . . We use 
whatever sources we have available to check these people." 
</P>
<P>
The zoo has done little business with Tatum, Thomas said. "We've only sold Earl 
Tatum one small group of animals in two years," he said, small antelope called 
"duikers." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he believed the duikers went to the zoo in Baton Rouge, La. It is 
"blatantly unacceptable," Thomas said, to sell surplus animals to game farms 
where they may be shot by hunters. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Tatum and Fouts for comment Friday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Thomas on Friday, Bradley said he is "very concerned that we not 
support any individual or business when serious doubts have been raised about 
their professional abilities." Lisa Landres, an investigator for the Humane 
Society of the United States, said Friday there are numerous private animal 
dealers who sell zoo animals to hunting ranches. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a disgusting fact that zoos are irresponsible in overbreeding these 
animals," Landres said. 
</P>
<P>
"When baby animals grow up, they become excess, and animal dealers serve as an 
out for the zoos," Landres said. "They close their eyes. Zoos definitely use 
animal dealers as an out to get rid of surplus animals." 
</P>
<P>
Landres is a former elephant handler at the San Diego Zoo.

A Mexican woman was struck by a car and killed while crossing the freeway near 
the U.S. border Friday night, police said. 
</P>

The victim, 24-year-old Raquel Dominguez, was struck while going east across 
the southbound lanes of Interstate 5 near San Ysidro with her brother, 
according to a California Highway Patrol spokesman. The woman's brother safely 
made it to the freeway's center divide, but she was hit just before reaching 
the divide, the spokesman said.

MONROE FITS NICELY IN A STARRING ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: HIGH-SCORING GUARD AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE HANDLES THE 
SPOTLIGHT WITH APLOMB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RALEIGH, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he is not in a North Carolina State basketball uniform, Rodney Monroe 
doesn't project the image of a basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
He is tall, 6-feet-3 to be precise, but he is slender at 170 pounds and quiet 
and self-effacing. 
</P>
<P>
But. there can be no mistaking that Monroe is the big man on campus. 
</P>
<P>
While standing at the west entrance of Reynolds Coliseum one morning this week, 
Monroe is passed by no shortage of people, from blondes to middle-age men, all 
of whom recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one woman is so trusting of Monroe that she leaps out of her 
cream-colored Firebird, to ask if he will move her car if she cannot come back 
from the athletics office before a parking ticket writer gets there. 
</P>
<P>
"And if I don't see you," she says, "hold on to the keys and I'll get them from 
you later." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe sheepishly admits that the woman is a member of the team's academic 
support unit, but the story indicates just how much folks here love and trust 
Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
"He is universally liked," said Coach Jim Valvano. "I don't know anybody who 
doesn't like Rodney. I can't imagine anybody saying a harsh word about Rodney 
from high school to three years here. He's a wonderful young man." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the fact that he can stick a jump shot from seemingly anywhere 
inside the hash mark may have something to do with Monroe's high popularity 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
But in his modest, almost "gee, shucks" way, Monroe shrugs off his fame. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very nice with all the good publicity," said Monroe. "But you have to 
be realistic and not be egotistical. People are very nice here. They treat you 
very nice." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe has treated Wolfpack fans very nice. The preseason media pick for 
Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year, Monroe has done nothing to 
disappoint, as his 23.3 per game scoring average is second best in the ACC, 
behind Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe has led N.C. State in scoring in all but two of its 18 games, and has to 
be counted as the chief reason for the Wolfpack's 13-5 start. 
</P>
<P>
"After our first game, Dick Tarrant (the coach of Richmond) and I were going 
over each other's teams and we were going over each person," said Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Monroe,' and he said, '20.' I said, '20 what?' and he said, 'He's 
going to get 20, no matter what. It might be a tough 20, it might be a good 20, 
but he's still going to get them."' 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Monroe, a junior from St. Maria Goretti High in Hagerstown, 
Md., got a tough 19, as Duke played excellent defense on him, causing Monroe to 
hit just six of the 26 shots he took from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the typical scorer's psyche, Monroe, less than 12 hours after the 85-82 
overtime road loss to the Blue Devils, already had forgotten that game and was 
pointing to the next foe, Maryland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I had the shots, but they just didn't fall," said Monroe. "I was 
taking 12- to 15-foot jump shots all night and they just didn't hit. I felt I 
could take my man. I hit that shot in practice nine out of 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing is that we suit up again. We have another chance to come out 
and play another ACC team. We've lost two in a row. We have to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Valvano said that Monroe had taken "some atypical shots" for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"What I was responding to," Valvano said later, "was that he had a tough night. 
I think that part of the reason was that he feels a certain obligation to score 
for us, and he knows that we're always going to him because we have a lot of 
plays for him. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're struggling getting points, I think he feels that he has to create 
more. He's always been terrific at just letting the game come to him. The fact 
that I said it is probably more a credit to Rodney than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
The game has always seemed to come to Monroe. At Goretti, where he was named 
The Evening Sun's Player of the Year as a senior, he averaged 27 points, 10 
rebounds, four assists and three steals a game, and hit a 60-foot buzzer beater 
to win the city championship. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated as Maryland's all-time career scoring leader with 3,047 points and 
took his act here, choosing N.C. State over Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there are traces of Hagerstown still in Monroe. He speaks fondly of his 
older brother, who played at Shepherd College, and who he shares more than a 
few similarities. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say that we have similar games," Monroe said of his brother. 
"We have similar sizes and similar builds." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Monroe says good things about his hometown, and a wealth of 
basketball talent there that he seems to have exposed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very big, but there's been a lot of talent that has gone 
unrecognized," said Monroe. "There have been a few players that have got out." 
</P>
<P>
His parents also have exerted a certain healthy influence over Monroe. They 
attend about 12 Wolfpack games a year, and will make the trip here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They've encouraged Monroe, who finished second to Duke's Danny Ferry in the 
league scoring race last year and was on the All-ACC team, to stay at N.C. 
State, rather than passing up his senior year to go to the NBA, where he would 
be a certain first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great," said Monroe. "My mom definitely wants me to stay. My father 
pretty much wants me to stay. I think he's 70-30 (in favor of him staying). My 
heart's pretty much made up to stay. I'm on track to graduate in four years. 
I'm enjoying it right now. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been that way all season. The Wolfpack has been plagued by a cloud of 
suspicion dating back to last January when the dust cover of "Personal Fouls," 
a book written by Peter Golenbock, dropped a host of allegations of NCAA 
violations at the feet of Valvano, including those of cash payments and grade 
fixing. 
</P>
<P>
None of those allegations have been proved, but N.C. State was barred from this 
year's NCAA tournament and placed on probation for two years for other 
violations, including the sale of sneakers by former players. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe said part of his desire to stay is to ride out the rough times. Monroe 
said the team has decided that since it cannot compete beyond March's ACC 
tournament, that the players will revise their goals and concentrate on making 
each game count. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much willing to stick it out," said Monroe. "It's been difficult 
since last January. It was very difficult when they announced (the sanctions), 
but it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all put an emphasis on game-by-game, rather than gearing up for the 
postseason. But we want to win the ACC tournament. I haven't won it yet and 
that's what I'm shooting for."

SOCKERS STREAKING WRONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WICHITA, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The contrast was so apparent. 
</P>
<P>
There were the Sockers, smoldering and wondering. A group of players slipping 
to depths they've never experienced. 
</P>
<P>
And in the other locker room a few feet away were the Wichita Wings, laughing 
and shouting. A team on the ascent, one that is burning. 
</P>
<P>
No, make that Byrne-ing. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who questioned last weekend's trade, in which Wichita acquired forwards 
David Byrne and Keder for defender Mike Stankovic and forward Peter Ward, need 
only to have witnessed Friday's game before 8,887 at the Kansas Coliseum. 
Wichita (13-11) won, 5-4, to hand the Sockers their fourth consecutive loss. 
Byrne had two goals and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
So there was Byrne, a guy who, some whispered, wasn't giving his all in 
Baltimore, standing in front of his dressing area after the game looking 
pleased as punch. Why, his biggest problem Friday was finding a post-game beer. 
There were none left in the cooler. He had done too many interviews. Finally, 
someone found an unopened can in the corner, handed it to him and put a smile 
on his face. 
</P>
<P>
This was Byrne's first appearance as a Wing. Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come to a new team, you want to make an impression," he said. "This 
is a good team to come to. I want to do well, and I want the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
That's about all the Sockers want, too. They just can't seem to make it happen. 
All they earned in this game was a dubious record. Wichita became the first 
team ever to win six in a row against the Sockers, who are now 10-14 and in 
last place in the Western Division of the Major Indoor Soccer League, 4 1/2 
games behind first-place Dallas (15-10). 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman emerged from the locker room looking as if he had gone 
five or six rounds with Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"My, my, my," he said. "Just a lack of concentration. I don't know what was 
going on out there." 
</P>
<P>
A few samples: 
</P>
<P>
First half. Dale Ervine, Wichita's leading goal-scorer with 23, scored first on 
the power play. Soon after, midfielder Ben Collins tied it on a Socker power 
play. Byrne made it 2-1, touching the ball passed goalie Zoltan Toth with his 
right foot. Then, the Sockers tied it again, defender George Fernandez tapping 
in a close-range shot on a crossing pass through traffic by forward Zoran 
Karic. 
</P>
<P>
But things began to get tricky as the half drew to a close. With 15 seconds 
remaining in the second quarter, Collins was whistled for tripping Wing 
defender Gregg Willin -- and given two minutes. The Wings were given a power 
play. Collins said the referee told him it was because he already had five 
fouls in the game. But Collins finished with just three. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the Wings capitalized as the man advantage extended into the third 
period, Ervine scoring 31 seconds in to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Byrne struck again, with the Sockers on the power play. 
Midfielder Brian Quinn made a pass that was intercepted at midfielder by Mike 
Fox. Then Quinn made the mistake, by his own admission, of trying to win the 
ball back. Byrne slipped by unnoticed, and Fox knocked a pass upfield. Byrne, 
now well behind Quinn, dribbled, pulled Toth out of the box, shot off the right 
post and followed with a diving header into the goal. Wichita 4, Sockers 2. 
</P>
<P>
There was one more snafu before this one was over. With 19 seconds remaining in 
the third quarter, after Karic had scored on a Wing power play to make it 4-3, 
they decided to put in a sixth attacker. Hirmez got the nod but couldn't get 
the big, multi-colored shirt pulled all the way down to his shorts. He took a 
few steps onto the field still struggling with the shirt. Tweet. Illegal 
substitution. Hirmez was not properly attired as a goalie. Wichita power play. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hirmez, the conversation went about like this: 
</P>
<P>
Ref: "You have to be fully dressed." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez: "Look at me. Can't you tell I'm the sixth attacker?" 
</P>
<P>
Ref: "That's not the point. You're not fully dressed." 
</P>
<P>
That power play passed without a goal, but Wichita midfielder Pedro DeBrito 
ended the suspense when he scored off an assist from midfielder Goran Hunjak 
with 2:42 remaining to make it 5-3.

EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
ESPERANZA PUTS THE CLAMPS ON WHITLOCK TO BEAT LOARA, 64-59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KOLLEN LONG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esperanza High School Coach Mark Hill couldn't have picked a better position 
for Loara's high-scoring guard, Tes Whitlock, to be in with a game undecided in 
the closing seconds. After all, even Whitlock, who averages more than 30 points 
a game, is helpless on the seat of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Whitlock ended up after turning the ball over while working for a 
game-winning shot Friday at Loara. Esperanza converted the turnover to all but 
seal a 64-59 Empire League victory. The victory keeps Esperanza (14-9 overall, 
6-1 in league play) a game behind Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
With 34 seconds remaining and the game tied, 59-59, Esperanza's Brett Evans 
made the front end of a one-and-one. Evans missed the second, Whitlock 
rebounded and raced upcourt. As he neared an Esperanza trap at midcourt, he 
slipped and lost the ball. Esperanza's Seth Romans grabbed the ball and made a 
layup to give the Aztecs a 62-59 lead with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Hill called it the "critical play of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The rough ending may have been appropriate for Whitlock, who struggled 
throughout against Esperanza's diamond-and-one defense. The 6-foot-2 junior 
guard, averaging 31.6 points a game, made just 4 of 18 shots and scored 17 
points. Whitlock, who credited Esperanza's defense, admitted he took some poor 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to get open more," said Whitlock, who made 1 of 9 field goals 
attempts in the second half. "And when I am open, I'm shooting off-balance." 
</P>
<P>
Credit that to the three Aztecs -- Romans, Walter Forcatto and Matt Thimgan, 
who keyed on Whitlock throughout the game. "We did a great job (on defense)," 
said Hill. "Fortunately, he (Whitlock) wasn't hitting tonight and he took some 
bad shots, which helped." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's offense was led by Joe Foss, who had a game-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Early, it didn't seem that the game would provide any drama as Esperanza raced 
to a 29-14 lead in the second quarter. But Loara (14-4, 3-3) began hitting from 
the outside, making seven three-point baskets in the first half, and took 
advantage of numerous Esperanza turnovers to take a 32-31 halftime lead. KOLLEN

MARINA UPSETS NO. 2 OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marina and Ocean View high schools went at it with no holds barred, but no hard 
feelings, in a Sunset League game Friday night at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded elbows and no-so-subtle shoves in a rough-and-tumble game. 
</P>
<P>
Marina survived the physical play best, posting a 62-61 victory, upsetting 
Orange County's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings won by being tougher in the trenches -- in this case, the paint. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stood back in this game, you were going to get beat up," Marina Coach 
Steve Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Parks, Marina's 6-foot-11 center, seemed to be in his element, 
battling Ocean View's aggressive front line of Jim Gwaltney, Marcel TenBerge 
and Darren Ernst. 
</P>
<P>
Parks finished with 22 points, 17 rebounds and six blocked shots to lead Marina 
(12-8 overall, 4-1 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
"He's used to it," Popovich said of Parks, who played against the nation's 
roughest and toughest at the Nike Camp in Princeton, N.J., last summer. "Wait 
until he gets 20 more pounds on him; they won't be able to move him." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View had enough problems contending with Parks, a junior whose 
three-point play with 1:04 left in the game gave Marina a 59-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Fields, who had nine points for the Vikings, made three of four from the 
free-throw line in the final 39 seconds as Marina held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was Marina's first victory over Ocean View since the 1986-87 season, when 
Mark Georgeson played center for the Vikings. He is now playing at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
The halftime score was 26-26, but Marina took the lead when Parks dunked a lob 
pass from Fields early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings then began to pull away midway through the quarter. Sean Haselrig, 
who had 13 points, scored on a rebound basket, Travis Boyd hit a short jumpshot 
off a fast break, then followed with another jumper and Marina led, 38-31.

The Seahawks rallied, but Marina built the lead back to 50-43 before Ocean View 
came back once again.

The Seahawks climbed to within two, 56-54, but Parks put back a missed free 
throw, was fouled and made the free throw for a 59-54 Marina lead.

A three-pointer by Greg Evans with three seconds left cut the lead to 62-61.

FIGHT MARS VICTORY BY CAPISTRANO VALLEY

Capistrano Valley High School defeated Mission Viejo, 77-63, in a South Coast 
League boys' basketball game Friday night that included a fourth-quarter brawl 
between fans and players from both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, ranked fourth in Orange County, were leading, 67-53, with 3:49 
left when a scuffle broke out underneath the Mission Viejo basket between 
Capistrano Valley's Scott McCorkle and Mission Viejo's Eric Cramer, the teams' 
leading scorers. 
</P>
<P>
The players began shoving each other while battling for a loose ball and Brett 
McCorkle, Scott's brother, joined the fray. Fans ran out of the bleachers and 
joined in several fights that started on the court at the Mission Viejo gym. 
</P>
<P>
Scott McCorkle said the brawl started when Cramer hit him in the face going for 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"At first he was going for the ball and then he was going for my face," Scott 
McCorkle said. "I was poked in the eye against Irvine (earlier this season), so 
I'm kind of touchy about that." 
</P>
<P>
Cramer said the foul was not intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a scuffle," said Cramer, who had ice on a swollen left eye after 
the game. "We were just playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
Officials stopped play for five minutes and at least two fans were ejected. 
Cramer, who had 20 points, was called for an intentional foul and a technical 
foul and was ejected. Brett McCorkle also was ejected and called for a flagrant 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
When play resumed, Scott McCorkle, who finished with a game-high 25 points, 
made three of four free throws that Capistrano Valley was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Greg Amaya then made one of two free throws to cut the deficit 
to 70-54. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said he wasn't sure who to blame for the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not (Capistrano Valley's) fault any more than the fact that (Scott) 
McCorkle is a hot dog," Minier said. "My kid (Cramer) started it when they were 
scrambling for the ball, but (McCorkle) should have backed off. 
</P>
<P>
"If the referees would have had better control, this might not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Coach Mark Thornton said the fans should have stayed in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rivalry and we haven't had any problems the last two or three years," 
Thornton said. "The fans coming out on the court caused the problem. Otherwise 
we would have had this broken up in 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone did a good job -- the coaches, the officials and both principals. 
Everyone did a good job but the fans. The parents and student body have to stay 
in the stands and let the officials and coaches take control." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley also was involved in a brawl in an 87-53 victory over San 
Clemente on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a bad-boy image that we don't deserve," Scott McCorkle said. 
"Teams are out to get us. I think this was frustration." 
</P>
<P>
Scott McCorkle caused plenty of frustration for Mission Viejo. Capistrano 
Valley was clinging to a 44-41 lead with 3:35 left in the third quarter when 
McCorkle hit three consecutive three-pointers to spark a 12-6 run. Chris 
Kostoff added 21 points for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (15-7) won its fifth consecutive game and took sole 
possession of first place in the league at 6-1. Mission Viejo, ranked third in 
Orange County, dropped to 15-6 and 5-2. MIKE REILLEY

ARIAS ENDS SLUMP TO SPARK FULLERTON

<P>
Rene Arias was not a factor in two quarters of Fullerton High School's 76-71 
victory over Buena Park. But the senior guard was the main reason Fullerton won 
the Freeway League basketball game Friday night at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (7-11 overall, 4-1 in league play) remains tied for first place with 
Sunny Hills; Buena Park (8-10, 3-2) falls a game back. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the game's final minutes that Arias made his presence most felt. 
</P>
<P>
Mired in an 0-for-10 second- and third-quarter shooting slump, Arias, the 
Indians' leading scorer (19.5 points a game), broke out of it with the game on 
the line. Fullerton held a 67-65 lead but went on to outscore Buena Park, 7-2, 
to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Arias hit a three-pointer with 1:29 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 70-65. 
He followed with another basket with 1:07 remaining for a 72-67 lead. 
</P>
<P>
He capped off the run with two free throws with 39 seconds remaining to put 
Fullerton up, 74-67. Arias, who made three of 13 shots and scored 12 points, 
said he was undaunted by his cold shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't bother me," Arias said. "I took good shots, they just missed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buena Park Coach Ed Matillo: "He's (Arias) a winner. He didn't hurt us the 
whole game, but when it counts he's going to put it in." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park's Ray Lanier and Donyell Collins helped keep the score close, but 
Collins fouled out with 2:50 remaining and the Coyotes trailing, 67-63. Collins 
and Lanier each scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interestingly tight game," Fullerton Coach Chris Burton said. 
"Neither team could hit the free throws enough to pull away." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took its biggest lead of the night, 61-52, after Jason Black hit two 
free throws early in the fourth quarter. DENNIS KAISER

LA QUINTA KEEPS STREAK ALIVE WITH 62-59 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
La Quinta High School Coach Kevin Kiernan last lost a Garden Grove League 
girls' basketball game five years ago to Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has come close since, until this season. For the second time this 
season, Rancho Alamitos played the Aztecs close but La Quinta prevailed, this 
time 62-59 at home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"You want my job?" Kiernan asked after the game. "I'll pay you to take it," he 
said, joking. "The first one was just like this." 
</P>
<P>
When the teams met in the first round of league play this season, La Quinta 
escaped with a 62-60 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros got 29 points Friday from guard Jenny Newsome and 11 points from 
guard Shellie Tsuji. But the taller La Quinta team had a better-balanced attack 
to extend its league winning streak to 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (18-2 overall, 9-0 in league play) moved two games ahead of Rancho 
Alamitos (12-3, 7-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of our girls," Vaquero Coach Bob Becker said. "They never let 
down. I really felt there were two winners tonight." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia, who was benched Wednesday against Pacifica for 
lackluster effort at practice, played intense basketball through four quarters 
against the Vaqueros, scoring 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Heather Brannan and Tanya Krill were the keys for La Quinta. Brannan, who 
responded with 37 points in Jalewalia's absence against Pacifica, scored 18 
points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Krill, who was on crutches Thursday after suffering strained ligaments in her 
left ankle against Pacifica, hit key perimeter jump shots when the Vaqueros 
packed their zone in on Jalewalia and Brannan. Krill scored 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told her she (Krill) would be out for two weeks," Kiernan said. 
"She said the heck with that. I'm going to tape it up and give it a shot. She 
hit some big ones for us. We wouldn't have won without her." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta scored most of its first-half points going over the top of the 
Vaqueros' full-court pressure for layups to take a 36-32 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke down," Becker said. "There is a girl who is supposed to be back there 
(on defense), but I don't think that was the difference in the game. Krill and 
Brannan: I said before the game their outside shooting could hurt us. 
</P>
<P>
"But we went with the percentages. We said hey, we'll take our chances with 
them hitting outside shots when they are tired. It was a physically draining 
game, and we hoped they would be too tired to make them. We knew they would 
make them inside with their size advantage." DONNA CARTER

CHAPMAN WINS DESPITE TROUBLE WITH FOULS

Although their best player had fouled out, Chapman College Panthers pulled out 
an unlikely 86-76 victory over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
When Roger Middleton got his fifth foul with a little more than 14 minutes 
remaining, the Panthers could have been expected to run and hide. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton had scored 24 points and his play had been a major reason that 
Chapman (10-8 overall and 2-3 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
conference) had built a 10-point lead after leading, 42-34, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was having problems making shots from the inside, but 
it was having no trouble getting to the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Thomas, who played at Mater Dei High School and Stanford before 
transferring to San Luis Obispo, scored 11 of his game-high 27 points on free 
throws. Many of his free throws came after Middleton had fouled him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared when Roger fouled out," guard Von Shuler said. 
</P>
<P>
But Shuler's play was a key for Chapman after Middleton left. 
</P>
<P>
Shuler, who along with guard Chris Martin missed six games after being declared 
academically ineligible early this month, came off the bench to score 14 
points, 11 in the second half. Martin scored eight. 
</P>
<P>
Both added needed depth to the Panthers, because when Middleton left he was 
replaced by starting center Frantz Reyes, who was on the bench with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Without Middleton, San Luis Obispo (13-5, 3-2) made a strong run and took the 
lead, 59-58, with 8:55 to play when Tim Knowles, who played at Mission Viejo 
High, finished a fast break with a layup. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mustangs couldn't pull away and after little-used Beau Pack made a 
three-point shot to put Chapman ahead, 65-63, with about five minutes left, the 
Panthers never trailed.

ANOTHER TRIP BY AZTECS ENDS IN TYPICAL FASHION; 
</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SLUMPING SDSU COULDN'T SHAKE ITS ROAD TROUBLES AT HAWAII. 
JAMISON'S TROUBLE AT THE FREE THROW LINE DIDN'T HELP.

The San Diego State basketball team hit the road again and, as usual, the road 
hit harder. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was the University of Hawaii hitting 60% of its shots -- the 
highest percentage given up by the Aztecs this year -- and forward Shawn 
Jamison's worsening struggle at the free throw line that doomed SDSU to a 75-63 
Western Athletic Conference loss late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii made 31 of 53 field-goal attempts -- including both three-point tries -- 
against an Aztec defense that had led the WAC by limiting its opponents to 
39.9% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison, who scored a team-high 18 points, hit six of 10 from the field but 
missed nine of 15 from the free throw line, including five in a row at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
That added up to the fourth loss in the past six games for the Aztecs, who 
slumped to 11-9 and sixth place in the nine-team WAC at 3-4. Hawaii 16-4 and 
5-2. 
</P>
<P>
But it was just another night, albeit one of the more frustrating, for the 
WAC's accidental tourists. The Aztecs have lost four of five games on 
opponents' home courts this season and 15 of the past 16 over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"That we haven't played as well on the road as we'd like is certainly 
disappointing, but I think sometimes that's the plight of a team that has so 
many new faces," said Coach Jim Brandenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Steinly, the only Aztec who has been around for all three seasons under 
Brandenburg, says, "I thought the win at Air Force (two weeks ago) was a big 
one for us, but it looks like we've still got the monkey on our backs. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it has been a long time since we've been able to put them together 
back-to-back on the road (1988 in a coast-to-coast Hawaii-Miami double) and 
that's disappointing. We've just got to play hard and smart for 40 minutes, not 
30 or 35." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brandenburg: "We played well defensively for a while, and then we had some 
mental lapses that gave them some easy baskets." 
</P>
<P>
Early, it was Jamison's inability to make free throws that set the Aztecs up 
for the fall despite a rare edge in rebounding (28-22). 
</P>
<P>
SDSU led, 14-11, nine minutes into the game when Jamison stepped to the free 
throw line for two shots. A 54% free throw shooter this season -- second lowest 
on the team -- he missed both, and then he and guard Michael Best were called 
for traveling on consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii took advantage, scoring 13 of the next 15 points, and the Aztecs never 
led again. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were able to tie it at 28 with 3:15 left. Phil Lott's short jumper 
put Hawaii back up, 30-28, before Jamison was given the opportunity to turn it 
around on consecutive trips to the line . . . only to miss four more in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't keep my hand down on (the ball), and sometimes I just sort of flick it 
(with the wrist)," Jamison said. "It has to get better for me because it sure 
can't get any worse.' 
</P>
<P>
But it did get worse for the Aztecs. "We got scrambled (defensively), and 
instead of being down four points at the half, we went in seven down (39-32) 
because we let them get a three-pointer," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom-used Joe Hudson, who had spent the week in practice imitating Best on 
the Hawaii scout team, got the opportunity to play with two starters and a 
reserve on the bench in foul trouble. Hudson hit two three-pointers for the 
bulk of his eight points, the first with 21 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The real Best, who had been averaging 13.1 points per game, was held to seven 
and committed six turnovers. He didn't play in the final 5:30 after a 23-foot 
air ball drew a quick hook. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted a quicker team so we could press and get back in it," 
Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs next play Wyoming Monday night at the Sports Arena.

THE MAN WHO SHOWED ELWAY THE WAY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: AFTER LAUNCHING A LEGEND AT GRANADA HILLS, VISTA'S JACK NEUMEIER 
CHANGED THE HIGH SCHOOL GAME IN THE NORTH COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
It was a time when John Elway occasionally went to the no-huddle offense in the 
first quarter and rarely ran with the football, content to leave the scrambling 
to the defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
These were the late 1970s, and Elway was establishing himself as the premier 
high school quarterback in the country at Granada Hills. More significant, 
perhaps, Elway was becoming adept at winning football -- as taught by Jack 
Neumeier. 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier, who coached at Granada Hills from 1960-1978 and in San Diego County 
from 1979-88 (at Fallbrook, Escondido and Torrey Pines), devised for the 1970 
season at Granada Hills a high-tech passing scheme that produced instant 
results and a City Section title. His concept of spreading the defense from 
sideline to sideline was basic, but its application was more difficult. What 
Neumeier needed was a strong-armed quarterback who believed in his passing 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway believed. 
</P>
<P>
Elway understood the wisdom of operating the shotgun on first down when the 
defense wasn't prepared to stop the pass. And he understood the reasoning 
behind sending two receivers to each sideline on goal-line situations so the 
concentration of defenders attempting to stop the run was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Elway not only believed, he achieved. He passed for 5,701 yards and 49 
touchdowns in his three-year career, which ended suddenly with a knee injury 
midway through his senior season in 1978. Playing in only six games his final 
season, Elway threw for 1,837 yards and 19 touchdowns, completing 129 of 198 
passes. 
</P>

"I guarantee it, he could have thrown for over 4,000 yards if he hadn't got 
hurt," said Neumeier, now 71 and living in Vista. "I knew we were going to 
break the national record. . . . I never thought I'd lose John, because I 
protected John." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, then 6-feet-2, 170 pounds, was hurt while scrambling. Oddly, he showed 
few signs in high school of his later running ability for Stanford and the 
Denver Broncos, who will meet the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"When he played for me," Neumeier said, "he wasn't allowed to (run downfield). 
I told him, 'If you take off, you got to get out of bounds. It's amazing he 
hasn't got killed (in the National Football League)." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier's short passing game, in which Elway dropped back only one or two 
steps before firing, also kept Elway away from the pass rush. This was one of 
the keys in Granada Hills' 24-14 regular-season victory over Banning in Elway's 
senior year. Elway completed 12 of 17 passes for 169 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Granada Hills had the best passing attack we ever faced," said Chris 
Ferragamo, who coached Los Angeles Banning at the time and is now a Long Beach 
City College assistant. "Elway would look to the left on a slant pass and then 
throw to the right on a slant, and it was unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Neumeier was one of the innovators in the City. He was using four wide 
receivers and a single back, and that was the thing of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier turned to the passing game and abandoned his ball-control, 
run-oriented offense after his team finished 6-2 in 1969 but failed to qualify 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his passing philosophy, Neumeier said: "Basically, my offense 
spreads the defense across the field. A lot of teams spread the defense the 
depth of the field, like the Raiders, but my idea is to spread them sideline to 
sideline so you never get two defensive backs to cover one receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you catch the defense in a one-on-one, the receiver would go to an 
open spot and should get there before the defender because he knows where he's 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier's offense, which became known as "Happy Jack's Flying Circus," 
continued to fly even after Elway's injury in 1978. Using 5-foot-9, 150-pound 
Walter Seymour as Elway's replacement, Neumeier maintained his pass-happy 
philosophy, and Granada Hills won four of its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering, Elway got one final chance to operate under Neumeier's 
system. Playing in the 1979 Shrine All-Star Game at the Rose Bowl, Elway 
completed 23 of 37 passes for 363 yards and four touchdowns in three quarters 
as his North team overwhelmed the South, 35-15. 
</P>
<P>
Elway's biggest season came in his junior year when he passed for 3,039 yards 
and the team advanced to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Elway, former coach at Stanford and John's father, said "probably John's 
greatest break came from going to Granada Hills and being tutored by Jack 
Neumeier. John was his real protege. He was planning on retiring when John was 
a sophomore but he coached two more years until John graduated, and we're 
thankful for that." 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Fallbrook following the 1978-79 school year, Neumeier wound up 
serving as an offensive assistant for the trio of San Diego County schools, 
whose coaches solicited his assistance. Neumeier coached his third 3,000-yard 
passer in 1986 when Fallbrook's Scott Barrick threw for 3,503 yards in leading 
his school to the section 3-A title. Barrick spent two years (one as a 
red-shirt) at San Diego State before moving to Palomar College, where he passed 
for 3,624 yards last year. He has committed to Stephen F. Austin for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier coached at Fallbrook for six years in the '80s under Tom Pack. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main changes that took place in the 1980s in North County," Pack 
said, "was throwing the football." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier coached his last season in 1988 for Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got more recognition here than in L.A.," said Neumeier, laughing. 
"They weren't used to that stuff here. I think they got mad at me for bringing 
it here." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeier gives the Super Bowl edge to San Francisco because of its 
short-passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen John throw a quick pass," said Neumeier, "and that's a 
disadvantage to John because they can put a rush on him." 
</P>
<P>
But things are going much better for Elway at this stage of his NFL career than 
Neumeier thought they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, I was really discouraged," Neumeier said. "But they've 
changed. They weren't going to the shotgun much then. All they were doing was 
throwing deep and getting a lot of interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
But Neumeier now has no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid at the end of his career, they'll say, 'There's one of the greatest 
athletes with the greatest potential,' and they'll look at his numbers and say 
he didn't have the highest passing efficiency," Neumeier said. "But I'm sure 
he's going to be a Hall of Famer because they'll look at how many games he led 
the team to wins, and that's the important thing."

DAVE DISTEL: AMONG OTHER THINGS . . . BEATHARD TRULY IS THE MAN IN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems to me . . . 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt Bobby Beathard, who discovered that the surfing is better on 
the Pacific than the Potomac, is firmly in control as the Chargers' new general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning, the incumbent coach, seemed quite satisfied with Larry Beightol, 
his incumbent offensive line coach. Beightol, in fact, was listed in the media 
guide as offensive coordinator as well, though this seemed gratuitous in that 
Henning himself better fit the description. 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard has dismissed Beightol as offensive line coach, the leading 
candidate to replace him being Alex Gibbs of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe someone should tell him how things went with the last guy the Chargers 
brought in from the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In the continuing Washingtonization of the Chargers, will Joe Theismann replace 
Pat Curran as a color commentator on the broadcasts? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball fanatics have a theory that a team that loses an inordinate number of 
one-run games is a strong candidate to greatly improve in the following year. 
If a one-touchdown loss in football is comparable, the Chargers would seem to 
be excellent candidates for a similar turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the Chargers played 13 games decided by a touchdown or less in 1989 
and lost nine of them. If those numbers reverse or even out, it will be playoff 
time in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
(Since the reverse is also true, meaning teams with inordinately good one-run 
records will tend to decline, the Padres might not be quite so fortunate. They 
were 30-18 in one-run games in 1989, best in the National League.) 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad the National Football League owners have not been in San Diego for 
the past few days. They would have needed only to walk outside to see (and 
feel) Reason No. 1 why Super Bowl XXVII should be played here in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers and Padres have different ways of dealing with capable and loyal 
employes. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, for example, took their media relations director, Bill Beck, and 
appointed him assistant to the vice-president of baseball operations. The 
baseball ops veep is, of course, Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, in contrast, took their media relations director, Rick Smith, and 
fired him. 
</P>
<P>
The only explanation for the Smith firing that makes any sense, if you want to 
call it that, was that owner Alex Spanos made him the fall guy for the fact 
that Spanos continues to lack in either popularity or acceptance hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
It would have made more sense if he had fired his mirror, because that is where 
the problem can be found. 
</P>
<P>
A good friend of mine probably has the best idea on how to prepare for Super 
Sunday afternoon. He is renting a couple of videos just in case things get ugly 
in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is from Denver, I presume he will get "Nightmare on Elm Street" and 
"Friday the 13th." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's athletic department might be wise to consult with the College 
of Business Administration before beating the drums about yet another ingenious 
money-making (or, in this case, debt-erasing) scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The latest plan calls for the Aztec faithful to buy 30-day packages at a hot 
springs resort for $1,000 each, the athletic department getting a 25% kickback 
on each. 
</P>
<P>
The target figure, as I understand it, is $750,000, which is mathematically 
unreachable because there are not enough rooms to sell that many packages if it 
is booked solid for 12 months a year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the bottom line is that the SDSU athletic department can use 
whatever help it can get from wherever it can get it . . . at least until it 
can play football or basketball well enough to sell games rather than rooms. 
</P>
<P>
My colleague Allan Malamud, in his eternal quest for look-alikes, has missed 
Jack McKeon and Super Mario. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide marketing survey released this week should probably be kept from 
the eyes of National Basketball Assn. and National Hockey League executives. It 
did not paint a rosy picture of San Diego's interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans rank first nationally in movie-going and compact disc players, 
second in cable television viewing, seventh in video cassettes and above the 
national average in attending the theater. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to attending sporting events, San Diegans ranked below the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey should have chosen his guests more carefully for his morning radio 
show. He scraped the bottom of the barrel on Monday morning and was fired 
Wednesday morning. I was surprised it took so long. Usually, The Distel Kiss of 
Death works faster than that. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Lee Hamilton has never called.

GUEST LEADER AKIYAMA BRINGS EVOCATIVE GIFT TO SAN DIEGO AUDIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Following traditional Japanese etiquette, San Diego Symphony guest conductor 
Kazuyoshi Akiyama brought a special gift for his hosts. In Thursday evening's 
Symphony Hall concert he conducted the first local performance of Toru 
Takemitsu's "Star-Isle." The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow 
countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably, 
calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones 
from the strings. This brief musical essay by Japan's premiere composer was a 
welcome present indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama stimulated the players in most of the right ways, leading the orchestra 
in one of its more energetic, persuasive programs of the current season. The 
48-year-old maestro -- he is music director of the Tokyo Symphony and New 
York's Syracuse Symphony -- presided over a vibrant, yet thoroughly detailed 
performance of the Samuel Barber Piano Concerto and offered an urgent, 
extroverted interpretation of Debussy's "La Mer." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Barber's concerto was ensured by piano soloist John Browning, 
who premiered the work about 27 years ago under the composer's watchful eye. 
From his brilliant, authoritative octaves that opened the concerto, Browning 
sculpted a taut, muscular reading that left no doubt of his complete identity 
with the music. He was strong but not flashy, creating a wide spectrum of 
colors that made the piano sound almost orchestral. He was meticulous but not 
fussy, an equally apt description of Akiyama's approach to the dense, colorful 
orchestral accompaniment. Seldom has the orchestra seemed so completely engaged 
in its half of a concerto performance. 
</P>
<P>
Barber had both the good sense and the misfortune never to have been 
sufficiently avant-garde for the musical trendsetters of his day. But now that 
his music is again in vogue, and we hear it with more perspective, it is 
instructive to compare Barber with the current crop of born-again 
neo-Romantics. How many of them display even half of Barber's compositional 
craft or can shape a theme as haunting as his Piano Concerto's lavishly lyrical 
slow movement? 
</P>
<P>
If Akiyama made every moment of "La Mer" exciting and urgent, it must be noted 
that Debussy's sea is usually less turbulent under the baton of most 
conductors. It would be instructive to hear Akiyama conduct Bartok or early 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini's tediously sectional overture to "Semiramide" opened the concert, 
although Akiyama paced it judiciously. It seemed little more than a formality, 
curiously unrelated to the rest of the program. Tonight at 8 in Symphony Hall 
this concert will be repeated; on Sunday at 8 p.m. it will be played in Bowers 
Auditorium at Fallbrook's Potter Junior High School.

HANDING OFF A SUPER AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NEW SERIES THAT FOLLOW THE BIG GAME HAVE A CHANCE TO SCORE BIG -- 
OR FUMBLE BADLY -- OUT OF THE COVETED POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's easy to see why producer Bill L. Norton was ecstatic when CBS executives 
informed him that his comedy/action series "Grand Slam" would debut after 
Sunday's Super Bowl: The National Football League championship game is 
television's most-watched event nearly every year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing back flips when they told me they'd give us that slot. More people 
will see this piece of work that everything I've done in my career combined," 
said Norton, whose credits include co-executive producing the first season of 
"Tour of Duty" and directing the movies "Baby . . . Secret of the Lost Legend" 
and "More American Graffiti." "The time slot following the Super Bowl is the 
premier spot for introducing a new series on television." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, however, that even with the promotional push of the Super Bowl, 
series that premiere after the big game are not a shoo-in for success. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the seven new series that have followed past Super Bowls, only three 
were renewed for the following season, with just two -- "The A-Team" and "The 
Wonder Years" -- becoming certified hits. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of using the Super Bowl to introduce new series began in January, 
1979. "Animal House" had been a surprise box-office movie hit the previous 
summer and all three networks ordered television imitations into production. 
NBC, then the third-place network and seeking a hit of any type, attempted to 
give its version, "Brothers and Sisters," a leg up on the competition by 
scheduling its premiere after Super Bowl XIII. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have that many good time periods then and the slot after the Super 
Bowl was an important time slot for us," then-NBC President Fred Silverman 
recalled. "The problem was that 'Brothers and Sisters' was a teen-age show and 
people who watched the Super Bowl wouldn't watch 'Brothers and Sisters.' " 
</P>
<P>
The first "Brothers and Sisters" ranked only 28th in the weekly ratings and 
quickly foundered on its own, dropping to 51st with its second broadcast. It 
was cancelled that spring. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Brothers and Sisters' was a terrible show," Silverman said. "The audience 
has radar that they can sniff out the real dogs." 
</P>
<P>
The next use of the Super Bowl to promote a series came in 1983 when NBC, still 
seeking to emerge from its third-place status, revived the strategy to benefit 
"The A-Team." The series was scheduled to run from 8-9 p.m. Tuesday nights in a 
time period that had been dominated since 1975 by ABC's "Happy Days" and 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley." 
</P>
<P>
NBC rolled out the series with a pair of two-hour versions on consecutive 
Sundays. The week before the Super Bowl, "The A-Team" received a 23 rating, 
then got a 26.4 after the Super Bowl. "The A-Team" went on to finish the 
1982-83 season tied for 10th in the seasonlong ratings, the highest finish by 
an NBC show in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing you hope happens -- that once people are exposed to 
something, they'll come back to it and the show will have a lasting effect on 
your program lineup," observed Peter Tortorici, senior vice president of 
program planning at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same results could not be repeated the next four years. CBS 
programmed "Airwolf" following the 1984 Super Bowl; it survived until the 
1985-86 season. "MacGruder &amp; Loud" (ABC, 1985), "The Last Precinct" (NBC, 
1986) and "Hard Copy" (CBS, 1987, unrelated to currently syndicated "Hard 
Copy") found even less success, with each show failing to be renewed for a full 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, ABC ran "The Wonder Years" after the Super Bowl, a series that went on 
to finish in a 10th-place tie in the seasonlong ratings and won the Emmy for 
best comedy series. But Neal Marlens, the show's co-creator and former 
executive producer, gives the Super Bowl tie-in little credit for the series' 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways it may have hurt us," Marlens said. "We got a ton of promotion, 
but it was a good two months before we debuted on a regular basis. (Then) we 
got somewhat less promotion than other shows premiering in March." 
</P>
<P>
Marlens also believes that "The Wonder Years" would have been seen by nearly 
the same amount of viewers had it debuted in its normal time slot. 
</P>
<P>
"By the fourth quarter, it was probably the lowest-rated Super Bowl," Marlens 
said, recalling the Washington Redskins' 42-10 win in Super Bowl XXII. 
</P>
<P>
Former network programmer Silverman, now co-executive producer of such shows as 
"Jake and the Fatman" and "Matlock," believes the very nature of the Super Bowl 
telecast can often work against the show following it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a stopwatch and counted from the end of the football game to the 
(next) show, with commercials and the post-game show, it'll be a good 25-30 
minutes," Silverman said. "With remote control, that's an eternity. You've 
given the audience an enormous chance to turn elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Tortorici said he began thinking about what to program after Sunday's game 
a year-and-a-half ago. 
</P>
<P>
The first step of the process was to determine the game's starting time, which 
in turn controls how much of the night's prime-time schedule would be left for 
the entertainment division. (The Super Bowl's starting time is set by the 
National Football League, after consultation with the sports department of the 
network carrying the game.) 
</P>
<P>
The next step was deciding what type of viewer to appeal to with the post-Super 
Bowl show. 
</P>
<P>
"The Super Bowl attracts all kinds of viewers," Tortorici said. "Men aren't the 
only ones watching. You don't get ratings in the 40s and 50s without women and 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought something with good young and male appeal made sense to us because 
they would be there for us. We've had trouble reaching them with our regular 
programming lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Slam," originally set to be a made-for-television movie, fit that bill. 
John Schneider and Paul Rodriguez star as competing bounty hunters. 
</P>
<P>
"When we saw the dailies (raw footage of the scenes filmed the previous day), 
we told them to get scripts ready," Tortorici said. "We saw this as a 
sensational series." 
</P>
<P>
Norton said that he had had discussions as early as last June about the show 
getting the coveted post-Super Bowl time slot for its debut. The only roadblock 
came when CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters resigned last Nov. 30, and 
the network had trouble finding a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
But when Jeff Sagansky agreed a few weeks later to become LeMasters' successor, 
one of his first decisions was to approve "Grand Slam" as the program to follow 
the Super Bowl. It will air immediately after the game in the Eastern and 
Central time zones, but because the game will end at an earlier hour on the 
West Coast, "Grand Slam" won't be seen here until 7:30 p.m. (Channels 2 and 8), 
after the news. The series will thereafter be seen Wednesdays at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Now, advises Marlens, the people involved with "Grand Slam" should sit back and 
hope for a close game that will keep the audience watching right through to the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
"Hope that one team doesn't score 35 points in the second quarter," Marlens 
said, referring to the Redskins' feat in Super Bowl XXII. "The key is to be 
thankful that there will be a significant audience for your first show, but 
don't assume that's going to be the key to success to the whole show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like any large promotional push. It's helpful and nice to get that for 
your show, but if your show's bad, just more people will know your show's not 
worth watching."

After Sunday's Super Bowl of hype on CBS comes Sunday's Super Bowl of bodies 
and car chases. Well, not so super, actually. 
</P>
<P>
Premiering at 7:30 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8 is "Grand Slam," an often mindless, 
plotless, witless, pointless -- but never bloodless -- action-comedy series 
about modern-day bounty hunters. Certain to benefit from the NFL championship 
game as a lead-in, the 90-minute opener racks up fewer laughs than bodies (10), 
with four victims getting blasted away in the first couple of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday night premiere is a case of CBS opportunistically exploiting the 
popularity of the Super Bowl. Three nights later, "Grand Slam" returns in its 
regular Wednesday time slot at 8 p.m. Yes, get it on early so all those kiddies 
can see it. 
</P>
<P>
CBS -- which University of Pennsylvania researchers have concluded was the most 
violent network in prime time in the latter 1980s -- indicates with this series 
that it is also opening the '90s with guns blazing. Baseballs, too. 
</P>
<P>
Hardball Bakelenekoff (John Schneider) is an ex-cop and baseball player who 
picks off some of his human targets with bean balls. Pedro Gomez (Paul 
Rodriguez) cracks self-deprecating Chicano jokes and drives a stereotypical 
Mexmobile. Hardball, who uses brute force, and Pedro, who uses guile, are 
competing bounty hunters who Sunday find themselves pursuing the same bail 
jumper, a murderous drug runner. 
</P>
<P>
Hardball and Pedro just cannot get along. "One of us has to go," says Pedro. 
Don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
This is yet another variation of bickering buddy cops, with the ad hoc team of 
Hardball and Pedro as aggressive toward themselves as toward criminals. There's 
an absolutely obnoxious level of gratuitous violence here, and although 
Rodriguez does inject some wit and style, the story gets stale quickly, as do 
the nonstop cracks about Latinos ("This guy ain't the Frito Bandito, OK?") and 
the squealing car chases, which do little more than waste good rubber. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, this is stupid," says Hardball. "Yeah, you're right," says Pedro. It's 
unanimous.

DOMINGO ILL; MUSIC CENTER SWITCHES OPERAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than three months before the scheduled opening of the L.A. Music Center 
Opera production of "Queen of Spades," the company has announced that the 
Tchaikovsky opera will be replaced by Verdi's "Don Carlo," on the same dates in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
The late switch marks the first time that the 4-year-old company has changed 
productions on such short notice. Generally, opera productions are planned 
three years in advance. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement prepared before he flew to the East Coast for a meeting, Peter 
Hemmings, general director of the company, announced Friday that the change was 
made due to the recent illness of Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish tenor, who was scheduled to sing the role of Ghermann in "Queen of 
Spades," has recently been suffering from influenza and was unable to prepare 
for the role, Hemmings said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Domingo has asked to sing the title role in "Don Carlo," one of his 
better-known roles. Hemmings said that Domingo hopes to perform in the 
Tchaikovsky opera at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
The "Don Carlo" production, borrowed from the Lyric Opera of Chicago, will be 
conducted by Yuri Simonov, who was scheduled to conduct "Queen of Spades." 
Soprano Natalia Troitskaya, who also was scheduled to appear in "Queen of 
Spades," will sing the role of Elisabetta in "Don Carlo," which will be given 
in Verdi's four-act Italian version with English supertitles. Domingo took the 
title role in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Eboli will be sung by Nina Terentieva, a member of the Bolshoi 
Opera who made her Vienna Opera debut in 1987 as Azucena in "Il Trovatore," and 
her North American debut as Eboli with Canadian Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In his U.S. debut, Soviet basso Barseg Tumayan, will sing the role of King 
Philip. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating her Chicago assignment will be stage director Sonja Frisell. Sets are 
by Gianni Quaranta and costumes by Dada Saligeri, the team responsible for the 
new Metropolitan Opera production of "Aida.". 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the company hopes to schedule "Queen of Spades," which was a 
co-production with La Scala, Milan, in a subsequent season. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons holding tickets for "Queen of Spades" who do not wish to attend "Don 
Carlo" may mail their tickets to Ticket Services, L.A. Opera, 135 N. Grand 
Ave., Los Angeles 90012, for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Performance dates and times remain the same: April 20, 22, 25 and 28, all at 8 
p.m.

SINGLETON REFERENCE IN OSMOND PIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found the analogies used by Jim Washburn in his review of Marie Osmond's 
performance to be tasteless and vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
I have followed the story of Mary Vincent since the tragedy, and I am no less 
appalled today by Lawrence Singleton's heinous crime than I was when it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
I find it very difficult to believe that Mr. Washburn could not have found a 
more appropriate way to convey his point. What is next? A reference to David 
Rothenberg? 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that Mr. Washburn could not display some of the feeling and 
sensitivity that he felt was lacking in Marie Osmond's performance.

BOBBY SHORT TO TAKE LOS ANGELES -- FOR A NIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CABARET: THE FAMED CARLYLE HOTEL PIANIST BRINGS HIS QUINTESSENTIAL NEW YORK 
SALOON ACT TO THE WILTERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe New York City's Carlyle Hotel should charge royalties for the use of its 
performers. If they did, the Los Angeles payments for the last week in January 
would be a bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Bobby Short -- a 22-year veteran of the hotel's Cafe Carlyle -- will 
bring his incomparable repertoire of American songs to the Wiltern Theatre. And 
pianist Barbara Carroll, a newcomer with a mere 12 years residence at the 
Carlyle's Bemelman's Bar, is in the middle of a six-week engagement at the 
Westwood Marquee. 
</P>
<P>
Both performers typify the elegant, classic New York style long typified by the 
Carlyle. Short, in fact, has been a principal creator of that style. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first went to the Cafe Carlyle in 1968," he said, "the corner of 76th 
and Madison was considered very far uptown. It's still uptown, of course, but 
not so much as it once seemed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cafe was a second home to a lot of people who lived in the neighborhood. 
We had Finch College down the block and a lot of the girls came in with their 
parents or their boyfriends. It was the kind of place where you went for a very 
civilized evening of drinking and companionship. And, in that sense, I don't 
think it's changed very much at all." 
</P>
<P>
Short may be too modest. In the years he has held forth at the Carlyle, most 
classic Manhattan bastions of sophistication have taken it on the chin -- blown 
away by discos, Perrier and a deflating dollar. That the Carlyle continues to 
be a serene temple of reverence for an image of New York City which barely 
exists any more is largely because of Short's presence. 
</P>
<P>
His real gift is the capacity to conjure up, in his performances, a full-blown, 
Brigadoonesque fantasy of the old, "civilized" New York -- a madcap place, with 
rich men and beautiful women cavorting across a Gotham in which the only real 
problem is how to mend a broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
"The requests I receive are the same now that they were years ago," said Short. 
"I think my repertoire has changed, although I'm still singing many songs I 
learned back in California in the 1940's. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a great reluctance on the part of saloon singers' audiences to 
allow too much change. And that's one of the ironies: They don't like it if you 
do too many new songs, yet they scorn you if you don't do any." 
</P>
<P>
Short laughed. "I try to find a balance." 
</P>
<P>
It was a characteristic response. Balance, along with structure and reason, 
have played major roles in his career -- reflections, perhaps, of the 
strikingly middle-class, Midwestern environment in which he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
In his biography, the now out of print "Black and White Baby," Short put it 
very succinctly: "Except for our color, we conformed in almost every degree to 
the image of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant -- in our manners, our mores and 
our way of life. We were, in effect, WASPs. Colored -- or black, if you will -- 
WASPs." 
</P>
<P>
Short's career has ranged from the vaudeville circuit (which he toured as the 
"miniature King of Swing" when he was 12) to jazz, cabaret and Broadway. He has 
performed with the Boston Pops and appeared as a quintessential New York icon, 
both in commercials (for Revlon and Murjani) and films (Woody Allen's "Hannah 
and Her Sisters"). 
</P>
<P>
But Short has remained true to his past. The cover of his autobiography reveals 
a 12-year-old pianist wearing white tie and tails, smiling broadly into the 
camera. Add a few more years and a pound or two, and it would be a virtual 
facsimile of the Bobby Short who will arrive on stage at the Wiltern. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned, very early on," he explained, "that entertaining is one of the most 
draining things in the world that one can do. You have to draw upon all kinds 
of strengths. The fact that I grew up as I did has been one of the great 
stabilizing qualities in my life." 
</P>
<P>
It's appropriate, therefore, that the Carlyle Hotel, with its solid, old line 
New York status, is the setting for a performer who has always placed primary 
value on the virtues of tradition and poise. 
</P>
<P>
Short, never one to mince words, put it more simply: "I've made the best use I 
could of what I had."

THE MOVING JOY OF T'AI CHI CHIH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB HOWELLS, Howells is a free-lance writer who resides in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's joy through movement," says Justin F. Stone, who originated it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moving meditation," says Bill Pierce, who practices it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the exercise of the '90s," says Corinn Codye, who teaches it. 
</P>
<P>
It's t'ai chi chih, the practice of a series of simple, elegant movements said 
to enhance the flow of the "chi," or life force, through the body. By 
performing these non-stressful, non-aerobic movements, t'ai chi chih adherents 
claim to circulate energy that creates a feeling of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is looking for stress relief, calm," says Santa Barbara t'ai chi 
chih teacher Corinn Codye. "T'ai chi chih is something they can do and learn 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
That simplicity is the key to the growing popularity of t'ai chi chih -- and 
accounts for the difference between it and t'ai chi ch'uan. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Stone, a Carmel artist and musician, practiced and taught t'ai chi 
ch'uan for many years, but found that almost none of his students had the 
patience and discipline to master the 108 movements of the ancient Asian 
discipline. Older people had difficulty executing some movements, and nearly 
everyone had trouble memorizing the long sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Stone decided to develop a series of simpler and fewer movements that would 
yield the same benefits as t'ai chi ch'uan. He developed 20 movements and 
postures that could be easily performed by anyone and called them t'ai chi 
chih, or "knowledge of the supreme ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
Stone began teaching the discipline in 1974. Since then, the movement has grown 
internationally. In the Southland, t'ai chi chih is taught in private classes, 
municipal recreation programs, community colleges and senior citizen centers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everyone who practices t'ai chi chih reports such results as inner 
peace, "centeredness" and a greater sense of joy in living. Bill Pierce, a 
student of Codye's in Santa Barbara, describes feeling "expansive" while 
performing the movements. 
</P>
<P>
"I especially like the fluid quality of the movements," Pierce says. "It's like 
learning a musical instrument and not being so concerned with the notes, but 
rather the expression." 
</P>
<P>
Instructors teach that fluidity by telling students to "imagine swimming 
through heavy air" as they perform such poetically named movements as "bird 
flaps its wings" and "daughter in the valley." 
</P>
<P>
To an outsider, the movements have the elegance of hula, an appearance of 
expressive, slow-motion dancing. "Daughter in the valley," for example, is a 
scooping motion with the hands while the body rocks gently forward, then a 
separating of the hands while rocking gently back. 
</P>
<P>
Though t'ai chi chih is easy to learn, its real benefits are said to come from 
daily practice -- ideally, according to Stone, 10 or 15 minutes in the morning 
and another 10 or 15 minutes in the late afternoon or early evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Properly done," Stone says, "the result should be a flow of energy and a 
feeling of well-being like the aftermath of an internal bath." 
</P>
<P>
Balance is also stressed in t'ai chi chih -- balance, that is, of the two 
so-called components of the life force, the yin and the yang. Yin and yang are 
described metaphorically: Yin is cold, contraction, the receptive, female, 
negative; yang is heat, expansion, the creative, male, positive. 
</P>
<P>
The movements stimulate the flow of each force, then bring them together. Each 
t'ai chi chih movement ends with a balancing gesture called "the graceful 
conclusion" -- a reverent-looking posture with the hands, palm down, at the 
sides and knees slightly bent. 
</P>
<P>
Concentration is stressed as well, but unlike meditation, t'ai chi chih does 
not require silence, chanting or a conscious stilling of the mind. Instead, 
concentration is focused on the soles of the feet -- "to bring energy from the 
heart down to flow through the whole body," explains Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Though much of t'ai chi chih is taught and explained metaphorically, 
practitioners say the results are tangible. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Towne, a Cypress instructor, worked last year with professional golfer Ann 
Marie Palli and this year will work with other golfers on the Ladies 
Professional Golfers Assn. circuit. "Ann Marie found that t'ai chi chih was 
right in line with things she was working on: relaxing her body, mind, focusing 
on her feet to get grounded before a swing," Towne says. 
</P>
<P>
Tais Hoffman of San Clemente teaches t'ai chi chih in a halfway house, to women 
who have just completed a 21-day drug/alcohol detoxification program. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings them right into the present moment," Hoffman says, "so they're not 
thinking of cravings, or what they may be doing later." Hoffman credits t'ai 
chi chih with solving a circulation problem ("I always had cold hands and feet, 
but never anymore") and giving her a "much more balanced energy level." 
</P>
<P>
According to Codye, many practitioners of t'ai chi chih have reported dramatic 
improvements in their physical condition, such as weight loss and relief of 
arthritis symptoms. (St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City teaches t'ai chi chih 
to arthritics in its Center for Health Enhancement, and patients report greater 
mobility, coordination and flexibility after taking the classes.) 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente physician David Walker, himself a t'ai chi chih practitioner, 
affirms the physical benefits of the discipline: "T'ai chi chih reduces stress, 
and if you can reduce your stress, it can work on all kinds of ailments. We 
know ulcers, chemical dependency, emotional neuroses, hypertension -- a lot of 
our common 20th-Century ailments -- are stress-related." 
</P>
<P>
Walker has introduced a number of medical colleagues to t'ai chi chih. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see more of my colleagues do it," he says. "Doctors are some 
of the most stressed people there are." 
</P>
<P>
Those who practice t'ai chi chih regularly report that the benefits spill over 
into their daily lives. Since the practice itself is a process of remaining 
centered during movement, they find it possible to maintain a state the 
Japanese call seijaku: serenity in the midst of activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get lost in the external," says Bill Pierce. "Even walking down the 
street, I'm aware of my life force."

TIME FOR A WHALE OF AN OUTING; 
</P>
<P>
EXCURSIONS: THROUGH MID-APRIL, LANDLUBBERS CAN TAKE TO THE SEAS TO OBSERVE THE 
MIGRATION OF THE PACIFIC GRAY WHALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been bobbing around on your whale-watching boat for an hour or so 
without any success and you spot an unremarkable-looking mottled 
brown-and-white lump in the water, don't look away. It isn't debris, or kelp, 
or a rock. 
</P>
<P>
It's what you came to see. And if you're lucky, in a few minutes something 
spectacular may happen. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a certain eye to be a good whale watcher -- not necessarily to spot 
the great beasts but to know what you're seeing when one appears. After all, 
when a Pacific gray whale leaves its natural habitat and enters ours, the visit 
may last only a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there's a lack of such behavior these days. From late December through 
mid-April each year, thousands of the gray whales, many of them pregnant, 
migrate from the Arctic Circle to the lagoons of Baja California, swimming 
10,000 to 15,000 miles to give birth in the warmer, southern waters. In the 
process, they put on a show that has fascinated Southern Californians for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
So we take to the waves in droves, waiting to spot some of the largest mammals 
on Earth. But when we spot a Pacific gray whale, it's likely we won't see 
anything very gray. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't gray from a distance," said Larry Fukuhara, program director at 
the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro. "The babies are gray, but the adults 
pick up barnacles and scars over the years, and when the barnacles fall off 
they turn the whale's skin white. If you see them through the water, though, 
they have a bluish color." 
</P>
<P>
The first time you're likely to spot a whale, Fukuhara said, is when it 
breathes. Rolling its back above the surface, the whale expels water through 
its blowhole, shooting the water up to 10 feet in the air with a whuffing 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like smoke," Fukuhara said, "and they do it almost every time they 
surface." 
</P>
<P>
There is no rule of behavior governing breathing, but there is sort of a 
pattern, Fukuhara said. Generally a gray whale will breathe and disappear below 
the surface for about a minute, then repeat the process. After the third 
appearance, the whale will make a deep dive that lasts for two to eight 
minutes. As this dive begins, the whale will typically flip its tail -- its 
fluke -- into the air, a maneuver eagerly awaited by watchers with cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Whales also break the surface as part of a behavior called spyhopping, Fukuhara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out of the water (vertically), clear their eyes and come right back 
down," he said. "Nobody really knows why they do it, but it's seen very seldom, 
even less than breaching." 
</P>
<P>
Breaching, for the whale watcher, is the big prize. It occurs after the whale 
accelerates to about 30 knots under water and bursts vertically into the air, 
finally falling sideways back into the sea with a huge splash (an adult gray is 
up to 50 feet long and can weigh as much as 45 tons). 
</P>
<P>
"It takes thousands of horsepower to get them out of the water like that," 
Fukuhara said. "It may be a form of communication. Also, they have a lot of 
parasites on them and it may be a way to knock them off. Or maybe they're just 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Another phenomenon to look for, even if you can't see any whales -- yet: 
"footprints" left on the surface of the water. When a whale submerges, telltale 
rings of disturbed water remain for a few minutes, rather like the glassy 
patches left by the wakes of ships. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most convenient way to go whale watching is aboard a commercial 
boat. But if you're going it on your own, there are laws to keep in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is believed that boats motoring too close to the migrating whales 
will affect their behavior, federal law stipulates that no craft come within 
1,000 yards of a migrating whale, Fukuhara said. Also, it is illegal for a boat 
operator to cut across a whale's natural path or to attempt to separate a whale 
from a group. Too-close attention by watchers in motorboats also may affect the 
whales' underwater communication. 
</P>
<P>
What to bring? Rubber-soled shoes, warm clothes, possibly binoculars or a 
camera (fast film is recommended). 
</P>
<P>
And an eye for the particulars of the world's longest migration. 
</P>
<P>
Join an Excursion to See the Whales 
</P>
<P>
Whale-watching excursions are offered at several locations in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Many trips are narrated by experts in the study of sea 
mammals, and reservations are usually required. Group rates are often 
available, as are "whale checks" -- free passes for another trip if no 
cetaceans (including porpoises and dolphins) are spotted. Many of these firms 
offer cruises that are not designed for whale watching, so specify the kind of 
excursion you want.

'WINTER SILHOUETTES' BONSAI SHOW EXHIBITS THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
NURTURED MINIATURE TREES, NOW LEAFLESS, SEEM MAGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The art of dwarfing trees in containers is said to have originated centuries 
ago in the mist-shrouded mountains of China. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe these potted trees of hauntingly beautiful detail and extremely 
long life played a part in the magical practices of Taoist sages seeking 
immortality. Others think that this art, which we now know by the Japanese term 
bonsai, was a purely artistic extension of the landscape painting and 
calligraphy perfected by the Chinese cultural elite. 
</P>
<P>
From China, the tradition of growing miniature trees was taken to Japan, where 
the art reached its greatest development. From Japan, bonsai spread to Europe, 
the United States and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the Winter Silhouettes bonsai show at the Los Angeles State and 
County Arboretum exhibits the best work of California's own bonsai masters. The 
trees displayed, all deciduous species in their leafless stage, are such 
perfect miniatures of full-grown trees that they do, indeed, seem to verge on 
the magical. 
</P>
<P>
The vitality of the Southern California bonsai community can be traced to the 
founder of the Winter Silhouettes show, Frank Nagata, a nurseryman and bonsai 
teacher who died in 1980 at the age of 90. Nagata was one of the first to 
interest non-Asians in learning bonsai techniques; today his former students 
are teaching the art throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After Nagata's death, his daughter and son-in-law, Kay and Khan Komai, 
themselves bonsai teachers, decided to carry on the tradition of a winter 
exhibition of deciduous trees, believed to be the only such bonsai show in the 
country. Winter Silhouettes, sponsored by the Baikoen Bonsai Kenkyukai study 
group, is in its 11th year as a memorial to Frank Nagata. 
</P>
<P>
Each year a select few of the state's top bonsai artists are invited to show 
their work that best evokes a winter scene or mood. 
</P>
<P>
The elms, liquidambars, ginkgos, maples and other trees displayed have no 
leaves to obscure the austere beauty of their trunks and branches, or to hide 
defects in their training. To exhibit a tree in its leafless stage is a test of 
the bonsai artist's skill, because any flaw in his work is readily apparent to 
his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Although evergreens are excluded, flowering deciduous trees are not, and 
quinces, pears and Frank Nagata's favorite bonsai subject, the ume or flowering 
apricot, are likely to be in bloom for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Bonsai's place in the American cultural blend is seen in the work of this 
year's honored exhibitor, Melba Tucker, a Colorado farmer's daughter, who 
became an acclaimed artist and educator in what traditionally had been a man's 
art form. 
</P>
<P>
She had admired bonsai for many years before 1963, when she was given a 
decorated Italian stone pine as a Christmas gift. Intrigued by the possibility 
of turning her Christmas tree into a bonsai, she began studying under Khan 
Komai and soon was on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker has taught bonsai for 18 years at Arroyo High School near her El Monte 
home and has traveled to Canada, Australia, South Africa and Colombia to 
conduct workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the technical and aesthetic challenges of creating bonsai, she 
describes herself as "the kind of person who says, 'If you can do it, I can do 
it.' " That attitude -- as American as the hornbeam tree collected in Maryland 
in 1973 that is one of her prize creations -- has made her a respected artist, 
influential teacher and technical innovator. 
</P>
<P>
An example of Tucker's fresh approach, which can be seen at the arboretum, is a 
potted group of five trident maples in the saikei (landscape) style, the 
exposed roots of each tree firmly clasping the volcanic rock on which it is 
planted. Getting roots to grip rocks is a difficult, slow and painstaking 
process, but, using very young trees, Tucker pioneered a method that produces 
show-quality trees in the clasping-rock style in six to eight years -- record 
speed for bonsai. 
</P>
<P>
In her classes, Tucker encourages the use of native trees, such as California 
juniper, planted on native stones, including the porous "lace rock" found near 
San Simeon. For accent pieces to display with trees, she uses suiseki or 
viewing stones, many of which she collected in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring remote canyons, she found the veined and pigmented stones she needed 
to represent snow-capped mountains or waterfalls cascading over a cliff. Eight 
miles by dune buggy into a seldom-visited ravine, she made one of her best 
finds -- a richly colored stone in whose markings can be seen the figure of a 
geisha. If there is anything as rare as a geisha in the Mojave Desert, it's 
Melba Tucker, a woman who has achieved the highest standards in the demanding 
art of bonsai. 
</P>
<P>
The Winter Silhouettes bonsai exhibition runs today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, 301 N. Baldwin Ave., 
Arcadia. (818) 446-8251. Arboretum admission: Adults $3, children 75 cents.

PHOTOGRAPHY: READY TO SELL OR EXHIBIT YOUR WORK? PREPARE FOR REJECTION; HANG 
TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may come a time when you start to think of photography as more than a 
hobby. It could happen when a friend or neighbor suggests that you sell your 
work. Or perhaps you begin to think that your photographs are better than some 
of the published art you've seen. 
</P>
<P>
You need to know, however, that changing your status from amateur to artist can 
be challenging. Sometimes the preparation takes longer than producing the work. 
And you have to prepare for a lot of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Although artists don't always exhibit their work, most want their material 
recognized and sold. Finding a place for this is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We have such limited opportunities for artists to exhibit," said Miriam Smith, 
owner of Art Resource Group located in Laguna and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's company matches corporate and private clients with artists who want to 
sell or rent their work. She is also involved with multisite shows of local 
artists for corporate display. Among the burgeoning areas for new artists in 
Orange County are the lobbies of corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate space offers a kind of alternative space which is really needed," 
Smith said. "The Koll Co. has designated one building (the Wells Fargo building 
at Birch Street and MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach) only for Orange 
County artists." 
</P>
<P>
Latham and Watkis, a law firm in Costa Mesa, has a photography collection and 
also exhibits only Orange County artists. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the competition for display space is steep. She receives about 100 
submissions a month, with half of those coming from local artists. "I know 
there are a lot of artists out there working, but I am amazed at how much work 
comes in and how many new artists I see," she said. "You can tell a lot 
initially from the slides." 
</P>
<P>
Photography does very well in the corporate environment. Smith says she is 
always looking for photographs to display. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has been bringing artists together with her clients in Orange County 
for seven years, says she understands the artistic side of the process because 
she has been a painter for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists are not always treated with the kind of respect they deserve," Smith 
said. "I always try to respond to an artist with a letter when they send in 
slides." 
</P>
<P>
Another display space for the novice artist is a community center, such as the 
Irvine Fine Arts Center. It provides exhibition space and classes for artists 
at various levels. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrit Fitzgerald, curator of exhibitions for the center, receives about 40 
submissions a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel committed to communicating with the artists if their slides need 
improving or referring them to the appropriate gallery," Fitzgerald said. 
"Artists are not trained how to approach (gallery curators) and they can really 
try your patience." 
</P>
<P>
She recommends that artists ask for a gallery schedule to see if their 
photographs are compatible with any of the gallery's scheduled shows. 
</P>
<P>
Patience is essential: Artists should not call a week after their slides were 
mailed and expect a response. It may take from one to three months for an 
institution to review the work, and it would probably be one to two years 
before an exhibit of your work could be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Make a good first impression. Most curators prefer to view slides, so it's 
important to have quality slides of your work. Also, invest the time to ensure 
that your submissions have a focus. 
</P>
<P>
If you're just starting out, join an artist group to make the appropriate 
contacts. The Art Associates based in Huntington Beach is one of many such 
groups. They provide lectures, group exhibitions, juried shows and information 
for the beginner and experienced artist. They meet on the second Monday of the 
month at 7:30 p.m at the Central Library in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Photography column, which runs Saturdays in Orange County Life, is intended 
to help both the serious amateur and weekend shooter.

Steffi Graf survived a surprisingly tough match against American teen-ager Mary 
Joe Fernandez to win the Australian Open women's singles today (Saturday) for 
her third consecutive Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, winning the Australian for the third successive year and gaining her 48th 
consecutive match victory, came back from a break down, 1-4, in the second set 
to beat Fernandez, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play my best, but I won it," the top-ranked Graf said. "Mary Joe 
played as I expected her to. When you're in a Grand Slam final, you tend to 
play your best." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, ranked 11th, was proud of being able to play a close match against 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second set, it was a point here and a point there. I should have won 
it," Fernandez said. "I played pretty much with her during the match." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few key points made the difference in the well-played, tense duel in 
which Fernandez, 18, of Miami, displayed poise and savvy in exposing a weakness 
in the 20-year-old West German's game. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, playing her first Grand Slam final, pounded her two-fisted backhand 
into Graf's relatively weak backhand side, then came back with winners down the 
line to Graf's forehand. 
</P>
<P>
Graf made 14 of her 27 errors in the second set on her backhand, as Fernandez 
kept the ball deep and generally prevented Graf from attacking the net, as she 
likes to do. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, winner of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year and nine Grand Slam 
titles overall, put away only two volleys in the match -- both in the second 
set. But if Fernandez found a chink in Graf's armor, Graf almost exposed one in 
Fernandez's. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of Fernandez's errors came off her forehand -- 17 of 22 in the 
first set and 17 of 25 in the second set. The match thus came down to each 
trying to use her strengths: Graf's forehand, Fernandez's backhand; and exploit 
the other's weakness: Graf's backhand, Fernandez's forehand. 
</P>
<P>
Graf broke Fernandez only once in the first set to go ahead, 4-2, as Fernandez 
hit a backhand wide and a forehand into the net on the last two points, then 
went on to take the set in 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez broke Graf in the second game of the second set when Graf hit a wide 
backhand on break point. Graf saved two break points after falling behind, 
0-40, on Fernandez's forehand return of service down the line, but couldn't 
hold the game. 
</P>
<P>
When Fernandez took a 4-1 lead, Graf was starting to think about a third set. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I thought that was possible," Graf said. "But I felt she was getting 
tired. I was prepared to play a third set more than (Fernandez)." 
</P>
<P>
But Graf broke back in the seventh game when Fernandez hit a backhand wide. 
Graf polished off her own service with an ace, then went ahead, 5-4, with 
another break. Graf won the last two points of that game on a short, sweet 
cross-court backhand that flew past Fernandez after she came in on a drop shot, 
and then a forehand that Fernandez hit into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Graf served out to win the match in 1 hour, 21 minutes and picked up $190,000. 
Fernandez earned $94,500. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who won all four Grand Slam events in 1988, has won $5.4 million.

NFL LIKELY TO ADD WEST GERMANY TO EXHIBITION SITE LIST

So you think team names like the Berlin Walls or the London Bridges have a ring 
to them? Well, there is increasing talk these days among pro sports leagues of 
expanding into other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball has toyed with it for years and now has teams in Canada. The topic is 
one of NBA Commissioner David Stern's favorites. And Friday, at the annual 
Super Bowl press conference conducted by the commissioner, Paul Tagliabue 
talked about it. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has played exhibition games in Tokyo, London and Goteborg, Sweden, and 
Tagliabue said that the league probably would play a game next season in West 
Germany, in either Frankfurt or the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also noted that this year's Super Bowl was being televised in 50 
countries and that there were 10 crews here to originate, in 10 foreign 
languages, Super Bowl telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the NFL issued 126 credentials to print and broadcast outlets in 17 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dr. Forest Tennant drug story left most journalists here with a bad taste. 
It was pursuit of a complicated non-story with all sorts of side issues, ego 
trips and grinding axes. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Martin, columnist of the Florida Times-Union, said: "We've got to 
remember. This isn't journalism. This is the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Bauman, columnist for the Milwaukee Journal, recalling his feelings 
while trying to squeeze into the crowd of reporters swarming all over a 
slightly amazed Joe Montana for comment Thursday, said, "Afterward, I felt like 
I needed to take a shower." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka, coach of the Chicago Bears, took great exception to all the heat 
being put on Tennant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a bunch of garbage," Ditka said. "Tennant is one of the most 
honorable men I know. I've worked with him very closely." 
</P>
<P>
In the category of, Let's play the game, please! 
</P>
<P>
In Tagliabue's press conference, which lasted one hour and seven minutes, the 
game itself was not mentioned. It was all about issues and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Two players were mentioned, Joe Montana and the Broncos' John Elway, but they 
came up in connection with Tagliabue's anger over drug innuendo surrounding 
them as white quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was kidded because, in the past, souvenir NFL footballs, with 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle's name on them, were sold at Super Bowl time for $49. 
This year, the footballs have Paul Tagliabue's name on them, and are selling 
for $57. 
</P>
<P>
"We price them by volume, plus I have more letters in my name," Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
The father-in-law of Michael Young, Bronco wide receiver, died earlier this 
week and will be the subject of a memorial service in Young's hometown of 
Visalia next Thursday. Don Bratten, 58, father of Jill Bratten Young, died of 
pneumonia complications while suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
What do NFL officials do for a living when they aren't tossing flags into piles 
of players on weekends? Here's a rundown of Sunday's Super Bowl cast: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dick Jorgensen, the referee, is the president of a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hendi Ancich, the umpire, is a longshoreman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Earnie Frantz, the head linesman, is the vice president and general manager 
of a land title company. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Bluhm, the line judge, is a teaching golf pro. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Al Jury, the back judge, is a state traffic officer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gerry Austin, the side judge, is an associate superintendent for a county 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Don Orr, the field judge, is a mechanical contractor. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco running back Roger Craig returned to practice after missing part 
of Wednesday's drill and all of Thursday's with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel stronger than I have felt over the last two days," Craig said, "but I'm 
still a little weak. Hopefully, I'll be 100% by Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Tillman, a 49er special teams player, missed Friday's practice with the 
flu, and linebacker Keena Turner was given the day off to rest his legs. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert also announced Friday that Michael Carter 
has recovered enough from his foot injury to start in place of Pete Kugler at 
nose tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Former coach Bill Walsh attended practice Thursday and visited with safety 
Ronnie Lott and Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco Coach Dan Reeves said it's difficult to tell how tailback Bobby 
Humphrey's cracked ribs will hold up Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you anything new on him from what I said last Wednesday," Reeves 
said. "Until he is hit in the game and hits the ground, we really won't know. 
He will start because of his running in practice, but he hasn't hit the ground 
when someone lands on him. He hasn't felt that pressure." 
</P>

THIS SEASON WASN'T BOOKMAKERS' BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said he is a student of gambling, but that hardly makes him the wizard of 
odds. He lost $40,000 this year as an illegal bookmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"But logically, it's more," he said, then grinned. "I figure with the value of 
my time, I should have won about $50,000. So this year cost about $90,000." 
</P>
<P>
Taking time from the busy Super Bowl betting season, Bill agreed to discuss his 
trade on condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
So why was he smiling after talking about a $40,000 loss? Because, he said, he 
was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"What I hear, this has been one of the poorest seasons for the bookmaker," Bill 
said. "The players I knew who were constant losers had banner years. Bookmakers 
did not have a party this football season." 
</P>
<P>
The prospects are doubtful that it will change now that the biggest sports 
party of them all is upon us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad that it's San Francisco and Denver from a bookmaker's view," he said. 
"The closer the game, the more interest. It makes a difference who is involved 
because there would be more money bet on a closely contested game than a 
one-sided game. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very meaningful to TV that this game was between the Cleveland 
Browns and Rams, which might be a pick 'em (even point spread) rather than 
(this)." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, which started as a 10-point favorite, is listed at 12 1/2 or 13. 
</P>
<P>
Bill, who said he once was a gambler, laments the use of computerized data 
systems that he says help bettors reduce the bookmaker's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed what these touts can tell people," he said. "This team lost seven 
out of eight on artificial grass, but on regular grass they've won every game. 
I didn't know that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Some have enlisted computers to analyze the information, then predict winners. 
Computer Group, headed by Dr. Ivan Mendlin of Las Vegas, was investigated by 
FBI agents in 1985 because of its successful sports betting ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Computer Group) comes out with a choice on a given weekend, there is 
like a raging fire," Bill said. "The quotation is: the Computer boys picked 
this game. Then the whole country goes with that game. I'll never forget one 
week it was Army. I'll tell you there were people who never bet Army in their 
life. All of a sudden on this day, they couldn't wait to get down on Army. And 
they won. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not betting their opinions so much. They're not the rank suckers that 
I used to deal with. So it is more difficult today." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Bill said bookmakers can earn between $40,000 and $60,000 a year 
with a low-profile operation. However, most who have visible operations earn 
six-figure incomes, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
This, for the 16-week National Football League regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say I want to try to win a half-million dollars," Bill said. "I'd have 
to stay open the entire year, and become a year-round sports book and hire 
agents. If I want to hire three or four clerks, get some agents I can build a 
multimillion-dollar business, get famous and go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
To develop a successful business, Bill said, bookmakers must be aware of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
"This business is built entirely on credit," he said. "And credit that is 
unenforceable on both sides. What you have going for you is your ability to pay 
. . . your reputation in your ability to pay the bettor who wins. What's 
important is the customers' ability to pay. The fact is, (it) is so easy to 
wager excessive amounts of money because it is difficult to determine what a 
person can afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more interested in credit than I am in how many games I win or lose at the 
end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Bill said avoiding police detection starts with doling out credit. He said he 
puts stringent limits on his bettors, so they do not become too indebted. If 
they lose too much, the trouble begins. 
</P>
<P>
"The bettor may give your number to the police hoping you will get arrested," 
Bill said. 
</P>
<P>
Or a spouse discovers the bookmaker's telephone number and informs authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When wagering records are confiscated, the bookmaker has no proof of what is 
owed. Suddenly, the week's previous bettors claim winners. 
</P>
<P>
"If bookmakers want to hold their customers, they'd better pay them," he said. 
"So it can be costly."

CONTROVERSY CONTINUES TO DOG TENNANT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG TESTING: LATEST DEBATE ON WEST COVINA DOCTOR'S ABILITY MIGHT COST HIM 
POSITION WITH NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Forest Tennant shy away from controversy? 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the West Covina physician was asked about his penchant to 
irritate everyone from Los Angeles County politicians to the NFL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I've not only ruffled some feathers, I've run them over like a steamroller," 
he said in an interview in 1986. "If I don't have some adversaries out there, 
I'm not accomplishing anything." 
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's best-known drug doctors and former mayor of West 
Covina, Tennant has accomplished plenty in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, all the while he has received recognition for good deeds, his image has 
been tarnished by criticism of incompetence. Tennant's abilities were 
questioned again this week after a Washington television report was critical of 
his role as NFL drug adviser. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Friday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the NFL did little 
to dispel rumors that Tennant, 49, will soon be fired by the league. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of Tennant were not surprised by the latest debate. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1983, Tennant apparently reversed himself on the witness stand during a 
highly publicized trial involving drug overdoses by an Orange County doctor. 
Based on Tennant's report, the Orange County District Attorney's office 
prosecuted the case. When Tennant offered a different account on the stand, the 
case was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1984, as head of the Dodgers' drug prevention and treatment program, 
Tennant told a newspaper reporter that he had a list of players involved with 
drugs, which surprised team officials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1984-85, Community Health Projects Inc., a nonprofit network of drug 
clinics in Southern California founded by Tennant in 1974, had problems with 
the State Department of Health Services. A state agency audit found 
discrepancies in billing procedures to Medi-Cal. Tennant denied any wrongdoing, 
but the company was ordered to pay reimbursements for overcharges. It was one 
of several times it was ordered to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1986, L.A. County health officials registered their concern over the 
maintenance of Community Health's methadone program. Community Health Projects 
eventually canceled its $272,000-a-year contract with the county to provide 
methadone treatment for indigent heroin addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1986, Tennant conducted a public feud with L.A. County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum over the construction of waste-to-energy incinerators in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1986, as newly appointed NFL drug adviser, Tennant disclosed plans to 
specially monitor six New England Patriot players for drug use. The Players 
Assn. accused Tennant of violating rules of confidentiality and called for his 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1988, Tennant told a group of Alaskan businessmen that the Dodgers' 
success that season was partly traceable to management's alleviation of the 
team's drug problem. Dodger officials expressed disappointment over the 
remarks, and Tennant later was dismissed as the team's drug adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1989, a report in Sports Illustrated characterized problems with the 
NFL's drug-testing methods in which Tennant was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Tennant told The Times that the magazine article was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole story is nonsense," he said. "I'm a public figure. I never thought 
as a physician that I would get the kind of criticism that I get in the media 
from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also in 1989, Tennant's rapid-eye exam, a home drug-prevention kit, was 
criticized by some drug-testing experts, doctors and a Boulder (Colo.) superior 
court judge. The rapid-eye exam, which sells for $49, has prompted a debate as 
to whether it is an effective tool or a gimmick to make money from the concern 
over drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant told The Times that his detractors do not understand the eye exam. He 
said that when used properly, the test can stop drug use in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Tennant was not defending himself from the latest volley. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Ethridge a spokeswoman for Community Health Projects, said: "Dr. Tennant 
is very hopeful there is a time when he can speak openly about all this." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant's lack of comment is uncharacteristic. 
</P>
<P>
As a farm boy from Dodge City, Kan., Tennant worked his way through the 
University of Kansas Medical School by selling crystal and fine china door to 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Like his parents who had sold Bibles in the Midwest during the Depression, 
Tennant learned the importance of personal contact. 
</P>
<P>
"It paid off handsomely," he said in 1986. "I got used to having people who 
didn't like me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, two years after earning a medical degree from Kansas, Tennant was an 
Army surgeon based in West Germany. There, his profession took an alternate 
course as he learned of the Army's drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
He used information gleaned from treating service personnel as the basis for a 
doctorate thesis at UCLA School of Public Health in 1972. Then, as a 
post-doctorate fellow, Tennant was appointed director of UCLA's methadone 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The school rented a building in West Covina, where Tennant's staff dispensed 
methadone daily to heroin addicts. This eventually became the basis for 
Community Health Projects, which has grown into a multimillion-dollar 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the organization's recognition from work with professional athletes, 
Tennant was often called to testify as an expert witness in drug trials. Also, 
he has been a consultant to the California Highway Patrol, teaching officers 
how to recognize symptoms of drug use. His rapid-eye exam has been praised by 
law enforcement authorities as an effective means in field sobriety tests. 
</P>
<P>
The test today is whether Tennant can withstand the mounting criticism. Judging 
from his past, his supporters believe he will weather this latest storm. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever his personality is," an Orange County physician once said, "his work 
is what really is important."

Plans to build an $85-million indoor sports arena in Anaheim were halted by an 
Orange County Superior Court commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
After three lawsuits opposing the arena were filed, Commissioner Julian 
Cimbaluk stayed arena plans until Feb. 14, when another hearing will be held on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits were filed by the owner of Orange Tree Mobile Home Park, adjacent 
to the proposed arena site, and by the Rams and Anaheim Stadium Associates, a 
development firm. The lawsuits claim Anaheim hastily approved the project 
without regard for its environmental effects.

JACK AND LEE ARE ROOKIES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: WHEN THEY JOIN 'VETERANS' ARNOLD PALMER AND GARY PLAYER IN THE SENIOR 
SKINS, THE GROUP WILL HAVE 130 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.

When the Lakers' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was given those well-deserved accolades 
last season, it was in part because he had been a pro for more than 20 years. 
But that's just a start for some golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Senior PGA Tour is established and growing, a good player can have 
a career of 40 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The four golfers -- Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Gary Player 
-- who will compete in the $450,000 Senior Skins Game today and Sunday on the 
Mauna Lani Resorts course, have already accumulated 130 years in their 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus and Trevino are just embarking on the senior circuit. Nicklaus became 
eligible to join the 50-and-older set on Jan. 21. Trevino played in the last 
senior event of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and Player are each approaching 40 years as pros and show no signs of 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, they have won almost $14 million in PGA events alone. They have 
accounted for more than 200 victories, including 53 majors. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the third Senior Skins Game, a made-for-television show that 
caught on immediately. Chi Chi Rodriguez, who earned the most money in the 
first two events, was not included in the foursome. "I'm unbeaten and 
uninvited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the format for this event, a golfer has to win a hole outright to collect a 
skin. If two or more tie, the money carries over to the next hole. The first 
six holes are each worth $15,000, the next six $25,000 and the last six 
$35,000. 
</P>
<P>
The foursome will play nine holes today and nine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer has long been known as "the King," but here they are all treated 
royally. Each has a large, separate bungalow with its own pool and spa. And 
they will be playing on a course with a color scheme that blends lush greenery 
with black volcanic rock. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino is eager to play with the seniors. Nicklaus, who is not sure, admits he 
knows almost nothing about the tour. "I don't even know if they practice," he 
said, "so I brought some range balls." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, a 10-year veteran of the senior circuit, understands Nicklaus' 
misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's traumatic to turn 50," Palmer said. "You still think you can win on the 
regular tour. It's a shock to go on the senior tour. I know what he's going 
through. But the more he sees a Robert Gamez and other 21-year-olds, the better 
our tour will look. I don't know whether Jack will play one or 10 tournaments, 
but he's a competitor. Within a year or two he'll be eager, too." 
</P>
<P>
Player, who predicted four years ago that the senior tour would someday become 
the biggest, welcomed the "rookies." He said both Trevino and Nicklaus owed 
something to the game, and this was a way to pay it back. 
</P>
<P>
"Trevino will be a great asset," Player said. "He is colorful and a great 
golfer, too. Jack will learn this is not an old man's tour. You have to shoot 
three 67s to win most of the time. That's not a cinch for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Big Island is mostly arid. Rainfall averages only seven inches a year, but 
the season's quota has been reached in the last two weeks. It has made the 
course green, but also soft. 
</P>
<P>
For Friday's pro-am, it was clear and warm. Nicklaus began his senior career 
with a birdie on a par-five hole.

NHL SUSPENDS DEVILS' SHANAHAN FOR HIGH-STICKING NORDIQUES' PETIT

New Jersey forward Brendan Shanahan has been suspended for five games because 
of a high-sticking incident with Quebec defenseman Michel Petit, the NHL said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"In considering this incident, it is acknowledged that Shanahan did not strike 
Petit out of retaliation for an earlier incident involving the two players," 
said Brian O'Neill, the league's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it is clear that he used his stick in a very reckless manner when he 
was checking his opponent, and this resulted in a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the full responsibility of the stick is that of the player." 
</P>
<P>
During the incident in a Jan. 13 game, Shanahan's stick opened a cut on Petit's 
face that required stitches. Petit had also opened a cut in Shanahan's mouth 
with his stick. He was not disciplined by the league. 
</P>
<P>
Both players received game-misconduct penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils said they will not appeal. Under NHL rules, Shanahan will be allowed 
to play against Toronto, the New York Islanders and the Kings before the 
suspension takes effect on Feb. 2. He will be eligible to return on Feb. 16 
against the New York Rangers.

<P>
STUTE HOPING HISTORY WILL REPEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to his best instincts, trainer Mel Stute has tapped into the same 
source that produced his 1986 champion, Brave Raj, in hopes of landing another 
top filly. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven for Bid, whose roan coat will make her easy to spot coming down the 
seven-furlong chute in today's Santa Ynez Stakes at Santa Anita, began her 
career last fall in New Jersey with Ben Perkins, the same trainer who sold 
Brave Raj to Stute and his patron, Dolly Green, in the summer of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For her $300,000, Green got a Breeders' Cup winner and an Eclipse Award 
champion. Brave Raj earned $933,650 in 1986, the most money ever won by a 
2-year-old of either sex at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place," Stute said in 
reference to his latest Perkins purchase. "That's why I always worry about 
going back for seconds when the first time around worked out so well. But this 
filly could be the exception." 
</P>
<P>
Acting for owner Jerry Moss, Stute flew to the Meadowlands last November, 
inspected Heaven for Bid from head to toe, and put his seal of approval on the 
deal. The filly was in California eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
In her first local appearance on Jan. 4, Heaven for Bid battled heavily favored 
Forest Fealty from the half-mile pole to the wire in a display of uncommon 
tenacity for such an inexperienced filly. Heaven for Bid won by a head while 
running six furlongs in 1:09 1/5. She also dumped jockey Gary Boulanger while 
pulling up after the race. 
</P>
<P>
"She can be a little nasty when she's on the track," Stute said. "She has a 
habit of wheeling like that. After she'd done it a couple of times in the 
morning, we called Perkins and asked if she'd done it for him. He said yes." 
</P>
<P>
By now, Stute is fairly certain there were no other instructions Perkins forgot 
to include in the package. Stute already was aware that her sire, Spectacular 
Bid, the 1980 horse of the year, has been a relative disappointment as a 
stallion, boasting only a handful of major stakes winners among his nearly 200 
sons and daughters who have raced. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always found that hard to believe, because Spectacular Bid impressed me 
as a tremendous racehorse," Stute said. "Maybe that's one of the reasons I like 
this filly -- I keep thinking her sire is due to come up with a real good one." 
</P>
<P>
Stute could use a little spark in his barn these days. After being in the 
spotlight for most of the 1980s with Brave Raj, champion colt Snow Chief, 
Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Very Subtle and a host of other stakes horses, the 
chain-smoking Hoosier has fallen on quiet times. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last stakes winner?" Stute wondered aloud. "Pomona, I think. But right now 
I'm down to the lowest number of horses I've had in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my clients are older gentlemen," Stute went on. "Some of them are not 
in good health, and others are cutting back on their horses. Then when you hit 
a cold streak, people tend to forget about you." 
</P>
<P>
While Heaven for Bid could get 1990 off to a good start, Stute is reserving his 
highest hopes for the proven filly, Kool Arrival. Now a 4-year-old, the 
daughter of Relaunch is on the comeback trail after an eventful 1989 campaign 
both on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Kool Arrival won five of 10 starts last year, including the Las Virgenes Stakes 
at Santa Anita and the Rancho Bernardo Handicap at Del Mar. On Oct. 10, she 
went through a sales ring at Del Mar, and on Oct. 11, she made her final start 
of the season, finishing last in the Autumn Days Handicap at Santa Anita. Stute 
immediately prescribed a long rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me that I was running my best horses all wrong," the trainer 
said. "The horses that seem to get all the attention anymore are the ones that 
win at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced Kool Arrival can be the best mare in the country this year. 
That's why you won't be seeing her until this spring and summer, with an eye on 
the big races in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the 1989 horse of the year, trainer of the year and jockey of 
the year will be revealed today at about 2 p.m. in the Club Court at the east 
end of the Santa Anita clubhouse. Jim McKay will be the host for the 
proceedings, which will be televised as part of ABC's "Wide World of Sports." 
</P>
<P>
Fans at the track will be able to watch the ceremony on the in-house 
closed-circuit system, according to Santa Anita officials. Elsewhere on the 
West Coast, the eight minutes of envelope-opening and video clips can be seen 
during the program's regular time period, from 4:30 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham is favored to win his third Eclipse Award as the nation's 
top trainer, but don't think for a minute he lost any sleep Friday night 
worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know better than to get all worked up," Whittingham said earlier this week. 
"Look what's happened before. In '73, Lucien Laurin won the Triple Crown with 
Secretariat, and they gave the trainer award to Allen Jerkens. When Billy 
Turner won the Triple Crown with Seattle Slew, they gave it to Laz (Barrera). 
</P>
<P>
"And just a couple of years ago, when I won the Breeders' Cup Classic and 
horse-of-the-year (honors) with Ferdinand, they gave it to (Wayne) Lukas." 
</P>
<P>
The only other viable candidate for the trainer award this time is Lukas, whose 
national stable led the country for the seventh straight year and included 
champions Open Mind and Steinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Whittingham will be on hand to accept congratulations from McKay 
for training Sunday Silence and also owning 25% of the obvious choice for horse 
of the year. Kent Desormeaux, who won a record 597 races in 1989, is a virtual 
lock as the top jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye missed his mounts again Friday while recovering from being 
kicked in the leg by a horse last Tuesday. "It was a puncture wound, and some 
infection set in," Terry Lipham, Delahoussaye's agent, said. Delahoussaye is 
scheduled to return today. . . . Quiet American, among the top candidates for 
the $500,000 Strub Stakes on Feb. 4, worked a mile on the main track at 
Hollywood Park Thursday morning in 1:40 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 34 horses have been nominated to the Legend's Last Ride, Bill 
Shoemaker's final race, next Saturday at Santa Anita. Among the eligibles are 
Steinlen, Patchy Groundfog, Royal Touch, Oraibi and Miswaki Tern. . . . Lively 
One and Present Value head a field of eight older horses going in the $163,800 
San Pasqual Handicap Sunday. Also in the field are Candi's Gold, Attesa, 
Avenging Force, Raise a Stanza, Criminal Type and Stylish Winner, who finished 
third in the same race last year.

The accident occurred in the fourth race when Jeffrey Righter, riding Styloid, 
tried to move outside of Ruth's Babe on the far turn of the one-mile track, 
spokesman Vic Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the horses clipped heels, and Styloid fell. Three other horses that 
were bunched behind also fell.

FOX CHAIRMAN WILL CHALLENGE FCC ON SYNDICATION RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that the television networks hope will cause a major split in the 
foundations of the Hollywood production community, Fox Inc. Chairman Barry 
Diller announced Friday his long-expected intention to challenge the federal 
restrictions on networks' ownership of programming and syndication of reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said he will file a petition with the Federal Communications Commission 
on Tuesday asking that the federal government consider relaxing for all 
networks the so-called financial interest and syndication rules, which bar them 
from sharing in the more than $1-billion market for reselling old network 
programs as reruns. The rules also preclude the networks from having a 
financial interest in the programs they commission from outside production 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Those rules, instituted 20 years ago, have played a key role in the development 
of the syndication business and the rise of independent TV producers. (A 
consent decree, set to expire in November, further limits the big networks' 
ability to produce programming.) The networks and Hollywood studios have been 
in discussions to reach a new compromise on the FCC rules. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking ranks with the studios, Diller is now arguing that the rules are 
outmoded. They were designed in 1970 to limit the networks' influence, but now, 
he contends, they would inhibit the growth of the networks' first real 
competitor, Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC defines an entity that distributes 15 hours of programs a week to be a 
network and thus bars it from syndication. Fox, which is heavily involved in 
syndication and owns its own studio, currently airs 7 1/2 hours (three nights 
of prime time). 
</P>
<P>
But it recently announced plans to move to five nights of prime-time 
programming next fall, plus childrens shows and perhaps professional sports, 
which would make it a network. 
</P>
<P>
To keep on schedule with those plans, indeed, Fox is also asking for an 
immediate exemption to the syndication rules. If it wants to make that fall 
expansion, Fox Senior Vice President Preston Padden argued that it must have 
the waiver by May to start selling fall advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Those rules were instituted "when words like VCR and cable TV didn't exist," 
Diller argued in an interview. "If you tell me the status quo must be 
maintained, I'll tell you you're an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
Yet that is precisely what Diller's own trade organization, the powerful Motion 
Picture Assn. of America, is arguing. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that hasn't changed is the potential for excessive abuse by the 
networks," said Jack Valenti, president of the association. "They are the only 
one that can keep you on the air in prime time or keep you off. If this rule 
(restricting network ownership of programs) is abolished or radically revised, 
every independent programmer in the country will be vulnerable" to the 
networks' demanding excessive shares of program ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire production community, large and small, all independent stations and 
consumer groups, are all opposed to opening this (syndication) rule," Valenti 
said. "It is one of the few rules that stands between competition and the total 
dominion by the networks." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Valenti suggested that if the FCC wants to help Fox continue to build 
its fourth network, it re-examine the definition of what constitutes a network. 
</P>
<P>
The networks in turn are hoping that this split between Diller, one of 
Hollywood's most important figures, and much of the rest of the community will 
be the leverage they need to abolish the syndication rule. 
</P>
<P>
"For a member of the Motion Picture Assn. and the Hollywood production 
community to call for modification in this rule represents a landmark 
development in U.S. communication policy," said Rick Cotton, executive vice 
president and general counsel at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the networks want the rule repealed, they don't want the upstart Fox 
to be granted a special exemption either, not unless it is granted to all of 
the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see why a vibrant company that is doing well and is the third-largest 
communications company in the world should be given special status," said 
Martin Franks, vice president for CBS in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In their lobbying effort, the networks will also note that Fox is part of 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which is an Australian, not an American, company. 
(Murdoch, who controls News Corp., became an American citizen in order to 
purchase a group of television stations.) 
</P>

"If they are going to get a waiver while that review process goes on, the three 
American networks should get a waiver while that goes on," Franks said. "The 
notion that they are a new struggling venture is absurd."

ENERGY: OIL GIANTS HAVE TAKEN A BEATING ON THE OFFSHORE PROJECT. THEY BLAME AN 
EXCESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM. ACTIVISTS WORRY ABOUT AN ALASKA-STYLE OIL 
SPILL.

<P>
On the same day Exxon Corp. took a writeoff of $500 million for costs to clean 
up oil spilled in the ocean, Chevron Corp. took a writeoff almost as large for 
its costs of leaving oil underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron said it would take the third and largest charge so far in 1989 related 
to investment in the $2-billion Point Arguello project, an unsuccessful 
10-year-old effort by a consortium of 18 oil companies to produce oil off the 
coast of Santa Barbara. The project has become a symbol -- in the industry's 
view -- of the costs of environmental activism and regulatory intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based energy giant followed Texaco Inc. and Phillips 
Petroleum Co., which reported smaller charges on their investments in the 
project, which sits idle despite completion two years ago because of continuing 
regulatory wrangling in the wake of the Alaskan oil spill. The partners are 
paying out $100,000 a day in operating, salary and maintenance expenses, 
Chevron said. 
</P>
<P>
The writedowns are a final admission that "in the present business climate . . 
. the project is not worth the investment made," according to a Phillips 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron blamed an "irrational" regulatory process under which the project has 
jumped through the hoops of 44 separate agencies and paid more than $100 
million in environmental mitigation measures with no prospect of immediate 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding industry arguments, however, blame for the project's financial 
problems may also lie with the overly optimistic projections of the oil 
companies that came together more than a decade ago to develop an immense oil 
field whose reserves are estimated at possibly 300 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the project was conceived in 1979, oil was in short supply and 
selling for about $35 a barrel. By 1990, companies were projecting prices as 
high as $85 a barrel -- about four times their current prices. The project was 
planned with such prices in mind; executives now admit that they would have 
vetoed the project had they foreseen prices around $22 a barrel, where they are 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to spread the blame around, the oil industry blew millions of 
dollars based on assumptions that oil prices would be a lot higher," said 
Rosario Ilacqua, an industry analyst with Nikko Securities Co. in New York. "I 
think the economic decision was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Said one Texaco executive, who asked not to be identified: "I think at the 
time, it was the right thing to do. . . . The mind-set of the nation was to get 
away from Arab oil and everyone was gung-ho about domestic reserves. . . . But 
things change, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one faults the oil companies for the delays that have drawn the 
project out longer than anyone could have reasonably expected. "The 
environmental pressures tightened up directly in response to the Exxon Valdez 
incident, and who the hell could have predicted that?" asked William Randol, an 
industry analyst with First Boston Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The writedowns reported this month: 
</P>
<P>
* Chevron, the lead partner in the consortium, took the largest writedown on 
its investment in Point Arguello, reporting Wednesday a fourth-quarter charge 
of $445 million. The writedown reflects only part of Chevron's estimated 
$800-million investment in Point Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
* Phillips Petroleum Co. said Jan. 17 that it would write down an estimated 
$280 million after taxes on its offshore California investments, including 
Point Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
* Texaco Inc. said Jan. 18 that it would take a $164-million charge against its 
exploration and production earnings for environmental costs and reduction in 
the value of its investments. That charge included about $60-million in 
after-tax writedowns for Texaco's investment in Point Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
* Pennzoil Co. will report its earnings next week, but would not say whether it 
will take a charge on its investment. Two years ago, Pennzoil took a 
$225-million charge before taxes partly on investments in non-producing 
properties including Point Arguello, said spokesman Bob Harper. 
</P>
<P>
* Of the project's other major partners, neither Atlantic Richfield Co. nor 
Oryx Energy Co. took writedowns on Point Arguello in 1989. Arco's main interest 
is in the project's onshore facilities. Oryx, formerly Sun Oil, has a 
relatively small investment in offshore production. Neither was hurt by the 
delays as much as the larger partners. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron and its partners paid more than $500 million in 1979 for the rights to 
the Point Arguello offshore leases -- the most ever recorded for such rights. 
</P>
<P>
Oil was discovered in 1981, and the consortium of oil companies invested more 
than $2 billion to build three platforms -- Hidalgo, Hermosa and Harvest -- as 
well as oil and gas pipelines, onshore treatment plants and a marine terminal. 
The project was designed to process 100,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic 
feet of gas a day. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, the last hurdle to full production was apparently removed when 
Santa Barbara County issued a permit to allow tankering of oil from the 
terminal at Gaviota to refineries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, the Santa Barbara 
League of Women Voters and a local citizens group, Get Oil Out, appealed the 
permit to the California Coastal Commission, which in August revoked 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
"Alaska showed us that our oil spill cleanup plan here was inadequate," said 
Carole Ann Cole, a spokeswoman for Get Oil Out, who also invoked the memory of 
the devastating platform blowout in the Santa Barbara Channel that fouled 
beaches with oil in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Chevron sued the Coastal Commission and reapplied for a tankering 
permit. The county commissioned a study of the relative costs of shipping oil 
by pipeline, which found that pipeline transportation would cost much more than 
tankering; the county has now ordered a new environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is increasingly unlikely that the project will begin production 
before 1991, said Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the delays and virtually no chance of net income from the project, the 
oil companies continue to push for eventual production, hoping to realize at 
least some cash flow to cover their initial investments. "Obviously, most of 
our costs are sunk and the money's been spent," said the Texaco executive. 
</P>
<P>
POINT ARGUELLO LEASES 
</P>
<P>
Interest in Point Arguello offshore leases: 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa: Chevron 40%, Phillips 40%, Union Pacific Resources 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Hidalgo: Chevron 50%, Phillips 50% 
</P>
<P>
Harvest: Texaco 35%, Pennzoil 25%, Oryx 20%, others 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Project partners with no interest in offshore leases include Arco, through its 
pipeline subsidiary, and Unocal.

NEW ZEALAND WASN'T UNFAIR ONE IN CUP RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have to comment on R.C. McDougall's letter (Jan. 20) regarding the America's 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. McDougall has, in my opinion, a strange (though not uncommon) sense of what 
is "fair" and "unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner chose to race a catamaran rather than one of hundreds of 
monohulled yachts available in San Diego Harbor because, great sportsman that 
he is, he knew he would have an insurmountable edge over New Zealand's 
monohull. This is typical Conner maneuvering. Conner raised all kinds of 
protests over New Zealand's fiberglass hull during the last Cup competition 
until he found out he could beat the boat, and then all was forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
As for "all those men so anxious to help New Zealand," among those men are 
names such as Bus Mosbacher, Ted Turner and other world class helmsmen who look 
upon the America's Cup as a fair sailing contest between similar yachts, a 
viewpoint that Dennis Conner obviously doesn't share.

Moody's Downgrades RJR Junk Bonds: RJR Nabisco Inc.'s junk bonds, previously a 
stalwart in the volatile high-yield debt market, fell sharply after Moody's 
Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating on $19.5 billion of debt issued by 
RJR and its units. 
</P>
<P>
It cited uncertainty about the company's ability to repay huge debts incurred 
when the company was taken private in the biggest leveraged buyout in history. 
One type of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s senior debentures were lowered to B-3 
from B-2. Analysts said some of RJR Nabisco's junk bonds fell 10% in value.

Texas Instruments: The Dallas semiconductor and computer company said net 
income in 1989 totaled $292 million, down 20% from 1988. Revenue totaled $6.5 
billion, up 1%. The company blamed a reduced semiconductor market, a slowdown 
in the defense industry and lower prices for dynamic random access memory chips 
and bipolar logic products.

PERSONAL FINANCE: THOSE INVISIBLE RISKS IN SOME 401(K) PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're one of the growing number of workers with a 401(k) company savings 
plan, take note: Some of your money may not be as secure as you think. 
</P>
<P>
Many participants in the popular 401(k) plans choose to place most of their 
money in fixed-income investments, putting less money in stock funds. If you 
choose the fixed-income route, chances are that your money will be put into 
so-called guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs. 
</P>
<P>
GICs are like bank certificates of deposit, promising a certain return -- often 
0.5 to 1.5 percentage points above yields on money market mutual funds -- for a 
fixed period, usually one to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of every dollar in 401(k) plans -- about $90 billion -- is in 
GICs. Another $60 billion is in GICs through profit-sharing plans or other 
pension plans. And the amount is growing fast. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the "guarantee" in GICs is not complete. It's limited to 
the return that you are promised, not the safety of your principal. The 
contracts are offered by insurance companies, which invest the money in 
mortgages, privately placed loans and other investments that pay higher returns 
than Treasury securities. The U.S. government does not back these contracts the 
way it backs federally insured bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, your money is only as safe as the financial strength of the insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"They are low risk, but they are not risk-less," says William D. Templeton, 
director of insurance consulting at TPF&amp;C, an employee-benefits consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
While there has never been a GIC default and no one has ever lost a penny in 
one, most employees have not been told of the potential risk. While most 
insurance companies offering GICs are big, reputable firms that invest 
conservatively and are given the highest financial ratings, some -- such as 
troubled First Executive Corp. of Los Angeles -- have invested at least a 
portion of their GIC funds in such high-risk investments as junk bonds and 
commercial real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
California is one of a handful of states without a guarantee fund that would 
reimburse at least part of your money in the event of an insurance company 
default. So a default could mean you'll be out most or all of your money. 
</P>
<P>
There's also another risk: If your employer went under or engaged in a 
large-scale layoff, you might get back only the market value of your funds in a 
GIC, not their original value. If interest rates in the economy have risen, the 
market value will be less than the original value. 
</P>
<P>
Should you avoid GICs? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. GICs are still safer than stocks. And you probably won't have 
a choice of a safer investment anyway. As an alternative, a growing number of 
employers are using so-called bank investment contracts (BICs). But it's not 
entirely clear whether federal deposit insurance would fully apply in a BIC 
default. And many banks -- laden with risky foreign and real estate loans -- 
are in worse shape than insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers offer money market funds as a 401(k) investment option, but it's 
not easy switching into them from a GIC. 
</P>
<P>
To discourage frequent switching, employers generally require you to transfer 
your money first into an equity fund for at least three months, Templeton says. 
</P>
<P>
If it will help you sleep easier, check on the Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's 
or Best's rating of the insurer or insurers offering your GICs. You can get 
that from your employee-benefits counselor or a good public library. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask what the average quality of the portfolio is and what its expected 
performance patterns are going to be," suggests Kenneth L. Walker, president of 
T. Rowe Price Guaranteed Asset Advisers, a firm that manages GIC accounts.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES DIFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our adjustable mortgage payment has recently been increased due to 
rising interest rates. But despite our higher monthly payment, the amount that 
is actually allocated to the repayment of our loan principal has decreased. Is 
this common with adjustable mortgages? -- M. A. A. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: It can be; it all depends on the type of adjustable-rate mortgage you 
have and the conditions governing it. According to our advisers, some 
adjustable-rate mortgages limit the amount that monthly charges can be raised. 
So if interest rates rise steeply, it is possible that the required increase in 
your monthly payment would be greater than your mortgage agreement allows. 
</P>
<P>
What happens? Your lender gets the money -- or at least some of it -- but it's 
shifted from the principal repayment portion of the monthly payment to the 
interest side. In an extreme case of rising interest rates and an 
adjustable-rate mortgage with a ceiling on allowable increases, you could end 
up with a large balloon payment or payments in the final years of the mortgage 
to catch up with the principal repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Even more dramatic would be "negative amortization." Here, instead of paying 
off some of the principal each month -- even a slight amount -- you actually 
end up owing a greater amount because your monthly payments do not cover the 
full costs of the interest charges accrued by your loan. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line? Read the terms of your loan carefully to see what you sign and 
how the loan will be administered over its full life. Even though you may think 
you will sell your house well before the 30-year mortgage runs its full course, 
you can never be sure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRS Allows Discount on Family Rentals 
</P>
<P>
Q: We wish to rent a house to our son for an amount less than what we are 
currently receiving for this unit. However, our tax consultant says we will be 
taxed as though we had received the amount we had previously gotten. Is this 
true, or can we charge our son a reasonable rental price based on the fact that 
the house is next door to ours and that our son will eventually be required to 
care of us as we become older? -- N. C. F. 
</P>
<P>
A: Relax, say our advisers. You may rent the house to your son at a discount so 
long as the rent you do charge is "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
What does that mean? Well, our advisers say the Internal Revenue Service 
scrutinizes such deals carefully. A 20% discount below prevailing rental rates 
is generally considered reasonable. Above that, they say, and you court 
questions, although you can't be sure that the IRS would challenge an 
arrangement with a discount greater than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the IRS accept a discount for rentals to family members at all? It's a 
good question. Our advisers say it is generally accepted that renting to a 
family member poses less risk than renting to a total stranger, a factor that 
takes some of the uncertainity out of being a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do Homework Before Investing Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me if interest earned from a foreign bank account is taxable? I 
know it has to be reported, but I'm not sure if it's taxable each year or if 
it's taxable only when it is withdrawn. -- A. G. 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are a resident of the United States, the interest is probably 
taxable, whether or not you actually withdraw the money. However, this subject 
is quite complicated and fraught with ambiguity, intrigue and intense interest 
by the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The actual application of U.S. tax laws on this interest depends on where your 
foreign bank account is located and the exact terms of the treaties between the 
U.S. and the foreign country. Offshore bank accounts are a well-known tax 
dodge, and the IRS is aware of them. You would be advised to research 
applicable agreements thoroughly before making any offshore deposits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Point on IRA Withdrawals 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 68 years old and plan to retire soon. My individual retirement account 
now allows me to reinvest any capital gains and dividends in additional shares 
of stock. But what if I should direct that these distributions be paid directly 
to me, rather than reinvested in new shares? Would the payments I receive be 
treated as withdrawals from the account? -- H. F. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, the Internal Revenue Service considers such payments account 
withdrawals. And as such, they are subject to taxation. However, because you 
are already over age 59 1/2 -- the minimum age at which withdrawals from 
individual retirement accounts can be made -- no early withdrawal penalty is 
assessed. 
</P>
<P>
If you had not yet reached age 59 1/2, these distributions would be subject to 
taxation as well as a 10% penalty for early withdrawal from your individual 
retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Expenses Can't Be Deducted 
</P>
<P>
Q: I rent out my house at the beach during the summer. During these months, I 
have to rent an apartment in which to live. Because my home mortgage is fully 
paid, I have no monthly housing expenses during the year except the rent I pay 
on the apartment during the summer. May I deduct my apartment rent as a 
business expense to offset some of the income I receive from renting my beach 
house out? -- A. M. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The Internal Revenue Service does not allow taxpayers to deduct personal 
expenses as a business cost. It's just that simple.

COURT ORDERS ANAHEIM TO HALT ON ARENA 
</P>

<P>
Plans to build an $85-million indoor sports arena in Anaheim were halted -- at 
least temporarily -- Friday when an Orange County Superior Court commissioner 
ordered the city to take no more "steps in furtherence" of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk stayed arena plans until Feb. 14, when another 
hearing can be held on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said the action is likely to delay construction to 
the point that the arena will not be ready for the opening of the professional 
basketball season in the fall of 1991 and could possibly jeopardize efforts to 
lure an NBA franchise to town. 
</P>
<P>
But Hunter said he is still confident Anaheim will be able to build its arena 
before a nearly identical one, proposed in Santa Ana, is under way. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time Santa Ana reaches our point, it's going to have just as many 
problems," Hunter predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, however, said his city is moving ahead at a 
deliberate pace, "dotting all the i's and crossing all the Ts. We're going to 
take our time and do it right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"One of the two sites is eventually going to have the arena, and that's 
something to cheer about," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit heard in court Friday was filed by Jack Stanaland, owner of Orange 
Tree Mobile Home Park, which is immediately next to Anaheim's proposed arena 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was one of three filed Friday against Anaheim. The others were filed 
by the Los Angeles Rams and Anaheim Stadium Associates (ASA), a development 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the suits claims the city hastily approved its arena project without 
proper regard for its environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city said they were uncertain what effect Cimbaluk's order 
will have on escrows that have not yet closed on property being acquired for 
the arena or what effect there will be on negotiations with the arena 
developer, Ogden Projects Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"This does more than just affect the city's ability to construct on the site," 
said attorney John L. Fellows III, who represented the city at Friday's 
hearing. "We thought the law was on our side and we still think it is." 
</P>
<P>
City officials had hoped to begin construction in February and to open the 
20,000-seat arena by October, 1991. But in papers filed in response to the 
mobile home park lawsuit, Assistant City Manager James Ruth said that clearing 
and grading of the 26-acre arena site cannot begin at least until April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland's suit seeks to prevent the city from spending money, "consummating 
agreements to acquire property . . . acquiring property," and clearing the site 
and building an arena. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland's attorney, Robert S. Coldren, said the city "intends to commence 
construction in February and . . . is on the verge of consummating 
land-acquisition transactions which would irretrievably commit the city to the 
arena project." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and ASA, a partnership that includes Rams' owner Georgia Frontiere, 
have similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"If we prevail, then if the city wants to continue with the project, they would 
probably have to start over," Rams' attorney Peter N. Scolney said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have charged that the city rushed its approval of the project in 
order to begin construction before ground is broken for the nearly identical 
arena in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland has complained that the arena would create noise, traffic and unsafe 
conditions for his 400 tenants. The arena would be located next to the mobile 
home park on Douglass Road, north of Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are concerned with the proposed use of Anaheim Stadium's parking lot 
for arena parking and the scheduling of arena events at the same time as Rams' 
games. ASA has complained that the environmental impact report on the arena was 
based on outdated and inadequate information and was adopted by the city 
without giving the public adequate time to review the issue. ASA has been 
granted development rights to Anaheim Stadium's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland, the Rams and ASA seek court orders to set aside the approval of the 
arena environmental impact report, rezoning and parking lot permit. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with threats of lawsuits, the Anaheim City Council on Tuesday postponed 
for two weeks acting on a request by the California Angels, Los Angeles Rams, 
Orange Tree Mobile Home Park and ASA to set aside the Dec. 27 approval of the 
environmental report, zone change and parking lot permit. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and other councilmen said they need more time to analyze the numerous 
issues raised by the arena critics. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams and others were facing a deadline. State law requires court 
challenges to environmental impact reports to be filed within 30 days of the 
document's adoption, which runs out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
California Angels attorney Don Morrow said the baseball club hopes its 
complaints about the arena can be worked out without lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow said the city may extend the deadline for filing a lawsuit in order to 
continue negotiations with the Angels. The team wants assurances that there 
will be no events scheduled to begin at the new arena within an hour of the 
start of Angels' games a block away at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're prepared to go to court if we don't get this worked out," Morrow 
said. "To protect our fans, I think we'd have to do that." Hunter has said that 
even though he believes the city would prevail in court, the delay would set 
back construction about six months, long enough to miss the opening of the 
1991-92 basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irv Pickler, the lone City Council opponent of the project, has 
charged that in the city's rush to acquire land for the arena, Anaheim 
officials have paid more for the property than its appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pickler said, he believes Anaheim has approved too much money -- more 
than $21 million to date -- to acquire land for a facility that may never house 
a professional sports team.

MEXICANS SAY BAJA MURDER CASE SOLVED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SLAIN NEWPORT BEACH BUSINESSMAN IS CLEARED BY 
POLICE, WHO SAID THAT TWO MEN HAVE CONFESSED TO THE 1988 ROBBERY-KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican police announced this week that they have solved the bizarre mystery of 
who killed the flamboyant Claude L. Falkenstien. They say two robbers confessed 
to shooting the Newport Beach businessman while his girlfriend crouched in the 
kitchen of his Baja California seaside home. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Mexican police had suspected that Falkenstien's girlfriend, Patricia 
Engels, was somehow involved in the shooting on the night of Nov. 6, 1988. 
Engels told police that a robber shot Falkenstien and fled with valuables, but 
investigators began doubting her story when the goods turned up a few days 
later in the trunk of a neighbor's car. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Engels returned to the United States and refused to submit to 
further questioning by Mexican police. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absurd that they accused her," said Malcolm Mike Guleserian, 
Falkenstien's lawyer and close friend of 10 years. "It was terrible. She 
watched him die and then was accused of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bethany Falkenstien, one of the dead man's three former wives, "Oh my 
God, after all this time -- it's unbelievable. . . . It's a relief. He was my 
best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact Engels through her parents and friends were unsuccessful on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two men who allegedly confessed to murdering the 58-year-old Falkenstien were 
identified as Sergio Gomez Ramirez, 39, who is jailed in Guadalajara on another 
crime, and Rodrigo Corona Lopez, 33, of Guadalajara, who was arrested this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
While being interrogated by prison officials, Gomez allegedly said he and 
Corona killed Falkenstien during a bungled robbery at the businessman's leased 
home in Playa La Mision, about 20 miles south of Rosarito, according to Genaro 
Valle Lopez, chief of the Mexican state judicial police in Rosarito. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez "told us how Falkenstien was dressed, where his girlfriend was -- and 
everything matched what the girlfriend told us," Valle said. "They are the ones 
who are to blame, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Mexican police believed Engels' account. Engels told officers that 
she was in the kitchen preparing dinner when two robbers burst into the house, 
shot Falkenstien and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Engels said she had reached for a pistol hidden under a dresser and fired shots 
in the air outdoors to scare the robbers away and signal for help. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, police held Engels and some neighbors for questioning, then 
released them. Engels returned to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But as the investigation proceeded, odd details surfaced. Co-workers at 
Falkenstien's Newport Beach ad company, Mass Media Marketing, said he had 
introduced Engels, 38, not as his girlfriend but as his daughter. The neighbors 
who owned the car in which Falkenstien's valuables were found turned out to be 
wanted by police on suspicion of stealing $20,000 worth of birds in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And Falkenstien, a Balboa Bay Club member who was fond of heavy gold jewelry 
and spent nearly every weekend in Baja, turned out to have owned a business 
that was more than $180,000 in debt at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican police also learned of a $120,000 life insurance policy that was to be 
split between Engels and Delores Falkenstien, the dead man's first wife and 
executor of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
It was suspicion that Engels had not told the truth about the theft of 
Falkenstien's wallet, briefcase and jewelry that primarilay led investigators 
to believe that she knew something more about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did she do that?" Valle wondered. "Maybe to justify that an assault really 
happened? Maybe she was just scared we wouldn't believe her." 
</P>
<P>
Valle said Gomez and Corona have also confessed to committing a string of Playa 
La Mision house robberies in the weeks before Falkenstien's death. 
</P>
<P>
Valle said Mexican police are publicizing the closing of the Falkenstien case 
in the hope that Engels will return to Mexico to identify Corona and Gomez, if 
they were the intruders who killed Falkenstien. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution of Gomez and Corona will proceed with or without Engels' 
help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez will finish serving a sentence for robbery and assault before being 
sentenced on his apparent confession in Falkenstien's death, Valle said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona, who is held in Rosarito, will be sentenced within the next month, Valle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that each man will spend at least 30 years in prison for 
Falkenstien's death.

FATHER TAKES BLAME FOR FATAL SHOOTING BY SON; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JUDGE RECEIVES PLEA FOR MERCY IN THE CASE OF A 12-YEAR-OLD CHARGED WITH 
KILLING A SCHOOLMATE. THE BOY'S FATHER SAID THE PISTOL WAS TAKEN FROM HIS 
GARAGE.

The father of a 12-year-old boy charged with shooting a friend to death in 
front of horrified Christmas shoppers at a mall here asked a Juvenile Court 
judge for mercy and accepted the blame for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the one who should be incarcerated and not my son," Juan Manuel Cardenas 
of Orange wrote in Spanish. "Because my error is not having educated him 
properly. Because I never spoke with my son about the dangers of a firearm. . . 
. Because if I had not permitted this firearm to be brought to my house, none 
of this would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas' son is charged in the fatal shooting of Jacalyn Calabrese, 12, at the 
Mall of Orange on Dec. 18. Friends have said the boy had shown a .25-caliber 
pistol to companions from his school, Cerro Villa Junior High, as a form of 
braggadocio. They have said the boy did not mean to kill Jacalyn. 
</P>
<P>
The father said the pistol belongs to his brother, who travels from San 
Francisco to visit his girlfriend in Orange County nearly every weekend. The 
father said he let his brother store the pistol in the garage but told him to 
hide it in a pile of old clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The boy apparently stumbled across the pistol and took it, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
To protect his father, the boy would not at first tell police where he had 
found the pistol, said Deputy Public Defender Chris Hilger, who is representing 
the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy was being a little kid, thinking about his dad," Hilger said. "So he 
didn't say where the gun came from. He didn't want to get his dad in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the father did not volunteer information about the pistol either, 
for fear that it would make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
However, he detailed his feelings in a letter that he gave to Hilger, who 
released a copy Friday after a pretrial hearing was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the father asked the judge who will be hearing his son's case 
for leniency and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor, my son is a good boy who is not lost," Cardenas wrote. "He only 
needs your help to continue being a useful man in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor, you, he who makes the law respectable -- and I respect it. But at 
the moment of judging my son, judge him with a little bit of your heart. We are 
a united family, and it's in your hands alone to return us to be a united 
family, to live eternally grateful." 
</P>
<P>
Hilger said the boy continues to suffer psychologically as he awaits trial in 
Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to block it out and pretend it (shooting) never happened," Hilger 
said. "When I ask him about it, he twitches and scratches his arm. He won't 
answer questions about it. I've stopped asking him about it."

BRIDE HAS TO TESTIFY AT DUFFY HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day before he was to go to court, Joe (Mac) Duffy, a handsome Scot accused 
of bilking more than $100,000 from rich, unsuspecting women around the globe, 
married one of his alleged victims so that Orange County prosecutors couldn't 
force her to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvianne Lestringant, 41, a woman 13 years Duffy's senior who walks with a 
cane, said she loves him and forgives him. On Thursday, in an interview, she 
told of the couple's plans to fly to Las Vegas for a quick marriage, in part so 
she would not have to give testimony that could incriminate Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy, a Newport Beach resident, and Lestringant, his French bride of one 
day, got a rude awakening Friday when a Harbor Municipal Court judge ruled that 
Lestringant had to testify because she is one of her husband's alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
Things went from bad to worse for Duffy, a self-described professional golfer, 
at his pretrial hearing on grand theft charges as a parade of women in their 
late 30s to 50s bitterly recounted how he had conned them out of Rolex watches, 
fancy clothes and thousands of dollars under the pretext of investing their 
money on the European stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting tailored suits and stylish hats, the bejeweled women sat together 
along with nearly a dozen others who say they, too, were victimized but did not 
press charges because of publicity surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was arrested last November on complaints from at least nine women who say 
he stole more than $100,000 from them. At the time of his arrest, he was 
wearing a $1,000 Armani coat, a Movado watch and $800 crocodile shoes. In a 
bizarre twist, Lestringant, one of the women who had pressed charges against 
him, later put up $20,000 bail to keep him out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
Since the investigation began, prosecutors say, they have received dozens of 
phone calls from around the country and Europe from other women who were 
allegedly swindled by Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant testified, however, that her faith is not shaken in her new 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the way the police say he is at all," she said. "He wants to change, 
he wants to pay back the women." 
</P>
<P>
But other victims described Duffy as a slick con man with a variety of methods 
of getting money to support a lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
In the alleged scheme, the women would give Duffy a minimum of $2,000 in 
exchange for a 34% return on their money. None of the women asked for written 
receipts or verified if Duffy was actually a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very charming, he dressed well, he drove fancy cars . . . he had such a 
fortune it didn't seem like he would try to steal from me," said one of the 
women who did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Duffy used the same ruse on a Laguna Hills woman who 
makes her living as a stockbroker. The woman, Sharon Butler, testified that she 
charged a $15,000 Rolex watch for Duffy on a credit card, and gave him another 
$15,000. One installment, a $10,000 check, was apparently used by Duffy to buy 
a 1969 Rolls-Royce, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you're an intelligent woman and something like this could never 
happen to you, but it can," Butler said, adding that Duffy convinced her to buy 
him the watch. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hearing, Duffy sat impassively, dressed nattily in a charcoal 
gray jacket, brown tasseled loafers and black pants. He and Lestringant refused 
to answer questions about their marriage or other aspects of the case. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, Diane Lampe, used her credit card to buy $1,500 worth shoes at a 
department store for Duffy, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Christopher W. Strople ordered Duffy held over for 
trial on three charges of felony grand theft. He also doubled bail to $40,000 
and Duffy was taken back into custody. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is a con man," Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Cafferty told the judge in 
asking for higher bail. "I don't think, if his feet ever hit the streets again, 
that we will see him again." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

'MOUSEORAIL' BACKS MONORAIL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A giant red-and-silver, bullet-shaped car, sporting Mickey Mouse ears, sped 
past parts of Orange County Friday, carrying four mayors who say that a 
proposal for an 18-mile monorail line may be ready by summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the people of Orange County to envision a transit system that's not 
only a Mickey Mouse dream," said county Supervisor Don R. Roth, who declined to 
take a ride on the bullet. "This monorail is going to be a reality." 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Mickey Mouse and serenaded with a jazzed-up version of the Mickey 
Mouse Club theme in Disneyland's parking lot, the mayors from Anaheim, Costa 
Mesa, Orange and Santa Ana were smiling widely before boarding the 
"Mouseorail," a 40-foot-long revamped car that was once part of the amusement 
park's monorail system. For an hour, the mayors played conductors for the media 
by giving a tour of the proposed route as well as an update on how the plan is 
faring. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who is pushing for the regional plan, said a 
proposal for the monorail line would be ready as early as the summer. The 
mayors of Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange, Costa Mesa and Irvine also plan to meet 
in February to organize a joint powers authority committee to spearhead the 
plan, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting mail from all over the county and people are saying, 'Do it now.' 
People want the monorail built because they are tired of traffic," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
And if as on cue, traffic along the 18-mile route frequently halted the 
odd-looking vehicle, leaving commuters gawking at the "Mouseorail." 
</P>
<P>
"Look how bad the traffic is here," said Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter as the 
16-seat vehicle rolled past the Anaheim Convention Center. "It's a mess and 
this is nothing compared to really busy days." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said amusement park officials support the concept 
of the monorail system, which would link Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium to the 
MainPlace shopping mall and the Civic Center in Santa Ana and then continue 
south to the John Wayne Airport and the Irvine Spectrum office complex. The 
line would also connect to a high-speed super-train that is planned to link the 
county and other Southland points to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the monorail will cost almost $1 billion and they hope that it 
will be financed mostly by private firms. LILY ENG

VOTERS TO DECIDE IF COUNCIL GETS A RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in this seaside community will decide in June whether City Council 
members will get their first pay raise in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously earlier this week to ask voters to raise their 
monthly salaries from $125 to as much as $300, despite the fears of at least 
one council member that voters may question the ethics of the move. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked to amend the city's 1964 charter so that council salaries 
conform with those set by the State of California Government Code. The code 
sets standards for cities without charters and calls for those with a 
population of under 35,000 to pay council members up to $300 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joyce Risner, who proposed the ballot measure, said current 
compensation is based on 1964 economics and is insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Risner said she serves the city an average of 20 hours a week, which she says 
comes to about 10 cents per hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure ($125) was pretty good for the early '60s," Risner added. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Seal Beach ranks next to last in council salaries. Villa 
Park, which offers no payment to council officials, is last, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Risner said the $125 payment might also prevent qualified people from becoming 
involved in city government. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people run for City Council for the money. But some people might 
not run because it is not worth their time or effort," she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joe Hunt supported bringing the pay-raise issue to the voters and 
said that if adopted, voters should also decide how much of an increase the 
council should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt added that most residents he has talked with think an increase is fair. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach is divided into five districts, with each represented by one council 
member. Nine candidates have entered the race for the three Seal Beach council 
seats up for grabs in the March 27 election. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Risner nor Mayor Victor S. Grgas will seek reelection under a city law 
that prohibits residents from serving more than two consecutive terms. Eight of 
the nine candidates are seeking those two seats. Hunt is running unopposed.

COUNCILMAN DEBATES HIS PRO-RECALL CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in a brutal nine-month recall campaign, Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis faced his detractors in formal debate. Before about 200 members of a 
local Democratic club on Thursday, Curtis and a representative of the recall 
group, Alliance for Mission Viejo, traded accusations of political 
power-grabbing and dirty politicking. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done throughout the recall movement, Curtis charged a development 
firm, the Mission Viejo Co., with being the real force behind the recall vote, 
which is scheduled for Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is going to control our new city?" Curtis asked the audience, "the 
shareholders of the Philip Morris Co.," which owns the development firm, "or 
you, the voters?" 
</P>
<P>
Alliance spokesman Stuart Jasper said the only force motivating the recall 
group was a desire to unseat Curtis for his attempt to annex the 7,000-resident 
Aegean Hills community in order to expand his political power base. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilman Curtis has had his primary allegiance to Aegean Hills," Jasper 
said. "His residence was there and that was where he sought his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"The fight isn't over the Mission Viejo Company," Jasper added. "The fight is 
over Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
Alliance members say that Curtis continued to press for annexation of Aegean 
Hills, 582 acres of unincorporated land neighboring Mission Viejo, even after 
the City Council withdrew support for the plan in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Jasper said, the councilman supported the annexation during 
an appearance before the Local Agency Formation Commission, an independent body 
that oversees regional boundary issues. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a breach of trust," said Jasper, a Mission Viejo resident who 
practices law in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis denied that he spoke in favor of Aegean Hills at the LAFCO hearing. At 
that meeting, the councilman said he recommended that the city delay re-filing 
an annexation application. The councilman also pointed to a 1988 city-sponsored 
survey that he said showed Mission Viejo residents in favor of the annexation 
by a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this (proposed annexation) is not something that Bob Curtis cooked 
up by himself," he said. "Aegean Hills is a red herring." 
</P>
<P>
Financial disclosure documents have shown that development interests have 
pumped more than $150,000 into the campaign to recall Curtis, of which $57,000 
came from the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear about all these residents against me," said Curtis, "but all I see is 
the same small group of people. All I see is a $150,000 effort to qualify their 
(recall) petition." 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents have denied Curtis' accusations that developers are running 
the campaign. Developers are simply protecting their interests against Curtis, 
a slow-growth advocate, alliance leader Helen Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
And Mission Viejo Co. representatives say that $57,000 would be a small price 
to pay for unseating Curtis. FRANK MESSINA

COMPUTER STORE HOLDUPS MAY BE THE WORK OF RING 
</P>

<P>
Four men suspected of shooting a Santa Ana computer store owner Thursday may be 
part of an organized crime ring responsible for an earlier holdup in Fountain 
Valley and other recent thefts of microchips in Orange County, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Police Lt. Rod Gillman said, however, that investigators 
believe the four suspects, reputed to be members of a Vietnamese gang, were not 
involved in Thursday's robbery of P.H. Computers in Mile Square Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical descriptions (of the Fountain Valley bandits) do not match (with 
those of the four suspects) and other evidence has led investigators to believe 
that the same men were not involved," Gillman said. "But the way the entire 
operation was (executed), we believe that they are connected to the same 
group." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, four armed robbers stormed into P.H. Computers and tied 
up the store's five employees. Store owner Peter Tran said Friday that the 
bandits escaped with $100,000 worth of microchips and computer hardware. 
</P>
<P>
About a half hour after the Fountain Valley robbery, armed bandits entered A.H. 
Computer Co. about two miles away on Warner Avenue in Santa Ana. The bandits 
shot owner Anxuan Huynh, 29, in the thigh when he attempted to resist the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers, who became suspicious when they saw four men enter the store, 
chased the bandits. 
</P>
<P>
Police later arrested Tinh Nguyen, 21, of Santa Ana; Thang Van Nguyen, 20, of 
Anaheim; Be Van Nguyen, 23, of Garden Grove and Tung Phoung Trinh, 20, of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Sgt. Art Echternacht said Friday that the suspects were being held on 
suspicion of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. He said police 
could not release further details because it might jeopardize the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Huynh, who was taken to the Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center after the shooting, was released Thursday night. But A.H. Computer Co., 
near Warner Avenue and Fairview Street, remained closed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The P.H. Computer Co. was open for business. Employees said they were still 
shaken by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Toan Trinh, 29, said four men burst into the store about 12:30 p.m., armed with 
shotguns and carrying walkie-talkies. A bandit pointed a shotgun at owner Peter 
Tran's head while another stuck a yellow sheet of legal paper on the inside of 
the door. On it was scrawled: "Out to lunch. Will be Back at 1:15." 
</P>
<P>
Three other gunmen rounded up the other store employees, ordering them to lie 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Trinh said he had to think quickly. "No (gunman) was covering me . . . and I 
knew if I (made) any move I would be an easy target," Trinh said. "So I put my 
hands on my head and said, 'Please give me orders.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said the gunmen then tied his hands with rope. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers led Trinh, Tran and three other employees into a dark stockroom. 
Trinh said the bandits spoke into walkie-talkies as they hauled boxes of hard 
disks, video adapters, computer chips and other computer hardware through a 
back door and into a van. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "They were saying things like 'What's going on outside?' and 'Get 
closer! Get closer!' " 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the two robberies are linked to at least 12 heists in 
which microchips have been stolen in Orange County and the San Jose area. 
Federal agencies, including the FBI and the U.S. Customs Service, have said 
they are investigating the involvement of Vietnamese gangs in the thefts.

POLICE NARROW SEARCH FOR 10-YEAR-OLD'S ASSAILANT

An appeal for information in the sexual assault of a 10-year-old boy at a high 
school basketball game last week has yielded the names of several suspects, a 
Cypress police investigator said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective William McCullers declined to say whether an arrest is imminent but 
said investigators have solid leads on the assailant's identity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received numerous phone calls from people who believe they have seen 
the guy, and as a result have several names of people we will be talking to," 
McCullers said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 9:10 p.m. Jan. 17 near the end of a basketball game 
that pitted the varsities of Cypress High School and Anaheim's Loara High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The boy had been attending the game with his parents. When it appeared that the 
Loara team would lose, he left his parents and strolled into a hallway near a 
restroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone approached the boy, led him into the restroom and sexually assaulted 
him, McCullers said. The boy described the assailant as a male Latino, 35 to 40 
years old, about 5 feet, 5 inches tall, 160 to 170 pounds, with short, 
straight, dark hair and pimples or freckles. He was wearing a red sweat shirt 
and blue or gray jeans. 
</P>
<P>
McCullers said a ticket taker noticed a man matching the description who had 
been watching the game from outside the gym just moments before the assault. 
</P>
<P>
There are also believed to be witnesses who saw the man and the boy in the 
hallway just before the assault, but they have not come forward, McCullers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, investigators gathered some of the 600 fans from both schools who 
attended the game. But none of the 40 or so people who showed up could remember 
seeing the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Police also distributed at the two high schools an account of the incident and 
a composite drawing of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress High Principal Jack Weber said several students have come forward with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said that the incident has "heightened awareness of the high school staff 
and the entire community" but that no extra precautions are planned at future 
games. Administrators from both schools were on duty at the game as well as two 
male ticket takers.

HOSPITAL READIES GROUP INSURANCE FOR SOUTH COUNTY

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center is gearing up to market a group-insurance 
plan tailor-made for South Orange County's small-business community. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Simmons, director of public relations for the 215-bed Laguna Hills 
hospital, says she knows of no other instance in which a company has marketed a 
group-insurance plan to such a small geographic area, adding: "We are focusing 
on South Orange County from Irvine through San Clemente." 
</P>
<P>
Through what it calls the Saddleback Health Network, the hospital is offering 
an insurance-benefit package that includes its own facility, two urgent-care 
centers and the services of 200 staff physicians who have agreed to provide 
substantial discounts to plan members. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said Saddleback Hospital decided to promote insurance for small 
businesses after surveying the Saddleback Valley and finding 15,000 employers, 
85% of whom have fewer than 10 employees. The smaller businesses included 
mom-and-pop restaurants, manufacturers, boutiques, dry cleaners and flower 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
"These small employers often have been excluded from insurance because of the 
expense," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
John Johnson, vice president of marketing and sales for United Insurance Co. of 
America, the plan's underwriter, said test marketing has shown that small 
employers in the area want a selection of insurance plans that allow employees 
to share the cost to varying degrees. And some wanted an alternative plan for 
employees who do not live near the Saddleback hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Several plans, including a preferred-provider organization and more traditional 
indemnity insurance, are in final design, Johnson said. He added that the plans 
will be ready for a mass-mailing and telephone-marketing blitz scheduled to 
begin in mid-February. Richard Jacobs, president of Voluntary Hospitals of 
America West, said he may recommend a similar health-care plan to the 
association's 15 other member hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

AST FOUNDER REPEATS SCRIPT WITH AMKLY; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONAL COMPUTERS: DOES THE WORLD NEED ANOTHER VENDOR? ALBERT C. WONG MADE A 
FORTUNE THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND LOOKS TO DO IT AGAIN.

Albert C. Wong made a fortune as co-founder of a company that started out 
making accessories for personal computers and later began building the 
computers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the soft-spoken, 41-year-old Wong is using $2 million of that fortune to 
found a company that will start out making accessories for personal computers 
and will later begin building the computers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Wong says the resemblance between his old company, AST Research, and his new 
one, AMKLY Systems of Irvine, is entirely superficial, since the personal 
computer business has changed enormously in the 10 years since AST was formed. 
</P>
<P>
"AST was founded at the right time, a period of explosive growth," Wong said. 
"With AMKLY, we have to be a lot more careful in terms of our planning." 
</P>
<P>
For Wong, careful means focusing on specialized niches. AMKLY's first product 
is a memory expansion device for high-end Compaq personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, won't AMKLY be competing with AST once it launches its own 
computer later this year? "I don't look at it that way," Wong said with a 
slightly mischievous grin. 
</P>
<P>
Wong probably wouldn't mind if his new company stole just a little bit of 
business from his old one. As one of three founding partners at AST, Wong was 
the key design engineer and later oversaw all technical operations for a firm 
that became one of the great success stories of the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
"He was responsible for most of the products that made AST what it is," said 
Stewart Alsop, publisher of the PC Letter in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of AST, however, began to take its toll on the close 
relationship between Wong and the other two partners, Thomas C.K. Yuen and Safi 
U. Qureshey. Wong quit the company abruptedly in November, 1988, stating that 
he and the partners "just didn't get along." He remained on the AST board and 
took advantage of the chance to spend more time with his twin 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Wong said, he decided it was "time to come back to the industry." 
He resigned from the AST board and started up AMKLY. The odd-sounding name is 
composed of the first initials of each of his family members. 
</P>
<P>
After studying the market, he concluded that a circuit board that boosted the 
memory of PCs -- the same type of product that launched AST -- would be the new 
firm's first project. 
</P>
<P>
Wong explained that Compaq computers use a proprietary design for the boards 
that hold the rows of chips that make up a computer's internal memory. Buying 
those boards from Compaq is very expensive. AMKLY will offer Compaq customers 
an industry-standard board layout, enabling them to purchase just the number of 
memory units they want from whomever they want and plug them into the board. 
</P>
<P>
Alsop said Wong's idea is interesting. "It provides a real neat solution for a 
certain group of people, which is exactly what AST did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wong said his new board is "a packaging innovation that allows the user to have 
better control" over how a system is upgraded. And it will cost them as little 
as half as much as the standard Compaq expansion unit. Wong said additional 
enhancement products would be forthcoming, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Packaging innovation and user control will also be the guiding principle behind 
AMKLY's personal computers, which Wong expects to launch by the year's end. He 
won't disclose details about price or performance, but says the machines will 
be designed for ease of installation, ease of maintenance and ease of use. 
</P>
<P>
That's supposed to appeal both to dealers -- who are increasingly sensitive to 
demands for better service -- and to users, who don't want to spend six hours 
taking a machine out a box and setting it up. "I don't want to mass market, and 
I don't want an esoteric product," Wong said, explaining that his machine would 
be aimed at mainstream business users who don't necessarily need the fastest 
machine on the market but put a high premium on simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according plan, AMKLY will have revenue of $20 million to $30 
million within a year, and $100 million to $150 million within five years, Wong 
said. The company now employs just 12 people but expects to be up to 45 within 
a year. It is leasing a 21,000-square-foot facility in the Irvine Spectrum for 
manufacturing and corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
The question that remains, of course, is whether the world needs another 
personal computer vendor. Alsop, for one, thinks there's still a lot of room 
for design improvements in IBM-compatible personal computers, and he notes that 
Wong has two of the critical ingredients necessary for success: credibility and 
capital. And for those attributes, he can thank AST.

KEATING TELLS TV AUDIENCE TO BLAME REGULATORS, CONGRESS FOR LINCOLN'S FALL; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: IRVINE-BASED S&amp;L'S OWNER SAYS, 'WE HAD $700 MILLION EXCESS ASSETS 
OVER LIABILITIES IN OUR SUBSIDIARY' BEFORE 'CONNIVING' RUINED HIM.

Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. owner Charles Keating said Friday that the 
"conniving" of federal regulators and the guilt of Congress are to blame for 
the multibillion-dollar failure of his Irvine-based thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said Lincoln showed a profit until it was taken over by federal 
regulators. "We had $700 million excess assets over liabilities in our 
subsidiary," he said on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" program. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators say the failed savings and loan is expected to cost taxpayers a 
record $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers they come by are numbers that are arbitrarily written down," 
Keating said of what he called the "conniving" regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous situation," he said, "and it's causing a loss unprecedented 
in the history of the United States. It's the regulators." 
</P>
<P>
Keating is appearing on a series of talk shows to defend his point of view, 
even though he took the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer the questions of 
a congressional committee investigating Lincoln's failure. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said Congress is part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress tried to stop (former top thrift regulator) Ed Gray, and a lot of 
things happened there that make them guilty," Keating said of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Gray testified before Congress last year that he turned down the request of 
five senators to ease investment rules affecting Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Those five senators are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee in 
connection with allegations of improperly trying to interfere with federal 
regulation in return for $1.3 million in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
On Cable News Network on Thursday, Keating said he made donations to the 
senators -- Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Donald Riegle, D-Mich., John Glenn, 
D-Ohio, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John McCain R-Ariz. -- because he liked 
their views on the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, a unit of American Continental Corp., may be the most spectacular of 
the nation's thrift failures, because of the expected record cost of its 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's parent filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, 1989. Regulators 
seized Lincoln a day later. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's bankruptcy left shareholders and investors with 
now-worthless stocks and bonds. Among the bondholders are about 22,000 small 
investors who bought nearly $200 million in Lincoln's corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two-thirds of the buyers were elderly Lincoln depositors, many of whom 
thought the bonds were federally insured because they were sold in Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches.

STAR WARS DEVICE EXPLODES IN TEST DESCRIBED AS SUCCESSFUL; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: NINE OF 10 OBJECTIVES WERE ACHIEVED DURING THE FIRST FLIGHT OF HEDI, 
BUILT BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SPACE SYSTEMS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, A SPOKESMAN SAID. 
</P>

<P>
The first flight test of a Star Wars weapon ended Friday when the anti-missile 
system, built by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington Beach, 
accidentally detonated before separating from its booster. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happened, nine of the 10 test objectives were accomplished, 
said Alan Sherer, manager of the Army's High Endoatmospheric Defense 
Interceptor, or HEDI, project. 
</P>
<P>
Sherer characterized the morning test launch at White Sands Missile Range in 
New Mexico as "very successful." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas officials could not be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
C.E. Grubbs, an independent defense industry consultant in Newport Beach, said 
the failure of the last step of the test should not pose a problem for the 
giant defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early stage of designing any missile system, just getting it off the 
ground is a success," Grubbs said. "The fact that their telemetry apparently 
worked is grounds to call Ripley's 'Believe It Or Not.' " The telemetry is the 
electronic linkage between a missile and ground control. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, which has received about $300 million to develop the missile 
interceptor, has about 180 employees in Huntington Beach assigned to the HEDI 
project. But Space Systems officials said last December that the firm will lay 
off or reassign 60 workers this year. Budget cuts also will delay a number of 
other test flights. 
</P>
<P>
HEDI is designed to stop nuclear warheads before they reach ground targets. It 
is one of the multiple layers planned for the Star Wars program, formally known 
as the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Sherer said the greatest successes in Friday's launch were getting the HEDI to 
cool down after firing it through the atmosphere at high speeds and the 
separation of a shroud that protects the HEDI warhead from heat and pressure 
during the launch. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever separated a shroud at these kinds of velocities and 
temperatures, and no one has attempted to cool an endo-interceptor at these 
kinds of speeds and velocities," Sherer said. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase of the test called for the missile "to go into a kind of coast 
phase and then separate the kill vehicle and then blow the warhead. We didn't 
get to do that separation of the kill vehicle" because it detonated, Sherer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The HEDI flight test was the first since the Pentagon launched the six-year, 
$383-million project in January, 1986, to design a weapon against enemy 
warheads in their last stage of flight. 
</P>
<P>
HEDI mates a sophisticated warhead -- the "smart rock" -- to a modified Sprint 
rocket. The Sprint was built for the U.S. Safeguard anti-ballistic missile 
defense in the 1960s, but has been mothballed since the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
When it nears its target, the modified Sprint rocket would eject the smart 
rock, which would use an infrared seeker and its own maneuvering jets to home 
in for the kill. The rock would explode like a hand grenade to demolish the 
warhead with lethal pellets. 
</P>
<P>
The HEDI rockets are the lower-technology end of the Star Wars system, which 
would include several defenses against enemy missiles: hitting them in their 
boost phase shortly after launch, intercepting them in mid-course when they 
cast off their warheads and decoys in space, and attacking them in the terminal 
phase when the warheads re-enter the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
HEDI would handle the terminal phase. Particle beams and laser zappers usually 
associated with Star Wars technology would make up the other layers of the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Space Systems is the prime contractor on the HEDI program. Hughes Missile 
Systems Group and Aerojet Technical Systems are the major subcontractors.

<TEXT>
<P>
Palominas, Ariz., has always been only nine miles from Mexico, but it wasn't 
until 1981 that the school district decided to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
A students exchange would broaden students' education, thought District Supt. 
Gene Brust, so he formed a committee to look into it. Palominas parents were 
alarmed: "Will our children be shot crossing the border? Isn't the water 
dangerous to drink?" 
</P>
<P>
Parents in Sonora, Mexico, were equally concerned: "Might our children be 
accosted by drug-dealing pornographers on the school playgrounds of the rock 
'n' roll society to the north?" 
</P>
<P>
Such were the stereotypes that the Hands Across the Border program has helped 
to erase. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Sonora by the Palominas planning committee completely changed the 
direction of the parents' thoughts about Mexico, Brust says. "They realized 
that they and the Sonorans had common desires, expectations and goals for their 
children in the areas of education, family values and community social 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
"It caught fire with one or two other schools, won a few awards . . . , and 
seemed to just take off from there," Brust said. Since that first trip in 1981, 
about 1,000 students have participated in the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The Hands Across the Border Foundation was established two years ago by Brust 
and others to develop a model exchange program and to help other schools secure 
funding for such programs. The foundation provides a workshop and consultant to 
help schools work with their school boards and communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, we made new friends," said Cecelia Pasquiera, a student from 
Arizpe, Mexico, who participated in a 1986 exchange. "We understand each other, 
even though we speak different languages and have different customs. For me, in 
particular, it's a way to move us to learn English in order to better 
communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Cecelia and her sixth-grade classmates visited Palominas. 
Cecelia stayed with Becky Pickett, then a 13-year-old student from Palominas, 
and went to her school. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing on the school's computers was the highlight of U. S. school for me," 
Cecelia said. "The countries are so close to each other, yet very different. I 
learned about American food, families and the way of getting along together." 
</P>
<P>
Becky and some fifth-grade classmates then visited Arizpe for three days and 
two nights. Becky stayed with Cecelia and her parents, played baseball in the 
plaza, visited Cecelia's school and participated in a cultural night there. 
</P>
<P>
Becky's schoolmates presented flags and information in Spanish about other 
foreign countries. Cecelia and her classmates gave their new friends small 
decorated boxes that they had made and filled with Mexican candy. "Language 
didn't seem to be a problem -- if we couldn't figure out how to say a word, 
we'd sign it," Becky said. "The best part for me was seeing how they live 
differently and how close their family is." 
</P>
<P>
Most participating students know a little of the others' language. English is a 
required subject in Mexican schools, although Spanish is not in Arizona's. 
However, most of the schools involved in the exchanges have set up volunteer 
programs so that the children are exposed to some basic Spanish vocabulary 
before visiting Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Hands Across the Border has been endorsed by the Arizona superintendent of 
public instruction and the Sonoran secretary of education. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Silva, undersecretary of education for the state of Sonora and a board 
member of the Hands Across the Border Foundation, said: "It is most wonderful 
for children to learn to get along better and talk about the same things. We 
are very excited with the success of the program and are looking forward to 
expanding to more states." 
</P>
<P>
The first International Conference for Hands Across the Border was held in 
Guaymas, Sonora, last March. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are concerned with where we are going in our 
relationships with Mexico. We received inquiries from schools in California, 
Texas and Canada about the model we've developed," said Carlos Nagel, the 
program's consultant. Six new schools joined the program at the conference; 
there are now 40 schools participating.

CHILDREN SURPASS PARENTS IN HOME-VIDEO GAME SKILLS

Trapped in a world where mom and dad call the shots, it's no surprise that most 
kids delight in asserting themselves in one area where they are vastly superior 
-- home-video games. 
</P>
<P>
"I like watching them do good and then destroying their score," one merciless 
youngster wisecracked. 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "I hate it when they always get mad and yell when they lose." 
</P>
<P>
The responses were recorded in a survey of 1,000 young video players conducted 
by Konami, the No. 1 supplier of software for the popular Nintendo home-video 
game system. 
</P>
<P>
There was no shortage of confidence among the youngsters surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if their parents could beat the high scores of their children, 65% of the 
youths checked the box marked, "Of course not." Another 23% said "No." Only 11% 
conceded that their parents could beat them. 
</P>
<P>
The superiority demonstrated by the youngsters was not for lack of practice on 
the parents' part, according to the survey. More and more parents are racking 
up hours at the controls of games after work and on weekends, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they hog the entire day at playing Nintendo. I never get a chance to 
brag back at them," one player wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they forget to take turns," another said. 
</P>
<P>
A more humble child was grateful just to have a video game system, saying he 
does not care if his mother plays. "After all, she bought it for me." 
</P>
<P>
Just as dad traditionally has been the one drawn to the train set and the slot 
car track after junior goes to bed, he again turns up in front of the video 
screen more often than mom. 
</P>
<P>
About 67% of the youngsters surveyed said dad plays more often, while 31% said 
mom is the primary player. Dad is a more skilled player, according to 65% of 
the respondents, while 32% said mom is better. 
</P>
<P>
Do moms and dads brag about their video game skills? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, yes, yes," one child wrote. "If I let my dad win, he brags constantly." 
</P>
<P>
Another youngster was skeptical of his father's claims: "When you were in 
school, guess what I did. I beat your score," the child quoted his father as 
saying. "I don't believe him." 
</P>
<P>
Some youngsters say their parents don't dare brag. 
</P>
<P>
"With their scores, they wouldn't ever dare to talk about them," one child 
wrote. Several others simply wrote "No," and one qualified it with, "They 
aren't too good." 
</P>
<P>
A space on the survey provided for parents' comments on video games produced a 
variety of responses. 
</P>
<P>
A very enthusiastic mother wrote: "Some are entertaining, others are 
educational, a few build coordination, etc. Personally, I'm a pretty cool Rad 
Racer!! Mom." 
</P>
<P>
A more subdued parent wrote: "Used in moderation, they are fun and help 
eye-hand coordination." 
</P>
<P>
One sarcastic dad wrote: "Beats walking the street." 
</P>
<P>
And for those who lament the decline of the American family as an institution, 
video games may hold out some hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when we play games together like Contra or Jackal; it really bonds 
us together," a child wrote.

It was only 2:30 on this Thursday afternoon outside the John Wayne Airport 
terminal, but the 12 taxicabs parked across the street were idle and empty. 
</P>
<P>
To Tony Giannicchi, who mans the Yellow Cab "starter" booth as point man for 
the lineup of taxis at the airport, the lulls in customers this day seemed 
longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Even for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Only an hour earlier at the height of the last burst of arriving travelers, 
Giannicchi was doing his maitre d' taxi bit, joking and bantering, guiding 
passengers to the nearest cab and bellowing at the drivers to keep in line. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't miss Giannicchi, whose massive and gloriously rounded figure 
suggested a cross between Jackie Gleason and Sir John Falstaff. Naturally 
gregarious with a taxi man's gift for gab, he was in his element amid all the 
commotion -- a cabbie down to his last vocal chord. 
</P>
<P>
But the 46-year-old Anaheim resident admits that Orange County isn't the 
natural habitat for his line of work. 
</P>
<P>
He should know. He has been in the taxi business for 17 years -- first in his 
native New York state, the past six years in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong," he said, waving at the cloudless sky this day. "Orange 
County's a pretty place. Lot's of sun and space. Hey, my wife and kids would 
kill me if we moved anywhere else!" 
</P>
<P>
Giannicchi was back inside the cab booth, glumly staring at the empty taxis -- 
his 400-pound girth crammed inside the closet-size enclosure. "But let's face 
it. Orange County isn't Manhattan. It isn't Boston or Philly or even L.A. You 
have to work your butt off to make it here. This isn't taxi country." 
</P>
<P>
With its suburban roots, its breakaway from the life style and density of old 
big-city cores, its multitudes of families who get around in their own 
multi-car fleets, Orange County has never had a great demand for taxis. 
</P>
<P>
New York City, America's taxi capital, boasts 11,700 licensed cabs. Washington 
has 7,000, Chicago, 4,800, Los Angeles 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's handful of licensed companies can muster no more than 280 cabs, 
and most of these are with the three major established firms -- Yellow Cab of 
North Orange County, Coast Yellow Cab Cooperative and West Coast Cab. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these majors, whose combined rosters total most of the 490 drivers in 
Orange County, said the taxi business is growing very nicely, thanks to the 
expanding office, hotel and tourist developments. 
</P>
<P>
And these firms still manage to attract people to be cab drivers, despite the 
job's still lowly status, its financially precarious reputation and its image 
as a prime target for holdups. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County taxi force reflects the classic, all-walks-of-life strata 
synonymous with the business -- everyone from teachers, aerospace workers, 
computer technicians and sales clerks to recently arrived immigrants and 
unemployed seasonal workers from other fields. (Women still constitute a small 
minority.) 
</P>
<P>
But these firms admitted that their line of work is still burdened by the "old 
image problem" -- the feeling that many taxi drivers are a rather shady lot. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County firms are regulated by the cities in which they operate, 
there are none of the city-required "taxi schools" on driving basics and 
customer relations found in New York City and some other Eastern areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, local firms pointed out that prospective drivers are required to 
have clean driving records and must pass police-record checks in order to 
receive city-issued taxi driver permits. And firms said the number of local 
complaints over taxi service -- such as overcharging and roundabout trips -- 
are relatively few, including those reported to the city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the taxi business, being what it is, hasn't lost its transient image, even 
in Orange County. As in the other areas, the turnover in drivers remains very 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been like this -- taxi driving is a tough occupation," explained 
Alfred LaGasse, executive vice president of the International Taxicab Assn. 
based in Kensington, Md. "A great many people have always drifted in and out of 
the field." 
</P>
<P>
But there has also been a solid core of career drivers, many of whom stay in 
the field for decades. "The job appeals to the maverick independent in a lot of 
people," said LaGasse. "It's sort of like being the last of the cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
Like Tony Giannicchi. 
</P>
<P>
He started driving in 1973 with a cab company in Binghamton, N.Y. "It was 
supposed to be temporary, a way to make a few extra bucks while figuring what I 
was going to do with my life," recalled Giannicchi, who had worked previously 
as a cook, a purchasing agent (while in the Air Force) and a shoe-factory 
laborer. "But it kind of grows on you. It gets in your blood.," 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Giannicchi, married and raising six children, migrated to California 
and right off became a full-time driver in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Although Giannicchi is currently employed by Coast Yellow Cab as a taxi 
coordinator -- he assigns cabs early each morning at Coast's Fountain Valley 
headquarters and mans the airport booth most weekdays -- he still drives a 
leased cab once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I find I miss it. I like driving. There's something about being out on the 
streets. It's not anything like a 9-to-5 job. You're on your own. You're like a 
small, independent businessman -- except your firm is the cab." 
</P>
<P>
There is yet another major job perk. "You never know who's going get into your 
cab. Some flake. Some corporate bigwig. I even drove Martina Navratilova once," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And some passengers just love to gab. Well, I'm known to be a little gabby and 
have a few opinions, too," he grinned, in obvious understatement, "and we'll 
take on any and every subject: Noriega. Gorbachev. Eastern Europe. Bush. The 
Super Bowl. You name it!" 
</P>
<P>
Even at 7:30 a.m. this Friday, after he had spent three hours assigning cabs, 
Giannicchi looked fresh and chipper for his 12-hour driving shift. 
</P>
<P>
He was casually dressed -- red sweater and blue jeans -- a far cry from the 
one-time somber uniform look of taxi drivers. He was also cap-less. 
</P>
<P>
He squeezed into the front seat of a Ford sedan, put the map book away, and 
placed his good-luck toy doggie on the dashboard. He then slipped his Newport 
Beach and Costa Mesa taxi driver permits into a window pocket. Stashed to one 
side were his science-fiction books -- an Isaac Asimov and a Frederik Pohl -- 
to read during long waits. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure never lets up," he said, as he drove onto the San Diego Freeway. 
"We live from fare to fare." At Coast Yellow Cab, the standard 12-hour leasing 
costs are $58 for the vehicle, plus mileage and gas charges. A typical 175-mile 
shift would cost the driver around $82. The rest goes to the driver as 
take-home pay. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher radio -- always turned on -- is their lifeline. "You always have 
to be ready to grab a pick-up if you're within 10 minutes away. You got to be 
fast or the other guy's going to take it." Otherwise, he is based at the 
airport on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
"You just pray your fare will be a biggie." This means a $61 fare to Los 
Angeles International Airport or, at the very least, a $24 one to Disneyland or 
the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The standard rates in Orange County are $3.10 the first mile, $1.40 each 
additional mile, slightly lower than those in Los Angeles but much higher than 
the New York City rates where, Giannicchi said, the business is not only far 
greater but fleet maintenance costs are lower. 
</P>
<P>
But most trips from the John Wayne Airport are quickies -- to offices, hotels 
and residences close to the airport or no farther than Newport Beach or Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get picky, though," said Giannicchi, as he took his place at the end 
of the airport lineup. "The longer runs can come in bunches, then not again for 
weeks. Except for L.A. or Westwood, the farthest I've ever driven is San Diego, 
and that was only once." 
</P>
<P>
At 9:20 a.m., Giannicchi finally made it to the head of the line -- nearly two 
hours into his shift. 
</P>
<P>
He drove a businessman to an apartment complex in Newport Beach. The metered 
fare: $8.50. The tip: $1.50. "That's about par -- nothing big, nothing meager. 
But standard," he said of the tip. 
</P>
<P>
Answering a dispatcher call, he picked up two airport-bound passengers at a 
close-by Costa Mesa motor inn. The fare: $7.90. The tip: 10 cents. "Now, that's 
a little meager," he said sourly, rolling his eyes heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are OK, maybe not big tippers, but reasonable. Some of the best 
tippers are businessmen at the trade shows. The worst conventioneers," he added 
with a grimace, "are, so help me, doctors and attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
"Women executives are lousy tippers. Any time. Hey, I don't want to sound 
chauvinistic, but that's the truth. They don't seem to understand the art of 
tipping." 
</P>
<P>
His most-remembered case of under-tipping involved a drive to Linda Isle in 
Newport Harbor. "Talk about posh. The house was on the water. Outside were a 
Rolls, a Jag and a Mercedes. The fare was $11.60. He gave me $12 and told me to 
keep the change." 
</P>
<P>
As the man walked away, Giannicchi, who was having a bad day anyway, was livid. 
He dug into his pocket, took out 40 cents and tossed it on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"Ok, maybe that was a wee bit rude of me. But I'll tell you, I felt better!" 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., Giannicchi was back at the airport, standing outside his cab, 
sipping a Diet 7-Up and joking around with the other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Business was at least picking up. Giannicchi had racked up four more fares, 
including a $24 trip to the Anaheim Hilton and squeezing in time for a quick, 
drive-thru hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
His waiting-time discourse this time: driving around Orange County. "It was a 
cultural shock for me when I came here (in 1984). You got nothing but freeways 
and families with two or three cars. No one stands on the corner flagging taxis 
down. If they did, people would think they were crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other transplanted drivers, Giannicchi got lost in the sprawl. He 
wasn't used to meandering new tract streets, the criss-crossing maze of 
freeways, the absence of easy landmarks. "If I didn't see the ocean, or smell 
it, I didn't know where the hell I was." 
</P>
<P>
But he is impressed by the motorists here. "Drivers out here are more courteous 
-- if you discount the drive-by shooters. Most people let you pass and smile 
back. Drivers back in New York fight for every inch of road. And they don't 
smile." 
</P>
<P>
In his 17 years as a taxi driver, he has never been robbed or attacked. "I'm 
lucky, I guess, and I want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Although the incidence of violence against taxi drivers is less in Orange 
County, some nationally publicized studies have confirmed the high-risk factor. 
Like all-night clerks and similar occupations, taxi drivers are considered 
among the most susceptible to being robbed or murdered. 
</P>
<P>
The last taxi-driver murder in Orange County was about nine years ago, taxi 
officials said. The number of reported robberies involving drivers has been 
sporadic, they claim, averaging about one every month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Giannicchi, like other drivers, follows some rather clear-cut rules of 
the road. "You stick to areas you're familiar with. You keep out of the obvious 
trouble spots. You trust your instincts about whether to pick up a fare or 
leave them. I don't drive late at night, either." 
</P>
<P>
But if "worst came to worst, you don't resist," he said. "You let them take 
what you have. You don't play hero." 
</P>
<P>
When the subject turned to the traditional derogatory image of taxi drivers, 
one especially linked to the street-hard New York City cabbie, Giannicchi 
sounded both disgusted and dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
"That reputation's a bum rap. Sure, I know the image -- that all drivers are 
lazy, can't find a better job, can't be trusted and are always out to gouge 
you. OK, there's always a few bad apples, and some of that image fits these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Added Giannicchi, his voice rising: "Most people treat us with respect. But 
some passengers treat us like dirt, like we're beneath them, like you don't 
exist. Maybe it's that crummy image, or maybe they need someone to kick around. 
</P>
<P>
"But let me tell you: the great majority of drivers are decent working people. 
We resent it when people lump us all in the same barrel with the bad apples -- 
especially when we're out there breaking our necks trying to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Financially, being a cab driver is a real roller coaster, said Giannicchi, as 
he drove back into the Coast Yellow Cab yard at 7:30 p.m., the end of his 
shift. 
</P>
<P>
He figured he is making around $20,000 a year as a full-time cab coordinator 
and part-time driver for Coast. If he were still working full time as a driver, 
he estimated he would be making about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
His total earnings this Friday, including tips, were around $150. That meant a 
take-home pay of at least $70. 
</P>
<P>
Not too bad, Giannicchi said, especially for a Friday that had started so 
badly. "You never know how it's going to turn out. It's like gambling. You can 
hit the jackpot one day -- like breaking $100 in take-home pay. Other times, 
you're lucky if you break even." 
</P>
<P>
On the worst days, it's easy for taxi drivers to think of quitting the 
business. Giannicchi admitted that he's had those dog days, too. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas Eve, 1984, started out that way. 
</P>
<P>
He was a struggling newcomer to Orange County who had just brought his family 
out from New York. "We were then living day to day in a motel, my wife and I 
just earning enough for food and lodging." 
</P>
<P>
But not enough, he remembered, to buy a Christmas tree or presents for the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
So he kept driving the streets, even though Christmas Eve business was 
extremely slow and he had made barely enough to cover leasing expenses. He was 
about to call it a day when he answered one last call: a pick-up fare on Balboa 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger's fare for his trip to north Costa Mesa was $10. But the "guy 
gave me $50, told me to keep the change and wished me a Merry Christmas!" 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, Giannicchi is obviously still warmed -- and somewhat awed -- 
by the memory of that passenger's grand gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"My family had a great Christmas -- after all -- that year." Then still 
grinning, he added: "That $40 is still the biggest tip I've ever gotten." 
</P>

SHERRARD FINALLY CAUGHT GOOD BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS: TOUGH-LUCK RECEIVER GOES FROM LAST-PLACE COWBOYS TO SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS 
-- AND HE'S PLAYING AGAIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-six passes were thrown in this year's NFC championship game, three 
intercepted by San Francisco defenders, two caught for San Francisco touchdowns 
and one batted away by Ronnie Lott, the nothing-is-free safety, preempting 
Flipper before the Rams' very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But the pass Mike Sherrard will never forget was a short out to the sideline, a 
fly-speck of a pattern that gained the 49ers all of six yards a minute before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes dilated five times their normal size," Sherrard says. "I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Sherrard had seen such a pass -- i.e., one thrown to him -- the 
year was 1986 and his allegiance was to the Dallas Cowboys. One year out of 
UCLA, he looked one year away from the Pro Bowl, catching 41 passes for 744 
yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
No Cowboy rookie since Bob Hayes had caught as many balls -- or stopped as many 
clocks. Sherrard was a 4.3-second man in the 40-yard sprint, 4.2 on his good 
days. He was a 23-year-old on the go, with places to see, people to beat and 
land to scorch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a starter for 10 years," Sherrard says. "I was going to the 
Pro Bowl. I was going to the playoffs . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it didn't happen that way." 
</P>
<P>
At least as obvious as the scars on Sherrard's right leg, reminders of the 
metal plates and screws that had once been inside. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard had broken the first commandment of self-preservation as an NFL wide 
receiver. He broke a leg. It is the torn rotator cuff of his particular skill 
group, the one injury to avoid when you make your living trying to outrun 
professional defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Do it once and people start talking about you in the past tense, in hushes and 
whispers, grieving over the loss of that beloved first step. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard did it twice. Within a span of eight months. 
</P>
<P>
The first break came during the Cowboys' training camp of 1987. The second came 
on the beaches of Southern California, in March 1988, while Sherrard was trying 
to rehabilitate the leg. Soon, he was rehabilitating the rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sherrard owns a personal statistical printout unequaled by any 
active player: 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- Did Not Play. 
</P>
<P>
1988 -- Did Not Play.

1989 -- Did Not Play. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Sherrard is active again. That's Part I of the big news. Part II is the 
gold-and-red hat on his head -- helmet of the San Francisco 49ers, crown of the 
reigning world champions, in New Orleans to defend the title. 
</P>
<P>
From Dallas to the Super Bowl. You can't get there from here, they say. 
</P>
<P>
But Sherrard found a way, though he'd never endorse the method. 
</P>
<P>
After two breaks and too many team doctors telling him he'd never play again, 
Sherrard opted for Plan B free agency when the Cowboys left him unprotected 
last winter. 
</P>
<P>
To his pleasant surprise, Sherrard found suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers, Phoenix and Green Bay," Sherrard says, ticking them off. "I had 
legitimate offers from all three. Green Bay told me, 'Mike, you can be a 
starter right away.' Phoenix offered good money." 
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco offered something more. 
</P>
<P>
"Location was important, and money was important," Sherrard says, "but I didn't 
want to go somewhere where I'd be rushed. The 49ers are a team with a 
reputation for taking a certain talent and getting the most out of it. I knew I 
could take my time. With (Jerry) Rice and (John) Taylor, I knew I wouldn't be 
rushed back on the field." 
</P>
<P>
That mattered greatly to Sherrard, who believes he was rushed into his second 
fracture by doctors in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"The first break was freakish," he says. "It happened, basically, because my 
muscles were fatigued. The second time, I got bad medical advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an operation to remove metal plates and screws from my leg, and two 
months later the doctor had me running on the beach. I paid for his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I was left with screw holes in the bone; the bone was still too weak. But I 
didn't go to medical school. I didn't know. Live and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard and the Cowboy medical staff were at odds until the end. Sherrard 
decided to try the open market when he became convinced that doctors would 
never clear him to play again in Dallas, and now he believes they tried to 
sandbag him to the clubs that showed interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept saying I'd never play again," Sherrard says. "I don't think they 
would have ever passed me on a physical. They'd say I could break it again by 
jumping or cutting or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"Staying in Dallas, I felt, would be cutting my own throat. I kind of felt I 
was in a position where I had to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers gave Sherrard the two things he wanted: a chance and some time. He 
opened the 1989 season on the physically-unable-to-play list and stayed there 
throughout the regular season, carefully running routes and taking hits in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco activated him for the playoffs, using him in four-receiver 
passing situations against the Minnesota Vikings. No passes were thrown his 
way. Then came the Rams and that six-yard completion, followed two plays later 
by another catch, this good for 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were on their way to their third touchdown of the game, and Sherrard, 
in his mind, was on his way to comeback player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, just being on the field is it," he says. "That makes me real 
happy. Catching a ball, getting a first down -- all that is gravy." 
</P>
<P>
And now, the Super Bowl. For an ex-Cowboy, it's tough to fathom. From a 3-13 
situation to one win from it all. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty good career move. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at my career," Sherrard says, "it's been nothing but peaks and 
valleys. Being the Cowboys' No. 1 pick -- then holding out. My rookie year -- 
and the (players') strike. Breaking my leg and switching teams -- and now this. 
</P>
<P>
"So many things have happened in a short career. I just hope I can level out . 
. . on top." 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Sherrard always figured he was due for a different 
kind of break.
