Michael Landon takes the highway back to prime-time TV in "Where Pigeons Go to 
Die," a new movie airing Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
</P>
<P>
In the two-hour film, the former "Highway to Heaven" star plays 50-year-old 
Hugh Baudoum, who wistfully recalls the relationship he shared as a youngster 
with his grandfather (Art Carney). At the same time, Hugh must decide whether 
to sell his late "Da's" house. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hy Gorman plays Hugh as a 10-year-old boy who once trained homing 
pigeons and learned about the value of home in the process.

"What you see is what you get" with our Mayor Maureen, and it has been so since 
her first race for city council, when she wore her princess clothes to the 
delight of everyone, and had no "issue" except her famous "open door." Maureen 
is not as intelligent as her twin, but she is also not mean-spirited, and she's 
blessed with liking people, and people respond. 
</P>
<P>
She gave us a wonderful party, and it is still going on in Balboa Park to 
capacity crowds. She doesn't look like a man, nor act like a man, thank 
goodness, and she has proved effective in ways that count to the average 
person. 
</P>
<P>
We have had too many hard-headed, insensitive, and corrupt politicians and 
businessmen running San Diego for 30 years -- some real dingbats -- to the 
point of looking like "the banana republic of the Southwest". We needed a 
calmer city government. 
</P>
<P>
Your paper is usually excellent in coverage, but not this time. Take a look at 
who else San Diegans have overwhelmingly endorsed before you came on the scene 
-- even afterward: Nixon, with his "promise" to end the Vietnam War, and 
dressed the White House in what looked like Middle Ages livery; Reagan, who 
never read anything but his file cards, and didn't know an issue from a hole in 
the ground; and Sneaky Pete -- whom you seem to be bent on anointing, as was 
done before by our local media. 
</P>
<P>
Come talk to the people, as Maureen does, and learn that many voted for Pete 
Wilson as senator to get him out of San Diego, so he couldn't do any more harm 
here!

Los Angeles also continues to suffer the same civic ills set forth:

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: FRET ALERT; 
</P>
<P>
TOP 10 REASONS TO BRACE YOURSELF FOR STILL ANOTHER YEAR OF LIVING WITH ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S A LITTLE LATE in the new year to be bringing this up, but something called 
the National Anxiety Center in Maplewood, N.J., has published a list of the Top 
10 things to worry about in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The list also includes 90 other things to worry about, but we probably 
shouldn't worry about them, because the center's point is that we ought to set 
some priorities, so we don't worry about everything. 
</P>
<P>
As a person who tends to be a worrier, I really don't need the list. I have my 
own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
I worry mostly about things that aren't going to happen. As my wife says, on 
vacation trips I always carry a bag of worst scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Just to get them out of the way, here are the anxiety center's Top 10: AIDS, 
drug abuse, nuclear waste, the ozone layer, famine, the homeless, the federal 
deficit, air pollution, water pollution and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Those are formidable bugaboos indeed. They give us a sense of despair. They 
seem to be rushing toward us like a tidal wave. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea how to alleviate any of them. Alan Caruba, executive director of 
the NAC, hasn't either. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask the center if we have any solutions to these problems," he says. 
"Frankly, we haven't the slightest clue." 
</P>
<P>
I can't figure out what the center's game is. From the flyer I was sent I don't 
see how it hopes to make any profit. It gives an address (P.O. Box 40, 
Maplewood, N.J. 07040) but doesn't offer anything for sale and doesn't appeal 
for donations. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the anxiety center has taken its cue from the Transcendental Meditation 
folks, who believe that if enough people meditate about the stock market or 
China or the Israeli-Palestinian problem, they can alter such matters in a 
favorable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone in the country were to worry simultaneously about the ozone layer, 
could that protect it? Perhaps -- if their worry prodded them into doing what 
has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, most of us worry only about the calamities that may overtake us 
as individuals. I worry about an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose that the Big One will level the city, but all I can think about is my 
own house. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that the earthquake will not only destroy our house but will destroy it 
just as our remodeling is about to be finished, thus leaving us not only 
homeless but in financial ruin as well. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that when the Big One comes, I will either be riding in an elevator or 
driving through the 2nd Street tunnel. If I became trapped in an elevator with 
several other victims, my claustrophobia would kill me. Being buried alive in 
the tunnel would be worse than death. 
</P>
<P>
Though the NAC doesn't mention it, I worry that a comet will strike the Earth, 
killing me. That's quite possible. Some scientists believe that a comet wiped 
out the dinosaurs 60 million years ago. There's no reason to believe that one 
couldn't get me. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that when my wife and I go to Egypt (if we do), the Great Pyramid will 
collapse and bury me in it. The fact that it has stood firm for 4,500 years is 
no reason to believe that it won't collapse while I'm in it. If things are 
going to happen, they're going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that I will buy myself a winning lottery ticket but that I will forget 
to find out the winning numbers and will go on never knowing that I have won. 
</P>
<P>
What I don't know won't hurt me, of course, but that doesn't keep me from 
worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that our income tax returns will be audited -- and we will have nothing 
to hide. One of our tax men said my wife and I were the most honest taxpayers 
in his experience. That doesn't mean the auditors couldn't find something. Even 
with expert help, nobody can file a tax return that something can't be found 
wrong with. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I worry that I will be caught in a traffic jam on the Santa Ana 
Freeway and will die. 
</P>
<P>
I do not worry about a heart attack, since my bypass is supposed to protect me 
from that, but I worry that in a traffic jam on the Santa Ana Freeway I will 
die of old age. I worry that I will die either of having too much cholesterol 
or not enough. One day I read that cholesterol is good for you, and the next 
that it will kill you. I've decided to leave it alone. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that I will die of malathion poisoning. We live in one of the areas 
that they sprayed by helicopter. I can't believe that anything that will kill 
fruit flies is good for me. 
</P>
<P>
One of the anxiety center's Top 10 things was garbage. Garbage used to be 
kitchen scraps, and everything else was trash. I worry that the distinction has 
been lost.

MAN BITES TOWN: PROPHET AND LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
HE HAS SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT IS SMALL, HIP AND PROFITABLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A LOT OF WOMEN I know -- otherwise intelligent, skeptical, feet-on-the-ground 
people who would not be easy marks for, say, an aluminum-siding scam -- have 
this semi-secret habit. Just for, you know, fun, they slip off every once in a 
while to see a psychic. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned about the wisdom of consulting someone whose credentials 
consist of picking up vibes and keeping up the rent payments on a small room, 
these women smile and utter something about psychics being cheaper than shrinks 
and often just as insightful. 
</P>
<P>
Men, on the other hand, are rational, logical creatures. Men, who wouldn't 
dream of crossing Madame Rosa's bead-shadowed palm with 25 bucks, will fork 
over funds in the low double thousands for the privilege of sitting in a hotel 
ballroom to get the scoop from a "futurist." Throughout the '70s and '80s, but 
especially as the decades turned, we've been bombarded with the speculations of 
John ("Megatrends") Naisbitt and a woman named Faith Popcorn, foreseeing trends 
such as "nesting" and "cocooning." For all I know, their latest reports predict 
the onset of "pupating." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you do need to be a genius to know that, at a certain 
age, most members of any human generation will begin to reproduce. Oh, sure, it 
seems obvious now, but who knew that two-job couples would want more take-home 
food? And maybe Faith Popcorn wasn't born Faith Plotkin. 
</P>
<P>
Futurism and megatrendism are only the most pretentious versions of the 
pseudo-scientific hand-holding to which this country's decision makers are 
addicted, as if crackpots are more habit-forming than crack. For short-range 
decisions, such as what TV shows to crank out or how tasteless a beer to brew, 
executives turn to the variety of psychics who peer into focus groups rather 
than crystal balls; we call them market researchers. Just on sheer percentage 
of accurate predictions, Madame Rosa can give these guys a good run for our 
money. 
</P>
<P>
For the long-range stuff, like whether to move all manufacturing facilities out 
of this country, the decision makers call a Faith Popcorn. The '90s will be a 
time of (choose one): neo-rebellion, retro-cuisine or a boom in home billiard 
tables. Better move the factories offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Because we all seem to share this deeply felt need to consult some incredibly 
unqualified oracle, and because new decades don't begin every year or two, I'm 
offering my reading of the next -- oh, what's bigger than mega? -- giga-trend: 
The human race will painstakingly reconstruct the limits we've spent the last 
couple of centuries systematically destroying. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Gompers, a labor leader at the dawn of the AF of L, was once asked what 
his movement wanted. He spoke for all mankind when he described his goal in one 
word: more. From the 3-year-old who overdoses on ice cream to the developer who 
thinks a certain stretch of Wilshire in Westwood cries out for one more 
pied-a-terre for nervous rich foreigners, we have pushed against the limits. 
And as long as there were limits, it was a noble struggle. 
</P>
<P>
But since we've removed all natural restraints against the human urges to eat, 
build, consume and burn, it's been about as noble a struggle as a 15-rounder 
between Mike Tyson and Spud Webb. Once mountains enclosed us in cohesive little 
groupings: We tunneled through them or ground them down to kibble. Once 
ferocious beasts competed with us for food and land: A little gunpowder did the 
trick. Once nighttime held us fast in our shelters: Now electrons do our 
bidding, and all that keeps us home is bad movies and lack of a sitter. 
</P>
<P>
Nature, having run out of limits for us to grapple with, now brandishes the big 
guns: the various possibilities of extinction that brighten the front pages 
between scandals. So we've been seeing feeble attempts to reconstruct the 
intricate web of restrictions that we've torn apart: No longer limited by the 
difficulty of obtaining food, we don Lycra garments and cavort to 120 beats per 
minute to avoid becoming walking zeppelins. No longer threatened by a serious 
rival for any environmental niche we covet, we pass laws suggesting that maybe 
we shouldn't carve up, fill up or blow up every inch of our planet. 
</P>
<P>
When first broached by the oddly hedonistic ascetics around Jerry Brown in the 
'70s, the idea of limits was something grim, parched, somehow a punishment for 
our success as a species: We won the game, and we get "small is beautiful"? It 
was a vision only an ex-monk could love. This time around, though, reinstalling 
the fences around human yearning will be packaged as an exciting challenge. 
It'll be hip. It'll be fun. It'll be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea what form this trend will assume -- hey, I'm only blue-skying 
here. But the discovery that societal muscles, like physical muscles, need an 
opposing force to struggle against will be powerful stuff. If I were running a 
seminar in a hotel ballroom, I'd call it something like "Social Isometrics." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing I should tell you: You'll take a long journey during the '90s, 
and you'll meet an attractive stranger.

CLOTHES MAKE THE MOVIE;

<P>
THE NEW EDITH HEADS OF HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO, Paddy Calistro is the author of Edith Head's Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THEY SPEND MORE TIME looking through fashion magazines and history books than 
sketching. They devote hours to shopping at Bullock's, Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Western Costume. They scour garage sales and downtown clothing shops in search 
of the perfect icon of an era. These scavengers of style are the new breed of 
costume designers, the new Edith Heads of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Head, who lavishly costumed more than 1,000 films for Paramount and Universal 
and won eight Academy Awards, began her career in the 1920s and worked until 
her death in 1981. During her heyday, the '30s and '40s, quality workmanship 
was affordable, and fashion trends, such as padded shoulders, were born on the 
screen. Today, independent costume designers are limited by labor costs and 
movie realism. Often, rather than create original garments, they opt to adapt 
what they buy off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
But the glamour isn't lost. Costume design is still a business played out under 
the spotlight. Working with the world's top actors and directors, the new 
designers wield the creative power to shape, via costume, today's box-office 
hits. Most of the designers featured here have been nominated for Academy 
Awards, but none has won. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
AGGIE GUERARD RODGERS 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Aggie Guerard Rodgers lived the San Joaquin Valley life that 
George Lucas captured in his 1973 film, "American Graffiti." So it made sense 
that she landed the costume designer's job. Besides, no one else would work 
within Lucas' skimpy $4,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The film's madras shirts and pleated skirts were an auspicious start for 
Rodgers, who is now 46 and has a master's degree in costume design from Cal 
State Long Beach. She went on to bigger films, including "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest," the Best Picture of 1975, "The Return of the Jedi," which had a 
costume budget of $800,000, and "The Color Purple," for which she earned her 
first Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
For "Beetlejuice," Rodgers stretched her imagination to dress Michael Keaton 
who, as a demon wandering hell and earth, appears in a wild black-and-white 
suit. One scene called for Keaton's arms to turn into hammers and his head to 
become a carousel, so Rodgers worked with technicians to fit mechanical devices 
inside the garment. Special effects also required Rodgers to carefully design 
the pajamas worn by Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Witches 
of Eastwick." Cut-away duplicates had to accommodate harnesses used during 
flight scenes. 
</P>
<P>
In all of her projects, Rodgers uses a piece of her late mother's wardrobe. For 
"I Love You to Death," which opens soon, she included her mother's jewelry in a 
dinner scene. Says Rodgers: "I'm very sentimental." 
</P>
<P>
DEBORAH NADOOLMAN 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Nadoolman, who cut her teeth on television costume design, scrounged up 
black Ray-Ban shades for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi in the 1980 film "The 
Blues Brothers," and a Wayfarer trend was born. In 1981, she outfitted Harrison 
Ford in his battered flight jacket and fedora for "Raiders of the Lost Ark." 
And in 1982, she created the red-and-black leather jacket for Michael Jackson's 
"Thriller" video. It's no coincidence that safari gear and the leather look 
have been popular ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had tremendous luck," says the 37-year-old wife of director John Landis. 
"The clothes I've designed have gone on to become part of the popular culture." 
Last year, the jacket that Nadoolman distressed by hand with a wire brush for 
"Raiders" earned a place in the entertainment collection of the Smithsonian 
Institution's Museum of American History. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Nadoolman, who holds a master's degree in costume design from 
UCLA, worked on Eddie Murphy's "Coming to America." For the modern fairy tale, 
she fashioned what she calls the "African ascot" look, combining ethnic motifs 
and '50s couture silhouettes. "The goal was to establish the enormity of 
Zamunda's wealth," she says of the fictitious country. The result was a tuxedo 
topped by an ocelot skin, complete with cubic zirconium eyes; crown jewels of 
real pearls, semiprecious stones and paste diamonds -- and Nadoolman's first 
Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
MARILYN VANCE-STRAKER 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Vance-Straker, 42, is known as a modern-day costume designer because 
many of her films, such as "The Breakfast Club," "Die Hard" and "Uncle Buck," 
take place in the undefined present. The contemporary stories pose problems 
that period pieces don't. Because most wardrobes are designed at least 18 
months before the film is released, "you have to anticipate trends or avoid 
them because otherwise the film looks dated," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Quick problem-solving is Vance-Straker's forte, so she was disappointed but 
prepared when disaster struck Brian De Palma's "The Untouchables." "After the 
longest wait, we got the suits from Giorgio Armani in Italy -- $200,000 worth, 
mind you -- and then we spent the next 72 days remaking every inch," she 
recalls. "The shape of the lapels, the pads in the shoulders, the pocket 
treatments, the sleeves, the width of the pant legs, even the lining -- nothing 
worked." Though Armani demanded on-screen credit, her rescue effort brought her 
first Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and a former 
sportswear designer, Vance-Straker usually works on three films a year. 
"Sometimes the amount of time you spend is purely determined by the bottom 
line," she says. "If the producers can afford you for only two weeks, you give 
them all you've got for 14 days. You approach every film as if it's going to be 
a major hit, so every film is your best effort." 
</P>
<P>
ELLEN MIROJNICK 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Mirojnick is as interested in characters' psyches as she is in their 
costumes. So, long before the 40-year-old designer sits down at her drawing 
table, she explores "how they feel about love and hate, why they feel the way 
they do." Her character analysis has determined the costumes for "The Flamingo 
Kid," "Cocktail," "Talk Radio" and Steven Spielberg's latest release, "Always." 
</P>
<P>
She has become linked to Michael Douglas, whom she has dressed in three films 
-- not bad for someone who was thrown out of the Parsons School of Design for 
flunking pattern-making.To turn him into the unscrupulous Gordon Gekko in "Wall 
Street," Mirojnick researched men in similar jobs and then embellished reality. 
Where she found classic suspenders, a plain white shirt and a simple paisley 
tie, she replaced them with ostentatious striped braces with white leather 
attachments, a notice-me blue shirt with a white collar and an I-dare-you 
brocade tie. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast are the somber black wardrobes of at least two of her other 
films. For "Fatal Attraction," Mirojnick designed to foreshadow Douglas' 
psychological state as a cheating husband whose lover is out to kill him: "His 
spirits got darker and darker as the story progressed, and so did the clothes." 
For "Black Rain," Mirojnick styled clothing to emphasize Douglas' hostility as 
a no-nonsense detective: "It was important that he feel like a tough guy, so I 
gave him tight clothes and slick textures. The leather jacket was the obvious 
choice."

Is General Motors chairman Roger Smith also image conscious?

Several sources in town tell us that calls have recently been placed by a GM 
rep to find a PR firm willing to consider a campaign to offset the unflattering 
image of Smith and GM in the Warner Bros. documentary "Roger &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
Film maker Michael Moore, who made the movie about the impact of GM's plant 
closings on Flint, Mich., has also alleged that GM is in search of a Hollywood 
publicist. 
</P>
<P>
But when we called GM, they denied it, insisting, "No such queries have been 
made." Added Bill Ott, director of media relations for GM, Los Angeles: "GM is 
not going to do anything that in any way promotes that guy's movie, for 
heaven's sake." 
</P>
<P>
"Roger &amp; Me," which has already grossed more than $2.2 million, will expand 
from 103 screens to 250 on Feb. 9. From Pat H. Broeske

The resurrection of Jim Morrison continues: The late lead singer of the Doors, 
who'll be the subject of a soon-to-shoot film directed by Oliver Stone, is 
currently the subject of a decidedly offbeat video tribute by German singer 
Nina Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
The video -- yet to be issued here -- opens at Morrison's Paris gravesite, 
where a Morrison look-alike with angel's wings is perched on the gravestone. 
</P>
<P>
Nina appears from a cluster of fans to take a heavenly phone call -- Mahalia 
Jackson requesting that Nina sing the gospel tune "Hold Me." Nina protests, 
"But I'm a white chick." Mahalia talks her into it. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the video finds Nina dancing and singing through Paris streets, 
doing "Hold Me" rock 'n' roll style. 
</P>
<P>
For PolyGram's Mercury label, it's a cut from an album titled "Nina Hagen," 
available domestically only as an import. From Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: IMPERFECT 'MERMAID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Calendar reader and animation buff William Simpson is a dedicated fan of "The 
Little Mermaid" -- he's seen Disney's animated hit nine times, by his count -- 
but he's also discovered it's less than perfect. Calling it "my all-time 
favorite Disney film for sure," he nonetheless cites "a few of the more obvious 
continuity errors" he's noted during his multiple viewings: 
</P>
<P>
* Ursula's lipstick mysteriously vanishes the moment before she applies it. 
</P>
<P>
* Max the dog licks Ariel's right cheek but, as Ariel reacts, she rubs her left 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
* The thimble that Sebastian the crab catches on his foot disappears, then 
reappears only to disappear again. 
</P>
<P>
* Sebastian himself disappears in a shot with King Triton near the end of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
* Lemon slices magically vanish from Grimsby's dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
* Countless positioning errors made in transition from long-shot to close-up. 
</P>
<P>
"In live-action films, minor inconsistencies may be forgiven," says Simpson, 
for 10 years the voice of Whimsical Will, who delivers the Demented News on 
KLSX-FM's "Dr. Demento" show. "But in animation, with its storyboarding and 
frame-by-frame plotting, continuity errors are inexcusable. I enjoy 'The Little 
Mermaid' too much to think it was the victim of sloppy production." 
</P>
<P>
A Disney rep says that the studio is happy Simpson's seen the movie nine times 
and hopes he sees it nine more -- but had no further comment. From John M. 
Wilson

LOOKS: DRY CYCLE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MOISTURIZERS REPLENISH THE BODY'S NATURAL PROTECTION AGAINST PARCHED SKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BY THE END of January, the effects of winter are etched only too clearly on 
many Southern California faces. Changes in humidity and dramatic differences 
between indoor and outdoor temperatures leave complexions lined, flaky and 
rough. Even people with oily skin may suffer from parched skin and turn to 
moisturizers for relief. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of reaching for old-fashioned moisturizers that are thick and 
greasy, or even the lighter creams and lotions of the past decade, people with 
dry skin are seeking longer-lasting solutions. In response, cosmetics companies 
are introducing moisturizers formulated to combat the causes of moisture loss. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, those causes have been misunderstood. For instance, an American 
pharmaceutical company surveyed 440 consumers and 220 dermatologists and found 
that while most of the doctors considered aging to be the major cause of dry 
skin, most of the consumers listed the sun as the main offender. Ironically, 
the laymen, not the experts, appear to be on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
"Associating dry skin with aging is a major fallacy," says Peter Elias, vice 
chairman of dermatology at the UCSF School of Medicine. "There is no 
relationship. Dry skin can happen at any age." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to understand how rough, flaky skin would be so readily linked with 
aging. After all, the body's natural oil production does slow somewhat over the 
years. But, says James Leyden, professor of dermatology at the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine, "the majority of people produce approximately 
the same amount of oil. The outer layers of the skin are prime (targets) for 
abuse, however, and that abuse may cause dry skin, regardless of age." 
</P>
<P>
The outermost layers of skin cells, technically known as the stratum corneum, 
were once thought to be inactive and unnecessary, but doctors have discovered 
that they determine the moisture content of the skin. Fats and proteins serve 
as a kind of mortar that bonds the layers of cells together. An unbroken 
stratum corneum serves as a protective barrier against the environment and 
seals in moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Cold temperatures, low humidity and increased sun exposure deplete the fats 
between the cells, causing the most damage to the protective barrier. "The 
stratum corneum tends to crack on people with dry skin, and evaporation occurs 
very quickly," Leyden says. New moisturizers such as Estee Lauder's Time Zone 
and Biotherm's Aqualogic are aimed at replenishing the fats, or lipids, to keep 
the stratum corneum intact. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to replace those lipids to help correct an abnormal outer layer 
of the skin," says Santa Monica dermatologist Nicholas Lowe, a professor at the 
UCLA School of Medicine. He notes that the test of an effective moisturizer is 
how long it keeps the skin moist: "A superior moisturizer can have a 
cumulative, more lasting effect than products that just sit on the skin, 
temporarily holding moisture in." 
</P>
<P>
"By 'regluing' those skin cells together, moisture stays in the skin where it 
belongs," says Walter Smith, Lauder senior vice president of research and 
development. "This keeps the stratum corneum in better condition, allowing it 
to get stronger over time, so you actually have long-term benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping skin soft and pliable is easier with lighter creams that can penetrate 
the stratum corneum and distribute proteins and fats throughout the protective 
layer. Old moisturizer formulas need to be viscous to support heavy fats and 
proteins, but new ones make use of ingredients whose smaller molecular 
structures allow them to be mixed with much lighter emollients. Some, such as 
Prescriptive's Simply Moisture and Rene Guinot's Hydrazone, are so light that 
manufacturers say even women with oily skin can use them without fear of 
clogging pores. 
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of winter, the season for peak moisturizer sales, Lowe 
suggests that consumers look for products that perform dual functions. "It's no 
longer enough for a product to be an effective moisturizer -- it should also 
contain a sunscreen," he says. Time Zone, Schering's Complex 15 and Stendahl's 
Hydro Extreme combine sun protection with moisturizing ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
So, while dermatologists could once recommend only messy petroleum jelly as an 
effective moisturizer, the list of alternatives has grown. "Today, many of the 
new products make logical sense," Elias says. "We've come a long way from 
Vaseline."

REACHING INTO AN assortment of pillowcases and wicker baskets, the Lizard Lady 
performs birthday magic: She keeps a party of 5-year-olds spellbound for an 
hour. Her traveling reptile repertoire includes Alana the Iguana, various 
skinks and snakes, and Bob the Tortoise, who may attempt to escape with all 
deliberate speed. 
</P>
<P>
A preschool teacher during the week, Melanie Bishop knows how to talk to kids, 
providing a running commentary on reptile habits. All of the children are 
allowed to touch her pets, but only the birthday child gets the privilege of 
holding them. 
</P>
<P>
But lest some of the young party guests feel left out, the Lizard Lady has one 
more surprise for the grand finale: Her name is Sheila, and she's an 8-foot 
python. Unlike the Lizard Lady's other reptiles, Sheila can be "worn" by one or 
more giggly kids (and adults). 
</P>
<P>
 Party rates are $125 and up. The Lizard Lady can be reached at (818) 781-8367.

Vroman's on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, which is near my home, and Fowler 
Brothers on 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles, which is near my office. 
Vroman's won a lasting gold star in my editor's heart in November, 1987, when 
it had, in stock, all five of the books nominated for the Los Angeles Times 
Book Prize in biography that year. 
</P>
<P>
Business at Fowler Brothers has been disrupted by the construction of the 7th 
Street subway, but Bob Manners of the trade books department and proprietor 
Sieg Lindstrom have a century of bookstore history behind them. Fowler 
Brothers, having survived worse, will surely survive the subway. 
</P>
<P>
Among specialist bookstores, Rizzoli's in Costa Mesa is admirable for the 
beauty of its art-book displays and small, elegant exhibit space. For 
children's books, I shop at San Marino Toy &amp; Book Shoppe (First Lady 
Barbara Bush recently invited proprietor Betty Takeuchi to the White House in 
connection with the Year of the Young Reader). 
</P>
<P>
And for pure fun, it is hard to top Bart's Books in Ojai. In this used-book 
emporium, an oak-shaded patio is enclosed by a maze of roofed bookshelves. The 
cheapest books are in the open shelves facing the street. (After-hours 
customers are instructed to throw their money into the patio.) There is also, 
however, a small inner sanctum with treasures for serious collectors and a 
glimpse of the book-cherishing spirit that makes this establishment possible.

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: STARS LENDING A HAND FOR AIDS BENEFIT IN PASADENA 
</P>

"I got ambitious," says impresario Alan Sievewright, a Scotsman who has been 
presenting opera and concerts in England for two decades, and will produce a 
gala benefit for the AIDS Hospice Foundation March 11 in Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Sievewright refers to the beginning of the second half of the ballet and opera 
program scheduled at the benefit. It will be nothing less than the opening of 
Act II of Wagner's "Die Walkure," with Rita Hunter as Brunnhilde and Louis 
Lebherz as Wotan. Scenery will be designed just for this event by David 
Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
"Every part of this gala will be staged and costumed," Sievewright promises. At 
the top of the show, for instance, the impresario says: "We will have Egyptian 
effects" for Martina Arroyo's singing of "Ritorna, vincitor," from "Aida.". 
</P>
<P>
And at the end of the first half, Hungarian soprano Sylvia Sass will be 
assisted by "16 actors, an executioner, plus Herod and Herodias," for the 
closing scene of Richard Strauss' "Salome." 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been able to lean on the stars," he commented in a phone 
interview. "But the logistics of putting on a benefit in Los Angeles are more 
complicated." He noted that the performers on March 11 will come from Denmark, 
Greece, Spain, Canada and England, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
They include: 
</P>
<P>
* Artistic director/dancer Peter Schaufuss and six dancers from his English 
National Ballet (formerly London Festival Ballet), who will dance in both 
halves of the program; in the second-half finale, Schaufuss, with a partner to 
be announced, will dance the Pas de Deux from "Don Quixote." 
</P>
<P>
* Spanish soprano Victoria de los Angeles, who will sing two arias from 
"Carmen." 
</P>
<P>
* English soprano Elizabeth Connell, who will sing the Letter Scene from 
Verdi's "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
* Canadian baritone Gino Quilico, who will sing the Largo al Factotum from 
Rossini's 'Barbiere di Siviglia." 
</P>
<P>
* Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis -- the 24-year-old protege of Carlo Bergonzi -- 
in his U.S. debut, who will sing an aria from "Andrea Chenier." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Jane Seymour, with Sievewright, will host the program. 
</P>
<P>
The impresario says he is not producing this gala evening all by himself. Among 
others he credits are Los Angeles Music Center Opera, which, he says, "has been 
most helpful. (General manager) Peter Hemmings is an old friend, from the days 
when I hired the London Symphony Orchestra for my opera concerts, when Peter 
was their manager." 
</P>
<P>
BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: The Hollywood Bowl Summer Festival 90 begins July 2 with the 
first of 39 performances by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The subscription 
season starts July 10 when American pianist Andre Watts performs Tchaikovsky's 
Concerto No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Projected highlights of the summer include appearances by conductor David 
Zinman and soprano Kathleen Battle in a program of Viennese music Aug. 3 and 4. 
Philharmonic Principal Guest Conductor Simon Rattle will conduct two programs 
of masterworks: Mahler's Symphony No. 2 ("Resurrection") and the Mendelssohn 
Violin Concerto Aug. 14, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 and Stravinsky's "Sacre 
du Printemps" Aug. 16. Three concerts by the visiting Seattle Symphony, led by 
its music director, Gerard Schwarz, will take place Aug. 23-25.

ON THE RECORD: CELEBRATING A NON-CELEBRITY QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quintets Mozart and Beethoven wrote for piano and winds are frequently 
recorded, inevitably appearing as a coupling. The Quintet in E-flat, K. 452, 
was a favorite of Mozart's among his own works (Beethoven's Opus 16, in the 
same key, is delightful but rather too obviously a knockoff) and it has proven 
attractive as a recording vehicle for celebrity pianists, among them Murray 
Perahia, Radu Lupu, Alfred Brendel, Andre Previn and James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not music frequently encountered in live circumstances since it 
is scored for winds rather than the usual string quartet. 
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned big names notwithstanding, the piece's manifold beauties are 
more consistently exhibited and its problems most successfully solved by a less 
starry pianist, Carol Rosenberger, within the context of stunningly 
accomplished work by present and former members of the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra: oboist Allan Vogel, clarinetist David Shifrin, bassoonist Kenneth 
Munday and hornist Robin Graham (Delos 3024). 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's most problematic writing occurs at the very outset, where the piano's 
bare chords, unsupported by sustained wind phrases, create wide-open spaces 
that cry out for ornamentation but receive it too cautiously or not at all from 
other interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger, through the simple expedient of arpeggiating those opening chords, 
allows the music to coalesce and take off, and when ornamentation is suggested, 
here and elsewhere in the score, she takes appropriate, tasteful advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But what Rosenberger offers isn't merely convincing from a musicological or 
structural standpoint. Her playing -- in both Mozart and Beethoven -- sparkles 
with wit and intelligence, as does that of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
While Brahms' Clarinet Quintet is hardly a stranger to our concert halls, one 
would be hard put to recall a live performance (perhaps even one on recordings) 
with the degree of thoughtfulness, warmth and ensemble polish shown in a new 
recorded version by David Shifrin and fellow members of Chamber Music 
Northwest, the annual event that makes Portland a summer paradise for 
aficionados of the intimate muse. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying work (on Delos 3066) is the less frequently encountered Brahms 
String Quintet in G, Opus 111. It is lamentable, considering the parade of 
string quartets to which we are annually treated in Southern California, that 
not one is ever sufficiently enterprising to add the second viola which would 
allow us to hear the small, choice repertory for string quintet. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the G-major Quartet is given a soaringly dramatic, songful reading 
here by the Chamber Music Northwest strings (all, in fact, New York-based): 
violinists Ani and Ida Kavafian, violists Walter Trampler and Steven Tenenbom, 
and cellist Fred Sherry, who with the exception of Tenenbom are also heard in 
the Clarinet Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's sole string quintet, in C, Opus 29, is neglected even on 
recordings, perhaps because "early Beethoven" is still regarded with 
insufficient seriousness by Romantically inclined interpreters and critics. Too 
bad, for Opus 29 is a beauty, dramatic and tuneful without the sweat and 
complexity of the late works. 
</P>
<P>
Its compact disc debut (Nimbus 5207) is energetically, if roughly presented by 
Britain's Medici Quartet and violist Simon Rowland Jones, but the coupling was 
ill-chosen: Beethoven's First "Rasumovsky" Quartet as part of the Medici's 
ongoing Beethoven quartet cycle. The competition here is overwhelming and the 
Medicis do not give the impression of being world class. 
</P>
<P>
One of the masterpieces of the tiny repertory of vocal chamber music is Ravel's 
"Chansons madecasses" for voice, flute, cello and piano and a midpriced re- 
release (Elektra/Nonesuch 71355) of the dozen-year-old recording featuring the 
late Jan DeGaetani serves as a fitting memorial to that treasurable artist. 
DeGaetani's coolly precise, soft-grained vocal delivery is strikingly 
contrasted to the exotically sexy lyrics, "collected and translated" by an 
18th-Century literary faker, the Vicomte de Parny, who in fact neither visited 
the land of their supposed origin, Madagascar, nor spoke its language. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the exceptionally attractive Ravel program is devoted to the 
Sonata for Violin and Cello (Isidore Cohen and Timothy Eddy, respectively) and 
a pair of rare two-piano pieces, "Sites auriculaires" and "Frontispice", 
enlisting the services of Gilbert Kalish, Teresa Sterne and the late Paul 
Jacobs.

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 DESERT ROSE BAND "PAGES OF LIFE" CURB/MCA: ALBUMS ARE

Is there a better country-rock band around today than Chris Hillman's? When you 
listen to the group's sure-footed third album, it's hard to think of any. As 
the title suggests, there is plenty of meaty material here. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it is pages of life, not the whole book, that the band addresses, 
and by keeping the focus tight, the album succeeds in tackling big issues in 
modest ways. Desert Rose supplies solace in both affirming word and uplifting 
music. Many of the songs spring from an understated foundation of Christian 
faith and underscore in various ways what may be the toughest problem facing 
the last decade of the 20th Century: hopelessness. "Darkness on the 
Playground," the album's gripping centerpiece, finds "There's trouble on the 
streets in this land of the free / Freedom has a price and you know it don't 
come cheap." The cure for such troubles, however, comes not from flight -- 
whether to an otherworldly spiritual nirvana or into drugs or even fame -- but 
by facing life's travails squarely and gaining the strength that comes only 
through such challenges. RANDY LEWIS

RECORD RACK: *** THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS "FLOOD" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A

And they might be big-time now that they're on a major label. Then again, 
probably not. This third Giant effort from the New Jersey duo is quite like the 
iconoclastic, independent gems that preceded it, full of socio-romantic musings 
disguised as absurdist, minimalist, Dada demo-rock, not to mentionample, 
accordion-accompanied power pop helpings of humorously opaque symbolism . . . 
sorta like Joseph Campbell meets Weird Al Yankovic. 
</P>
<P>
Public radio programmers, repentant intellectuals and very small children 
should all love it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights (and among the four tracks produced by Clive Langer and 
Alan Winstanley, with only slightly more instrumentation than usual): a revival 
of the Four Lads' 1953 novelty "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)," a pointless 
musing on cities' changing names that sounds like something drunkards might 
sing in unison in a beer hall, if their lips could move that fast; and, more 
seriously, "Your Racist Friend," an instant classic about suffering the idiocy 
of fools for the sake of third parties. 
</P>
<P>
Manic and deadpan whiny, They Might Be Giants aren't about to escape the 
dreaded onus of novelty act with this brisk 19-ditty album, but geez, with 
titles like "Someone Keeps Moving My Chair" (which is less easy to dissect than 
it sounds) and the soon-to-be-a-college-radio-standard "Birdhouse in Your 
Soul," they do still really bring it on themselves -- thank goodness. CHRIS

INTRODUCING: SARA HICKMAN'S DOWN-HOME IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Artist: Sara Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
History: Born in Jacksonville, N.C., and raised in Houston, Hickman, 26, took 
something of a humorous, performance-art approach to music while studying fine 
arts in college at Denton, Tex. After graduation in 1987, she moved to Dallas 
and became a regular in the local clubs with shows described by the Dallas 
Times-Herald as "a cross between a stand-up comedy routine and group therapy, 
with great music thrown in as a bonus." The Dallas Observer named her the 
city's best solo performer and best folk act of 1988. Carl Finch of polka-rock 
band Brave Combo saw her perform on a local cable television show and offered 
to co-produce a debut album, "Equal Scary People," which his group's Four Dots 
label released in early '89. The record took the Observer's 1989 best 
independent album award, while Hickman won as best acoustic/folk act and placed 
second behind Edie Brickell as best female vocalist and best songwriter. 
Windham Hill records included her song "Salvador" (an ode to Salvador Dali) in 
its "Legacy" anthology of new folk artists, and Hickman then signed with 
Elektra, which re-released "Equal Scary People" last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: The wacky, garishly toothy cover illustration of Hickman on the album is 
a tip-off that she doesn't belong in the same category with with such 
straightforwardly earnest female folkies as Brickell and the Indigo Girls. 
Instead, she offers a hip but down-home, honest but irony-laden mix that fans 
of Michelle Shocked and k.d. lang should relate to just fine. "Equal Scary 
People" is an album full of winks, nudges and tickles, but Hickman also 
prominently displays soul inclinations that blend nicely with country 
influences in the arrangements of such songs as "500X (The Train Song)," a new 
take on the old railroad/sex metaphor. And there's also soul in her voice, 
which helps make an effectively deadpan folk delivery of James Brown's "It's a 
Man's World" more than just a cute feminist twist. For that, though, there's a 
campy rumba of Little Peggy March's "I Wish I Were a Princess."

ON THE OFFBEAT: WORLD BEAT COLLECTIONS -- STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quiz time: What do the major pop music styles of Colombia sound like? 
</P>
<P>
Who are the big names on the Kenyan pop scene these days? 
</P>
<P>
What exactly is Bhangra pop, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Most pop music fans don't exactly have those answers on the tip of their 
tongues. But adventurous listeners could find out by checking into the various 
artist compilations that are the focus of this edition of "On the Offbeat," a 
periodic review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
Those samplers are often perfect for finding out if a particular style or the 
music of a certain country or region hits the spot. It's possible to explore 
the historical roots of a contemporary style or discover a favorite label, 
producer, or crack team of session musicians to keep tabs on. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the unknown artists who unexpectedly pop up. Take the "Nairobi 
Beat" album -- the Maroon Commandos were an unknown quantity but "Amua 
Nikuiachie Kazi" certainly whets the appetite for more from the Kenyan Army's 
7th Battalion band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIAN "Cumbias Y Gaitas Famosas de Colombia, Vols. 1-3" Discos Fuentes 
(Colombian imports) "Fiesta Vallenata" Shanachie 
</P>
<P>
Typical -- no one paid any attention to Colombian pop music for years and 
suddenly records are all over the place. "Fiesta Vallenata," part of 
Shanachie's exemplary World Beat/Ethno Pop series, focuses on the 
accordion-driven regional style from Colombia's Caribbean coast. The sprightly 
sound, with swirling accordion lines, propulsive percussion and often wild bass 
lines that obey a crazed logic of their own, has much of the festive flavor of 
norteno music. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cumbias Y Gaitas" series is more intriguing. Volume 3 is split evenly 
between the two styles -- cumbias, the major indigenous rhythm developed in 
Columbia, dominates its slightly more upbeat gaita offspring on the other 
collections. The tracks probably date from the late '50s or early '60s -- some 
have a loopy energy and percussive undertow redolent of Jamaican ska and others 
a big band sound evoking images of a Ricky Ricardo-style conga line snaking 
around the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
It's vibrant dance music featuring anything from accordion and blowsy trombones 
to high-flying clarinets and a raucous electric rhythm guitar on "La 
Magadalena." Vocal tracks are featured on Vol. 1, instrumentals prevail on the 
other two albums and Volume 2 emerges as the best single collection courtesy of 
its powerful opening punch of "Cumbia Cienaguera," "Cumbia Campesina," and "La 
Magdalena." But grab any you see -- Discos Fuentes reportedly stopped selling 
these albums overseas to focus attention on more recent releases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFRICAN "The Nairobi Beat: Kenyan Pop Music Today" Rounder 
</P>
<P>
A professor of cultural anthropology compiled this collection and most of the 
first side sounds like it. The music may be representative of Kenyan pop styles 
-- which echo the lightly textured, multiple guitar sound of the popular 
Zairian sound -- but the clinical performances lack the sparkle and excitement 
pop fans cherish. 
</P>
<P>
That lasts until the Maroon Commandos kick into 8 1/2 minutes of biting 
guitars, evocatively rough vocals and delightful horns that unexpectedly enter 
halfway through the arrangement. "The Nairobi Beat" never loses that momentum, 
with particularly strong performances by the Gatundu Boys and the Mayanja 
Bungoma Jazz Band standing out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICAN "We Got Latin Soul," "Latino Club!" Caliente/Charly (UK imports) 
</P>
<P>
The Latin pop/salsa spectrum has received short shrift in the world music surge 
but now Charly -- the English label whose blues/soul/R&amp;B re-issues have 
been invaluable -- has inaugurated its Caliente subsidiary. "Latin Soul" 
focuses on material from the '60s, when Ray Barretto's "El Watusi" and Joe 
Cuba's "Bang Bang" hit the pop charts with a compact riff/hook, vocal chant and 
percussion break format. "Latino Club!" was assembled by British club deejays 
and features '70s material more oriented toward instrumental solos flashing 
over potent dance grooves. Both are solid -- the choice really boils down to 
individual preference for tight songs or more expansive instrumental work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CARIBBEAN "Port of Spain Shuffle," "Caribbean Connections" New Cross (UK 
import) 
</P>
<P>
These volumes capture the West Indian calypso performers, including the notable 
veterans Lord Kitchener and Lord Beginner, who adapted their sunny, tropical 
sound and topical commentary to life in Great Britain after migrating there in 
the late '40s and early '50s. Despite such well-known tracks as Lion's "Ugly 
Woman" and the original of "Man Smart and Woman Smarter" (recorded by Robert 
Palmer years ago), "Port of Spain Shuffle" is weaker. The old-timey flavor of 
the arrangements suffer in contrast with the snappier, jazz-infused music on 
"Caribbean Connections." Some highlights there: "Nora, I Will Die a Bachelor," 
and "Calypso Be," Young Tiger's articulately stated put-down of the be-bop 
brigade.

ALFREDO JAAR'S MINIMALISM-INFLUENCED SHOW AT LA JOLLA ATTACKS WESTERN 
STEREOTYPES

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some pictures can be traced to the eye and mind of an individual artist, but 
other powerful images are created by whole societies. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, for example, the Third World. The picture that forms in your mind is 
likely a composite that has been assembled, consciously or not, from bits and 
pieces generated by all manner of sources: newspaper stories, television 
documentaries, overheard conversations, personal experiences, books, Hollywood 
movies and more. Like a Picasso collage, the image is a potent fiction cobbled 
together from a diverse array of longstanding traditions, some newly crafted 
illusions and even a few assorted fragments of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all its multiplicity of sources, and for all the variations rightly 
claimed by individuals with differing conceptions of the same subject, pictures 
created by whole societies are still characterized by a singular perspective. 
The developing nations of the so-called Third World are "third" only from the 
perspective of the technologically complex First World, which drew the picture 
and coined the term. It's an image "we" have painted to describe "them." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Jaar is an artist who, in his own work, tries to drive a wedge into 
whatever narrow cracks and fissures he can find in such stubborn and deceptive 
pictures. Beginning with a notable entry at the 1986 Venice Biennale, his 
installations featuring large, color transparencies mounted on fluorescent 
light-boxes have been the subject of steadily increasing attention. Born in 
Santiago, Chile, in 1956, and resident in New York City for most of the last 
decade, Jaar is surely in a position to have become keenly aware of assorted 
gruesome dissonances. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of a dozen pieces dating from 1986 to 1990 -- Jaar's first 
substantive presentation in Southern California -- opened last week at the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, where it will remain on view through April 1. 
The work is decidedly uneven. Yet Jaar is clearly wading through a largely 
uncharted territory that is of unusual significance to the present moment. 
Aspects of his endeavor suffer from a surfeit of earnestness that conflicts 
with an occasionally sleek, vaguely designerish manner of presentation; but 
other qualities possess the capacity to make fluid a variety of sluggish, 
congealed assumptions. Jaar's is an art that compels notice through the sheer 
ambitiousness evident in his project. 
</P>
<P>
The format of Jaar's art reflects the twin poles of his academic background. 
After first studying documentary film making at Santiago's Chilean-North 
American Institute of Culture, he pursued a degree in architecture at the 
city's University of Chile. Today, his art is chiefly composed of documentary 
photographs -- some made by Jaar, others found in published sources -- which 
are displayed in relation to architecturally based sculptural forms that owe 
more than just a formal debt to the geometries of Minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
As disciplines, architecture and documentary photography might seem to be 
wildly divergent; in substance and material, obviously they are. Conceptually, 
however, the two share something fundamental: a sharp awareness of the 
complexities of social relationships, which is the subject of Jaar's art. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Museum, curator Madeleine Grynsztejn has used the 1986 
installation Jaar showed at the Venice Biennale as the touchstone for the 
exhibition, which is otherwise composed of more recent work. Now part of the 
museum's permanent collection, and the single finest work in the show, "Gold in 
the Morning" is composed of several elements dispersed around a darkened 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Jaar spent several months photographing among the 40,000 laborers in Serra 
Pelada (Naked Hill), a huge, open-pit gold mine in a remote corner of Brazil's 
Amazon rain forest. Winnowing the thousands of pictures into a selection of 
just five, the artist skillfully chose images that show a surprisingly wide 
range of viewpoints: the enormity of the site and the resulting anonymity of 
the labor force; the human specificity of individual workers; the mythic and 
metaphoric power associated with the metal being mined; the brute, physical 
power required to do the work; the utterly mundane social interactions among 
miners; the fragmentary nature of every documentary enterprise, including this 
one; and more. 
</P>
<P>
Any pretense that the photographer is a neutral and invisible eye is erased by 
a prominently placed picture of a group of miners playfully mugging for the 
camera. In an important way, what we are seeing is honestly declared to be a 
performance orchestrated by the artist. He inserts himself, however indirectly, 
into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
These five color photographs have been made into large transparencies, several 
feet square, and each is mounted on a light-box that uses fluorescent bulbs to 
illuminate the image from behind. Four are paired with like-size metal boxes 
painted gold; the L-shaped displays that result have been installed at the 
junctures of the gallery's walls, floor and ceiling -- any 
</P>
<P>
where but flat on the wall at typical eye level. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth light-box is a free-standing module, placed on the floor as a kind of 
headstone behind a large, ornate, gilded picture frame that lies atop a bed of 
nails. The nails inside the frame are painted gold, those outside are not. 
</P>
<P>
In this and other installations, Jaar has sought to bridge the wide material 
gap between architecture and documentary photography through a knowing 
invocation of Minimalist form. The elegant, lacquered boxes of "Gold in the 
Morning" put you in mind of sculptures by Donald Judd, while the fluorescent 
lights recall the trademark material used by Dan Flavin. It's a canny choice, 
because Minimalism shares with Jaar's other interests an emphasis on the social 
dimension in which art is experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Minimalist sculptors in the 1960s began to shift a viewer's attention away from 
solitary interaction with discrete sculptural objects. Instead, they wanted to 
articulate the cultural context within which such interactions take place. 
Among the ways in which the feat was accomplished was the wholesale banishment 
of the pedestal -- a primary device of Western culture by which sculpture had 
been elevated from the realm of the everyday and sent aloft into a hallowed 
space called High Art. Minimalism got sculpture down onto the floor, and 
sometimes even into and under it. 
</P>
<P>
With strategies such as this, Minimalism harbored a profoundly political 
dimension. For all the abstract geometry of its forms, this was an art that 
insisted you be aware of the factors through which a society makes art a 
powerful and privileged activity. The passive viewer was subtly transformed 
into an active and inquiring spectator, who shared a real and distinctly social 
space with the work of art. 
</P>
<P>
Jaar's placement of his illuminated pictures anywhere but at typical eye level 
on the wall is an extrapolation of the pedestal-banishing formal device central 
to the achievement of Minimalist sculpture. He displaces his pictures from 
ordinary view, then seamlessly integrates them within the actual architecture 
of the room -- a method that may also owe something to the elaborate decoration 
of Spanish Baroque churches in colonial Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of artists in recent years, Jaar has married this philosophical 
implication of Minimalist form to frankly political subject matter. "Gold in 
the Morning" invokes the long history of colonization, which counts among its 
most recent incarnations the very idea of a Third World. Today, debate centers 
on whether First World countries now colonize Third World countries not with 
explorers, invading armies or occupying settlers, but simply through 
long-distance control over international currency and trading. The precious 
gold at Serra Pelada, said to be the richest strike anywhere in the 20th 
Century, is aggressively being mined to pay off Brazil's massive foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
The open-pit miners are simultaneously digging themselves out of a hole and 
into a hole. As in the fine 1989 work called "Coyote!," in which a St. 
Christopher-like figure carries a veiled illegal alien across the Rio Grande, 
religious allusions to crucifixion, sainthood, life after death and other 
Catholic iconography abound. Set before a mound of nails topped by a gilded 
frame, Jaar's funerary headstone suggests that digging is these peoples' life, 
and they are digging their own collective grave. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold in the Morning," "Coyote!" and a triptych called "1+1+1" are resonant 
works, but there are decided weaknesses to Jaar's approach. The transparencies 
are in color, but they are not colorful. Relying on a golden range of sepia 
tones, Jaar blessedly avoids the look of a travelogue or National Geographic 
layout, but at the expense of a certain blandness and redundancy. Dull 
didacticism, too, is a constant threat not always avoided. 
</P>
<P>
More damagingly, the Minimalist-inspired fusion of architecture and documentary 
photography in his light-boxes bears an inescapable visual similarity to 
advertising displays at bus-stop shelters, airport lounges and shopping malls 
-- situations in which cliche is king. Jaar frequently embraces the trite 
slogan, as in the groan-inducing relationship created between photographs of 
marginalized people and their placement in the out-of-the-way margins of the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
At 33, however, the artist has established a solid and provocative base. 
Colonization is hardly new -- the Phoenicians got the ball rolling in the 
ancient Mediterranean world, and it hasn't stopped since -- but European and 
North American colonialism are virtually inseparable from the modern world. Now 
that modernism has become the subject of cultural scrutiny, and as questions of 
the social relationships between so-called First and Third worlds are pressed, 
Alfredo Jaar is clearly mining volatile and important territory. 
</P>
<P>
The native Chilean's photographs document life in a Brazilian mine and other 
harsh realities of the poor.

The Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies is no longer homeless. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, LACPS opens its new downtown gallery space -- the organization's 
first home in two years -- with an inaugural exhibition featuring photographic 
installations by Los Angeles artists Kim Yasuda and Jody Zellen, and 
large-scale photographic mixed-media pieces by the collaborative team of Todd 
Gray and Stephan Reusse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big step for us," said LACPS Director Suzy Kerr, who explained that 
the nonprofit organization has been working to establish a permanent home since 
1988, when it received a $25,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant for that 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said that up until now, the organization has been operating out of an 
office located in the same building as the new gallery, and has held its 
programs -- including exhibitions, lectures and workshops -- in other venues, 
such as Beyond Baroque, the Fullerton Museum Center and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said that while the organization still will continue to collaborate with 
other locations and venues for its larger exhibitions, the new gallery will be 
used to show "local artists doing emerging work." 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky to get it," said Kerr of the 350-square-foot space, which she 
described as "more of a small, New York-style gallery space than a Los Angeles 
gallery space." Located at 1048 W. 6th St., the 35x11-foot gallery, which 
formerly housed a sign shop, was redesigned by architect and LACPS board member 
Josh Schweitzer, and contains a large store-front window facing out to 6th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said that she had been too "overwhelmed" with finishing the physical work 
necessary for the gallery's opening to set many future programing details, but 
that the gallery's second show, to open in late March, will feature the work of 
photographer Pat Ward Williams. Programing decisions beyond that, she said, 
will be made by LACPS' newly formed program committee, chaired by local artist 
Daniel Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to put out a call for entries and suggestions. We want to make 
this space as open as possible to the community . . . so we want to work on a 
fairly spontaneous basis," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the new home is certainly a step forward, it isn't the last for 
LACPS, which was formed in 1974 to encourage the growth and appreciation of 
photography as an art form. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to move again in a couple of years to a larger, better, permanent 
home," said Kerr, noting that the organization's ultimate goal is to have a 
300,000-square-foot gallery space in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, Kerr said she expects more than 300 people to attend 
the gallery's opening on Saturday. In addition to the regular gallery opening, 
the organization will throw a $10-per-person party from 7-10 p.m. in the 
building's 10th floor penthouse. The local band Gutbucket will perform. 
</P>
<P>
The Yasuda, Zellen and Grey and Reusse works will remain on view through March 
9. 
</P>
<P>
CALL FOR ENTRIES: Long Beach's Public Corporation for the Arts will accept 
slide entries for the city's fifth annual Art Expedition poster through 
Thursday. To qualify, entrants must live and produce their work in the city of 
Long Beach, must have been working as a professional artist for at least three 
years and must already belong to or be ready to join the PCA's Visual Arts 
Registry. For information, call Mary Sullivan at (213) 499-7777. 
</P>
<P>
Also accepting entries is the Downey Museum of Art, which is preparing for its 
March 22-May 6 "Ceramics Now: 1990" show. For consideration, artists must 
submit slides by Feb. 14. The competition is open to all artists working in 
ceramics, and the museum is seeking work that is representative of current 
trends in the medium. For information, call (213) 861-0419.

NOTES: The Norton Simon Museum of Art has added Gustave Courbet's early 
portrait, "Peasant Girl with a Scarf," to its collections. The portrait of a 
young peasant woman wearing a checked cotton scarf was painted about 1848, 
during the first decade of the artist's maturity. . . . Noted Mexican 
photographer Graciela Iturbide, whose first solo museum show in the U.S., 
"External Encounters, Internal Imaginings: Photographs by Graciela Iturbide," 
is currently at the San Francisco Museum of Art, will present a free slide 
lecture on Feb. 8 at 7:30 p.m. at San Francisco's Mission Cultural Center, 2868 
Mission St. Iturbide will discuss -- in Spanish and accompanied by an English 
translator -- her experiences as a photographer working in Mexico and the 
United States. . . . Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, the Los Angeles 
Center for Photographic Studies, and the Downey Museum of Art are among 23 arts 
institutions receiving matching grants through the National/State/County 
Partnership. LACE will receive $10,000; LACPS $5,000 and the Downey Museum 
$2,500. The grants recognize "significant contributions being made by emerging 
and innovative organizations."

'WHY IS IT THAT THE POP CRITICAL ESTABLISHMENT HAS TURNED INTO A STRONGHOLD FOR 
PRETENSE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll started out as a protest against pretense and stuffiness -- pure 
vitality and good fun, along with moments of emotional uplift and tenderness: 
Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Roy Orbison, the Everly 
Brothers. The Beatles, with their good humor, tender ballads and rhythmic 
vitality, continued that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that the pop critical establishment has turned into a stronghold for 
pretense -- both a humorless intellectual pretense (suicidally bleak lyrics are 
a requirement) and an insecure machismo pretense? 
</P>
<P>
Music must be loud and unmelodic. And to like rock with melodic structure, or 
rock full of vitality and fun or, God forbid, a ballad, is an unforgivable sign 
of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Good rock these days is still a protest against pretense -- but now, 
paradoxically, a protest against the self-importance of rock critics; that is 
why Billy Joel's superb "Storm Front" was on Pop Eye's Jan. 14 list of the 
worst albums of 1989. 
</P>

 The Pop Eye list was the result of a poll taken among 40 writers, critics, 
deejays, record executives, managers, musicians and fans. Joel's album was in 
ninth place.

SUPPORT FOR GAY STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Ray Loynd's Jan. 7 article "Where Does Gay Theatre Go From Here?" he point 
out that gay males and lesbians have a poor record supporting each other's 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
As executive producer of San Diego's most recent entry, a new musical comedy, 
"O'Mary's," I can vouch for that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Although we made the fatal mistake of relying too heavily on ticket sales from 
this market segment, we were frankly appalled at how few gay men and women 
showed any interest at our gay-themed upbeat messages for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they not buy tickets, but they failed to show even after a 
concerted effort to host their attendance! 
</P>
<P>
"O'Mary's" has sold to and been attended by primarily heterosexual mainstream 
theatergoers -- lots of seniors!

SECRET INGREDIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "The Revenge of Successful Sitcoms," Jan. 14, by Steve 
Weinstein: 
</P>
<P>
Regarding TV producer Bob Boyett's comment that he and partner Tom Miller "want 
a certain amount of nurturing people, a certain amount of women and older 
people (on their sitcom staffs)," may I suggest that in his next interview he 
refrain from referring to women and people over 35 as some kind of secret 
ingredient in their sitcom stew. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of coming across as the open-minded, family-loving fellows they claim 
to be, Boyett and Miller sure sound like just another pair of sexist, ageist 
Hollywood producers to me.

JAPANESE ORIGINALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's tiring to hear it over and over again, but even more irritating having to 
read it in a newspaper. I'm speaking of J. Gregory Keene's Jan. 14 letter on 
the recent acquisition of Columbia by Sony in which he writes ". . . the 
Japanese have created nothing original." 
</P>
<P>
Either he is ignorant of or conveniently overlooks original efforts of 
directors such as Akira Kurosawa and multitalent legends such as 
actor/playwright/novelist Mishima in his rush to spew forth jingoistic bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate, perhaps, that the United States is blessed with the more 
enlightened views of George Lukas, Paul Schrader and Francis Ford Coppola, who 
have all claimed inspiration from these Japanese originals. It gives the rest 
of us hope that Mr. Keene's parroting of the same old generalization about 
other cultures remain only in the provincial minds of a handful of bitter, 
unoriginal thinkers.

Jeff Vande Wege, whose Jan. 7 letter complains about a Lawrence Christon 
article, has it absolutely wrong, though his is, I'm afraid, an increasingly 
prevalent viewpoint. It isn't The Times' fault that Mr. Vande Wege wasn't 
paying attention in school or didn't consult a dictionary when he first he 
heard the words acedia, mediagenic and pusillanimity. 
</P>
<P>
The only criterion for use of any word, obscure or just uncommon, should be 
that it is properly invoked. When I come across a word with which I am 
unfamiliar -- something which happens many times each week -- I grab the 
dictionary that I always keep within reach while thinking how much I appreciate 
the writer for exposing me to another previously unlearned aspect of our 
remarkably rich language. 
</P>
<P>
Please, please, don't ever dumb-down The Times just to placate those who are 
intellectually lazy. If this publication is, as Mr. Vande Wege says, too 
"exacting" for him, may I suggest USA Today, or perhaps My Weekly Reader?

SUPPORT FOR GAY STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been involved in lesbian theater in L.A. as an actor and producer since 
1986 and I can't figure out on what basis Loynd describes lesbian drama as 
"most often dealing with loneliness, jealousies and fears." Some plays that do 
not fit that category are L.S. Elliot's farce "Met My Match," Sarah Dreher's 
"Alumnae News" and Bia Lowe's "All About Betty," all enjoying successful runs 
in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Lesbians wouldn't have to "claw for recognition" if members of the white, male 
press (such as Mr. Loynd) did their homework. I mean, how many lesbians did 
Loynd poll to determine that we are "satisfied with our gay sisterhood forum"? 
I would disagree with that statement if I knew what it meant.

MALATHION OPTIONS NEED BE FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER GREEN, Peter Green is a biology instructor at Golden West College and 
mayor pro tem of the City of Huntington Beach, which was targeted last week for 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerial spraying of malathion in Orange County is expected to increase in 
frequency and area in the coming months, as efforts continue to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. With the introduction of malathion into our 
environment come questions, some of which I will try, as a scientist and public 
official, to answer. 
</P>
<P>
What Is Malathion? 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is an organophosphate, one of a group of chemicals that functions by 
blocking nerve impulses -- in other words, a nerve gas. In 1962, biologist and 
writer Rachel Carson pointed out that malathion is considered a less toxic 
compound because it can be detoxified by a liver enzyme. However, in 1984 James 
Warf reported that each exposure to malathion reduces the body's ability to 
detoxify it. And, even before that, in 1969, the U.S. Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare warned that "skin penetration by organophosphates may be 
substantial. In view of the toxic potential of these compounds, protection of 
workers exposed to them assumes the utmost importance." 
</P>
<P>
Does Malathion Cause Birth Defects? 
</P>
<P>
When malathion was injected into the yolk sac of fertile bird eggs prior to 
incubation as a test of toxicity, there was "not only a low percentage of hatch 
at a low level of the chemical tested, but there are also congenital 
abnormalities and other responses that raise extremely serious questions as to 
the safety to the consumers of any food contaminated with these chemicals," 
Joseph McLaughlin reported in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Does Malathion Cause Cancer? 
</P>
<P>
Cancer researcher Melvin Reuber, in reviewing the scientific literature on the 
carcinogenicity and toxicity of malathion in 1984, reported that cancerous 
growths on the endocrine organs, brain and liver, as well as ulcers, chronic 
renal disease and atrophy of the testes in laboratory rats had been reported. 
He observed that, "in tests undertaken to date, it has been demonstrated that 
virtually every chemical which has been found to be carcinogenic in humans is 
also carcinogenic in one or more mammalian test animals." 
</P>
<P>
Does Malathion Affect Other Living Organisms? 
</P>
<P>
After the 1981-82 aerial eradication program in Santa Clara County, gardens in 
the area sprayed with malathion had more white flies, aphids and mites than did 
unsprayed gardens. Steve Dreistat and Donald Dahlsten, writing in the 
scientific publication Environment in 1986, observed that, "Malathion-bait 
sprays adversely affect pollinators such as honey bees. . . . Malathion is 
highly toxic to aquatic organisms -- approximately 2,000 mosquito fish 
(gambusia) in Mission Creek were killed." It should be noted that the Orange 
County Vector Control District stocks flood control channels with these fish to 
control mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Is Malathion Harmless at the Concentration Used in Spraying? 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marc Lappe, the principal author of the 1980 California Department of 
Health Services report "Assessment of Health Risks From the Proposed Aerial 
Application of Malathion in Santa Clara County," refused to sign the final 
version, charging that it misrepresented his findings. "Various studies have 
suggested several potential adverse chronic health effects from exposure to 
malathion. These risks include birth defects, induction of genetic changes in 
germ cells and, perhaps, long-term effects on the nervous system. To my 
knowledge, none of this information has been made available to the public -- I 
have never reached a decision as to what a safe exposure level is. For these 
same reasons, the World Health Organization declined to set a 'safe' limit for 
malathion in occupation settings. There have been omissions in the testing of 
this pesticide, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 
recognizing that fact, has ordered further studies concerning the long-term 
chronic effect of malathion exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Are There Other Means by Which the Medfly Can Be Controlled? 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1 million insect species, and about 100 of those cause 90% of 
the damage to food crops. The ideal method of control affects only the target 
insect species, and a number of such controls are available. Sterile male fruit 
flies are being released, and that number should be increased. Chemical sex 
attractants are now available commercially for 30 major insect pests, including 
Japanese beetles. Such species-specific chemical attractants, or pheromones, 
should be developed for the Medfly. Other biological controls could include the 
introduction of predators, pathogens, parasites or viruses that affect the 
Medfly. Basic research in entomology should be initiated or accelerated by the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a program of education that emphasizes personal responsibility for 
limiting the spread of the Medfly should be initiated immediately. Local 
elected officials, the Orange County Agriculture Department and the State 
Department of Food and Agriculture must cooperate with citizens of Orange 
County in this effort.

POLITICIANS, TAX HIKES AND GAS TAX MEASURES

<TEXT>
<P>
It is time to say no to more than just drugs! On Jan. 1, Social Security taxes 
increased a hefty 15.3%. Willie Brown is proposing that the temporary 
quarter-cent earthquake tax be made permanent, as though that should come as a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6 we will be asked to vote for a 100% increase in the state gasoline 
tax, from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
After the Orange County voters overwhelmingly turned down a sales tax increase 
called Prop. A, the officials came back with a $2.5-million-plus campaign to 
try and sell one more increase called Measure M. The ink is hardly dry from the 
reports of that defeat, and here they are coming back to the trough one more 
time and proposing one more vote on the same twice-defeated tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
This time every voter should get out and leave little doubt in these 
non-representative official minds that no means no!

MALATHION SPRAYING AND CANCER RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state and county authorities need to stop the malathion spraying program 
immediately in Orange County! 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the technical and medical questions about the efficacy of 
malathion spraying and the short-term and long-term medical impacts, hundreds 
of thousands of citizens, taxpayers and residents of central Orange County are 
being needlessly put at risk and put money out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
What is the rush to spray? Why not try the equally effective methods of 
biological control (sterile male flies) and physical control (tree stripping, 
quarantines, etc.)? 
</P>
<P>
Why are our state and county authorities afraid of open public hearings and an 
honest independent review of this program? Why do we have a "state of 
emergency" for a problem we have had for 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
Why are we so intent on preserving the profits of the agricultural chemical 
companies and the large corporate farming interests that we brush aside all 
local opposition and put down all independent authorities? 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly is apparently here to stay. Let's establish a long-term biological 
control program that will keep the pest population in reasonable control. Let's 
not endanger the lives, safety and well-being of hundreds of thousands of 
Orange County residents.

It is apparent that Gov. Deukmejian and all Orange County supervisors (except 
Roger R. Stanton, who has voted against spraying) have all taken the position 
that the threat of the Medfly to the crops creates a state of emergency and 
that to protect the crops, malathion spraying is necessary and safe. They share 
one thing in common -- none of them, nor their families, are being sprayed to 
test its safety. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has not as yet determined that malathion spraying is safe for human 
beings or our water supply. 
</P>
<P>
I took my grandchildren out of the Garden Grove spray area last Thursday night. 
I would invite the governor and the supervisors who say that it is safe, to 
bring their children, grandchildren, and pregnant family members to stay at my 
home during the repeated Garden Grove sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
I am a physician who has studied the data, and I can state unequivocally that 
the safety of the spraying has not been established and that malathion may be 
very dangerous. There are also much safer alternatives to combat the Medfly, 
such as the release of sterile Medflies. That method would be more expensive 
but is not a threat to people or our water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Our elected officials are putting our children at risk and they and their 
families have nothing at stake. That's a travesty.

OPOSSUMS UNDER AND IN THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Playing Possums: They're Not Serious" (Jan. 2): I chuckled last year as 
momma opossum strolled along our block wall fence, laden with her burden of 
seven babies on her back, (and I) called the grandchildren to hurry, come and 
see the opossums. How cute. We even named the little critters, and they became 
a topic at social occasions. Winston and Winchell and the rest of the gang were 
growing as they visited most every night to see if there were any good morsels 
in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
Then I moved down the street a few houses into a larger place with hardwood 
floors and a crawl space under the house. The first night I saw a rather large 
opossum stroll down the front walk like he owned the place. I thought, how 
cute; I wonder if this critter was our grown-up Winston or Winchell or one of 
the brothers or sisters from momma's large litter of last year? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the opossums ceased to be cute when the weather grew cold and they 
proceeded to set up housekeeping under the house, next to the heater. And last 
week, one of the opossums decided it wasn't warm enough down there and decided 
to come in the house at 11:30 p.m. via the clean-out access for the bathtub in 
the utility room.

Suddenly this was a very active household as Winston, Winchell or Minerva 
decided to come out from behind the washer and see what could be midnight snack 
in the nearby trash. After a harrowing 30 minutes on top of the washer in my 
nightie convincing the menacing, snapping, loudly insulted opossum back into 
the hole it had so rudely entered by and blocking it up with enough wood to 
keep Gen. Sherman's cavalry out, we attempted to contact Orange County Animal 
Control and our landlord to see how to remove our unwanted friends. 
</P>
<P>
You are right, Animal Control wants nothing to do with removing the opossums. 
They did send the landlord plans to build a cage to catch the opossums, so we 
can call Animal Control to come and pick them up and, I quote from your 
article: "The county policy is to release the captured animal in the same 
general area where found." Really! 
</P>
<P>
Is the county afraid to break up that "old gang of mine?" In the meantime, I 
have an unknown number of opossums residing under the house, making noise if we 
make too much noise, the possibility of germs, fleas, breeding, biting one of 
my grandchildren, and now the knowledge that if I do happen to catch one of 
them, it will be returned to the same general area where it was captured. 
</P>
<P>
Think of it, if momma has seven more babies this year and each of her last 
year's litter has seven babies each, add the big (poppa) that started it all 
and we could conceivably have 100 opossums on our block this year. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many are living at the next door neighbor's.

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, AVIATOR EDDIE MARTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort at internal admiration, a member of the County Board of 
Supervisors has suggested naming the terminal after one of its members. 
</P>
<P>
The terminal could be named John Wayne Terminal if John Wayne's name is taken 
off the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is no need for a name on the terminal. If the name of the 
airport is Orange County, then the terminal is Orange County Airport Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to stop all the confusion and misconceptions that were created 
by the addition of the name John Wayne. At the time John Wayne's name was 
adopted by the Board of Supervisors, there was no prior research study done, 
nor any staff report heard, no committee was appointed, no notice was given to 
the public and it was not even placed on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot of opposition voiced against the name John Wayne at that time, 
and over the years, the board has been approached by a lot of people to change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Please note that John Wayne only acted out the hero in many movies. As for Tom 
Riley, it is during his tenure that we in Orange County went from a livable 
surrounding to a congested, smoggy and less pleasant area without enough roads 
and airports and now an airport terminal on the wrong side of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Let's wait 100 years to see if anyone is worthy of having his name placed on 
top of an airport building. For now, it definitively should be called only 
"Orange County/SNA Terminal."

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, AVIATOR EDDIE MARTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1974 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley was appointed to the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors for the 5th District, which happens to have an airport within its 
boundaries. Since his first day on the job, Riley has been deeply involved in 
both making the airport a good neighbor and meeting the vital needs of air 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Riley's leadership made the settlement agreement with the city of 
Newport a reality. This action permitted the current needed improvements at the 
airport. In short, he has truly earned the recognition suggested in our letter 
to the county board that would name the new terminal at John Wayne Airport the 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Some have said the terminal should bear the name of aviation pioneer Eddie 
Martin because his contributions to aviation in the county are well known. The 
present terminal was named The Eddie Martin Terminal in 1989, and will be used 
for general aviation activities upon opening of the new terminal. General 
aviation, of course, was and is Eddie's first love and this recognition seems 
appropriate. Contrary to rumors, the Eddie Martin Terminal is not slated for 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these men deserve a place in the history of air transportation in 
Orange County and we believe the recognition suggested would properly honor 
Thomas F. Riley for his many years of dedication to the improvement of aviation 
services in Orange County.

INDIANS REARED OFF THE RESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a non-Indian who worked on an Indian reservation in Arizona from 1978 until 
1985, I would like to respond to your coverage of the Indian Child Welfare Act. 
In my position as director of Tribal Social Services, I experienced the impact 
of the act both on our reservation and through networking with other tribes. 
Initially, I had concerns about some aspects of the law, but quickly became 
aware of its importance and necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The difficult identity problems faced by Indians raised outside the Indian 
culture were apparent. I saw several adult Indians return to the reservation 
after growing up in non-Indian homes saying they needed to figure out who they 
were and where they fit. 
</P>
<P>
I saw Indian children, who had been taken into non-Indian homes as infants, 
experience sudden problems and disruptions when they became teens, with some of 
those families requesting that they be removed. There were young girls who 
identified beauty as being blonde and blue-eyed, and another little girl who 
had nightmares of Indians chasing her. 
</P>
<P>
There was the prospective adoptive mother who attempted to give the Indian 
children some sense of identity by having them attend a school-sponsored Indian 
culture program and by providing other external cultural awareness. When we 
brought them to the reservation for a visit, they asked to see the tepees. They 
had no concept that their ancestors never lived in tepees and no real sense of 
being Indian. 
</P>
<P>
I repeatedly saw tribal courts make very thoughtful decisions in (Indian Child 
Welfare Act) cases, and their focus was always the best interest of the child. 
To outsiders, this may not be so obvious. Poverty may be prevalent on 
reservations, but material wealth is not an important criterion in determining 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman involved in the current case remembers alcohol and child abuse 
as a child. We all know that these also occur off the reservation. In addition, 
today, tribes have access to better tribally designed family support programs 
that are part of the same movement that produced the (Indian Child Welfare 
Act). I believe that the (Indian Child Welfare Act) is not only legally 
correct, but is also morally correct.

ZAN THOMPSON: DOCTORING UP A MOVING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you move, you think about decorating, having furniture reupholstered, 
arranging a witty design of pictures and planting a garden that will look as if 
it might be a setting for Anne Hathaway's cottage. And you have to find all new 
people to look after your house and yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The last few days in Laguna De La Paz in the town of La Quinta, where Peaches 
and I have moved, have been beautiful. The sunrises have been pink and celadon, 
and the mountaintops frosted with snow circle the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the snow, the space and the sky, there are still those small 
bits of machinery it takes to make a life run smoothly. My friend, classy 
Judith Miller, has given me the names and numbers of her plumber, electrician 
and an exterminator, which is a good start. 
</P>
<P>
And you have to find doctors. Going to a new doctor is like going to a new 
school. Will the doctor like me? Will he be interested in my various 
malfunctions? 
</P>
<P>
I knew it would be a special problem for me because of the cadre of ladies and 
gentlemen who took care of me in Pasadena. Dr. Richard Diehl, the orthopedic 
surgeon who works with my breakaway bones, is a good friend, as are his wife, 
Cathy, and their gorgeous dog. Dr. Diehl and I have always found something to 
laugh at even in moments that weren't really funny. Surgeon Dr. Peter Ko and 
his wife, Mary, are two more friends, as are Dr. Donald Moyes and Dr. Arvid 
Underman. In addition to being esteemed doctors, they are able to find a laugh 
in the dark moments. 
</P>
<P>
I had to have a toe repaired the other day, and John Pedalino, the young man 
from whom I bought my Laguna De La Paz house, drove me into the Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and waited while Dr. Diehl did some embroidery 
work and then drove me back to the desert, to my eternal gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diehl and Cathy are coming to the La Quinta Golf and Tennis Resort for a 
couple of days of R&amp;R, at which time, Dr. Diehl will take out the stitches 
and remove a tenpenny nail that he seems to have left in my toe. Better care 
than that, there isn't. 
</P>
<P>
I am going to a handsome young dentist named Dr. Bruce Baumann, who went to 
Georgetown University. I lost a crown at a dinner party the other evening but 
fortunately did not swallow it. I palmed it daintily into my napkin and then 
went to Dr. Baumann the next day. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of removing the bits and pieces of the old tooth, Dr. Baumann 
administered some Novocaine deftly, causing no pain. I said, "You do that very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you can teach a monkey to do that," said Dr. Baumann modestly. 
</P>
<P>
When I left, the young woman at the desk told me how much I owed Dr. Baumann 
and how much it would be to have the next crown replaced. I was tempted to go 
back into the inner sanctum and ask, "Could you please tell me where that 
monkey is practicing and how much he charges for a crown?" 
</P>
<P>
You will be relieved to know I did not act smart. And when I inquired about 
prices from the young woman, she told me I'd had two crowns replaced and a root 
canal done. That is customarily the cost of a Bentley, so I was delighted with 
Dr. Baumann's fees, as well as his skills. 
</P>
<P>
I am going to an internist named Dr. Alan Kiselstein who took his residency at 
Cedars-Sinai. He is dignified, interested and sees his patients on the second 
of their appointment. He has obviously found a great ability, which I wish he 
would share with his colleagues. I'm trying to be stately and reserved, which 
is difficult for me to do when I have had doctors with whom I am accustomed to 
howling with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
I plan to sweep into Dr. Kiselstein's office with the presence of a duchess and 
not say anything silly. Wish me luck. I now have an internist, a dentist and an 
exterminator, and a lady can do quite well with those three for starters.

'ANATOMY OF BULLET WOUND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Required for all writers, directors, producers of TV Movies: "Anatomy of a 
Bullet Wound" (Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment people glorify use of weapons -- e.g. Rambo, Dirty Harry, 
"Death Wish" 1, 2 and 3, most Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder firearms are popular with street thugs and gangs. Why? That's all 
they see on the screen. Entertainment people are the first to decry private gun 
ownership, to blame the National Rifle Assn., yet they glamorize weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
A popular technique used for years in the entertainment industry is (depicting 
someone being hit) on the head using rocks, pipes, guns, bottles. Few things 
are more dangerous -- often lethal -- than a blow to the head. Your article 
said: "The guy (on TV) gets hit in the head with club and he passes out. He 
never retches, never vomits, never sees double, never goes into grand mal 
seizures. . . all of which occurs with people who have been struck in the head 
with blunt instruments. If they don't die." 
</P>
<P>
Let the entertainment industry clean up its act, deemphasize weaponry and 
deglorify personal mayhem. Maybe, just maybe, violence in our society will 
decrease.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: KNOWLEDGE OF LAWS HELPS RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 recodified and updated the myriad immigration 
and naturalization statutes that were passed in the previous half-century. The 
abolition of all racial tests and marital qualifications for citizenship ranks 
as the most important change in our naturalization policy. 
</P>
<P>
The act declares that "the right of a person to become a naturalized citizen of 
the United States shall not be denied or abridged because of race or sex or 
because such person is married." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of the major laws (and dates) affecting naturalization can aid 
genealogists searching for their ancestors' records. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* The first federal naturalization law in 1790 required that an applicant be a 
"free white person" who had resided for two years "within the limits and under 
the jurisdiction of the United States." The law also granted jurisdiction over 
naturalization to "any common law court of record in any one of the states." 
</P>
<P>
* In 1795 the residency requirement was raised from two to five years and in 
1798 to 14 years. However, in 1801, it was set back to five years, where it has 
remained ever since. 
</P>
<P>
* A wife and children under 21 became citizens at the time of the husband's 
naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
* A congressional report in 1845 showed that the state courts, where fees were 
lower and standards less rigorous, naturalized many more applicants than 
federal courts. In large cities, naturalization rates rose sharply during the 
two weeks preceding spring and fall elections. 
</P>
<P>
The first great wave of immigrants to this country after it gained independence 
began shortly after the War of 1812. Many of these new settlers were eager to 
become citizens. The law of 1802 required that applicants be free whites who 
declared their intention of becoming citizens at least three years prior to 
naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
They could file their applications at any local court of record (one whose 
proceedings are enrolled as a perpetual memorial, has common law jurisdiction, 
a seal and a clerk). They had to be residents for five years in the United 
States and one year in the state to which they applied. Finally, they had to 
swear an oath to uphold the Constitution and renounce allegiance to any foreign 
sovereign. 
</P>
<P>
In 1824, the minimum time between declaration of intention and the final award 
of citizenship papers was shortened to two years, and anyone residing in the 
country for the three years preceding the age of majority was allowed to take 
out both papers at once. 
</P>
<P>
While a uniform national rule for acquiring citizenship existed, the states 
were left free to fix the political and civil rights of aliens. During the 19th 
Century, in addition to easy terms for naturalization under federal statute, 
there were generous state laws and state constitutions that conferred 
political, commercial and property rights on aliens. For example, in 1846 
Wisconsin permitted all aliens who had filed a declaration of intention and who 
had resided in the state for one year to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1866 established that "all persons born in the United 
States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed" would 
receive United States citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Congress later made aliens of African descent or nativity eligible for 
naturalization. Under that law, Arabs and Hindus from Africa, but not 
necessarily from Asia, could qualify for naturalization -- a measure that later 
would create complex problems because it mixed geographic with ethnic and 
racial qualifications for citizenship.

to think. 
</P>
<P>
The use of deadly force is a course of last resort to protect life and

EPA WANTS 1 AGENCY FOR WATER CLEANUP;

POLLUTION: OFFICIALS WANT A SINGLE LEADER AS 'THE DRIVING FORCE' IN THE EFFORT 
TO TACKLE POLLUTION IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.

<P>
Federal environmental authorities are urging designation of a single local 
"super agency" to take charge of cleaning up the San Gabriel Valley's 
contaminated well water. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a local super agency to coordinate cleanup efforts was suggested in 
a three-page report, released here last week, on the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's analysis of the valley's polluted water. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been suffering from a lack of leadership," said John Wise, EPA deputy 
regional administrator who endorsed the super agency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Without that driving force," cleanup efforts will fail, said Wise, whose 
agency has spent $10 million investigating pollution in the San Gabriel Valley 
water basin. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as federal, state and local officials met here Thursday to 
seek a unified strategy to improve water quality in the basin, which serves 1 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the state Water Resources Control Board embraced the 
proposal, although they said legislation might be required to create a new 
agency or expand the authority of an existing one. 
</P>
<P>
But some valley water officials expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fear of another agency on top of existing ones," said Burton E. 
Jones, president of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
In the federal report, EPA officials caution that if one agency is not given 
broad authority to clean up water pollution, "EPA may be unable to implement 
necessary remedial actions even if . . . funding is available." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, local political and water officials agreed to form a task force to 
hasten action against water pollution. At the time, Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park) blamed EPA for delays. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, high levels of water pollution, partly the result of industrial 
solvents, were discovered in underground water supplies. Since then, EPA has 
determined that one-fourth of the 400 wells in the area are contaminated. 
Because of that, the agency has placed the San Gabriel Valley on its Superfund 
list and has studied the problem extensively. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Ziemba, EPA's project manager for the San Gabriel Valley cleanup, 
estimated that it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up the 
pollution over the next 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, several officials privately speculated that EPA is floating 
the idea in order to prod local officials to swifter action. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the Main San Gabriel Valley Basin Watermaster, the 
authority that oversees water rights in the region, defended local progress, 
saying they have been developing a battle plan while waiting for EPA to 
complete a technical assessment of the problem. Rob ert Ghirelli, executive 
director of the Los Angeles Regional Control Board, said there is a need for a 
coordinating agency with broad powers. Currently, no single agency has the 
money or the authority necessary to deal with the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all local reaction to proposal was negative. Dick Young, co-chairman of the 
East Valley's Organization toxics task force, said there would be a benefit 
because existing local agencies don't seem to have much power to deal with the 
problem.

PASADENA HOPES TO SEE THE LITE ON UTILITY BILLS

<P>
In an east Pasadena neighborhood of well-kept residences along Mountain Avenue, 
a dozen people in polo shirts were on a house-to-house mission. 
</P>
<P>
They knocked. Householders opened doors and let the crew of perfect strangers 
invade their privacy, explore their bathrooms and even issue comments on their 
cleaning habits. 
</P>
<P>
At one house, the visitor showed a woman that, by simply removing the bottom of 
her refrigerator, she could clean the dust from the cooling coils, improving 
the energy-guzzler's efficiency -- and saving money on her the electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, another visitor replaced a shower head with one that uses half 
the water, potentially saving nearly 50 gallons per shower. In a commode, she 
installed a flexible metal-and-hard-plastic device called a toilet dam, said to 
save half a gallon per flush. 
</P>
<P>
At still another house, the guest installed a super-efficient, long-lasting 
fluorescent light bulb in a coffee table lamp. The bulb, which sells for $10 to 
$15, can more than pay for itself over its five- to 10-year lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
But this one was free, courtesy of the city and its new "Lite Bill" energy 
conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
"This ties in nicely because I'm keen on recycling too," an amazed Megan 
Elliott said last week after she received her free conservation kit from one of 
the polo-shirted workers going door-to-door. "I didn't know about a lot of this 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that other residents will be pleased with the smorgasbord 
of approaches for cutting water and electric use in the city, and, in turn, 
reduce consumers' bills and the city's own energy-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, which operates one of the four municipal utilities in the Los Angeles 
Basin, has within the last six months embarked on an ambitious program that 
city officials say goes beyond federal and state mandates on energy 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city began a water survey and inspection program for residential 
users who use large amounts of water. The program, open to all water customers, 
provides conservation ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Lite Bill program started. It will reach 37,000 residences 
this year. The retail value of the free materials being handed out door-to-door 
is about $60 per residence; the city's cost is $25. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city has adopted a rate system that encourages 
conservation, especially during the summer months of peak demand: Rates are 
increased for consumers who use large amounts of water. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also adopted rules that require all new municipal landscaping to 
use plants that flourish in the semi-desert of Southern California. City 
officials say they want to set a good model for the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago, the city created the Resource Planning and Conservation 
Division of the city's Water and Power Department. "Conservation programs did 
exist, but there weren't as many or as intense," said Mariann Long, the city's 
conservation and consumer programs coordinator, who previously had worked in a 
similar Santa Monica municipal project. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some environmentalists say the city has taken too long to implement the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not satisfied," said activist Tim Brick, a member of the city's 
utility advisory panel and the city's representative on the board of the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet critics acknowledge that, when compared to the other three municipal 
utilities in Los Angeles County, Pasadena spends a far greater portion of its 
revenues to promote conservation. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the latest spending of revenues by the region's four municipal 
utilities shows that Pasadena spends $18 for every $1,000 of revenue to help 
customers cut water and electric usage. Utility leaders in the field nationally 
spend nearly twice as much as that. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Los Angeles spends $6.80 per $1,000, and Glendale and Burbank 
even less: Burbank, $2 per $1,000, and Glendale, $1 per $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pasadena officials boast that no other city-operated utility in the 
country goes to such great lengths on so many fronts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the municipal utilities are looking at either water or electricity. 
What we're saying is that there's a synergy between the two," said Deputy City 
Manager Edward K. Aghjayan, who oversees the Water and Power Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why we can't reduce water and electric consumption by 25%. 
In terms of the positive impact on the environment and scarcity of resources 
alone, we could justify our expenditures on conservation," said Aghjayan, who, 
before coming to Pasadena four years ago, had set up nationally recognized 
conservation programs in Austin, Tex., and Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the voluntary conservation approach Pasadena is actively 
encouraging, Aghjayan cited the new Doubletree Hotel, where special 
low-water-use toilets were installed at the city's suggestion. The toilets cost 
the hotel's developer an extra $30,000, Aghjayan said, but there will be a 50% 
savings on water needed to flush, and an overall reduction of 25% to 30% of the 
hotel's water bill. In two years, he said, the hotel will have recouped the 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, conservation makes economic sense for a utility company and 
for consumers, he said. "To the extent that our customers conserve, they not 
only save money for themselves but we save money by not having to build more 
facilities, improve power plants or treat more water." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, when consumers use less power, the city generates less, he said. 
That helps because the city's power plant faces increasingly tighter 
restrictions on the amount of emissions it can legally release while it 
generates power. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting on the bandwagon late, but we're getting on with a bang," said 
City Director Rick Cole. "There's some justification to the boast that we're 
going beyond what other (communities) are doing." 
</P>
<P>
But Cole expressed concern that the city, in its aggressive pursuit of 
progress, may give the appearance of establishing a "water police force" to 
penalize those who don't comply. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thomas E. Pape, a city conservation program specialist, said: "It's no 
hard sell and we're not the water police or the energy police. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what we do is salesmanship. We're trying to show that it's easy and 
it's low cost and the savings are guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
The Lite Bill program will cost about $800,000 this year. In addition, the city 
expects its conservation programs to cost it $200,000 in lost revenues over 
five years because of lower consumption. Yet the city will save in other ways, 
and will receive a $373,000 credit for water-savings efforts from the 
Metropolitan Water District. The incentive is offered because the district can 
reduce its pumping expenses when use goes down. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's efforts, meanwhile, are not occurring in a vacuum. On Wednesday, a 
coalition of environmentalists, utility executives and state officials 
announced a $550-million proposal to boost California to the forefront of 
energy conservation. Under the plan, the state's four major utilities would 
double what they spend to encourage conservation. 
</P>
<P>
It would provide rebates to customers who install energy-saving devices such as 
super-efficient light bulbs -- just like the ones the people in polo shirts 
passed out last week on Mountain Avenue in Pasadena. 
</P>

POMONA STUDENTS FALL INTO LAP OF LUXURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mark Pettis went away to college, he knew there would be changes in his 
life style. He just didn't think they would include maid service, swimming pool 
and spa. 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what Pettis and 55 other Pomona College students have been 
experiencing since Jan. 14, when they checked out of their dorm and into rooms 
at Griswold's Claremont Center, a hotel and restaurant complex about a mile 
from campus. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus came after campus officials decided to close the dormitory, A.K. 
Smiley Hall, after a structural check during winter break revealed that it is a 
potential earthquake hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the 1908 dorm, the oldest on campus, originally was planned for 
the summer. But, after reviewing the structural study, officials decided to 
evacuate the building and start the work in early February, said John Giboney, 
director of campus planning and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The dorm is scheduled to reopen by the fall semester. Meanwhile, Smiley's 
student residents will be relocated in a new 87-bed dorm scheduled to be 
completed March 1. 
</P>
<P>
But until then, the evacuees are roughing it at Griswold's, taking advantage of 
room service and other amenities at the 273-bed hotel, which ordinarily charges 
$75 a night for single rooms and $85 for doubles. Shuttle buses ferry students 
between the campus and the hotel every half-hour from 7 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., 
with runs until 1:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought this was ludicrous," said Alan Taylor, a senior who was one 
of the resident advisers at Smiley Hall. "But this is the most elegant hotel 
I've ever stayed in. . . . The major inconvenience is having to take a shuttle 
back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Parsons, a senior anthropology major, said: "Some of my friends are 
envious because we have maid service, and we don't have to make our own beds." 
</P>
<P>
The students, who are paying $2,600 a semester for room and board on campus, do 
not have to pay extra for their hotel stay, except for room service snacks, if 
they order them. 
</P>
<P>
The students still eat their meals in a campus dining hall. However, the hotel 
stay is costing the college $50 a night per room, double occupancy, college 
officials said. At that rate, 28 rooms would cost the college $1,400 per night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upscale accommodations, some students complain about what they are 
missing back on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my last semester here . . . my last chance to have a campus life," 
said Sylvia Hurston, a senior government major. "Living off-campus makes me 
feel excluded. Here you can't hang out in the hallway and just talk. It's not 
as carefree as we're used to." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Elderkin, dean of residential life, said the initial reaction of the 
students was "surprise and some dismay." 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona College is a residential college," Elderkin said. "Living on campus is 
very important to the academic, social and personal lives of most of our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
The students have caused no problems with the hotel's paying clientele, 
officials said. "Things are going really well. We haven't had any complaints 
from guests," said Barbara Leming, corporate sales manager for Griswold's. "We 
have always worked very closely with the colleges, and we are glad to help 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Smiley Hall, a three-story concrete structure with a red tile roof, was 
dedicated on Nov. 21, 1908, and hailed as a symbol of classical architecture. 
But in recent years, its age has begun to show. 
</P>
<P>
"The plumbing was the worst," Hurston said. "If you were taking a shower and 
someone flushed the toilet you would lose water. . . . The sink would sometimes 
clog, and you could tell that the walls had been painted several times." 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled $1.25 million to $1.5 million renovation of the 72-room dorm 
includes upgrading the walls with reinforced concrete and replacing plumbing, 
heating and electrical systems. But the outside of the building, Giboney said, 
will remain unchanged to "maintain its historical integrity."

major structural renovations to make it earthquake-safe. The college is paying 
the hotel bills until a new dorm is ready.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: A 'BARGAIN' HOUSE IS NO BARGAIN IF IT HAS INCURABLE 
PROPERTY DEFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We want your opinion on a bargain house we have been considering 
buying for the last two months. It is a two-bedroom house located on a small 
lot on a very narrow street in what we consider a lower-income neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But the price is a "steal" and the seller will finance our purchase with only a 
6% down payment to pay the realtor's sales commission. We talked with several 
of the neighbors and they seem like very nice working-class people. Although we 
realize this house is not perfect and it needs some fix-up work, what do you 
think? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Keep looking. If you have been thinking about buying this house for two 
months, I think you are trying to tell yourself not to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The problems you describe are known as incurable property defects. It is best 
to avoid these drawbacks unless there are overwhelming advantages. In most 
towns, the demand for two-bedroom homes is very limited. Most home buyers want 
at least three bedrooms and two bathrooms. But the location on a small lot in a 
congested lower-income neighborhood is another incurable defect. 
</P>
<P>
The only advantage you listed is the low down payment with the seller 
financing. I suggest you prepare to sell on the original contract terms. 
Resisting the buyer who apparently really wants to buy your home could prove to 
be a costly experience. Ask your attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
If you can afford to buy another home without the incurable defects you listed, 
I suggest you keep looking. 
</P>
<P>
Ways to Discover Amount Seller Got 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I find out how much a seller got for her house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ask her. But if you don't believe the answer, request your realty agent to 
check for you. Most realty agents have access through their local Board of 
Realtors or Multiple Listing Service to recent sales prices and terms. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to inquire at the customer service department of a local 
title insurance company for the free information you need. Or you can go to the 
county office where deeds are recorded and check the transfer tax paid. If it 
is based on the full sales price, rather than on just the equity transferred, 
the clerk will show you how to calculate the selling price.

Q: The house next door to mine is occupied by a middle-aged man who told me he 
wants to sell his life estate because his job has been transferred out of town. 
Although he is only 42, I am very cautious. But I would like to acquire this 
house, which has no mortgage. He wants me to pay him only $10,000. Is this a 
good deal? 
</P>
<P>
A: Maybe. Your first step should be to get a copy of the life estate document. 
It might specify that the life estate terminates if the resident vacates the 
house. I'm sure you are aware the life estate ends when the life tenant dies. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is only 42 and has a long life expectancy, when he dies, your 
rights to use the home would terminate. He could have a heart attack or die in 
an auto accident any day, so don't pay too much. 
</P>
<P>
Paying just $10,000 for his life tenancy rights could be a bargain if you can 
rent the house for a substantial rent. Chances are, you are the only interested 
buyer for that life estate so don't be afraid to bargain hard. 
</P>
<P>
You might also want to contact the remainder man to see if you can buy out his 
rights, which have very little value until the life tenant dies. Once you own 
the life tenancy and the remainder interest, you own the property. Ask a real 
estate attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
Finding Sale Homes That Aren't Advertised 
</P>
<P>
Q: We want to buy a home in a specific neighborhood where homes rarely are 
advertised for sale. But we know homes are selling there. How can we learn 
about homes in that area before someone else buys them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Contact several real estate offices near the area where you want to live. 
Talk with the managers. Explain that you want to work with the firm's top agent 
who sells homes in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be in a hurry. But be sure the agent knows you are well-qualified to buy 
and will act quickly when a home becomes available. You might also want to 
write personal letters to the homeowners in the neighborhood expressing an 
interest in buying their home if they should wish to sell. That technique might 
also produce results. 
</P>
<P>
Rent Loss Not Valid Income Tax Deduction 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last summer, I signed a one-year lease on a house. Then I got married last 
month and moved to my new husband's house. Two of my girlfriends have agreed to 
take over my lease if I will pay them $200 per month, which I have agreed to 
do, to get out of my lease. Can I take an income tax deduction for my $200 per 
month loss? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but your rent loss is a personal, non-deductible expense. 
</P>
<P>
Let Buyer Obtain Own First Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own our home free and clear. It has been listed for sale for almost three 
months with no purchase offers. I am thinking perhaps we should obtain an 
assumable mortgage to make the purchase easier for the buyer. What do you think 
of this idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. Although homes with large assumable mortgages usually sell easier 
than homes without assumable financing, obtaining a new mortgage for an unknown 
buyer is usually not a profitable idea. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the buyer may have other finance plans, such as to 
foolishly pay cash for your home. The result would be that you wasted your time 
and money obtaining a new mortgage for your home. A better approach is to be 
flexible on your sale terms and let your realty agent know you're willing to 
help finance the sale by carrying back a second mortgage. Let the buyer obtain 
their own first mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
No Tax Deferral on Vacation Home Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: We hope to sell our winter ski cabin this year. Can we avoid the profit tax 
by reinvesting the sales proceeds in another vacation home, such as a Florida 
condominium? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, the Internal Revenue Code 1034 "roll-over residence replacement rule" 
only applies to the sale of your principal residence, not to the transfer of 
your vacation or second home. Please consult your tax adviser for further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Estate, Not Heir, Pays Federal Taxes, Debts 
</P>
<P>
Q: My late aunt willed me a commercial property worth about $1 million. She 
left her other properties to different relatives. However, I am very concerned 
because I have no idea how I will pay the estate tax on this big building. What 
should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't worry. Payment of the estate tax is the responsibility of your aunt's 
estate. The customary policy is to use the decedent's cash and other liquid 
assets to pay estate taxes and other costs. However, if sufficient cash is not 
available to pay the taxes and debts of your aunt, then it may become necessary 
to sell the commercial property to raise cash. Of course, then you would 
receive whatever proceeds are left. Please consult the estate executor or 
administrator for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Seller Who Sold You Half a New Roof 
</P>
<P>
Q: We were swindled. I know it was stupid, but we bought a house direct from 
the owner without the benefit of a professional inspection. When I asked her 
about the roof, she took us outside and showed us the good-looking new roof. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the north side of the house. Less than a month after we moved in, 
my wife noticed the roof on the south side of the house doesn't match the new 
roof on the north side. When I called the seller, she said she never told us 
there was a new roof on the south side, she just showed us the new north-side 
roof. I got an estimate to re-roof the south side and it will cost about 
$1,500. Do you think we should sue the seller? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why not? You have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Anything can 
happen in a trial court, but judges are getting stricter all the time when 
dealing with home sellers who fail to disclose property defects to buyers. The 
old days of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) are gone, and some states such 
as California now require home sellers to give buyers written disclosures of 
any known defects. 
</P>
<P>
However, your problem will be proving that the lack of a new roof on the south 
side is a significant defect.

MAKING SENSE OF LENDERS' TERMS

QUESTION: We are shopping around for a mortgage for our first home, and are 
very confused about the many mortgages that currently are available. The 
adjustable-rate mortgage is of interest to us, but we do not understand how 
that works. 
</P>
<P>
We have heard that there may be problems with this kind of loan. What exactly 
is an adjustable-rate mortgage, and do you have any advice on whether we should 
use this form of loan? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Every day, it seems that the creative mortgage financing industry comes 
up with a new kind of mortgage -- or at least a new twist on the old ones. Many 
of the mortgages have acronyms, and thus you may see such mortgages as RAMs 
(reverse annuity mortgages), SAMs (shared appreciation mortgages), GEMs 
(growing equity mortgages), and, of course, ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages). 
</P>
<P>
The larger number of mortgages currently available makes it quite difficult for 
anyone -- be you a first-time buyer or an experienced investor -- to determine 
exactly which mortgage is best. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustable-rate mortgage was created in the early 1980s, when lenders were 
burned because homeowners were repaying their loans at 8%, 9% or 10%, while the 
cost of that money was then over 15%. 
</P>
<P>
About eight or nine years ago, lenders made a basic decision. The shorter the 
term of the loan, the lower the interest rate would be. Thus, today you can 
still obtain a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage, meaning that you will be 
guaranteed that the mortgage payment will be the same every month. But the 
fixed-rate 30-year mortgage -- even though currently quite low -- still carries 
about the highest interest rate going. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustable-rate mortgage is also guaranteed to stay on the books for 30 
years, but the interest rate is adjusted periodically. There are variations on 
the adjustable-rate theme. If the rate is adjusted every five years, for 
example, the initial rate will be lower than for a fixed 30-year mortgage, but 
higher than an adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts every year. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the most common ARMs are the one-year or three-year adjustable. But even 
here, consumers should shop around for the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what you should look for: 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, what is the initial interest rate? This rate is defined as 
the rate on which your loan will be based in the adjustment period, whether 
that is one, three or five years. 
</P>
<P>
Second, is the ARM based on a negative amortization schedule? Although my 
experience is that most ARMs currently are not amortized on a negative basis, 
some lenders are still using the negative factor. 
</P>
<P>
This means that, although you may be paying a low interest rate for the first 
year -- let's say 7 1/2% or 8 1/2% -- the interest is still being charged on 
your loan at a higher rate, for example 10% or 11%. 
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, the extra interest payment (the difference between what 
you are paying and what is being charged you) is added to your mortgage 
balance. Under no circumstances can I recommend the negative amortization 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Next, determine what the yearly rate adjustment will be. Is there a cap on the 
yearly increases, and on what index does your lender base the adjustable rate? 
</P>
<P>
Many lenders look at the weekly average yield on one-year Treasury bills, which 
is published periodically by the Federal Reserve Board. Other lenders use the 
so-called "cost of funds" approach, while others are beginning to use the 
London Interbank Offered Rate (also called LIBOR). The question of which index 
is better for home buying consumers is hotly debated, and must be reserved for 
a subsequent column. 
</P>
<P>
However, the lender then adds to that index a rate adjustment (called a 
margin), and if the adjusted rate is higher than the old one, your interest 
will be modified accordingly for the next year. This is confusing, but let us 
look at an example. 
</P>
<P>
The current Treasury Bill Index for one year is about 7.8. If the rate 
adjustment offered by the lender (the index or margin) is 3 points, even if the 
index stays at 7.8% next year, your new payments for the next year could be 
increased to 10.8% (7.8 plus 3). 
</P>
<P>
However, if there is an annual rate cap, you cannot be charged more than that 
cap. Thus, if your loan is $100,000 at an initial rate of 7.5%, and if there is 
a two-percentage point cap on yearly adjustments, even if the index increases 
substantially, your new interest rate can only rise the first year to 9.5% (or 
7.5 plus 2% cap). 
</P>
<P>
Another point to consider is whether there is a ceiling on the overall amount 
that your rate can increase. Lenders realize that the ARM without such a 
ceiling is a potential disaster for consumers. If you start with a 7.5% loan, 
and if there is a 2% point cap on the yearly increases, it is conceivable that 
at the end of the fifth year you could be facing a mortgage rate of 17.5%, if 
our economic picture becomes severe. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, most lenders are now putting an overall ceiling on the amount that your 
interest rate can rise. And usually it is limited to between 5 and 6 percentage 
points. Thus, if your initial rate is 7.5%, the most you can ever pay wold be 
13.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that you understand what the ceilings are and get them in writing 
before you commit yourself to an adjustable-rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Many lenders are also offering the option of converting the adjustable-rate 
mortgage into a fixed-rate mortgage down the years. If this option is 
available, obtain a clear understanding of how it works, when you can exercise 
this option and what, if any, fee will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustable-rate mortgage offers flexibility for many homeowners. However, 
as in today's market conditions, where the spread between the initial ARM and a 
fixed-rate mortgage is relatively small, you have to give serious thought to 
whether you want the luxury of an initial low rate, with the potential drawback 
of that rate increasing in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, you also have to determine how long you believe you will be 
staying in your new property. If you will be keeping the house or the 
condominium for only three or four years, in my opinion it certainly makes 
sense to use the lower ARM concept. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, you have the right to shop around for the best possible rate.

FOR TRAVELERS IN THE GRAY '90S, IT'S ABOUT TIME; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: A POLL RECENTLY DISCLOSED THAT HALF OF ALL ADULT AMERICANS EXPECT TO 
VACATION OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES DURING THE NEXT 10 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD MORIN, From the Washington Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1990s, America's baby boomers will come of travel age -- if they haven't 
done so already. With careers largely made and earnings at a peak, the kids are 
up and running. As a result, this generation is ready to explore the world in a 
way that's never been done. Some travel agents are calling their big rush the 
"Gray '90s." 
</P>
<P>
What they want, according to a recent national survey of travelers and industry 
experts, is travel that departs from the familiar, seeks the exotic -- and 
comes with a money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will the boomers swell the ranks of leisure travelers, but half of all 
adult Americans expect to vacation outside the continental United States during 
the next 10 years, according to a Washington Post survey. 
</P>
<P>
Another survey of travelers and travel experts found that about four out of 
five vacationers plan to make more trips in the '90s than they did in the past 
five years, and fewer than one in 12 expect to cut back on travel. 
</P>
<P>
That survey also expected: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Americans to travel farther for shorter periods, favoring weekend trips, 
cruises and independent tours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trips to be more frequent, though not necessarily less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Airports to be as bad as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Time, not money, will shape many travel plans. More than half of the travel 
agents questioned in the Tour and Travel News and Ask Mr. Foster poll predicted 
that getaways of two to five days will be the most frequently taken trips in 
the early to mid-'90s, continuing a trend that began in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Many (baby boomers) had two incomes, which means two things," said Linda Ball, 
editorial director of Tour and Travel News. "They have more money to spend, and 
they face the challenge of trying to coordinate two schedules." 
</P>
<P>
In the poll nearly half of the leisure travelers interviewed agreed that 
"getting away will be even more of a necessity now" than five years ago. For 
some, travel literally may be just what the doctor orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the stress level of modern life," Ball said. "People have more of a need 
for a reality break. You used to have mental-health days, today you have 
getaways." 
</P>
<P>
All this is good news for the travel industry. Experts predict that revenue 
growth will be greatest in the pricey end of the travel business. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boomers, whose children are mostly grown and gone -- becoming what the 
industry calls "untethered marrieds" -- will suddenly be freed from the need to 
stay in budget motels near family oriented attractions. Increasingly, they are 
likely to choose the comfort of more luxurious accommodations, if only for the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that cost will be no object. According to the Tour and Travel 
poll, 78% of those leisure travelers interviewed said finding moderately priced 
accommodations was important when selecting a hotel. Still, travel agents 
reported that only 17% of their clients chose budget hotels and 62% stayed at 
moderately priced hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers in the '90s will be much more sophisticated, according to industry 
analysts, and far more demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more people have experience traveling on business and apply it to their 
leisure travel," Ball said. "There's a lot more information available. And the 
more information available, the smarter they get and the more demanding they 
get." 
</P>
<P>
This familiarity will breed contempt for familiar destinations, both in the 
United States and abroad, and will bring an interest in adventure trips and 
travel to remote destinations. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a richer mosaic of possibilities," Ball said. "More active 
trips, not as passive as they were in the '70s. People want to go to New 
Zealand to walk on the Milford Track. They're not going to Australia to look at 
the kangaroos, but to scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef." 
</P>
<P>
This adventuresome spirit will even be part of those long weekend getaways, 
which industry observers say can pack sufficient thrills into three or four 
days to satisfy all but the most jaded adventurer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tour and Travel experts designed this prototype vacation based on 
responses from their survey of travel agents: "A short cruise featuring 
first-class accommodations and an itinerary that includes either cultural or 
adventure-oriented shore excursions." The success of one-day "cruises to 
nowhere" out of Miami to gamble and shop in Freeport, the Bahamas, have shown 
that even day-trips don't have to be dull. 
</P>
<P>
In the '90s many first-time travelers will get their feet wet in Fiji, not 
Florida. The Tour and Travel poll showed that interest in independent and 
adventure travel is exceptionally strong among those who had never traveled 
extensively. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see now among this group are people trying their first trip to some 
longstanding interest," Ball said. "Sport-fishing in Belize, crafts in South 
America, travel linked to some interest in their lives. The world just seems 
much more accessible to people in general." 
</P>
<P>
Older Americans, too, will seek a more active, participatory kind of travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago senior citizen travel was thought of as just one thing: little 
old ladies with blue hair on buses, or at least that was the image," Ball said. 
"Now, as life styles have changed, people have come to realize that being older 
doesn't mean being passive." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, agents surveyed reported that they expect the biggest spurt in their 
business to come from so-called "mature travelers" between 50 and 70, a group 
that includes the first wave of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be the fastest-growing segment of the population," Ball said, "and a 
lot of the wealth of the country will be centered in that group." 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 years travel agencies will become more traveler-friendly, 
according to industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
Agents interviewed in the Tour and Travel poll predicted a proliferation of 800 
numbers to help travelers through problems on the road. And there will be more 
money-back guarantees if paradise turns out to be something less. 
</P>
<P>
"Guarantees seem to be the coming thing," Ball said. "The guarantees often 
include the price of accommodations. There will be more snow-vacation packages 
that will guarantee snow, more sunny places that guarantee sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
Some travel experts are predicting that the days of the full-service travel 
agency may be coming to an end; two out of three agents surveyed by Tour and 
Travel News said they plan to specialize more. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a good travel agent may become somewhat like finding a good doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll seek more referrals from your friends," Ball said. "Within a travel 
agency, you'll find more individual agents specializing. Now you see cruise 
specialists.

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS

<P>
Travelers were enraged this week after learning of a new (old, actually) state 
tax law pertaining to goods bought in foreign countries. Although on the books 
since 1935, the law allowing billing became enforceable following the 
automation of U.S. Customs files. And while the tax amounts to peanuts (6.5%), 
it is proving irksome. 
</P>
<P>
Californians complain that it comes as a surprise addition to duty (10%) 
already imposed by the federal government. Thus far only a handful of 
Californians have been billed. Still, the numbers promise to increase as 
residents make their 1990 Customs declarations. Customs requires the 
declaration when merchandise exceeds $400 ($800 in the case of Guam, American 
Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands). One state official suggested that travelers 
who failed to declare their 1989 purchases come forth voluntarily and pay up. 
To which a returning resident declared, "You must think we're crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
French/American Affair: France is launching a new campaign to lure Americans to 
the provinces. Direct flights from the United States to 10 hubs besides Paris: 
Nice, Lyon, Lille, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse, 
Montpellier, Marseille. Inside France, Air Inter (the nation's domestic 
airline) has stepped up service on 50 routes. At the same time, the 300-m.p.h. 
TGV Atlantique (world's fastest train) has begun service from Paris to Rennes, 
Nantes and beyond to "land's end" in the Finistere.

A new 72-page guide (available from travel agents and the French Government 
Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly Hills 90212) provides 
sightseeing tips, detailed itineraries. The "France Discovery Guide" can also

CHURCHILL'S HIDDEN HEADQUARTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
They look innocent -- silent concrete rooms of iron cots and yellowing paper in 
a maze of tunnels sprawling beneath the streets of Whitehall. The maps, gaudy 
with colored pins, and lanterns waiting to flicker into light, seem like school 
playthings. 
</P>
<P>
This is a museum called the Cabinet War Rooms, the secret headquarters of Sir 
Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
As you enter, you might hear the ghosts of another time: Churchill, padding 
about in his pale-blue jump suit, reciting Kipling with subtle flamboyance. 
</P>
<P>
Or it might be the cry of a bagpipe played by a solitary, kilted guard; the 
clink of silverware and ringing of glasses in an austere mess; the brittle 
popping of distant anti-aircraft guns as Lord Mountbatten, perhaps, slips into 
St. James's Park to watch swift, free-wheeling clouds lighten from fires 
blazing along both sides of the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have guessed? The offices opened in 1938, 10 feet below government 
offices on Great George Street. 
</P>
<P>
Sworn-to-secrecy workers fortified a warren of ancient tunnels only steps from 
Henry VIII's wine cellar. Working at night with diverted supplies, a handful of 
men made the shadowy space close to bombproof. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Churchill ducked into the dusty basement shelter to announce: 
"This is the room from which I'll direct the war." And as summer deepened into 
fall and the Battle of Britain burst overhead, he shared the "quiet dungeon 
galleries" with hundreds of weary staff members. 
</P>
<P>
From these rooms, Churchill masterminded more than 100 late-night Cabinet 
meetings, called former President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the world's first 
hotline, dozed in his suite on a silk-covered bed. Here, too, with great and 
arrogant style, he spoke on BBC broadcasts to his nation. 
</P>
<P>
Sealed after the war, the six acres of rooms were abandoned until 1981, when 20 
of the most important rooms were dusted off by the Imperial War Museum and 
opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the entrance lies the Cabinet Room, restored as it was on an autumn 
day in 1940. The cloth-wrapped table, almost filling the space, is laid for 25, 
pencils idle across faded blue blotters. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill's wooden chair anchors its usual spot, back-row center, near a 
sand-filled fire bucket for his cigar butts. 
</P>
<P>
Over the door, red and green light bulbs await an air raid signal, and the 
ceiling, striped with steel girders, looks a bit eerie in the deep shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden down a hall, a soundproof cubicle housed the hotline to Roosevelt in the 
White House. Developed by Bell Telephone Labs in 1943, the huge device crossed 
the Atlantic Ocean aboard the Queen Elizabeth and was connected to this room by 
underground cable from the basement of Selfridge's Oxford Street store. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the two men talked about, enough laughter and swapped stories echoed 
in this room for Roosevelt to declare: "It is fun to be in the same decade with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Churchill pinched the "vacant" or "engaged" door lock from a public toilet on a 
whim, they say. "Part joke, part luck," agrees the museum's curator, Jon 
Wenzel, "but it provided good camouflage for this most secret room." 
</P>
<P>
Turn a corner and Churchill's bedroom-office comes into view. Framed by heavy 
draperies ready to pull discreetly over wall maps of Britain's defense 
installations, it comes close to coziness. 
</P>
<P>
A bit of carpet warms the floor. There are easy chairs and, on a desk, Romeo y 
Julietas cigars nestled in a humidor. A reliable supply of French champagne 
waited (full bottles of 1928 and 1934 Pol Roger are displayed.) 
</P>
<P>
Churchill, who found the rooms claustrophobic, fancied a bed upstairs or in the 
converted Down Street tube station a few steps off Piccadilly. 
</P>
<P>
For those who had to stay, batteries of ultraviolet lamps offered the rays of 
sunlight. Notice boards displaying weather information helped. 
</P>
<P>
So did that great English virtue of plain stubbornness. And, as Wenzel says, 
"Three years was the maximum for the staff during the war. Working here takes 
its toll even now. When we get ill, it hangs on. It's from being underground." 
</P>
<P>
A small crowd gathers around the Map Room, a favorite of most of the 240,000 
visitors who flock to these rooms each year. All the war information poured 
into this nerve center, which was continually manned by a staff of officers 
from the army, navy, and Royal Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Old soldiers up from retirement in Chelsea study the wall of maps, their hands 
clamped behind them. Hundreds of colored pins and threads plot Russian and 
German front lines, naval convoy routes, the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the maps have been pinpricked so often that they threaten to crack into 
a jigsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, there's a recorded shriek of a siren, the booming and trembling of an 
air raid barrage. 
</P>
<P>
As the sound dies, Churchill's flawless prose begins. "He has kindled a fire in 
British hearts," he growls. You stop and listen. 
</P>
<P>
Near the center of the room, a fragile, gray-haired couple, heads cocked and 
lost in memories, watch the Battle of Britain all over again. 
</P>
<P>
As you leave the war rooms, take a small detour toward the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
It seems natural to find Churchill's familiar, square-jawed profile looming 
among statues of former President Abraham Lincoln and former Prime Minister 
Benjamin Disraeli in the wide-open spaces of Parliament Square. 
</P>
<P>
Staring in perpetuity at the House of Commons he loved so well, Churchill's 
sculptured posturing draws out photographers and painters. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond, follow the flow of the crowd into Westminster Abbey. Skirting the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, you'll find a stone placed on the 25th anniversary 
of the Battle of Britain, a few months after Churchill's death. 
</P>
<P>
Read the inscription. Chiseled deep: "Remember Winston Churchill." 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet War Rooms are open daily 10 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., and are easily 
reached by taking the tube to Westminster Station. Admission is about $5. 
</P>
<P>
An easy-to-follow booklet (or cassette tape) is available at the entrance. It 
fills you in on details. There is also a well-stocked gift shop with a good 
collection of books and photos on the subject.

DINING OUT: CONTEMPORARY CUISINE OF NEW ZEALAND IS HOT 
</P>

AUCKLAND, New Zealand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when getting anything more interesting to eat in New Zealand 
than roast leg of lamb was chancy at best. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with the country celebrating its 150th anniversary, diners will find 
that things have changed dramatically. In cities as well as in small hotels and 
lodges in the countryside, restaurants are bringing contemporary cuisine to New 
Zealand and making use of the country's extraordinary ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
From kiwi fruit and Granny Smith apples to fish such as orange roughy, New 
Zealand's bounty is familiar on U.S. tables. We found that eating the real 
thing in the country of its origin is often a different experience. 
</P>
<P>
Orange roughy, a firm white fish with mild flavor -- nice enough, as served in 
the States -- reveals a sublety of previously undiscovered texture and flavor 
when eaten only hours from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We have better and fresher raw ingredients in New Zealand than almost any 
country in the world," said Annabel Langbein, director of a company 
specializing in developing new markets for New Zealand produce around the 
world. She also writes extensively for several food magazines in Australia and 
New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"The country is small and getting food to market is easy, but it's only been 
recently that chefs have begun to realize what is here. Things are changing 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," she said, "bluff oysters are in season." 
</P>
<P>
Never turning down an invitation for oysters, we set out on a whirlwind tour of 
Auckland restaurants. Anticipation replaced our jet lag as we settled into a 
table at Antoine's. 
</P>
<P>
A small restaurant in an old house, it's an oasis of quiet on a busy street 
with lots of nighttime activity. Antoine's is one of the top restaurants in 
Auckland, but nothing quite prepared us for the prices. Appetizers were about 
$18 New Zealand, main courses about $30 (about $12 and $20 U.S.). We had heard 
that New Zealand was a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
This was only our first stop, so we chose a selection of starters. A soupe de 
poisson ($15 New Zealand), as flavorful as any in France, came with strong 
garlic mayonnaise. Chunks of fresh local fish had been steamed and then tossed 
in a lemon cream sauce and served on a tender and crisp pastry shell ($18 New 
Zealand). Our favorite, a hot blue vein cheese souffle ($18), was served with 
cream on a bed of spinach. 
</P>
<P>
When we opened the souffle we found a perfectly poached egg in the center. The 
flavors of cream, blue cheese and poached egg were irresistible. We often read 
about dishes like this but seldom see them on menus. 
</P>
<P>
Main courses at Antoine's include a different version of cassoulet, a rich stew 
with lamb and venison ($30 New Zealand) and a chicken breast filled with a New 
Zealand Bourguignon cheese -- similar to a Brie -- and coated with sesame 
seeds, baked and served with a light tomato and fresh basil sauce ($30 New 
Zealand). 
</P>
<P>
Then we headed across town to The French Cafe. Next to the post office, The 
Cafe was casual and packed with diners. White walls, an open kitchen and a rear 
courtyard for dining gave the place a contemporary feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Its prices are reasonable. The menu is eclectic -- with Cajun, Oriental, French 
and Italian dishes. We tried stir-fried vegetables ($5 New Zealand), richly 
flavorful French fries ($2.80) and char-grilled pork fillets ($10.90), which 
were served with a Chinese plum sauce, and a watercress and pear salad. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't try the baked lamb with sweet potatoes, but did sample the sweet 
potatoes, a variety raised by the Maori. They were out of oysters. 
</P>
<P>
We ended our evening with a stop at the Verandah Bar &amp; Grill, near where we 
began and just down the street from Antoine's. The restaurant is upstairs in an 
area of shops and boutiques, and it's always crowded. It's open seven days, 
noon to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Again they were out of oysters. Everyone, it seems, eats bluff oysters in 
season, and we were beginning to despair of ever having them. Instead, we chose 
dessert and coffee. Tarte tatin arrived slightly warm with a rich caramelized 
taste and tender crust. 
</P>
<P>
Growing apples, according to Langbein, is a major New Zealand industry. They 
are grown for flavor, not for appearance, so when on sale they usually are not 
shiny and waxed. The chocolate cake was suitably dark and heavy. 
</P>
<P>
We also tried the poached pears with a lemon chocolate sauce and heavy cream. 
The combination of chocolate and lemon in the sauce was surprisingly good. 
Desserts are all $7.90 New Zealand. Large cups of good cappuccino ($2.50) made 
a perfect ending. 
</P>
<P>
The next day we headed for Victoria Park Market, which has stalls selling 
everything from T-shirts to local crafts. After the night's feasting we thought 
a visit to the Victoria food halls and a little light grazing might be in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Although very casual, the fast-food stalls turn out surprisingly good fare, 
from chicken wings to hand-cut French fries. The candy market sells all-natural 
butterscotch candies, which make a nice dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner in the Longchamp, the dining room at The Regent of Auckland hotel, was 
everything Langbein had promised. Chef Serafin Bueno Sanz combines Spanish 
influences with the exceptional produce of New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
We ordered bluff oysters as a first course. Small and plump, they had a 
slightly crunchy texture and must rank with the best in the world. These 
oysters are never exported. 
</P>
<P>
After the oysters we had a tartare of marinated salmon and crayfish with 
avocado, a dish that could have been a disaster had not the ingredients been 
totally fresh and full of flavor. A rich chicken consomme followed. It was 
accompanied by a deep-fried chicken wing. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than a sorbet, Sanz served us a cold soup of fejoias and lime. The 
perfume of the fejoias, a local fruit, created just the right antipication for 
a main course of a medallion of veal accompanied by deep-fried crayfish. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a hot lemon souffle filled with marinated apricots. The dish 
arrived quivering and slowly began to fall -- the sign of greatness in a 
souffle. A small dish of cold caramel parfait, topped with three raspberries, 
came with the souffle. This was as Langbein described it: "A very serious 
restaurant." The prix fixe dinner came to $78 New Zealand each. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever we asked for restaurant recommendations in Auckland, people invariably 
mentioned Moose Lodge in the country near Rotorua. So with only a couple of 
days to spare we decided it might be worth the 2 1/2-hour pilgrimage by car 
south of Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the view it commands out over Lake Rotoiti, Moose Lodge has the 
cooking of Noeline Officer to recommend it. She and her husband Errol own Moose 
Lodge, and Noeline shops each day to gather the ingredients for her exceptional 
dinners that include such specialties as carrot and ginger soup, freshly caught 
fish and desserts such as an apricot dacquoise that is worth traveling any 
distance for. 
</P>
<P>
Noeline willingly shares her recipes, and we took several home. We have seldom 
eaten such food. Everyone gathers for drinks and conversation in the living 
room, then sits at a long table with the Officers in the formal dining room. 
It's like being invited to a great country house for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at Moose Lodge have breakfast and dinner included in the daily rates, 
which are $500 New Zealand a day for two. 
</P>
<P>
But all dining discoveries in New Zealand don't have to be grand. Waiting for a 
bus in Rotorua we decided to get a quick lunch in a McDonald's -- something we 
never do in a foreign country. What we found was surprising -- real shakes with 
ice cream and milk and no additives, French fries that really tasted like 
potatoes, even hamburgers that tasted of grilled beef and fresh lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has given us some lasting memories of great meals. 
</P>

TRIP OF THE WEEK: THERE ARE PLENTY OF NUTS IN MERCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

writers/photographers.

<P>
MERCED, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For one thing, it's the place where the nuts come from. Pistachios in 
particular. But this agricultural town perched at the top of the San Joaquin 
Valley also is home to a fine collection of military airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Merced tempts travelers off the California 99 freeway with restaurants 
and motels. But there are other reasons to drop by this small city, which calls 
itself the "Gateway to Yosemite." 
</P>
<P>
History buffs will discover Merced County's recently restored 19th-Century 
courthouse, which has been made into a museum. Car devotees may want to visit a 
private collection of restored vehicles, including one of the oldest-known, 
steam-powered tractors. Airplane lovers will be fascinated by the history found 
in the military planes of Castle Air Museum. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles on California 99, take the Le Grand exit just beyond 
Chowchilla. Follow the Pistachio signs along County 15 three miles to the 
Buchanan Hollow Nut Co., the family-run business of Sharleen and Bob Robson. 
</P>
<P>
Pistachios are grown on 600 acres adjacent to a packing plant where the nuts 
are roasted, salted and bagged for shipment worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The farm also grows walnuts and almonds, and other nuts are purchased locally. 
Some are coated with chocolate and caramel for gift packages. 
</P>
<P>
The Buchanan Hollow Nut Co. is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays 
to 2 p.m. It's closed Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton and other San Joaquin Valley crops are visible as you continue north to 
the first crossroad, Buchanan Hollow Road, and turn left to Plainsburg Road. 
Turn right (north) and look for a small sign offering direction to Brights 
Nursery -- home of Arthur Bright's vehicle collection. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right onto the nursery's private road. It will lead to a huge metal 
building. If the door is locked, go to the nursery office, which is open 
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Bright started collecting vehicles for an exhibit in the 1960s. His 
prize is an Aveling Porter steam tractor built in England in 1873. You'll find 
it among hundreds of tractors, trucks, combines, cars, wagons, motorbikes and 
other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Look for the electric street car from San Francisco, a milk delivery truck, a 
Studebaker freight wagon and a Case threshing machine. Admission to the museum 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
Continue north on Plainsburg Road to Le Grand Road, and turn left to rejoin 
California 99 north to Merced. Continue on the freeway past the city to the 
Buhach Road exit near Atwater, and follow signs two miles to Castle Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Santa Fe Drive to the outdoor display of 34 military planes at 
Castle Air Museum. It's free and open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Before following paths to the planes for close-up views, see wartime 
memorabilia on exhibit in the indoor portion of the museum. You'll see weapons, 
uniforms and escape maps printed on silk for downed pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a copy of "The Flightline" for 25 cents. It contains detailed descriptions 
of the planes on display, which date back to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance you'll see a B-24, which has been carefully restored. While 
18,000 of the bombers were built -- more than any other U.S. combat aircraft -- 
fewer than 15 still exist. 
</P>
<P>
The largest plane at the museum is a B-52 Stratofortress that saw action in the 
Vietnam War. You can view a B-29 Superfortress, like the one that dropped the 
first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
Also from World War II is a B-25 Mitchell, made famous by Lt. Col. Jimmie 
Doolittle on bombing runs over Japan. Only two foreign planes are in the 
collection -- a British Vulcan and a Canadian Canuck. The museum telephone is 
(209) 723-2178. 
</P>
<P>
Rejoin California 99 south to Merced's R Street exit and turn left under the 
freeway to Main Street. Turn right to N Street, and go left to the historic 
Merced County Courthouse. Free tours are offered Wednesday through Sunday from 
1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dedicated in 1875, it was restored at a cost of nearly $1 million. The exterior 
brick walls have been plastered to simulate marble. On the inside, redwood was 
hand-painted to resemble oak or walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Drop by the Merced Chamber of Commerce office, 1880 N St., and pick up a 
walking-tour map of historic buildings and a dining/lodging guide. Hours are 
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Call (209) 384-3333. 
</P>
<P>
For Italian food and patio dining, go to Chianti's on Bob Hart Square. It opens 
at 11 a.m. daily except Sundays, when it opens for brunch at 10 a.m. Other 
restaurants include the Mansion House, which serves Sunday brunch, as well as 
Jordan's Chateau, Buchanan's California Cuisine, Wine Cellar, Branding Iron and 
Eagle's Nest. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle's Nest also serves Sunday brunch and is at the south end of town at 
the freeway exit for Childs Avenue. Just opposite is Merced's largest lodging, 
the Travelodge, which is $42 for a double. Phone (209) 723-3121. 
</P>
<P>
Other accommodations nearby along Motel Drive, include the Best Western Inn; 
$38, double. Call (209) 723-2163. The remodeled Pine Cone Inn is at the other 
end of town at the V Street exit. Doubles are $58; call (209) 723-3711. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Merced is 560 miles.

CONSUMER REPORT: SOFT ADVENTURES EASY ON TOURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The words "soft adventure" and "ecotourism" are new to the vocabulary of 
travel, being freely used in promotional material even though their meaning 
isn't always clear. 
</P>
<P>
Soft adventure is a less strenuous form of adventure travel, with varying 
parameters. Ecotourism involves travel that relates to environmental/ecological 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The two terms aren't necessarily related, though soft adventure travel can be 
part of an ecotourism trip," said Leslie Jarvie, director of environmental 
programs for Sobek Expeditions in Angels Camp, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecotourism travel is designed to educate people on specific subjects and 
areas, and we use soft adventure experiences as a form of activism to heighten 
the awareness of people on the areas visited." 
</P>
<P>
Soft adventure can mean such travel experiences as staying with primitive 
tribes in northern Thailand, observing sea turtles on Costa Rican beaches, 
scouting polar bears in northern Canada and sailing to Antarctica or the 
less-visited South Pacific islands. 
</P>
<P>
One may hike, bike, white-water raft or simply watch wildlife, all the while 
staying in hotels and camps with special amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"Soft adventure is really striking a balance between hard adventure and more 
traditional packages," said Dyanne Durgar of Seattle-based Imagine Travel 
Alternatives, a firm offering soft adventure programs to such countries as 
Costa Rica and Belize. 
</P>
<P>
A similar definition came from Charles Kao, vice president of Santa 
Monica-based Speed Travel, which offers soft-adventure packages to Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"Soft-adventure trips can be for anyone who likes the outdoors or who wants to 
see rural life, and not just the familiar big-city destinations, and is in good 
health," Kao said. "One doesn't need an experience or background in the 
particular activity." 
</P>
<P>
Some soft-adventure trips also can combine the usual big cities with more 
off-beat destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Doing without some comforts, though, is often a characteristic of this type of 
travel. And the degree of exertion needed to participate is another key issue 
that travelers should resolve before buying such a package. 
</P>
<P>
"Travelers should ask such questions as how much walking or climbing is 
necessary," Durgar said. "While accommodations are clean and comfortable, they 
also tend to be smaller and without all the services of large hotels. So 
travelers should also ask if they will have private baths and if there will be 
hot water. Some places might not always have hot water." 
</P>
<P>
Also, travelers may have to share rooms. "We match people and discourage single 
occupancy," Durgar said. "There isn't even a single-supplement option in our 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Although people may want to explore on their own, travelers should understand 
that they may have to eat and take part in activities on a group basis, Durgar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An example of pace comes from San Diego-based Baja Expeditions, which offers 
such programs as mountain bike touring and sea kayaking in Baja, as well as Sea 
of Cortez cruises. 
</P>
<P>
"Our literature explains that these mountain bike tours cover 20 to 25 miles a 
day at a comfortable pace," said Kent Madin, the company's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The tours are geared for both experienced mountain bikers and beginners. More 
experienced bikers can cover more miles, which is usually by riding ahead or 
going off the main road and exploring on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Other questions to ask about such trips are if there are support vehicles, if 
there is a base camp and how far from it participants wander each day? 
</P>
<P>
"Travelers should ask what happens if they get tired or want to bail out for 
some reason and just be a couch potato for the rest of the trip," Madin said. 
"We always provide an escape hatch where people can quit if they want." 
</P>
<P>
Baja Expeditions includes a passenger van that accompanies the cyclists, as 
well a four-wheel-drive truck to carry equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers should also understand that companies select pictures for their 
brochures that dramatize and enhance their offerings. "However, the animals and 
weather don't always perform on cue," Madin said. "We can't control 
environmental factors, and you can't always pat a gray whale. The idea of 
adventure is to be open-minded and not have a preconceived notion of what is 
supposed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The types of travelers going in for soft adventure also is changing, according 
to Scott Fasken, owner and operator of Idaho Float, which runs outdoor vacation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We get many more families now," Fasken said. "This kind of experience isn't 
seen as just a macho activity for beer-drinking buddies. Food is still a major 
misconception, with people thinking they'll just get beans, franks and 
hamburgers, whereas we serve a lot fancier food, including steaks, chicken, 
fresh salads and fruits." 
</P>
<P>
The level of comfort is also underrated, Fasken said. "While our clients sleep 
in tents, they have large air mattresses that are self-inflating. We also carry 
along dining tables and lawn chairs for dining and cocktails. This isn't 
camping out Boy Scout-style." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of ecotourism can also be misunderstood, according to Durbar. "This 
is a pat expression, so we don't use it. What it means is an emphasis on 
travelers being especially respectful of an area and as unobtrusive as 
possible. Travelers should ask those who use the term how they're backing up 
the concept. Is anything concrete being done?" 
</P>
<P>
Questions to ask for ecotourism trips are: What special training do the guides 
have? Will any specialists or authorities on the subject or area accompany the 
group during the experience? 
</P>
<P>
To show support for the concept of ecotourism, Durbar said her firm donates 1% 
of gross revenues for each tour to such organizations as the Costa Rica 
Conservation League and the Belize Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
Baja Expeditions provides aid to research in Baja California and the Sea of 
Cortez through complimentary shuttle service and equipment to 
research/conservation teams in the area, and co-sponsoring conferences on Baja 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Sobek Expeditions has begun a policy this year of structuring tax-deductible 
donations to the Rainforest Action Network, a nonprofit organization working to 
save the world's rain forests, for five of its ecotourism packages covering 
rain forests in Brazil, Indonesia, Nepal, Costa Rica and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients will be donating $250 to $400, depending on the trip," Jarvie said.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: TAKING A STROLL AMONG PARIS' BABY BOUTIQUES 
</P>

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parisians pick up fashion flair at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in French children's fashion is on personal style. Tots to teens, 
guided by their parents' sense of chic, can choose togs ranging from the 
classical -- items such as hand-smocked dresses for girls and two-piece suits 
with short pants and knee socks for boys -- to the contemporary, loose-fitting 
ensembles made up of mix-and-match elements in a profusion of patterned 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the finest quality and most innovative French children's fashions are 
not yet sold on this side of the Atlantic. Others, including well-known labels 
such as Bonpoint and Jacadi, are available in the United States, in better 
department stores and children's specialty shops. However, Parisian shops offer 
a more complete selection at prices about a third less than in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
This city has several clusters of children's boutiques. Here's a boutique-hop 
by district or arrondissement: 
</P>
<P>
On the Right Bank, in Paris' premier fashion quarter, babies begin their lives 
in haute style at Baby Dior (28 Ave. Montaigne), the source for Dior diapers 
(from $40 U.S.), bunting suits (from $80), lacey baby shifts (from $120) and 
christening gowns (from $150), plus rattles, booties, bonnets, blankets and a 
tiny stuffed bunny made of real rabbit fur. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, D. Porthault (18 Ave. Montaigne), best known for fabulous linens, has 
magnificent layette furnishings and classical clothing for toddlers. Outfits 
cost about $150 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Caddie Montaigne (38 Rue Francois 1er), a very well-organized boutique for 
infants to teens, with larger sizes on the basement level, has preppy fashions 
for the young country club set. 
</P>
<P>
Most adventurous of all are the chic jump suits (from about $68) constructed of 
parachute material in colorful hues. There are also some very attractive 
quilted jackets (from about $100) that can be worn for play, as well as for 
dressier occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Bonpoint (15 Rue Royale and other locations throughout Paris), a chain of 
high-fashion children's boutiques owned by two sisters of perfumer Annick 
Goutal, is chic without being pretentious. The shop coordinates children from 
head to toe with formal, expensive and well-made clothing, designed to stay in 
style rather than crash with the latest fashion wave. 
</P>
<P>
This might seem an odd approach since children outgrow clothes so rapidly, but 
Bonpoint's make-it-to-last philosophy is quite practical. When you're paying 
about $160 for a cotton dress for a 6-month-old, or about $400 for a 
4-year-old's, you may want them to clothe more than one child. 
</P>
<P>
Bonpoint's little skirts (from about $50), trousers (from about $60), suits 
(from about $90) and sweaters (from about $50) are ideal hand-me-downs to be 
shared by several generations of kids with hardly a wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Jacadi (17 Rue Tronchet and other locations throughout Paris), also well known 
in the United States for style and quality, offers dresses with smocking (from 
about $50) and suits (from about $70) and sports ensembles (from about $50 per 
outfit) for well-dressed children from newborns to 16. 
</P>
<P>
More moderately priced than those at Bonpoint, the clothes can be dressy, but 
they're not so formal that they make kids look like adults in miniature. Shoes, 
ranging in price from about $10 for leather baby shoes to $80 for dressy 
styles, are a specialty. Jacadi has a discount shop at 119 Rue d'Alesia in the 
14th Arrondissement. 
</P>
<P>
Tartine et Chocolat (89 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore), a chain of delightful 
children's boutiques owned and run by Catherine Painvain, has its own line of 
fashions that are just becoming known in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the label's charm comes from the distinct use of fabrics, ranging from 
the pale blue-and-white signature pattern to quilted floral prints sewn into 
little suits. Other outfits are covered with splashy, big pink elephants or 
diminutive white mice or cheerful bouquets of daffodils and irises -- 
light-hearted and lovely fashion that should keep both children and their 
parents amused. 
</P>
<P>
Prices start at about $80 per outfit, tots to 14-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Le Petit Eclaireur (84 Ave. des Champs Elysees, Galerie des Champs, lower 
level) is a multi-brand boutique for tots to teens, with a fine selection of 
trendy labels, including Miki House, Tratinette and Marithe &amp; Francois 
Girbaud's children's line. The sales staff is unusually helpful and patient. 
Prices from about $50 per outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Seine, on the artsy Left Bank, Cacaotine (25 Rue Dauphine) features 
terrific play clothes, including little denim suits (from about $48) and 
colorful cotton shirts (from about $28), for kids from infancy to 12 years. The 
diminutive patent leather shoes (from about $30) are a delight. 
</P>
<P>
Petit Faune (33 Rue Jacob and 89 Rue de Rennes) is a bundle of clothing joy for 
tots, from newborns to 4-year-olds. The little knit suits with lace collars 
(from about $70) are purely Pierrot in inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Pastel colors and soft fabrics, lacey sleepers and cuddly bunting abound. There 
are also music dolls, music bears and music pillows (from about $40) to sooth 
stubborn children into sleep. The shop on Rue de Rennes has patterns, yarns and 
fabrics with which to made these delightful clothes yourself, at substantial 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
Scapa of Scotland (71 Rue des Saints Peres) offers tots to teens a selection of 
diminutive versions of Scottish Highland styles by designer Brian Redding. 
There are little kilts in classic tartans (from about $50), Oxford shirts (from 
about $26), V-neck sweaters (from about $60) and bow ties. The French love this 
look for kids. 
</P>
<P>
La Petite Gaminerie (28, 30 and 32 Rue du Four) is a warren of three small 
storefronts, where kids of all ages are covered for clothes. Infants from 
newborn to 6-year-olds are outfitted with tiny designer styles (from about $75 
per outfit) with Cacharel and other top labels. Gifts for newborns are found at 
No. 30. Juniors up to the age of 14 can buy school, sport and dress clothes at 
No. 32, from about $95 per outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Francoise Ezanno's (4 bis Rue du Cherche Midi) styles are adorable. There are, 
for example, red quilted coats with Christmas tree linings (from about $85), to 
be worn with green felt hats (from about $30), as well as tot-size argyle socks 
(about $9) to be worn with color-coordinated woolen pedal pushers (about $58) 
with matching suspenders (about $18). These chic little outfits show great 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Boutique Chantal Goya (17 Rue du Cherche Midi), the splashy boutique owned by 
the famous singer, has little leather coats (from about $170) to be worn with 
preppy plaid dresses (from $75) and suits (from $90), with matching travel and 
school bags. The windows of this shop are always attractive and amusing. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16th Arrondissement, the bastion of the "bon chic, bon genre" set, has 
its outposts of Bonpoint (64 Ave. Raymond Poincare) and Jacadi (7 Rue Gustave 
Courbert). In addition, Bambolino (51 Rue de Passy) provides wealthy Parisians 
with clothes just about as smart as any parent would want for his or her 
children. The range includes everything from play clothes to formal garments. 
Check out the tiny tux for about $250. 
</P>
<P>
Kesako (36 Rue de Passy) is trendy and offers discounted prices on leather 
coats (from about $120), knit ensembles (from about $45) and some colorful 
satin dresses that might dress up the local talent show (from about $49). The 
shop's casual atmosphere is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Le Monde des Enfants (63 Rue de Boulainvilliers) has comfortable play clothes 
in bright primary colors to cheer any child's outlook. Jump suits (from abut 
$60) with flower or polo player prints are particularly chic. The shop even has 
its label on watches (about $35). 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, agnes b. (17 Ave. Pierre 1er de Serbie, and 3 Rue du Jour in the 
1st Arrondissement) features the designer's comfortable and very popular 
collection for the family, including the kids. 
</P>
<P>
The loose-fitting layered fashions emphasize wearability and easy care. 
Lightweight knits with polka dots of various sizes, colors and/or geometric 
patterns work together in delightful, slightly dizzying contrast. 
</P>
<P>
Black on white and white on black are favorites, with brighter colors often 
used in the children's versions of each style. Stockings, scarves and other 
accessories finish off the look, with children's outfits priced from about $90. 
</P>

BARGAIN CORNER: TAKING FLIGHT ON INDIA AIR PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If India is in your 1990 travel plans, you might consider some air passes being 
offered by Indian Airlines, a domestic carrier. Its 21-day "Discover India" 
pass, for example, allows unlimited flights throughout the country for $400. 
</P>
<P>
The airline also has regional seven-day "India Wonderfare" passes, one for each 
of four regions -- north, south, east and west. Each pass, priced at $200, 
allows unlimited travel within its region. 
</P>
<P>
A condition of both the national and regional passes is that you can't return 
to any city you've already flown to unless it's for a connecting flight. You 
have a year from the date of purchase in which to start using each pass, which 
are all on a consecutive-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
The passes can be bought in the United States or in India, but must be paid for 
in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Railways offers an Indrail pass for seven to 90 days, which allows 
unlimited rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
The Indrail pass is available with three classes of service: Air-conditioned 
with sleeper, air-conditioned with seat, and non-air-conditioned, second-class. 
On this basis, the pass costs $190, $95 and $45 for seven days; $230, $115 and 
$55 for 15 days; $280, $140 and $65 for 21 days; $350, $175 and $75 for 30 
days; $520, $260 and $120 for 60 days, and $690, $345 and $150 for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 5 travel free, while those 5 to 12 years are entitled to a 
child's pass, which costs about half the adult fare. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy these rail passes in the United States or in India. If bought in 
India, you still have to pay in U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on travel to India, contact travel agents or the 
Government of India Tourist Office, 3550 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 204, Los Angeles 
90010, (213) 380-8855. JACK ADLER

TOWN THAT TELLS TIME ON A ROLEX; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS IS A SMALL PLACE REALLY. IT'S MONEY AND GLITZ THAT MAKE IT 
DIFFERENT AND, FOR MOST, IRRESISTIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills is a small town really, just five square miles of wide streets 
and tall trees and, it seems, a jewelry store on every corner. Beauty shops 
outnumber booksellers 534 to eight. It is easier to find a psychiatrist than a 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 34,000 people call Beverly Hills home and, for the most part, they do so 
with pride. A good number are film stars, corporate executives or millionaire 
immigrants. They tend to be big dreamers and connoisseurs, and they can hold 
serious conversations about such things as poise and savoir-faire. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills' shady lanes are traversed by more Rolls-Royces per square mile 
than anyplace else on Earth. Each year, from off the lot of the Beverly Hills 
dealership, 150 gleaming new models roll out at an average cost of $155,000. 
The dealer reports that these automobiles almost always are driven home by 
white male buyers who already own one. They almost always pay cash. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible in Beverly Hills boutiques to pay $25,000 for a leather jacket, 
$90,000 for a mink blanket. The costliest home is a hillside French chateau 
with 40,000 square feet, a disco, two gymnasiums, a tennis court and two-lane 
bowling alley, now listed for $30 million. The cheapest home is a 1,400-square 
foot structure with one bathroom just inside the city limits, priced to move at 
$665,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wealth provides a moat of sorts. At a time when surrounding cities grapple with 
crime, gang warfare, urban decay, financial deficits, Beverly Hills remains 
what it always has been -- a symbol of the finest in life, of quality and 
social refinement. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were a Camelot on Earth," boasts City Councilman Bob Tanenbaum, "it's 
Beverly Hills, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Under the glossy exterior, Beverly Hills is a complex, often-contradictory 
place, more than just the sum of its price tags. It is as fragile and intricate 
as a Cartier watch, a balance of big-city commerce and small-town quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are there bigger or better parties. Nowhere are the schools so 
consistently excellent. Nowhere are the donations to charity so blessedly 
enormous, or the servants so impeccably dressed, or the swimming pools so 
languidly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Still, renters outnumber homeowners. Democrats outnumber Republicans. Jews 
outnumber Christians. Some of Beverly Hills' children actually qualify for free 
school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The city government is run by 654 employees, most of whom commute each day from 
lesser homes, lesser communities, as far away as the Mojave Desert. Only six 
live in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, most of us just can't afford to buy a house here," said Fire Chief 
William M. Daley, who drives in every morning from Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, some troubles in paradise. Drug abuse and wretched 
extravagance wage a silent, ongoing battle against the forces of philanthropy 
and public service. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills has one of the highest divorce rates in California. On a 
per-capita basis, it ranks among the nation's leaders in plastic surgeons and 
psychiatrists. Bedford Drive, at the base of the foothills, is so crowded with 
psychiatric offices that doctors facetiously refer to it as "Couch Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
"In Beverly Hills, people relate money and financial success with being happy 
-- then they find out it doesn't work that way," said Dr. Jerome L. Oziel, who 
has spent 15 years treating the psyches of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
For some, he said, the problem is being born with a silver spoon -- and 
discovering that it isn't quite good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who will rent a home and try to make it appear as if they own 
the home, or who will lease a very expensive car and try to make it appear that 
they bought the car for cash," Oziel said. "When people fall from grace in 
Beverly Hills, they fall further. When they go bankrupt . . . when they have to 
move out of a $4-million house and move south of Olympic (Boulevard), it's very 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a very small community." 
</P>
<P>
Each day, the city swells to 150,000 or more inhabitants -- bankers, tourists, 
shop owners, maids, gardeners. Then at night, as the professionals return home, 
the gardeners load up their rakes and clippers in pickup trucks; the maids line 
up at the bus stops along Wilshire and Sunset boulevards, heading for 
inner-city Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And, almost with a sigh, Beverly Hills shrinks back to size. 
</P>
<P>
At his shop on Rodeo Drive, Giuseppe Battaglia caters to customers who think 
nothing of spending $15,000 to spruce up their wardrobe. At Battaglia, a pair 
of crocodile shoes is priced (but there are no price tags) at $1,700; a white 
satin shirt costs $600. Italian-made Brioni suits come in plain wool for $2,000 
or with 14-karat gold pinstriping for $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a back-room office, the graying, 79-year-old Battaglia sits within walls of 
floor-to-ceiling mirrors, so that his own image is reflected back on itself a 
thousandfold, smaller and smaller and smaller, into infinity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of the crowd," he will tell you. "I was a genius." 
</P>
<P>
Battaglia goes on to call himself one of the best-looking men of his era, 
claiming that his physique was once the equal of heavyweight boxing champ Mike 
Tyson. He was a gallant womanizer, knighted for his clothing designs by the 
government of Italy, who brazenly came to America in 1950 without knowing a 
soul or a word of English. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, he opened on Rodeo, then just a quiet, difficult street. "The first 10 
years I never drew one penny of salary," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Now Battaglia is a wealthy man, and Rodeo Drive is the spiritual heart of 
Beverly Hills -- "the most staggering display of luxury in the Western world," 
in the words of author Judith Krantz, who re-created the street for the opening 
scene of her novel, "Scruples." 
</P>
<P>
Success really began with a calculated marketing effort in the early 1970s, 
when shop owners chipped in to hire a publicist so they could exploit the 
abundance of celebrity patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, news releases were picked up around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd always see familiar faces coming in and out of here," said Sid Klein, 
who helps his wife run Frances Klein Antique and Estate Jewels. "We had 
everybody -- Charlton Heston, Charles Bronson, Faye Dunaway. The Gabor sisters 
were in all the time. Laurence Olivier. It became easier and easier to get a 
story planted about Rodeo Drive and its affluence and the fact that you'll see 
more Rolls-Royces in 10 minutes than you'll see in Cleveland, Ohio, all year." 
</P>
<P>
In time, nearly all the world's best-known designers were represented -- Gucci, 
Cartier, Chanel, Ralph Lauren, and so on -- as well as a chic assortment of art 
galleries and restaurants. The patrons became a mix of local shoppers and 
jet-setters from Japan, Saudi Arabia, Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
At Cartier, where the average couple buying a wedding ring spend $30,000 to 
$50,000, the largest clientele are members of the entertainment industry and 
Japanese tourists, said manager Maryam Saghatelian. 
</P>
<P>
Like many companies, Cartier has greatly expanded its line, adding high-end 
jewelry such as a $2-million ruby ring. Sales volume has grown 25% to 40% each 
year for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the three-block strip has sent Rodeo Drive lease rates 
soaring, from $1 a square foot in the early 1970s to as high as $14 a square 
foot today. Now, new shops often find they cannot afford the overhead. Turnover 
is high, and competition has further raised standards of service. At one 
clothier, for example, a shopper can order a drink at a complimentary bar and 
sip it in front of a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Drive has never been more successful, but today, like much of Beverly 
Hills, it is making a conscious effort to protect its status. Facing 
unprecedented competition from Los Angeles-based malls such as the Beverly 
Center and Westside Pavilion, the shopkeepers of Rodeo Drive are looking to 
make changes. 
</P>
<P>
Along with landowners and city officials, they have begun studying -- and 
bitterly debating -- an ambitious improvement program that initially was 
expected to bring to Rodeo Drive decorative granite sidewalks, new street 
lights, landscaped medians and more. 
</P>
<P>
Already, however, the estimated $50-million price tag has forced elimination of 
the granite sidewalks. Now a scaled-down, $30-million plan is being reworked in 
anticipation of a City Council vote next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the marketing efforts of Rodeo Drive merchants are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Bijan, a by-appointment-only men's clothing showroom operating in Beverly Hills 
and New York, is spending $9.5 million this year and more the next to advertise 
its own line of clothing and fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
Bijan sells suits for $3,500, mink-lined denim jackets (originally designed for 
Ronald Reagan) for $7,500 and diamond wristwatches for $125,000. An admiring 
competitor grinned as he held up one of the company's slick, $25,000 ads in 
Town &amp; Country -- an ad that shows Bijan himself as a model, laughing 
aloud. 
</P>
<P>
What the ad does not show is the store's location, or how one can find it. It 
is assumed that the sophisticated buyer will know. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the courthouse where actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was convicted of slapping a 
Beverly Hills motorcycle cop stands a tall, nondescript brick building, 
landscaped with trees. Each day, all day, the trash trucks roll in, dumping the 
city's garbage -- seven tons at a time -- onto the huge concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
Until semitrailer trucks arrive at intervals to haul the debris to landfills, 
workers carefully monitor odors, now and then sprinkling a sort of granulated 
perfume around the base of the garbage heap. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're using now is wild cherry," said Kenneth Palmer, a city sanitation 
official. "We've used banana in the past and, I think, citrus." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual practice is just one example of the city's attention to detail, a 
sign of its determination to do the job right. The city machinery of Beverly 
Hills is oiled generously with $110 million in annual revenues -- four times 
most cities its size -- derived mostly from property taxes, sales taxes 
(primarily from the Rodeo Drive district), business-license fees and hotel 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The 654 full-time city employees represent a work force triple that of 
comparably sized Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, the huge staff exists to maintain what residents like to 
call a "village atmosphere." Trees are a civic obsession. In addition to the 
veritable forests that grow in private lawns and gardens, the city itself 
maintains more than 30,000 trees of 50 different species, planted along streets 
and in parks. It works out to nearly one public tree for each resident, all 
carefully matched, years ago, to the scale and character of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Workmen trim them by hand -- no chain saws -- to keep down the noise. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend $2.5 million annually on our trees," Parks Supt. Marcelino G. Lomeli 
said proudly. "Per capita we spend . . . maybe more than any other U.S. city." 
</P>
<P>
The small-town political climate also contributes significantly to the high 
standards of maintenance. A resident who complains about a pothole is likely to 
have connections extending right into the mayor's or city manager's office. As 
one official noted, such a person isn't satisfied to hear a city employee say, 
"We'll get to it." 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know who's going to get to it and when," said Public Services 
Director Richard E. Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
City employees react accordingly. When a pothole was reported recently on busy 
Wilshire Boulevard, the complaint was logged at 1 p.m.; the pothole was fixed 
by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Things that take other communities weeks or possibly even months to respond 
to, we have done within 24 hours," Putnam said. "We're told to check situations 
out and do what's appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"And we know what's appropriate: Fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Police response times in Beverly Hills average less than three minutes, or 
roughly three times faster than it takes police to arrive at the scene of an 
emergency call in nearby Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody hears something in the alley . . . we respond," boasted Beverly Hills 
city spokesman Fred C. Cunningham. "We have a program where if somebody is 
leaving (town) and they report to the Police Department, we'll try and check 
their homes to make sure they're OK. If time permits, (the police) will get out 
and check the doors and make sure everything's locked." 
</P>
<P>
The reputation of Beverly Hills police is one of toughness. Critics express 
fear of the police, citing brusqueness and forcefulness by officers handling 
exactly the kind of traffic stop that earned Gabor a jail sentence. On the 
other hand, few residents fear walking at night. The city averages just two 
murders a year, most of which, because of abundant investigative manpower, are 
ultimately solved. 
</P>
<P>
Burglaries and robberies, however, number in the hundreds. In recent months, 
the city has again fallen prey to a ring of Rolex watch thieves, well-dressed 
men who approach their victims even in broad daylight to steal a $15,000 or 
$20,000 watch, said Police Lt. Robert P. Curtis. The phenomenon first surfaced 
several years ago and reappeared late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They will follow someone home or to a place of business and, as they get out 
of the car, approach them right there, often at gunpoint," Curtis said. "(The 
thieves) demand (a) Rolex watch, often bypassing other valuable property -- 
including money." 
</P>
<P>
Kerman Beriker, general manager of the Beverly Hills Hotel, strolled through 
the lush, Medi terranean-style grounds, past gloriously colored impatiens and 
bougainvillea, past pool-side cabanas where movie moguls orchestrate deals by 
telephone, past workers scrubbing the carpeted outdoor walkway, and entered a 
bungalow featuring its own kitchen, patio, fireplace, fax machine and, not 
least of all, five telephones, including one in the toilet stall. 
</P>
<P>
How much a night? he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A thousand." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, acquired by the sultan of Brunei in 1987 for $200 million, is a 
cornerstone of the community, both socially and historically. 
</P>
<P>
After the turn of the century, city founder Burton E. Green hoped that oil 
under what were then bean fields would bring him vast fortunes. Instead, his 
wells hit water, and he turned to development. 
</P>
<P>
He dreamed of a world-class retreat, and his hotel, opened in 1912, was a Taj 
Mahal in the middle of nowhere -- "halfway between the city and the ocean," as 
one newspaper described it. More precisely, the site was 10 miles west of 
downtown Los Angeles and seven miles from the beach, at the base of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the urban sprawl of Los Angeles and West Hollywood would completely 
enclose the new city, but when Beverly Hills was incorporated, two years after 
the hotel was built, the town had only 550 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Green tried purposefully to woo the rich and famous. Gracefully curved streets 
and estate-size lots were laid out on the flatlands and hillsides surrounding 
the hotel, north of what is now Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The business district, meanwhile, was established just south of the boulevard, 
deliberately encircled by smaller lots intended for shopkeepers and servants. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, that dichotomy remains. 
</P>
<P>
The south half of town, containing more than half the population, generally 
feels an inferiority to the north. On the south live a mix of homeowners and 
apartment dwellers; young professionals and quasi-successes, drawn by the 
prestige of a Beverly Hills address; working parents and old-timers, some of 
them hanging around through the grace of rent-controlled $400 and $500 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In the shadow of enormous wealth, the people of the south sometimes struggle to 
survive. Single parents in some buildings have been known to share rooms or 
even sleep on the floors of tiny apartments so that their children might go to 
Beverly Hills schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Our very first year here, our older daughter was extremely depressed," 
recalled Bella Haroutunian, now a successful manicurist who owned a beat-up, 
10-year-old Pontiac when she moved to Beverly Hills in 1974. Her daughter would 
insist on being dropped off a block from school so that friends would not see 
the ugly, aquamarine automobile. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept telling me, 'Mother, why did you bring me here? I don't belong here. 
My clothes are different. Our car is not the right car.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult," Haroutunian said. 
</P>
<P>
Former pinup girl Jutka Burtman, now in her late 40s, immigrated from Hungary 
and occupies the same Spalding Drive condominium she has owned for 13 years. 
For a while, she was among the affluent, traveling by Rolls-Royce and private 
plane. Then her husband was ruined in business before dying last year of a 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Now Burtman jogs every day with her little dog, Zsa Zsa, and observes a city 
she finds both beautiful and superficial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst city in the world as far as looks and having to be young to 
be noticed," Burtman said. "Everybody wants to keep up with the Joneses. . . . 
The rich, they're never satisfied . . . and not everybody's super-rich. There 
are a lot of big cars (whose owners have) no money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of phoniness, I can tell you. It's sickening." 
</P>
<P>
North of Santa Monica Boulevard, the emphasis on wealth and life style rises to 
stratospheric levels. The homes of the north are showcases with as many as 18 
bathrooms, with tennis courts and pools, with giant master suites and vast 
atriums, with temperature-controlled wine rooms. Typically, each is attended by 
at least two housekeepers, a nanny if there are children, plus platoons of 
gardeners and pool-service men, freeing the true occupants for other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Hotel, shrouded in tall, elegant palms, is a setting for 
innumerable parties, bar mitzvahs, black-tie fund-raisers and, on average, 75 
to 100 weddings a year. Movie stars and wheeler-dealers congregate in the 
pink-and-green environs of the Polo Lounge, where a phone rests at every booth. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to go to the Polo Lounge because everybody goes there and you need to 
be a part of it," explained general manager Beriker. "If you're meeting in the 
Polo Lounge, it automatically gives some credit to that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Beriker sees to it that pool-side hotel guests are handed chilled towels during 
the summer. Frequently, day or night, he and his staff go on scavenger hunts to 
locate that perfect vintage champagne that a guest craves, or to find a record 
album that someone hopes to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"They will come to us and say, 'I want (to rent) a red Ferrari Testarossa and I 
don't want to have more than 5,000 kilometers on the car,' " Beriker said. "Or 
they will say, 'I want (a Mercedes-Benz) 560SL, black, and I want to have not 
more than 300 miles on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't ask why. . . . We manage it." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hughes lived in one of the bungalows for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The larger hotels -- the Beverly-Wilshire, the Beverly Hilton and, just outside 
the city limits, the Century Plaza -- are focal points of Beverly Hills' 
awesome philanthropic efforts. Fund-raising dinners typically draw 800 guests 
at $200 a plate, week in, week out, for causes ranging from cancer research to 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Federation Council, which raises $50 million a year in Los Angeles 
County to fund a variety of charities, draws at least 10% of that from the 
relatively tiny city, said spokesman Ron Rieder. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contributions range from $1 to six figures . . . ," he said. "There's just 
so much wealth there it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, new money has poured in from overseas, particularly from Iran 
and, more recently, Japan. Today more than 40% of Beverly Hills schoolchildren 
are foreign-born, half of those from Iran. Real estate agent Gila Yashari, a 
one-time Iranian beauty contestant, has taken to videotaping expensive 
properties for clients who know very little about Beverly Hills -- except that, 
soon, they will live there. 
</P>
<P>
"People who spend $10 million, half the time they won't even see the house 
they're buying," she said. "They hear about Beverly Hills and that's it -- it's 
sold." 
</P>
<P>
Among the extremely rich, self-indulgence often runs amok. Women have been 
known to dye their poodles pink or blue to match the color scheme of a party. 
Caterer Giovanni Bolla recalls seeing 45 limousines at the first large bash he 
handled 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A more recent event was staged in a rented mansion that once belonged to 
actress Gloria Swanson. Bolla covered half the pool with a dance floor. On the 
tennis court he erected a 45-foot pole festooned with $50,000 worth of red, 
white and blue flashing lights. Twelve bars were set up, serving brand-name 
liquor, and lifts and chains were used to hoist a dozen massive ice carvings 
into place, one of Mt. Rushmore. Preparations for the $40,000 event took a week 
-- as did the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
But the result was that dizzying sense of affluence, that fabulous and 
breathtaking magic, that is Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," said Bolla, "unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Even the human body becomes a creative canvas for aesthetic improvement. Scores 
of plastic surgeons in town specialize in the decorative shaping of nearly 
every anatomical part, including eyelids. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes become jaded. The buyer of a new Rolls-Royce in Beverly Hills 
generally keeps the car no more than five years, racking up 10,000, maybe 
15,000 miles, before trading it in, said Peter Cloke, general manager of Gregg 
Motors Rolls-Royce of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"People become a little bit bored with the color," he explained. "They've 
looked at the car for long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is impressed with such extravagance. Like the silent Indian in 
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," the hired servants tend to nod and obey, 
forming unspoken impressions. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Lopez, 37, a single mother who speaks limited English, was a maid for a 
time in one palatial mansion. Like most maids, who typically earn $350 a week, 
she stayed in the workplace during the week, as did her young daughter. They 
returned on weekends to an apartment in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Among other duties, Lopez was the keeper of the woman's closet, a cavern where 
she sorted dresses by color and kept 60 pairs of shoes lined up like marching 
soldiers -- "high heels with high heels, boots with boots." 
</P>
<P>
Although she spoke kindly of her former employers, Lopez found it an alien 
world, one she was glad to leave come week's end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say, 'Home sweet home,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran butler, requesting anonymity, spoke harshly of a world populated by 
what he called arrogant, self-centered people, their lives frequently marred by 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are monsters -- no morals, no scruples, no one cares about 
anybody else," the butler said. "There are definitely some exceptions, but as a 
whole . . . the people I know (here) are either weird or rude or a combination 
of both." 
</P>
<P>
As children play with dolls and games, Dr. Ada Horwich, a Beverly Hills 
psychological therapist, watches from another room, hidden behind a two-way 
mirror. Often with a parent or two, she observes firsthand, as a scientist in a 
laboratory might, the anxiety and frustration on the faces of the young. 
</P>
<P>
A few are hyperactive. Some crave attention or cheat at games or abuse their 
toy dolls. Some 7- and 8-year-olds regress to baby-talk and pacifiers. 
</P>
<P>
The little playroom horrors make it clear that the rich do not always live 
happily ever after, Horwich said. Children, in particular, often suffer 
emotional problems in Beverly Hills, more so than in most other communities. 
</P>
<P>
The offspring of brilliant, successful people are themselves expected to be 
brilliant and successful. They are taught to hide their emotions, to bury 
insecurities behind a wall of self-assurance. They learn to be competitive 
about cars, clothes, hairstyles, test scores, dates, personal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Bright, sensitive children become this facade," Horwich said. "They get 
praised for their accomplishments, but the real person inside never gets spoken 
to. These are children who are lost, who can't find themselves. . . . It's 
heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, super-achieving parents are often too busy to communicate with their 
children, or the family is shattered by divorce. "It's not unusual for children 
to be left with maids who literally let them do almost anything short of 
burning down the house," said psychiatrist Brian P. Jacks. 
</P>
<P>
Nanny Cindi Seward was hired to care for young children in a home so massive 
that she had her own wing, complete with an elegant kitchen, dining room and 
fully stocked refrigerator. But the job ended painfully after only a month; the 
two children rebelled so violently, trying to win their parents' attention, 
that it seemed they wanted "to murder the nanny," Seward recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why (the parents) wanted kids," she said with disbelief. "I think 
the kids are in therapy now." 
</P>
<P>
Acutely aware of how they fit in -- or do not fit in -- even many adults 
suffer. To the world they show one face, but inside they compare themselves 
unfavorably to more successful neighbors. Beverly Hills psychiatrists say they 
frequently treat depression, anxiety attacks, eating disorders and sexual 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of failure is heightened in such a town, a striving, assertive place where 
everyone seems to have connections in politics, business and community groups. 
So intricately woven is the gossip grapevine that one woman complained, "You 
can't even cheat on your husband." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bradley knows different. Hectic careers, travel and an emphasis on glitz 
and self-indulgence lead naturally into divorce, drug abuse and affairs, said 
the private detective, owner of Superior Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
For Bradley, Beverly Hills truly is a land of opportunity. He has spent 10 
years moving through the town's traffic in an unmarked car, trolling the 
underside. He has tracked rich men who were found to be providing their 
mistresses with cars and apartments . . . neglected wives involved in romantic 
entanglements with gardeners and hairdressers . . . prostitutes . . . dissolute 
parents drinking their way through bitter custody battles . . . spouses locked 
in divorce suits attempting to hide millions of dollars in assets. 
</P>
<P>
At $45 an hour, Bradley has tracked suspected infidels out of state, even out 
of the country. He has worked for paranoid men who -- no matter what, and for 
no apparent reason -- always believe they are being followed. In fact, he has 
followed a few such men himself -- just to make sure that no one else was. 
</P>
<P>
"These rich businessmen, their lives are all messed up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Vinay, a 16-year-old sophomore, sat on a wall outside the campus of 
Beverly Hills High School, decrying the town's prodigal reputation. He finds it 
difficult to admit he's from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"People think you're a snob," he said. "(They think) you spend money all over 
the place." 
</P>
<P>
He is matter-of-fact about owning a car -- a $20,000 Audi. "I liked it, I 
guess, and my dad bought it." 
</P>
<P>
At the high school, certain privileges are expected. Nearly every upper-class 
student owns some sort of vehicle, typically a late-model Honda, Jeep or BMW. 
(The standing joke is that the teachers' lot is easy to find -- it's the one 
with the old cars.) The cafeteria is run by the Marriott Corp., offering 
selections that range from bagels and salads to hamburgers and pizza. 
</P>
<P>
But some students appreciate it more than others. Senior Nick Koskoff, 17, the 
owner of a new Ford Bronco, said his goal after graduating is to get out of 
Beverly Hills. He described the people as gossipy, materialistic and phony. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it here too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Guy Oseary talked differently: "I'm honored to graduate from Beverly 
Hills High. I like it here." His plans? "I'm starting a record label. I work 
for a rapper -- his name's Ice-T." 
</P>
<P>
At the schools, all young Beverly Hills residents, rich or poor, are given a 
chance to excel -- a birthright the town has aggressively guarded. Seventeen 
oil wells on the high school campus pumped enough of Jed Clampett's Texas Tea 
to carry the school district through state educational funding cuts in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
As the price of crude oil fell, city government stepped in. A lopsided 
agreement was drawn up calling for the city to rent school facilities at 
deliberately exorbitant rates. The school district makes available athletic 
fields for use by city recreational programs, for example. In return, the 
district receives rental fees that will total $4.6 million this year alone.

<P>
The money helps to keep class sizes small -- about 10 students fewer than those 
in Los Angeles -- while paying for additional counselors, music teachers and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
A strike by Beverly Hills teachers last fall ended when parents stepped in, 
pledging $600,000 toward salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strike, the report card for the school district is strictly summa 
cum laude: 91st- to 99th-percentile rankings in all subjects and at all grade 
levels, based on statewide exams. No fewer than 94% of high school graduates go 
on to college. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other high school in the country that sends that many people to 
college," Mayor Max Salter said. "It's a spectacular number." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Byrens called the maid to serve coffee cake and gazed out the window 
overlooking her pool and the city below. 
</P>
<P>
The "hysteria" of these old women living up in the hills rankles her, she said. 
As chairwoman of the city's Fine Arts Committee, she still burns over the way 
fearful homeowners rose up, many years ago, to defeat plans to place the 
Hirshhorn art collection in the Greystone Mansion, a colossal, 55-room 
structure that still sits vacant -- a civic white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
For all that it has, Beverly Hills is without a single museum, concert hall or 
sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Beverly Hills, in my opinion, is a cultural wasteland," Byrens said. 
</P>
<P>
But after 40 years, she wouldn't live anywhere else. It is not just the fact 
that she can call the mayor at home, or that friends pass and wave in their 
cars, or that, if she needs money for a phone call, she can stop in any number 
of shops on Rodeo Drive. Nor is it the kindness that neighbors showed -- some 
of whom she hardly knew -- after her son was killed 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The magic of Beverly Hills goes beyond all that. It is an intangible quality, a 
series of gestures over cappuccino, an iridescent evening in a lighted garden. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of life here," she said, "is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Condominium owner Burtman calls the town "a fairyland . . . absolutely 
beautiful. Once you've tasted the good life, it's hard to get used to the other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Those who leave the city generally return, or they try to take a part of it 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry salesman Sid Klein recalled a wealthy German industrialist who once 
visited Rodeo Drive with his beautiful young wife. At Klein's store, they 
eagerly snapped up costly trinkets to the tune of $300,000 and, on the way out, 
spied a $90,000 diamond necklace in the window, which the wife also wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Irritated, the industrialist stalked out. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he called from New York, insisting that Klein and his wife 
bring the necklace, posthaste. Airline tickets were waiting, as was a limousine 
at the airport in New York and a luxury hotel suite. The Kleins delivered the 
diamond necklace secretly, and the industrialist concealed it from his wife 
until late the same night when, in the privacy of their own suite, he hid the 
treasure in the bottom of her champagne glass. 
</P>
<P>
Klein laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that," he said, "is savoir-faire."

PROPOSED PAYROLL TAX CUT ASSAILED BY ROSTENKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, on 
Saturday denounced a fellow Democrat's proposal to cut Social Security payroll 
taxes by $62 billion over the next two years as "irresponsible" and "political 
junk food." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Democrat, a veteran of 31 years in Congress and its chief tax 
writer for almost a decade, also said he may retire in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski acknowledged in a televised interview that legislation to reduce 
capital gains taxes and expand tax breaks provided by individual retirement 
accounts could pass this year, despite his opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But his strong condemnation of the plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.) to cancel 1990 and 1991 increases in Social Security taxes could slow 
the proposal's election-year momentum and demonstrates that congressional 
Democrats are divided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing a tax break to wage earners, Moynihan contends his plan would 
force the government to be more fiscally responsible because the current 
surplus in the Social Security trust fund could no longer be used to reduce the 
federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is strongly opposed by President Bush, who maintains that it would 
require the federal government to increase taxes elsewhere to make up the lost 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) has scheduled 
hearings on Moynihan's legislation while reserving judgment on its merits. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski said House Democratic leaders have decided to order a study of the 
Moynihan plan before deciding whether to endorse it or oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for himself, however, Rostenkowski said: "I see no reason why we 
should surrender those revenues. . . . If you're in the business on Ways and 
Means of trying to find revenues to keep solvency in programs, and you have 
them included and then all of a sudden you surrender them, I think that's 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on CNN's "Evans and Novak" show, Rostenkowski described the Moynihan 
plan and President Bush's separate proposal to cut taxes on capital gains as 
"political junk food." 
</P>
<P>
While House passage of the Moynihan proposal does not appear likely at this 
time, Rostenkowski said, liberals and conservatives could form a coalition that 
would be able to push the measure through the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that the conservative Republicans at first blush suggested they were 
going to endorse it," he said. "I understand, however, that George Bush had 
them down at the woodshed, and the conservatives are becoming more reasonable 
about what they're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
If Social Security taxes are reduced, Rostenkowski said he would favor 
offsetting the tax cut by raising an equal amount of revenues from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
He renewed his support for an increase in the top-bracket income tax rate from 
28% to 33%. Under current law, he noted, taxpayers in the second-highest 
bracket pay a 33% marginal tax rate, but the rate drops to 28% for those with 
family incomes above $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's darn unfair," he said. "I think that's a glitch and we should 
correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Other than that change, however, Rostenkowski said he opposed any "tinkering" 
with the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which reduced income tax rates while eliminating 
many deductions, credits and loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the capital gains cut because in the long run I think it's going 
to cost us money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets. A 
reduction in the tax rate on such gains is expected to raise revenue in the 
short term because it would encourage people to sell assets that they might 
have held otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski conceded that "there may be some arrangement between Democrats and 
Republicans and between the Administration that we might see a capital gains 
cut as well as an expansion of tax-sheltered individual retirement accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Constitution requires that tax bills originate in the House of 
Representatives, Rostenkowski's committee usually plays a strong role in 
shaping revenue-raising legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate can add tax legislation to any House-originated revenue measure, 
thus bypassing the Ways and Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who turned 62 this month, said he is considering leaving Congress 
after the 1990 congressional reapportionment takes effect. Illinois is expected 
to lose two seats, he said, and a few members of Congress from his home state 
with long service records are debating whether it is time to let younger people 
take their place. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't made up my mind," he said. "I love the job and I'd like to 
stay on, but, you know, I owe a little bit to my family." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski has an added incentive to leave. Under current law, he could take 
$1 million in unspent campaign contributions with him when he retires and use 
it for his personal needs. 
</P>
<P>
If he does depart, Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), 70, would be next in line for the 
chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, if seniority is the deciding 
factor.

DEUKMEJIAN STRONGLY BACKS MEDFLY SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: HE SAYS STATE CANNOT SURRENDER TO THE PEST. POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE 
FOR AGRICULTURE CITED. 
</P>

<P>
The Mediterranean fruit fly has proven over the years that not only does it 
have an attraction for 250 varieties of ripe fruit, but also for a few 
varieties of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. faced the pesky fly in 1981 and his 
popularity tumbled because of his hesitation to order aerial pesticide 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nine years later, it appears that the fly is beginning to buzz around Gov. 
George Deukmejian -- ironically, because of his unflinching support for the 
aerial malathion assault. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide radio address Saturday that drew strong criticism from 
anti-spraying forces, the governor defended aggressive efforts by state and 
local agriculture officials to eradicate the fly with repeated nighttime 
helicopter missions. 
</P>
<P>
"California cannot afford to surrender to the Medfly," Deukmejian said in his 
first major speech on the current Medfly crisis. "Allowing this insect to take 
up permanent residency in California would have long-range consequences for 
agriculture and every citizen in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why we intend to proceed with our plan -- a plan which is proven, a 
plan which is safe and a plan which is working." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has supported aerial spraying since he approved an emergency 
eradication program in August, although he has made few public comments beyond 
that move. 
</P>
<P>
He told his radio listeners Saturday that despite criticism from opponents of 
aerial spraying, the state has no choice but to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"If left unchecked, the Medfly infestation has the potential to spread and 
infect virtually every fruit and vegetable crop grown in our state," he said, 
adding that a statewide infestation would require increased pesticide use on 
crops, quarantines on California fruits and a devastating loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we have come to take for granted our stroll through the produce 
sections of California supermarkets," he said. "For agriculture to continue to 
prosper . . . we must help ensure the vitality of our farms, guarantee the 
safety of the food we grow and respond to any threats to this $16-billion 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Spraying opponents were furious, but not surprised, at Deukmejian's comments, 
saying that the governor has put crops before people. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said the agriculture lobby is behind this," said Monterey Park 
Mayor Pat Reichenberger, one of the most vocal critics of aerial spraying. "I 
resent human lives put at risk for an industry that can afford to lose a few 
million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bender, a coordinator of Safe Alternatives to Fruit Fly Eradication (SAFE), 
said Deukmejian said nothing new in his speech and only reiterated the 
"propaganda" spread by the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taken the easy route," Bender said. "If he doesn't say anything, no one 
can criticize him. He's just giving us the same old line." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has been able to avoid much of the criticism for the state's aerial 
campaign by simply not saying much about it and allowing the Food and 
Agriculture Department to assume the lead role. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, former Gov. Brown was initially a vocal opponent of aerial 
malathion spraying. Many political observers believe that his delay in ordering 
aerial spraying made him appear indecisive and helped doom his bid for the U.S. 
Senate in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's speech capped a week of activity by spraying opponents, who have 
become an increasingly vocal and eye-catching political force. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) launched the first major 
political challenge to the state's spraying policy by unveiling two bills that 
would end the repeated flights of malathion-laden helicopters over urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, about 80 demonstrators turned out in West Los Angeles for a 
protest that featured six cast members of the television series "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, attorneys from the Orange County cities of Garden Grove, 
Huntington Beach and Westminster walked into a Sacramento Superior Court in an 
unsuccessful attempt to win an injunction against spraying scheduled that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Wiczynski, deputy city attorney in Garden Grove, said the city intends 
to continue its legal battle to stop the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The state's eradication program has been the largest ever mounted in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
More than 370 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange counties have been 
infested with the fly and about 50 cities have been sprayed so far. 
</P>
<P>
Affected areas are now sprayed every 21 days, but that will jump to every 15 
days in April, and then every seven days in June if the infestation continues. 
State officials say some cities may be sprayed up to 12 times by the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
According to state officials, if the Medfly escapes into California's fertile 
Central Valley, the bug could cause more than $200 million in crop damage each 
year. The threatened fruit, nut and vegetable crops are estimated to be worth 
about $5 billion a year, according to the state.

SHE COUNSELS PRISONERS AWAITING AIDS SENTENCE 
</P>

AIDS may be the loneliest disease in the world, and Donalyn Gross said there is 
probably no lonelier place than prison to die of it, away from family and 
friends and shunned by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Since Gross began work at Somers State Prison two years ago as a thanatologist 
counseling inmates with AIDS, she has watched 18 of her patients succumb to the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Dying of AIDS on the outside is one thing, but dying in prison, it's tough. 
It's really tough," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, who believes she is the only death counselor in a U.S. correctional 
facility, spends her days in the prison's chronic ward, otherwise known as the 
AIDS ward, with rapists, murderers and drug dealers. She laughs, cries and 
shares secrets with them, trying to make death a little less frightening. 
</P>
<P>
State prison officials estimate that about 15% of the state's inmates carry the 
AIDS virus, according to Corrections Department spokesman Bill Flower. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, a resident of Springfield, Mass., got her first exposure working with 
the dying when she volunteered at a nursing home at age 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a lot of people dying alone with no families," she said, recalling 
one woman who would sit alone in her wheelchair day after day with no visitors. 
</P>
<P>
When the woman died, Gross went to her funeral and was stunned to find a church 
full of mourners. The woman did, in fact, have family and friends -- they just 
weren't with her at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Gross has discovered that it's even more true of inmates at Somers, 
Connecticut's only maximum-security prison. Many of them were abandoned by 
their families before they became sick, but when the symptoms of AIDS became 
pronounced, even fewer people wanted to visit them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fear of contracting AIDS has made others shy away from AIDS 
patients, Gross said it was acquired immune deficiency syndrome that drew her 
to Somers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd worked with cancer patients for 12 years, and when AIDS came along I knew 
I wanted to get involved," she said. "I looked all over the place, and then 
someone suggested the prisons." 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts prison officials weren't responsive to the idea, but Connecticut 
officials were willing to give her a try at Somers, just over the state line. 
</P>
<P>
She started as a volunteer at Somers, then was given a contract. She now spends 
five days a week at the prison and is on call at all times. 
</P>
<P>
As devastating as cancer is, Gross said AIDS is worse: "Cancer seems so much 
gentler than AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said an inmate enters the chronic ward on the brink of death. When he 
gets really bad, he is taken to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in 
Hartford. After intense treatment he returns, thinner and weaker but still 
alive, waiting for the next onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard thing with something like AIDS is that it can go on for so long," 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Some inmates are so afraid of the AIDS stigma that they deny they are sick, 
even at the risk of not getting the new medical treatments known to help AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
On her way to and through the ward, guards and inmates alike smile and wave. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, five inmates were living in the nine-bed ward. Three were watching a 
sitcom on television. Two lay in bed on the other end of the room, 
uninterested. 
</P>
<P>
One, not unlike others Gross has worked with, collects news articles on AIDS 
and devours all the literature he can find on the disease. Gross helps, 
bringing in articles and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
Recently she brought in a tape about the giant AIDS quilt, for which people 
from all over the country have sewn panels in memory of someone they loved and 
lost to the disease. The video depressed some of the inmates, but they 
discussed it and felt better in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Gross tries to help the inmates come to terms with impending death without 
overwhelming them with gloom. "We'll discuss funerals, but I won't push it." 
</P>
<P>
Prison policy prevents inmates from being interviewed, but a note Gross 
received from an inmate after he had been rushed to St. Francis Hospital 
provided a glimpse into what her friendship means to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay here with me," he wrote. "I'm scared and lonely." 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Gross said she is not frightened by working with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say, 'Aren't you afraid?' " she said. "Some of the guys, I don't 
even know what they're in here for. I'm not here to judge. I'm here to give 
them some compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is she worried about getting AIDS herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit on the bed and I give them back rubs," Gross said. "I never wear a mask. 
I don't like to do that. It's like having the plague. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a cut on my hand and I'm going to give someone a back rub, I'll put 
a Band-Aid on it. If I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Gross credits Somers for being progressive enough to allow her to work with its 
dying inmates, and Somers credits Gross for taking on the task. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an extremely good program and one that is beneficial to the clients that 
she serves in ways that I can't even begin to imagine," said corrections 
spokesman Flower. "It's a humanitarian program, a compassionate program and 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Although new inmates at Somers get a lecture about AIDS and how it is spread, 
Gross said many are too macho to listen. She thinks the number of dying inmates 
will only increase, particularly as prisons become more overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
Gross thinks more death counselors could make the situation easier. With that 
in mind, she has written prison officials across the country to urge them to 
come up with money for such positions. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she'll continue offering solace to the dying. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody's dying, I spend as much time with them as I can," she said. 
"When someone dies, I feel sad because I got close to that person, but I feel 
good because I know I did what I could. And then I've got to get up and go on 
to the next person. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my guys."

ARCHEOLOGISTS DATE FARMING IN N. AMERICA TO 2000 BC; 
</P>
<P>
PREHISTORY: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE EARLY ABORIGINAL PEOPLES OF EASTERN NORTH 
AMERICA WERE MORE ADVANCED THAN BELIEVED, AND THAT THE AREA WAS ONE WHERE 
AGRICULTURE DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN OKIE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists have found evidence that the prehistoric Indians of eastern North 
America began growing several kinds of wild plants for food as long as 4,000 
years ago, and they were farming their own native crops for hundreds of years 
before maize, or corn, was first brought here from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The new evidence establishes the region as one of the half-dozen areas of the 
world where agriculture is now thought to have originated independently. The 
findings, which rely on technological advances that can measure the age of 
single seeds and can detect subtle changes in plants produced by domestication, 
challenge a longstanding belief that early North Americans learned farming 
techniques from their more technologically advanced southern neighbors, who are 
known to have domesticated corn and squash. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears now that eastern North America was largely independent from any 
substantial cultural influence from Mexico or other parts of Central America," 
said Bruce D. Smith, an archeologist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
Natural History who described the new findings in a recent issue of the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
The plants that these early farmers domesticated include sunflower; 
lamb's-quarter or goosefoot, a common farm and garden weed; sumpweed or marsh 
elder, a cousin of the sunflower that grows in boggy ground; and Cucurbita 
pepo, a hard, baseball-sized gourd, that was the ancestor of today's acorn 
squash. All were grown for their edible seeds, although Smith said the gourds 
were also used as containers. 
</P>
<P>
By about 250 BC, the archeological evidence suggests the repertoire of seed 
crops had expanded to include "little barley," maygrass and erect knotweed, a 
plant that Smith said survives today only on an island in Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
The transition from simply gathering wild seeds to saving and planting them, 
and from there to growing substantial quantities for food spanned several 
thousand years. Smith said the plants themselves probably helped things along 
because all were opportunists likely to spring up unaided in the disturbed 
ground around early settlements. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, it doesn't appear to have been a very deliberate or high-energy 
input by humans at all," he said. "You could almost ask, 'Who's running the 
show, the plants or the people?' " 
</P>
<P>
When a patch of sunflowers or wild gourds cropped up near a settlement, the 
initial response of the inhabitants was probably to pick the seeds and perhaps 
to keep the patch weeded, Smith suggested. "From there, it's a relatively small 
step, but a very important one, for people to save some of the seeds they 
harvested over the winter and to try to expand the stands of plants that were 
already growing there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For sunflowers, gourds, marsh elder and lamb's-quarter, Smith and other 
researchers have been able to determine roughly when eastern woodland Indians 
took the critical step of sowing seeds and, in effect, domesticating the wild 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
They can tell because when a plant is cultivated, certain environmental factors 
promote changes in its seeds' size and structure. Seeds that germinate quickly 
and produce tall seedlings tend to do best. They beat out slower-growing plants 
and are the ones that farmers harvest to eat and to plant again. 
</P>
<P>
This selection process -- a human-powered version of natural selection -- 
favors certain traits in the plants. Selection makes a plant evolve larger 
seeds with thinner coats, characteristics that are not advantageous for wild 
varieties. When these traits are found, they are taken as signs of 
domestication. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists' ability to find, date and examine prehistoric seeds has been 
dramatically enhanced in recent years by new technologies, some quite simple. 
One technique is water flotation, in which dirt from ancient settlements is 
dumped into a barrel of water and plant material floats to the top where it is 
skimmed off. The method has allowed archeologists to recover seeds much more 
efficiently than the old method of sifting the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
More sophisticated is a technique called accelerator mass spectrometry, which 
allows researchers to use much smaller amounts of material than were formerly 
needed to obtain radiocarbon dates for seeds, bones and other organic objects 
from ancient settlements. By measuring the amount of a radioactive form of 
carbon, which is present in all living things, they can estimate the age of a 
seed weighing one-thousandth of a gram with a margin of error of about 100 
years either way. 
</P>
<P>
By measuring seeds and looking for such changes with a scanning electron 
microscope, Smith and other researchers have found evidence that inhabitants of 
settlements in west-central Illinois, Kentucky and east Tennessee were growing 
sumpweed, gourds, sunflowers and lamb's-quarter by about 2000 to 1500 BC. 
</P>
<P>
It took more than a thousand years for inhabitants of eastern North America to 
move from small-scale gardening to raising crops to store for later 
consumption. Based on evidence such as the finding of large amounts of edible 
seed at settlement sites, as well as storage vessels and primitive farm 
implements, Smith dated the appearance of such early food-producing economies 
to between 250 BC and AD 200. In settlements of that period, he said, "all of a 
sudden in different areas of the east you start to find a lot of these seeds." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said cooking seems to have made an advance at around the same time, with 
the development of ceramic vessels that people could use to boil seeds and make 
gruel or stew. Earlier cooks had to be content with simply parching seeds in a 
fire to break the tough outer coating so they could be chewed and digested. 
</P>
<P>
Learning to grow seed crops probably helped aboriginal North Americans get 
through the winter, but it did not turn them from hunter-gatherers to farmers 
overnight, Smith said. Centuries after farming arose, they were still using 
seed crops mainly to supplement a diet that depended chiefly on wild animals, 
waterfowl, fish, and nuts, seeds or berries from wild plants. 
</P>
<P>
Maize, once thought to be the plant that brought farming to North America, 
actually was a latecomer. It arrived in the area around AD 200, but for unknown 
reasons, it did not become a staple crop until about six centuries later, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One traditional explanation is that the woodlands of central and eastern North 
America provided such abundance and variety for so long that the drudgery and 
dietary monotony of farming could be resisted longer than elsewhere.

<P>
While Orange County experienced a 125% increase in pilot-reported near 
collisions in 1989, the skies above Los Angeles County saw a sharp drop in such 
incidents, according to Federal Aviation Administration documents. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized list showed that pilots reported 18 near midair collisions in 
the skies over Orange County through Nov. 5, 1989, up from eight during all of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the number of near midair collisions in Los Angeles County 
declined from 36 incidents during the first 10 months of 1988 to 19 during the 
same period in 1989 -- a 47% decrease, according to FAA reports obtained by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Williams, manager of the Flight Standards Division of the FAA's Western 
Pacific Region, attributed the drop in Los Angeles County to an intensive 
education program for both professional and private pilots and the adoption of 
new visual flight rule charts. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to air carrier pilots about where they are likely to find general 
aviation operations," Williams said. "And, we talked to general aviation pilots 
about where they can expect air carrier operations." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said new charts -- adopted recently -- clearly show private pilots the 
routes to use in flying into the Los Angeles Basin. Previous charts were 
complicated by flight information showing general aviation pilots where they 
should not fly. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA list was compiled by the Office of Safety Analysis in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that, statewide, the number of incidents reported by pilots dropped 
36.5%, from 170 in all of 1988 to 108 through Nov. 5, 1989. The data for the 
period after Nov. 5, will not be available until next week, but it is unlikely 
to change the established pattern, FAA officials said. Referring to the 
dramatic increase reported for Orange County, a veteran airline pilot said 
there are simply too many additional aircraft using the air space each year. 
</P>
<P>
"You have all of the ingredients for a tremendous number of midair collisions," 
said Dick Russell, a veteran airline pilot who serves on the safety committee 
of the Washington-based Air Line Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Russell said the number of near midair collisions is vasty understated because 
pilots do not report all of them. 
</P>
<P>
But other pilots and air traffic controllers said the increase in near midair 
collisions is puzzling because their personal experience suggested that 
incidents were declining. They also cautioned that the public should not view 
the numbers literally, because the number of reported near midair collisions 
often swings substantially from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, pilots reported 28 near midair collisions over Orange County in 
1987, but only 17 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the incidents have not been verified, FAA officials said, because the 
second aircraft involved could not be identified and the pilot of that plane 
was not interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, the FAA reported 10 near midair collisions in 1988. Four 
of those involved military aircraft, including sophisticated F-16 Navy 
fighters. The county has several Navy and Marine airfields, including the famed 
Top Gun fighter pilot's school at Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Figures available for the first 11 months of 1989 show a 50% reduction in 
reported incidents. According to FAA figures, four of the five near misses 
reported during that period involved military aircraft, including a June 15 
incident in which a KC-135 tanker came within 2,550 feet of a DC-10 passenger 
jet, while flying at 28,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Vaughn, air traffic manager for San Diego terminal approach radar control 
(TRACON), credits the relatively small number of incidents in the county to a 
tough policy that requires approaching aircraft to get clearance from air 
traffic controllers before they can venture into local airspace. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego policy uses a tactical control area (TCA). Orange County did not 
have a similar policy until this month, when air traffic controllers instituted 
the airport radar service area (ARSA), Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under TCA, entry into airspace requires air traffic control authorization," 
Vaughn said. "The TCA uses more stringent separation criteria for airplanes. . 
. . I don't really know that we did anything different in 1989, other than we 
also have a very active pilot education program." 
</P>
<P>
Some officials cast doubt on the validity of the data. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have an explanation for the reported increase," said James H. 
Panter, air traffic manager at the Coast Terminal Approach Radar Control Center 
in El Toro. That center handles aircraft in the Orange County-Long Beach area. 
"Nor, by the way, does it sound correct. I haven't noticed any significant 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
Panter said the number of pilot reports varies year to year in part because 
sometimes pilots are more prone to notify the FAA during a major safety push, 
or right after a disaster such as the Cerritos air crash in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Many near midair collisions aren't really what they seem to be," Panter said. 
"If two pilots flying under visual flight rules come close together but one 
avoids the other, they did exactly what they were supposed to do and nothing 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
In many instances of reported near misses, Panter added, one pilot's subjective 
view of how close the two aircraft came together is all the FAA has to go on. 
Many aircraft flying under visual flight rules are not in contact with air 
traffic controllers, he said, and thus cannot even be warned that they are too 
close together. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what (radio) frequency they're on, and unless they have a 
transponder, we don't know their altitude either," Panter said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the FAA uses the near midair collision data by placing red pins on a 
map to show areas that seem to have clusters of incidents. Such clusters, he 
said, may indicate the need for an air safety meeting to advise pilots of a 
particular problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it's hard to get a handle on this data," Panter said. "It should 
not be taken literally." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Moore, an air traffic controller at the Coast Radar Control Center and 
immediate past president of the local National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. 
chapter, said the increase reported for Orange County skies may be a result of 
airline pilots campaigning for creation of a new safety zone around John Wayne 
Airport that was put into effect earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Those figures just support the ARSA (airport radar service area)," Moore 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the controllers' group would like to see a terminal control area 
covering Orange County and requiring pilots to obtain entry permission from an 
air traffic controller. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done some figuring, and as far as the (controllers') union goes, we feel 
if we had a TCA it would cut down 94% of the near midair collisions." 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board last year issued a report strongly 
critical of the Coast Radar Control Center for being understaffed and using 
outmoded equipment and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA, however, disputed the findings and pointed to several improvements 
that had been made at the facility and a recruitment program that has been 
attracting additional controllers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Coast Radar Control Center is scheduled to be merged into a new 
facility near San Diego that will handle the entire Southern California area. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, officials of the federal General Accounting Office reported that the 
skies above Orange County ranked seventh in the nation in near midair 
collisions involving air carriers during the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
Panter -- who flies a small Cessna -- said that the Coast Radar Control Center 
has been handling record numbers of aircraft flights -- about 2,000 a day, 
about double the workload of five years ago, but he said that not all of the 
increase is due to air carriers, which must stay in contact with his facility. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Michael C. Church, president of the Orange County Airport Assn., an 
influential pilots' group, questioned whether the increase in incidents 
reported for Orange County between 1988 and 1989 might not be heavily 
influenced by numbers of air carrier operations and the subjective nature of 
such incident reports. 
</P>
<P>
Church, a flight instructor at John Wayne Airport, said that pilot reports are 
based much more "on opinion than actual fact." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics should be used to educate pilots about problem areas, he said, 
but not for more restrictive measures that may be merely good public relations 
gestures.

VAN DE KAMP, WILSON TARGET ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Republican candidate for governor is bound to propose an executive approach 
to California environmental issues. A Democrat can be expected to call for new 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
And that is exactly what Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and Democratic Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp did Saturday as each addressed Heal the Bay, a group 
dedicated to cleaning up Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson promised to create a state Environmental Protection Agency that would 
get tough on polluters, bar offshore oil drilling and take the regulation of 
pesticides away from the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp touted his ballot initiative, which would enact sweeping changes in 
the law to protect the environment, and once again called on Wilson to endorse 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson, who spoke earlier, had already told the group that he thought Van 
de Kamp's initiative was too broad and that he especially objects to its 
creation of an environmental advocate who would have the power to buck the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"As governor, I will be the environmental czar; you don't need another one," 
Wilson told the 300 conferees at Mount Saint Mary's College in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson reminded those attending the Heal the Bay conference that his 
environmental record goes back to his role in creating the state Coastal 
Commission when he was a freshman state assemblyman 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a U.S. senator, Wilson continued, he has challenged the Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush administrations' desire to drill for oil off the California coast. 
And, perhaps most familiar to those present Saturday, Wilson was a leader of 
the bipartisan effort that in 1988 defeated Occidental Petroleum's plan to 
drill for oil near the Pacific Palisades shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's speech drew strong applause at the end, but interviews with some of 
those present indicated that Wilson did not allay the long-held suspicions that 
some environmental activists have for Republican politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good speech as far as it went, but he's got this problem: He's a 
Republican," said Cydney Mandel, who works with a group called Not Yet Miami, a 
reference to its desire to stop the building of big hotels on Los Angeles 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is finding Republicans to join our groups," said Lu Haas, 
an environmentalist who has been an adviser to two California governors. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it always is in politics, there was the smell of money behind Wilson 
and Van de Kamp's different positions Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has always raised much of his money from corporate and large 
agricultural concerns, so he is not likely to support Van de Kamp's call for 
sweeping changes in the law. Business groups say they have seen too many 
examples of regulation hurting existing businesses and discouraging new ones 
from locating in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, on the other hand, has the kind of liberal Democratic pedigree 
that is not likely to attract huge contributions from agribusiness, or from 
some other corporations. 
</P>
<P>
For his campaign money in the governor's race, Van de Kamp must depend in part 
on the well-heeled residents of Santa Monica and West Los Angeles neighborhoods 
who often make the environment their No. 1 priority. So his remarks Saturday 
probably got more than applause -- they no doubt got him votes as well as 
potential campaign contributions.

NEW INTERVIEW TOOLS HELP CRIME VICTIMS, WITNESSES RECALL MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, the woman couldn't remember if the suspicious-looking man she saw 
near the murder scene wore any jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes later, as she concentrated on her recollection of him turning 
his head to the side, she remembered a gold earring. 
</P>
<P>
That memory helped solve the case, said psychologist Ronald Fisher, who 
interviewed her at the request of police. The payoff came from an experimental 
technique called the cognitive interview, aimed at getting crime victims and 
witnesses to remember more than under standard police questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The technique is one of several contributions psychology researchers hope will 
help solve crimes and convict criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this work has been done only in laboratories. But the cognitive 
interview recently showed promise in a real-world test with detectives at the 
Metro-Dade Police Department in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
It "proved to be real fruitful," said Police Sgt. Jim Wander. "The guys who 
took part in it are appreciative of the results, and I think they're probably 
better detectives overall as a result of it." 
</P>
<P>
Results were reported in the October issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology 
by Fisher and Michael Amador of Florida International University and R. Edward 
Geiselman of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
By analyzing interviews with robbery victims and witnesses, they found that 
seven detectives trained in the technique elicited 47% more information than 
before training, and 63% more than did nine untrained detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The technique involves asking fewer questions than in a standard interview, 
putting more burden on the witness to actively generate information rather than 
simply respond to queries, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Among its strategies is discerning the witness' job or hobby interests, which 
might indicate details he is more likely to recall. A clothing designer might 
be able to describe in detail what a suspect was wearing, for example. 
</P>
<P>
The witness is also asked to recall his emotions and thoughts at the time of 
the crime, because studies suggest that will help recollection. That can be 
tricky in the case of a victim who was frightened by the crime, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The interviewer also asks the witness what happened, not so much to get 
information as to determine the witness' vantage point in seeing the crime and 
the "mental pictures" he has of it. The meat of the interview lies in asking 
the witness to recall the event, one mental picture at a time, and probe each 
picture for detail as it unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a suspect initially approached the witness and then walked 
away, the witness should be asked about the suspect's face only while recalling 
the approach. Questions about the back of the suspect's jacket should wait 
until the witness has moved on to recalling the departure. 
</P>
<P>
The technique has "a lot of promise," said Gary Wells, chairman of the 
psychology department at Iowa State University and the author of a handbook on 
eyewitness identification for police. 
</P>
<P>
But he and Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington have some 
reservations. For example, the interview combines several techniques, and it is 
not clear which produces the results. Finding that out might help researchers 
determine when to use the interview and when not to, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Loftus also questioned whether the extra details recalled during the cognitive 
interview are important. "Some of them are important, some of them are not," 
Fisher said. "I go for all the information I can get." 
</P>
<P>
Wells said more tests of the technique are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Another line of memory research deals with the risk that a victim or witness 
will falsely identify an innocent person. Several hundred people a year may be 
falsely convicted of felonies in the United States through erroneous 
identification, said Ken Deffenbacher, a psychology professor at the University 
of Nebraska at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory experiments have shown two strategies useful in reducing the risk of 
false identifications in police lineups, Wells said. Lineups include a person 
suspected by police and several people who generally resemble him. 
</P>
<P>
In one strategy Wells studied, the witness is shown a "blank" lineup which, 
unknown to him, does not contain any suspects. If he fingers somebody, he is 
discarded as unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
In the other strategy, the witness is shown one person at a time and asked if 
it is the right person. In the laboratory, this technique reduced the incidence 
of false identifications by 20% to nearly 40%, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Ron Lewis of the robbery-homicide division of the Los Angeles Police 
Department said he considers the "blank" lineup unnecessary because a regular 
lineup can already expose an erroneous witness if the witness fails to choose 
the suspect. He also said the district attorney generally will not file a 
complaint against a person identified by only one witness; corroborating 
evidence or multiple witness identifications are generally needed. 
</P>
<P>
On another aspect of eyewitness reliability, studies show that people do more 
poorly in identifying people of a different race than of their own, said 
psychologist John Brigham of Florida State University. His recent analysis of 
14 studies involving blacks and whites found the problem affected each race 
about equally. "A lot of people had assumed that whites would do worse with 
blacks than blacks would do with whites," Brigham said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the problem is not clear. The observer's degree of racial 
prejudice does not seem to make a consistent difference, and evidence 
suggesting that the cause is lack of exposure to people of a different race is 
"pretty weak," he said. Perhaps scientists need a better measure of exposure, 
including types of exposure, to demonstrate such a relationship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brigham suggested that in appropriate cases, jurors be told of the hazards of 
cross-racial identification. He also recommended that lineups be arranged by an 
officer who is the same race as the suspect and may be better able to choose 
people who resemble the suspect, providing a fairer test of the identification. 
Police departments do not appear to do that generally now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Assn. of Chiefs of Police, 
said he doubts that such a practice would be widely used because of the 
logistics of having enough officers of the proper race available. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said that when he describes his lineup techniques and the cognitive 
interview while giving workshops to police, "they are quite impressed with the 
kinds of findings that we're coming up with. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think this is one of the areas of applied psychology that is making a 
real contribution and a real difference."

IN SOUTHERN FRANCE, EXILED DUVALIER IS JUST PART OF THE POSH LANDSCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE EX-HAITIAN DESPOT WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY ONLY A WEEK. NOW, 'HE 
BOTHERS NO ONE; NO ONE BOTHERS HIM.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight-day visa given deposed Haitian dictator Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) 
Duvalier expired nearly four years ago, but here in the South of France, he's 
just part of the luxurious landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes where he wants, does what he wants, like any citizen of France," said 
Christian Tac, the local police commander. "He bothers no one; no one bothers 
him. And we don't watch him." 
</P>
<P>
Duvalier ended up here Feb. 7, 1986, after he was bundled into an American 
plane to be taken anywhere but the United States. After some arm-twisting, the 
French government said he could stay -- for one week. 
</P>
<P>
The government's unofficial position is that authorities hope no one notices 
that he is still here. The case falls into a zone known loosely in France as 
"artistic vagueness." 
</P>
<P>
Several government spokesmen, speaking anonymously in line with government 
policy, addressed the question. 
</P>
<P>
President Francois Mitterrand's office in Paris explained: "We wanted to 
encourage civil peace in Haiti. We might admit someone we do not want to help a 
democratic process. As to why he is still here four years later, you'd best ask 
the Quai d'Orsay." 
</P>
<P>
At the Quai, the Foreign Ministry, a spokesman checked and reported: "He is 
still 'assigned to residence,' more or less. To my knowledge, he does not have 
political refugee status." 
</P>
<P>
When advised that police said restrictions on Duvalier's movements were 
gradually dropped in mid-1988, he replied, "Ah." He suggested checking with the 
ministries of justice and interior. 
</P>
<P>
Neither ministry offered more precision. 
</P>
<P>
Duvalier is disputing in French courts Haiti's case to recover $120 million he 
is alleged to have taken with him into exile, but Haitian authorities have 
relaxed their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Duvalier?" repeated Nicole Brunet, public relations officer of Mougins, a 
Riviera village that rates only discretion above its three-star restaurants. "I 
don't even know where he lives." 
</P>
<P>
He lives behind a gate of black iron spears in Villa Mohamedia, rented from the 
Saudi magnate Adnan Kashoggi. When a reporter paused out front, two burly 
guards with assault rifles sprinted forward. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter handed a card through the gate, just beyond reach of three 
snarling, snapping guard dogs. Moments later, he was told what most visitors 
hear: "They are receiving no one." 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former president-for-life and his wife, Michelle, live with 
their two children. Nicolas, 8, goes to a private school. Anya, 4, plays at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Tac, the police commander, said he rarely consults his fat blue file on the 
family, and he sees them only occasionally. They are comfortably settled and 
anxious to avoid the limelight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duvalier turned in his beloved red Ferrari for a BMW to lower his profile. His 
wife has dropped the ambition she once confided to Vanity Fair magazine -- to 
be a Los Angeles fashion model. 
</P>
<P>
"Their very name is discretion," Tac said. "If only everyone could be so 
peaceable." 
</P>
<P>
The Duvaliers have no apparent financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They never come up here, but sometimes their bodyguards will clear out 
boutiques in Cannes so Madame Duvalier can shop in tranquility," said 
Jean-Louis Truchi, a Mougins restaurateur. 
</P>
<P>
Their favorite bistro is Roger Verge's Moulin de Mougins, where no one blinks 
when dinner for two climbs into the hundreds of dollars. Monte Carlo's casinos 
are just down the road. 
</P>
<P>
They travel often to Paris, where Michelle's family lives, and they have three 
apartments and a nearby 18th-Century chateau. 
</P>
<P>
Yann Colin, a lawyer representing Haiti, filed liens on the real estate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not found all his liquid assets," Colin said. "He was not dumb enough 
to bring it all here." 
</P>
<P>
The Duvaliers' arrival caused some embarrassment after the euphoric revolution 
that ended the 30-year Duvalier dynasty. France values its tradition as a land 
of asylum but also seeks to keep at arm's length rulers deposed by popular 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, a physician turned despot, ruled Haiti from 1957 
until his death in 1971, keeping order with a hated goon squad, the Tontons 
Macoutes. Son Jean-Claude, designated to take over his job, relaxed some 
repression. But he relied on the same secret police to enforce his absolute 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Mohamedia is the Duvalier's third home in France. After a stay at a posh 
hotel in Talloires, in the foothills of the French Alps, they were banished to 
the Riviera. After staying in Grasse, the world's perfume capital, they moved 
up the road to Mougins. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they were ordered to remain in the immediate vicinity of the Cote 
d'Azur and Monte Carlo. Then they were quietly allowed total freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The villa's lush grounds are within earshot of the broad freeway along the 
Mediterranean shore, linking Nice to parts north. It lies between a lettuce 
patch and some nondescript homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I never see the guy, and I don't know what he's up to," remarked a neighbor 
who declined to be identified. "He's no pal of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Mougins is among the loveliest villages of France, a pleasant tangle of old 
stone buildings and semitropical vegetation tumbling down a steep hill within 
sight of the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
It is known abroad as that place with all the good restaurants. In France, many 
people regard it as having the highest per capita net worth in a wealthy 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Brunet, the public relations officer, shrugs off the net-worth question, 
combining discretion with a protestation that such details are not on record. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is true that there is very little construction here, which tends to 
drive up the costs of things," she said. "After all, the mayor does not want 
just anyone."

AFRICA: JOHN PAUL II ADVISES THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT TO AVOID CORRUPTION 
AND ABUSE OF POWER AS IT MOVES TOWARD A MORE OPEN SOCIETY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Preaching brotherhood in the dusty capital of one of the world's poorest 
nations, Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged a revolutionary government to move 
firmly away from its Marxist roots. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope told leaders of this West African country of 1 million to shun 
corruption and the abuse of power as they continue on a path to a more open 
society after a decade of Marxist failure. 
</P>
<P>
A former Portuguese colony that won independence in 1974 after a sapping 
guerrilla war, Guinea-Bissau, the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut 
combined, is the poorest of the five countries on John Paul's tour of 
sub-Saharan Africa. Once firmly Marxist, Guinea-Bissau has moved in the past 
few years away from Soviet and Cuban sponsors toward a market economy and 
greater friendship with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cheering Roman Catholics, a 7% minority nationwide, gathered along the roadside 
as the papal motorcade swept past banana trees and tin-roofed shacks to the 
ramshackle capital of a country where 80% of the people are illiterate and the 
average yearly income is less than $200. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of all children die before age 5 in a green and swampy land of 
subsistence agriculture, mostly rice, where life expectancy is just 40 years, 
according to figures of the World Bank. It lists Guinea-Bissau as one of the 
world's 15 poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving from a rainy two days in the normally drought-stricken island nation 
of Cape Verde, the Pope appealed in his homily at a soccer stadium Mass for 
full respect for human rights in a one-party state. 
</P>
<P>
Such respect, he said, must be a fundamental ingredient in "a common aspiration 
for authentic solidarity and social and economic cooperation as the fruit of 
overcoming static and conditioned ideology." 
</P>
<P>
In an arrival address to President Joao Bernardo Vieira and members of his 
government, the Pope called for a broadly based national education system shorn 
of ideological bias. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray that educative programs enjoy full success, beginning with genuine 
literacy," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican officials traveling with the pontiff said that his reference was to the 
strong, lingering Marxist content of the national syllabus and a continuing 
resentment against public education. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul asserted that individuals must be masters of their own destiny. They 
must resist "all that would seek to crush the individual or cancel him in an 
anonymous collectivity by institutions, structures, or a system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church, as a colonial symbol, was one of the principal 
enemies in the revolt by Vieira and others against Portugal in the 1970s. Their 
struggle was strongly supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The church had little influence in the independent Marxist state that was 
formed when a beaten Portugal withdrew. After a decade of economic failure, 
though, Guinea-Bissau today welcomes both Western aid and foreign investment in 
a belated quest for modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Catholic Church is respectable again and so is the United States, whose 
modest $4-million aid program, which funds small Peace Corps contingents, is 
still dwarfed by a massive Soviet presence. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, to mark World Leprosy Day, John Paul will visit a modern 
leprosarium on the outskirts of the capital. Run by Franciscan priests and 
funded by the Italian government, the center has become a continental model for 
an Africa where leprosy is only one of innumerable uncontrolled afflictions. 
</P>
<P>
Later today, the papal cavalcade flies to landlocked, French-speaking Mali, the 
third stop on an eight-day African odyssey that is John Paul's 45th foreign 
trip. After further stops in Burkina Faso and Chad, the Pope returns to the 
Vatican next Thursday.

KASHMIR MILITANTS BURN INDIA FLAGS DURING BREAK IN CURFEW

<P>
Muslim militants fighting for an independent nation burned Indian flags on the 
streets Saturday during a two-hour break in a week-old curfew in the Kashmir 
Valley, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers and paramilitary policemen patrolled Srinagar and 
adjoining towns. 
</P>
<P>
At least 72 people, mostly curfew violators, have been killed since Jan. 20, 
when troops and police officers fanned out in the northern valley to counter 
militants demanding secession of predominantly Muslim Kashmir from mostly Hindu 
India. 
</P>
<P>
The government repeated charges that neighboring Pakistan was fomenting the 
trouble and appealed to the United States and several other countries to ensure 
the situation does not get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has denied fueling the secessionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists were forbidden from going on the streets of Srinagar, the summer 
capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, and a district judge ordered the expulsion 
of five foreign correspondents, from Time, Newsweek, the Christian Science 
Monitor, United Press International and the French news agency Agence 
France-Presse. 
</P>
<P>
District Magistrate Ghulam Abbas said the presence of the reporters and 
photographers "was adjudged prejudicial to the security of the state." 
</P>
<P>
There were no sounds of gunfire in the city Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities relaxed the curfew in Srinagar for two hours Saturday, but few 
people went outside because it was raining. Residents were not informed of the 
break until a radio announcement about 45 minutes before the break was 
scheduled to end. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of young Muslim men gathered at two places in the city and burned Indian 
flags, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The last break in the round-the-clock curfew was Thursday. The curfew was 
abruptly imposed again after police said Muslim militants killed four air force 
officers on the outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmir has been a disputed area since 1947, when India and Pakistan gained 
independence after the partition of British-ruled India. Some of the militants 
want Kashmir to unify with Pakistan.

<P>
Ion Mihai Pacepa remembers July 23, 1978, well. Then the acting chief of the 
Romanian espionage service, he stayed up all night that Saturday talking with 
his 24-year-old daughter, Dana, about her plans for the future. It was a warm 
evening, and the magnolias in their Bucharest garden were in bloom. Their 
conversation was a good one. His daughter had just finished her education, had 
a good job, and was engaged to marry a man who truly loved her. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning Dana -- dressed in the blue jeans and khaki shirt her father 
has held in his memory all the years since -- drove Pacepa to the airport, 
where he boarded a plane for West Germany. His mission was to deliver a message 
from President Nicolae Ceausescu to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. He did deliver 
the message, but his real purpose was a different one. Five days later Pacepa 
was granted political asylum by the United States, the highest ranking official 
from the Soviet Bloc to do so. He had told no one of his plans to defect. 
</P>
<P>
The only way he could alert his daughter was to phone her the night before he 
left on July 28 on a hurriedly arranged U.S. troop transport plane to tell her 
he would be late. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt terrible," Pacepa recalled recently in an interview in a Washington 
hotel. "But I couldn't tell her a word. It would have put her in terrible 
danger. They would have killed her. All I could say was 'I'll be late.' 'How 
late, Daddy,' she asked. 'I don't know,' was all I could say." 
</P>
<P>
It would not be until early January, when she arrived with her husband Radu 
(her former fiance) and family at Dulles International Airport, that Pacepa, 
61, would see his daughter again. She and her family plan to make a new life 
for themselves in this country. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be until after Ceausescu's execution on Dec. 25 that Pacepa was 
even able to speak with her. Since her father's defection, she had lived under 
a kind of house arrest. Then during the turmoil in Romania last month, Dana 
Pacepa and her family were taken from their home by members of the Romanian 
Securitate, who threatened to execute them. 
</P>
<P>
Pacepa heard about his daughter's capture when he was awakened in the middle of 
the night on Dec. 23 by a call from a State Department official. "They said, 
"We have very bad news. We are so sorry,' " Pacepa recalled. "They were very, 
very nice." 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, Pacepa got another phone call, this time from Virginia 
Young, an official at the American Embassy in Bucharest, who reported that Dana 
Pacepa had turned up at the American Embassy. She and her family had escaped 
when, as they were being driven to the execution site, news came over the car 
radio that Ceausescu had been captured. Their guards fled; the family hid out 
for a few days and then Dana Pacepa made her way to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Young arranged a call between father and daughter ("Ginny said, "Here she is. 
Talk to her,' and believe me I did," Pacepa said teary-eyed). During the call, 
Young interrupted to tell Pacepa that the new government had approved the 
family's passports. (The exit visas were already waiting at the embassy.) 
</P>
<P>
He had managed to keep track of her over the years only with the help of the 
State Department. "Her apartment was across the street from the American 
library," Pacepa explained, "and at least they were able to see her." When 
Pacepa, now called Mike -- an Americanization of his middle name -- left 
Romania in 1978, he left everything behind: his two jobs as one of Ceausescu's 
four senior advisers and as acting chief of the foreign intelligence service 
(the D.I.E. or Departmentual de Informatii Externe), his 6,000-square-foot 
ground-floor apartment with a large outdoor swimming pool, a sauna, a 
greenhouse, a basement studio for his artist daughter, his painting collection 
(including a Courbet), his four cars (a Mercedes, an Alfa-Romeo and two 
Romanian models), his two drivers and his lifetime career in the Romanian 
secret service. 
</P>
<P>
He also left behind a bugged apartment (he estimates that there were 10 million 
microphones or bugged telephones in a country of 22 million people) and his 
virtual daily contact with Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, both of whom he said 
he had come to despise. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ceausescu) remained in power because he knew how to lie," Pacepa said. "He 
was preoccupied with subduing his audience. His idol was Hitler. He studied his 
speeches, particularly the speech at the 1936 Olympic Games." 
</P>
<P>
What Pacepa took with him, however, was his photographic memory, a talent 
encouraged by his father, who made his young son memorize a page of the 
telephone book every day in the hope that Pacepa would become a chemical 
engineer, which he did in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Pacepa could memorize not only whole pages but also faces. It was knowledge of 
that genius that led Ceausescu to dismantle the foreign espionage apparatus 
after Pacepa's defection. Because Pacepa personally signed each photo 
identification card of the members of Romania's foreign intelligence service, 
he was able to identify them; he estimates that within three years of his 
departure, 95% of that staff lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Pacepa's responsibilities, which are written about in some detail in his 1987 
book "Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief" (published by Regnery 
Gateway in Washington), ranged from the mundane (on every foreign presidential 
trip, Pacepa was responsible for making sure that air-conditioning was turned 
off if possible whenever Ceausescu was around; the former dictator, according 
to Pacepa, feared assassination by radiation that might come from 
air-conditioning) to the monumental (Pacepa was responsible for stealing 
Western technology for use in Romania). 
</P>
<P>
Once in the United States, he learned American ways and acquired a new life as 
the engineer he had trained to be -- although he is unwilling to talk about 
that life, or reveal where it is. He is also unwilling to be photographed or 
discuss the friends he has made, although he is generous with praise for the 
many people who have helped him throughout his ordeal, particularly Rep. Frank 
R. Wolf (R-Va.); Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger; Paula 
Dobrianski, assistant undersecretary of state for human rights, and William 
Geimer, the chairman of the Jamestown Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Pacepa is acutely aware that his daughter has had a very different experience. 
Immediately after her father's defection, for example, the family apartment was 
seized by the Romanian government. She was allowed to keep her own clothes, her 
own things, but all of her father's possessions -- with the exception of one 
table and two chairs -- were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to America, she and her husband were able to leave the house only 
for personal reasons or for their jobs as artists working on animated films -- 
and four or five Securitate guards were with them. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Pacepa plans to stay in Washington with his daughter, her 
husband and their family. As for the future, he thinks he will continue to live 
his new life under his new name -- it is a wonderful life, he said, and proof 
that an entirely new one can be started at 50. 
</P>
<P>
He also will be around to help his daughter, who is 36, and son-in-law, who 
want to make a name for themselves as artists. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left, I thought it was the end," he recalled. "But it was really the 
beginning. And if I, who was already 50 when I left, could make a new life, 
they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
But there was one thing Pacepa was convinced would help his daughter and 
son-in-law in this new life. He took them shopping to buy each of them what 
would have cost a month and a half's salary in Bucharest -- a new pair of 
jeans.

4 TOP CEAUSESCU AIDES ADMIT COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE;

<P>

<P>
Four top aides of former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu have confessed 
they are guilty of complicity to commit genocide, a lawyer told a military 
court Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Prime Minister Ion Dinca, former Interior Minister Tudor 
Postelnicu, Communist Party organizational chief Emil Bobu and former Vice 
President Manea Manescu are the first senior Ceausescu regime officials to go 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer who read out the charges to the court said the four had confessed to 
all charges, but they did not formally enter a plea in court. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was adjourned after a three-hour opening session. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Dinca told the court that he was a coward not to have 
opposed Ceausescu's orders to shoot protesters in the Transylvanian city of 
Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
The killings in Timisoara sparked the revolution that toppled Ceausescu on Dec. 
22. He and his powerful wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge said it had been confirmed that 689 people were killed and 
1,200 wounded in last month's uprising against Ceausescu, figures far lower 
than initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Dinca, 61, responded confidently and promptly to the questions of the five 
uniformed military judges. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by a defense lawyer, he said: "If I did not agree (with Ceausescu's 
orders) I would not have lasted for a single minute." 
</P>
<P>
He said that shortly before Ceausescu fled Bucharest in a helicopter as 
protesters cried for his blood, the dictator called a last meeting of the 
ruling Politburo to discuss how to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked each of us if we would fight for the revolution, and we each said 
yes," Dinca told the trial, which is being televised live. 
</P>
<P>
Dinca said Ceausescu had called for Postelnicu to be shot for not putting down 
the protests in Timisoara with enough force. 
</P>
<P>
After being questioned, Dinca signed a document saying the court record of his 
remarks was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Bucharest, Romania's embattled provisional government held crisis 
talks with three main opposition parties in the face of mounting public 
discontent, party sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Salvation Front demanded the meeting hours after Vice 
President Dumitru Mazilu resigned, accusing the front of using Stalinist 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
"An aide of President Ion Iliescu called during the night to invite us," one 
opposition party source said, adding that no reason was given. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the National Peasants Party, the National Liberal Party and the 
Social Democratic Party attended the talks in the Popular Front's heavily 
guarded headquarters in the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The three old parties, banned at the start of Communist rule in 1947, accuse 
the leaders of the five-week-old Popular Front of being closet Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The parties formed a loose opposition coalition this week after the Popular 
Front sparked street protests when it said in an abrupt about-face that it 
would run candidates in elections set for May 20. 
</P>
<P>
When the Popular Front took power after Ceausescu was toppled, leaders pledged 
to disband the movement after guiding Romania to democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties want elections to be postponed and a broad-based transition 
government, including Popular Front supporters, to be formed. 
</P>
<P>
"May 20 is too soon for elections. We need more time to organize and are 
seeking a postponement until August or September," Peasants Party spokesman 
Valentin Gabrielescu said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to have a neutral government immediately. This is a Communist 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three parties have called for a mass anti-Popular Front demonstration today 
outside the Foreign Ministry.

5 ETHNIC ALBANIANS KILLED BY POLICE IN YUGOSLAV RIOTS

<P>
At least five ethnic Albanians were killed and an undetermined number were 
wounded in gun battles with police Saturday, the fifth day of riots in 
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, the news agency Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said four people were killed in Orahovac and one in Pec, where up to 
2,000 people demonstrated to call for the resignation of local leaders, free 
elections and the release of political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
A separate demonstration in the country's second-biggest city, Zagreb, drew 
over 10,000 students to the streets to protest soaring inflation and falling 
living standards, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said of the Kosovo clashes in Pec and Orahovac, "We have learned that 
five people died." It said demonstrations also took place in towns of Suva 
Reka, Dusanovac and Gnjilane. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Pristina said many people, including policemen, were injured in the 
clashes and least five were taken to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said police returned fire after demonstrators shot at them from several 
directions. It said the Orahovac clash was the worst in five days of rioting. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of violence was the worst in the southern province since 28 people 
were killed last March when ethnic Albanians rioted against curbs on the 
province's self-rule in favor of Serbia, Yugoslavia's biggest republic. 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, an autonomous province of Serbia, is a focal point of friction between 
the area's 1.7 million mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians and 200,000 Christian 
Serbs and Montenegrins. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia imposed constitutional curbs on Kosovo's self-rule last March, saying 
Albanian separatists wanted to annex the province to neighboring Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, human rights and opposition groups in Kosovo called for 
political solutions instead of violence, saying street protests are detrimental 
to democratic processes. 
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement the protests could be used as a pretext "for 
reinforcing and prolonging emergency measures" clamped on Kosovo last year. 
</P>
<P>
The groups also demanded a date for free elections, an end to Communist media 
control and political discrimination, the freeing of political prisoners and 
the right to form political associations.

Reinforced concrete slabs from the Berlin Wall should be used for building 
silos and manure storage containers, an East German political party said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Prized wall graffiti would not have to vanish if the concrete were put to such 
use, the Democratic Peasants Party's official newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Valuable paintings would certainly face outward and would thus be maintained 
for future generations," the paper said. "Why shouldn't villages also have such 
a tourist attraction?" 
</P>
<P>
Since Communist authorities opened the wall Nov. 9 after 28 years, East German 
officials have said the border barrier will be dismantled and sold by the slab 
to foreigners paying hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
East German border guards removed a first 320-yard stretch of the 100-mile wall 
in West Berlin last week and carted the pieces off to a depot.

RECORD 2,700-ACRE ESTATE SEIZED IN DRUG CASE

The wooded 2,700-acre riverfront estate of a convicted cocaine smuggler was 
seized by federal marshals Saturday in the largest land forfeiture action ever 
against a U.S. drug figure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
James West said investigators believe Frederik Luytjes had intended to return 
to the $2.8-million Mastwood estate in the Pocono Mountain region after he 
completes his 10-year prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
A forfeiture complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Scranton alleged that 
Luytjes had purchased the property with cocaine profits, making it subject to 
seizure under federal drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
Luytjes, 47, allegedly used his charter aircraft business, Air America Inc., to 
provide planes and recruit pilots for a smuggling operation that imported 10 
tons of Medellin cartel-supplied cocaine into the United States from Colombia 
between 1980 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
West said Mastwood represented the largest tract of land ever seized in the 
United States in a drug-related forfeiture action. The government previously 
seized about $18 million in cash and other assets from Luytjes and his 
associates.

VINA DELMAR; ADAPTED 'THE AWFUL TRUTH' FOR THE SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vina Delmar, who as a young woman wrote a series of novels that scandalized the 
country, making them not only best-sellers but giving her entree to Hollywood, 
has died in a Pasadena convalescent hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "Bad Girl," a 1928 Literary Guild selection about premarital sex 
and pregnancy that later became a play and film, was 86 at her death Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The widow of Eugene Delmar, a writer who became her editor, lived much of her 
life in Beverly Hills where she later wrote historical novels. 
</P>
<P>
Her screen adaptation of "The Awful Truth," a play by Arthur Richman, was 
nominated for an Academy Award. The now cult classic comedy starred Cary Grant 
and Irene Dunne as a couple going through divorce and an ultimate 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Delmar's other works included "Kept Woman," a collection of short stories 
called "Loose Ladies" and her historical works -- "Beloved," "The Big Family," 
"A Time for Titans" and a domestic novel, "The Marcaboth Women," a Literary 
Guild selection in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Her other work in films included "About Mrs. Leslie," "Make Way for Tomorrow" 
and "Cynthia," an early Elizabeth Taylor movie. 
</P>
<P>
More recently she had written "The Becker Scandal: A Time Remembered" about a 
1912 New York City police scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include four grandchildren.

VOLUNTEERS PLUG HOMELESS HEALTH CARE GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harney Cordua, a retired San Diego doctor, has a simple reason for volunteering 
his services on Wednesdays at the Joan Kroc/St. Vincent de Paul health clinic 
that provides basic medical care to homeless men, women and children. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the people who are down and out," Cordua said. "People get into some 
weird situations. Sometimes they fall so far between the cracks that you can't 
see them." 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with an out-of-work and homeless truck driver who needed care 
for a badly damaged jaw. Government programs ensured that the trucker 
eventually would get care -- but busy medical specialists who provide care 
through county and state entitlement programs were unable to treat the man for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Cordua provided primary care for the trucker's wounds and turned the man over 
to a social worker who "knows how to kick shins and get action." Within 
minutes, the clinic had located a doctor who would voluntarily treat the man 
within a day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes this job really worthwhile," Cordua said. "We really pulled 
that one out of the hat." 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of San Diego-area doctors are heeding the call to treat the 
poor and sick for free. A recent San Diego County Medical Society position 
paper urged physicians to volunteer to help the homeless, in the face of 
worsening cutbacks of government-funded medical care programs. 
</P>
<P>
But to some retired doctors, this supposedly new trend simply marks a return to 
the days when giving services to the poor was a basic part of being a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
John Bishop, a retired San Diego pediatrician, volunteers at St. Vincent de 
Paul's clinic partly to keep his medical license current. The clinic's patients 
also give him an opportunity to practice his Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But Bishop also views the clinic as a good way to fulfill his obligation to 
provide community service. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started out (in medicine) everyone volunteered," Bishop said. 
"Everybody did their part to pick up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Another retired physician, Frank Ditraglia, blames well-meaning government 
programs for getting doctors out of the volunteer habit. 
</P>
<P>
"During the 1950s, we all volunteered," said Ditraglia, who volunteers at the 
St. Vincent's clinic. "The indigent, the homeless, they were all cared for by 
volunteer doctors. And, if you didn't do it, your colleagues shamed you into 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
"What killed (volunteerism) was the Great Society," Ditraglia said. "Suddenly 
there were bucks for Medi-Cal and Medicare. Doctors started getting paid for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
With health-care costs skyrocketing and government funding on the decline, 
doctors have "gone the full circle . . . we're back to having volunteers pick 
up the slack," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Older doctors and nurses who will volunteer their time -- or work at 
lower-than-market rates -- represent "an absolute gold mine" for counties 
struggling to provide adequate care for the medically indigent, said Paul 
Simms, deputy director of San Diego County's Physical Health Services 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state regulators seem unlikely to bolster indigent health care, 
Simms said, "so maybe we have to start going back to some more fundamental 
values . . . when people (occasionally) gave half a day to the county 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
But, although Simms and other health-care observers applauded volunteer 
efforts, they caution that voluntarism alone won't solve the indigent 
population's health-care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stopgap measure," said Stephen Shubert, executive director of the San 
Diego Council of Community Clinics, whose members provide primary medical care 
for many of San Diego County's underinsured and uninsured residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you can get a volunteer program that is very successful in one 
area," Shubert said. "But the problem is so massive that voluntarism alone 
really can't deal with it. It's simply not a universal solution. I'd never say 
anything bad about volunteer efforts, but I'd merely point out that it's not 
the final solution." 
</P>
<P>
Access to affordable health care is a growing problem in San Diego County, 
where an estimated 600,000 people are uninsured or underinsured. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of money is the most common reason that the homeless fail to seek medical 
care, according to a recent survey that San Diego-based consultants Brenda 
Hotchkiss and Shimon Camiel conducted for the San Diego Community Healthcare 
Alliance, a nonprofit group in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30% of homeless people interviewed during the survey cited money 
troubles as the primary reason for not seeking care. Inability to get to 
clinics was cited by 13% of the respondents. Just 20% of those interviewed said 
that finding medical care was not a problem, Camiel said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hospital Council of San Diego and Imperial Counties, after studying care 
options available to the indigent, gave San Diego County a "D" grade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are well on the way to failing to meet the access to medical care needs of 
San Diegans," said council President James Lott. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless can seek treatment by staff doctors at community clinics, but 
government-funded health-care programs don't always reimburse clinics that care 
for indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
"People still call us 'free clinics,' but I have to reiterate that we're not 
free," said M. Jean Serafy, director of the five state-licensed community 
clinics operated by Episcopal Community Services in San Diego. Serafy said her 
clinics turn away patients only if a doctor is not available to provide 
treatment, but "quality medical care costs money, and we can't do it cheaply." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless often go without primary care, however, because entitlement 
programs such as Medi-Cal and County Medical Services are designed for health 
problems that are life-threatening, potentially disabling or that cause severe 
pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
One program, the Healthcare for the Homeless project, does reimburse community 
clinics for basic health care given to the homeless. During the fiscal year 
ended Nov. 30, 1988, the program paid for 11,888 visits by 4,000 people. During 
the first six months of the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1989, the program 
covered 8,119 visits by 2,808 patients. 
</P>
<P>
The project, with the Logan Heights Family Health Center as the lead agency, 
has an annual budget of $1.3 million, including federal funds, private 
donations and in-kind services provided by participating clinics. 
</P>
<P>
But the Healthcare for the Homeless project, like voluntarism, is only a 
partial solution to the medical needs of the homeless, said Logan Heights 
center spokeswoman Karen McCabe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise that those who are really left out of the system -- the 
working and non-working poor who don't even have a house -- have the worst 
problems and the least potential for getting treatment," said Frank 
Landerville, project director of the Regional Task Force on the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless "are usually the toughest group . . . for health professionals to 
deal with," Landerville said. In addition to the needs for basic medical care, 
some of the homeless have untreated mental illnesses or physical problems 
linked to drug and alcohol abuse, Landerville said. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to basic health-care needs, homeless San Diegans suffer from the 
same ailments that dog San Diegans with medical insurance plans, said Dr. Lorin 
Holst, the medical director and only paid doctor at the St. Vincent de Paul 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
But the homeless usually are slower to seek medical care because they are more 
concerned with finding shelter and food, Holst said. As a result, simple, 
treatable illnesses are exacerbated by time and harsh living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Simple chest colds give way to pneumonia and bronchitis, rashes lead to severe 
infections, and muscular problems evolve into expensive and hard-to-treat 
conditions, Holst said. "They can end up losing a leg because they couldn't get 
a simple $40 treatment," Holst said. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Vincent de Paul clinic sets no eligibility requirements for its 
patients because, "when you are sick you need care immediately," Holst said. 
"Forms, bureaucracies, these are things that street people hate to deal with . 
. . they have a mistrust of all that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
And, homeless people who conceivably could qualify for entitlement programs too 
often have "simply stopped paying attention to their health needs," Landerville 
said. "It's something that happens in the process of becoming homeless." 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes by, (their health) gets worse, they find themselves on the street 
and, in many cases, it's been a long time since they've had adequate medical 
care," Landerville said. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the homeless man who sells homemade bamboo flutes on the 
street about a block from Landerville's downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been diagnosed as having AIDS, and he obviously doesn't have a lot of 
time left," Landerville said. With that diagnosis, a San Diegan with health 
insurance might seek treatment for AIDS, Landerville said, but the man has a 
more immediate need: finding the money for a room so he can "take a bath and 
alleviate the pain of his skin infections." 
</P>
<P>
Three downtown San Diego operations -- St. Vincent de Paul, Rachel's Women's 
Center and Life Ministries -- rely almost solely upon volunteer doctors and 
nurses to treat the primary health-care needs of the homeless. But, as is the 
case with many charitable operations, it can be difficult to find enough 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to make volunteering easier, the San Diego Community Healthcare Alliance 
last year awarded $45,000 grant to an organization that attempts to place 
volunteer professionals at clinics that treat the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of mailings to the county medical society's 2,900 members has generated 
about 50 volunteers, according to Mary Carpenter, placement director for 
"Option San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like anything else," Carpenter said. "People pick up a piece of paper the 
first time and typically set it aside." But Carpenter remains optimistic that 
more volunteers will be found. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the San Diego Gynecologic Society took the unusual step of 
asking its members to treat free at least one pregnant woman a month who would 
otherwise go without medical care because of a lack of funds or medical 
insurance. The new program was driven by the fact that San Diego County now has 
the state's highest rate of no-care deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Paul H. Coleman Jr., a Poway dentist, recently asked the county's 
1,600 dentists to provide a day's worth of free dental care to the indigent on 
Feb. 14, Valentine's Day. He was disappointed that just 30 offices agreed to 
take part in the project. 
</P>
<P>
While the first year's results "were not really impressive," Coleman said that 
participating offices will on Feb. 14 provide nearly $100,000 in free dental 
care. Coleman believes that media coverage of the daylong event will promote a 
stronger response when the program is repeated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel's Women's Center, a downtown day center for homeless women that is 
operated by Catholic Charities, has attracted enough volunteer medical 
professionals to conduct a regular medical screening program. But without 
volunteers, "we wouldn't do anything as far as medical services," said Catholic 
Charities Director Sister Raymonda. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Raymonda credited Dr. Carla Fox, a downtown internist, with recognizing 
the need for a screening program. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the only place downtown where women gathered in large numbers," 
Sister Raymonda said. Fox made the program a reality by finding more than a 
dozen doctors and nurses -- including dentists, an ophthalmologist and a 
podiatrist -- to provide volunteer services. 
</P>
<P>
St. Vincent de Paul's clinic, which relies totally upon volunteers, has 
compiled a list of about 50 medical professionals who regularly staff the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, the clinic treats about 600 homeless men, women and children, Holst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the St. Vincent's clinic spend most of their day treating chest 
colds, bronchitis and pneumonia, medical director Holst said. During the 
winter, when temperatures plunge and the rain falls, San Diego's street people 
are dogged by respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
The poor and homeless also are more likely to suffer muscular-skeletal problems 
-- including sprained ankles, bad backs, wrist and shoulder injuries. Foot 
diseases, rashes and skin infections also are more common among the homeless, 
as are sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Ivor Ankenbrandt, a Pacific Beach family practitioner, acknowledged 
that it is difficult to treat patients "when we hardly ever see the same 
patient twice." And, when patients live on the street, patient compliance -- a 
person's ability or willingness to follow a physician's directions -- suffers, 
Ankenbrandt said. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't always go home and get a good night's rest, because they don't have 
a home," Ankenbrandt said. And, "if they're not hurting, they're not going to 
come in" for follow-up treatment because they face more pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many of St. Vincent's doctors were recruited by Ditraglia, a retired New Jersey 
family practitioner who moved to San Diego during the early 1980s. Ditraglia, 
who first heard of the clinic during a Sunday sermon, has done "everything 
short of standing on the corner with a bullhorn" to attract volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
But his most successful tactic is to take potential volunteers on a 
"no-strings-attached tour" to see the facility and the needs of the people who 
go there for care. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to get them down here, and they'll ultimately volunteer."

SHERIFF'S RACE MAY HINGE ON WHO HOLDS KEY TO JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the new chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors recently 
threw his support behind a privately run correctional system to take the key to 
county jails away from the Sheriff's Department, he guaranteed one thing: 
</P>
<P>
No other issue is likely to carry greater importance in this year's election 
for sheriff, the first wide-open race in two decades for the county's top law 
enforcement job. 
</P>
<P>
The four major candidates seeking to succeed John Duffy are solidifying their 
campaign positions on the question of who should run the jails -- the sheriff 
or a civilian director appointed by the five-member Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate is insistent that the elected sheriff retain power over the 
county's detention system. Another is willing to let the board have the jails. 
Two others are proposing compromises in which the sheriff would be the top 
jailer but supervise a staff of correctional officers with limited peace 
officer status and lower salaries. 
</P>
<P>
And the local Deputy Sheriff's Assn., whose endorsement is seen as critical in 
this year's election, is arming itself against Supervisor Leon Williams and the 
rest of the board if they place the issue on this year's ballot and ask the 
public for an advisory opinion on who best belongs in the jailhouse control 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost 100% unified that a department of corrections is the wrong way to 
go," said Lt. Skip Murphy, deputy's association president. "We're talking to 
outside consultants about what we might have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we will not sit still if the Board of Supervisors decides to go 
through with it. We won't roll over on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
His group has the backing of the California State Sheriff's Assn., which helped 
the Santa Clara County deputy's association try to defeat a similar proposal. 
The deputy's group there spent $750,000 to challenge its Board of Supervisors, 
only to lose when a separate Department of Correction took control of the jails 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that starts out with a flurry and somebody does it, 
like Santa Clara County, and then everybody looks at it and says, 'Me too,' " 
said Al Cooper, legislative lobbyist for the state association. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's difficult for us to understand why five people elected to the Board 
of Supervisors would want the jails in the first place. It's got to be the 
biggest headache in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara County board members insist that they created their own corrections 
department for economic reasons, after becoming incensed with a series of 
million-dollar cost overruns posted by the sheriff. The new private agency will 
save $62 million in the first 10 years, county officials contend, mostly by 
reducing salaries and training schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Money is the bottom line in San Diego too. Although still awaiting a financial 
analysis on switching jail leadership, Supervisors Williams and George Bailey 
outlined their position in an advisory letter, spelling out the rising costs of 
housing inmates in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Faced with similar circumstances, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors 
initiated action to allow the board to take charge of their correctional 
facilities," they said. "Discussions with Santa Clara County officials in 
November revealed that this action has enabled the county to reduce costs of 
operation and improve administrative procedures and operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is now for San Diego County to determine whether or not we need to 
take similar action. Costs are accelerating to operate today's facilities and 
will sky rocket to pay for tomorrow's facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's current budget is $110.8 million, with $52.5 million allocated for 
operation and support services for the detention facilities. Three years ago, 
the sheriff's jail budget was $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s saw an explosion in the growth of inmate population. As of the middle 
of last week, the seven county jails were housing 4,269 inmates, along with an 
additional 750 inmates assigned to honor camps and work-furlough programs. 
</P>
<P>
The jails now operate at 180% of rated capacity. And, even with completion of 
the new East Mesa Detention Facility and honor camp next year, with more than a 
1,000 new beds, it is predicted that the jails will remain crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Under those conditions, said Mel Nichols, commander of the sheriff's detention 
facilities, it is all the more important to have highly trained deputy sheriffs 
staffing the jails. He said he personally believes the jails should remain 
under the aegis of sworn officers in the Sheriff's Department, regardless of 
who is elected to replace Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some very, very competent administrators in our jail environment," 
he said. But Jim Butler, a former military chaplain in Vista who is pushing for 
a deputy review board for the Sheriff's Department, said a civilian jail system 
would bring a greater level of professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
He faulted the current system because newly hired deputies are initially 
assigned to jail work and have a difficult time adjusting to patrol duty when 
they leave the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the jails come out of that assignment and feel like all the people, 
all the public, are like those criminals," he said. "But police have to be 
people-oriented on the street, not criminal-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have their own views, and Ray Hoobler, a former San Diego police 
chief, agrees with Butler that the sheriff should relinquish the jails. "I 
never foresee sufficient funds within this county to provide adequate custodial 
facilities," he said. "So one positive aspect (for the sheriff) would be turn 
it over to a department of corrections." 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Jack Drown, one of Duffy's assistant sheriffs, supports his 
boss's unwavering position that the Sheriff's Department is the best agency to 
manage the jails. "You don't have to create a whole new bureaucracy and a whole 
new administration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Jimno, who is on leave from his post as Escondido police chief, said he 
would support a compromise measure in which correctional officers would be 
gradually hired to replace jail deputies. As the staff grew, the correctional 
officers would be promoted to front-line supervisors, but the Sheriff's 
Department always would have ultimate authority in the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's cost-effective," he said. "I think it's good business. There's no 
reason to have a cop be a jailer. That's not why you send a guy to a police 
training academy." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Roache, captain of the sheriff's Lemon Grove station, said he has a similar 
plan for staffing the jails, and he would build a career-ladder system to keep 
qualified correctional officers working the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it needs to be done no matter if a department of corrections is 
discussed or not," Roache said. "It makes good logical sense."

SAN MARCOS GOES TO TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
SMALL COMMUNITY LAYS BIG PLANS BASED ON NEW UNIVERSITY AND CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN MARCOS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask the mayor of San Marcos where his burgeoning young town is headed, and he 
talks about getting his hands on a used monorail from Disneyland to link a new 
City Hall, now on the drawing board, and a new state university, also on the 
drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos, perhaps best known historically for its dairy farm, chicken ranch, 
rock quarry and wholesale nurseries, is quickly and clearly maturing. The town 
is like some skinny little country boy sprouting in his adolescence with signs 
of sophistication and brawn and a vision of what he's going to be when he grows 
up and moves off the farm. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a city waiting to happen," Mayor Lee Thibadeau says, "and now, 
we're finally happening." 
</P>
<P>
If Thibadeau sounds like a rah-rah civic cheerleader, little wonder -- given 
where the city's been and where it's going. 
</P>
<P>
When San Marcos incorporated in 1963, the first City Hall was upstairs from the 
mayor's barber shop -- plenty large enough during the first year of municipal 
autonomy to house the one and only city employee. The second -- and current -- 
City Hall is a modular building that previously was used as an Escondido bank 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Even today there is no downtown, no shopping mall and no movie theater -- and, 
some say, no clear civic identity. The community center is known, simply and 
appropriately, as The Barn, and that kind of says it all. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgepodge development during the 1970s saw generally small and unspectacular 
housing tracts and apartment developments, strip commercial development and 
mom-and-pop manufacturing and industrial businesses housed in metal-sided 
buildings alongside California 78, which runs through the middle of town like 
an unwanted varicose vein. 
</P>
<P>
But as other communities filled up, the outside world discovered San Marcos. 
Today it explodes with growth and development that gets Chamber of Commerce 
officials and real estate agents giddy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, San Marcos was the fastest-growing city in San Diego County during the 
1980s, nearly doubling in population from 17,479 residents in 1980 to 33,835 
last January. That 93.6% population increase led North County's tumultuous 
growth in the '80s, which saw Carlsbad grow by 74.8%, Vista by 72.3% and 
Escondido by 53.8%. 
</P>
<P>
And San Marcos is just now finding its stride. 
</P>
<P>
* It is still only one-third developed, given a general plan that calls for an 
ultimate population of 110,000 residents. Just last year, the town's first 
master-planned residential community opened, and today there are plans at City 
Hall for thousands of new homes to be built during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a civic center, with a City Hall, county library and 
community center, is scheduled to begin next summer on a 59-acre parcel at Twin 
Oaks Valley Road and San Marcos Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction is to begin in the spring for the Cal State San Marcos campus, 
the first new state university to be built in 25 years. Ultimately, the campus 
is expected to attract as many students as San Diego State University, which, 
with 35,500 students, is the system's largest and which spawned the San Marcos 
campus because of its own successful North County satellite center. 
</P>
<P>
* Having successfully developed a 60-acre retail warehouse center anchored by 
the Price Club, Home Club and Levitz Furniture -- a retail complex so rich with 
sales-tax revenue that it pays 15% of the city's operating costs -- the city 
now says it is ready for the ultimate stamp of successful suburbanhood: a 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
* The city already has spent more than $50 million in redevelopment funds 
during the last five years on a variety of public works improvements -- and 
plans to spend another $323 million during the next five years, mostly to 
improve streets and flood control in addition to paying for the new civic 
center. 
</P>
<P>
* City Hall staff members are working with local businesses in setting up 
employer-sponsored day-care centers and in encouraging employers to implement 
staggered working hours to reduce peak-time traffic congestion in town. At the 
same time, the city has paid for the installation of computer terminals in the 
deputy sheriff's cars that patrol the city to reduce the amount of in-station 
paper work, and joined the city of Vista in paying for a Sheriff's Department 
street-level narcotics enforcement team to target drug traffickers working the 
two cities. 
</P>
<P>
* The city has endorsed the construction of a privately operated trash-burning 
power plant adjacent to a county garbage dump on the city's rural south side, 
arguing that the controversial project is environmentally and logistically more 
feasible than continued reliance on landfills. 
</P>
<P>
All this, in a community that grew by snores and yawns during its first 115 
years of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The first settler, Army Maj. Gustavus Merriam, came in 1875. He was a Civil War 
veteran who left his general store in Kansas in favor of this area's drier 
climate for the sake of his wife's tuberculosis. Merriam settled in the 
northern reaches of the Twin Oaks Valley, where he planted a sprawling 
vineyard, grazed cattle and raised bees. 
</P>
<P>
German immigrants who had settled in Olivenhain, to the south of San Marcos, 
worked for Merriam and many moved into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, with expectations of the railroad coming through the small settlement 
out of Oceanside, a general store, a blacksmith and a hotel opened as the 
town's first commercial cluster. The train took a slightly different route, 
however, and the would-be downtown found itself sidestepped by several blocks. 
New businesses opened along the railroad and from that time on, San Marcos 
never knew where its downtown was. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a land company mapped out the town for parcel sales, the place was 
slow taking off, mostly because the ground-water supply was poor and there was 
no imported water. By the mid-1950s, with the population only a couple 
thousand, two of the largest businesses in town were the Hollandia Dairy and 
the Prohoroff Poultry Farm, whose 2 million chickens made it one of the 
nation's largest egg suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, piped-in water from the Colorado River arrived in San Marcos, and the 
population jumped to nearly 10,000 -- a fivefold increase over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, while Escondido to the east and Vista to the west began annexing 
toward one another, San Marcos in the middle decided to incorporate out of 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Escondido had a shortage of industrial and commercial land and they thought 
the property along the railroad tracks in our direction would be an appropriate 
playground for them to latch onto," said Bill Bulow, a barber who was elected 
the city's first mayor when San Marcos incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
But the city had an abysmal tax base, and public works improvements were 
virtually non-existent as the city began to grow around existing, narrow 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, City Hall welcomed any and all development to help subsidize the 
cost of operating a city, and low-end housing developments, attracted by 
relatively cheap land, thrived. But the community soon backed itself into a 
corner: the growth outstripped the city's ability to handle sewage, and a 
building moratorium was ordered. When the moratorium was lifted in 1978, the 
country was in a recession. In 1983, when the economy improved, builders 
returned to San Marcos and the city, wanting to limit its growth, issued only a 
handful of new construction permits every three months. Builders literally 
camped in front of City Hall for the right to build even 10 or 15 houses or 
apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
That building-limitation plan backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger developers, who needed 100 or more units for their projects to 
pencil out so they could pay for parks and other amenities, couldn't get the 
permits they needed from us," City Manager Rick Gittings says. "They stopped 
dealing with us and went elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city played host to small-time developers building a few units 
here and there, but not contributing to the cost of widened streets, new parks 
or other community amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The building protocol in San Marcos was again amended: Today, a developer can 
build as many homes as local zoning laws permit -- as long as he pays for the 
streets, parks, schools and police and fire protection needed to serve the new 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The first builder to take the city up on its offer was the Baldwin Co., which 
is building 1,550 single-family homes near Palomar Community College. Project 
manager Cindy Shaffer estimates that each homeowner will pay between $1,700 and 
$2,000 a year in fees for up to 30 years to finance, among other things, a new 
community park, an elementary school, a fire station and the added cost of 
police protection required by the new residents. 
</P>
<P>
"San Marcos is supportive of development as long as it pays its fair share for 
the necessary public facilities," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Bill Snow, another developer who has worked in San Marcos: "It's easier to 
build in San Marcos than elsewhere. They're tough, but they're fair. You know 
what they want of you when you go in. When you're dealing with them, it's a 
level playing field with no funny bounces." 
</P>
<P>
The growth is bittersweet to longtime property owners, such as Arie DeJong, 
whose family began the Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos in 1952. DeJong figures 
the 1,000 cows now grazing alongside Mission Road will be relocated to the San 
Joaquin Valley within five years because maintaining 130 acres of grazing land 
in the middle of San Marcos is no longer financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
The family is making plans with the city to turn the property into a 
master-planned residential, commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'll make a big profit," DeJong says. "We'll do very well. But I'll 
hate to see the bulldozers come in and tear the place down for housing 
development. I'll end up living in a nice home surrounded by other homes, and 
I'm not used to that. I'm used to living in a nice home surrounded by dairy 
cows." 
</P>
<P>
The city's future focal point is not dairy cows but the new university, which 
will be erected at the site of the one-time chicken ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The property was first purchased by developer Stephen Bieri in 1985, when he 
and his partners acquired 556 acres of land along the southern reaches of Twin 
Oaks Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bieri's company planned a residential and commercial development there, but was 
persuaded by the city to sell 305 acres to the state for the campus after San 
Marcos beat out Carlsbad in spirited competition to host the 20th California 
State University campus. 
</P>
<P>
Bieri says he sold the land to the state at a loss, but figures to make up for 
it in the end while he develops the surrounding land with residential, 
commercial and business park uses. 
</P>
<P>
"San Marcos, with Palomar College and now the university, will be the 
educational hub of North County. In time, 40,000 to 50,000 students will be 
coming here," Bieri says. "That offers us some intriguing opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The next step, Bieri says, is in determining what sort of businesses to lure to 
his development. That will depend, he says, on the university's emerging 
character, and whether it becomes a high-tech engineering, computer science or 
bio-medical resource center, or a more traditional liberal arts and teaching 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Two hospitals -- Kaiser and Scripps Memorial -- are already considering 
building medical facilities in the university neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The university hasn't made up its mind what academic direction to take, but its 
president, Bill Stacy, says it's clear in either case that the emerging 
town-and-gown partnership between the city and the school will benefit both. 
</P>
<P>
"Typical town-and-gown relationships are cordial at best, but usually the town 
doesn't want the university to interfere as a major player in the community," 
Stacy says. "But we hear San Marcos saying, 'We want you to be the essence of 
our city.' That's a wonderful start." 
</P>
<P>
Stacy and others say that, hard-core academia aside, the university is sure to 
provide an element of culture now missing in San Marcos, whether in theater, 
opera, music or art. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mayor Thibadeau, "The university is giving us an opportunity to develop a 
major focal point, something we don't now have." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos will probably never have a downtown, Thibadeau says. Instead, 
officials talk of the "heart of the city," a long-range commercial, 
professional office and residential development plan that will be anchored, on 
the north, by the new City Hall and, on the south, by the new university 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
If Thibadeau has his way, the two will be linked by a monorail. The mayor wants 
to buy a piece of the existing Disneyland monorail system, which is being 
replaced by a newer one. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with a people mover?" he asks. "Heck, people pay to ride them at 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Is the idea a bit far-fetched? "Well, maybe that's an advantage of being a 
smaller town," he says. "We don't know any better."

500 MARCHERS PROTEST VERDICT IN MCMARTIN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred residents, some pushing strollers and carrying signs and bumper 
stickers declaring "We Believe the Children," marched through the streets of 
downtown Manhattan Beach Saturday evening to protest the not-guilty verdicts 10 
days ago in the McMartin Pre-School case. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they planned the "children's rights" protest soon after a 
Superior Court jury ended the 6-year-old case by clearing Ray Buckey and his 
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation charges. The jurors 
could not reach a verdict on 13 other charges. 
</P>

"The crime that occurred inside the courtroom was almost equal to the crime 
that occurred outside the courtroom," Tim Wheeler, the father of two former 
McMartin pupils, told about 500 cheering supporters at a rally after the 
mile-long march. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said parents have not lost faith in their children and continue to 
believe that they were abused at McMartin and other South Bay preschools closed 
in the face of child molestation allegations in the early 1980s. A major 
question during the lengthy McMartin case became the degree of reliability of 
evidence taken from children. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers began at the Manhattan Beach police station, where the child 
molestation allegations against Buckey, his mother and others at McMartin first 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Joggers and bicyclists on the Strand and patrons of the crowded cafes along 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard shouted encouragement to the marchers. The dozens of 
children in the group tied pink and yellow ribbons on fire hydrants, street 
signs and car door handles along the route. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the jury did what they thought was best," said protest spokeswoman 
Elizabeth Aleccia. "I think the judge did an excellent job too. I think the 
system itself is what failed. It made the children feel like they were to 
blame." 
</P>
<P>
Aleccia said her daughter, 14, was molested several years ago at another 
Manhattan Beach preschool that is now closed. The girl "felt physically ill" 
when she heard the verdicts, Aleccia said. 
</P>
<P>
Christine O'Rourke of Redondo Beach said that, even though she does not have 
children, she attended the march because she is tired of young people being 
mishandled by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the verdict I could hardly breathe," O'Rourke said. "This march 
is not aimed at putting this case behind us. We're ensuring that it doesn't 
happen again."

JAIL-CONTROL FIGHT LEAVES SCARS IN ANOTHER COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
DETENTION SYSTEM: AFTER A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE, SANTA CLARA COUNTY WRENCHED 
CONTROL OF ITS JAILS FROM THE SHERIFF. HOW IS IT WORKING? OPINIONS ARE VARIED.

<TEXT>
<P>
One year after seizing control of the jails from the sheriff, county political 
leaders here are convinced that their decision to establish a new Department of 
Correction was the right one to bring down high jail costs and institute new 
inmate rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
They believe they will save $62 million over 10 years for the taxpayers of 
Santa Clara County and that their concept of "direct supervision" of jail 
inmates and new drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs will help beat back a 
rising crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It is doing what I envisioned that it should be doing," Susanne Wilson, a 
veteran member of the County Board of Supervisors, said in a recent interview 
at City Hall, reflecting on her role in championing the board's fight to manage 
the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a responsible agency. It's more economical. And it's a safer and cheaper 
place for our prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, Santa Clara County became the only large county in California to 
switch from a jail system traditionally run by the Sheriff's Department to one 
managed, operated and controlled by civilian authorities. (Much smaller Madera 
and Napa counties already had switched to a jail system separate from the 
sheriff.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, that dramatic shift in power is under serious consideration by the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors, which has toured the new jail system here 
and discussed in detail the ramifications of stripping the jails from the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the key lessons learned from the long struggle in Santa Clara County 
is that such a power shift can leave a tremendous amount of ill feelings and a 
good measure of political blood on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Winter, sheriff in Santa Clara County for more than a decade, abruptly 
stepped down in August after his jails were cut out from underneath him. He now 
is weighing a campaign for a seat on the same Board of Supervisors that stole 
his thunder. 
</P>
<P>
Many rank-and-file deputy sheriffs, some of them forced to work in the new jail 
system until there are openings on sheriff's patrol assignments, fear that a 
major jailhouse riot or, worse yet, an officer's death lies in the near future. 
Many deputies openly criticize the new correctional officers as undertrained 
and note that last year criminal charges were filed against half a dozen of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"If something major happens, people are going to get hurt very, very badly," 
said Deputy Ronald Levine, who filed one of the many lawsuits over the jail 
issue and who now, in between his work shifts at the jail, is nurturing his own 
political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"That is simply because they are not that well-trained," he said of the 
correctional officers. "They don't have the skills. They don't have the 
training. And many of them are lazy." 
</P>
<P>
The local Deputy Sheriff's Assn. fought the change with three-quarters of a 
million dollars it had saved to buy a new headquarters building. The deputy's 
association leadership today is left frustrated and angry, and is investigating 
the backgrounds of the Board of Supervisors, looking for any embarrassing 
skeletons to exact some political revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Like Levine, the equally bitter Sgt. Tom Beck, a sworn deputy for 30 years and 
outgoing president of the deputy's association, said: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between getting angry and getting even. And, if I can 
prove certain things, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Just as San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy has sparred openly with the Board 
of Supervisors, Sheriff Winter of Santa Clara County never backed down from a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Now selling real estate in the south valley town of Gilroy, Winter recalled the 
1978 election, when he first ran as a lieutenant and still managed to defeat 
the incumbent sheriff with 59% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Once in office, he said, the public backed him each year when he complained 
that the Board of Supervisors was not allocating enough money to his department 
to properly staff the crowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
"The question was, did we want a strong sheriff or a submissive one?" said 
Winter, a gray-haired, 59-year-old conservative. "That was the deciding issue." 
</P>
<P>
While Winter was projecting the strong-sheriff image, the board saw him as a 
poor administrator unable to manage a budget. Board members were repeatedly 
upset with his cost overruns, much of them spent in overtime for jail deputies. 
One jail deputy earned more than $100,000 in a single year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the board, Winter overran his jail budget by more than $7.7 
million during four consecutive years in the 1980s, and, in 1987 alone, his 
$67-million budget was overspent by $3.5 million. And, while the board was 
making cuts in other county services and programs, the sheriff's budget for 
running the jails was increasing by 98%, although the jail population rose only 
34%. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the division of power in government, board members have limited 
authority, beyond setting the size of the budget, to oversee the way a sheriff 
manages his departments. According to the way county governments are set up, 
the elected boards approve the size of the sheriff's budget, but the elected 
sheriff decides how that money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
There were political omens too. Although Winter was seen as a popular figure at 
the polls, the board felt it was being cast in a dark light every time it 
attacked his management style. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Winter looked more like a sheriff than anyone I ever saw," said Supervisor 
Wilson. "He was tall, with wavy hair and guns on his hips. He was a good old 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He had good political skills, but he never managed a budget. He lacked 
administrative skills. Each year he doubled his overruns. The system was out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Zoe Lofgren, equally frustrated by the cost overruns, was slowly won 
over to Wilson's side, convinced that the board should invoke its powers to set 
up its own private corrections department. 
</P>
<P>
Lofgren said the board was then under a court order to ease jail crowding. 
There were pressures to implement more humane conditions for inmates. And, 
because the county was building new jail facilities anyway, she was convinced 
that a civilian Department of Correction was the best way to go. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of ambitious thinking fits her political style, she said. In her 
office hangs a portrait of Albert Einstein, with the caption: "Imagination is 
more important than knowledge." Bucking the time-honored tradition of letting 
elected sheriffs run the jails, she said, was an innovative idea, and there was 
always a chance that even repeat offenders could be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
"While you've got those guys locked up, why not try to turn them around?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Diridon was the least optimistic of the supervisors about embracing a 
separate corrections department. He studied other counties in the nation that 
tried a corrections system separate from the sheriff, and he worried that the 
cost would be too great if it failed. 
</P>
<P>
But he also understood that Winter and the board could not continue taking 
punches at each other and still provide good government. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bob Winter had had the personality that would have allowed him to work with 
the board, the board members never would have found the need to take the jails 
away from him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, president of the deputy's association during the jail fight, said the 
board's arguments were "a lot of bunk." He said Winter was never given enough 
money in the first place to run the jails, so of course he would have to 
authorize overtime and come in over budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if the board hired you to drive a truck to go to New York, but only 
gave you enough gas to get to Chicago," he said. "Does that mean you're a bad 
driver?" 
</P>
<P>
When the board members voted to create a Department of Correction, they told 
the public that most of the $62 million in savings would come from lower 
salaries for new correctional officers and reduced training costs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, correctional officers undergo a seven-week training 
course, as contrasted with 18 weeks for deputies, and they are paid a lower 
entry-level annual salary of about $30,000, versus about $41,000 for starting 
deputy sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
According to county figures, $8 million has been saved already under the new 
department, and the county should have saved $10.4 million by next June. The 
current jail budget is about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy's association did not buy the cost-savings arguments, and the group 
gathered 77,750 signatures to place an initiative on the 1988 ballot, asking 
that the county charter specifically declare that only the elected sheriff can 
run the jails. 
</P>
<P>
The board answered by placing its own advisory initiative on the same ballot, 
asking voters whether they supported a Department of Correction. Then politics 
took its course. 
</P>
<P>
The board labelled its initiative Measure A. The board then added four other 
less significant measures on the ballot, and then came the deputy's association 
proposal, Measure F. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Wilson said she helped raise $250,000, against the $750,000 that the 
deputy's association took from its building fund to fight the Department of 
Correction. While the proponents of Measure A were saying that Sheriff Winter 
was spending too much money, the deputy's association never forced the board to 
fully justify how it would save the $62 million, and to this day does not 
believe the savings are real. 
</P>
<P>
With radio, television and newspaper advertisements in full swing, the most 
popular refrain against the deputy's association proposal, still being heard 
with laughs in Santa Clara County, was simply, "F no." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it was good politics," said Lofgren, reflecting on the bitter election. 
"I think we were straight with the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Beck, the deputy's association president, said his group was far too naive in 
trying to defeat the politically savvy board members. If he had it to do over 
again, he said, "I would not play fair. I would go for the throat like they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits followed, and the state Supreme Court ruled in November, 1988, that 
the board could take over the jails. By January, when Winter formally turned 
the jail key over to newly hired Department of Correction Director Frank Hall, 
about $300,000 in legal fees for both sides had been borne by the taxpayers. 
Eighteen months of debate, campaigning and lawsuits were over. All that was 
left were bruised egos. 
</P>
<P>
Winter left office, and the board appointed an interim sheriff to serve the 
rest of his term. Without the jails, which had been two-thirds of Winter's 
domain, the new sheriff's responsibilities cover only the unincorporated areas 
of the county and law enforcement services for some contract cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We had supported so many of the board members in the past, and they were our 
friends," said Beck. "But they wanted Bob Winter so bad that they were willing 
to step on their friends." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson sympathized with the hard feelings at the deputy's association. But she 
alludes to the political maxim that "every person has to make their own 
decision. And then live with it." 
</P>
<P>
After years running state correctional systems in Massachusetts, Maryland and 
New York, Frank Hall moved in to Sheriff Winter's old office in San Jose. As 
the first director of the Department of Correction, he took control of a jail 
system that included two new detention facilities built in the aftermath of the 
lawsuits over crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Hall today has control of five jails with about 5,000 inmate beds, compared to 
seven jails and 4,269 inmates, as of last Wednesday, in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Hall also inherited a good portion of the sheriff's deputies still working in 
the jails, and today he supervises a correctional staff of 800 workers, 
including about 200 sworn deputies who have yet to be phased back into 
sheriff's patrol duties. 
</P>
<P>
He also implemented a direct supervision concept, with correctional officers 
overseeing the jail by mingling with inmates, rather than the traditional 
prison system of guards watching inmates from behind thick glass windows in 
steel-reinforced control rooms. 
</P>
<P>
He has brought local self-help agencies into the jails to work with inmates in 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation projects. He has set up incentive programs for 
inmates who with good conduct can earn perks such as extra candy bars and the 
right to select the evening videocassette tape. 
</P>
<P>
"I just finished 20 employee interviews, and no one mentioned poor morale," he 
said. "There's a whole new atmosphere here. We're trying to provide some new 
direction, some new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Doyle, a deputy sheriff for 18 years, is one of the remaining deputies 
still assigned to the jails. Once skeptical of direct supervision, he now is a 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, it does work," Doyle said. "We stopped being jailers and became inmate 
managers. And, if rehabilitation can happen, it will happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Several inmates in one of the drug programs, who have marked time under both 
Winter and Hall, were grateful for the chance to improve their lives. "I've 
been in prison seven times already," said 38-year-old Earl Soto, jailed now for 
possession of cocaine. "But, if I'd had this program before and this setting, 
maybe I wouldn't be back again." 
</P>
<P>
The deputy's association leadership doesn't believe for a second that county 
inmates are really being turned around. "That's hogwash," said Beck. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall and his staff said it was a worthy aim of the new corrections officers 
to at least try to change the lives of criminals. "I think we're making some 
real strides here," said David Gonzales, an assistant director of the new 
Department of Correction. 
</P>
<P>
Winter and Beck scoff at such optimism. They said that trying to rehabilitate 
county inmates, many of them headed for state prison, is a hopeless task, 
particularly since the average inmate spends only four months in the county 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Beck added that many of the correctional officers, who have been ridiculed as 
"Smurfs" because of their new blue uniforms, are learning fast that a jailhouse 
drug program doesn't always save souls. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not like working for Mr. Hall," Beck said. "Most of them don't care to 
work there. They don't care much for his operation." 
</P>
<P>
Beck and Winter noted that criminal charges were brought against some of the 
new correctional officers last year. One officer was charged with two felony 
counts of assaulting an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Winter is skeptical that the board really will save the $62 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pie-in-the sky figure," he said. "The board directed their controller 
to come up with a figure, and he dreamed one up." 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Wilson and Lofgren insisted the savings are real. "Our auditors 
didn't make this stuff up," said Lofgren. "We're tracking it, and we'll issue 
yearly report cards to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
But the board and Hall and others backing the civilian-run jail system stop 
short of pushing their system on other counties with similar problems, such as 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it here because it worked for us," Hall said. "We're proud of our 
system. But I'm not going to go demand everyone else go to a Department of 
Correction." 
</P>

DOG OWNERS MUST HEEL TO BEACH RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With urbanization, come regulations; small individual freedoms yield to the 
greater good. 
</P>
<P>
But last week Encinitas held the pressures of urbanization at bay in a small 
way when the city approved a six-month experiment to allow dogs to run free 
along a three-quarter-mile strip of beach, as long as their owners are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Most beaches are too crowded anymore to allow dogs to play Frisbee or jog with 
their owners or to romp in the surf -- for obvious reasons. Fiesta Island, a 
small piece of Ocean Beach called Dog Beach, and part of the Del Mar beach may 
be the only stretches left that don't require a dog to be on a leash, at least 
part of the year. Many beaches prohibit dogs altogether. 
</P>
<P>
But we're glad dog owners were able to persuade the Encinitas City Council to 
give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
Beacon's Beach was a state-run beach until recently, when the city of Encinitas 
took it over. Dogs were allowed there with a leash, but in practice often ran 
free. So this experiment just continues a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure of population growth will probably one day make the tradition 
impractical. Even now, it is only reasonable during certain hours of the day in 
summer. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, unleashed dogs will be allowed from 5 
a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But dog owners in Encinitas can learn from the experience of San Diego's Dog 
Beach, which came under fire last year because owners were not cleaning up 
after their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Only if owners consistently scoop up droppings and follow the rules to protect 
the bluffs will they be able to keep this small bit of casual beach-town 
flavor. And make a lot of dogs very happy.

Fire dispatcher Cornelia McDonough said she instantly knew the address of a 
burning home when a man called to report a white house on fire at 16th and 
Utica streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I would have to send the fire trucks to my own house," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire last week heavily damaged most of the family's property and killed the 
family dog. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hurtful," McDonough said. "Tzar had been with us for 12 years. He was 
part of the family. We all loved him." 
</P>
<P>
McDonough remained on duty and took several more calls from her neighbors about 
the fire before she was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Experience allowed her to remain composed while dispatching trucks to her own 
home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't had the job of dispatcher so long, I might have become 
hysterical," she said. "But when you are around this sort of thing all the time 
-- dealing with people in emergency situations -- you learn to put your own 
feelings on hold and just do your job."

DEBATE ON REFINERY ACID REPORT DELAYED BY AQMD OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: CRITICS SAY THE OVERLY PESSIMISTIC REPORT IS STACKED AGAINST USING 
HYDROFLUORIC ACID AND FAVORS SULFURIC ACID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heated criticism by fire and oil refinery officials of a report on dangers of a 
hydrofluoric acid spill has led air quality officials to postpone consideration 
of banning the acutely hazardous substance. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District board had been set to debate 
the matter March 2, but AQMD Deputy Director Ed Camarena told a meeting Friday 
that additional time is required to respond to criticism from members of an 
AQMD task force. 
</P>
<P>
The report was attacked by refinery users of hydrofluoric acid as being stacked 
against the substance and in favor of the less volatile sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Other critiques faulted the report for using overly pessimistic accident 
scenarios, for making unrealistic assumptions about the rate at which acid 
might leak and for failing to take into account the peculiarities of each 
installation using hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
The report was praised, however, by Fred Millar of the Environmental Policy 
Institute in Washington. His warnings about hydrofluoric acid leaks two years 
ago helped prompt the AQMD to set up the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Both hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids are hazardous chemicals that can be used 
by refineries as a catalyst to combine petroleum gases in making a high-octane 
unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, four refineries use hydrofluoric acid: Mobil Oil in 
Torrance, Ultramar in Wilmington, and the Powerine and Golden West refineries, 
both in Santa Fe Springs. In addition, an Allied-Signal plant in El Segundo 
uses hydrofluoric acid to manufacture refrigerants. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 24 report by the staff of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District used computer models to compare a major release of hydrofluoric acid 
with a similar release of sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
The report based its scenarios on a major release of hydrofluoric acid in 1987 
at a Marathon Oil refinery in Texas City, Tex., in which a crane dropped a 
30-ton piece of equipment on a 3 1/2-inch pipe connected to a tank filled with 
the substance. Within 100 minutes, approximately 7,000 gallons were released, 
according to the report. About 912 people were examined at hospitals; 39 were 
treated and released, and 97 were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Examining similar releases from storage tanks at each of the four refineries, 
the AQMD staff report said that hydrofluoric acid, which turns to hydrogen 
fluoride gas at room temperature, would endanger the public far more than a 
comparable release of sulfuric acid, which would remain a liquid and not turn 
into a gas unless heated to 518 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
At the AQMD task force meeting, Marshall (Bud) Bell, refinery manager of 
Ultramar, said that the release modeled in the report is overly pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as an incredible scenario," he said. "It is stacked in the wrong 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, whose refinery has just completed a $500,000 risk study for hydrofluoric 
acid, said that the AQMD staff had made a major mistake by failing to estimate 
the likelihood of the scenario that the report modeled. 
</P>
<P>
The Ultramar risk study says that the most probable type of release -- from a 
pump joint -- is likely to pose an immediate danger to life and health only 
once every 200 years, and that probability could be greatly reduced by 
modifying the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Munakata, a Mobil official, said he doubted that the Marathon accident had 
released acid at a rate as high as the AQMD study stated. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Richard Anderson, of the Los Angeles Fire Department, said that release 
scenarios should have been tailored to each installation. He added that a 
rupture of 3 1/2 inches is unrealistic for a Santa Fe Springs refinery in 
particular, because the pipes connected to its storage tank are all under two 
inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wilson, chief of the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department, said he was 
concerned that conversion to sulfuric acid would increase the number of trucks 
carrying sulfuric acid in his city. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is made up of 45 representatives of industry, public safety 
agencies, other governmental bodies, labor and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the task force officials at the meeting said they agreed with 
the report, Millar said in a telephone interview from Washington that the 
modeling study used conservative assumptions. He added that it conclusions 
supported his contention that hydrofluoric acid should be banned in favor of 
sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena said that the staff would make a status report to the AQMD board at 
the March 2 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries in Los Angeles County that use sulfuric acid are the Arco and Shell 
refineries in Carson, the Texaco and Unocal refineries in Wilmington and the 
Chevron refinery in El Segundo.

REFLECTIONS: 'WE HAD SOME TOUGH TIMES AND SOME GOOD TIMES. WE JUST KEPT ON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times reporter 
</P>
</BYLINE>

If Willis Roe, 94, and Reba Roe, 85, are a bit exhausted, it may be because, in 
addition to the usual holiday festivities, they also celebrated their 70th 
wedding anniversary Jan. 6 and Willis' birthday Tuesday. The couple received a 
congratulatory letter from President and Mrs. Bush and were feted with an 
anniversary luncheon by 41 members of their immediate family. Married in 1920, 
the couple shared memories of their life in an interview with Times reporter G. 
Jeanette Avent. They were photographed by Barbara Martin Pinhero. 
</P>
<P>
 REBA: When we were married, I was 16 and Willis was 24. Way back then, the age 
difference wasn't a concern. We lived way out in the country in the Ozarks, and 
we went to the same church. We met at the pie suppers and singings. On our 
wedding day, it was real snowy, and we got to the minister's house for the 
ceremony by horse and buggy. 
</P>
<P>
When we started out, we moved in with his dad and brother in a one-room log 
cabin. I was a young girl cooking for three men. But I had three brothers, so I 
was used to it. 
</P>
<P>
(We didn't have a telephone, electricity or radio, and there was no water in 
the house, Willis said.) 
</P>
<P>
We pumped water out of the well. When all my kids were growing up, I washed 
clothes on a washboard, and I made my own soap. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIS: In the early days, I did a little of everything to make a living. I 
would work a whole day for a quarter. A dime bought a loaf of bread. I think 
gasoline was 7 or 8 cents a gallon. We paid $5 or $6 a month for a log cabin we 
rented. Often I'd trade work for food. I've worked many a day for a pound of 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the Great Depression during the '30s. But I always managed to get 
some kind of a job. I didn't go out and say I had to have a certain thing to do 
or I wouldn't work. There weren't very many jobs. There weren't any factories 
near where we lived. If I got two or three days' work at the same place, I was 
lucky. 
</P>
<P>
We worked about all the time. There wasn't much time for entertainment. There 
were pie sales, and square dances in people's homes to raise money for the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
REBA: At Christmas, we'd cut a cedar tree in the woods. We made popcorn and 
strung it around the tree, and made paper chains out of different colors of 
paper. Kids now wouldn't be bothered with things we did then. Our kids would 
get maybe a pocket knife, a package of marbles or a bar of candy for Christmas. 
They usually got an orange, an apple maybe, and pencils. That's all we could 
give. There was nothing else at the store to buy. 
</P>
<P>
I never got to go to the store much because I had to tend to the little kids. 
But sometimes Willis would get me a vinyl oil cloth, or maybe a new broom. It 
sounds really silly to people now. Willis would take a load of wood to town or 
a load of railroad ties he made, and then he'd bring back the things we needed. 
To pay for the wood, some people would give some money and they would trade for 
the rest. Sometimes they would pay in milk or butter or grain. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIS: We sold the 80-acre farm we had bought for $900 and moved up to town to 
be closer to school. We were about 7 miles from Versailles in Missouri. I 
farmed there, rented some ground and kept my own team of mules. Then one of 
Reba's brothers and mother came out to California, and pretty soon we took a 
notion we'd come to California in 1937. We just sold out slick and clean. 
</P>
<P>
I had never owned a car in my life till then. But, when I went to Rancho Santa 
Fe for gardening work, I had to learn how to drive. I was 50 when I learned how 
to drive. My first car was a 1935 Chevy. I paid about $50 for it. 
</P>
<P>
I think our life together was a good life. I couldn't really say what I'd do 
differently. We had some tough times and some good times. We just kept on. But 
I'm satisfied with what I've done. We never depended upon anybody but 
ourselves. We had nothing given to us. But I don't regret any of it. 
</P>
<P>
REBA: We didn't make any particular promises to each other before we married. 
People didn't talk about things like that in those days. But I'd advise young 
couples just starting out in their marriage today to not do something in a 
rush. Stop and think it over. A lot of young people just want to run from their 
problems. I would advise them to stay in school if they haven't finished before 
they marry. Kids miss so much if they don't finish.

MEXICAN POLICE SAY BAJA MURDER CASE SOLVED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SLAIN NEWPORT BEACH BUSINESSMAN IS CLEARED BY 
POLICE, WHO SAID THAT TWO MEN HAVE CONFESSED TO THE 1988 ROBBERY-KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mexican police announced this week that they have solved the bizarre mystery of 
who killed the flamboyant Claude L. Falkenstien. They say two robbers confessed 
to shooting the Newport Beach businessman while his girlfriend crouched in the 
kitchen of his Baja California seaside home. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Mexican police had suspected that Falkenstien's girlfriend, Patricia 
Engels, was somehow involved in the shooting on the night of Nov. 6, 1988. 
Engels told police that a robber shot Falkenstien and fled with valuables, but 
investigators began doubting her story when the goods turned up a few days 
later in the trunk of a neighbor's car. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Engels returned to the United States and refused to submit to 
further questioning by Mexican police. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absurd that they accused her," said Malcolm Mike Guleserian, 
Falkenstien's lawyer and close friend of 10 years. "It was terrible. She 
watched him die and then was accused of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bethany Falkenstien, one of the dead man's three former wives, "Oh my 
God, after all this time -- it's unbelievable. . . . It's a relief. He was my 
best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact Engels through her parents and friends were unsuccessful on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two men who allegedly confessed to murdering the 58-year-old Falkenstien were 
identified as Sergio Gomez Ramirez, 39, who is jailed in Guadalajara on another 
crime, and Rodrigo Corona Lopez, 33, of Guadalajara, who was arrested this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
While being interrogated by prison officials, Gomez allegedly said he and 
Corona killed Falkenstien during a bungled robbery at the businessman's leased 
home in Playa La Mision, about 20 miles south of Rosarito, according to Genaro 
Valle Lopez, chief of the Mexican state judicial police in Rosarito. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez "told us how Falkenstien was dressed, where his girlfriend was -- and 
everything matched what the girlfriend told us," Valle said. "They are the ones 
who are to blame, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Mexican police believed Engels' account. Engels told officers that 
she was in the kitchen preparing dinner when two robbers burst into the house, 
shot Falkenstien and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Engels said she had reached for a pistol hidden under a dresser and fired shots 
in the air outdoors to scare the robbers away and signal for help. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, police held Engels and some neighbors for questioning, then 
released them. Engels returned to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But as the investigation proceeded, odd details surfaced. Co-workers at 
Falkenstien's Newport Beach ad company, Mass Media Marketing, said he had 
introduced Engels, 38, not as his girlfriend but as his daughter. The neighbors 
who owned the car in which Falkenstien's valuables were found turned out to be 
wanted by police on suspicion of stealing $20,000 worth of birds in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And Falkenstien, a Balboa Bay Club member who was fond of heavy gold jewelry 
and spent nearly every weekend in Baja, turned out to have owned a business 
that was more than $180,000 in debt at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican police also learned of a $120,000 life insurance policy that was to be 
split between Engels and Delores Falkenstien, the dead man's first wife and 
executor of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
It was suspicion that Engels had not told the truth about the theft of 
Falkenstien's wallet, briefcase and jewelry that primarily led investigators to 
believe that she knew something more about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did she do that?" Valle wondered. "Maybe to justify that an assault really 
happened? Maybe she was just scared we wouldn't believe her." 
</P>
<P>
Valle said Gomez and Corona have also confessed to committing a string of Playa 
La Mision house robberies in the weeks before Falkenstien's death. 
</P>
<P>
Valle said Mexican police are publicizing the closing of the Falkenstien case 
in the hope that Engels will return to Mexico to identify Corona and Gomez, if 
they were the intruders who killed Falkenstien. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution of Gomez and Corona will proceed with or without Engels' 
help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez will finish serving a sentence for robbery and assault before being 
sentenced on his apparent confession in Falkenstien's death, Valle said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona, who is held in Rosarito, will be sentenced within the next month, Valle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that each man will spend at least 30 years in prison for 
Falkenstien's death.

SANTA CLARITA DEDICATES BIGGEST PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest and most eagerly anticipated park in the Santa Clarita Valley was 
dedicated Saturday during a ceremony that at times was drowned out by the roar 
of blustery winds and the sounds of children who couldn't wait to get on the 
new playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials, along with state Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley), praised the 17-acre Canyon Country Park as a much-needed facility that 
demonstrated the City Council's commitment to providing quality services to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"When we became a city in 1987, we surveyed people on what they wanted to see 
most in Santa Clarita, and parks came in second to roads," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy 
said. "This has been a long time coming, but this is really a big move and a 
great day for us. It's the first major capital project we've done." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita Planning Commissioner Louis E. Brathwaite said: "This is just the 
beginning of something big. We have plans for a lot of other parks, and we're 
going to have equestrian trails to connect all of them." 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 people watched as Darcy cut a ribbon stretched across the 
playground of the park, which is on a hill above the 17600 block of West 
Soledad Canyon Boulevard. Traffic from the nearby Antelope Valley Freeway 
combined with the strong winds to drown out some of the speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a playground and community center, the $2.5-million park has a 
softball and soccer field, a path for walking and jogging and a fitness course. 
Parks and recreation officials said they plan to spend another $2 million in 
coming years on a pool, two tennis courts, three handball courts and a 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the crowd toured the newly constructed community center. A 
brass ensemble played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" as kids and their parents 
feasted on hot dogs and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Country parents had long complained that they didn't have any parks to 
go to in an area burgeoning with new houses. In fact, the tiny playground at a 
local McDonald's restaurant had served as a popular surrogate park for 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the city had complained that Los Angeles County had dragged its feet 
about adding parks to the fast-growing region before it became incorporated as 
a city. They said the county was too casual about collecting fees from 
developers that would have paid for new parks and that the city accomplished in 
two years what the county couldn't do in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But John Weber, assistant director of the county Parks and Recreation 
Department, said the county didn't start planning the park until 1985. When 
Santa Clarita became a city, all plans and $1.2 million in fees were turned 
over from the county to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the county dragged its feet at all," Darcy said. "We're just 
glad we were able to get this done so fast." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Clarita raised the remainder of the funding through state 
grants, donations and other contributions, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad it's here," said Ellen Stuart, a resident who held her infant 
daughter as she admired the park. "It took a while, but it's going to be here 
for generations."

61 ARRESTED AT ANTI-ABORTION RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police Saturday arrested 61 anti-abortion demonstrators who tried to 
block the office of a Hillcrest physician. 
</P>
<P>
All of those arrested were expected to be released pending court dates. 
</P>
<P>
All were to be charged with misdemeanor violations, including trespassing, 
failing to disperse for police officers and resisting arrest at the 
demonstration site on Fourth Avenue, just north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there were no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Six of those arrested complained of bruised wrists and paramedics were 
summoned, said police spokesman David Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
No police officers were injured, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were members of Operation Rescue, a nationwide anti-abortion 
group that dramatizes its cause by trying to shut down family planning centers 
and physicians who provide family planning services.

WORKER HURT WHEN HE FALLS INTO PLANT BOILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction worker at a Santa Clarita power plant suffered serious head and 
neck injuries when he fell 25 feet into an empty boiler Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon McBrayer, 34, was lifted out of the four-foot-wide hole in the boiler 
with a crane and then flown by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital, said Howard Spinrad, a Los Angeles County firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
McBrayer fell about 6:30 a.m., shortly after the end of his shift at the AES 
Placerita co-generation power plant. He lay there for about 10 to 15 minutes 
until a co-worker noticed he was missing and heard his moans. 
</P>
<P>
McBrayer was still conscious when rescuers pulled him out, Spinrad said. He was 
in serious condition Saturday night, a hospital spokeswoman said.

3 AREA CITIES MISS DEADLINE TO SHOW QUAKE SAFETY COMPLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN and ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cities of Hawthorne, Lawndale and Lomita, where inspectors identified a 
total of 27 older masonry buildings that could suffer serious damage during an 
earthquake, have missed a Jan. 1 deadline to complete the first step toward 
complying with the state's earthquake safety law. 
</P>
<P>
All cities and counties in seismically active zones, such as Los Angeles and 
San Francisco, are required under a 1986 state law to identify their 
unreinforced masonry buildings and provide a program to reduce the potential 
for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hawthorne have identified 10 older masonry buildings that they 
believe are unreinforced. County authorities have identified three such 
buildings in Lawndale and 14 in Lomita. City officials in each community said 
they are working to meet the state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Because some of the buildings may already have been reinforced, property owners 
are being given an opportunity to provide proof that their buildings have been 
upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
Once the unreinforced masonry buildings have been identified and a plan to 
lessen the potential for injuries and damage has been adopted, state law 
requires the cities and counties to report their progress to the state Seismic 
Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline was Jan. 1, but commission spokesman Ed Hensley said there is no 
penalty for failing to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, Lawndale and Lomita were among 44 cities in the state that did not 
report progress toward complying with the state law before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
By Jan. 1, about 25% of the 366 cities in 30 counties covered by the law met 
all the requirements; 23% finished the inventory; 21% were working on the 
inventory; and 13% did not report progress, according to commission officials. 
The remaining 18% of the jurisdictions had no unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, five cities -- Gardena, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Manhattan 
Beach and Torrance -- met all the requirements before the deadline. Redondo 
Beach, Carson, El Segundo, Avalon and Palos Verdes Estates reported some 
progress to the state before Jan. 1 and are working to meet remaining state 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates reported having no 
unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles met all the requirements of the law by the deadline. 
The county met all deadlines for its unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
The most common unreinforced masonry buildings are brick buildings that were 
built before 1933 without steel reinforcement in the walls. Many seismic 
experts believe these buildings pose the greatest threat to life during 
earthquakes because masonry cannot absorb rocking and swaying motions. 
</P>
<P>
Because the walls, ceilings and floors of unreinforced masonry buildings 
vibrate at different speeds and in different directions during a quake, they 
are likely to separate and collapse, according to experts. Steel reinforcements 
on such buildings allow the entire structure to vibrate as one and thus sustain 
less damage. 
</P>
<P>
Upgrading such a building can cost as much as $20 per square foot -- $120,000 
for the average 6,000-square-foot building, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale City Manager James Arnold said the city contracted with the building 
and safety division of the county's Public Works Department in October to help 
Lawndale meet the state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
According to Richard Glenn, senior building inspector for the Public Works 
Department, the county was asked to identify the unreinforced masonry buildings 
in Lawndale, to notify the property owners and to request proof of whether the 
buildings are reinforced. Once that is completed, the county will send its 
findings to the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a county ordinance also adopted by Lawndale last year, owners of older 
masonry buildings are asked to provide proof if their buildings have been 
reinforced. Property owners who cannot provide proof are given 270 days to 
submit a plan to bring their buildings up to code or to demolish them. Glenn 
said adoption of that ordinance meets the state requirement for a mitigation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said the county began the inventory about three months ago and assured 
the city that it would be finished in time to meet the Jan. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we missed the deadline, there is no question about that," he said. "What 
can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
Glenn said he does not know when the county will complete the inventory in 
Lawndale, but he said his agency did not promise Lawndale it could meet the 
deadline. He said the county reminded Lawndale of the requirements of the state 
law about a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold declined to identify any specific buildings until the inventory is 
completed, but he said they are near Hawthorne Boulevard and 147th Street. He 
said the city will soon notify the state Seismic Safety Commission about its 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Building and Safety Director Donald Knechtel said the city hired 
David Breiholv &amp; Associates of Lomita about five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the firm to help the city meet state requirements before 
the deadline but was told that it has been hampered because of difficulty in 
identifying the owners of a few older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Knechtel said the owners will be identified soon, and he expects the 
inventory to be completed within a month. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to identify any specific building until the inventory is 
completed, although he said most of the buildings that need upgrading are 
located along Hawthorne Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As in Lawndale, Lomita city officials have also contracted with the county in 
order to meet the state requirements, said Senior Planner Richard Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Kondo, manager of the Public Works Department's district office in 
Lomita, said 14 "potentially hazardous buildings" in need of reinforcement have 
been identified in the city. Most are aging structures that house small 
businesses near Lomita Square, a commercial business center at the intersection 
of Lomita Boulevard and Narbonne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kondo said the city's inventory will not be completed until property 
owners respond to a county request for proof that their buildings are 
reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one building at the Lomita Square intersection, David Harned of 
Harned Realty, said he received a letter from the county about two weeks ago 
advising him that his building was on the county's list. 
</P>
<P>
In a written response to the county, Harned said an architect and a 
construction foreman had advised him unofficially that the building's brick 
structure was reinforced, but he does not have an engineer's verification. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the city and county wanting to ensure the safety of the 
general public," Harned said in an interview. "But if they tell me it isn't 
(reinforced), I don't know where I'm at." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is worried that the cost of reinforcing his building could be so 
high that he will be forced to demolish the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Other South Bay cities that have not met all the requirements of the law are at 
different stages of completion. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Redondo Beach is drafting an ordinance to establish an earthquake 
damage mitigation program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance -- which is expected to go before the City Council 
sometime next month -- property owners would have 60 days to appeal a city 
finding that a building needs seismic work. After that, the owner would get 180 
days to prove the building is safe, to demolish it or to submit plans for 
bringing it up to code within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next three months, the city of El Segundo is expected to enact an 
ordinance based on the county law. City officials there have identified nine 
unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Carson enacted a law that gives building owners a year and a half to 
demolish a building or three years to complete the reinforcement of the 
structure. Officials there identified 39 unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ordinance required the city to give building owners a grace period 
of six months before issuing any formal notices to comply, city officials said. 
That grace period ends next month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Palos Verdes Estates, where there are two unreinforced 
buildings, are also considering an earthquake mitigation law based on the 
county ordinance. The ordinance should be before the council in the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Avalon has also contracted with the county, which is working to get 
responses from property owners there about whether they have proof that their 
buildings are reinforced. Avalon has adopted the county ordinance for 
unreinforced masonry structures and has 24 such buildings.

PIT BULL ATTACK SENDS MAN TO HOSPITAL WITH DEEP CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two pit bulls attacked a 60-year-old Hawthorne man who had left his house to 
get a morning newspaper Saturday, sending him to a hospital with deep wounds on 
his arms and one leg, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Raymond Collin was in serious condition at Robert F. Kennedy Medical 
Center in Hawthorne and was expected to need extensive surgery to replace 
tissue lost on his limbs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He suffered severe lacerations and punctures, and lots of skin was torn away 
on both arms and his left leg," Hawthorne Police Lt. Jan Ogden said. "Some (of 
the cuts) look to be three or four inches long. He's going to need skin 
grafts." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second attack by pit bull-type dogs locally in two weeks. Marjee 
Lilly, 70, died Jan. 18 after she was mauled in South-Central Los Angeles by 
her grandson's two dogs, both part pit bull terrier and part boxer. Her death 
was the second known fatal attack by a pit bull-type dog in Los Angeles County. 
The first was that of a Hawthorne boy in 1983, prompting the city to enact 
tougher restrictions on dangerous dogs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dogs that attacked Collin also bit his 87-year-old father last July, 
Hawthorne animal control officials said. The owner, who lives on the same 
street as Collin, was cited after that incident. Police declined to release the 
owner's name. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ogden said Collin left his home in the 11500 block of Grevillea Avenue 
about 7 a.m. Saturday to buy a newspaper at a nearby store. 
</P>
<P>
"On his way home, the pit bull attacked him," Ogden said. "During the attack, a 
second pit bull also got loose and joined the attack." 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified passer-by reportedly stopped his car and rushed to help Collin 
fend off the dogs, said Tori Matthews, an animal control officer at the 
Southern California Humane Society shelter in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
"People do not have any business owning dogs that attack like this," she said. 
"It was unprovoked." 
</P>
<P>
The animals, a male and a female believed to be 1 or 2 years of age, were 
placed in separate isolation kennels behind double-locked fences at the 
shelter.

Prudential Insurance Co. said Friday it will make so-called "living payouts" to 
life insurance policyholders who are terminally ill or permanently confined to 
a nursing home to help ease their last months. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential, based in Newark, N.J., said the benefit option will be available on 
current policies having death benefits of at least $25,000 and on new policies 
of at least $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The option will be offered at no additional cost, the insurer said.

UPPER MIDWEST DIGS OUT AFTER STORM CUTS OFF POWER, CLOSES 3 AIRPORTS

<P>
The upper Midwest was digging out Friday from a fierce storm with high winds 
that dumped as much as 15 inches of snow, blacked out at least 138,000 power 
customers, blew roofs off buildings and closed three major airports. 
</P>
<P>
Four people died of heart attacks while shoveling snow from the storm, 
authorities said, three in Wisconsin and one in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning injured 12 people in Illinois, and snow made driving treacherous from 
Iowa to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the rural mailman's worst nightmare," said Tanis Lehmann, postmaster 
in Cedar, Mich. "I worry like a mother hen until my carriers come back." 
</P>
<P>
More than a foot of snow fell in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities reported at least 84,000 customers lost power in Michigan, 44,000 in 
Wisconsin and 10,000 in Illinois. In most cases, power was back on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, which got nearly 10 inches of 
snow, was closed for 13 hours Thursday because of drifting snow and poor 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Airports in St. Louis and Detroit closed for shorter periods of time, while 
O'Hare and Midway airports in Chicago remained open but had at least half their 
flights canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven people were struck by lightning in a factory parking lot in Crystal 
Lake, Ill., 35 miles northwest of Chicago, and a 12th person was struck in 
nearby Palatine. None were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel lucky to be alive," said Apolonio Pena, 37, one of the Precision Twist 
Drill Co. workers struck by lightning as they were trying to help push cars out 
of 6 inches of new snow. The bolt hit a telephone pole next to the plant and 
traveled through the snow. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big, loud boom and then a flash," Pena said. "I felt like I had 
been knocked down, but I was really standing up. It was really strange. Sparks 
came out of my fingers."

MAN DIES AFTER POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County Sheriff's homicide officers are investigating the case of an 
unidentified man who collapsed and died Friday after being arrested by San 
Diego police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim -- a black male in his mid-20s -- remained unknown 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was expected to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police placed the man in custody shortly before 3 p.m. Friday after a 
short chase on foot in Southeast San Diego, according to accounts provided by 
the sheriff's and police departments. He was arrested on suspicion of burglary, 
possession of stolen property and possession of drug paraphernalia, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after being arrested, police said, the man collapsed for unknown 
reasons and was rushed to Paradise Valley Hospital in National City. He was 
pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m., the coroner's office said.

WIKE FOLLOWED THE GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 16, in a spate of political demagoguery, the Rancho Palos Verdes City 
Council, led by pro-overdevelopers Jacki Bacharach, Mel Hughes and Doug 
Hinchliffe, removed Luella Wike from the Rancho Palos Verdes Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Luella consistently adhered to the General Plan and tried to preserve the 
Rancho Palos Verdes ambience to the maximum extent possible. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, would you believe that the reason Bacharach said she voted against 
Luella was because Luella was "overzealous"! Yes, indeed, Luella was 
overzealous. She insisted on researching and studying the proposed development 
projects. She wanted input from staff, she was responsive to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
As if this one action were not bad enough, the (council) appointed Robert E. 
McNulty as chairman of the Planning Commission. Should we remind the residents 
that Mr. McNulty was thoroughly discredited in the last election? Out of a 
field of eight candidates, Mr. McNulty came in seventh! In fact, two of the 
"new" commissioners, McNulty and Peter Van Hagen, consistently voted against 
the residents and violated the principles of "Save Our Coastline" during their 
prior terms as commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
We do not want to sound like a Cassandra, with doom and gloom, but frankly, 
fellow residents of Rancho Palos Verdes, our time for a beautiful, semi-rural 
atmosphere in our city is fast running out. Welcome to Santa Monica!

Forget Old MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bendix is a farmer, Southern California style. 
</P>
<P>
No John Deere reapers for him. No chemical pesticides. No corn as high as an 
elephant's eye. Bendix is in the boutique end of the agriculture business. He 
raises glamorous greens, pesticide-free herbs and edible flowers for 
restaurants with names that sound like sports cars and chefs as famous as their 
celebrity customers. The only corn he raises produces tiny, trendy ears the 
size of his pinky. Nor does Bendix toil in one of California's scorching 
interior valleys. Bendix tills the virgin soil of Malibu. You should have as 
good a view of the Pacific as his 22 varieties of lettuce have. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those amazing success stories," said Bendix, 42, whose business 
has grown in a couple of years from a back-yard herb garden to a flourishing 
specialty produce operation whose high-profile clients include the Hard Rock 
Cafes. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Beverly Hills High School ("the Class of Richard Dreyfuss"), 
Bendix became a farmer the Hollywood way. Until 1988 he was a full-time TV 
writer: His recent work included last year's short-lived "Dolphin Cove" series. 
Then the writer's strike struck. Hard-pressed to pay the mortgage on his 
acre-and-a-half Malibu mini-estate, Bendix and girlfriend (now partner) Robin 
Elmasian put 12 pounds of home-grown basil into his VW Rabbit and pitched it to 
a nearby restaurant. Heartened by that first sale, Bendix and Elmasian took 
their basil to a dozen upscale eateries in the Los Angeles area, 10 of which 
are now regular accounts. 
</P>
<P>
From the basic "Scarborough Fair" herbs -- basil, thyme, rosemary, dill and 
tarragon -- that are a fixture of every newlywed's spice rack, Bendix has 
expanded to 110 different products, including such rare and exotic herbs as 
caraway thyme, curry plant and Joseph's coat, also called Chinese spinach. 
Basil is still an important part of his business, especially since the recent 
hard frost in the Southeast destroyed Florida's basil along with its citrus 
crops. But Bendix's basil includes such uncommon types as cinnamon and a 
large-leaf variety that is good for stuffing. One of his chef clients wraps the 
big, fragrant leaves around mozzarella and prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
To guarantee freshness, Bendix said, "We have guys who go out to pick at 3 
o'clock in the morning with miners' lights on." Occasionally, Bandit or the 
other burro on the farm packs herbs up and down the hills. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to baby corn and other miniature vegetables, Bendix raises baby 
orchids and other edible flowers. Personally, he likes small, unusual flowers 
-- pansies are little too obvious for his taste. He prefers to see food 
decorated with tiny sprays of lavender flowers ("they look almost Art Deco") or 
the pretty little lilac-tinted flowers cilantro gives forth (they taste like 
cilantro, he pointed out, just as the star-shaped purple flowers of garlic 
chives taste like their pungent namesake). He also raises nasturtiums that can 
be whizzed in a food processor to add spice to a salad dressing as well as used 
as a garnish. And for the host who wants to end his or her barbecue with a 
flourish, he has peppermint geranium leaves. Guests can use them instead of 
disposable towels to wipe the sauce from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Bendix likes this business is that he likes to eat. When he 
talks about salad, for instance, it is with the enthusiasm of a true foodie. 
"You have your crunchies. You've got your soft lettuces, you've got your 
buttery lettuces, and then you've got your spices like the cresses." 
</P>
<P>
Bendix, Elmasian and a third partner -- Robin's sister, Susie Elmasian -- 
actually have two companies, Malibu Herb Farms, where they raise their organic 
produce, and a distributing arm, Malibu Farms. The business includes Bendix's 
Malibu property, 20 acres of rented fields elsewhere in Malibu, a 60-acre 
organic farm in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and space in downtown Los Angeles 
where the produce is prepared for delivery. Malibu Farms supplies its 
customers, most of them restaurants and hotels, with such edible exotica as 
truffles, Tahitian pineapples, cherimoyas and quail eggs in addition to foods 
grown on the company's farms. 
</P>
<P>
Bendix believes that his produce has a special quality as a result of being 
grown without chemicals on Westside real estate. As a student of environmental 
management at USC, he saw the way smog stunted the growth of spinach. "We 
basically get no smog here, and there's a breeze every day," he said. "I think 
our products reflect that nice microclimate we have." 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, boutique farming is a fashion business. Nobody wants to be seen 
eating last year's produce. What's hot is anything the chefs haven't seen 
before, Bendix said. Currently, miner's lettuce -- a spade-shaped green 
indigenous to North America -- is moving well at $10 to $12 a pound. Radicchio, 
on the other hand, only recently omnipresent, is out, out, out, so out that 
Bendix doesn't include it in his popular lettuce mix (a "fave" of Liz Taylor, 
he said). Instead, he adds color to the melange with red-and-green Chinese 
spinach. In search of tomorrow's trends, Bendix attends growers gatherings in 
the Netherlands and elsewhere. In the near future, he promised, "I'm bringing 
back two potatoes that have never been seen in Los Angeles before." 
</P>
<P>
Bendix, who has 40 employees, sees continued growth in the future: new products 
and new lines, including seasoned oils and vinegars. But just in case the 
bottom drops out of the arugula business, he has options. The Malibu farmer 
currently has a TV series in development. It's called "Capers," and the 
protagonist, who gets in and out of scrapes as he travels around the world, is, 
of course, a chef.

CAMBODIAN PAPERS WAGE WAR OF WORDS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: ONCE THE TARGET OF BARBS IN THE LOCAL CAMBODIAN NEWSPAPER, A COMMUNITY 
LEADER HAS RESPONDED WITH HIS OWN PUBLICATION.

<P>
For four years Than Pok suffered the barbs published in Serey Pheap, one of 
America's most widely read Cambodian-language newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
There were articles accusing him of not doing much for the Cambodian community. 
And editorials implying that he and other Cambodian leaders were abusing the 
public trust. Then there was an editorial referring to him derisively as "the 
Lord Than Pok," implying that he was interested only in his own 
self-aggrandizement and questioning his personal morals. 
</P>
<P>
Finally Pok, executive director of United Cambodian Community, the country's 
largest Cambodian social service agency, got mad. "The paper is too negative," 
he said during a recent interview in which he adamantly denied all of the 
accusations. "We need much more positive reporting about the (Cambodian) 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Pok didn't just write a letter to the editor. He started his own twice-monthly 
newspaper called Jati Khmer, which in English means "Cambodian Nation." Just 
out with its third edition, the paper is being touted by its publisher as an 
upbeat alternative to the weekly Serey Pheap, which translates as "Freedom." 
And despite the claims of both principals that they are not competing, the 
situation has all the earmarks of a Cambodian newspaper war. 
</P>
<P>
"We are responding to a need," said Pok, 48. "I don't agree with the way they 
approach journalism." 
</P>
<P>
Narin Kem, the chain-smoking engineering student who publishes Serey Pheap, 
said: "I have no competition. People are smart enough to understand which paper 
they should read." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the battle is a classic confrontation between the forces of the 
establishment and those who would question its authority. Pok, a well-educated 
former Cambodian government official, has emerged since his 1973 arrival in the 
United States as a highly visible and often-quoted spokesman for the Cambodian 
community in Long Beach and beyond. Occasionally he travels to Washington to 
speak on Cambodian issues. And as head of the country's largest Cambodian 
social service agency with an annual budget of $2.5 million, he is in a 
position to command money, power, influence and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Kem, 37, lives in a different world. A part-time student of engineering and 
industrial technology at Cal State Long Beach, he worked briefly as a 
journalist before leaving Cambodia in the mid-1970s. Arriving in the United 
States in 1981 after living in Vietnam, he favors leather jackets and tends to 
share the decidedly anti-establishment sentiments of his countrymen who 
personally suffered under the brutal dictatorship of Pol Pot. 
</P>
<P>
Kem started his paper on a shoestring in 1985 in order, he says, to provide an 
"independent and free" voice for the thousands of Cambodian refugees who had 
settled in Southern California. An estimated 40,000 of them live in Long Beach, 
giving the city the largest Cambodian population outside of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with 24 pages and 3,000 copies, Kem's paper soon grew to a hefty 64 
pages, achieved a national circulation of about 10,000, and, according to one 
recent survey, is seen by about 43% of the Cambodians living in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of an eight-member staff, many of them idealistic volunteers, Kem 
publishes the paper from the cluttered office he shares with a Vietnamese tax 
accountant on Anaheim Street in the heart of the city's Cambodian district. "We 
kept silent too long," he said. "Even if the truth hurts, we have to say it." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the truth, according to Kem, is that much of the Cambodian leadership, 
both in Southern California and in Cambodia, is ineffectual. "They call 
themselves leaders," he said, "but who voted for them? I'm a cynical person. 
(People) want me to take sides, but no leaders have my respect." 
</P>
<P>
Kem publishes a paper that is usually irreverent, often confrontational, 
sometimes sexually explicit, and generally reminiscent of the so-called 
"underground" weeklies that flourished in the United States during the late 
1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Recent editions, for instance, have featured critical depictions, not only of 
the current Cambodian government, but of major elements of the guerrilla 
coalition attempting to overthrow it. In addition, there was a graphically 
illustrated love story by a local refugee, stories about atrocities in refugee 
camps, bits of homespun witticisms on life in America and satirical bits poking 
fun at journalists and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
One recent cover even featured a cartoon caricature of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, 
leader of one of Cambodia's insurgent factions, standing with a bottle of 
French Champagne in his pocket and holding a copy of Playboy magazine featuring 
a graphic depiction of a male sex organ. 
</P>
<P>
Pok's publication, by contrast, is cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Its Dec. 15 inaugural edition led off with a front-page editorial by Pok 
promising to work toward the "healing, rebuilding and development" of the 
Cambodian community through love rather than hatred and patience rather than 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much negative reporting in the current Cambodian newspaper sowing 
mistrust and hatred among people," Pok wrote in an English translation 
published two weeks later. "We propose to report positive achievement, 
promoting trust and friendship among people, working together for the 
betterment and progress of our community." 
</P>
<P>
The initial edition went on to feature essays on Cambodian literature and 
culture, analytical pieces on events in Cambodia, a staff-written poem in which 
a father advises his son on how to live in America while preserving his 
Cambodian roots, photographs of disabled children playing table tennis in a 
Cambodian refugee camp and a page containing pictures of glamorous-looking 
young women from Russia, Singapore and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the paper is published out of the Atlantic Avenue headquarters of the 
United Cambodian Community, Pok said, it is not affiliated with that 
organization nor with any political party or special interest. Instead, he 
said, it is owned by a private corporation under his leadership which puts out 
the 44-page publication with a skeleton staff and a desktop computer at a cost 
of about $3,000 per edition. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that money comes from advertisements, Pok said. But most of it, he 
said, has come from the sale of $100 "shares" to Cambodians interested in 
supporting the paper which, so far, has a circulation of about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be objective," Pok said. "We try not to take sides." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that philosophy, Pok says, he will refrain from printing 
responses to any future barbs by Kem. Kem, on the other hand, seemed intent on 
escalating his attacks when, three days after the premier appearance of Jati 
Khmer, his newspaper devoted its entire cover to derisive caricatures of 
several local Cambodian leaders, including Pok, under an ambiguous headline 
that he translated as "Ambition, Ambition, Ambition, Ambition." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the so-called leaders are stupid," Kem explained. "I stand for no 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Pok: "I'm concerned about the community in general. We don't need 
this kind of press."

BATTLE LINES ARE BEING DRAWN IN AREA CODE SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in nine cities are looking for ways to fight a telephone company plan 
that would split the cities in two, giving some -- but not all -- of their 
residents a new area code in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The result, they say, would be confusion that could clog emergency phone lines, 
damage businesses and sacrifice city unity for easy profits. 
</P>
<P>
In Bell Gardens, for example, the current 213 and new 310 area codes would 
bisect the business district, forcing one bank to dial long-distance to reach 
its biggest customer across the street. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, homes on three streets would not be linked with their own 
prestigious community by area code, but with downtown Los Angeles, around which 
the new U-shaped 310 code wraps. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, 12 addresses would be reached by dialing 213, while the rest of 
the city would be assigned to 310. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that angers us most is that nobody ever talked to us about this," 
said West Hollywood Mayor Abbe Land, whose city would be split almost in half 
along La Cienega Boulevard. "The phone company made a decision and said, 'Live 
with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care which area code we get, we just want one," she added. 
</P>
<P>
When announcing the plan last month, representatives from GTE California and 
Pacific Bell said the companies had no choice but to create two area codes out 
of the old 213 zone because they were running out of phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
They said their engineers had examined 20 options to find a plan under which 
very few cities would be divided by codes when the 310 area is formed in two 
years. The splitting of cities "was unavoidable . . . because telephone 
exchanges and city limits are not related," the companies maintained in a press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that dialing an extra four digits to reach a neighbor might be 
an inconvenience but would carry no extra cost. And customers would keep their 
old seven-digit numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But officials from South Gate to Inglewood to West Hollywood have fielded 
dozens of calls from residents and businesses about the phone companies' 
failure to shape the new 310 area code to match city borders. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the phone companies' insistence that such a match is nearly impossible 
technically -- and would be very costly if feasible -- officials from most 
divided cities remain critical of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Some have demanded to know the precise cost of putting their cities into a 
single area code. (GTE now estimates the average cost at $1,854 per individual 
phone line.) Others have questioned the phone companies' statements of good 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did was take the (path) that was most cost-effective for them," Bell 
Gardens City Manager Claude Booker said. "I think they did one study -- how to 
maximize profits." 
</P>
<P>
In Bell Gardens, as in neighboring Commerce, the phone companies followed their 
own franchise lines, rather than forge new borders that would match the 
political boundaries of the two cities, the phone companies confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said he has contacted all other divided cities -- including neighboring 
Commerce, South Gate and Lynwood -- in an effort to build a united front 
against the plan at the Public Utilities Commission, in the Legislature and 
possibly in court. The utilities commission has no authority to veto the plan, 
but Booker said appealing to the commission could generate pressure against 
splitting cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell Gardens City Council declared its opposition to the split on Monday, 
saying in a resolution that the change "appears to be self-serving for two 
monopolies at the expense of our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Shepard, city administrator of Commerce, agreed. "They're ignoring 
anything other than their own convenience," he said of the phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in a coalition is also apparently building on the Westside and in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken with council members from Inglewood and Beverly Hills, and they're 
angry too," said Land of West Hollywood, who maintains that a legal challenge 
to the plan is her city's final option. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Mayor Joselle Smith said she thinks "there will be a cooperative 
response by all the cities affected." 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, Councilman Daniel Tabor's home would be in a different area code 
than his City Hall office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's irritating, it's inconvenient and it's confusing," he said of the plan. 
"For example, I've got calls from people who want to know how they'd call the 
police in another area code." 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials say that citizens would still call 911 for emergency 
police and fire service in both area codes. But city officials say they are 
concerned that residents making non-emergency calls may clog the 911 line to 
avoid a long-distance call to police. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they will dial 911 because they can dial it quickly," Booker said. 
"You and I know it always registers extra money when you dial long-distance. 
And (residents) are going to continue to think that." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue said, in fact, that a survey of calls to the 
regional emergency dispatch center used by his city shows that residents do not 
take quickly to change: About half still use an old emergency number instead of 
911, which has been in effect about five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't change habits very easily," Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also say that local businesses -- especially those such as 
restaurants and retail shops, which rely heavily on customer whim -- are 
concerned that customers may not search two area codes to find telephone 
numbers, opting instead for a competitor in the same city with the same area 
code. 
</P>
<P>
The phone companies say such concerns are common when new codes are 
established, but that the problems have never developed. 
</P>
<P>
Seven cities or communities were split in 1984, when the 818 area code was 
implemented in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. The greatest concern 
was in South Pasadena and Monterey Park, because significant parts of each were 
in different codes, Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lissa Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we haven't heard anything from them since that time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City and business representatives in Monterey Park said fears of problems from 
the split proved unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not recall any kind of increase in our 911 traffic" because of the 
change, said Georgette Hudson, supervisor of the city's emergency dispatch 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Olson, manager of the Chamber of Commerce, said business did not 
suffer. "There was adjustment on the part of the people, but there really were 
no problems whatsoever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A campaign against the 310 boundaries reached the Legislature in early January, 
just two weeks after the phone companies announced their plan. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, whose district includes Beverly Hills and Culver 
City, said the effect on business is one of the reasons that he has authored a 
bill intended to make phone companies more accountable when drafting new area 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's bill, which unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday, would 
require public notice from phone companies before they implement new codes. It 
would also force the companies to consider a set of criteria -- including 
geographical features, common interests and the cohesiveness of communities -- 
before dividing cities into two area codes. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities have backed the bill, although some officials said they favored 
an outright prohibition on city splitting, as was proposed early this month by 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). Moore withdrew her bill last week for 
lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
According to the phone companies, Rosenthal's measure is unnecessary. The 
companies say they have given affected cities and the public more than two 
years' notice of the new 310 zone and are arranging detailed presentations to 
the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic Gomez, area vice president for Pacific Bell, said his company 
considered all the factors listed in Rosenthal's measure and more when deciding 
how to split the 213 zone. The franchise areas of the two phone companies were 
a lesser consideration, he said. Two of the nine cities -- Bell Gardens and 
Commerce -- are split along franchise lines. 
</P>
<P>
The U-shaped 310 area, which borders downtown Los Angeles on three sides, made 
sense, Gomez said, because it kept within the 213 zone the communities most 
closely associated with the downtown area, such as Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A key technical consideration, he said, is that phone lines are connected to 
specific exchanges, or main offices. It is extremely difficult and expensive to 
route an existing line into a different exchange, said Gomez, adding that the 
310 zone represents a "sound, sincere business decision that impacted the least 
amount of people possible." 
</P>
<P>
A small sampling of customers showed that some are more concerned than others 
about the 310 split. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Bell Gardens bank that will be in a different area code from 
its principal customer said his business should be affected very little. 
</P>
<P>
"From a banking standpoint it might become an irritation, but that's called 
change," said manager James Lyle. "We're usually not an impulse call." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Last month, GTE California and Pacific Bell announced that the 213 area code in 
parts of Los Angeles County would be divided in two, with the creation of a new 
310 area code that forms a horseshoe shape around downtown Los Angeles. Under 
the change, effective in 1992, nine cities will be split in two, with each city 
partly in the 213 area and partly in the 310 area. The cities that would be 
split are Bell Gardens, Beverly Hills, Commerce, Culver City, Inglewood, 
Hawthorne, Lynwood, South Gate and West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
NEW AREA CODE BOUNDARIES 
</P>
<P>
Rough boundaries for 213 area code and the new 310 area code, as determined by 
GTE California and Pacific Bell, are based on existing telephone number

'DUMBTH' ARTICLE HITS CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Dumbth," (Times, Jan. 21) Steve Allen updates us on the demise of American 
smarts. I'm sure that we can all find examples in our daily lives of this 
serious and embarrassing cultural problem. 
</P>
<P>
The other night in a Westwood bar I was chatting with a professional woman in 
the financial field. It was just days after the U.S. intervention in Panama, 
and I asked her if she was disturbed by the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
She said yes, but then went on to say that she was more bothered by the fact 
that Noriega had been sending the letter bombs to the judges in Florida 
(confusing the situation with a completely unrelated story in Alabama). She 
must have had an extra drink when she read the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
And a UCLA journalism classmate, who happens to be from Switzerland, told me 
this week that she went shopping at Bullocks recently. She paid with her credit 
card from a Swiss bank. "Switzerland?" asked the teller, "what state is that 
in?" 
</P>
<P>
In a country that can produce the best basketball players in the world, put a 
TV in every home and put people into space, can't we do better in educating 
ourselves about the world? 
</P>
<P>
If not, what are we doing in Panama, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Or Florida, for that matter! And that's one I can't answer myself.

AIRPORT OFFICIALS REJECT PROPOSAL TO PUT SOLAR PLANT ON PALMDALE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles airport authorities said Wednesday they are not interested in a 
proposal by the world's largest producer of solar energy to build a major solar 
power plant on vacant land that Los Angeles owns in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Luz International of Westwood proposed to the Los Angeles Board of Airport 
Commissioners the construction of a $1-billion plant on some of the 17,500 
acres the Los Angeles Department of Airports owns in Palmdale. Luz already 
operates several large solar plants in nearby areas of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners took no formal action on Luz's proposal, but airport 
officials said in interviews later that they have little interest in the 
concept. The airport board still hopes to use much of its mostly vacant land in 
Palmdale for construction of an airport someday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think the sentiment is, a solar plant is not a revenue-producing 
thing and it could be located somewhere else," said Jerry Epstein, president of 
the airport board, after the panel heard a presentation by a Luz representative 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Luz has been trying to persuade the city of Los Angeles to 
finance the development of a city-owned solar plant that could meet almost 14% 
of the city's electrical needs. Los Angeles now gets none of its electricity 
from solar sources. 
</P>
<P>
The company proposed a plant that would produce up to 500 megawatts of the 
city's daily average electricity usage of about 3,500 megawatts. Such a plant 
could cost nearly $1 billion and require about 3,000 acres, a company spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is valuable for the city. And we think it offers tremendous 
environmental advantages," said Dennis Horgan, director of business development 
for Luz. He said solar energy can be a cost-effective alternative to oil- and 
coal-fired plants that increase air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The company already operates solar plants in the Mojave Desert communities of 
Daggett, Kramer Junction and Harper Lake, selling the electricity they produce 
to Southern California Edison. The company's newest plant in Harper Lake 
suffered an explosion and fire earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Horgan said his company suggested the Palmdale site because it is already owned 
by the city, is largely undeveloped and has the sunny weather needed for a 
solar plant. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said such a plant would interfere with plans for a future 
airport and do little to recoup the city's investment of nearly $100 million in 
the land, mostly acquired in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Palmdale solar plant proposal goes nowhere, Luz has already 
garnered support from Mayor Tom Bradley for pursuing the concept of a solar 
plant somewhere, said Bradley aide John Stodder. Luz intends to submit a 
proposal later this year when the city Department of Water and Power solicits 
ideas for new energy sources, Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, commercial air service resumed out of Palmdale after a 
five-year absence. The carrier, America West Airlines, flies out of the small 
Palmdale Air Terminal that Los Angeles built years ago. Los Angeles airport 
officials cannot say if or when the city might build a new airport on the 
thousands of acres it owns nearby.

CITIES' SUIT OVER PROP. 13 FUNDS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit challenging property tax distribution to cities in the wake of 
Proposition 13 has been dismissed by a Riverside Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last April by Compton, Temple City, El Segundo, Carson and 
Rancho Cucamonga, challenged the constitutionality of the current system, in 
which a city's share of property tax revenues are determined by pre-Proposition 
13 rates. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners charge that some cities unfairly benefit from the system 
because they had high tax rates on the books before Proposition 13 was passed 
in 1978, whereas cities that levied low property taxes, or none at all, lose 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Compton, for example, had a relatively low tax rate before Proposition 13 and 
Los Angeles had a much higher rate. That means that in 1986-87, Compton 
residents paid $14.9 million in property taxes but the city got back only $1.58 
million -- about 14 cents on the dollar. By comparison, Los Angeles got back 
about 36 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the cities said they would file a request for reconsideration. 
If the suit, which proposes a new revenue allocation formula, is ultimately 
successful, Compton could get as much as $1.4 million more a year in property 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Even cities that are not party to the suit could get more money. Under the 
proposed formula, Lakewood, for instance, would get as much as $3 million more 
a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities such as Long Beach and Los Angeles, however, would lose. In Long 
Beach's case, the loss could be around $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding against the cities, Judge John H. Barnard said in an opinion Jan. 
17 that the laws being attacked are constitutional and that the cities' 
"contention that the allocation scheme is unfair must be addressed to the 
(state) Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ken Gillanders of Temple City, which initiated the suit, said he 
wasn't surprised by the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we expected in the preliminary stages," he said. "This is 
ultimately going to be decided in (state) Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point attempting to resolve it with legislation," he added. "The 
big spenders are going to protect their sources of revenue. Let's face it, 
they've got more representatives in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Temple City is one of the biggest losers under the post-Proposition 13 
allocation formula. The city did not have a property tax at the time 
Proposition 13 passed, so, it does not get any revenues back now, even though 
its residents pay millions of dollars in property taxes every year. 
</P>
<P>
The current allocation system, said John Sturgeon, attorney for the cities, is 
a "completely arbitrary" formula. "It's a gross inequity," said City Manager 
Karl Koski of Temple City. "Our residents receive no benefit." 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners suggest that a fairer allocation method would rely on the total 
value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of tax revenue the 
city would receive. Under such a formula, Temple City would have gained about 
$1.46 million in revenues on the $7.5 million in property taxes its residents 
paid in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
About 33 of Los Angeles County's 85 cities either did not have a property tax 
or were not yet incorporated when Proposition 13 was passed, said Sam Olivito, 
executive director of the California Contract Cities Assn., which is supporting 
the suit. Pomona stands to lose more than any other city in the San Gabriel 
Valley under the proposed method, but Los Angeles, which had the county's 
highest property tax in 1978, would be hurt the most. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the suit are the counties of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, which 
have the responsibility of collecting and distributing the tax money to cities. 
Also named are the cities of Los Angeles and Redlands, which the petitioners 
charge are unfairly benefiting from the system. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court declined to hear the case without comment last March, 
and the suit was filed with the San Bernardino Superior Court in April. 
</P>
<P>
That court was selected because Rancho Cucamonga is the biggest loser in the 
current system. The case was transferred to Riverside after Redlands requested 
a change of venue to a neutral court.

ECHOES OF AN EMPIRE LINGER ON IN LAHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

LAHORE, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stranded in the middle of a busy intersection in downtown Lahore, where 
rickshaws and buses with men hanging off the back constantly jostle with cars 
for a piece of the road, the cast-iron-and-wood cannon, Zamzama, still looks 
ready for battle. 
</P>
<P>
The 232-year-old cannon changed hands among Afghan tribal chiefs, Sikh war 
lords and British artillerymen before coming to rest on the green roundabout. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the cannon's eventful history that makes it famous, however. The 
credit for this goes to Rudyard Kipling, who chose the cannon as the starting 
point for his novel "Kim." 
</P>
<P>
The book opens with a line describing Zamzama as "a fire-eating dragon" that 
"is always first of the conquerors' loot." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, "Kim" is partly an ode to Lahore, which Kipling fell in love with 
during his seven-year career at the Civil &amp; Military Gazette newspaper in 
the 1880s, when his father served as curator of the Lahore Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the fertile plains of Pakistan's portion of the Punjab, Lahore shares a 
common history and heritage with India and particularly its capital city, 
Delhi. But Lahore could be Delhi without the hassles: fewer beggars, 
panhandlers, money changers, fortune tellers and ear-cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
"Kim's Gun," as Zamzama is now called, also is a good place to begin a walking 
tour of Lahore, once a centerpiece of the Moghul empire and still regarded as 
one of the subcontinent's most beautiful cities. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may no longer enjoy the title of "Paris of the Orient," the former 
playground for the Moghul empire still boasts plenty of historic sites, a 
decent cultural schedule and enough interesting neighborhoods to keep a visitor 
busy for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Lahore is best viewed on foot, although its roads are packed with 
donkey carts, rickshaws, motorcycles, horse-drawn carriages and people. 
</P>
<P>
The cannon stands between the Lahore Museum and the University of Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-gallery museum offers a fascinating collection of works from 
2,400-year-old Buddhist sculptures to 19th-Century miniature paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, a photographic survey records the bloody battle that led to the 
creation of Pakistan in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The handsome red-brick museum, topped by a gorgeous dome, has not changed much 
since the British left Lahore. Even the fire extinguishers are veritable 
antiques left from the period of British rule. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is Punjab University's downtown campus, a complex of 
red-brick buildings worth walking through to reach Anarkali Bazaar, a crowded 
shopping area full of colorful clothing and craft stores. 
</P>
<P>
North of Anarkali is the Old City, a labyrinth of winding streets lined with 
endless bazaars, narrow houses and even brick barns full of livestock. The 
neighborhood is so battered that it looks as if it will collapse at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
Horse-and-buggies compete with cars and mechanical rickshaws. Children play 
barefoot in the streets and run up to strangers to shake their hands and ask, 
"Which country?" 
</P>
<P>
Above crowded streets fly seemingly unattended kites. Open-air restaurants 
serve hot, spicy food on soot-encrusted tables with sugar-loaded soft drinks or 
milk-sugar tea. 
</P>
<P>
Entire streets sell just a single type of product: copperware on one street, 
dishes on another; spices, pharmaceuticals, shoes, hats and carpets. 
</P>
<P>
On the northern edge of the Old City are three of Pakistan's most beloved 
monuments: the Badshahi Mosque, the Old Fort and Minar-e-Pakistan. Entrances to 
the enormous mosque and fort face each other like competitors -- one 
celebrating religion, the other war. 
</P>
<P>
The imposing 314-year-old mosque, built of red sandstone, has a gigantic 
courtyard with a marble fountain in the center. The four minarets that anchor 
the corners, each with 204 steps, are sometimes open and offer excellent views 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque is a legacy of the reign of the Moghul leader Aurangzeb, an Islamic 
fundamentalist who cruelly imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, for seven years 
in the Red Fort in Agra, India, where Jahan watched the construction of his 
greatest creation -- the Taj Mahal -- from a jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the mosque is the Tomb of Allama Muhammad Iqbal. The unimpressive 
little structure is dedicated to the poet and writer who argued for the 
creation of an Islamic state. 
</P>
<P>
More engaging is the Sikh marble pavilion, Hazuri Bagh Baradari, a graceful and 
elegant structure built between the fort and mosque by Ranjit Singh in 1818. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing quite prepares you for the Old Fort, however. The sprawling complex has 
gone through five transformations, three while under the control of the 
Moghuls, then two more while held by the Sikhs and, later, the British. 
</P>
<P>
The fort is broken up into three Moghul courts filled with gates, apartments, 
fountains, parks, elephant steps, open-air halls and two museums. 
</P>
<P>
Little restoration has been done on the fort. Akbar met his subjects from a 
balcony in the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audiences) that has deteriorated so 
much that a government guidebook admits the area "looks like an outhouse." 
That's amusing, but a bit much for one of the country's leading tourist sites. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the fort's gate is the ornate, gilt-domed tomb of Ranjit Singh, and 
more of the Old City. To the north stands the Minar-e-Pakistan, an unattractive 
tower commemorating the country's founding. 
</P>
<P>
More intriguing is the Wazir Khan mosque, full of elaborate and colorful 
calligraphy only a few blocks away from the fort in the Old City. 
</P>
<P>
The city's other two widely heralded sites are Jehangir's Tomb and Shalimar 
Gardens, both far from central Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
Built for the man who ruled India in the early 1600s, the tomb sits on spacious 
and well-kept grounds across the Ravi River from Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
The imposing tomb shares the area with two other tombs -- one for Jehangir's 
wife, Nur Jahan, the other for her brother, Asaf Khan. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Moghuls with a strong sense of symmetry and beauty, Shalimar 
Gardens showed significant signs of wear on my last visit, but it is still 
worth a trip. 
</P>
<P>
Much prettier is Jinnah's Garden, a botanical garden boasting the most 
beautiful library in the country. 
</P>
<P>
After a few days of walking, visitors may want to check out some of the local 
shops. Check the mall for shops selling crafts -- carpets, batiks, wooden 
boxes, wall hangings and needlepoint. Try Nicholson Road for one of the largest 
carpet markets in Pakistan. Look at Gulberg Market, southwest of downtown, for 
Western goods and pricey -- by Pakistani standards -- clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has little nightlife to offer, except for the occasional films, plays 
and poetry readings. Drinking is forbidden except at international hotels, and 
then only in rooms. 
</P>
<P>
As for accommodations, Lahore has two international-class hotels in the $45 to 
$150 range, the Pearl Continental and Hilton International. More moderate, $40 
or less, are the British Raj remnant, Faletti's (the city's most charming 
hotel), the International, Ambassador, Amer and Indus. Each of these hotels is 
on or near the mall. 
</P>
<P>
If you are planning to visit India, you can easily combine that with a trip to 
Pakistan. The advantage of flying into Delhi is that Lahore, Pakistan's major 
cultural and historical center, is only a 40-minute, $40 plane ride away. 
</P>
<P>
Lahore works as a good starting point from which to begin a tour of the 
country's major areas of interest, such as Peshawar, Swat Valley, Chitral and 
the Karakoram Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Direct flights into the country usually arrive in Karachi, a relatively new 
city that has suffered from constant ethnic unrest and without much to offer in 
the way of colorful markets or historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
Western women should dress modestly to avoid problems and might even consider 
buying a shalwar kameez, a loose-fitting garment as comfortable as pajamas, 
upon arrival in Pakistan. Considering the temperatures, which hit 120 degrees 
in May, and the frowns that a pair of shorts usually elicit, men may want to 
buy a shalwar kameez, too. 
</P>
<P>
Air travel between Pakistani cities is rarely more than $20. Even on short 
notice, seats are nearly always available. Flights to the northern cities of 
Gilgit and Skardu (home of K-2, the world's second-highest mountain) cost about 
$10 one way. 
</P>
<P>
On a short trip to the country, travelers can visit Karachi and Islamabad, a 
city of straight, clean streets and expensive homes not unlike the kind seen in 
an upscale Southern California neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities have museums and a handful of interesting sites, including the 
ancient ruins of Moenjodaro near Karachi and the Buddhist ruins of Taxila near 
Islamabad.

REPUBLICANS: GEORGE BUSH SURFBOARDS OVER ISSUES BUT DEMOCRATS COULD RIDE THE 
WAVES OF CHANGE -- ON TAXES, ABORTION AND TUSSLES IN WORLD TRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, George Bush has achieved record 70%-80% favorable poll ratings while 
surfboarding on international events and opportunities from Eastern Europe to 
Panama. Yet not a few Republicans worry that these glories are only a flimsy 
facade behind which important political dangers fester. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh reality is that few Presidents have made a success out of four years 
without a significant national agenda, and Bush's domestic policy -- unless 
bold blueprints for Wednesday's State of the Union address have been cleverly 
hidden -- is the strategic equivalent of a nudist colony. The political 
dilemma, bluntly put, is that even if the President can keep his personal 
ratings reasonably high, long-term ideological trends are going soft. 
</P>
<P>
Three especially dangerous waves for the Administration and the GOP already 
begin to surge: a rising libertarianism on abortion, a new Social 
Security-related tax revolt in Middle America and indications that economic 
nationalism could replace Caribbean gunboat diplomacy as the voter-desired 
jingoism of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
All three developments, moreover, involve major GOP intraparty policy conflicts 
and strike at underlying cultural, economic and patriotic pillars of the 
Republic presidential majority that began taking shape more than two decades 
ago. These changes cannot be staved off with happy talk or clever tactics; they 
represent something more profound: the increasing obsolescence and exhaustion 
of yesteryear's fine-for-1973 and good-for-1981 GOP national-policy solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion, of course, keynotes the cultural turnabout. Along with support for 
the death penalty and opposition to school busing, right-to-life commitment 
became a bold banner of late 1970s conservatism. After the U.S. Supreme Court 
legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, conservative politicians 
and national GOP platforms could posture for right-to-life backers -- and did 
-- while the party's pro-choice upper-class professionals and career women 
yawned. Opposition to abortion became one of three or four cultural issues 
shaping new Republican voting patterns from Catholic South Boston to Baptist 
North Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1989, that is. By reopening abortion to state-level decision-making, the 
Supreme Court Webster ruling drove a legal wedge into the conservative 
coalition that united Tennessee fundamentalists with suburban Planned 
Parenthood voters. As of 1990, GOP gubernatorial contenders are fighting 
fierce, divisive primaries over abortion in key states from Massachusetts to 
Texas. Church-going true-believers and upper-bracket sophisticates -- at each 
other's sides during the 1980s -- are now at each other's throats. The close 
collaboration of conservative politics and religion, begun in the 1970s, now 
seems in decline. Jerry Falwell has had to demobilize his Moral Majority and 
homosexual Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) may even win reelection in suburban 
Massachusetts, despite letting a male prostitute operate out of his Washington 
apartment. For the first time since 1964, cultural issues have begun to divide 
Republicans as much as Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, staunch conservatives and Republicans cemented a 1980s 
hold on Middle America by suppressing inflation and cutting taxes, two 
achievements now in some dispute. Inflation shows periodic signs of heating up 
again, and a New York Democrat has an electrifying proposal to cut Social 
Security taxes by $55 billion next year: Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has 
launched a debate that could wind up educating and even embittering voters over 
who got the tax cuts of the 1980s and who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, Middle America got the speeches; upper America got the bucks. 
For most families, the big tax changes of the 1980s didn't come in modest 
federal income-tax cuts -- they came in a Social Security tax rate surging from 
5.8% in 1980 to 7.65% in 1990, while the income base it applied to doubled from 
$25,900 to $51,300. A family with one-breadwinner income constant at $50,000 
during that period would have seen its Social Security burden swell from $1,500 
a year to $3,800. Some "tax-cut decade." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, the top tax bracket for millionaires did come down from 70% 
in 1981 to 28% in 1988, setting up a stunning comparison. Consider a family 
with husband-and-wife breadwinners each making $50,000 a year in salary. For 
income taxes, their combined salaries put them in the 33% rate 
upper-middle-class "bubble," and both their incomes are fully taxable for 
Social Security at 7.65%. That means a combined federal marginal tax rate of 
41%, far above the marginal tax rate of 28% paid by billionaires like David 
Rockefeller or Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, income and wealth shifted upward. Congressional Budget Office 
numbers show 7.2% of total national income in the hands of the top 1% of 
Americans back in 1977; now that same top 1% will have 11.4% of the 1990 total. 
Should this comparison arouse middle-class voters, the Republicans could lose 
their 1980s position as the party of tax cuts -- and regain their old New 
Deal-era opprobrium as the party principally loyal to the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Tricky transition No. 3 involves foreign policy. Republicans can no longer 
count on the "we're better at dealing with the Soviets" argument, despite its 
important GOP vote-getting role since the Eisenhower-Nixon years. Public 
opinion's new preoccupation, by a large majority, is to consider U.S. interests 
more gravely threatened by Japanese economic, financial and trade strength -- 
brought to critical mass by policy miscues under Ronald Reagan -- than by any 
military threat from Moscow. And this same psychology lays out the new 
international playing field where American voters want a game plan to recover 
the U.S. economic clout and wealth lost to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
With two recent polls showing 60%-70% of Americans glooming that Japan has 
already overtaken the United States as the world's leading economic power, 
1990s politics are bound to be affected. After the United States was defeated 
in Vietnam 15 years ago, frustrated American voters slowly but surely embraced 
military and diplomatic nationalism -- even jingoism -- over the Panama Canal 
treaties in 1977, the Iranian seizure of U.S. Embassy personnel as hostages in 
1980. The public applauded the invasion of Grenada in 1983, the air-strike 
against Tripoli in 1986 and the recent invasion of Panama. Each machismo 
episode underscored Democratic weakness or GOP strength -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, as voter concern refocuses on the United States' increasing 
commercial and financial displacement by Japan -- cumulatively a more important 
defeat than Vietnam -- electoral results may reflect that same frustration. And 
if tough talk on trade and money starts replacing military saber-rattling, 
domestic politics would change, too. The applause for air strikes and Caribbean 
invasions once epitomized a popular reaction against long-standing Democartic 
weaknesses and liberal inability to apply military power. Economic nationalism, 
by contrast, would draw on voter disenchantment with the Reagan-Bush era 
slippage caused by White House unwillingness to apply economic power or to 
interfere with market forces in behalf of protecting U.S. national interests. 
</P>
<P>
All three situations could -- none of this is yet certain -- signal a 
metamorphosis of Republican-tilted issues and popular frustrations into 
pro-Democratic circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The longer the Republicans control the presidency, after all, the more 
troubling situations and national difficulties will have developed when the GOP 
held the nation's helm. Even Democrats will begin to see more and more 
opportunities for criticism and attack. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, as his high ratings bear witness, Bush is successfully managing 
the transformation -- in part by ignoring it, and in part by playing a string 
of yesterday's trumps. He has used gunboat diplomacy, anti-crime rhetoric and 
drug-control bombast. But they will not be enough. The real test -- first, in 
Bush's Wednesday State of the Union message, and then in his follow-up actions 
-- is whether the President can seriously address three incipient mood-shifts 
and role-reversals that threaten to rescript U.S. politics and ideology in the 
1990s.

L.A. ELECTION RETURNS: COSTS UP, CONFIDENCE DOWN, APATHY ALL OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Warren Christopher, Warren Christopher is the chairman of O'Melveny &amp; 
Myers and a member of the California Commission on Campaign Financing, a 
nonprofit research organization that published a major 1989 report on Los 
Angeles campaign financing: Money and Politics in the Golden State: Financing 
California's Local Elections. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The citizens of Los Angeles should be deeply disappointed that the Los Angeles 
City Council, in a sadly confused and self-indulgent session, stripped campaign 
financing reform from the ethics package it voted to place before the voters. 
Drafted by the Citizens Ethics Commission after nine months of careful 
research, the proposed reforms were designed to be the finest, most 
far-reaching campaign laws in the country. Now, unless the council corrects its 
omission, a citizen-backed initiative will be necessary to put this whole issue 
before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
It is not too late for the council to recognize that campaign reforms are an 
essential part of any ethics-reform package. To try addressing the fundamental 
problems of citizen apathy and official misconduct without campaign reform 
would be as foolish as trying to control wages without prices. 
</P>
<P>
All of us are aware of a growing disenchantment with institutions of 
government. Public-opinion polls report a disturbing loss of confidence in 
elected officials. Voters avoid the ballot box in increasing numbers; only 23% 
of the Los Angeles electorate came to the polls in the 1989 mayoral election. 
And many talented individuals, deterred by the need for huge campaign funds, 
are reluctantly choosing career paths that will lead them away from valuable 
service in local government. 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe today, we are watching whole democracies created almost 
overnight as the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, 
Bulgaria and Romania struggle to shape new forms of government that will 
reflect the true interests of their peoples. Surely we can do no less than 
re-examine our own government to make those improvements that will strengthen 
the democratic processes here at home. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Los Angeles political candidates have been forced to raise 
larger and larger sums of money for political survival. Between 1980 and 1985, 
City Council candidates spent an average of $15.09 per vote -- one of the 
highest local spending-per-vote ratios in the state -- and the cost continues 
to increase. This escalation has forced candidates to allot more time for 
raising money and less time addressing important, substantial issues. The 
pressures to raise money have created the appearance -- justified or not -- 
that candidates and officials are more influenced by major contributors than by 
the interests of the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
Truly effective campaign reforms require a combination of remedies, including 
expenditure ceilings, contribution limits and limited public-matching funds. 
This comprehensive approach has been successfully tested at local elections in 
Seattle, Tucson and Sacramento County. A number of states -- Wisconsin, 
Minnesota, Michigan and New Jersey -- have also adopted this approach and it 
has been successfully used in Presidential elections for 12 years. It decreases 
the time candidates spend on fund-raising, diminishes the perception that 
candidates are unduly beholden to large contributors, encourages new candidates 
to run for local office and helps restore public confidence in local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, limits on contributions alone -- which is all Los Angeles has at 
the moment -- have been shown not to work. Local California jurisdictions with 
only contribution limits have seen soaring campaign costs, diminished 
competition and continued allegations of excessive contributor-influence. In 
San Francisco, for example, the voters dropped the contribution ceiling from 
$1,000 to $500, hoping to reduce excessive campaign spending. Yet in the first 
election under the lower limits, three mayoral candidates each broke the $1 
million-spending mark for the first time in city history. Sacramento and San 
Diego have also imposed strict contribution limits, only to see spending 
continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Ceilings on the amount spent in city races are essential to effective campaign 
reform. The expenditure ceilings proposed for Los Angeles are realistic -- and 
far from too restrictive. They would permit $400,000 to be spent, for example, 
in a council primary and $400,000 if there is a council runoff election 
campaign. Yet, they would go far toward checking the out-of-control escalation 
in campaign costs. 
</P>
<P>
Every elected official I know is devastated, almost on a daily basis, by the 
amount of time that must be allocated to raising money. In major races, we are 
on the verge of campaigns focused exclusively on fund-raising and trips to the 
television studio. It is difficult to imagine a greater derogation of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Limited public-matching funds are an essential component of comprehensive 
campaign reforms, in large part because they are a constitutionally required 
predicate to expenditure ceilings. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that 
expenditure ceilings cannot be imposed unless candidates agree to them in 
exchange for matching funds. Matching funds also ease the fund-raising 
pressures on candidates. More, they encourage newcomers to enter politics, to 
try their hand at elective office. 
</P>
<P>
The matching-funds proposal presented to the council was more sophisticated 
than any in the country. Candidates would qualify for matching funds only if 
they raise qualifying amounts in private contributions, agree to debates and 
have an opponent who qualifies for matching funds. Hence, public funds would 
only go to truly serious candidates and costs would be kept as low as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle has the longest experience of any local jurisdiction with public aid to 
candidates. The city implemented a campaign-finance ordinance with expenditure 
ceilings and public financing in 1979 and 1981. Then Seattle let it lapse for 
three years, re-enacting it in 1984. A study of the elections held -- under the 
new law and without it -- found that the ordinance successfully increased the 
number of small contributions, diminished the number of large contributions, 
limited spending and encouraged more candidates -- including women and 
minorities -- to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
Cost estimates of the Los Angeles matching-funds proposal have been inflated 
well beyond what will reasonably be spent. The best calculation among 
independent experts who closely follow city politics is that the matching funds 
provisions will cost taxpayers no more than $3 million a year (and more likely, 
only a fraction of that amount). This would be a highly prudent investment to 
help purify campaigns and reduce the outrageous costs and fund-raising that are 
now the norm. 
</P>
<P>
The council should have placed this financing question before the voters. Now, 
unless our local representatives reverse themselves, the only alternative is 
the initiative route. Those who circulate such an initiative should examine 
amendments the council made to the original proposal and incorporate those 
which make sense. But they also should make the initiative as tough and fair as 
possible for all candidates -- incumbents and challengers alike. 
</P>
<P>
If ultimately adopted by voters, the new comprehensive package of campaign law 
would place Los Angeles in the national forefront of reform efforts. It would 
give residents a much-needed sense of confidence that city government and city 
campaigns will operate under the highest ethical standards in the nation.

SPRAYING FOR MEDFLIES, STIRRING UP A BACKLASH; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: MALATHION MAY BE A 'SAFE' INSECTICIDE, BUT DOUSING BY HELICOPTER 
ISN'T WHAT IT WAS INTENDED FOR AND HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATELY STUDIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Nichols, Mary Nichols is a senior attorney for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official notice is shoved through the mail slot or tucked under the 
windshield wiper. In English and Spanish, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the Office of the County 
Agricultural Commissioner announce: "An aerial application of malathion protein 
bait is necessary in your area, due to the presence of the Mediterranean fruit 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
The next night, helicopter bombardment begins. And it continues, sometimes as 
often as 12 times in a single neighborhood. To many, this is just another 
oddity of life in a semiarid tropical paradise; cover the fishpond, hose down 
the lemon tree, a quick trip to the carwash next morning and it's all over. But 
for a growing number of grumpy urban villagers, sticky chemical rain is one 
assault they don't want to put up with. Who cares about the Medfly, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously federal, state and county agriculture officials care plenty. They are 
willing to subject a widening area, populated by millions of citizens whose 
only relationship to agricultural production may be a back-yard kumquat, to 
wholesale aerial spraying. Malathion, the pesticide of choice, kills many 
beneficial insects as well as Medflies. The sole purpose is to prevent the 
flies from marching inexorably toward Modesto -- from an agricultural point of 
view, it is cheaper to spray most of Los Angeles and Orange counties for a year 
than to spray or treat produce from the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The price of spraying malathion over the largest population center in 
California may be considerably more than helicopter rental and chemicals, 
however. As the Medfly war drags on, without apparent victories and over an 
increasingly larger battlefield, questions are being raised about the whole 
approach to agricultural pest management in the nation's largest 
produce-exporting state. These questions pit some (though by no means all) 
California agribusinesses -- and the chemical industry that services them -- 
against consumers and farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion, ironically, is probably the safest pesticide in use today. As the 
official notice says, it is used by many home gardeners. But those gardeners 
spray malathion directly on insect-infested plants, not over whole 
neighborhoods -- swimming pools, toddler's tricycles and all. Perhaps most 
important, the home gardener is not spraying from helicopters in the dark. For 
many Southern Californians -- including refugees from real war zones, as well 
as those whose neighborhoods are sometimes policed by air -- the sound of 
helicopters at night is a cause for genuine alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that malathion is relatively innocuous compared with other chemicals 
currently in use and that government agencies have proclaimed it safe does not 
mean the end of the health and safety debate. No scientific studies or public 
hearings have been conducted to support the safety of general spraying of 
malathion over urban areas. Even assuming that current official assessments of 
risk are correct, even a very small risk of neurological damage is magnified by 
the very large numbers of people exposed. The finding of no significant risk is 
only applicable to uses of the pesticide for which it is registered -- i.e., 
ground application on selected crops that are washed before they are consumed. 
</P>
<P>
After the public controversy aroused by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr.'s intervention in the 1982 California Medfly infestation died down, the 
state Department of Health Services did gather data on birth defects. Not 
surprisingly, in a short-term study the researchers failed to find a link 
between spraying malathion and harm to fetuses. Other, more subtle health 
effects were never studied simply because studies cost money and the state 
chose to put its limited health-research dollars elsewhere once public 
attention wandered off the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for 
manufacturers of malathion to provide more health data to support 
re-registration of the insecticide. The agency refuses to make its data public 
despite public requests sparked by rumors that a new study establishes a link 
between malathion and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has chosen to evade the current controversy by claiming its studies are 
part of internal decision-making, therefore exempt from the Freedom of 
Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by concerned residents, several cities including Los Angeles are now 
holding hearings and threatening legislation to halt the spraying. State Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) last week introduced a bill to ban aerial spraying 
pending further health studies. Meanwhile, spraying continues, set through 
summer. The longer it continues, the more impetus it provides for a more 
sweeping solution -- "Big Green" -- than either lawsuits or the Torres bill 
would offer. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green is the environmental-protection limitation initiative of 1990, a 
comprehensive measure now being circulated for the November ballot by a 
coalition that includes major environmental organizations, elected officials 
and such political groups as the California League of Conservation Voters. 
Among other reforms, the initiative would take control of the registration of 
pesticides away from agriculture officials and put it in the hands of the 
Department of Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
Losing control of the registration process is the threat the chemical industry 
fears most; the trade association of agricultural pesticide manufacturers is 
already gearing up its own counterinitiative to draw votes away. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly may have flown away as an issue by then, but the sound of 
helicopters and the smell of sticky malathion bait will still be fresh in the 
minds of many big-city voters. 
</P>
<P>
California's pesticide industry may win the current battle but it is now at 
greater risk of losing the war.

A NEW DAY DAWNS FOR RAIL TRANSPORT AS THE HIGHWAY LOBBY CLIMBS ABOARD;

<TEXT>
<P>
John Geoghegan, the Deukmejian Administration secretary of business, 
transportation and housing, recalls the time in the 1960s when he was a city 
manager in Alameda County trying to promote funds for mass transit: 
</P>
<P>
"I used to attend meetings of the highway-users conference. Any time someone 
brought up the subject of gas-tax money for transit purposes, most of the 
people in the room would bristle. Money for transit had to come out of the fare 
box, period. What's happening today would have been considered heresy. Those in 
the so-called highway Establishment now realize that they have to subsidize 
transit." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, a dramatic change in thinking has risen among general 
contractors, oil companies, truckers, auto clubs and others who move the 
freeway lobby in California. Rail is no longer a dirty word. Trains and 
trolleys, along with buses, are viewed as an ally in the fight against 
congestion and smog. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning and Conservation League has qualified a $2-billion rail-bond issue 
for the June ballot by initiative -- and there is as yet no organized 
opposition to the plan designed to promote development of a European-style 
intercity rail system in California. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Senate Constitutional Amendment 1, the $18.5-billion 
transportation package to be placed on the June ballot by Gov. George 
Deukmejian and the Legislature, authorizes for the first time a diversion of 
gasoline-tax funds to mass transit. In addition to a $1-billion bond issue for 
transit, another $8 billion could be used for bus or rail lines at local and 
state option. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-rail slant of SCA 1 represents a major shift in attitude by Deukmejian, 
who came into office proposing that the state halt support for intercity rail 
service failing to meet specified fare-box tests. Just four years ago, the 
Administration was still operating on the theory that gridlock wasn't a big 
enough threat to warrant massive state intervention. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration's transportation policies went through a transformation 
in Deukmejian's second term. The governor saw that the state couldn't build 
enough roadways to beat congestion. County after county voted to increase the 
sales tax to provide more money for both highways and transit expansion. Amtrak 
trains started running at capacity. New trolley systems were built in San 
Diego, San Jose and Sacramento, and construction on a backbone system was 
started in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
When the World Series earthquake struck the Bay Area, the freeway system failed 
but BART trains kept running. Rail advocates claim that the state needs to 
build more "redundancy" into its transportation network to prepare for such 
emergencies and to fight gridlock and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show the public is willing to spend money for transit facilities; the 
city of Sacramento is even considering the levy of a tax to support its bus and 
light-rail system. County sales-tax increases have generally been successful 
only when the proceeds are earmarked for both transit and highway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Most of California's transit-development activity has happened at the local 
level over the past two decades, with some financial support from the federal 
government. The entry of the state into the transit picture is quite recent. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., who left office in 1966, was the last governor to 
push a major transportation program. His successors, Ronald Reagan and Edmund 
G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., made no effort to increase funds available for the 
building of freeways, let alone rail lines. State highway construction funds 
were earmarked largely for completion of interstate highways financed heavily 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
With gridlock approaching and the smog problem unresolved, Deukmejian found 
himself under heavy pressure to increase gasoline taxes for highway 
construction. Until last year, he resisted, preferring to see counties raise 
sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, Deukmejian saw the need for a major transportation initiative, 
and he attempted to develop a consensus on a ballot proposal. When the dust 
settled, transit for the first time in recent state history was recognized as a 
legitimate partner for highways, even by those in the so-called freeway lobby. 
</P>
<P>
There were economic reasons. As Gerald H. Meral, executive director of the 
Planning and Conservation League, points out, "The entire Sacramento light-rail 
system was built for less than the cost of a single proposed freeway 
interchange in Walnut Creek -- a Riverside-Orange County commuter rail line 
would be even cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for the breakthrough was a fundamental change in the 
political dynamics of transportation. The pro-freeway forces became so 
frustrated about getting nothing that they were willing to abandon their 
stranglehold on all gas-tax proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The California Trucking Assn. was faced with a proposed ban on daytime truck 
operations in the heart of Los Angeles. The association started to see transit 
as an ally in preserving freedom of movement. The general contractors wanted 
transportation business, and they no longer cared what form it took. "Anything 
is better than nothing," observed Roy Heatly of the Construction Awareness 
Program. "Political reality has set in." 
</P>
<P>
A generational transition also took shape during the years when all was 
relatively quiet on the transportation front. Old highway Establishment 
die-hards retired. Their replacements didn't have their feet so deeply buried 
in concrete on funds for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Nida, vice president and general counsel for the Automobile Club of 
Southern California, spans both generations. He says there is still a reservoir 
of thinking that gasoline-tax funds should never be diverted to transit. "But 
that issue isn't at the fighting edge. The old highway and transit lobbies 
don't exist any more," he said. "Maybe if there are no big fights, values 
change. There are overwhelming needs. We need everything -- and more." 
Deukmejian and other sponsors of the June ballot package, which includes a 
9-cents-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, have been attempting to 
neutralize opposition among groups as diverse as land developers and the 
California Teachers Assn. But none of the opposition has dealt with perhaps the 
most significant implication of this year's vote -- the inauguration of a true 
partnership for rail in the state's transportation future. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve the entire program, including two bond issues for transit, 
the state will be committed to connecting all California urban centers with 
frequent rail service roughly comparable with the Amtrak line now running 
between Los Angeles and San Diego. In addition, a huge new source of funds will 
be made available for the expansion of train and bus service throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, it would have been ridiculous to suggest that such a plan 
would be presented to the voters with the support of the highway Establishment. 
But things are different now.

TAX CUT: THE GOP SHOULD LEAP AT MOYNIHAN'S ORPHANED PROPOSAL, AND ADD A FEW 
OFITS OWN TO BRING THE REAGAN REVOLUTION TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

<TEXT>
<P>
While one is hesitant to hand out advice to a President "rocking along" at 80% 
public approval, George Bush is making a terrible mistake not seizing on Pat 
Moynihan's Social Security tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest fish of the year, a whopper, is sitting right in front of his boat. 
All Bush has to do is gaff it, grab this $55-billion tax cut, add on his own 
popular capital-gains tax cut, attach Lloyd Bentsen's IRA proposal, rechristen 
the package, "Peace Dividend," and make it his first priority on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Congress could not resist. Liberals and conservatives would be scrambling to 
endorse. The GOP's best issue -- they are the party of taxes; we, the party of 
tax cuts -- would be driven home to those working- and middle-class Americans 
who missed out on the Reagan Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
A Social Security tax cut is an engraved invitation to the Bush Party of the 
'90s, for all who did not get in on the Reagan Party of the '80s. Here is a way 
to reach black America that does not alienate white America. 
</P>
<P>
When the Peace Dividend passed, every worker in the nation could be sent a 
message just before November's election: "Beginning Jan. 1, your paycheck will 
be increased by X amount of dollars." Signed, George Bush. For working couples, 
the increase in take-home pay could run to $1,000 a year. Every investor could 
be told in a national address: Hold your assets until Jan. 1, then, take those 
capital gains and reinvest. 
</P>
<P>
Making this tax cut the altarpiece of the Bush program will shove onto the back 
burner the entire Democratic social agenda. The Dodd day-care bill could be 
shunted onto a side track, with the argument that, with this tax cut, we are 
giving working parents both the money and the freedom to choose what kind of 
day care they prefer. Tax cuts are a win-win proposition for the GOP. How can 
the party of the people lose a bidding war where the winner is one who cuts 
deeper into the diet of Big Government? 
</P>
<P>
Budget Director Richard Darman calls the Moynihan tax cut the "most 
irresponsible idea of the '90s," a "grenade . . . thrown into the middle of the 
House and Senate." From the paralyzed reaction of Speaker Tom Foley and Senate 
Leader George Mitchell, however, the only thing wrong with that grenade is that 
it was not a cluster bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Has anybody seen Jack Kemp? Ten years ago, he, Bill Steiger and Bill Roth in 
the Senate led the GOP in proposing a tax cut in the teeth of Jimmy Carter's 
deficits. Seized upon by Ronald Reagan, that idea helped lead to the 
Conservative Decade of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that tax cuts cause deficits, but deficits did not harm the party 
in '84 or '88. And deficits have benefits: First, they converted the Democrats, 
rhetorically at least, to the theology of balanced budgets; second, they killed 
all enthusiasm for new social spending. The only major social program enacted 
in the Reagan Decade was catastrophic health insurance, later repealed. The 
GOP's strategic deficit has given the Big Spenders a 10-year cold shower. 
</P>
<P>
To borrow the title of Edgar Allen Poe's short story, tax cuts, combined with 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets, are The Pit and the Pendulum of the 
Great Society, an infernal machine for down-sizing the welfare state and 
defunding the left. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of tax cuts and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, federal spending has 
fallen from 24% of gross national product to 21% in the coming fiscal year, 
while revenues, thanks to Ronald Reagan, still take 19%. If the GOP can cut 
revenues back to 18%, spending must fall to 20% of GNP, then 19%, then, 18%. 
Why would the party of Bob Taft oppose that? 
</P>
<P>
Does Gramm-Rudman-Hollings hit defense spending too hard? Yes, but the 
President can use the bully pulpit, and supplemental appropriations, to keep 
defense strong, and force Democrats to pay the price of selling out national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
There are vast areas of government that need a sharp knife: foreign aid and 
farm subsidies (which totaled $105 billion in the last five years), and aid to 
the cities. Indeed, why do Republican Presidents run deficits to send tens of 
billions to cities led by Democratic mayors? Why should GOP Administrations 
subsidize the subways of Mayors David Dinkins and Marion Barry? A rollback of 
urban spending would force governors and mayors to cut their own spending (and 
take the heat), or raise local taxes (and take the heat). Considering the 
plight of the Little Duke in Taxachussetts, the budget crisis of Mario Cuomo in 
New York, can not Republicans see that, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in place, 
tax cuts are an automatic formula for rolling back the Great Society and 
capturing all the heights of national politics? 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the Republican Party of Gerald Ford could not see the benefits 
of tax cuts. If the party of President Bush cannot see the merit of seizing on 
the Moynihan bill, of making tax cuts the GOP agenda of the '90s, then 
conservatives must show the way, as they did a decade ago.

POLITICS: THE RACE FOR STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER SETS OFF INFIGHTING WITHIN 
CONSUMERIST CIRCLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Scott, Joe Scott is a Los Angeles political journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who's the purest consumer advocate in the land? 
</P>
<P>
That's how Harvey Rosenfield, Voter Revolt chairman, wants to cast the race for 
the state's first elected insurance commissioner, judging by a memo he wrote. 
Purity concerns may also be behind Bill Press' decision to stop his commentary 
on television and radio and begin running full-time for commissioner. Tomorrow 
is his last day on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's internal memo to Voter Revolt staffers makes the case for state 
Board of Equalization member Conway Collis to be insurance commissioner. 
Collis, the memo argues, is the only candidate with a "commitment" to defend 
Proposition 103, the successful insurance-reform measure authored by 
Rosenfield. Many Voter Revolt staffers are expected to take leaves of absence 
to campaign for Collis. 
</P>
<P>
Then the memo moves on to examine the consumer-advocacy credentials of Press 
and Walter Zelman, executive director of Common Cause and also candidate for 
insurance commissioner. Rosenfield reminds his readers that neither Press nor 
Zelman supports the 103 enforcement initiative that Voter Revolt is trying to 
qualify for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Press gets a backslap for backing Proposition 103, though he came late to the 
cause. He's faulted for lacking experience on insurance issues. He's chastised 
for reportedly trying to parlay his support for Proposition 100 into 
trial-lawyer backing for his candidacy. The trial lawyers were the chief 
proponents of that losing measure. Press' campaign manager, Rick Taylor, calls 
the charge "hearsay." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's memo is far more critical of Zelman. The Common Cause director is 
accused of attempting to derail Proposition 103 before eventually backing it. 
Most galling to Rosenfield is Zelman's claim of responsibility for originally 
drafting 103 -- and for calling himself the California equivalent of consumer 
icon Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Zelman has said that Rosenfield has "exaggerated" his previous 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Will California be the site of the 1992 Republican National Convention? The 
last time Republicans came West was in 1964, when they nominated Barry 
Goldwater for President at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and San Francisco are among the California 
cities being mailed convention specifications this week. Scouts for the 
Republican National Committee have already visited the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has the final say in where 
the convention will be held. But helping the state's chances is an emerging 
electoral fact. California's electoral votes are no longer available for 
Republican taking. George Bush barely carried the state in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
State GOP Chairman Frank Visco favors San Diego because of its mild August 
climate. But convention scheduling conflicts could hurt the city's chances. 
</P>
<P>
The California Teachers Assn. appears ready to drop its threat to remain 
neutral or oppose Senate Constitutional Amendment 1. The measure, which will be 
on the June ballot, would hike the state gas tax and raise the Gann spending 
limit. The revenue would be used to upgrade the state's transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
California's most powerful teachers' group has criticized the measure because 
it lacks a firm guarantee that the public schools will continue to get their 
share of the budget as specified in Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
But after closed-door meetings with Mike Frost, Gov. George Deukmejian's chief 
of staff, and legislative leaders, the CTA's president, Ed Foglia, said that 
"things are moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
But Foglia still wants some solid guarantees, among them that the ballot 
argument favoring the constitutional amendment include language that the 
schools would not lose gains won in Proposition 98.

DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are other things to be said about the death penalty and Harris that The 
Times failed to weigh in its scales: 
</P>
<P>
* 45 more years of life for Harris means 45 years of risk for prison guards, 
other inmates, and anyone else who crosses his path if he escapes or is let go. 
</P>
<P>
* Every day that Harris lives will be a fresh day of anguish for the families 
of the boys he killed. 
</P>
<P>
He will never stop trying to get out. There will always be sympathizers to 
plead his case. There will be no peace or certainty for the living victims he 
left behind until the day that Harris is dead. 
</P>
<P>
* Life in prison isn't much of a punishment compared to what murder victims 
suffer. There are pleasures in prison: food, books, television, the 
companionship of others. These are things that he took forever from the boys he 
killed. They will be made available to him for the rest of his life, at public 
expense. He will be fed, clothed, tended to if sick, and protected from harm 
until he dies, at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
The Times sees injustice in the taking of Harris' life. I see injustice in the 
sparing of it.

DRAGON IN OUR OWN BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one except the most hopeless Democratic partisan will be happy if President 
Bush's war on drugs, escalated this week by the President to the tune of a 
$10.6 billion program, turns out to be a flop. But no one will be particularly 
surprised. While Bush proposes some new money, he is mainly relying on old 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The federal emphasis on law enforcement will remain -- with a bundle of new 
money for the military to get involved against traffickers. The basic formula 
of 70% for law enforcement and 30% for drug treatment and education will not be 
tampered with. This means that the war on drugs will be fought as if it were a 
conventional war. So it's impossible not to fear an end result similar to other 
wars where Washington has tried and failed to employ conventional methods 
against an unconventional enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The sincerity of the President's abomination of the drug plague is not in 
doubt: Drugs ruin family life and erode the fabric of society. The President's 
drug czar, William Bennett, has brought a great deal of welcome energy to the 
problem. But not even the best of intentions and Olympian bolts of energy will 
matter in the end if the plan is fundamentally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that cocaine-exporting countries like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru need 
to be helped to crack down on their exporters, and the Bush program is very 
good on that score. It's true that drug centers like Los Angeles, Miami, New 
York and Houston need more federal money, as the Bush program plans to provide. 
It's also true that the Bush Administration is not oblivious to the need to 
deal with the demand side of the drug problem -- the huge national craving for 
narcotics without which the drug problem would scarcely exist. The plan calls 
for an intensification of drug-treatment programs in prisons (a very good idea) 
and pilot programs for drug-treatment campuses where addicts would be able to 
choose from an array of programs (another very good idea). 
</P>
<P>
What's missing is the understanding that the main cause of the drug problem is 
America's appetite for drugs. American buyers provide the market for the 
product; without this relentless demand, the problem would scarcely exist at 
its current magnitude. To make a dent in the economics of this billion-dollar 
trafficking, the country needs to make a dent in its own voracious demand for 
dope. The U.S. military could firebomb one exporting Third World nation after 
the other back into the Stone Age and still miss the target here at home: The 
U.S. market is so lucrative that other nations would want to rush in to pick up 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
There's some evidence that demand may be cooling a bit in the United States. 
This is why the Bush drug plan would be better advised to alter the 
law-enforcement (supply)/treatment-education (demand) expenditure formula from 
70/30 to 50/50 as rapidly as possible. What will ultimately slay the nation's 
addiction dragon are steady increases in the number of people who swear off 
drugs entirely and decreases in the quantities that the remaining users 
consume.

SECOND-CLASS WATER, FIRST CLASS IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of gallons of water are literally washed down the drain and out to sea 
in California every day -- in a California that is desperately short of water. 
This wasted water is being recaptured, recycled and reclaimed -- in relatively 
small amounts -- so that it can be used again. 
</P>
<P>
The California Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian now have an opportunity 
to encourage the large-scale reuse of treated sewage and other waste water by 
approving a proposed $200-million bond issue for the 1990 election ballot. This 
rather modest down payment, if approved by voters, will pay significant 
dividends over the next 20 years in the form of greater water security for the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing new about using reclaimed water. Treated sewage effluent has 
been used for landscape irrigation in Southern California since the 1920s. But 
only now is reclaimed waste water being viewed as a significant supply of "new" 
water that can offset the shortages that face California. The California Assn. 
of Reclamation Entities of Water says that proposed projects could generate 
nearly 700,000 acre-feet of water a year if all were built. That amount would 
meet the needs of nearly 3 million Californians annually. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, reclaimed water is not intended for in-home consumption. The water 
may be safe to drink, but health codes limit its use. Still, every gallon of 
reclaimed water put to use watering a golf course or a park frees up a gallon 
of drinkable water for homes, businesses and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Several far-sighted sanitation districts already have active reclamation 
projects. The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County generate up to 
60,000 acre-feet a year for replenishment of ground-water aquifers. The Irvine 
Ranch Water District in Orange County, a water reclamation pioneer, now is 
experimenting with dual piping systems that will allow reclaimed water to be 
used in toilets in new office buildings. An estimated 13% of San Diego County's 
supply is expected to come from reclaimed water within 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
There is a ready supply available: the output of public sewage-treatment 
plants. But putting reclaimed water to use is costly. The most highly treated 
effluent has the broadest application -- clean enough, for instance, to be 
sprayed directly onto food crops. This degree of treatment requires expensive 
facilities. Building the separate piping system is costly, too. The proposed 
bond measure, establishing a revolving loan fund, can be critical in providing 
the seed money needed to get projects off the planning tables. Tax incentives 
were used in this fashion in the 1970s and 1980s to help fledgling alternative 
energy projects. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing experimental about water reclamation, though. It works. The 
supply is at hand. The need is apparent. With approval of the bond issue this 
year, many local agencies will have the resources needed to complete the cycle.

FORMER JUSTICE ARTHUR GOLDBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our country lost a great American when Arthur J. Goldberg passed away (Part A, 
Jan. 20). One regret is that he left without writing his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been historically important to reveal in detail how President 
Lyndon Johnson persuaded him to leave the Supreme Court for the United Nations 
ambassadorship. As a dear friend since World War II Arthur told me the story 
several times, but it deserved public revelation. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Johnson insisted that Goldberg alone, with his vast labor 
negotiation experience, could help negotiate world peace at the U.N., that it 
was his duty to mankind to make such use of his talents. He then looked Arthur 
in the eye and said, "As your commander in chief I am directing you to 
undertake that responsibility." How could anyone refuse the President of the 
United States, Goldberg would ask rhetorically. However, the potential 
development of another Louis Brandeis or William Brennan was thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
It was not long before disillusionment set in. As United Nations ambassador 
Goldberg did not have free rein; he was subject to directions from the State 
Department and the White House. And it was soon apparent that the real reason 
he was asked to leave the Supreme Court was to make room for President 
Johnson's personal associate Abe Fortas. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I will miss the heartwarming visits with Arthur Goldberg and his 
late wife, Dorothy, both here in California and in Washington. More sadly, the 
nation will miss his wise counsel.

SHAKING THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF AIDS ORTHODOXY; 
</P>
<P>
KAPOSI'S SARCOMA: TWO STUDIES OF THIS CONDITION POSE A QUESTION ONCE CONSIDERED 
A HERESY: WHAT IF HIV IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATIE LEISHMAN, Katie Leishman, a national correspondent for the Atlantic, 
is the author of Epidemic, to be published by Doubleday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week a medical journal, the Lancet, disclosed in an article and letter to 
the editor that Kaposi's sarcoma, the symptom most conspicuously identified 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, may not in fact be caused by HIV, the 
so-called AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The article, from the federal Centers for Disease Control, suggested that 
Kaposi's sarcoma -- frequently called a cancer although that designation has 
lately come into question -- may rather be caused by an "as yet unidentified 
infectious agent transmitted mainly by sexual contact." Although findings 
received modest coverage, they shake the foundations of accepted orthodoxy 
about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the strangest twist in terms of medical news in the epidemic in years," 
says Randy Shilts, author of "And the Band Played On." "It calls into question 
everything -- the existing paradigm for the epidemic, the direction of 
research, treatment modalities and even the integrity of the blood supply." 
</P>
<P>
Kaposi's sarcoma is said to afflict 15% of all AIDS patients. Yet in a series 
of autopsy studies, pathologists report that the condition is almost universal 
in those with AIDS, internally if not dermatologically. "We find the lesions 
which are generally called KS in about 95% of AIDS patients," says Dr. George 
Hensley, professor in the department of pathology at the University of Miami 
Medical School, who oversaw the studies. This suggests a remarkably high 
prevalence rate of a second unknown agent in AIDS patients. Until the agent is 
identified and patients can be tested for it, it is impossible not to wonder 
how many AIDS patients may also be infected with the agent -- and how many of 
their other symptoms may derive from it rather than HIV. 
</P>
<P>
The studies reported in the Lancet are not the first to suggest that prominent 
clinical problems in AIDS may be due to something other than HIV. A lengthy 
review last year in the journal Acta Neuropathologica argued that the central 
nervous system damage in AIDS cannot currently be explained by HIV infection, 
and that indeed "cytopathic infection of neural cells by HIV either does not 
occur or is of little clinical significance." The primary neurological damage 
may be due to a second unidentified infectious agent. We simply do not know. 
</P>
<P>
The two reports also raise disturbing therapeutic issues. Many patients with 
Kaposi's sarcoma are presumptively diagnosed as having AIDS -- without being 
administered an HIV test -- and they are then put on AZT, a toxic anti-viral 
drug and acknowledged carcinogen. Should this treatment, appropriate only to a 
virus, prove irrelevant to Kaposi's sarcoma and perhaps other AIDS symptoms, 
interesting liability issues arise. Treatment strategies, of course, will be 
reevaluated. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have offered 
reassuring explanations for the new findings. Two epidemics must have started 
simultaneously in the same populations, they contend, and HIV remains the 
underlying culprit for everything except Kaposi's sarcoma. This unwieldy 
hypothesis serves as a kind of damage control: Whatever is afflicting Kaposi's 
sarcoma patients has nothing to do with AIDS, and everything else that 
researchers have said about the role of HIV in the epidemic is still true. 
</P>
<P>
One is driven to wonder whether the researchers might have been correct on the 
point they have abandoned -- that Kaposi's sarcoma and all the other dismaying 
symptoms of AIDS do indeed have the same cause -- but are wrong in the one that 
they still cling to: that HIV is the cause of AIDS. To question this has been 
denounced as heresy. But it was also once heresy to question HIV's role in 
Kaposi's sarcoma.

SELF-ESTEEM: A MATTER OF LIFE, DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: 'PADRE, I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE,' SAYS THE 13-YEAR-OLD AFTER A 'HOMEBOY' 
DIES. THIS DESPAIR IS STRONGER THAN ANYTHING THE LAW CAN DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY J. BOYLE, Father Gregory J. Boyle, SJ, is pastor of Dolores Mission 
Catholic Church east of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They cling tightly to the sides of their fallen homeboy's open casket. 
Crouching slightly at the head of the coffin, they pose for a last picture with 
him. "Throwing up" their gang signs and vowing revenge for his murder, they cry 
like the children they are. 
</P>
<P>
And so the 1990 tally of gang-related deaths in my neighborhood is begun. 
</P>
<P>
As the citizens of Los Angeles attempt to interpret the record number of 
gang-related murders and other crimes in 1989, we are cautioned by 
law-enforcement officials not to panic. The 20% increase in gang-motivated 
homicide and the 30% rise in gang-motivated crime, we are told, should not 
indicate that such crime is beyond police control. For 1990, to meet this 
alarming increase head-on, the authorities offer us the hope of tougher law 
enforcement and additional jail space. The facts of 1989, however, do not seem 
to warrant this "more-of-the-same" strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Within the parish boundaries of Dolores Mission (the Aliso Village and Pico 
Gardens housing projects) there are 10 active gangs (nine Latino, one African 
American). Some of them are involved in the sale of drugs, some are notable in 
their abuse of drugs and most are very active in "gang-banging" -- going on the 
attack against other gangs. All of the gang members are unemployed and have in 
common a profound despair. Were they to be consulted on the causes and possible 
solutions to the marked increase in gang activity, additional jail space and 
tougher law enforcement would not figure into their equation. 
</P>
<P>
Gang members know all too well that mass roundups like "Operation Hammer" and 
"tougher" police presence in the housing projects only exacerbate the deep 
antagonism that already exists between law-enforcement officials and residents 
of the barrio. Correctly, the gang members would say that this approach has 
been ineffective. Its deterrence factor is lost on gang members. They do not 
care enough about their own lives to fear incarceration or even death. 
</P>
<P>
In this barrio, "gang-banging," drug-selling, chemical dependence and all other 
criminal activity are symptoms of despair. Recently, I encountered a 
13-year-old crack dealer and gang member standing alone at midnight in an area 
of the projects where one of his homeboys had been shot the previous night. I 
warned him of the dangers. He shrugged and said, "Padre, I have nothing to 
lose." Before long, he was crying, unable to see his way clear beyond the dark 
confines of his own dysfunctional family and his gang allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
Our strategies to date in attacking the gang problem presume that gangsters 
will be deterred by the likes of "Operation Hammer," larger jails or tougher 
cops. Their despondency is deep enough to render these approaches useless. The 
failure of the educational system and the poor job market for minority youth 
have made it almost impossible for gang members to imagine a future for 
themselves. We assume that the youths in gangs hope for something better beyond 
the barrio, a future full of possibility, and would want to avoid having those 
dreams cut down. That assumption is wrong, and so is our reliance on it. 
</P>
<P>
Our distress at the steady rise in gang activity must move us to address the 
root causes of the despair from which it comes. The problem challenges us to 
propose avenues of hope where none seem to exist. 
</P>
<P>
The city's resources would be better spent improving legitimate employment 
opportunities for these youth. On an average day, no less than 10 gang members 
seek my assistance in securing a job. The avenues of possible employment for 
them are slim indeed. The slightest hope that motivates their search for work 
is soon crushed by the fact that there is none to be found. If the community 
and its funds can fashion and present to them an imaginable future, born of 
gainful employment, they will seize the opportunity. The hope for redirecting 
their lives rests in breaking the paralysis of their despair, not police 
pressure. These young people can't "just say no" to gangs unless offered a way 
to "just say yes" to life -- to a tomorrow that holds something better for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
To those children clutching the coffin of their dead homeboy, may the city of 
Los Angeles offer a strategy that confronts their despair.

KIDS NEED TO EARN 'A' IN SELF-CONFIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETENCE: THE BETTER STUDENTS JUDGE THEMSELVES, THE MORE THEY ARE EMOTIONALLY 
LINKED TO SCHOOL, THE BETTER THEIR CLASSROOM PERFORMANCE.

The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social 
Responsibility has just released its report. The findings in "Toward a State of 
Esteem" confirm what we have learned in our educational reform efforts. There's 
a critical link between competence and self-confidence; emotional and character 
development are inextricably linked with instructional development; and, most 
important, successful strategies exist for promoting positive attitudes toward 
self and school. 
</P>
<P>
We've worked hard to upgrade the curriculum and raise the standards of 
California schools. We've also discovered that unless students are willing to 
work considerably harder, they will never reach the higher levels of 
achievement expected of them. Educators not only must train students' minds; 
they must also inspire their hearts and strengthen their wills. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written and said about the academic effectiveness of Japanese 
education. Less is known about how that system nurtures self-esteem, character 
and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, children are encouraged to form a bond with their school. 
Kindergarten begins with an entrance ceremony similar to our graduation 
ceremony. The whole family, dressed in its finest, attends. During the first 
three weeks of school, students learn how to recite, speak out, stand erect and 
be at ease. They also take turns playing leader. Symbolically and ceremonially, 
each Japanese youngster is welcomed into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
In California, our middle schools recently posted the biggest gains in test 
performance ever recorded in a three-year period. When I called the schools to 
find out how they'd done it, a few key strategies emerged. The schools reported 
that they strengthened academics and invested heavily in teacher training. To 
bolster student self-esteem, study teams and schools within schools were formed 
to foster support systems and a more human dimension for youngsters. But all 
strategies had one element in comment: linking student and school emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
The self-esteem task force makes a number of important recommendations along 
these lines that will further strengthen our efforts to reform California 
education. Among them is that self-esteem and responsibility must be woven into 
school programs. Every adult working at a school should feel responsible for 
every youngster in that school. Parents need assistance in becoming more 
effective partners in their child's education. And the entire community needs 
to recognize and understand the diverse needs of the student population. 
</P>
<P>
Students whose lives are plagued by drugs, gangs and teen pregnancy need 
special attention. The key to preventing their failure in school is helping 
them to develop a sense of purpose, feel part of a nurturing community and 
believe in themselves enough to be able to resist peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
We're also finding that students deserve to know the connection between hard 
work and a good job or a good life. If they have clear expectations, 
continually experience the rewards of their work and receive timely support, 
they will be confident enough to tackle the difficulties of a demanding 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some schools have initiated buddy systems in which an older 
student works with a younger one. Others have set up study teams and peer 
counseling that help students help themselves and each other. In still others, 
a teacher remains with the same class for several years to capitalize on the 
bonds developed with the students. In all schools, programs to counteract 
bigotry and prejudice, which destroy self-worth, have been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
If we are going to follow through on these and other recommendations, schools 
also must restructure the way they do business. We can't educate our children 
to higher levels -- recognizing the problems we face with the diversity, 
emotional distress, family upheaval and other real-life pressures -- unless 
educators create high-performance teams at every school. If we expect students 
to develop character, initiative, responsibility and proper attitudes, we need 
to reflect that behavior ourselves. Only by treating each other with respect, 
working together, communicating and forming organizations that promote 
self-esteem and personal and social responsibility can we succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The self-esteem task force has presented us with some tremendous challenges. 
Our work is cut out for us, but it is well worth the effort. We need only to 
look to teachers like Jaime Escalante to see how it can work. Escalante knows 
his subject and knows how to package it for kids. His class is part college, 
part summer camp and part football team. He expects his students to work hard, 
and they do. He expects them to work as a team, and they do. They respond to 
Escalante's spirit, his competence and his belief in them and, as a result, 
reach levels no one ever expected them to reach. That's not a bad prescription 
for every classroom in California.

MEX-AMERICA: A STATE OF MIND; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANT SOULS BY ARTURO ISLAS (WILLIAM MORROW: $16.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Rieff, Rieff, the author of Going to Miami, is a frequent contributor 
to Book Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been a lot of talk lately -- by no means all of it foolish futuristic 
speculation or 1960s-style Chicano nationalist wish-fulfillment -- about the 
birth of a new and original society along the United States-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
To the people who live there, cities like San Diego and Tijuana, El Paso and 
Juarez, seem for better or worse to become more intertwined every year. As 
their economic and cultural interdependency grows, the international boundary 
shrinks into irrelevence -- an increasingly hollow legal fiction in these 
binational metropolises that now resemble each other far more than they do the 
more fully American or Mexican cities farther north or farther south. 
</P>
<P>
The region has an ethos of its own, and, by now, a name: Mex-America. In Carlos 
Fuentes' marvelous dystopian novel, "Christopher Unborn," set in an anarchic 
Mexico of the near future, this Mex-America has become an independent buffer 
state. The future, of course, is unknowable, but even the present is very 
radical indeed. As Arturo Islas' new novel, "Migrant Souls," ably demonstrates, 
Mex-America may not yet exist juridically, but it is already well entrenched as 
a state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
It is not, by all appearances, a comfortable state to inhabit. "The truth is," 
laments young Chicano lawyer Rudy Angel during one of the many family 
gatherings that punctuate Islas' flawed, ambitious book, "we don't know what we 
are because we don't know who we are." The answer, he decides, with a certain 
gritty rue, is that families like his own reside "on the border between a land 
that has forgotten us and another land that does not understand us." 
</P>
<P>
Islas understands this world of loss and mixed allegiance perfectly, and some 
of the strongest moments in his book occur when his characters wrestle with 
their inchoate, painful destinies. 
</P>
<P>
"Migrant Souls" depicts the lives of several generations of the Angel clan in 
the border town of Del Sapo (both an anagram for Islas' native El Paso), and, 
as the narrative unfolds, in other parts of the United States, particularly 
California. Although Islas has one of the Angels say that they are not 
immigrants but migrants -- that is, that it is the border that is the alien 
construct and not their decision to move from one side of the Rio Grande to the 
other -- his book provides a humane and sensible look at what it is to be a 
Mexican immigrant in the United States, particularly in his evocation of the 
younger Angels, professional people in cities such as Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
As with the members of the family who have remained in Del Sapo, this 
generation also lives uncomfortably in two cultures and, if they at last have 
succeeded in belonging to either, it is only uncomfortably. When Rudy says, 
"Let's keep the border and give both lands back to the Indians," he is only 
half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent, Islas has written a sort of "pre-history" of Mex-America. 
Unfortunately, his novel is far less successful as literature than it is as 
sociology or (implicitly) social criticism. There are moments when Islas' 
considerable knowledge of the milieu of "Migrant Souls" seems to get in the way 
of his writing, as if, rather than give his characters a full measure of 
autonomy, he constantly feels the need to cram in one more accurate -- but 
unnecessary -- detail. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a generic problem with the kind of multigenerational saga 
that Islas has attempted. ("Migrant Souls" is the second volume of a projected 
trilogy about the Angel family). Inevitably, the author must try to shoehorn so 
much into the narrative that characterization in depth is elusive -- probably 
the reason why most books of this type are very long. "Migrant Souls," by 
contrast, is only 249 pages; yet it stretches from the 1940s to the present and 
includes several dozen characters. Even if Islas were the most brilliant 
stylist around, there is simply no space to do his characters justice. He 
isn't, and he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his descriptions are simply words, embodying little. Thus, one 
character marries "a decent man of Anglo-Mexican background." Not only is 
background a windy simplification; decent, meant to do all the work in the 
sentence, is in fact all but meaningless. "Migrant Souls" is full of these 
sorts of complacencies of style. Characters never are astounded, they are 
"truly astounded"; they are "overwhelmed by fear and pity" or "filled with pity 
and gratitude"; they erupt into "whoops of laughter" and are forever 
"consoling" themselves, "gasping" or becoming "beside themselves." Islas, so 
subtle when it comes to differentiating character, takes every shortcut where 
language is concerned. In fairness, it should be added that "Migrant Souls" has 
been praised by Denise Levertov and Adrienne Rich for both story and style, 
praise that I find incomprehensible; Islas is as wooden a writer as he is acute 
an observer. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity, because Islas is concerned with subjects too rarely treated in 
contemporary American writing. We need a great realistic novel about the 
border. Had Islas written less self-indulgently, that book might have been 
"Migrant Souls."

LITTLE RED (CHINESE) SCHOOLHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO OPEN MINDS CHINESE CLUES TO THE DILEMMA OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION BY HOWARD 
GARDNER (BASIC BOOKS: $21.95; 326 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Cahill, Cahill, former North American education correspondent for the 
Times (London), is editor of The Bookperson, a new mail-order book review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aproper dilemma needs two horns; and, it would appear from Howard Gardner's 
provocative new book, the dilemma of contemporary education is no exception. 
The horns, in this case, are freedom and discipline. The question before the 
house is how to incorporate both into one's educational scheme without 
slighting either. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred North Whitehead, as Gardner points out, put the matter well, nicely 
articulating the ideal and at the same time implying the great stress involved 
in trying to maintain the two values in balance. "It should be the aim of an 
ideally constructed education," declared Whitehead, "that the discipline should 
be the voluntary issue of free choice and that the freedom should gain an 
enrichment of possibility as the issue of discipline. The two principles, 
freedom and discipline, are not antagonists but should be so adjusted in the 
child's life that they correspond to a natural sway, to and fro, of the 
developing personality." The magisterial Whitehead sonorously labeled this 
to-and-fro-ness "the rhythmic claims of freedom and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
While Gardner readily admits to being a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, a child of 
Rousseau and Dewey, he fears that we in the West may be missing the beat in the 
rhythmic- claims department, having opted to play the single drum of freedom 
over and over. Anyone who has attempted to teach almost anything to almost any 
class in the last 15 years will recognize that he is understating the problem. 
I still recall the numbing disbelief I felt on a day in the mid-'70s upon 
realizing that in a class of 20-odd liberal-arts collegians, no one could 
identify Charlemagne. Hadn't a clue. Had never heard of him, her, it. They had 
freedom, all right -- freedom to know nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In China, Gardner finds a model wholly different from the progressive one he 
has grown comfortable with in American schools. There, even students in the 
lower grades achieve astounding (by Western standards) degrees of proficiency 
in such skills as draftsmanship and harmony. But Gardner finds that the cost of 
the achievement is great, indeed. Creative play, trial-and-error, finding one's 
own solution -- such values are virtually unknown in the Red East. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gardner rightly assumes that all this lock-step learning was not 
invented by the Communists and must go back essentially to more ancient models, 
he is amazingly incurious about a raft of cultural questions. He appears, for 
instance, to assume that the stupefying proficiency of Chinese children has its 
origins in school. Actually, had he bothered to examine the drawings of 
preschool children he would have found them to be even more spectacularly 
proficient than their Western counterparts of the same age, as anyone who has 
attended American nursery schools with Asian-born children can readily attest. 
</P>
<P>
The best explanation I have heard of this phenomenon is chopsticks, the early 
mastery of which Oriental nations themselves believe encourages their 
extraordinary eye-hand coordination. The concentration that the manipulation of 
a pair of chopsticks requires of a tiny child (who must use them to eat) may 
well upgrade other proficiencies -- such as harmonics. Whatever the 
explanation, how could a scientist not ask himself radical questions about 
causality when faced with such an unusual cultural phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
Given his lack of curiosity, we cannot expect Gardner to understand Chinese 
civilization from the inside out, to make himself sufficiently Chinese to 
figure out what is really going on. Instead, we are given a sort of travelogue 
of his experiences in China, skin-deep impressions of a man who can never let 
go of his own identity long enough to truly comprehend another's. 
</P>
<P>
Even more surprising, Gardner shows little comprehension of the Western 
tradition that he continually invokes. He seems to think that there is a direct 
line from Socrates through the Enlightenment to contemporary America; though 
there is much invocation of the "Greco-Roman" and modern agnostic strands in 
our heritage, the Judeo-Christian font is never cited. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Gardner fails to notice that the profound difference between us and 
the Chinese is not one of communist versus democrat or ancient versus modern 
but one of religious intuition. Our ideas of freedom and individual vocation 
spring from neither Athens nor the philosophes but from the humanly singular 
tradition that began with Abraham setting out from his city for the unknown. 
This is the inception of our tradition -- the tradition of the New, the only 
tradition that welcomes Surprise. 
</P>
<P>
But Gardner is never less than earnest and genial, and while his accounts, both 
of his own upbringing (in a German-Jewish immigrant household in Scranton) and 
of his encounters with the Chinese, lack the high drama and flash of insight 
expected in great stories of cultural exchange, his book abounds with discrete 
illuminations. 
</P>
<P>
He calls for American educators to recognize not intelligence but intelligences 
-- "multiple cognitive capacities," many of which are not accounted for by 
conventional IQ tests. (He names seven such capacities: linguistic, 
logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal and 
intrapersonal.) 
</P>
<P>
He points out that our testing children for creativity often turns up nothing 
more than cocktail-party inventiveness, rather than the capacity to fashion -- 
"often over significant periods of time -- products or projects that actually 
change the ways in which other individuals apprehend the world." Chinese 
education, he notes, is basically concerned with performance, ours with 
understanding. He argues for the reinstitution of apprenticeships. And he calls 
for an admixture of Chinese discipline -- in very watered-down measures -- to 
our current progressive models. 
</P>
<P>
He goes off the rails entirely, I think, when toward the end of the book, he 
unveils an idea he calls "individual-centered learning," a fantasy in which the 
school's sophisticated testing of its students for a wide variety of strengths 
and weaknesses would result in the development of completely individualized 
curricula -- one per child. Where, I wonder, do educational theorists hang out? 
Surely not in any schools in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's misperceptions of the nature of the gulf between him and his Chinese 
hosts are echoed here in his misperception of the extent of the gulf between a 
Harvard professor's daydreams and the lives of the American poor, who tend to 
come from households that have nothing remotely like either the discipline of 
China or that of Gardner's childhood home (nor the freedom of such a home's 
expectations) and who desperately need schooling in both structure and 
creativity -- but mediated to their situation, and at a cost society can 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
This is the real, four-horned dilemma of contemporary education, one that we as 
a nation will fail to solve at our peril.

reading scripts -- so he faced Monday with that enthusiastic feeling of being 
caught up. But it never lasts very long. He woke about 6:30 a.m. Monday to 
confront his fitness trainer, Pete Steinfeld, who ran him through his sweats

</P>
<P>
 Hargrove then departed for home to eat supper and put his feet up. He ran "The 
Detective," just released on videocassette, with Alec Guinness playing 
priest-sleuth Father Brown. "I figure that since we traffic in this (as in the 
"Father Dowling" intrigues), it would be useful to see," he said. Then to bed

<P>
You're visiting a castle. There's a lake, 
</P>
<P>
A hill, a wood, gardens, a herd of deer, 
</P>
<P>
And then inside, paintings of lakes and hills, 
</P>
<P>
Mounted antlers, the cornucopian year 
</P>
<P>
Carved in four oak festoons -- you're here to slake 
</P>
<P>
A once-yearly thirst for the concentrate 
</P>
<P>
Of irretrievable times. It doesn't work -- 
</P>
<P>
Like drinking to get drunk and staying sober; 
</P>
<P>
The trees don't make a wood, that rain-pocked murk 
</P>
<P>
Won't turn into a lake, you can't translate 
</P>
<P>
These stones into a castle . . . Time to go; 
</P>
<P>
The windows darken as you set off home --

<P>
Room after room, the blaze of chandeliers 
</P>
<P>
Sliding away like honey from a comb, 
</P>
<P>
Days out of a life, or any slow 
</P>
<P>
Extinguishing of fire . . . Much later on, 
</P>
<P>
Reaching a village with a puddled street 
</P>
<P>
And wet bronze soldier, slowing down, you see 
</P>
<P>
Framed in a window misted by the heat 
</P>
<P>
Of a single lamp and her own action, 
</P>
<P>
A woman playing the cello, all alone 
</P>
<P>
In a plain room at a plain brass music stand, 
</P>
<P>
But cradling rose-grained curves and scrolls of wood 
</P>
<P>
Like something alive; one splayed-out, powerful hand 
</P>
<P>
Trembling where her blood pulses into the tone 
</P>
<P>
As she plunges and draws back the bow -- 
</P>
<P>
She seems incongruous in this dead place, 
</P>
<P>
Its only light her own. You cannot hear 
</P>
<P>
But you can see the music in her face, 
</P>
<P>
Its ecstasies -- you see it now 
</P>
<P>
And it's not a face you see, but a lake 
</P>
<P>
Mottled like jade with lily-pads, dead leaves, 
</P>
<P>
Gold in a silk-tailed swish scrolled through the black -- 
</P>
<P>
You climb a hill, and underfoot thick sheaves 
</P>
<P>
Of wet grass furrow silver like the track 
</P>
<P>
A finger leaves in velvet. Browsing deer 
</P>
<P>
Move like a forest carpet come to life -- 
</P>
<P>
Split chestnut eyes, bare branches, wet red leaves 
</P>
<P>
Dotted with melting snow, you catch a whiff 
</P>
<P>
Of wild rose, then white battlements appear.

SHEDDING OLD LIGHT ON FEMINISM; 
</P>
<P>
ON HER OWN GROWING UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE AMERICAN DREAM BY RUTH SIDEL 
(VIKING: $18.95; 243 PP.; 0-670-83154-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wanda Urbanska, Urbanska is the author of The Singular Generation: Young 
Americans in the 1980s (Doubleday: 1986). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young American women between the ages of 12 and 25 are ambitious self-starters 
who want to make it on their own, not by riding the coattails of any Prince 
Charming they might snare, writes Ruth Sidel in her new book "On Her Own: 
Growing Up in the Shadow of the American Dream." These women have appropriated 
the American dream and internalized the message that they must be active 
players in their own lives if they are to succeed and nail high-pay, 
high-status jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Sidel, a professor of sociology at New York City's Hunter College and author of 
a noted 1986 study of the feminization of poverty, argues that this ethic is a 
new one and something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, young women should 
prepare to be self-supporting, she writes. But by buying the contemporary 
version of the American dream uncritically -- which in Reagan's '80s took on an 
aggressively individualistic, success-at-any-price cast -- young women may be 
turning their backs on traditional female sources of strength and leadership, 
such as nurturing and community-building, while turning a deaf ear to the needs 
of members of their own sex, who are disproportionately poor and underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Sidel deserves credit for placing the spotlight on a group of Americans who 
have been largely overlooked by the media and even by that group of middle-age 
feminists of which Sidel appears to be a charter member. But for all her good 
intentions, neither her legwork nor her analysis reveals much that's original, 
provocative or even newsworthy about young women today. (Sidel refuses to call 
12-year-olds "girls"; they are "women.") She asks 150-plus interviewees the 
usual questions about sex and marriage and children and career plans and comes 
away with the usual answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Young women of all classes talk about the need to be independent," Sidel 
reports. "Some quote their mothers and other female relatives who are urging 
them to organize their lives so that they can take care of themselves. A 
17-year-old Midwestern daughter of divorced parents reports: 'My mom tells me I 
have to be self-secure. I don't want to have to depend on anyone.' " While 
these findings are accurate, they're hardly revelatory. The goal of 
self-sufficiency among young people -- particularly young women -- has been 
documented for years. 
</P>
<P>
"Many women with whom I spoke seemed to indicate that relationships between men 
and women have not changed all that much," writes Sidel. Teen women are the 
victims of the mixed messages fed by the media and the culture at large: 
Sexuality appears glamorous and desirable on TV and in ads, but if teen-age 
women are premeditated about it (as in using contraception), they run the 
danger of being called sluts. 
</P>
<P>
Again, this sounds consistent with all we know about the nation's 
teen-pregnancy epidemic, but no more. There is no poignant case history here to 
shed new light on the problem, nor does Sidel prescribe specific solutions to 
the crisis, as did Lisbeth B. Schorr in her 1988 book "Within Our Reach: 
Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even Sidel seems disappointed at her findings. "As if programmed, the 
same words, the same dreams tumbled out of the mouths of young women from very 
different backgrounds and life experiences," she writes. "Success was seen, 
overwhelmingly, in terms of what they would be able to purchase, what kind of 
'life style' they would have. The ability to consume in an upper-middle-class 
manner was often the ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The uniformity of responses is reminiscent of interviews with young people in 
China in the early 1970s. When they were asked what they hoped to do when they 
finished school, the answer invariably was, 'Whatever my country wishes me to 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
With such a lack of texture and variation, one cannot help but wonder if the 
young women gave the professor the expected answer rather than baring their 
souls. 
</P>
<P>
Sidel might be forgiven pat, predictable and repetitious answers if her 
analyses were penetrating. Sadly, Sidel falls short here, as well. As she is 
wont to do throughout the book, Sidel poses rhetorical questions that one 
suspects suggest her theories without stating them. On her subjects' worldly 
ambitions, for instance, she wonders: "Are these young women programmed or 
'brainwashed,' or are they too reflecting the tone -- and the economic reality 
-- of their time? 
</P>
<P>
"Are young women focusing on material possessions in part because they are at 
least something to hold on to, symbols of identity and security in an era of 
fragmented family life, insecure, often transient work relationships, and a 
vanishing sense of community?" 
</P>
<P>
While Sidel's sympathy for these young women is laudable, her refusal to spit 
it out, to spell out her theories, frustrates the reader. She is like a 
well-intentioned party guest with whom you agree politically but from whom you 
are aching to break away. 
</P>
<P>
As if admitting her failure to sustain a book on the title subject, after the 
first 89 pages of text -- in which she divides the young women into three 
categories: the New American Dreamers, Neo-traditionalists, and Outsiders -- 
Sidel retreats from what should be the heart of the matter, the young women 
themselves, and launches into a generalized discussion about the state of 
American womanhood today. She addresses the nursing shortage; Carol Gilligan's 
thesis that women see themselves in " 'a relationship of connection' (to 
others)"; and after the fashion of Betty Friedan's 1963 "The Feminine 
Mystique," analyzes the content of 14 major women's magazines in March of 1988. 
(She mistakenly refers to the magazine New Woman as New Women.) She critiques 
popular television shows and detective novels, and even takes on the Miss 
America Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
A feminist attack on beauty pageants in the 1990s seems as dated as 
bra-burning. "While some of us may scoff and mock this archaic vestige of 
another era," Sidel writes, "an estimated 55 million Americans -- 75 percent of 
them women -- tune in each year to watch the Miss America Pageant. . . . No 
matter how well they juggle or sing or play 'Malaguena' on the accordion, we 
all know that it is their measurements and pretty faces and how well they turn 
that are really being judged." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, Sidel has failed to tune into the pageant recently, because what's 
striking today is how all-American, or unglamorous, the contestants appear. 
Recent winners are more likely to be headed for Stanford Business School or 
Harvard Law than for central casting. A fresher analysis would critique the 
women for parading their brains along with their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Such sloppiness aside, some of the trends and familiar touchstones Sidel cites 
offer hope for our next generation. But, at core, this book does little more 
than repackage what is already in the air and in the media about women, young 
and older. We deserve better.

Richard Eder finds "depressing" and "complacent" (H. L.) Mencken's note to 
himself that "there is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable" for the 
Maryland Club (Book Review, Jan. 14). 
</P>

As a curmudgeonly Jew, I see the remark as exquisite sarcasm.

OFF-THE-WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Reviewer) John Rothchild's point, "You could almost make a case that Wall 
Street has been ignored in literature," is well taken and amusingly argued 
("Rascal Money," Book Review, Jan. 7). Rothchild carefully limits himself to 
"important novels," so perhaps he may be forgiven for not mentioning the work 
of John D. Macdonald. 
</P>
<P>
To mention only one of many Macdonald books that turned on money issues, the 
Travis McGee mystery "Pale Gray for Guilt" explored a real estate syndication 
scam and a stock manipulation in the development of its plot. 
</P>
<P>
Macdonald earned a Harvard MBA, as I understand. And he certainly didn't limit 
himself to "baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish" in his choice of 
interesting subjects. 
</P>
<P>
I'll mention this, too. Two years ago, my agent put me in touch with a book 
packager who asked me to prepare a proposal for a series of mysteries to be 
called "Wall Street Undercover." Nothing came of it -- the packager didn't have 
his ducks all in a row, as the Wall Streeters might say -- but I can vouch that 
the interest in Wall Street fiction is out there.

A PYNCHON OF SALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was surprised to see four complaints about Prof. (Frank) McConnell's review 
of Thomas Pynchon's new novel "Vineland" (Letters, Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
After reading the review, I picked up the novel and couldn't put it down. 
</P>
<P>
I thank your reviewer for prompting me to read the book. 
</P>
<P>
One reader complained that McConnell is a partisan Pynchonist. McConnell's 
review is unreservedly enthusiastic and thus reflects the liveliness of the 
text. I mean rilly, you want a thanatoid reviewer? A discreet, academic, 
over-revised response is inappropriate to such a book. 
</P>
<P>
One reader complained that McConnell is an elitist academic for saying that 
"Vineland," like other Pynchon novels, is readable. I'd have to say that 
"Gravity's Rainbow," with entropic approach to theme, is truly intimidating, 
and that "Vineland" is a new departure in its accessibility and also in its 
overt political theme. But a reading of "Vineland" leaves us readers charged 
enough to read through Pynchon from the beginning.

SHAW BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the photograph accompanying Brian Peterson's worthy review of "Bernard Shaw 
on Photography" (Book Review, Dec. 31), Shaw is pointing his (Leica 35 mm 
camera) at a subject but, strangely, looking through the view finder with his 
left eye with the finger of his right hand on the shutter button. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't quite normal unless Shaw's right eye is "better" than his right 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
Was Shaw left-handed and possibly posed this way to exhibit more of his face? 
Or was the picture "flipped" in printing?

OFF-THE-WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Wall Street dull? No. Are the people who work in Wall Street dull? Probably, 
but no more so than any pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
I have worked with any number of "street" people for the last 22 years and got 
to know them fairly well. Analysts, retail brokers, corporate finance syndicate 
men, investment bankers, market makers, money managers. Have I left anyone out? 
Of all that number there is only one I could say is in any way colorful: Noble 
Trenham, who owns First Global Securities. You think I am making that up, don't 
you? 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street, on the inside, is intricate, finely tuned, and sensitively 
balanced, like a clock. But, as with a clock, we are not interested in what 
goes on inside. We just want to look at the face and see what time it is. Wall 
Street is like that.

OFF-THE-WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My compliments on your review of "Rascal Money" (too bad the book didn't quite 
come up to snuff), but what I'm really writing about is the first part of John 
Rothchild's review, where he wonders that there are so few novels about Wall 
Street. True, there aren't many, but you left out some of the best books of all 
about that bastion of capitalism -- the mystery novels of Emma Lathen. 
</P>
<P>
* 
</P>
<P>
Her (their) sleuth is John Putnam Thatcher, senior V.P. of the Sloan Guaranty 
Trust, "third largest bank in the work." All the books involve a particular 
business or profession (and murder, of course), and many of them involve the 
intricacies of the New York Stock Exchange, the commodities market (cocoa 
futures), investment banking and brokerage houses. The authors evidently steep 
themselves in a particular line of work and then set their mysteries in that 
milieu. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite is "Death Shall Overcome" (1966), about the election of the first 
black to a seat on the NYSE: "Sweet and Low," about the cocoa exchange; "Murder 
Against the Grain," involving Wall Street and the U.S.S.R. . . . The books are 
marvelously witty. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you didn't mention them in your review because they are mysteries, not 
"serious" novels, Pfui, as Nero Wolfe would say. They are sophisticated, 
entertaining books, and they are certainly about Wall Street! If you haven't 
read any of them, I'm sure you'd enjoy them 
</P>
<P>
* Emma Lathen is the pen name of two ladies of exceptional talent, one a lawyer 
and the other an economist.

John Rothchild's claim that authors consider the Stock Market too dull to write 
about is without merit. Has he never heard of Emma Lathen? 
</P>
<P>
She is -- or they are -- a mystery-writing team . . . and the 20 novels she -- 
they -- have written are filled with humor, making the world of banking and the 
market fascinating.

Two new installments in Voyageur's "Wilderness" series devoted to America's

Mike Link's descriptions of the animals and people who inhabit the Arizona 
deserts and riparian environments have a crisp clarity lacking in the other 
writers' work. Connie Toops' personal accounts of trekking through the forests 
and swamps of the Everglades really don't tell the reader much about that 
fragile, threatened environment. But most people will buy these large-format 
books for the gorgeous color photographs of egrets, cacti, sunsets, etc. that 
make both volumes resemble outsize Sierra Club calendars.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: KING SOLOMON'S MINES BY H. RIDER HAGGARD (OXFORD: $2.25) 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First published in 1885, "King Solomon's Mines" still ranks as one of the great 
adventure stories of all time, rivaling "The Man Who Would Be King" and "Beau 
Geste." The quest for a fabulous cache of diamonds takes three English 
adventurers to the imaginary kingdom of Kukuanaland. 
</P>
<P>
The overthrow of the cruel despot, Twala, by his virtuous nephew, Ignosi, 
embodies the 19th-Century British beliefs in the noble savage and the 
civilizing effects of European culture. Modern readers will be amused to 
discover that Allan Quartermain, Haggard's reluctant swashbuckler, is the 
obvious ancestor of Indiana Jones, Jack Flashman and countless other 
tongue-in-cheek heroes. Although the casual slaughter of African wildlife by 
Quartermain and his friends seems appalling by today's standards, even 
ecological activists will find this dashing saga hard to resist.

<TEXT>
<P>
Marshall McLuhan's central thesis, that the medium of transmission determines 
how information is perceived, has obvious implications for a society 
increasingly saturated with electronic data. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution in communications technology that spawned the FAX machine, the 
personal computer with modem, cable and satellite television and the video 
cassette has brought his concept of the "global village" closer to reality. 
Ironically, McLuhan's ideas remain fresh and cogent, but their presentation in 
this reprint has become a hilariously passe monument to hip '60s graphics. The 
solarized photographs, exotic type faces, Op Art patterns and serial images 
make this book seem as dated as a zoot suit.

By CAROLYN MEYER, Meyer is the author of Voices of South Africa: Growing Up in 
a Troubled Land and other fiction and nonfiction for young adults. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Young people caught up in events of their times, teen-agers who reject the 
cautious conservatism of their elders and do what they believe is right, are 
the subjects of three books, one set in present-day South Africa, another in 
the United States during the Vietnam War, the third the biography of a teen-age 
girl said to have inspired more books than any other woman in history, Joan of 
Arc. Courage is the common denominator as young people ask tough questions, 
examine their values, make hard decisions, and act on them. 
</P>
<P>
In "Chain of Fire" by Beverley Naidoo, illustrated by Eric Velasquez 
(Lippincott: $12.95; 224 pp.) a 15-year-old Black girl resists the forced 
removal of her entire village from their homes to a barren "homeland," remote, 
scattered fragments of the poorest land, set aside by the apartheid government 
of South Africa for its Blacks. The village land is to be turned over to white 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Naledi and other young villagers attempt to organize a protest march. But they 
are opposed not only by white officials but by other Blacks; the village chief 
who has betrayed them, the informer who reports on them, the school principal 
who cruelly puts down every sign of protest, the black policemen and bulldozer 
operators following the orders of whites. The chain of fire of the title is the 
fierce anger that binds the defiant young heroine to her family, to her friends 
in prison, and to her people. 
</P>
<P>
This is not only the story of what happens to one family and one village; it is 
a clear explanation of how young South African Blacks are politicized. In an 
author's note, Beverly Naidoo, a white South African who has moved to England, 
comments on her upbringing and the anger she still feels "about the racist 
distortions of reality -- passed on to me as a child." Anger was my reaction 
too when I went to South Africa a few years ago to do research for a book, but 
my anger was a pale shadow of the rage of the blacks I met. Reading this fine 
novel reminded me of my own feelings, and of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ulvang, his sister, Sarah, and Will Spencer have been the best of friends 
for years. But this is the last spring they'll be together -- the boys are 
seniors, graduating in a month. The year is 1969. Nightly TV newscasts focus on 
the war in Vietnam, an issue that becomes an argument in Dan's and Sarah's 
household, where their authoritarian father silences any mumblings against the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
As Margaret I. Rostkowski's novel "The Best of Friends" (Harper &amp; Row: 
$12.95; 192 pp.) unfolds, conflict develops among the three: Dan, the 
overachieving perfectionist driven by his demanding father, in turn driving 
Will, an easygoing and directionless sort until Dan goads him. Sarah, drawn to 
Will, is caught between the two. War and the peace movement are central issues 
as the three friends try to figure out who they are, what they really believe, 
and what they want for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Novels about the Vietnam years are coming along thick and fast now for the 
children of the children of the '60s. "The Best of Friends" is among the better 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Joan of Arc, whose noble ideals cost her her life when she was only 19, remains 
one of history's most famous teen-agers. Polly Schoyer Brooks tells her story 
in "Beyond the Myth: The Story of Joan of Arc" (Lippincott: $13.95; 160 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the book deals with Joan's unshakable belief that she was 
chosen by God to rescue the kingdom of France, and with her efforts to do just 
that; the second part covers her imprisonment, trial, and execution. It's a 
story rich in fascinating detail. 
</P>
<P>
An illiterate 15th-Century peasant, Joan experienced her first vision when she 
was 13. "Voices" later spoke to her, urging her to fight for France against the 
English, comforting her when things went badly for her at the end when she was 
convicted of heresy and burned at the stake. Brooks points out that hearing 
voices was not all that unusual in the pre-scientific era, when people looked 
to the supernatural for explanations of their world and for help in dealing 
with it. The voices Joan claimed to hear have been disputed and explained away, 
but they were real enough to her and fueled her extraordinary courage. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks makes a point of explaining the importance of Joan's virginity. Greatly 
prized in those days, virginity was considered to have almost magical powers, 
and Joan, who had sworn to remain a virgin, submitted twice to examinations to 
prove that she was indeed "pure." Had she not, she would have been instantly 
condemned as a witch, a consort of the devil. One of the major issues at her 
trial for heresy was her insistence on wearing men's clothes, a sin according 
to the Bible although a practical solution for a female soldier on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Brooks's introduction, meant to explain the complex political 
situation of 15th-Century France, sets a tone of pedantry that's hard to shake 
off. The conversational author's note placed at the end would have been a more 
inviting way to introduce readers to this brilliant and courageous and 
altogether human young woman.

A new Sunday newspaper was launched, aimed at winning a largely young, 
well-educated readership. The Independent on Sunday is the latest product of a 
newspaper boom fed by computer technology and hopes to win readers from the 
Sunday Times. "Obviously we will be going for their readers and trying to 
persuade them to buy our paper," said Editor Stephen Glover, who expects sales 
of 500,000 copies per issue in the first year.

SUPER MATCHUP: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE TEAM OF THE '70S FACED THE TEAM OF THE 
'80S? FUNNY YOU ASKED . . . 
</P>

<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE: What would happen if the best Pittsburgh Steeler team of the 
1970s played the best San Francisco 49er team of the 1980s? XOR Corp. of 
Minneapolis, which produced the computerized NFL "Dream Season" televised last 
fall by ESPN, matched the 1978 Steelers and the current 49ers in a copyright 
computer-simulated game for The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The football rises, first a blur, then a bird above outstretched arms, 
ratcheting higher with every rotation, end over end over end. San Francisco's 
Mike Cofer unwinds his leg to find that Pittsburgh's Mean Joe Greene has landed 
at his feet and the answer to the question -- who was better, Steelers or 49ers 
-- is at long last up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I always had a great deal of respect for the teams I played for 
and against that were on that level," said Greene, a fearsome Hall of Fame 
selection who played his entire career (1969-82) with the Steelers and now 
coaches their defensive line, "and I wouldn't want to embarrass myself by 
trying to make comparisons that are too exact. 
</P>
<P>
"The team I played on is history, the 49ers are the team right now. They've 
still got history to make; ours is in the can. In that way, it reminds me of 
the comparisons people made between us and the great Packer teams. They were 
different eras, so you have to use different measures. 
</P>
<P>
"But the first step, obviously, is whether you've won the games you have to 
just to be considered at that level. The next thing, and this you can measure 
over time, is to see how many guys ultimately end up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember looking at the Packers and it seemed like half their offense was in 
there. So I started looking at our football team and saying, 'Could we get 
someone better than the guy playing next to you?' And during that time, the 
answer, position by position, was almost always no." 
</P>
<P>
"Still," Greene concluded, "I'm only prepared to say how we stacked up against 
the times -- not against time." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Greene's tenure with Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain defense enveloped one of 
the most incredible runs in any sport at any time -- four Super Bowl 
championships in only six seasons, twice (1975-76 and 1979-80) back-to-back. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason alone, Keena Turner would be a less-than-enthusiastic 
participant in the Dream Game. But there is another, even more immediate reason 
why he is loathe to make the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"Standing here," said Turner, scanning the roof of the cavernous Superdome 
through dark glasses, "we are still one achievement shy. And so to do that at 
this time would almost be disrespectful. 
</P>
<P>
"But the first thing that jumps out at me about the Steelers was the talent. 
Think a minute about that team, how long most of those guys played together . . 
. and you can find a lot of people who could name almost the entire starting 
teams, offense and defense. That alone gives you some measure of how good a 
team it was. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike those Steelers, this team has turned over quite a bit since our first 
win," said Turner, one of only five 49ers to play for the club's initial Super 
Bowl championship (1982) and still present for a shot at a fourth. "I actually 
believe they had the best talent of their time, maybe of all time. I don't 
think we can say that." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Gerela lofts the opening kickoff toward the right side of the field where 
John Taylor receives it at the 8-yard line, slants 12 yards to the middle to 
pick up a wall of blockers, then cuts sharply back to the right sideline and 
down a corridor of daylight. 
</P>
<P>
There is little in John Taylor's background to suggest that he would become one 
of the best receivers and kick returners in the NFL, and in that way, as a 
classic late bloomer, his story is typical of what made the San Francisco 49ers 
the team of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
With a keen eye for talent and deep pockets, the people who make up the 
organization have always been willing to spend the time and money to get one 
step beyond the league's stated goal of parity. In Taylor's case, it required 
both. 
</P>
<P>
Skinny and the son of a mailman, Taylor walked away from football after high 
school because no scholarship offers were forthcoming and went to work loading 
boxes at a liquor warehouse. After his mother convinced him to go to college, 
he walked on at little Delaware State and soon won a free ride. 
</P>
<P>
When he was drafted in 1987, though, Taylor's skills were far from polished and 
he was hardly the game-breaker the 49ers had projected him to be. That was all 
right, too. San Francisco already had the best in the business at his position, 
a fellow named Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's second season, 1988, began with a 30-day suspension for substance 
abuse, and while he showed glimpses of brilliance as a punt returner, his 
skills as a wide receiver appeared only marginally improved after that. 
</P>
<P>
But he capped the season by catching the winning touchdown in last year's Super 
Bowl and for the rest of 1989 and on into this year, he began making good on 
the 49ers' investment. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the quiet determination and the fluid stride are in full evidence 
as Taylor zooms 52 yards up the right sideline before being knocked out of 
bounds at the Pittsburgh 40. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana lines up behind center and surveys the defense through clear blue 
eyes. The first play already has been selected by Coach George Seifert, in 
concert with offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren, from among almost two dozen 
appropriate to the situation. And even as Montana assesses the white Steeler 
jerseys in formation, he tries to predict the chances of its success. 
</P>
<P>
Backing up, Montana sees that his primary target, Rice on a 15-yard sideline 
pattern up the right, has drawn double coverage and that Taylor, slanting 
across the middle, has been dumped unceremoniously by a still-bouncing Jack 
Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly less than three seconds have elapsed and Montana can feel L.C. 
Greenwood pushing mightily a few steps to his left. He glides to his right, 
finds a third receiver, running back Roger Craig, waiting in the flat, and zips 
the ball there. Craig makes eight yards and Mel Blount exacts punishment for 
each one with a jarring tackle at the Steelers' 32-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the 49ers, but more revealing of his own work ethic, Montana has 
spent countless hours in front of a video camera after practice, perfecting the 
fake handoff by placing it at the perspective of the defender he is seeking to 
freeze, and reviewing the film. Now, this investment, too, pays off, as he 
completes two of three short passes to three different receivers, mixing in a 
Craig run of four yards, to bring the ball to the 14. 
</P>
<P>
Looking on now from the comfort of the television booth, Bill Walsh can only 
smile. He devised the system that brought the 49ers roaring into the '80s, and 
taking full advantage of owner Eddie DeBartolo's limitless checkbook, 
thoughtfully stocked it with players perfectly matched to the time and task at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Montana lasted until the third round of the 1979 draft because few besides 
Walsh were willing to take a flyer on a string bean who moved like Fred Astaire 
and probably couldn't heave a football much farther. But Walsh knew the Notre 
Dame product could always find time and a throwing lane among the bigger pass 
rushers, and he was willing to let the course of things prove him right. It 
did. But the best testament to Walsh's vision is not that the 49ers have 
perfected the system that he willed them. Rather, it is that they have not 
stopped tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
And so, with center Jesse Sapolu pulling to lead the sweep -- a new wrinkle to 
an old play -- Craig picks his way 14 yards through a minefield for the game's 
first score and Cofer adds the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 7, Pittsburgh 0. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Motivation," he added, "never was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of safety Ronnie Lott, the 49er defense was without a 
marquee name, ridiculed as a finesse unit that stumbled from one crisis to 
another just in time to put out the small fires on the field. And because the 
49ers seemed able to score at will, the group came to be regarded as the one 
that killed time between the last Montana play and the next. 
</P>
<P>
But only the unschooled regarded them that way for long. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the superstars on offense to overshadow them," said Jim Everett, 
the promising young Los Angeles Ram quarterback whose coronation as the passer 
of the 1990s will, in all likelihood, have to wait for Montana's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"But anyone underrating the 49ers defense would be, No. 1, stupid," he said and 
paused before adding: "And I don't have a No. 2 or 3." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Bradshaw came out of Louisiana Tech in 1970 as one of the most 
sought-after quarterbacks in many a year, but it was his missile-launching 
right arm, and not the head that directed it, that the scouts always praised. 
</P>
<P>
He was not stupid, though by his own admission he was often too nervous or 
scared or both to master what his own coaches and opposing defenses frequently 
threw at him. Unlike Montana, he did most of his learning on the job, and his 
coach, Chuck Noll, while often as aloof as Walsh, was decidedly less patient. 
As a rookie, Bradshaw threw four times as many interceptions (24) as touchdowns 
(6). 
</P>
<P>
"You had to test yourself constantly, you couldn't ever relax," Bradshaw said, 
"because every pat on your back you knew could just as quickly turn into a 
slap." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the NFL adopted two new rules to enhance the aerial game, allowing 
offensive linemen to use their hands on pass blocking and limiting defenders to 
a single block against a receiver within five yards of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes convinced Walsh that the path to success in the NFL would be made 
through the air, and that Montana was the man who would blaze it. And with 
nowhere to take the moribund San Francisco franchise but up, he embraced the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Noll and the Steelers saw things much the same, and besides, they had little 
choice but to follow. The Steel Curtain and the marvelous Franco Harris, 
mainstays of a franchise that never lost more than five games a season from 
1972 through 1979, were both showing the wear and tear of age. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dream Game, the 49ers' rotating zone in the secondary is giving Bradshaw 
considerable problems, so the Steelers play a conservative style of football 
early. But in the closing minute of the first quarter, following a punt to 
their own 30, the Steelers open it up. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw to John Stallworth for 32. Harris up the middle for three, then around 
the left end for six more. Eight more on a quick-release to tight end Randy 
Grossman over the middle. Harris and Rocky Bleier pounding steadily away for 
four and five yards at a clip. Stallworth again for 10. 
</P>
<P>
Now poised over center at the San Francisco 20-yard line, Bradshaw looks at 
Stallworth to his right and Lynn Swann to his left. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bradshaw, Swann became a Steeler because of a propitious coin flip on 
draft day. Unlike Bradshaw, however, he was considered something of a gamble, 
certainly tall and graceful enough, but slow. Yet, the Steelers, worthy of 
their place in a shot-and-beer town, gambled by taking him with the 20th pick 
of the first round and set the tone for a run of luck on draft day that has 
never been equaled. 
</P>
<P>
None of the picks quite fit the NFL mold, but collectively they secured 
Pittsburgh's present and guaranteed its future: In the second round, they 
grabbed Lambert, a linebacker from one of the few programs (Kent State) that 
carried less weight than he did (195 pounds); in the fourth round, Stallworth 
from out-of-the-way Alabama A&amp;M; in the fifth, Mike Webster, a center 
seemingly too small to play for big Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Walsh said with the benefit of hindsight, "the best draft ever." 
</P>
<P>
And so, with Stallworth drawing Lott to the right, Webster battling 49er nose 
tackle Michael Carter to a standstill in the middle, and the certifiably loony 
Lambert raging up and down the sidelines, Bradshaw goes over the top to Swann 
for 20 yards and a touchdown. Only to have the dependable Gerela miss the extra 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 7, Pittsburgh 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The second and third quarters of the Dream Game, like the middle round of a 
fight between two skilled boxers, settles into a pattern of punching and 
counterpunching, with the kickers serving as the surrogates. 
</P>
<P>
Montana is harried, but not sacked, though twice he is hurried and the price is 
a pair of interceptions. The first of two by Mel Blount is returned 25 yards 
early in the second quarter. But after the drive stalls deep in 49ers' 
territory, the Steelers settle for a 26-yard Gerela field goal and their first 
lead of the game, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Gerela is successful a second time, this one from 33 yards, then Cofer answers 
with one of his own from 31. Blount carries his second theft just five yards, 
but Bradshaw covers the remaining 32 in a single breath, Stallworth wresting 
the rainbow throw away from Eric Wright for 19-10 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh consumes the lion's share of the clock in the third quarter as well, 
but to little avail. The fours and fives that Harris and Bleier ground out at 
the start of the game are routinely being trimmed to twos and threes, and 
Bradshaw, the long ball taken away by the twice-burned San Francisco defense, 
is only moderately successful throwing underneath the zone. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, meanwhile, move steadily if unspectacularly with two long drives in 
the period. On both, Montana runs off a string of completions, but each time 
the Steelers' defense stiffens and Seifert's patience is rewarded with field 
goals of 25 and 28 yards. The second, coming near the close of the quarter, 
draws San Francisco to 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things we did after winning our third Super Bowl last year," 
Keena Turner said, "was talk about winning a fourth, about repeating the way 
the Steelers did. 
</P>
<P>
"But that goal, all by itself, isn't going to give you enough reason to be 
successful. Reasons have to be deeper-rooted than that and they have to be 
individual. So we always tried to compete against ourselves. Not against 
Denver, not against Pittsburgh. Against ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Montana is the perfect example of that. Joe competes only against Joe. If 
anyone has the right to float on air, he's the guy who could do it," Turner 
said. "And yet, here he is, down on the ground with the rest of us, pushing and 
shoving and kicking to get one more ring, one more play, one more break." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter, it comes. Bradshaw, hoping to thread the 
needle and sew up the game, underthrows Swann. Turner steps in front of the 
pass at the San Francisco 22, and what follows is vintage Montana, made all the 
more remarkable by its familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve plays, 78 yards. Seven attempts, six completions. It could be a high 
school game in Pennsylvania, a college game in South Bend, a playoff game on 
the frozen tundra of the North, a Super Bowl on a sweltering night in the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
Even the punctuation is the same: Rice, 25-yard pass from Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at him from the sidelines and you're almost in awe," Seifert said. 
"You find yourself watching him like a fan would." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 23, Pittsburgh 19. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I don't know at what point we started feeling this way, but there came a point 
with our team that we knew we weren't going to be stopped. It's not like you 
can pinpoint a single play or even a single game, but at some point I think all 
of us knew, or started believing, that any one of us could step forward and be 
a leader," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like they were nominated or anything. We just knew that whatever we 
needed, one of us had," he said. "Sometimes, it got so tough that I didn't want 
to pay the price individually. But I would never let down because of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at his own 20 with 4:53 remaining, Bradshaw circulates the 
nominations. Bleier catches his fifth pass of the day, an eight-yard screen, 
then Harris runs out of bounds after six more. Small fires are flaring all over 
the field, and Randy Grossman ignites the biggest of the drive by sliding into 
the vacant zone underneath Stallworth for 19 yards to the 49ers' 13-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
From there, with 1:12 left, Harris breaks the 100-yard barrier and the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I liked most about our teams," Franco Harris recalled, "was 
that once we tasted success, we couldn't be satisfied with anything else. Once 
wasn't enough. Two, three, even four times wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
But there is little celebration on the one sideline because of the man standing 
next to Seifert on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 26, San Francisco 23. 
</P>
<P>
 After a touchback, Montana brings the 49ers onto the field with an eerie calm. 
</P>
<P>
"In the huddle," said Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche, who helped groom 
Montana while a 49er quarterback coach, "all the players can see are mouth and 
eyes. He gets respect with the inflection in his voice, in his eyes. Those are 
very primal moments, when the other players have the instinct of animals. A 
horse can tell in an instant if you're afraid, if you're a rider or not. Joe 
tells them he's a rider." 
</P>
<P>
Now, even the markers respond. Five yards, eight, first down. Twelve, three, 
six, six, first down. Pass to Rice, pass to Taylor, pass to Tom Rathman, pass 
to Rice, Craig sweep for four and out of bounds. An incompletion, Montana's 
first of the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Third-down-and-4 at the Steeler 18. Fourteen seconds left. Montana back to 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
"I lined up on the left, so my best rush was what we'd call a rip, trying to 
get underneath on the right side," Greene said. "If I got pushed too far out, 
I'd try to club my way back inside. I wasn't so much worried about my blocker 
as I was about getting pushed into a double team." 
</P>
<P>
"There's only a few around, but the guys with power and speed are always a 
nightmare," Harris Barton, the 49ers' right offensive tackle, said. "If you 
stop the bull rush, they run around you. And the great ones can feel almost 
instantly where you are and what you're doing and adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Greene does each in turn, notching Pittsburgh's first and only sack of the game 
and folding Montana up like a card table at the 21. Cofer drifts onto the turf 
with eight seconds left. Greene lines up over center. 
</P>
<P>
"Those few seconds before a final play," Greene recalled, "were some of the 
most thrilling of my entire life. For all the gut-wrenching anxiety they 
caused, the final part of the hunt, the getting-after-it is what I remember 
most. 
</P>
<P>
"The result," he concluded quietly, "was sometimes like an afterthought." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, torturously, the bird is in the air, tumbling, tumbling, veering and 
tumbling, landing wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh, Team of the Seventies, 26 
</P>

SUPER BOWL POLL; 
</P>
<P>
BAKKER HAS INSIDE INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Scripps Howard News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What do Arnold Palmer, Mike Tyson, Larry King, Zsa Zsa Gabor, John 
Wooden and Jackie Joyner Kersee have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: They all say San Francisco will win the Super Bowl. So do many others 
in the Scripps Howard Celebrity Poll. 
</P>
<P>
REV. JIM BAKKER, federal prisoner 07407-058: San Francisco 49ers. There are 
many reasons why I think the 49ers will win and here is a list of them: Joe 
Montana for starters, a great offense, Roger Craig, Tom Rathman, Jerry Rice, 
John Taylor. Plus a fantastic defense, Charles Haley, Keena Turner, Bill 
Romanowski, Ronnie Lott and Michael Carter is back. 
</P>
<P>
An overall great team! These reasons the 49ers should win are good, but I 
thought you wanted some "inside information." So I took a poll of some of the 
people here on "the inside," so to speak. The results of my survey was 
unanimous for San Francisco, with one exception -- a wise-looking Indian, 
wearing a red headband, when I asked the question, he got a far-away look in 
his eyes, and said, "Remember this and mark it down. Denver will win the Super 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
P.S. If you think a prison poll is not representative of society, let me give 
you an idea of the kind of people who are here. There are people here from all 
over the world, young and old. There are sports figures, doctors, lawyers, 
druggists, corporate owners, stock brokers, a sheriff, a mayor, U.S. 
presidential candidate, minister, even a professional writer (I don't think he 
is a sportswriter, however) and a few criminals. 
</P>
<P>
LOU HOLTZ, football coach: San Francisco 49ers. With Ed DeBartolo as owner and 
Joe Montana as quarterback, how could it be any different? 
</P>
<P>
JAMES EARL JONES, actor: Who's playing? I just got back from making a film in 
Thailand. I'll root for San Francisco. My patriotism has to do with where I am. 
But I'd rather play the lottery, that's my favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
ARNOLD PALMER, golfer: I'm a Western Pennsylvanian and I suppose I would have 
to stick with the 49ers. They have a lot of Western Pennsylvanians there, like 
Montana. His ability is something to be in awe of. I watched the last game, and 
you think of throwing passes, and he didn't hit them on either number, he hit 
them in the center of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE ROYKO, syndicated columnist: I just as soon it rained out. I don't like 
either team. I can't stand any San Francisco team. The thought of San Francisco 
winning it, you ruined my morning just asking me. I'm sick of San Francisco, be 
it the baseball team (playing) the Cubs . . . their baseball team played a 
bunch of worms in the World Series. If they win the Super Bowl, all we'll hear 
about is the two San Francisco teams and they're the team of the decade. I wish 
the old Pittsburgh team was playing them and then the Steel Curtain would take 
Joe Montana and make him into five pieces. And then Denver. Colorado and Denver 
and the Rocky Mountains and that wimpy singer singing about Rocky Mountain 
high. Neither team deserves to be champion. You can't find people in either 
city with dirt under their fingernails. They're effete cities. In all 
likelihood San Francisco will win it and I'll throw up. 
</P>
<P>
ZSA ZSA GABOR, former actress: Of course the San Francisco 49ers -- because Joe 
Montana is gorgeous. He can throw a pass at me any time. 
</P>
<P>
GENE SISKEL, movie critic: San Francisco will Do The Right Thing by 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
ROGER CRAIG, baseball manager: Naturally, the 49ers. They have Roger Craig. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE TYSON, heavyweight boxer: San Francisco is going to win because Joe 
Montana and Jerry Rice are too strong. 
</P>
<P>
DAVE BARRY, humorist: The University of Miami Hurricanes. Hey, they deserve it. 
They beat Notre Dame, which beat Colorado, and their only loss came against 
FSU, when they were playing without their starting quarterback, plus the sun 
was in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT STACK, actor: I think Joe Montana is the best QB that has ever played. I 
think the 49ers have the most complete team in football. John Elway is gifted 
and he does things other quarterbacks have never been able to do, the way he 
steps out of the pocket and runs around like a track star and throws across his 
body. Elway might surprise everybody and win it by himself, but I don't think 
so. I think the 49ers are one of the best teams in history. 
</P>
<P>
ANTON LaVEY, high priest, Church of Satan in San Francisco: The 49ers. Joe 
Montana has legendary ability without stereotyped stupidity and well-deserved 
pride without pretentiousness -- all winning satanic qualifications in my book. 
</P>
<P>
JIM BROWN, actor, former football player: San Francisco, based on the fact they 
have Montana, Rice, they have Taylor, they have the running back, what's his 
name? They have an offense that can kill you in a hundred different ways. If 
they don't win it, it's a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
RUSTY WALLACE, race driver: San Francisco because of their background and the 
fact the 49ers are on a roll. The score? It'll be a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
LEEZA GIBBONS, TV reporter: San Francisco because Joe Montana has great arms 
and he passes pretty good, too. 
</P>
<P>
PETE ROSE, former baseball player, manager: Everyone's going to pick the 49ers, 
but I think maybe they look too good. I hope Denver will win. I like John Elway 
and I don't want Denver to be the first team to lose four Super Bowls. I just 
hope it's a good game. 
</P>
<P>
EVANDER HOLYFIELD, heavyweight boxer: The Atlanta Falcons -- in 1998. I think 
San Francisco will win. They just have more tools to work with. They are a 
complete team. They can hurt you with the run or the pass. They have an awesome 
team. 
</P>
<P>
RENALDO NEHEMIAH, hurdler, former 49er: San Francisco will win. Until the 
defensive minds become as innovative as the 49ers continue to be, they will 
continue their consistency in dominating. The 49ers just out-think defenses. 
Their thought process is so complex that they can find a weakness in any 
defense and exploit it. 
</P>
<P>
DAVID KEITH, actor: There's no question of who's going to win -- that's not 
debatable. It's just a matter of by how much. Elway has the potential to keep 
San Francisco from covering the spread, but San Francisco will win the game. 
I'm as sure of that as I am of a Mike Tyson fight. I have zero feelings when it 
comes to pro football. It's just somethin' to do after church. 
</P>
<P>
LARRY KING, TV talk show host: San Francisco 45, Denver 7. A mismatch. The NFC 
is flat-out better than the AFC. The 49ers will breeze. 
</P>
<P>
JACKIE JOYNER KERSEE, two-time Olympic gold medalist: San Francisco 49ers. 
Montana and Rice are stronger than Elway and Johnson. I like Ronnie Lott, of 
course, because he was a Pac-10 player at SC . . . he's one of the best 
safeties in the game. The 49ers' offense is just too strong for Denver's great 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR ROBERTSON, former basketball player: If you look at everything in the 
papers, you think it's going to be the 49ers. If everyone is sharp, the 49ers 
will win. But, you never know, Elway could get hot. 
</P>
<P>
LOU PINIELLA, baseball manager: I have to go with San Francisco. They made it 
look so effortless against the Rams and against the Vikings. They've been there 
before, Montana's playing great and it seems like this team's on a mission. 
Plus, I'm in the stock market and every time the NFC team wins, the stock 
market goes up. If Elway has a big day and San Francisco makes mistakes, the 
game could be close. 
</P>
<P>
JACK NICKLAUS, golfer: I don't really have much of an opinion one way or the 
other. I think the 49ers are the best team in football -- most people feel that 
way -- but I'm a Dolphins fan and would like to see the AFC do well. I'll go 
with the Broncos for sentimental AFC reasons." 
</P>
<P>
HARRY CARAY, sportscaster: Denver, but I don't know if that's enough to win the 
game. If Elway has a hot hand, Denver ought to win it with the points. But I 
would have to take the 49ers, something like 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
AKEEM OLAJUWON, basketball player: San Francisco seems unstoppable right now. I 
don't see who's going to stop them. So I believe they will win. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN WOODEN, former basketball coach: I think the 49ers will win primarily 
because they have great balance on offense and defense. They're not a one-man 
team, but they have one great player, one of the best ever -- Joe I'd have to 
take the points and Montana. Denver has a great player also in Elway, but they 
don't have that great balance. I would pick the 49ers because of Montana, but 
Elway can score from anyplace at anytime. 49ers by 10. 
</P>
<P>
ROWDY RODDY PIPER, wrestler: I'm too busy wrestling to even think about the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
WHITEY HERZOG, baseball manager: Everyone thinks San Francisco is going to win, 
and I'm not sure they won't. The Broncos lost three of their last four in the 
regular season, although it's a lot different after you've clinched the thing. 
But the Broncos are better than they've ever been, on offense and defense. It's 
awful hard to go against Joe Montana, but I would take the Broncos and the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT HAMILTON, ice skater: I'm a big Bronco fan, but San Francisco is my 
second favorite team, so this is the ultimate heaven Super Bowl for me. It 
would be great if there's an upset, there've been so many blowouts. It's time 
for an upset. To have such a large spread, that's just embarrassing. It will be 
a one-point game in the fourth quarter, ending with The Drive, Part II. 
</P>
<P>
ROGER KAHN, baseball author: Oh, I think Joe Montana. When I was a kid, there 
was a saying: Never bet against the Yankees or Notre Dame. I just thought of 
that, since Montana's from Notre Dame. I think it looks as though San Francisco 
will win at least one of these postseason things. 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
BO DIDDLEY, musician: Who's playing? San Francisco and Denver, you say. I think 
they'll tie up. 
</P>
<P>
HANK STRAM, former football coach: In the Super Bowl, you can't win it all 
unless you have it all. Denver is a lot closer to having it than the last two 
times they went. They're a much better team. San Francisco should win because 
they have more ways to win, but it's ridiculous to think that Denver is not 
capable of winning. The key is having a super player like John Elway. It will 
be a much better game than people think. 
</P>
<P>
DARREN McGAVIN, actor: I have nothing against Denver or Colorado, but I just 
think the 49ers are too strong. They have a wonderful team. They are like a 
wonderful ballet, a well-rehearsed piece of theatre, a joy to watch. 
</P>
<P>
TONY La RUSSA, baseball manager: There's one statistic that points to Denver 
that I can't overlook. They beat the 49ers in 1988 and lead the series 4-2. I 
put a lot of credibility in that because it says the Broncos know they can win. 
But in a big game like this, the best team usually wins and that's the 49ers. 
The 49ers are playing for history and that will motivate them. 
</P>
<P>
JERRY MATHERS, the Beaver: The 49ers, because I went to school at Berkeley and 
I've been following them for a long time. They deserve it; I just hope they 
don't have another earthquake. It's the way they've been playing, and Montana 
is great. Denver's a good team, but they just don't have it. 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
TIM McCARVER, sportscaster: San Francisco. If the 49ers play defense half as 
well as they did against the Rams, it shouldn't be close. I think they'll win 
by at least 15 points. People talk about both teams' offenses, but I believe 
defense might decide the game. 
</P>
<P>
DR. JOYCE BROTHERS, psychologist: The San Francisco 49ers are almost unbeatable 
at this point. Most people talk about Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, but because 
they are so overpowering offensively, people forget the defense is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
People who worry about both offense and defense present a very interesting 
psychological situation . . . in word association with fighters, when 
responding to the word "knockout," it was the fighter who talked about defense 
instead of offense who won. Studies of people in general say those with a 
defensive attitude who want luck and who have alternative plans are the ones 
who are favored in life. The Broncos have a severe problem, from an emotional 
standpoint as well as physical. They are such an underdog at this point.

<P>
NO REASON FOR NFL TO BLOCK UNDERCLASSMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS O'TOOLE, SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slice through the rhetoric and ethical posturing over whether collegiate 
underclassmen should be allowed to play professional football, and this truth 
remains: There is no moral or legal reason to prevent them from pursuing a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
They have had enough restrictions placed on them while in the NCAA's grasp. 
It's time to take off the leg irons. The plantation system is out of style. 
</P>
<P>
Staying or leaving is an athlete's decision -- and ultimately his risk. He 
might be given bad advice by a money-hungry agent. It's a shame, but it is a 
risk connected with big money and big boys. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta agent David Ware, one of the most ethical of his ilk, is opposed to 
wholesale signing of underclassmen. But he is realistic enough to admit, "The 
player should have the option." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement that Alabama junior linebacker Keith McCants will turn pro 
could be the kickoff to a landmark year for this emotional issue. Reaction will 
be strong. Tide fans wanted Coach Bill Curry to leave, not the team's best 
player. Around the country, alumni will be livid as more and more underclassmen 
spurn dear ol' alma mater for cold, hard cash. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, 
rattling his public-relations sabre, may propose rule changes at the league 
meetings in March. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 underclassmen are said to be considering the move. Fewer than 20 
will go. It could be 50 or five. That's not the point. Everyone who wants to 
should have the right. That does not mean everyone who wants to is capable. But 
like everything else in a free-enterprise system, the market will take care of 
itself. There will be some successes and some failures. Other undergraduates 
will see how this crop fares. Next year, one or two might decide to wait 
because of the risk. But that should be their decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone will go," said Ware. "In baseball, there are a lot of guys who 
get drafted out of high school, yet they never sign a contract even though they 
could be getting paid. They decide to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Once a collegiate player establishes himself, he sees very few reasons to stay 
in college. Pro coaches argue players need time to develop. That may be true 
with linemen, but Barry Sanders looked plenty developed this season. College 
coaches argue players need a degree. Herschel Walker never graduated, but he 
has already earned something a journalism degree won't -- $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
A player can always go back for a degree if he wants. Few will. Again, that is 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
You can forget obligations to the alma mater. A football scholarship is for one 
year, renewable each summer at the coach's discretion. Players owe nothing 
more. Rare is the coach who wouldn't jump from his five-year contract for a 
better situation. 
</P>
<P>
College coaches can avoid the moral dilemma easily -- stop recruiting players 
with pro potential. Oh, but then the college doesn't win so the coach can't 
earn the credit that leads to a better job. 
</P>
<P>
Pro teams can avoid the dilemma by not drafting underclassmen. Oh, but then 
someone else will take them. 
</P>
<P>
Pro teams are not without risk. Top-level college talent sometimes mysteriously 
transforms into slop after a contract is signed. 
</P>
<P>
"A first-round pick is probably the most over-valued thing in pro football," 
said Gil Brandt, former Dallas Cowboy vice president. "The top six or so are 
usually very good, but after that, there's not a lot of difference." 
</P>
<P>
Research supports him. According to an NFL official, from 1985-88, 61 
first-round picks and 59 second-round picks started. According to a National 
Football League Players' Association official, only 26 of the 1990 Pro Bowl 
picks are first-rounders. Green Bay offensive lineman Tony Mandarich, taken No. 
2 overall last year, played behind a journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
This says NFL teams are paying too much for what they get in the first round. 
That is one reason the league proposed a wage scale for rookies. It is also one 
reason agents accuse the league of wanting a flock of underclassmen to jump 
this year. If it happens, first-round talent might be available for second- or 
third-round money. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, underclassmen should stay in school, earn a degree, marry a pretty 
girl, live in the suburbs and have 2.5 children. Too few players survive long 
enough in the NFL to run the risk of being jettisoned without the parachute a 
degree can offer. 
</P>
<P>
But this is far from an ideal world. Reality paints a different picture. If 
players like McCants have an opportunity to make their families secure, let 'em 
go.

BRYAN MURRAY: TIES TO THE WASHINGTON CAPITALS STILL BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM GILDEA, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now he watches the Washington Capitals on television. His wife goes to a 
Capital game and he stays home. He's taken up light jogging. He works on his 
car. He's thinking about painting his house. "I've got plenty of time," said 
Bryan Murray, sipping morning coffee in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
He'd rather be behind the bench where, of all people, his brother Terry now 
stands -- a switch that surprised both brothers and confounded the large Murray 
family and their friends in Shawville, Quebec, becoming the chief topic of 
conversation in the little hockey hub. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Gambrills, Md., Bryan Murray wrestles with life on hold; between 
phone calls from well-wishers, he misses the pressures, the joys, the action of 
coaching the Capitals. He'd welcome it all -- even if the pressures were 
greater than most had known. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a two-year contract," Murray revealed, putting down his coffee. 
He said he only had a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure a second season of coaching, he added, the Capitals would have had to 
advance beyond their division in this year's playoffs -- something they have 
never done. His mission had been clear and ominous: Make the playoffs and win 
at least the first round. Or else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we lost in the first round, it was probably a foregone conclusion," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we won the first round and went into the second round and played well and 
got beaten, then there would be a time period where we would talk about what 
was going on. It wasn't automatic that I was going to be out of here. But it 
wasn't automatic that I'd roll into another year of my contract." 
</P>
<P>
The second year was automatic only under one condition -- "if we got by the 
first couple of rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said his contract had been worked out with David Poile, the Capitals' 
general manager, who this week confirmed the coach's account. Poile also 
confirmed Murray's explanation that a two-year coaching contract had been 
announced by the team so as not to put added pressure on the players, or, as 
Murray put it, "so the players wouldn't be under the impression I was at the 
whim of them playing well or not playing well." 
</P>
<P>
"That is something we mutually agreed would be in his best interest," said 
Poile. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed the contract," said Murray, "it was very up front. 'Look, Bryan, 
it's going to be: If you win in the playoffs, great, you'll be here. If you 
don't win in the playoffs, in all likelihood we'll make a change.' " 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Murray set a course that he believed could lead the Capitals to 
unprecedented success -- as well as save the job he was fired from last week. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole planning," said Murray, "was for the playoffs. Adjustments were made 
for the playoffs knowing full well that when you go that route you're 
sacrificing a little bit during the regular schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Poile and Murray went to a much younger team this season. The shift, Murray 
believed, would pay off in April -- and the elusive May that has always found 
the Capitals golfing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what's frustrating to me, I guess," said Murray. "We made quite a 
number of changes. We gave up veterans like Bobby Gould and Lou Franceschetti 
and Peter Sundstrom. Bengt Gustafsson went back to Europe. We went with Rob 
Murray, Yvon Corriveau, Steve Leach, Alan May, Billy Houlder -- the idea being 
that they would grow from day one of the schedule to playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
"In a couple cases, these are very different type players than we have had, 
more able to withstand the grinding of playoff hockey. So the adjustment was 
made on purpose, to have a different type of team come playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate part of it for us was that (Rod) Langway, (Scott) Stevens and 
(Neil) Sheehy got hurt. As much as anything, they were the leadership on the 
team, the stability in the room that we lost when we gave up Louie and a Bobby 
Gould. Because you're not going to get a rookie to step up when you have a 
couple of injuries to your veteran guys, to be the mainstays, the guiding 
forces that Rod and Scott were. 
</P>
<P>
"So when we started to fall a little bit, we had a tougher time getting to the 
emotional level, getting the confidence level back to where it should be. It's 
not their playing necesssarily that you miss; it's their leadership, what they 
do for the team in the room." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, over the years, there was the never-ending need for a goaltender. 
Almost always, in Murray's tenure, the Capitals bowed in the playoffs to a 
"hot" goaltender. And even now, Murray believes the Capitals still need another 
goaltender -- one who can carry them a distance in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Don Beaupre has been fine," said Murray. "I was really very happy with 
him. Beaupre can play a role on the team. Bob Mason to me never really came 
back to the level he was at when he left here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think -- and we've talked about it for a long time in the organization -- 
for the Capitals to be real successful this year I think they have to add one 
more goaltender. It's got to be a good goaltender with the ability to win a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've come up short in that category. To be successsful in our league 
today, you have to have a top-notch guy in that net. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the goaltenders who played for the Capitals since I've been here 
-- Dave Parro, Pat Riggin, Al Jensen, Pete Peeters -- none of them has stayed 
in the National League or been successful in the National League after they 
left the Capitals. Peeters is the only one who stayed any time at all this 
year, in Philadelphia, and he can't win a game, it looks like." 
</P>
<P>
Clint Malarchuk? 
</P>
<P>
"Clint was a great regular-season goaltender, but we didn't think he was the 
answer," said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Bryan," Poile said, "we haven't had in our franchise history the 
goaltender that made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, 47, Capitals coach since 1981 and eighth in winning percentage in the 
history of NHL coaches, said he hasn't been approached by another team. He 
wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has his memories: Coming here and helping to turn around the 
franchise quickly; the Capitals making the playoffs the first time; a 107-point 
season; a Patrick Division title; playoff wins, excruciating playoff losses. He 
believes the "constant commentary" in the media that the playoffs are the 
"only" thing that count "adds tremendous pressure to management." 
</P>
<P>
But Murray is neither looking back nor resting on accomplishments. For the time 
being, he roots hard for the Capitals. When he can't get the game on 
television, he turns on radio. He finds that he has to know the score. "I still 
feel it's part my team," he said with a smile. "I've been here so long and I 
take such pride in the way some of the players have improved, and the way they 
played for me. So I hope Terry lets me share a little bit of that for at least 
the balance of this year." 
</P>
<P>
But if the Capitals are paying Bryan Murray off for the season -- a reported 
$175,000 annual salary -- he'd trade his forced inactivity to work behind some 
NHL team's bench. Hockey always has been his love and the pro game his life 
since he landed the coaching job with the Hershey Bears in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he left his hometown of Shawville to coach Regina in the Western 
Hockey League and ever since the younger Terry left home as a teen-ager to play 
junior hockey in Ottawa, the two brothers have been followed intently from a 
distance by the Murray family. 
</P>
<P>
Two of 10 children, they are the special pride of a town that for years has 
applauded their every success. Nowhere was the news of the Capitals' coaching 
change received with such deeply felt shock and mixed emotions as in 
snow-covered Shawville. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long road from Shawville for both Murrays. An English-speaking Quebec 
town of 2,000, Shawville is nestled in farm country near the Ontario line 50 
miles northwest of Ottawa. In winter it features endless banks of snow. Ice to 
skate on lasts until spring. 
</P>
<P>
Terry laced on skates at age 4, began playing games at 5. 
</P>
<P>
"After school, that was the thing to do," Terry recalled recently, having 
directed one of his first Capitals practices. "Just grab the hockey stick and 
skates and go play." 
</P>
<P>
One action spot was a neighbor's backyard rink that had boards and lights. The 
kids kept it swept clean. Fifteen to a side sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
They'd play in the street -- all ice, no traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday was the big day," said Terry. "You'd go down to the arena and you'd 
have your organized hockey." 
</P>
<P>
On Victoria Street, which leads into the center of Shawville, is a store with 
signs: "Murray's Automotive" and "Murray's Sports and Casual Wear." Two other 
Murray brothers work here, Bill on the sporting goods side of the building, 
Barrie in auto supplies. In this country, little is more important than having 
hockey equipment and a car that works. 
</P>
<P>
"Me retire from hockey?" said Bill, 42. "I haven't retired. I'm just not 
playing this year. I'll be back next year." 
</P>
<P>
A good defenseman who might have made the NHL himself had it not been for a 
broken wrist, Bill has kept close to the game, playing annually in an 
industrial league. The only reason he isn't playing this season is because on 
Oct. 1, when training began, he was finishing building his new house. "If I'm 
going to play, I want to be there full-time," he said. "We're a dedicated 
bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Murray, 81, instilled in his sons not so much the love of hockey as 
the "work ethic" they all speak of. He commuted to his work at the power 
company in Ottawa. With the snowstorms, the drives could be rugged -- but no 
more so than the 150-mile round trip Bryan took daily to Rockland, Ont., for 
two years when he coached the Rockland Nationals junior team. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Murray raised the five boys and five girls. The Murrays lived first on a 
farm, then in town. A rugged country woman, she never worried about the boys 
playing a rough game such as hockey. "It was better," she said, "than having 
them get into mischief, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Clarence and Rhoda, Bill and Barrie and their five sisters express the feelings 
Bryan said they held: "They're very happy for Terry and they're disappointed 
for me. They're prejudiced in the fact they felt the team acted a little quick. 
In turn, they know Terry's ambition was to coach and they're very happy for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
They're warm-hearted people in cold country. Every summer Murray returns to a 
cottage on a lake outside of town. His Gambrills home, in the woods, simulates 
his Canadian cottage. Another reminder of his roots is a painting of 
Shawville's narrow main street as it looked a few years ago, with one stoplight 
and the town hall with a flag on top and old signs along the block -- Dodge, 
Shell, Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Murray gets out almost every day, stopping at the coffee shop downtown 
where the conversation turns to his sons when he walks in -- unless the subject 
already is the Murray boys. The elder Murray always made as many of Terry's 
junior games in Ottawa as he could; he watches as many Capitals games as he can 
pull in. Most nights, he'll watch any hockey game. "It doesn't matter," said 
Rhoda, "who's playing." In this instance, the sons led the father to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
If Terry and Bryan never were pushed in any specific direction, they made the 
most of opportunities. In 1979, Bryan got his coaching break with Regina when 
it looked as if he would turn out to be a Shawville businessman with his 
brothers. "One year when I was playing at Pembroke Junior A," said Bill, "I 
brought Terry along for the experience. And he made the team." Terry was 14. 
</P>
<P>
Being eight years younger, Terry wasn't particularly close to Bryan when they 
were growing up. "When I'm 14 years old, I'm sure as heck not hanging around 
with a guy who's 22," said Terry. In fact, he had his brother for a teacher at 
Shawville High. Bryan taught physical education. "He organized everything," 
said Terry. "He left a big impression on me." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Bryan knew that his thoughts of a career in the NHL were daydreams. 
He'd watched the old six-team league on TV on Saturday nights. Even if he were 
a good enough skater, which he doubted, there weren't jobs. Before graduating 
from McGill University, he did the most practical thing: He went to work in a 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
Terry was 19 and in his third year of junior play in Ottawa, living in a 
boarding house with hockey players and still thinking of joining the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police, when it was pointed out to him by his coach that he 
might have a chance to play in the recently expanded NHL. At a St. Louis Blues 
training camp in Ottawa, he saw players he played against. Terry knew it was no 
idle dream that he could make this league. 
</P>
<P>
As the two brothers progressed along different routes in hockey, they grew 
closer. In 1982, they were reunited when Terry finished up 12 NHL season with 
the Capitals under his brother. Then he became Bryan's assistant coach for six 
years. They live near each other; their daughters are friends; they car pool. 
"We really grew together," said Terry. "We had a lot of conversations. A lot of 
dinners." 
</P>
<P>
Terry was in his second season as head coach of the Capitals' Baltimore farm 
team when Poile one day recently placed his almost daily phone call to him. 
What a jolt. Poile wanted him to replace his brother. Later, when Terry called 
Bryan he said: "First thing I said was: 'Bryan, I'm really sorry the way things 
have turned out for you. I just hope that everything works out real well and 
you land on your two feet.' He said, 'Hey, I had a good run at it and now it's 
your time.' "

SOUTHLANDERS ARE FAVORED IN SUPER BOWL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Local runners will compete for the top spot in the 12th annual Redondo Beach 
Super Bowl Sunday 10-K run and 5-K walk, beginning at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Today's 10-K is expected to attract one of the largest fields west of the 
Mississippi, including some of the state's best runners. It begins at the 
corner of North Harbor Drive and Portofino Way, near the damaged Redondo Beach 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The event used to end with a race around the pier, but this year it will end at 
Pacific Avenue. The south leg of the race has been lengthened to compensate for 
the loss of the pier run. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the course has been flat and fast. This year, promoters say, it 
will be even faster because several tight turns on residential streets have 
been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The only hill climb in the course is a 200-meter rise at Torrance Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The best places to view the race are at the turnaround point in the Riviera 
Village parking lot and along the Esplanade as the runners return by the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Musyoki, 22, of the Gardena Valley Runners is one of the favorites. He 
is one of the world's top 10-K runners. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to give Musyoki a tough race is Mark Conover, 29, of San Luis Obispo. 
Conover was a track All-American for Humboldt State. He won the U.S. Olympic 
Trials in the marathon in 1988 and competed in the Seoul Olympics. His best 
10-K time is 28:30. 
</P>
<P>
Favorites among the women are Annie Seawright, 23, of Hermosa Beach and Chantal 
Best, 27, of Santa Monica. Seawright has placed in the top 10 in this race for 
the last five years, the only woman to do so. Her best time is 33:11. Best's 
best is 33:59. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-K walk will begin at 8:15 and follow the same course up to the runners' 
halfway point at Catalina Avenue and Ruby Street. KEVIN LINDSEY

VALLEY BEATS MOORPARK, CLINGS TO 1ST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

This game could have been played by plastic surgeons -- it was nip and tuck all 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College held on to first place by defeating visiting Moorpark College, 
83-80, in a Western State Conference game Saturday night in which the lead 
changed hands 15 times. The score also was tied more times, 10, than Michael 
Jackson has had nose jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good game," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. "Both teams played 
well. They hit some shots at the end, and that was key." 
</P>
<P>
With less than a half-minute remaining and Valley leading, 77-73, Valley's Rick 
Garrick broke free for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"They got that break there, and that made a big difference," Nordquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Bruce Watson came back with a three-point basket to make the score 
79-76, but Garrick made four free throws in the last 16 seconds to protect 
Valley's margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a hard game," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that surprised me, that I didn't anticipate, was Sam (Crawford) 
being able to shoot outside on us." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, Moorpark's point guard, made a 35-foot, three-point heave at the 
final buzzer to finish with 25 points and five three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark never led by more than seven points, Valley never by more than six, in 
what was a crucial conference match-up for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (17-9, 7-1 in conference) won its first six conference games but lost at 
Santa Barbara on Wednesday and needed a victory to remain a half-game ahead of 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (16-8, 4-3) was attempting to bring front-running Valley back to the 
WSC pack as well as rebound from a loss Wednesday to Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only try to get the kids up for certain games," Stephens said. "We 
knew this was going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Valley led at halftime, 34-33. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them at half the difference was going to be on the boards, and Shelton 
(Boykin) and Shawn (DeLaittre) got us some defensive boards." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin finished with eight points and six rebounds. DeLaittre scored a 
team-high 24 points and grabbed eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how we got here, him being inside," said Stephens, who began playing 
DeLaittre inside more often at the onset of WSC play. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best game he's had." 
</P>
<P>
Garrick scored 13, and Cliff Barnes and Steve Ward each added 12. Valley's 
Andre Harrell finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Roger Thomas broke out of a mild scoring slump with 21 points. 
Watson made three second-half three-point shots for Moorpark and scored 15.

EL CAMINO SHOCKED BY MT. SAC -- AGAIN

El Camino College basketball players had a look of disbelief on their faces 
Saturday night. For the second time this season, the last-place team in the 
five-member South Coast Conference, Mt. San Antonio College, had beaten the 
ninth-ranked Warriors, this time 62-55. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently Mt. SAC has a better team than El Camino," said Warrior Coach Ron 
McClurkin. "They've outplayed us twice. They just played better than we did." 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties (6-17, 2-3) made nine free throws in the closing minutes to hand 
El Camino its third conference loss. The Warriors fell to 2-3 and 17-7 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ready to play," said Mt. SAC Coach Ralph Osterkamp, whose team 
defeated the Warriors, 60-58, in Torrance on Jan. 6. "I think we played very 
good. They played well, too, though." 
</P>
<P>
But not well enough. Only two Warriors scored in double figures, David Keeter 
and Jamal Ross, who each had 12. 
</P>
<P>
With 12:36 left in the first half, Mt. SAC took 13-12 lead after a 
three-pointer by Tony McGee. El Camino managed to break away to a 27-23 lead 
with 4:59 to go, but the Mounties surged ahead, 29-27, on Lamont Keller's 
10-foot jumper with 1:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Steve Leary, who was fouled by Mt. SAC's Scott St. Clair at 
the buzzer, sank two free throws to tie the score 29-29 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors fell behind in the opening minutes of the second half. With 6:13 
remaining, they trailed by seven after Mt. SAC's John Moses sank a pair of free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors cut the deficit to three, 53-50, on a Darius Dubose three-pointer 
with 2:30 left to play, but Mt. SAC's McGee drove into the key for a bank shot 
with 1:13 left to give the Mounties a five-point edge. 
</P>
<P>
Then Keeter fouled Moses, who sank both free throws with 58 seconds left to 
secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors host Pasadena at 8 p.m. Wednesday.

MATURE LARRY LOCKLEY GIVES EL CAMINO MORE THE 2ND TIME AROUND; 
</P>
<P>
JC BASKETBALL: HE ALWAYS HAD THE ABILITY. BUT WHEN BANNING HIGH'S LARRY LOCKLEY 
FIRST PLAYED FOR THE WARRIORS, IN 1986, HIS LIFE WAS OUT OF FOCUS. A STINT IN 
THE ARMY AND A FAMILY CHANGED THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Lockley couldn't ride the team bus to Norwalk for El Camino's basketball 
game at Cerritos. The thin and agile guard sprinted through the gym door just 
minutes before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
While his teammates warmed up, Lockley was at a hospital with his 21-month old 
daughter, Courtney, who suffered from a high fever. He also missed Monday's 
practice because her condition hadn't improved. 
</P>
<P>
Lockley is El Camino's best player and a star in the junior college ranks, but 
life for the 23-year-old now consists of more than basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He works full time as a security guard -- from midnight to 8 a.m. -- and he 
spends his free time, what little there is, with his daughter and wife, April. 
</P>
<P>
After the Warriors' game at Pasadena, where he led his team to a 85-74 victory 
with 25 points, Lockley went straight to work at National Technical Systems 
while the rest of his teammates relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was exhausted," he said, shaking his head, "but I lived through the night." 
</P>
<P>
He paused for a brief moment, tugged on his white L.A. Clippers cap and said: 
"I have to sacrifice a lot to play the game. I don't think (teammates) 
understand that. They should appreciate this time in their lives because it 
will never come again. I think they take it a bit lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Lockley's hectic schedule, which includes a 13-unit class load, makes his being 
the leading scorer for the Warriors that 
</P>
<P>
much more surprising. Three other players -- forward David Keeter, guard Frank 
Beatty and forward Michael Houck -- average in double figures, but El Camino 
Coach Ron McClurkin says Lockley is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely our best player in more ways than one," McClurkin said. "He 
can shoot, he can handle the ball and he's very quick. But he's also very 
mature, and he's got a great all-around attitude. I mean, the guy has a great 
work ethic and he's very unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
Amazing what two years in the armed forces can do for a young, hot-headed 
player whose talent, specifically his shooting ability, made him a standout 
among his peers at 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Army didn't convert him into a tremendous physical specimen, but it 
provided a major dose of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Lockley became a "real man," according to McClurkin who says there's a big 
difference between the player who earned all-conference honors at El Camino 
under Coach Paul Landreaux in 1986 and the one who's on this year's roster. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more poised and more patient," said McClurkin, who was an assistant under 
Landreaux for nine years before taking over the team last season. The simple 
truth is that he grew up." 
</P>
<P>
Lockley says he needed such a change desperately because his life, after he 
graduated from Banning High School in 1984, was full of instability. That year 
he earned all-Pacific League honors and accepted a scholarship to the 
University of Texas at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't blossom (in high school) until his senior year," said Banning 
Coach Gary Cain, an assistant at the time. "Then he was real impressive. He was 
a better all-around player than people gave him credit for." 
</P>
<P>
Before choosing to play at El Paso, Lockley took recruiting trips to the 
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, the University of Washington, Colorado State 
and the University of Colorado. He chose El Paso because several local high 
school players were on the team. 
</P>
<P>
After one semester, however, Lockley returned home to Carson, homesick and 
depressed. That's when he consulted former Banning teammate Mark Wade, who led 
El Camino to the 1985 state title and later, at UNLV, was considered one of the 
nation's best running point guards. 
</P>
<P>
Wade advised Lockley to play for Landreaux at El Camino, and in 1986 he did. He 
averaged 16 points a game and was named to several all-tournament teams, but he 
still wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I (had never been) put in a position where I had to work hard for anything," 
Lockley said. "I was rather shocked when I came here. I was shocked at how 
difficult basketball could be and how demanding Coach Landreaux was. He wanted 
me to work hard and I didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
Landreaux, now head coach at St. Mary's University, says there was never any 
question about Lockley's physical ability and performance. The problem, he 
says, was a mental one. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as an outstanding basketball player and an outstanding 
athlete," said Landreaux, who was an assistant coach at UCLA for a year before 
taking over at St. Mary's this season. "I mean, the guy had pro ability. With 
work, he could have played at any major institution. 
</P>
<P>
"He just didn't have his life together. He was young and unfocused. The problem 
with him was upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
So Lockley quit basketball, with the intention of never playing again, and 
spent the next three years in the Army, stationed in Boston and Germany. Last 
year, though, he resumed playing basketball, in an Army recreational league. 
</P>
<P>
And last fall he returned to El Camino to complete an unfinished chapter in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I learned in the Army," Lockley said, "is that you don't start 
something and not finish it. You don't run away from problems." 
</P>
<P>
But Lockley may run away from basketball. He is considered a Division I 
prospect, but he is considering not returning to college after El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"I would consider playing in the NCAA," he said, "but it's not a preoccupation 
in my mind. It all depends. I have a family. Right now I'm focusing on 
finishing this." 
</P>
<P>
According to McClurkin, UNLV, Cal State Long Beach and New Mexico have shown 
interest in Lockley. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, any coach in the five-member South Coast Conference will probably 
agree that Lockley is a big problem -- their problem. Pasadena Coach George 
Terzian says that despite an abundance of talented players, Lockley is El 
Camino's biggest asset. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing extremely well," Terzian said. "He's a great shooter and he 
always plays unselfishly. I really think he's smarter now. He takes more good 
shots and he penetrates into the key area better than he used to." 
</P>
<P>
That's why the 6-foot-2, 170-pounder took over Beatty's off guard position. 
Beatty, a 6-4, 190-pound sophomore from John Muir high, was a part-time starter 
last year who was supposed to start this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lockley says starting is not a priority. If sitting on the bench will help the 
team win, he'll gladly do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My goals are different than before," Lockley said. "It's important for me to 
do what I can to help the team win. Before I just wanted to score a lot. I was 
selfish. Now whatever this man (McClurkin) asks me to do, I'll do it, even if 
it's sitting on a bench. Before, I'd say: 'I'm not going to sit on anybody's 
bench!' " 
</P>
<P>
As the coach said, Lockley grew up, and El Camino is fortunate to have him a 
second time.

CANYONS BEATS OXNARD FOR 3RD WIN IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chalk up another win for the revamped College of the Canyons lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons reeled off its third consecutive Western State Conference victory since 
moving 6-foot-3 sophomore Aaron Clark from guard to center, emerging with a 
72-64 win over Oxnard on Saturday night at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Nick Sanderson led Canyons (11-14, 4-4 in conference play) with 
21 points and Steve Valenzuela added 17. 
</P>
<P>
"(Clark) adds a new dimension to our game at center," said Canyons Coach Lee 
Smelser, whose team started conference play 1-4. "He's quick and a good outside 
shooter. It helps bring the opposing center outside and opens things up inside. 
It was originally a desperation move, but it turned out to be a good coaching 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson is the leader in another area as well. The conference's top 
free-throw shooter, Sanderson was eight of eight from the line as Canyons 
converted 20 of 23 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons hit only one field-goal attempt in the final 8 minutes 36 seconds but 
sank seven of eight free throws down the stretch to preserve the win. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons led at the half, 44-42, but went on a 10-4 run in a 4:12 span to start 
the second half and open an eight-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars extended the lead to 11, 65-54, with 8:52 to play on Valenzuela's 
reverse layup off a back-door pass from Chris Dyer. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (12-11, 3-4) pulled to within six, at 70-64, but Sanderson sank a pair 
of free throws with 30 seconds remaining to seal the win. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Randy Carter, who came into the game with a conference-leading 
24.9-point scoring average, had 26 points and teammate Joe Daughrity 
contributed 15. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Allbritton, Steve Kelly and Clark, scored 12, nine and seven points 
respectively.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BASEBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
MATADORS PREPARING FOR PRIME TIME WITH HARD-HITTING SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The season is at hand, but it's the season that preoccupies Bill Kernen's mind. 
</P>
<P>
With his Cal State Northridge baseball team about to embark on its 1990 
schedule, Kernen, as he is wont, is thinking ahead to 1991 when the Matadors 
move from NCAA Division II to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to win and be champions, but our real goal is to continue to develop 
into a top-level Division I program," Kernen said. "I definitely feel that 
we're right on target to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
That was Kernen's credo from the time he took over for Terry Craven in the 
summer of 1988 through the end of last season, when the Matadors finished 
30-19-1 overall and 16-12-1 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. and 
just barely missed an at-large berth in the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is preparing for next season's jump by playing 21 Division I 
opponents this season, including USC at Dedeaux Field in its opener Tuesday 
night. The Trojans are ranked No. 1 in the nation by Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The ratings stuff is interesting, but at this time of the year, you're trying 
to get your feet on the ground and get ready for your conference schedule," 
Kernen said. "But I'd be trying to be too cool if I said it wasn't an exciting 
feeling to play them (USC), because those are the teams we're trying to jump 
into the deep end of the pool with." 
</P>
<P>
More than any other factor, injuries will determine whether the Matadors sink 
or swim this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge roster includes only 21 players, 10 of whom are pitchers. Once 
again, the team is dominated by freshmen and sophomores. There are just two 
seniors and one junior. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any depth," Kernen said. "If we get buried with injuries, we 
have big-time problems. It's kind of scary. Numbers-wise, it's going to take 
another year of recruiting to get things where they really need to be." 
</P>
<P>
What the Matadors lack in depth, they will attempt to make up for with 
versatility. Just about every player is adept at two or more positions. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Craig Clayton, who batted a team-high .314 last season, is perhaps 
the key player for the Matadors. Clayton played second base, shortstop and 
outfield and also pitched in relief. This season, he will join the starting 
rotation and will play another position on days he doesn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Other important returning players include shortstop Mike Solar (.289), who will 
miss the first four games while recovering from hernia surgery; center fielder 
Greg Shockey (.271); and third baseman Denny Vigo (.241). All are sophomores 
who were starters as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers include sophomore Scott Sharts, the Southern Section career home run 
leader from Simi Valley High who transferred to Northridge from Miami. Sharts, 
a right-hander, will be in the starting rotation and will play first base when 
he is not pitching. Eric Johnson, a freshman from Chatsworth, will back up 
Sharts at first. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sims, a freshman from Alemany, is the catcher and Scott Richardson, a 
freshman from Eisenhower, will start at second base. Freshman Andy Hodgins, who 
played at Simi Valley, will open the season as the team's starting shortstop 
until Solar returns. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore J. D. Haendiges, freshman Kyle Washington and Hodgins will compete 
for playing time in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a team with power," Kernen said. "We're going to be able to 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Kernen, however, is less certain about his pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys will be given opportunities," Kernen said. "There's a lot of 
questions left to be answered about roles." 
</P>
<P>
New Matador assistant coach Dave Weatherman, who pitched Cal State Fullerton to 
a national championship in 1979, will be responsible for a staff that figures 
to be anchored by senior right-hander Val Lopez (6-9, 4.15). Clayton, Sharts, 
freshman left-hander John Bushart and freshman right-hander Monte Jones are 
other starters. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left-hander Pierre Amado, sophomore right-hander Eric Spellman and 
junior right-hander Todd Denhart, a transfer from El Camino College, also will 
see action.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IN ENERGY, MORE OPPORTUNITY THAN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back to the future. Dire warnings are sounding again about imported oil. The 
Department of Energy said last week that within the next 20 years the United 
States could be dependent on imports for two-thirds of its oil supply. 
</P>
<P>
And William Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, underscored 
that message, saying in congressional testimony that "dependence on Persian 
Gulf oil will rise dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The implied threats were all too believable after December's bitter cold snap, 
when heating oil and natural gas were suddenly in short supply in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
But is the threat real? Are we in for a rerun of the 1970s, a long period of 
scarce energy and high prices? Should we prepare to line up at the gas pumps 
again and put on more warm clothing indoors? 
</P>
<P>
No, not really. The first consoling fact to keep in mind is that the United 
States remains secure in energy, with enormous and diverse supplies of coal 
(enough for hundreds of years) and natural gas (60 years' supply and possibly 
more). The nation will make a lot more use of its natural gas in the decade 
ahead, and possibly its coal also. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond this fuel or that, the ultimate consolation in energy is that 
something else always happens -- economics changes demand or technology changes 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, domestic oil is slated for a long, slow decline -- more than a third of 
U.S. production will vanish in the next two decades, the Energy Department's 
forecast says. But that's not necessarily a calamity. Either we will import the 
oil that we need, or something else will give us the equivalent energy. 
</P>
<P>
The big use for oil, after all -- accounting for one-quarter of all U.S. energy 
usage -- is motor gasoline. And it's a good bet that, for environmental 
reasons, cars are likely to be burning entirely different fuels at some point 
in the next 20 years. Perhaps we'll see electric cars, powered by electricity 
produced from natural gas or coal. 
</P>
<P>
That unpredictability is why gloomy forecasts of energy crises and attempts at 
energy policy so often turn out wide of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Recall Project Independence, proclaimed by President Richard Nixon in 1973 to 
encourage both conservation and production of oil to free us from dependence on 
imports. The policy wasn't wrong -- just irrelevant. Seventeen years later, we 
are importing as much as ever and will import more because the United States 
simply can't produce all the oil that it uses. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean energy conservation failed. Not at all. More 
fuel-efficient cars, lowered thermostats and energy-saving machines -- helped 
by microchip technology that wasn't even developed when Project Independence 
was declared -- have given the U.S. a much bigger bang for its energy buck than 
before 1973. 
</P>
<P>
For another example, take the fiasco of natural gas in the 1970s. Use of 
natural gas to produce electricity was restricted until two years ago by a law 
passed in 1978 at the height of concerns about energy policy. The thinking back 
then was that natural gas -- a versatile substance that can be used to make 
petrochemicals as well as heat homes or generate electricity -- was too good, 
and too scarce, to use in electric power plants. So the Industrial Fuel Use Act 
of 1978 restricted its usage, and electric companies cut back. But they did so 
just as drillers, spurred by 1970s high prices, found vast new gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting oversupply bankrupted gas producers, disrupted pipeline companies 
and generally added to the economic suffering of the Southwest in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And after all that, the Fuel Use Act restrictions were repealed in 1987 -- nine 
years after they were passed -- to relieve the oversupply and to give electric 
power companies an economic, clean-burning fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Technology, in the form of increased understanding and concern for the 
environment, has changed the energy equation again. Natural gas emits no sulfur 
dioxide and only one-third the carbon dioxide of coal combustion. That's why 
the Energy Department pegs it as the fastest-growing fuel of the 1990s -- and 
proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act could increase its market even more. 
</P>
<P>
New pipelines and expansions of old ones are planned to try to keep up with 
demand from the Northeast, and California will shortly need more gas. All of 
which spells rising prices and new wells drilled to increase production. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is still in the early stages of a boom," says analyst David 
Braunstein of Lovett Underwood Neuhaus &amp; Webb, a Houston-based brokerage 
house. But industry leader George Mitchell, of Mitchell Energy &amp; 
Development, says he'll keep his powder dry. Mitchell has been through booms -- 
like that of the early '80s that made him a billionaire in Mitchell Energy 
stock -- and busts -- like that of the late '80s that reduced him to a 
half-billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that too much of a boom in natural gas -- tight supplies and rising 
prices -- will only speed the day that technological breakthroughs make coal 
environmentally acceptable. The Energy Department says coal will replace gas as 
the growth fuel of the early 21st Century. Or something else will happen -- 
renewable energy, or nuclear may be perfected by then. 
</P>
<P>
The only confident prediction one can make is that change will continue -- and 
probably dire warnings will too.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / IRWIN L. KELLNER: REFORMS IN THE EAST WILL HELP 
WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN L. KELLNER, IRWIN L. KELLNER is chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is still too early to predict all the ramifications for the world economy of 
the rapid changes in Eastern Europe because so much will depend upon these 
nations' ability to implement difficult economic reforms over the longer term. 
However, these historic events have already had a major impact upon Western 
financial markets and should help the West in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most noticeable effect has been the emergence of the West German 
mark as the world's most sought after currency. Fueled by perceptions in the 
foreign exchange markets that the political and economic changes occurring in 
Eastern Europe will not only benefit the West German economy but could also 
result in even higher West German interest rates, the mark has risen 
significantly against the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen 
since the crumbling of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind the mark's rapid appreciation has been traders' 
beliefs that West Germany's strong links with Eastern Europe and the influx of 
immigrants from East Germany will spur economic growth in West Germany. The 
anticipated increase in consumer spending, employment, construction and 
investment is expected to keep West Germany's rate of real gross domestic 
product (GDP) expansion above 3% this year, following last year's 4%-plus clip. 
Indeed, West Germany's economic ministry has said real GDP could be boosted by 
an extra 0.5 percentage point in 1990, solely because of the effects of the 
700,000 East German and East European immigrants who entered the country in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the possible inflationary impact of the increase in domestic 
demand is expected to encourage the Bundesbank to keep a tight grip on monetary 
policy. At the same time, West Germany's fiscal policy will be more 
expansionary this year, because of the $14 billion in tax cuts that went into 
effect this month. This combination of a tight monetary policy and a loose 
fiscal policy will keep the mark strong. It was the recipe for the dollar's 
ascent in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While West Germany will be the major beneficiary of today's developments in 
Eastern Europe, given the special relationship that it has with these 
countries, other Western European nations will also gain from the Eastern 
Bloc's political and economic opening. For one thing, it will strengthen the 
ties among the 12-nation European Community, helping to make it a more viable 
and competitive economic bloc. Both West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
French President Francois Mitterrand have emphasized that closer ties with 
Eastern Europe in general and progress toward German unification in particular 
can only take place within the framework of a united Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize this point, moves toward monetary union were accelerated last 
month when the EC leaders agreed at their summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, 
to begin an intergovernmental congress in December that would revise the EC's 
founding treaty to accommodate the final stages of monetary union. What is 
more, to reconfirm France's commitment to a unified Western Europe, President 
Mitterrand agreed to abolish French exchange controls this month, six months 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
For another, some of the increase in consumer spending in West Germany that 
will result from the influx of East German immigrants should spill over into 
imports. This will help to reduce West Germany's huge trade surpluses with the 
rest of the EC. What's more, buoyant economic growth in West Germany will be 
extremely important to the performance of the world economy this year because 
it comes when a marked slowdown in economic expansion is anticipated from three 
of the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
A driving force behind the current global economic expansion has been the sharp 
increase in world trade. Political and economic reforms initiated in Eastern 
Europe point to further opportunities this year. In particular, the anticipated 
restructuring of the Eastern Bloc economies will require substantial inflows of 
capital goods that will have to be supplied by countries outside the region, 
thereby giving a new spark to world trade. 
</P>
<P>
The Western allies are relaxing controls on the transfer of high-technology 
products to the Eastern European countries that are implementing democratic and 
free-market reforms. This could mean hundreds of billions of dollars in orders 
for the information technology sector in Western Europe, the United States and 
Japan. Probably more than any other industry, computer and telecommunications 
companies in the West will be poised to benefit from the reforms in the East as 
their products will be critical to the modernization of the Eastern European 
economies. Over the next 10 years, Eastern Europe is expected to spend more 
than $130 billion on telecommunications alone. 
</P>
<P>
A major problem that will confront Western investors, however, is that 
countries in Eastern Europe lack the hard currency necessary to pay for these 
products. Tourism could be a potential source. While foreign travel to Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union has surged in recent months, most Eastern Bloc 
countries don't have nearly enough hotels to meet the demand. In response, 
several major hotel chains are building new hotels in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague 
and Moscow. But, according to many travel agents, even these projects won't be 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States may not stand to reap as many trade and investment 
benefits as some of the better-positioned countries in Western Europe, the 
ongoing reforms in Eastern Europe are not without some pluses. Perhaps the most 
significant advantage is that the end of the Cold War will bring to this 
country the opportunity to use the huge savings from lower defense spending to 
reduce Washington's budget deficit. This, in turn, could mean lower interest 
rates, greater investment and stronger growth in the United States in the 1990s 
-- important benefits in their own rights.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: WHY STOCK GURUS AREN'T PUTTING MONEY IN STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If actions really speak louder than words, then what Wall Street gurus do with 
their own money is a lot more important than any advice that they might scream 
into clients' ears. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, I called about a dozen financial advisers, economists and stock 
market professionals and asked them a simple question: How are you investing 
your own money right now? 
</P>
<P>
One said he didn't have control over his investment portfolios, so the question 
didn't apply. One didn't want to comment because he wasn't practicing what he 
was preaching; he wasn't allowed by his company's rules to follow the advice 
that he was giving clients. Another said he doesn't talk about his own 
investments because he's superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest were willing to talk. And if there was a common thread through 
their remarks, it was that they didn't trust the overall stock market now any 
more than the average investor does. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were investing in stocks were doing so either because they planned to 
hold their shares for a long time or because they thought that they could 
outsmart the market. Here are some of their comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I am working extremes," said David Leibowitz, a special situations analyst for 
American Securities Corp. "I am buying shorter-term municipal obligations." 
That is Leibowitz's conservative investment. 
</P>
<P>
But, with as much as 60% of his own money, Leibowitz said he's dabbling in 
special situation stocks -- his specialty. He's buying, for instance, stocks of 
companies whose asset values he believes are not adequately reflected in the 
current price of their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
All of Leibowitz's investments are in smaller companies. "That's where I am 
finding the greatest value right now. When the market does turn, these stocks 
will give me a greater bang." 
</P>
<P>
More from Leibowitz in a moment. But first, let's take the emotional pulse of 
the folks who spend their lives giving out advice. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 47% of newsletter writers were optimistic about the stock market's 
chances earlier in January. But now, according to Investors Intelligence -- a 
New Rochelle, N.Y., company that conducts weekly surveys -- only 39% of the 
newsletter writers are bullish. 
</P>
<P>
That survey gets about as close as you can to determining how influential 
market pundits are thinking these days. Yet even with the drop in optimism, the 
newsletter writers are still a lot more upbeat about stocks in their public 
comments than the average investor, who obviously has been frightened away from 
the equities market because of increasing volatility. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the assets in 
money market mutual funds have been growing much faster than the assets in 
stock mutual funds since early 1989. And, for the week ended Jan. 18, the money 
market funds recorded their sixth-biggest increase in assets ever. That could 
have been because the Dow Jones industrial average fell 71 points on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
But my little unscientific survey shows that the Wall Street pros I contacted 
-- when it comes to handling their own money -- are acting a lot like the 
average investor who has been opting for the safe haven of money market 
investments over riskier stocks. The pros are either forsaking the stock market 
altogether or, like Leibowitz, being very particular about the shares they buy. 
</P>
<P>
Leibowitz said, for instance, that he's also looking carefully for stocks that 
have been trading at low price-earnings ratios and low price-sales ratios. And 
his conservativism also has Leibowitz looking for investments -- such as master 
limited partnerships -- with yields that compare favorably to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't as aggressive with their own money. 
</P>
<P>
"For the money I have under my own management, I have 80% in cash," said Robert 
Nurock, a well-known market analyst and publisher of the Astute Investor 
newsletter in Paoli, Pa. "The other 20% is exposed to secondary and emerging 
growth stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Nurock not only thinks that the stock market is in a vulnerable position right 
now, but he's also worried about the economy. The economy's problem, Nurock 
said, revolves around interest rates: They are too high for companies with less 
than an investment-grade credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
And the weakening economy is making the stock market vulnerable to a 
correction, Nurock said. "Stocks are highly sensitive to disappointing earnings 
or even rumors of disappointing earnings," he added. He thinks that there is a 
risk of "significant declines" in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Nicoski, the market analyst at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, a 
Minneapolis-based brokerage firm, feels pretty much as Nurock does. "I have a 
lot of cash. But I have been dabbling in some secondary names," including a few 
health-care stocks, Nicoski said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoski, who relies on technical analysis of the market, believes that stock 
prices peaked in the middle of last year, even though blue chip issues 
represented by the Dow were still at record levels Jan. 2. "The Dow is not 
telling the true story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoski, also worried about a recession, believes that the stock market could 
go into a slump that would last for months. 
</P>
<P>
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Norwest Corp., is also being very 
conservative these days. He has 70% of his money in the bond market and only 
20% of it in the stock market. The rest is in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting an economic recession sometime this year," said the 
Minneapolis-based economist. That could lead to a plunge in stock prices, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But once stocks become cheaper -- maybe sometime later this year -- Sohn 
believes that it would be wise to invest in the market again. At that point, 
the mix in Sohn's personal portfolio will change to 55% stocks, 30% bonds and 
15% cash. 
</P>
<P>
Some pros, of course, can't resist the urge to invest in stocks any more than a 
journalist can resist checking out a fire. But even these pros said they had 
special reasons for sticking with stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mostly in equities," said Monte Gordon, research director for Dreyfus 
Corp., the investment company. Only 15% of Gordon's money is in tax-exempt 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he can take the ups and downs in stocks. "I'm a long-term buyer. I 
trade very little. When I buy something, I buy for two to three years," he 
said. Gordon added that he doesn't sell a stock because of what the market is 
doing. He sells it based on what that particular company is doing. 
</P>
<P>
Liam Dalton, a New York-based money manager whose clients include very wealthy 
individuals and celebrities, said he's worried about the stock market and so is 
"trying to be nimble." 
</P>
<P>
"Until the market calms down, I'm not committing any long-term capital," Dalton 
said. That doesn't mean that he has given up on stocks altogether. In fact, he 
has about 80% of his investment capital in the market and is recommending that 
clients do the same. 
</P>
<P>
But Dalton is not letting moss grow on any of his stock certificates. He's 
weaving and dodging in and out of the market, content with making profitable 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there is David Hale, chief economist at Chicago's Kemper Financial 
Service Inc. He's 100% into stocks. Stocks that will benefit from the changes 
in Eastern Europe. Natural gas stocks. Down-and-out bank stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't waste time on bonds. Bonds are basically passive," said Hale, the most 
gung-ho of the bunch that I contacted. At age 37, he feels that he's too young 
to be a passive investor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Man Who Doubts Recession Forecasts 
</P>
<P>
Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache Securities economist, starts his speeches 
these days by telling the audience that the United States will never have 
another recession. 
</P>
<P>
Yardeni admits that it's a way to grab an audience's attention. But he also 
believes his incredibly optimistic forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Yardeni said we won't have another recession because the country can't 
afford it. The nation's extravagant borrowing habits -- on the government, 
corporate and individual levels -- could quickly turn a minor recession into a 
depression. And so the government will avoid a recession at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a recession, it can turn into something meaner and uglier, also 
known as a depression," Yardeni said. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts aren't as optimistic as Yardeni on the government's ability to 
steer the economy away from a recession. They would say if a recession is 
coming, the best that the Federal Reserve Board could do is shorten it by 
dramatically reducing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Yardeni, on the other hand, believes that the Fed can -- and must -- avoid a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of bad loans in the economy today," even without the pressure 
of a recession, he said. "If the economy fell into a recession, either by 
accident or policy design, the number of bad loans could increase dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the economy will keep growing," he added. "If we do have a recession, 
I would (then) join the worriers who fear that there could be a real estate 
crash, which would hurt people's confidence and cause them to cut back on their 
spending -- which would make the recession worse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Were the UAL Rumors Purposefully Planted? 
</P>
<P>
Was Business Week duped by some wily traders into running a false takeover 
rumor involving UAL Corp.? 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street speculators and traders have been hurt badly by UAL stock in the 
past six months. So no one was surprised when, on Jan. 19, a seemingly credible 
takeover rumor about the airline company appeared in the conservative business 
magazine. The issue carried a Jan. 29 cover date but was available as early as 
the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
After all, options on UAL's stock that were expiring that day would be 
worthless unless the stock suddenly reached $165 a share. So it was not so 
surprising that UAL's shares rose $6.75 a share to precisely $165. The value of 
the options was saved. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the rumor -- about Marvin Davis making a new $250-a-share offer for UAL 
-- was apparently false. 
</P>
<P>
Caveat investor. UAL has other options expiring Feb. 16. So watch out for 
rumors around that time. 
</P>
<P>
Business Week sticks by the story.

RANDY LEWIS: IF YOUR MOVIE MOUTH RUNNETH OVER, PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB THE 
'AVIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the villains of this world, surely the worst, the most heinous, are 
those who wantonly assault anyone within their reach. Like gang hoodlums, 
afternoon TV talk-show hosts and -- the Movie Talker. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything more vexatious to the film fan than sitting down next to 
someone who starts squawking the moment the lights go down and doesn't stop 
until the IATSE symbol rolls up at the end? 
</P>
<P>
So I cheered when I read recently about the manager of an AMC theater in 
Washington who has decided to give these pinheads a one-way ticket back to the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not talking about the people who occasionally turn and whisper, "Excuse me, 
honey, I'm going to the restroom," or who quietly ask Aunt Bertha, "Shall I get 
the regular or the Trough o' Popcorn?" This diatribe applies to the hard-core 
abuser, the guy who has watched so many ballgames on TV that he thinks every 
activity in life needs a play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, man, did you see what Michael Douglas just did to Kathleen Turner? That 
was out-ray-juss!!! You know what I'd do if that were me? I'd go into her 
closet, you know? And take out every dress and run 'em through the washer on 
the wrong cycle, man. Yeah. And then I'd. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that a thorough psychoanalysis of Movie Talkers' personal histories 
might reveal that many of them, as tykes, happened to utter their first words 
in a movie theater. Whereupon Mommy and Daddy got so excited, were so 
overwhelming with their positive reinforcement, that they instantly ingrained a 
lifetime Pavlovian urge to speak in a cinema. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, though, the Movie Talker simply forgets that there is a difference 
between sitting at home in the Barcalounger watching "Jeopardy!" -- in which 
case vocalizing is required ("What are GROUND SLOTHS, you idiot! GROUND 
SLOTHS!") -- and being in a public place surrounded by the public. 
</P>
<P>
If I'm so sensitive, why don't I just stay home and rent a video? Thousands, 
perhaps millions, do. I have one friend who refuses to go to a movie theater 
any more because he gets too incensed by sitting next to some Jabberwock. But, 
as purists know, retreating to the couch is not an acceptable option: Nothing 
beats the experience of seeing a movie on a big screen in a first-class 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, unlike the no-nonsense manager of the AMC theater in Washington whose 
actions made the national wire services, the folks who run Orange County movie 
theaters don't consider talkers a problem worth addressing. 
</P>
<P>
An AMC official told The Times that there are no plans to institute similar 
policies here, because audiences at the chain's 24 theaters in Orange County 
are 70% "avids" (film biz talk for regular moviegoers) and talking in local 
theaters is "on the downturn." 
</P>
<P>
Well, that certainly wasn't the case at the theater I attended last week. True, 
it wasn't an AMC theater, but I don't imagine it makes a big difference which 
chain you patronize (or do the Movie Talkers stop and say "Gee, I don't seem to 
have much to say today -- guess I better hop on over to the Edwards!") 
</P>
<P>
As I sat waiting for the movie to begin, some lunkhead started reading along 
with the opening titles -- assuming, as do most of his species, that everyone 
else in the theater dropped out of school after first grade. 
</P>
<P>
The worst part isn't that talking during a movie is downright rude but that it 
interferes with my ability to appreciate the subtle craft that is the cinema. 
At one point I actually got so distracted by this pea brain's constant asides 
to his companion that I nearly missed the crucial plot twist where the giant 
sand worm ate the station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
I hate that. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, though, I stumbled across another news item: 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Westminster wants to find a more profitable use for the pricey 
Beach Boulevard site where the venerable Hi-Way 39 drive-in stands, and 
officials are talking about tearing it down. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that anyone caught talking in a walk-in theater be ejected, but 
instead of getting no refund -- as happens at that theater in Washington -- the 
offender could be awarded a pass to the drive-in! There, with his Yugo's 
windows rolled up, he could chatter away ad infinitum without bothering a soul. 
And by catering specifically to the Movie Talker, the drive-in will attract 
bigger crowds than ever, placating the theater owner, the city and the "avids" 
to boot. 
</P>
<P>
I don't hold much hope that the city will adopt this farsighted plan. But it 
might be worth talking about.DR, Steve Lopez

<P>
While many Orange County residents will be firmly entrenched in front of a 
television set today to watch the Super Bowl (kickoff is set for 2 p.m.), 
members of the Vietnamese community will be celebrating their New Year in the 
streets of Westminster. The Tet Festival, which began Saturday, features 
exhibits, entertainment and ethnic food. 
</P>
<P>
There will be carnival rides, dancing and a fashion show as well. 
</P>
<P>
This year's event ushers in "The Year of the Horse," and about 250,000 people 
are expected to attend. Officials say it is not unusual for celebrants in 
Vietnam to take the whole month off to usher in the new year. The local 
festival's purpose, they say, is threefold: to remind young Vietnamese people 
of their heritage, to share the Vietnamese culture with the Western community 
and to bring tourists to the Little Saigon section of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. today on Bolsa Avenue, between Magnolia 
and Brookhurst streets. The event is free and open to the public.

<P>
A lawsuit challenging the right of Irvine City Councilman Cameron Cosgrove to 
hold his council seat will be heard in Orange County Superior Court on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Claude M. Owens will determine whether a full trial is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that Cosgrove became a councilman illegally in July, 1988. 
In June, 1988, the voters approved Measure D, which makes it possible to force 
a special election of the third highest vote-getter in a city election under 
certain circumstances.

MORNING BRIEFING: EVERYONE IS AN EXPERT AT PICKING THIS GAME

You've heard the experts' Super Bowl predictions. Here is what some fans have 
to say: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Royko, columnist for the Chicago Tribune: "I don't like either team. I 
can't stand any San Francisco team. The thought of San Francisco winning it, 
you ruined my morning just asking me. I'm sick of San Francisco. If they win 
the Super Bowl, all we'll hear . . . is that they're the team of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"And then Denver. Colorado and Denver and the Rocky Mountains and that wimpy 
singer singing about Rocky Mountain high. Neither team deserves to be 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Wooden, former UCLA basketball coach: "I think the 49ers will win 
primarily because they have great balance on offense and defense. They're not a 
one-man team, but they have one great player, one of the best ever -- Joe 
Montana. Denver has a great player also in (John) Elway, but they don't have 
that great balance. I would pick the 49ers because of Montana, but Elway can 
score from any place at any time. 49ers by 10." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerry Mathers, the Beaver: "The 49ers, because I went to school at Berkeley 
and I've been following them for a long time. They deserve it . . . Montana is 
great. Denver's a good team, but they just don't have it. 28-14." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which state's high schools have produced the most players 
participating in today's Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Fast forward: CBS analyst Terry Bradshaw, on the possibility of a lopsided 
victory by the 49ers: "If a game's a blowout, I turn it off, and I know the 
public's like that. For instance, I watched about three quarters of the 
Denver-Cleveland (AFC title) game and then went fishing. I had my wife tape the 
Rams and 49ers, and when I got back and heard the score, I just threw it away." 
</P>
<P>
No wake, please: Porter Wharton, a public relations consultant who has been 
hired to coordinate Monday's "welcome home" events in Denver, on why a quiet 
reception will be held instead of a parade if the Broncos lose: "The 
organization has always appreciated the show of support from fans, but it's a 
very difficult situation for everyone after (a loss). The players are very down 
and very tired, and it's better to keep things low-key." 
</P>
<P>
Bumper crop: Jesse Sapolu, 49er center, on why linemen should enjoy greater 
longevity in the NFL than linebackers or running backs: "If you put two cars 
about a foot apart and ram them against each other time after time, and then 
you get two of the same kind of cars and put them 10 yards apart, and they ram 
each other full speed, I think the two 10 yards apart wouldn't last as long." 
</P>
<P>
Starting out small: How far has Mike Holmgren, the 49ers' offensive 
coordinator, come in coaching? He started at Sacred Heart High in San 
Francisco. Said Holmgren: "It's a small parochial school and I was helping out 
a friend of mine as assistant coach. We lost our first 22 games." 
</P>
<P>
Stare wars: The 49ers' Harris Barton on the difference between Coach George 
Seifert and Seifert's predecessor, Bill Walsh: "Bill was like Darth Vader. You 
never knew what he was thinking. He was always watching you. There were so many 
things he was particular about, like keeping your shirt tucked in and not 
cussing. There was definitely a dark side." 
</P>
<P>
Burning bright: Seifert on former Raider Matt Millen, now with the 49ers: "He's 
a leader. He's a Jack Reynolds-type player. He brings a certain pizazz and fire 
to the game. He's totally into football." 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure before business: CBS Radio's Jack Buck, who will cover the Super Bowl 
for the 10th consecutive year: "Doing the game on radio is more fun; doing it 
on television means more money." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Of the 94 players, 13 played high school ball in California, 12 
in Texas. The Broncos have eight former California high school players; the 
49ers have eight former Texas schoolboy stars. 
</P>

hang. And I enjoy hangs." GARR KLUENDER

AUSTRALIAN OPEN: LENDL WINS WHEN SWEDE DEFAULTS WITH INJURED STOMACH MUSCLE.

<P>
Ivan Lendl repeated as Australian Open men's champion Sunday when Stefan Edberg 
retired with a stomach muscle injury in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the Australian Open's 85-year history that a men's 
finalist has quit in the middle of a match. Lendl led 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 5-2 when 
Edberg told the umpire he could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg received massage by a trainer during the match and rubbed his sore 
muscles several times during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the greatest feeling to win in this way," Lendl said. "I hope Stefan 
recovers soon. It's unfortunate, but sometimes things happen this way. He 
carried on for quite a while and showed great courage. I hope we can come back 
12 months from now and slug it out till the end." 
</P>
<P>
The only other finalist to retire in mid-match in Grand Slam history was H. 
Roper Barrett, who quit after four sets against Anthony Wilding at Wimbledon in 
1911. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who was forced to retire from the Australian Open with a back injury 
last year after winning in the round of 16, was in obvious pain from the middle 
of the second set on. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer worked on him after the fifth game of the second set, when Edberg 
took advantage of four errors to break Lendl and put the set back on serve at 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg held and kept the set on serve, pushing it to a tiebreaker when he came 
back from 15-40 in the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
But after Edberg took the first two points of the tiebreaker, Lendl won the 
next six, including one on a double-fault by Edberg. Lendl won the set with a 
backhand passing shot that whizzed down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg double-faulted on the last two points to suffer a break in the opening 
game of the third set. He fought back three break points in the third game to 
hold after five deuces. But the injury was clearly slowing him and draining him 
of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl earned $200,000 and Edberg $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles final, Czechoslovaks Helena Sukova and Jana Novotna 
beating American teen-ager and singles runner-up Mary Joe Fernandez and partner 
Patty Fendick, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).

SKINS GAME TAKES TV TIMEOUT; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: OFFICIALS CALL SLOW-PLAYING FOURSOME OFF COURSE AFTER SEVEN HALVED 
HOLES. ENTIRE $450,000 STILL ON THE TABLE.

<P>
It has been said the Skins Game is a golf event strictly for television. 
</P>
<P>
The point was made clear Saturday in the first round of the third Senior Skins 
Game at Mauna Lani Resorts. After seven holes of the equivalent of a scoreless 
tie, play was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
A thunderstorm did not cause a halt, nor did a volcanic eruption. Television 
did. Because of a commitment to local affiliates news shows, NBC stopped play. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer will be 
competing for all of the $450,000 in the last 11 holes. Mainly because Trevino 
sank clutch putts of eight feet and 12 feet, there wasn't a winner through 
seven holes. The golfers will start on the 140-yard, par-3 eighth hole today, 
playing for $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
If someone had won on the sixth or seventh, there would have been no problem. 
But according to Barry Frank -- co-producer with Don Ohlmeyer of the show -- 
with $140,000 to be won on a single hole, they had to stop play. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, estimated at 4,000, booed when, after a long delay, the decision was 
announced. Part of the blame for the inability to play nine holes in the 
allotted two hours, was because of poor crowd control. Because of the long 
distance from green to tee, the fans often impeded the golfers between holes. 
</P>
<P>
The four golfers, who realize that TV controls the event, did not object to the 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make for an exciting start (today), with $140,000 at stake," Trevino 
said. "As long as we just keep on playing and don't stop after playing eight 
and nine, it will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino had said that making a putt to prevent someone from winning a hole put 
the most pressure on him. Both times, his putts prevented Nicklaus from winning 
skins. On the 416-yard, par-4 third hole, after Nicklaus rammed in a 22-foot 
putt for a birdie, Trevino halved the hole. It happened again on the seventh 
with $115,000 at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of them were my favorite putts," Trevino said. "They were downhill putts 
with a slight break to the right. I thought the putt on three might win the 
hole. I thought Jack had hit his too hard, but it banged against the back of 
the cup and went in." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus didn't seem upset because Trevino had taken away two skins. Instead, 
he marveled at Trevino's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just great golf," said Nicklaus, competing in his first event as 
a senior. "That's what this game's all about. I mean, I wouldn't have minded if 
he had missed one, but I give him credit for great putting." 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much of anything bothering Nicklaus these days. 
</P>
<P>
His back has been a bother in recent years, but exercise appears to have solved 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how good I feel," he said. "I can hit shots I was afraid to 
try for several years." 
</P>
<P>
An example was his two-iron second shot on the 510-yard sixth hole. Nicklaus 
cut the corner on his drive and had 211 yards to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a downhill, sidehill lie," Nicklaus said. "Until my back stopped 
hurting, I had not been able to make that shot. I went through the green on the 
fringe. My putt for an eagle was about 20 feet downhill. I read it to break 
right. It broke 1 1/2 inches left." 
</P>
<P>
Although Nicklaus came close to winning two skins, others also had 
opportunities. Trevino and Player missed short birdie putts on the 130-yard 
fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's best chance was on the 419-yard fourth. While the others had trouble, 
he was down the middle of the fairway, but he left himself a 25-foot putt for 
the birdie. Let him describe the hole: 
</P>
<P>
"Jack hit into the rocks, Lee was behind a tree, Gary was in the sand, and 
Arnie missed the putt." 
</P>
<P>
The format for the skins game makes each of the first six holes worth $15,000, 
the next six $25,000 and the last six $35,000. To win a skin, a player must win 
the hole outright. 
</P>
<P>
On most of the first seven holes, it seemed likely that someone would break 
through. Instead, the suspense continued to mount. That's why the fans were 
upset when the round was not completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the 10th skins game (seven on the regular tour)," Frank said. "We feel 
terrible about the fans, but all tickets will be honored (today). 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we ran out of TV time when no hole had been won. With 
that much money, we had to call a halt. We will start earlier tomorrow. If 
someone wins the eighth or ninth, we will show the hole in its entirety at the 
start of the telecast. Otherwise, we will just show the highlights." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, less than 3,000 fans were expected. But, in addition to tickets 
sold, Mauna Lani gave two tickets to each hotel guest and five to each owner of 
the condominiums on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The overflow crowd and the narrow pathways from green to tee slowed play from 
the start. There was also a long television break on the second hole. 
</P>
<P>
After it was decided to stop play with $140,000 at stake, Trevino turned to his 
peers and quipped, "Anybody want to play in for a twenty?"

'MILWAUKEE' PLAY DOESN'T WORK; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: MANNING GETS CAREER-HIGH 39 POINTS, BUT L. A. LOSES TO PORTLAND, 
118-115, FOR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE DEFEAT.

<P>
The Clippers are 1-1 with "Milwaukee," which is not to be confused with 1-1 
against Milwaukee. More than semantics are involved, too. This gets right down 
to thievery. 
</P>
<P>
It's a play the Clippers call "Milwaukee," named that because they lifted it 
from the Bucks. To be clinical, it's a cross-court lob pass to the off guard 
under the basket, who -- if all goes right -- should be open thanks to a double 
pick at the top of the key. It worked for the game-winning basket a week 
earlier against Minnesota, and it almost worked Saturday night against 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Almost. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning's pass with 2.8 seconds remaining and the Clippers trailing by a 
point was long, and itforced a wide-open Ken Norman out of bounds for the catch 
in a 118-115 loss to the Trail Blazers before 13,170 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We stole (the play) from Milwaukee," Clipper Coach Don Casey admitted. "Dave 
(Twardzik, an assistant) saw it on one of their games, diagrammed it for me on 
the board. We said, 'Yeah, it looks good.' He was open, wasn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Norman was. Manning, who made the same tough pass to Jeff Martin for a layin 
against Minnesota, simply threw too long, forcing Norman onto the baseline to 
catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who scored a career-high 39 points on 14-of-20 shooting, pleaded 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"I just threw a bad pass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Casey: "It was a hell of a play they executed, and it was just a little 
off-center. But I'll tell you, it's a hell of a pass to have to make." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were forced to foul quickly to get the ball back. But Terry Porter 
made both free throws for two of his team-high 27 points -- to go with 15 
rebounds -- with one second left for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather come back and fall short than just go away and come back another 
day," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, the Clippers -- who have their first four-game 
losing streak of the season -- did not disappear after falling behind by double 
digits. They lost Thursday to Houston by a point. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we can play competitively with anyone in this league," said Norman, 
who had 10 rebounds and nine points. "A lot of our games are going to go down 
to the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't look like it at the outset, as the Trail Blazers -- who moved within 
1 1/2 games of the idle Lakers in the Pacific Division -- built a 31-20 lead 
with 51 seconds left in the first quarter. The lead went to 13 points when they 
closed out the quarter with a layup by Danny Young. 
</P>
<P>
Portland held the cushion until the Clippers' 8-2 run late in the first half. 
Moments later, Portland's lead was cut to 58-55 when Manning scored from inside 
and converted the free throw for a three-point play with 2:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
It remained a three-point game for all but the final 1.9 seconds of the first 
half. That's when Portland, winners of six in a row and 12 of 13, got two free 
throws from Porter to lead, 64-59. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Benoit Benjamin had 10 points and six rebounds, en route to 21 and 17, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The 59 points were a good sign for a Clipper offense that has struggled the 
past week with two sub-100 point games in four outings. Still, other problems 
developed that made it tough to take advantage of a home game in the midst of a 
streak in which they play eight of 10 games away from the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
With his tendinitis in his left knee continuing to cause pain, Tom Garrick 
missed his second consecutive game and is not expected to dress Tuesday against 
the Lakers. He will be re-evaluated later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Norman missed the last two days of practice with the flu, giving rookie 
Jeff Martin his first start. Norman, however, played six minutes in the first 
half, and then opened the third quarter, when the Clippers (18-23) got even. 
</P>
<P>
Outscoring Portland, 7-2, to begin the second half, the Clippers tied the game, 
66-66, on Benjamin's tip-in of a miss by Manning. Moments later, they had their 
first lead when Drexler was called for goaltending on Gary Grant's layup 2:25 
into the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trail Blazers responded, taking a 93-86 lead into the fourth quarter. 
Manning had 15 points in those final 12 minutes, helping the Clippers pull 
even, 99-99, temporarily go ahead, and then tie it again, 115-115, with a 
baseline jump shot with 1:11 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (30-11) went ahead for good when Buck Williams made one of two 
attempts from the line with 55 seconds left. The Clippers had two shots -- an 
air ball by Manning and a miss inside by Charles Smith -- before they got the 
ball for the final time. Then came "Milwaukee," except that the pass went by 
way of Green Bay.

LANDRY FIRING IS STILL HAUNTING JERRY JONES 
</P>

<P>
Jerry Jones must be seeing Tom Landry in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
See Tom announcing a book deal. See Tom on television trying to imitate Willie 
Nelson. See Tom in the Professional Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Jones fired Landry, paid him $1 million severance, and martyred him to kingdom 
come. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner of the Dallas Cowboys has apologized until he is Cowboys blue in 
the face, but Landry keeps coming back to haunt Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Landry isn't going to let up on the shabby treatment he felt he received. And 
Jones is going to have to lump it until he can live with it. 
</P>
<P>
At every opportunity Landry reminds one and all that Jones should have handled 
things better. It's an offense against which Jones has no defense. The majority 
of the American sporting public and sporting press agrees. You don't gut-shoot 
a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Jones can't get away from Landry. 
</P>
<P>
If he watches television, Landry will be there with his new singing commercial: 
"Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be Redskins . . . You didn't think I 
was going to say Cowboys, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
Landry pops up out of a suitcase in the Quality Inn commercial and gives his 
best imitation of Nelson, who made the song a big hit years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to give me voice lessons, if you can believe that," Landry said. "My 
voice was too high and they had to get it down lower. I had to have me a coach 
to learn how to do that. They kept calling and calling so I decided to do it." 
</P>
<P>
If you'll notice in the commercial, Landry isn't actually playing the guitar. 
There wasn't enough time to teach Tom to pick like Willie. 
</P>
<P>
It's a smash commercial for which Quality Inn will be paying $700,000 each for 
30-second spots during Super Bowl XXIV between Denver and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fun thing to do," Landry said. "I'd sung in church a few times, but 
that didn't exactly prepare me for a commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Landry will be paid handsomely for the advertisement. It will run six figures 
by the time the residuals are registered. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Landry did a commercial, it was the American Express cutie in 
which he survived a saloon jammed with Washington Redskins. He got $50,000 and 
residuals that went over the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Landry, by the way, won't be attending the Super Bowl in New Orleans, although 
he has wonderful memories of the place. He won his two Super Bowl rings there. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be at the Hills of Lakeway in Austin, Tex., playing golf. Landry was on 
the Jack Nicklaus course at the Hills when he was told Jones was coming to 
announce Landry had been fired on Feb. 25 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides an occasional birdie, Landry will be celebrating some more big news in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he was elected to the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor just to be nominated," he said. "It shows they haven't forgotten 
me." 
</P>
<P>
A fact Jones has been reminded of every day since February.

LANDRY GOING TO CANTON, BUT DAVIS MISSES AGAIN;

Tom Landry, who coached the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years before he was fired 
last spring, was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday along with 
six former NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
But Raider owner Al Davis was denied enshrinement in Canton, Ohio, again, as 
were several of the finest players in the history of football, among them 
Raider quarterback Ken Stabler, Ram defensive end Jack Youngblood, and 
Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann. 
</P>
<P>
The only Californian elected was Ted Hendricks, the linebacker who finished his 
Raider career in Los Angeles. He moves into the hall with Miami quarterback Bob 
Griese, Kansas City lineman Buck Buchanan, San Francisco lineman Bob St. Clair, 
and two Steelers, halfback Franco Harris and linebacker Jack Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Selection committee members said that Davis, who was rejected for the fifth 
time in five years, consistently gets the support of well over 20 voters on a 
board that varies from 27 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
But under committee rules, six voters can thumbs-down any nominee, and the 
anti-Davis faction continues to hold the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
The selectors, who represent newspapers in each NFL city, are known for their 
unpredictable actions. In Saturday's election, for instance, they voted for St. 
Clair over Swann -- although St. Clair is a relatively obscure offensive tackle 
and Swann a champion who was the MVP of Super Bowl XX. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood and Stabler were voted down although their credentials are 
comparable with most of those elected. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970s defensive captain of the Rams, Youngblood was twice named the NFC's 
top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Stabler was the AFC's player of the year at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Swann, Stabler and Youngblood at least made the list of 14 who were voted on 
Saturday. Two who didn't were George Allen, the former Ram and Redskin coach, 
and Tex Schramm, the former Dallas president, who, many selectors said, both 
have impressive Hall of Fame credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Davis made the list of 10 finalists along with those elected and three former 
linemen -- Dan Dierdorf of St. Louis, Larry Little of Miami and Ron Yary of 
Minnesota -- and the Baltimore tight end, John Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposing Mackey denied that their votes were based on his record as a 
union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
As a Hall of Famer, Landry joins a list of coaches that includes George Halas, 
Vince Lombardi, Sid Gillman, Paul Brown, and others.

49ERS LOOK TO OVERLOOKED MCKYER FOR AID IN DEFENDING ELWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GLAUBER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Widely known fact: Midway through the first quarter of the 49ers' 30-3 victory 
over the Rams in the NFC championship game, safety Ronnie Lott came from about 
25 yards away to knock down Jim Everett's pass to Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Little-known fact: On the next play, Anderson ran another deep pattern down the 
right sideline and momentarily broke free. Everett delivered what appeared to 
be a perfectly placed pass, but it again was knocked down to prevent a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Who broke up the play? Hint: It wasn't Ronnie Lott. Try cornerback Tim McKyer, 
the 49ers' forgotten man of the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody hears about Lott's play, but I break up a bomb on the next play and 
people don't remember it," McKyer said. "I've made a few plays this year, and I 
get overlooked. But that's the breaks. I can't help what other people think." 
</P>
<P>
The chip on McKyer's shoulder has grown steadily, starting with a bitter 
contract holdout in training camp, a controversial groin injury, and his 
eventual suspension for insubordination. Since being reinstated Oct. 23, McKyer 
has been relegated to playing nickel back, while unheralded free agent Darryl 
Pollard has started at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Seifert said Friday McKyer will not start in Super Bowl XXIV today 
at the Superdome. But the coach hinted McKyer could play a more prominent role 
in the regular defense than in previous weeks. McKyer spent most of Friday's 
practice working with the starters. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll primarily be used more in the nickel package, but he has worked more in 
the base defense for this game than he has in the last couple of weeks," 
Seifert said. "Tim's an excellent football player, and we possibly will use him 
more in the game other than (in the nickel defense)." 
</P>
<P>
McKyer has been at the center of controversy since training camp, when he held 
out for the second consecutive year. He eventually settled for a two-year, 
$1-million deal Aug. 26, but repeatedly has asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
McKyer started at left cornerback in the regular-season opener but suffered a 
groin pull that limited him in the second half. He missed three games because 
of the injury and refused to play in a Week 5 game against New Orleans, saying 
that his injury was not fully healed. Team officials said three doctors had 
cleared him to play, and Seifert suspended McKyer for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Upon being reinstated Oct. 23 -- after attempts to be traded -- McKyer played 
almost exclusively in the nickel package, when the opposition lined up three or 
four wide receivers. Pollard played in the base defense as well as the nickel. 
</P>
<P>
McKyer apparently remains troubled over his treatment by the 49ers but has kept 
a fairly low profile during Super Bowl week, choosing to "no comment" all 
inquiries about his status. 
</P>
<P>
Does he want to be traded? 
</P>
<P>
"No comment." 
</P>
<P>
Does he think he will be with the 49ers next year? 
</P>
<P>
"No comment." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert has other concerns besides McKyer's state of mind, particularly Denver 
quarterback John Elway. Seifert is willing to overlook McKyer's previous 
emotional flare-ups to give the 49er secondary the best chance to contain 
Elway, so McKyer has an opportunity to play a major role. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert said the key to containing Elway is maintaining good coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"People will drop their coverage (against Elway)," Seifert said. "They'll tend 
to look in the backfield to see what John's doing. They'll drop their coverage 
and leave a wide receiver open. It's up to us to stay disciplined in our 
coverage and try to continually pressure him."

TROJANS LOSE TRACK OF TIME IN LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
USC: NOBODY ASKS OFFICIALS TO STOP THE CLOCK AFTER OREGON TAKES 66-65 LEAD WITH 
FOUR SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
USC's basketball team should devote part of its workouts next week to 
practicing how to call time out. 
</P>
<P>
This is how it's done: You extend one hand and put the other hand on top to 
form a "T." 
</P>
<P>
Got that, guys? 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' inability to call a timeout after Oregon guard Terrell Brandon 
made an eight-foot jumper with four seconds left cost them a 66-65 loss to the 
Ducks Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
USC didn't have a clue on the final play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Trojans had one timeout remaining, it was wasted after Brandon 
made the game-winner. Forward Ronnie Coleman inbounded the ball to center Chris 
Munk under the Oregon basket, but the buzzer sounded before the Trojans called 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's sad that we didn't understand that all five players in a 
situation like that should be going to the official to call timeout," USC Coach 
George Raveling said. "I learned that in eighth grade in CYO ball. I would 
suggest that you certainly don't have to coach that at this level. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember my CYO coach telling me you always run to the official's face 
and call timeout. We should have five guys calling timeout. But we're a little 
gun-shy. We're like a guy in a rough neighborhood and a guy comes up behind him 
and puts his hand on his shoulder ready to say hello and he jumps and puts his 
hands up because he thinks it's a holdup. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not sure it would have made a significant difference. It would have 
given us one more shot. I think it might have given us a last-ditch chance to 
pull off a miraculous win." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' best option would have been to call time and set up a desperation 
shot by guard Harold Miner, who scored 20 points. That certainly would have 
been a higher percentage play that Munk dribbling out the clock to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Munk and Coleman said they were confused because of the din from the Oregon 
fans in the crowd of 1,478. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of noise in there, but I should have known better," Munk said. 
"I should have called a timeout regardless of whether the buzzer went off or 
not. It should have been an instant reaction on my part. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any excuses. I should have called a timeout regardless of 
whether time ran out or not. I should have called it anyway, even if there was 
.1 seconds on the clock I should have called it." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said: "I should have called a timeout at the end, but I didn't. I 
thought time had run out because there was so much noise in there I really 
couldn't hear whether (the buzzer) sounded or not." 
</P>
<P>
USC guard Rodney Chatman, who was at the other end of the court, said he tried 
to verbally call timeout, but referee Bob Garibaldi, positioned under the 
Oregon basket, said he didn't see anyone signal for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at Munk and Coleman and they didn't say a thing to me," Garibaldi 
said. "Afterward Raveling said to me that someone, I think Robert Pack (it was 
actually Chatman) called a timeout to one of the other officials at the other 
end. I went up and asked both of them and they both said 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, Raveling went after the officials at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Chatman is the only one who called timeout at the end," Raveling said. "He was 
near our foul circle. I can't blame the officials, even if I went after them in 
all of my emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Was Oregon Coach Don Monson surprised that USC didn't use its final timeout? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not too sure they didn't call it," Monson said. "I just don't know if the 
officials saw it or not. Apparently they didn't. I don't fault their kids at 
all. I think they were trying to get a timeout. At least, that's what my kids 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make a little bit more of that. The most they'd have had (to get off a 
shot) was three seconds and the ball's clear down in the back court. What can 
you do? Miracles happen but you've got to be realistic. The game was won or 
lost with Terrell's shot. The rest of it is speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 64-63, USC took a 65-64 lead when Calvin Banks tipped in a missed free 
throw by Miner with 1:16 remaining. The Ducks called a timeout with 58 seconds 
left to set up a play, but Brandon missed a jumper and Miner rebounded with 43 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon got another chance when Pack missed the front end of a one-and-one with 
31 seconds left. The Ducks ran the same play they did on their previous 
possession and this time Brandon made the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"They had designed a play for me to go one-on-one to take Pack who was guarding 
me," Brandon said. "And I buried the shot." 
</P>
<P>
And he buried USC (6-10, 1-8), again mired in last place in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
But Raveling hasn't given up hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever people's opinions, I'm going to try and stay positive and see if we 
can't turn this thing around," Raveling said. "I took an article out of the 
Boston Globe on the Steelers. They got beat, 51-0, in the first game and 41-10 
in the second and then they just kind of gradually worked their way back in and 
before you knew it they were back in the playoffs. I gave the kids that article 
to read because they have to understand that (the Steelers) had bad things 
written about them too and they came back. We have to find a way to turn this 
thing around." 
</P>
<P>
A good starting point to turning around the season might be working on learning 
how to call time. 
</P>
<P>

Trojan Notes

<P>
Kevin Mixon scored 20 points, hitting eight of 14 shots, including four 
three-point shots, to help Oregon (10-8, 5-4) win its first road game in seven 
tries. . . . After making 31 consecutive free throws, USC center Chris Munk 
missed one in the first half.

SIX MORE UNLV PLAYERS SUSPENDED FOR UNPAID PHONE BILLS

Six more UNLV basketball players have been ruled ineligible for one game 
because of non-payment of long-distance phone bills, bringing to nine the 
number suspended for a single game by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling by the NCAA Friday means that two players will miss each of the next 
three games, against Louisiana State today, Utah State on Thursday and North 
Carolina State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The six players are Stacey Augmon, Travis Bice, Chris Jeter, James Jones, Moses 
Scurry and Barry Young. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV officials have been allowed to select which two players will miss each of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon, the only starter among the six, has been suffering from the flu and was 
questionable for today's game anyway. He and Jeter were told at the airport 
Friday that they would not make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Starting guard Greg Anthony and center David Butler were ordered to sit out 
Thursday's Big West Conference game against UC Santa Barbara because of unpaid 
phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, guard Anderson Hunt was forced by the NCAA to sit out the 
Temple game because of failure to keep current on a student loan. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV officials say the long-distance calls were made from hotels where the 
Rebels stayed for games in Hawaii and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said they thought the phone charges were a matter between 
the player and the hotel. "Before all road trips, the university sends a letter 
to hotels at which the team will be staying, directing (the hotels) to shut off 
telephones to the student-athletes' rooms and to deny student-athletes room 
service and other incidental charges," a UNLV press release said. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently obtained records indicated that during the 1988-89 season, some 
hotels failed to enforce those rules; and that some student-athletes did make 
long-distance telephone calls and incur other incidental charges." 
</P>
<P>
The UNLV players stay two to a room, and the phone calls may have been charged 
by either roommate. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA declared both players in each room responsible and subject to the 
suspension because they did not know which player made the calls.

<P>
Syracuse left the Capital Centre a winner for the first time Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-ranked Orangemen used 36 points from sophomore Billy Owens and a 43-37 
rebounding edge to register a 95-76 victory over No. 3 Georgetown, their first 
in nine games at the Hoyas' Big East home court in Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"Not very many people win here so it was nice for us," Syracuse Coach Jim 
Boeheim said. "They won 27 in a row here and 111 of 122. We've come close a 
couple of times and today we played well throughout for 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Owens made 11 for 17 shots and also grabbed 10 rebounds as he bettered his 
previous career high by three points. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown still leads the series between the schools, 19-9, and is the only 
conference team with a better than .500 record against the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (14-3, 5-3 in the Big East), came into the game having lost two of 
three games, but this was its second game with guard Michael Edwards in the 
starting lineup, both victories. Derrick Coleman had 24 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We won it playing defense," Coleman said. "Sending everybody to the boards, 
even the guards, was a key." 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Mourning had 22 points for Georgetown (15-2, 5-2), which started the 
season 14-0 but has lost two of three. 
</P>
<P>
"You are concerned about everything after a loss, but we are 15-2," Georgetown 
Coach John Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Missouri 104, Colorado 89 -- Anthony Peeler scored 26 points and Nathan 
Buntin added 25 for the top-ranked Tigers at Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri (19-1, 5-0) helped itself by making 25 of 34 foul shots. The Tigers 
held the Buffaloes (9-9, 1-4) without a field goal for 6:35 and limited them to 
33% shooting in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 85, Kansas St. 57 -- Terry Brown scored 21 points and Rick 
Calloway added 16 in the Big Eight game at Manhattan, Kan., as the Jayhawks

<P>
Kansas (20-1, 3-1) took a 41-29 halftime lead and then made a 23-4 spurt in the

its archrival. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul 66, No. 4 Louisville 62 -- David Booth, a 6-7 sophomore, scored 37 
points to lead the Blue Demons to an upset victory at the Rosemont (Ill.)

won eight of its last 10 games.

Huery hit a layup to tie the score, 77-77, with 8:51 remaining. Mayberry hit a 
three-point shot to break the tie with 7:37 left, and the Razorbacks (17-2) 
never trailed thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Michigan 65, Michigan State 63 -- Rumeal Robinson showed again in Ann 
Arbor, Mich., why he's considered one of the best clutch players in college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
His overtime free throws against Seton Hall in Seattle won the NCAA 
championship for Michigan last spring. This time, Robinson's basket at the 
buzzer lifted the Wolverines to a Big Ten win over the Spartans, stretching 
their home winning streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The win pulled Michigan (15-3, 5-2) into a second-place tie with Michigan State 
(16-4, 5-2) in the Big Ten standings. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Oklahoma 109, Oklahoma State 92 -- The Cowboys were within 48-46 after 
scoring the first four points of the second half, but the Sooners (14-2, 3-1)

Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
William Davis had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Skeeter Henry added 22 points

</P>
<P>
Ohio State shot 65% in the first half and led, 45-42. But the Buckeyes (8-9, 
3-5) did not score again until Mark Baker made two foul shots after 8:45 of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Kaufmann's two free throws began Illinois' rally. Gill scored eight points 
and Stephen Bardo added five as the Illini (15-3, 5-3) made it 61-45. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Purdue 80, Iowa 59 -- The Boilermakers shot almost 75% for the game and 
the Hawkeyes missed 11 of their first 12 shots in the second half at Lafayette, 
Ind. The Boilermakers are off to their best start in the Big Ten since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Austin made four three-point baskets and had 14 points to lead Purdue, 
which pulled away as Iowa went the first 6:23 of the second half without a 
field goal and managed just one in over 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (15-2, 7-0), leading the Big Ten in shooting, made 17 of 21 
shots in the second half. Iowa (9-8, 1-6) made just five of 27 shots in the 
second half and shot 34.5% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Connecticut 72, No. 15 St. John's 58 -- Reserves Dan Cyrulik and John 
Gwynn combined for 24 second-half points to spark the Huskies to a Big East 
victory in the first game ever at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn., before a 
sellout crowd of 8,241. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's seventh consecutive win left the Huskies (17-3, 6-2) and the 
Redmen (17-3, 6-2) tied for first in the Big East. Malik Sealy led St. John's 
with 26 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Louisiana State 70, Florida 52 -- It took a while for Chris Jackson and 
the Tigers to get their timing at Baton Rouge, La., but once they picked up the 
pace, they coasted to a Southeastern Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who did not shoot for the first 14 minutes of the second half, led a 
21-2 game-ending surge. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (13-4, 5-3) broke a two-game losing streak. Florida (6-9, 2-6) was playing 
without star center Dwayne Schintzius, who quit the team last week. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 La Salle 98, Fordham 72 -- Lionel Simmons scored 16 of his 30 points in 
a 34-8 run to start the second half in New York as the Explorers crushed 
Fordham in a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game for their seventh

home. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Xavier (Ohio) 81, Butler 57 -- The Musketeers had to work hard for 10 
minutes at Cincinnati, but that's all. Derek Strong scored 15 points and led a 
23-5 surge in the final 10 minutes of the first half that carried them to a 
Midwestern Collegiate Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier (15-2, 5-1) used a tight man-to-man defense to hold Butler (3-15, 0-6) 
without a field goal in the final nine minutes of the first half.

<TEXT>
<P>
He was snubbed by the fans in voting for the NBA All-Star game, and Saturday 
night in Salt Lake City, Karl Malone sent a message on the court that he, 
rather than the Lakers' A. C. Green, deserved to be in the starting lineup Feb. 
11 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Malone scored 61 points as the Jazz handed the Milwaukee Bucks their worst 
defeat ever, 144-96. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was 21 of 26 from the field and 19 of 23 from the free-throw line in 
leading the Jazz to their ninth consecutive victory. He had 18 rebounds, three 
steals and two assists in just 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, the NBA's second-leading scorer and fifth-leading rebounder, was not 
voted as a starter for the Western Conference in the All-Star game. He 
threatened to boycott the game but said later that he would play if he is named 
as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a sense of pride, but I've had time to think about it and I think 
I will go if I'm asked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if he is not? 
</P>
<P>
"I can go to Miami, or I can go fishing in Louisiana. Right now, fishing in 
Louisiana sounds pretty good to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 61 points was the highest NBA total since Michael Jordan of the Chicago 
Bulls scored 61 against the Atlanta Hawks on April 16, 1987. Malone's previous 
high was 52 this season against the Charlotte Hornets. He is the 13th player in 
NBA history to score 60 or more points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-point loss surpassed the Bucks' 136-92 loss at Philadelphia on Nov. 16, 
1968 for futility. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 125, Washington 101 -- Charles Barkley had 29 points and 18 
rebounds and Hersey Hawkins added 28 points at Philadelphia as the 76ers won 
their eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has lost 17 of its last 18 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Malone had 22 points and Bernard King 20 for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 110, New Jersey 107 -- Michael Jordan scored 39 points and the Bulls 
held off a rally to win at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets got 29 points from Chris Morris and 20 from Purvis Short. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter but chipped away and tied 
the game, 101-101, with 2:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Scottie Pippen 19 seconds later put Chicago ahead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
New York 110, Denver 96 -- Patrick Ewing scored 12 of his 26 points in the 
fourth quarter and Charles Oakley had 25 points as the Knicks broke a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
New York, winning at Denver for the first time since 1984, never trailed and 
stayed a game in front of Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 85, Minnesota 83 -- Joe Dumars made his first basket of the second half 
with 1:40 to play, snapping a tie and lifting the Pistons over the Timberwolves 
at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion Timberwolves have lost nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 109, San Antonio 98 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 34 points at Seattle as 
the SuperSonics snapped a five-game losing streak with a victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle guard Sedale Threatt suffered a broken bone in his right hand and will 
be out four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 99, Houston 92 -- Derek Harper scored 21 points and the bench made a 
strong contribution at Houston as the Mavericks won their fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman and Roy Tarpley each scored 18 points for the Mavericks, who 
snapped Houston's 10-game home winning streak. Sam Perkins finished with 14 
points, including three in the final 38 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas bench outscored the Houston reserves, 36-6. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon had 32 points and 20 rebounds for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 114, Orlando 96 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 25 points at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone and Spud Webb each added 20 points for the Hawks, 4-0 against the 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Theus had 28 points for Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 91, Indiana 84 -- John Williams scored 22 points, including nine in a 
fourth-quarter comeback, as the Cavaliers rallied at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller made two three-point shots to help the Pacers to a 68-63 lead 
with 9:41 left, but Cleveland outscored Indiana, 14-2, over the next five 
minutes to go ahead, 77-70. 
</P>
<P>
Miller led all scorers with 28 points.

Brian Claar shot a four-under-par 67 Saturday to win the 16th Newport Pro-Am 
golf tournament by five strokes over Jeff Hart at the Newport Beach Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Claar had five birdies and a bogey Saturday for a two-day total of 133. He 
collected $10,000 of the tournament's $50,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
"My bogey on 11 kicked me in the butt and got me to play well," said Claar, 30, 
of Tampa, Fla. "I felt pretty solid all day, missing only two greens. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind came up in the afternoon and the course played exactly the opposite 
of how it played Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Claar took the lead by four strokes with a birdie on the par-four 16th. On the 
par-three 17th, his sand shot hit the pin and dropped five feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"When those things start happening, you know you're going to win golf 
tournaments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Claar's victory this weekend was his second of the season. He won a pro-am by 
seven strokes earlier this month in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Claar also has earned a spot in this year's Masters by finishing fifth in the 
1989 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, who tied for second in last year's tournament, struggled to a one-over 72 
for a total of 138, good for $6,000. His double bogey on the par-four seventh 
dropped him two strokes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The double obviously hurt a lot," said Hart, 29, of Solana Beach, Calif. "I 
just couldn't get it going today. I didn't hit the driver well or putt well. 
I'm glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
In the pro-am competition, two-time Newport winner John McComish and George 
Argyros finished in a three-way tie for first with pro Kent Kluba and Peter 
Foulke, and Hart and Michael Drucker. 
</P>
<P>
After matching cards, McComish and Argyros were awarded the top honors and will 
compete in the Tournament of Champions Pro-Am at La Costa next January.

FOOTE RESIGNS AS CHRB SECRETARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After ducking verbal brickbats from horsemen, state legislators and 
racing-board members, Len Foote has resigned as secretary of the California 
Horse Racing Board, about a year before his scheduled retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Foote's resignation, which takes effect at the end of March, was announced 
Friday at a meeting of the racing board in Monrovia. A board member, requesting 
anonymity, said that Foote decided to resign after a meeting with Henry Chavez, 
who recently became board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Foote nor Chavez could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Ferraro, another board member, said that the body hopes to name a 
replacement for Foote in the next 60 days. Dennis Hutcheson, the assistant 
secretary, will be a candidate, but board sources indicated that he would not 
get the job. 
</P>
<P>
A general shake-up in Foote's Sacramento office is expected. Among those who 
are vulnerable is Bob Chilimidos, the board's chief investigator. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, Foote became one of the most powerful figures in 
California racing when the board approved a resolution that gave him broad 
authority and enabled him to sidestep the board in making many decisions. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting, the board rescinded that authority, meaning Foote's 
successor will not be able to operate in such a free-wheeling style. 
</P>
<P>
Foote, who lives in Fair Oaks, served as the racing board's chief investigator 
from 1966 until 1976, when he was appointed board secretary. 
</P>
<P>
His office supervised California racing during an era when the state challenged 
New York for national supremacy. Last year, however, the sport in California 
drew the wrong kind of headlines, when Foote accused several trainers, 
including nationally prominent Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera, with running horses 
that had cocaine in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were dropped except for those against Roger Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who has filed a $25-million lawsuit against Truesdail Laboratories, the 
state testing facility which detected the cocaine, said Saturday that Foote was 
added as a defendant in the suit.

SUNDAY SILENCE SELECTED 1989'S HORSE OF THE YEAR

<P>
Sunday Silence finally beat Easy Goer by a mile on Saturday when the 3-year-old 
champion of 1989 overwhelmed his East Coast nemesis in balloting for horse of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The near black colt with the squiggle of white down his face received 223 of 
242 votes, based on a season that included victories over Easy Goer in the 
Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence also won the Super Derby, Santa Anita Derby and the San Felipe 
Handicap, losing only to Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes and to Prized in the 
Swaps Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, who owns Sunday Silence in partnership with Arthur Hancock 
and Dr. Ernest Gaillard, was also a lopsided winner of the Eclipse Award for 
top trainer of 1989. The Eclipse for the best jockey went to the record-setting 
Kent Desormeaux. JAY HOVDEY

PINCAY TO BE SIDELINED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH WITH BROKEN COLLARBONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in his Glendale mountaintop home Saturday afternoon, nursing his pride 
and a broken collarbone, Laffit Pincay was still wondering what went wrong 
Friday night at Los Alamitos Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay was injured in the last of three charity harness races when his pacer, 
Trixie Norton, stumbled and flipped at the start. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, 43, fractured his right collarbone and suffered bruises on his right 
hip and left leg. He has been fitted with an elastic shoulder brace and will be 
out of action for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a one-in-a-zillion chance," said trainer Roger Stein, who saw the 
Pincay spill. "He was in a jogging cart, which is usually very, very safe. I 
feel terrible about this because I was one of the people who checked the 
equipment before the race." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay said he sensed something amiss with Trixie Norton as they approached the 
arm of the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the horse go kind of weak," said Pincay, who had won one of the earlier 
races. "But then she picked it up again and was going all right. It was just 
when they started the race when she went weak on me again and stumbled." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay was flung into the air when Trixie Norton flipped and landed hard. He 
remained conscious, and by the time he was loaded into the track ambulance, he 
had a queasy feeling his collarbone was cracked. 
</P>
<P>
"I ought to know, I've broken it enough times," said Pincay, who remembered at 
least seven other similar injuries. "I could feel the bone had separated. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't need a month off now, either. I was feeling good and riding 
good, getting on a lot of runners. I was right there fighting for the lead in 
the standings, which is a lot of fun for me." 
</P>
<P>
Through Friday's Santa Anita program, Pincay was in a three-way tie for third 
in the local jockey race, six victories behind Gary Stevens. Pincay was also 
just a victory shy of Bill Shoemaker's all-time Santa Anita win total of 2,544. 
</P>
<P>
Of more significance, however, are the important races Pincay will miss the 
next four to five weeks. He was scheduled to ride Music Merci in the $500,000 
Strub Stakes on Feb. 4 and champion mare Bayakoa in the $300,000 Santa 
Margarita Invitational on Feb. 18. Bayakoa could also run in the Feb. 4 Santa 
Maria Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, Bayakoa's trainer, learned of Pincay's injury Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he was driving in a harness race," McAnally said. "There's 
always a chance something like that can happen. I'm a little surprised he was 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Lewis, who trains Music Merci, expressed similar chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard what he was doing, and I didn't like it," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has arranged for Chris McCarron to work Bayakoa a mile on the grass 
this morning. McAnally will wait until later in the week to decide whether or 
not to run the Argentine mare in the Santa Maria; but it can be assumed that if 
all goes well in the workout, McCarron will have the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also has a workout scheduled for Music Merci today, but as of Saturday 
afternoon he had not named a Strub Stakes replacement for Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Pincay's appearance at Los Alamitos with six other jockeys was a 
benefit for the Don MacBeth Memorial Fund, which aids disabled and financially 
needy riders. The fund was founded by McCarron, his wife Judy, and comedian Tim 
Conway, a horse owner. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is for sure," said McCarron, who was nearly knocked out of his sulky 
when Pincay's horse fell. "That will be the last harness race you see C.J. 
McCarron and Laffit Pincay in for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela returned from a five-day suspension to win with his first mount 
back, the $10,000 claimer Wilmont in Saturday's first race for Laz Barrera, and 
won the last race as well on Alabob's Pleasure. . . . Chris McCarron's four 
victories moved him to the top of the jockey standings, 28-27, over Gary 
Stevens. McCarron iced a four-winner day with a narrow victory aboard Fit to 
Scout in the $105,625 Santa Ynez Stakes for 3-year-old fillies. Fit to Scout 
outdueled Bright Candles, under Stevens, to win the 7-furlong event in 1:23 
4/5. The winner returned $10.60.

DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AT SOUTH COAST REPERTORY

Across the street from the Pacific Symphony's performing space at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center is South Coast Repertory, the county's other 
main, home-grown arts organization. Its reputation exceeds the Pacific 
Symphony's -- the theater received a Tony Award in 1988 -- yet ticket prices 
there for main-stage productions appear to be in line with other regional 
theater companies around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the current, acclaimed production of Howard Korder's "Search and 
Destroy" run $21 to $28. Prices for main-stage productions at the La Jolla 
Playhouse last season ran $18 to $25 (prices for the upcoming season have yet 
to be announced). At the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, tickets for the current 
production of "The Winter's Tale" are $18 to $29. 
</P>
<P>
At the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove, tickets for the current production of 
"Twelfth Night" are $16 to $20. Rick Vanderknyff

LOVE STORY TO TRAGEDY: A TOO-OFTEN-TOLD TALE;

<P>
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: A YOUNG ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN IS SLAIN BY HER EX-LOVER. IT'S 
NOT THAT UNCOMMON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Waiting tables on the last night of her life, Tammy Davis knew danger was on 
the way. Every few minutes, she would peer nervously out the big glass windows 
of Bob's Big Boy, convinced her ex-boyfriend would drive up with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old told friends that night that Brian Framstead, the man she once 
loved and the father of her child, had been demanding to see their baby before 
he began a six-month jail term. Frightened of his past outbursts, she had 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
At work in Huntington Beach that evening, Davis couldn't shake the fear that 
something bad was about to happen. She told a friend that Brian had access to 
guns. And she said, "If you hear any loud noises, it's me." 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour after she left work on Friday, Jan. 5, Davis was slumped on 
the porch of a nearby stranger's home, blood soaking her red, white and blue 
uniform. Seconds before the gunshot, she had pounded on the front door, 
screaming, "Help me! Help me!" 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Framstead was the chief suspect. He called his mother, 
hysterical, saying he had hurt Tammy and now he was going to have to hurt 
himself. As California Highway Patrol officers closed in on him 19 hours later 
in a parking lot near Victorville, he doused himself with gasoline, struck a 
match and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks, Framstead, 29, has lain silently in critical condition at San 
Bernardino County Medical Center, burned over most of his body, one of his legs 
handcuffed to the bed. A murder charge hangs over his head. The prosecutors 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
Anguished friends and relatives struggle in vain to understand how a love 
affair once bursting with "butterflies and roses," as one relative said, could 
explode into unfathomable tragedy. Reaching for explanations, they mention 
fights over money. Tiffs over the baby. Bad blood with in-laws. A 10-year age 
gap that made Framstead, perhaps, more eager to settle down than his teen-age 
love. 
</P>
<P>
But none of it makes sense of the ruined lives. Aware that Brian had been 
bothering Tammy, her friends and relatives had the sinking fear that something 
dreadful was coming. But some of Framstead's friends say violence was 
completely out of character for a man given to jokes and broad smiles. Others 
say he was a man in secret turmoil, on the brink of suicide, so fragile that he 
couldn't tolerate the rejection of the woman he loved and the separation from 
his baby. Some believe love made him obsessive, that he stalked and harassed 
his sweethearts rather than let them go. 
</P>
<P>
Framstead's parents, speaking publicly for the first time since the shooting, 
said they saw no signs that their son was veering toward tragedy until he took 
his roommate's shotgun on Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not my Brian that did that," Jackie Framstead said, choking back tears. 
"It was not the Brian I know." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Davis' closest friends declined to talk about it. Davis' mother, Debbie 
Armantrout discussed the tragedy briefly and reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just a young girl that didn't see the signs," Armantrout said. "This 
just feels like a bad dream. It's a nightmare and I won't wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Those who work with domestic violence cases are alarmed. They see a frightening 
trend: "routine" cases of bruises and blackened eyes are being replaced by 
broken ribs, burst spleens, fractured skulls, death. Each year in Orange 
County, more and more women seek protection from the courts and from police. 
But the safety those institutions offer has its limits. And so it is that women 
like Davis find themselves alone and in fear of the men who love them. 
</P>
<P>
Love bloomed for Davis and Framstead at Westbrook Lanes in Garden Grove, where 
he cleaned the alleys or worked the front desk. Davis, described as 
sweet-natured and vulnerable, had bowled there since she was a kid. Her mother 
worked the front desk. Framstead used to make Davis laugh. Their romance began 
in secret, since Davis, then almost 17, feared her mother's disapproval, said 
Brian Tramison, a close friend of Framstead who worked at the bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
Around her 17th birthday, Davis became pregnant. Friends say the two were 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I really saw a big change in him," Tramison said. "He was taking 
responsibility, taking care of her. He was always with her. He'd carry her 
bowling stuff and her coat and he'd open doors for her. He was never like that 
with other girls. They really seemed like they were in love." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Framstead said Brian "adored" Davis and was "ecstatic" about the 
pregnancy. Framstead's father, Dick, said he remembers the roses and stacks of 
love letters from Tammy that piled up in his son's room. Brian saved the 
flowers long after the blooms had faded. 
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, it was Tammy's time. The young mother found a way to name her 
daughter after the man she loved: Briana. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, things seemed fine. Davis, Framstead and Briana lived with Davis' 
mother and brother in the Garden Grove mobile home where she had grown up. 
Tramison said Tammy and the baby would attend Brian's softball games. But 
neighbors said a change came over the couple. Tammy seemed downcast and they 
heard quarrels from inside the trailer. "There was a gloom over that mobile 
home," said neighbor Rick Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling the young man (Framstead) was filled with all kinds of 
turmoil," said Ann Decker, the bowling alley supervisor who knew them both. 
"And here was a girl (Davis) struggling with so many stresses. I saw her 
vacillate between her fear of Brian, her love of Brian, the fact that he was 
the father of her child and that her family was strongly opposed to him." 
</P>
<P>
In late March last year, Davis and Briana moved in with her mother, who had 
remarried and was living in Stanton. A relative of Davis said she was furious 
because Framstead spent money irresponsibly and neglected Briana, charges 
Framstead's mother denies. Tramison said Framstead blamed himself for the 
breakup, believing perhaps he had spent too little time at home. 
</P>
<P>
Things took a turn for the worse on April 22. Davis went to the trailer to 
retrieve Briana after a visit. Framstead knocked her to the floor and strapped 
tape over her mouth, according to court documents. He later told friends he was 
desperate to reunite his family and just wanted to make her listen. He laid a 
gun on the table; she listened. 
</P>

A few days later, Davis obtained a restraining order keeping Framstead away 
from her and the baby. He was slapped with misdemeanor assault charges, and 
ultimately pleaded guilty to brandishing a weapon. He was to begin serving his 
six-month jail term Jan. 7, two days before Davis was shot. 
</P>
<P>
After that April confrontation, Jackie Framstead said, Brian "cried every day. 
He'd look at Briana's picture and just bawl." Framstead would say he didn't 
want to end up like his own parents, who divorced in 1970, Jackie Framstead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tramison said Brian told him later that he had planned to kill himself that day 
in the mobile home. "He was serious about it," Tramison said. "It really scared 
me." 
</P>
<P>
But Framstead seemed to pull himself together, his mother said. He began seeing 
a psychiatrist. By November, his spirits were up and he borrowed money for a 
deposit on an apartment for him and Tammy, hoping they'd reunite, Dick 
Framstead said. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' friends tell it a little differently. Tammy Hernandez, Davis' friend 
and her boss at a Santa Ana thrift store, said Davis was scared to leave her 
night-shift job alone because Framstead had been waiting outside for her one 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"He put her through hell," Hernandez said. "He wouldn't leave her alone." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Poynter, 24, dated Davis for a few months after she split up with 
Framstead. About 1 a.m. one morning last summer, Framstead tailed him as he 
left Davis' house, Poynter said. He forced Poynter's car into the left turn 
lane on deserted Beach Boulevard, walked around to the driver's window and 
demanded to know what Poynter was doing with Davis, Poynter said. When told 
they were dating, Framstead said, "You'd better watch out," Poynter said. On 
another occasion, Poynter said, after his car was parked in front of Davis' 
house for half a day, he found his fuel line sliced. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Benkowski, 27, who lived with Framstead for nine months before he met 
Davis, said that when she ended their relationship, she "couldn't get rid of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"He kept calling and coming over to see me whether I wanted him to or not," 
Benkowski said. "He'd show up at odd hours knocking on my door. Once when I 
went to work at 5 a.m. he was out there in his car, waiting for me. It was a 
little scary." 
</P>
<P>
But Jackie and Dick Framstead said they never knew of those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a happy-go-lucky kid with an easy temper," Jackie Framstead said. "He 
was a kind and caring person. He loved his family. If Brian was your friend, 
you had a darn good friend." 
</P>
<P>
But friendships can sour. Barbara J. Phillips, director of Community Service 
Programs, which administers the county's domestic violence assistance project, 
said that since 1982, the number of restraining orders sought in domestic 
violence cases in Orange County has increased 666%. Between 90% and 94% are 
filed by women. 
</P>
<P>
But only a few of those who need help go to court. Figures compiled by the 
state Department of Justice's Bureau of Criminal Statistics show that calls to 
law enforcement for help in domestic violence situations are increasing in 
Orange County and statewide. In 1987, Orange County police agencies received 
10,955 such calls for help. In 1988, the number rose to 11,265. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said court orders can offer only limited protection and cannot stop 
someone intent on injuring or killing. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim unfortunately has to take responsibility to see that it gets 
enforced" by calling the police, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials say the violence is worsening. One experienced judicial officer 
who sits in family law court said that at one point last year, the tension in 
family law court and in the hallway, where spurned lovers and battered spouses 
come face to face, "was so thick you could cut it with a knife." 
</P>
<P>
"It started happening more and more that I saw them walk out of court and knew 
nothing could protect them," the court commissioner said. Marshal patrols were 
stepped up in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Many who study domestic violence feel it is the reporting of the abuse, not the 
abuse itself, that is on the rise. Among them is Murray A. Straus, a sociology 
professor at the University of New Hampshire and a widely known expert on 
domestic violence. He said he "applauds" the increase in protective court 
orders and calls to police because it means women are taking advantage of the 
protections the system can offer. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports and friends say Davis was the one who reached out to Framstead 
for a reconciliation, calling in November and asking to see him. Framstead's 
mother recalls that he was "ecstatic," asking for money to put gas in his car 
so he could meet Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Tramison said it "seemed like the old days" again. Tammy and Briana were back 
in the stands at softball games and Brian sneaked off the field at every chance 
to give Tammy kisses, Tramison said. In a Christmas card, he asked his father 
to bless their upcoming marriage, Dick Framstead said. 
</P>
<P>
But things went awry around the holidays. Accounts on this period differ. But 
most agree a pivotal incident was New Year's Eve, when Davis told Framstead she 
was staying home. But then he found her at a party in a local motel room with a 
girlfriend and two male friends. He flew into a rage, reportedly tearing the 
screen off a window, Davis' friends told police. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after that, Jackie Framstead said, her son was disconsolate and 
felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Mom, I could never ever trust a woman again,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' sense of dread deepened. She quit taking his calls. Her mother has said 
she tried to contact Framstead's parole officer, without success. On Friday, 
Jan. 5, Framstead called repeatedly, asking to see Briana. When Tammy's mother 
got word of these calls, she left work abruptly, worried. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports say Jackie Framstead was convinced her son would kill himself 
that day when he left her house about 4 p.m., very upset, and saying, "Tell 
everybody I'm sorry." Jackie Framstead does not recall that now. She says the 
first sign of trouble came when he called around midnight, frantic, saying he 
had "hurt" Tammy. Panicked, she called Bob's Big Boy. A police officer answered 
and said Tammy had been in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
While the officer was still on the line, the operator broke through with an 
emergency call from Brian. This time, he said he loved Tammy and his mother, 
Jackie Framstead recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"The third time he called, he said he'd hurt Tammy and that it wasn't fair, 
that now he was going to have to hurt himself," Jackie Framstead said. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth time, he told her he'd left the gun in a flower bed near where Tammy 
was found and asked her to tell the Huntington Beach police where it was, she 
said. He also asked her to find out how Tammy was and said he'd call back. He 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept saying, 'I love her,' not, 'I loved her,' " she said, noting her son's 
use of the present tense. "I don't think he realized what he'd done." 
</P>
<P>
In his Inglewood apartment, Framstead left a four-page letter referred to in 
police reports as a suicide note. Jackie Framstead only read a small portion of 
it before police confiscated it, she said. It was signed, "Please forgive me," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Framstead's friends still don't understand what snapped inside him. They have 
their theories. But many, like Al Henry, 53, a lifetime friend, say it doesn't 
sound like the Brian they know. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a son to me," Henry said. "I think he was just overwhelmed by the 
love of the girl and didn't know what to do. It confused him. He was obsessed 
with her. He just wasn't the kind of boy who would do anything wrong. The 
family dream was what he wanted, to marry and settle down. Something just 
exploded inside him." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy's friends console themselves with memories. Poynter, her ex-boyfriend, 
said she was "the kind of person (who) could have a terrible day and see 
someone else who's down in the dumps and make them feel like things were OK." 
</P>
<P>
"She always saw the good in everything," he said, fighting tears. "One night we 
were driving and there was a full moon and she said, 'Look, see the smiling 
face on the moon?' I looked up and I saw the face. Now every time I see a full 
moon, I see that smile and I think of her."

PRISONS: NOTORIOUS PAROLEE IS IN OR ON THE WAY TO OAKLAND, ALAMEDA COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR SAYS HE WAS TOLD. CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS WILL NEITHER CONFIRM NOR 
DENY IT.

<P>
A Northern California public official said Saturday he has been told by state 
law enforcement sources that Charles David Rothenberg, released last week from 
prison seven years after setting his son afire, was paroled somewhere in the 
East San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata refused Saturday to identify his sources, 
who he said spoke to him on condition of anonymity. But Perata said in an 
interview that Rothenberg "is either on his way or has already arrived" in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
In its morning edition, the San Francisco Chronicle also quoted Supervisor 
Perata and an unnamed law enforcement source as saying they'd been "informed" 
that Rothenberg was either in or bound for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Perata admitted he has not talked with anyone from the state Department of 
Corrections, which oversees California's prisons and is shepherding 
Rothenberg's highly publicized parole. 
</P>
<P>
"These were people who were in a position of knowing," Perata said. "I'm 
convinced he's here. I was convinced (by Friday) because of the inquiries I 
made locally. If my information is wrong, I want to know from the state." 
</P>
<P>
However, Perata admitted that neither he or his sources were able to get a 
confirmation from the Corrections Department about Rothenberg's alleged parole 
to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Corrections spokesman Tipton C. Kindel would neither 
confirm nor deny Perata's assertion. But Kindel did say, "I read it (in the 
paper) this morning and had a pretty good laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Kindel added that only the top law enforcement official -- meaning a police 
chief, sheriff or constable -- in the area where Rothenberg was paroled 
Wednesday morning had been briefed on his whereabouts. Politicians, supervisors 
or City Council members were not among those notified, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not the first person to speculate on where (Rothenberg) is," Kindel said 
of Perata. "If he were positive, I think he would have said a little more than 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Police Chief George Hart could not be reached Saturday. Neither could 
Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer -- who also would have been told of 
Rothenberg's parole there. Plummer would not comment on Rothenberg's 
whereabouts in a Friday interview with the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
That newspaper quoted him saying only: "I don't like the system the way it is, 
but it is our system. You have to put these people somewhere. If people want 
this changed, they have to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 49, burned his son beyond recognition in a March 3, 1983, Buena 
Park motel fire. He said his wife threatened to bar him from visiting his son, 
David, then 6, so he tried to kill him. "If I couldn't have him, nobody could," 
he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 13 years, the maximum then allowed under state 
determinant-sentencing laws that have since been toughened. If he were 
sentenced today, Rothenberg could be been sent to prison for life. Because 
state law allows prisoners one day off for each day they work or go to school 
behind bars, Rothenberg's sentence was effectively cut in half. He did clerical 
and grounds-keeping work before he was released from prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage over his release has forced state officials, fearing a repeat of 
the Lawrence Singleton case, to keep Rothenberg's parole location a secret. 
Singleton was paroled after raping a teen-ager and hacking off her forearms, 
and citizens in several Northern California communities, enraged over his 
parole, drove him out of town. 
</P>
<P>
That cost the state $2 million for all the relocations, Kindel said. Singleton 
finally was housed in a trailer at San Quentin prison. It will cost the state 
$18,000 a month to watch Rothenberg in what are the strictest security measures 
of any parolee in California history. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg's victim, David, and his ex-wife, Marie Hafdahl, were out of town 
Saturday but said Friday they did not want to know where Rothenberg was. 
</P>
<P>
Perata, 44, is a full-time supervisor and former political consultant. He ran 
unsuccessfully for the state Assembly and has worked with state Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp on several issues, including outlawing assault rifles and other 
crime-related initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
He vowed to contest Rothenberg's reported parole to Oakland and stir up a 
public protest, including writing an official protest letter to the Corrections 
Department. He has already contacted different community members. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not your average, everyday crime. It's a monstrous act a father did 
upon his own son." 
</P>
<P>
Of the parole location decision, he said, "You don't see this happen to Rancho 
Mirage or Beverly Hills," referring to wealthy and predominantly white 
California enclaves. "They put these people in Oakland," which, he said, is a 
poorer city with less political clout. 
</P>
<P>
"They can damn well reverse their decision. This won't happen without a fight," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of police officers throughout the state have called the Corrections 
Department, some at the request of local reporters, asking if Rothenberg had 
been paroled to their community. Some of them, Kindel said, claimed they 
already knew Rothenberg was in their county but just wanted to know the 
specific town. This occurred even before Rothenberg was released Wednesday from 
an undisclosed California prison under heavy guard, Kindel said.

About $900 has been raised by employees at Bob's Big Boy restaurants around 
Orange County for the 21-month-old daughter of a waitress killed Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers collected the last of the donations last week, said Elliot Sousa, 
manager at the Huntington Beach Big Boy where Tammy Davis, 19, worked as a 
waitress before being shot just minutes after getting off work. The suspect in 
the case is Brian Keith Framstead, Davis' former boyfriend and father of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Half the $900 will go toward savings bonds for the child, while the other half 
was given to Davis' grandmother, who is taking care of the girl. SHELBY GRAD

LOYAL IOWANS REUNITE AS BOONE COMPANIONS

<P>
One man remembered taking baths in a big metal tub. Another man had skinned a 
skunk on his way to school and was sent home because he smelled so bad. A third 
stole watermelons for fun. 
</P>
<P>
These folks -- and about 150 other men and women -- gathered at Knott's Berry 
Farm on Saturday to remember the good times they had in the small Midwestern 
town of Boone, Iowa. They're part of a society formed in memory of the town, 
which boasts ownership of what they describe as the last steam engine train. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is a town of 12,000 people, a few miles east of the Des Moines River. 
Named after the youngest son of frontiersman Daniel Boone, the town began in 
the 1860s as a major train depot and a mecca for corn and soybean farming. 
</P>
<P>
The folks gathered together Saturday love the little town. In fact, the annual 
meetings have become so popular that "Booneites" flock from all over the 
country to attend. This year, one woman traveled from Maine just for the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy that this many people get together," said Jackie Bennett, who 
married an expatriate Boone resident. "I can't think of a town smaller than 
Boone." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jackie Bennett joined in with gusto as her husband, DuWayne, and 
other Booneites ate chicken and mashed potatoes at the Chicken Dinner 
Restaurant. As part of the ceremonies, they also sang the "Iowa Song," 
demonstrating how natives talk: "We're from I-oh-way!" 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that the Boone, Iowa, Society of Southern California started with 
a handful of families who, beset by unemployment, moved to California and kept 
in touch with one another through yearly get-togethers, said society president 
Arney Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition grew, evolving into the 76th annual event Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a small town with friendly people," DuWayne Bennett explained. 
</P>
<P>
Back when he grew up, playing hooky and sneaking off to the swimming hole or 
going fishing were leisure activities. For work, he detasseled corn and weeded 
bean fields. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to steal watermelon. That was entertainment back then," he joked. 
"There was never much to do in Boone." 
</P>
<P>
At age 17, he enlisted in the military and eventually moved to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the exodus landed in Southern California -- so many, in fact, 
that Bill Dickson, 74, at first believed Long Beach was actually called Little 
Iowa when he moved there during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson attended the luncheon to see lifelong friends. 
</P>
<P>
So did Ruth Wooten Hawes. The 73-year-old woman came all the way from Maine to 
see her long-lost friend from school, Louise Dorrance Sallows, also 73. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost track of one another and haven't seen each other for 57 years. We were 
best friends all through school," Wooten said. "Louise translated Latin for me. 
I wasn't smart like she was." 
</P>
<P>
"You did other things," Louise Dorrance giggled.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: A SOBERING STORY OF PROGRESSIVE PARENTS AND GRAD NIGHT FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just another phone call with a story idea, but it ended up affecting my 
life directly and very pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
The call came in June, 1985, when I was the education writer for the Orange 
County Edition of The Times. A pleasant, friendly voice on the other end said, 
"Hi, Bill. I'm Lori Warmington, and a friend suggested I call you about a story 
that's related to education." 
</P>
<P>
Inwardly I groaned. Feature story ideas about education are as prevalent as 
sand pebbles on the beach. Nonetheless, Warmington's call quickly became 
intriguing. "This is about parties three coastal-area high schools hold on 
graduation night," she said. "It's to make Grad Night safe -- without any 
alcohol or drugs. It's something we hope will spread to other high schools." 
</P>
<P>
I agreed to meet Warmington and some other parents of Newport Harbor High 
students who were building Grad Night party props in a vacant warehouse. The 
party theme for Newport Harbor that year was "Evening in Paris," and I was 
slack-jawed by the professional-looking Parisian street scenes being built by 
these enthusiastic parents. 
</P>
<P>
I learned from Warmington that Laguna Beach High, Corona del Mar High and 
Newport Harbor High had held Grad Night parties for several years. She was 
coordinating public relations for those three high schools. Later, I found out 
that Valencia High in Placentia was actually the trailblazer, having started 
Grad Night parties in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, only those four high schools in Orange County had Grad Nights. The 
concept involves having parents plan a year in advance for an all-night party 
for graduating seniors, to be held on the high school campus. The parents raise 
money for elaborate decorations, live bands, all-night entertainment booths, 
free food throughout the evening, and scores of prizes and games. 
</P>
<P>
High school graduation night, according to the California Highway Patrol, can 
be one of the most deadly. Celebrating seniors sometimes have fatal car 
accidents as they drive to or from parties, the CHP has said. Valencia High's 
Grad Night, in fact, was started by parents because one student had been killed 
and another paralyzed in a 1956 graduation-night car accident. 
</P>
<P>
At Grad Night parties, strict security keeps out any alcohol or drugs. But 
seniors I talked to said they didn't resent the rules because Grad Night was so 
much fun. "It's our last time together, and we really jam," said one graduating 
senior. "And, like, there's an incredible amount of food," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Warmington, like many other parents of graduating seniors, found it 
exhilarating to work on her son's Grad Night party, getting to know other 
parents and school staff better during the process. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to have this spread to all the other high schools in Orange 
County," Warmington said in 1985. When she found out I had a son who would 
enter Huntington Beach High School in the fall of 1986, Warmington said: "I 
certainly hope your high school takes up Grad Night. It would be a great 
present for your son, and, Bill, you can't believe how much fun it is for 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Warmington and another Newport Beach parent, Judy Hemley, co-founded the 
nonprofit Grad Night Foundation in September, 1986. The foundation, based in 
Costa Mesa, helps high schools start Grad Nights by giving them "how-to" 
instruction and guidance. Warmington said that 47 of the 65 comprehensive 
public and private high schools in Orange County will have a Grad Night this 
year -- compared to only four in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also spread to high schools in every county in California and to every 
state in the nation," Warmington said. "This week we got inquiries from Hong 
Kong, Japan, West Germany and the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the leadership of two parents at Huntington Beach High -- Allison 
Barsh and Pat Will -- that high school last year joined the growing ranks of 
those sponsoring annual Grad Night parties. My son Patrick was a junior last 
year, and I was among parents who volunteered to work for the first party for 
graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The experience -- as Warmington had predicted -- was great fun. I met scores of 
parents of other students, in all grades, who also volunteered. I saw bankers, 
accountants, airline pilots, regional business executives and police officers 
all working together in old clothes on many a Saturday. These parents painted, 
hammered, sawed -- and formed lasting friendships and closer ties to the high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is 1990, and my son is a graduating senior. I am again working on the 
Grad Night Committee -- this time very selfishly, as my son is among those who 
will be at the party. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I had the chance to thank Warmington and the Grad Night Foundation for 
their work. The story that I had covered back in 1985 has now become a growing, 
continuing, national phenomenon. And it is one of those stories that has 
personally touched and enriched my own life.

HEALTH LEADERS SAY INSURANCE PLAN IS GOOD MEDICINE; 
</P>

The issue was health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But as state Health and Welfare Agency Secretary Clifford Allenby told it, it 
also involved something he called "the gorilla behind the door." 
</P>
<P>
That was Allenby's descriptive phrase, used at a meeting with Orange County 
health leaders recently, for a new Deukmejian Administration effort to contain 
spiraling medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
As a regular member of the Orange County Coalition for Health Care Solutions -- 
a task force formed by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) -- Allenby 
was meeting with 19 local health leaders to share thoughts on problems such as 
indigent care and overcrowding in maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Allenby spent much of the meeting discussing a major statewide 
issue -- an innovative proposal by the Deukmejian Administration to require all 
employers to provide health insurance for full- and part-time workers, as well 
as their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal surfaced Thursday -- ahead of the Deukmejian officials' plans -- 
in a Los Angeles Times account. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still in Draft Form 
</P>
<P>
Allenby confirmed that story but stressed that the plan is still in draft form 
and not yet approved by Gov. George Deukmejian. He added that part of the plan 
calls for pumping an additional $600 million into the state Medi-Cal system for 
indigent care, the first increase in years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Medi-Cal money would increase, the plan seeks to limit sharp rises in 
the cost of private insurance or medical care with a threat -- or as Allenby 
calls it -- "the gorilla behind the door." According to the draft proposal's 
"Fail Safe Affordability" section, if the price of medical care rises above the 
Consumer Price Index by the program's third year, then anyone in the state will 
be allowed to join Medi-Cal, buying into it just as one would buy private 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
And if Medi-Cal expanded greatly, Deukmejian officials believe, their market 
power would be enormous in negotiating doctor and hospital fees. In addition, 
Medi-Cal would be competing with the private insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
Allenby emphasized that "bringing regulations or a commission (to control 
costs) just would not work. We call it 'the gorilla behind the door' because 
the gorilla is (this:) . . . we have Medi-Cal as the alternative if costs 
aren't controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian officials estimate 5 million Californians are without insurance. 
About 4 million of them -- mostly low-wage workers and their dependents -- 
would be covered by their plan, although the homeless, the unemployed, retired 
people and some disabled people and students would be left out. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, an estimated 160,000 of the approximately 400,000 county 
residents who now lack health insurance are probably not covered under the 
governor's plan, said Chauncey Alexander, chairman of United Way's Health Care 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O.C. Officials Respond 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County members of Bergeson's commission got their first glimpse at 
the governor's thinking on health coverage Friday. And they seemed receptive. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson described it as "a very bold new plan." And Tom Uram, director of the 
Orange County Health Care Agency enthused: "It's great for Orange County if 
this will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Expressing mixed emotions was Alexander. "We're delighted to have a general 
(Deukmejian) join the army of private citizens fighting the battle of decent 
health services," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
But he believes the Deukmejian Administration should "move to universal 
coverage," add stronger cost-containment measures and finance the plan from 
taxes. He added that he was speaking for himself; his task force's 45 member 
organizations still must review the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Also not quite sure was Mary Piccione, director of UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. She expressed concern that unemployed people were not covered but was 
pleased that there would be new money poured into the health care system. In 
all, she said, "there are some problems out there. But it's a hopeful new 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Also expressing reservations was Ellen Severoni, executive director of 
California Health Decisions, a citizens' health care group. "I applaud the 
decision to move forward," she said, but "we're never going to control costs by 
putting more money into the system in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
Allenby recounted the history of the plan, saying that Deukmejian made it clear 
last September that he wanted to tackle the insurance problem. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian made those remarks in a public signing -- one of only a handful he 
hosted last year -- when he approved a bill giving tax credits to small 
businesses that provide health insurance to their workers. "And the governor 
expressed that he was serious. He wanted something to address the problem of 
the uninsured," Allenby said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctor Shortage 
</P>
<P>
Though the proposal would add new money to the Medi-Cal system, Allenby 
acknowledged that "we have an access problem in Medi-Cal" -- that Medi-Cal 
recipients in Orange County and elsewhere in the state have difficulty finding 
doctors who will accept them. Also, he said, "we all recognize that Medi-Cal is 
underfunded." 
</P>
<P>
In other matters Friday, the Bergeson commission heard reports that there are 
not enough beds for indigent obstetric patients at Orange County hospitals with 
Medi-Cal contracts and the crowding may spill over to other private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Medi-Cal hospitals are currently delivering babies at 122.8% over 
capacity, a study by the Hospital Council of Southern California said. And 
there are indications, according to studies by both the hospital council and 
the March of Dimes, that all obstetrical delivery services in Orange County 
will soon be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Allenby agreed Orange County is facing a dilemma. "This could become a very 
significant problem with or without government support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hospitals and groups are seeking money from the state tobacco tax to 
build large "birthing centers," maternity facilities for low-risk mothers, that 
could handle 3,000 babies a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Russ Inglish, Orange County representative for the Hospital Council, said 
he isn't sure that these would meet the demand. "We're going to need to build 
two of these a year until this (baby boom) slows down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a representative of the state commission that selects Medi-Cal 
hospitals told the Bergeson committee that there was no problem. "Based on 
research, we really don't see a capacity problem in Orange County," said Hrant 
E. Kouyoumdjian, senior hospital negotiator for the California Medical 
Assistance Commission.

<P>
A Temecula man was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and manslaughter 
early Saturday morning after his car veered into oncoming traffic, striking and 
killing a motorcyclist, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Todd A. Drange, 30, was being held in Orange County Jail on Saturday in 
connection with the 2 a.m. collision in the 800 block of North Tustin Street, 
said Sgt. Bob Green. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was being 
withheld until notification of next of kin, Green said. The family of the man, 
a resident of Orange, apparently lives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Green said Drange was driving north on Tustin when he suddenly crossed the 
center divider. The motorcyclist, traveling south on a 1986 Yamaha motorcycle, 
was hit head-on and killed instantly, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was thrown quite some distance," Green said.

THEME PARKS TAKE A WILD RIDE TO CATCH DISNEY;

AND NEW ROLLER COASTERS ALL OVER ARE AIMED AT CUTTING INTO THE INDUSTRY LEADER.

<P>
It's a small world and it may be getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
If the nation's leading amusement parks are right, you soon will not need to 
travel far beyond Southern California or central Florida to explore the world 
of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
After all, outer-space aliens and Indiana Jones should be invading Disneyland 
at about the same time that Soviet and Swiss pavilions come to Walt Disney 
World. Universal Studios Hollywood will soon offer rides that travel Back to 
the Future or follow E.T. through the darkness. Patrons at Sea World in San 
Diego this spring should be able to feed bat rays and see sharks in a gigantic 
new Forbidden Reef pool. 
</P>
<P>
And those plans are only the beginning. Throughout the amusement-park industry, 
major players are gearing up to battle the acknowledged king of fantasy -- Walt 
Disney Co. -- for a greater share of amusement park patrons and their 
leisure-time dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The contest intensified earlier this month after the the company announced "The 
Disney Decade" -- a 10-year, multibillion-dollar plan to expand its theme parks 
in Anaheim and Lake Buena Vista, Fla., as well as its Florida resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The plans include development of two new theme areas at Disneyland, as well as 
scores of new rides and attractions at the 35-year-old park, plus a 
long-awaited, $1-billion, separate-admission theme park in either Anaheim or 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, described 
plans to build seven new resort hotels, 29 new shows and attractions and a 
fourth gated theme park -- rumored to be a Coney Island attraction or an animal 
park. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, the plans come as no surprise to amusement industry 
experts who have come to expect costly razzle-dazzle from the world's most 
successful entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is complete smoke and pixie dust," one Southland competitor 
sniffed. Without the two new theme parks on the drawing boards, the 10-year 
plan amounts to "nothing more than the standard improvements that go into 
Disney's theme parks every year." 
</P>
<P>
Other industry experts see it differently. The cute little mouse, to some, is 
starting to look more like a voracious rat. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is looking over their shoulder at Disney," said Nick Winslow, 
president of Harrison Price Co., a Torrance-based economic consultant to the 
leisure-time industry. "They're all very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as one tourism insider put it: "Disney sneezes and they all catch cold." 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms include a reassessment by most of the major amusement park 
companies of their long-range plans -- even though virtually all will not 
acknowledge concern. As Larry Cochran, president and chief executive of Six 
Flags Corp. of Arlington, Tex., put it: "Disney is Disney, and there's only 
going to be one of them. Nobody in the world can compete with Disney, unless 
it's MCA." MCA owns Universal Studios Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not stop everybody else from at least trying to keep pace with 
Mickey Mouse's company as it builds a better people trap. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's expansion plan is widely viewed among competitors as a clear signal 
that the company is not about to abandon its highly profitable Southern 
California park -- or let its grip slip on the increasingly important market 
near Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
It's small wonder. Nationwide, major theme parks bring in more than $3 billion 
annually, industry analysts estimate. Of the 253 million visits Americans made 
to theme parks last year, more than 44 million were to Walt Disney World and 
Disneyland, according to the International Assn. of Amusement Parks &amp; 
Attractions, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
For Disney, that means big bucks. Its theme parks and resort operations 
produced about 64% of the company's annual operating profits and 56% of revenue 
coming in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Net income for 1989 was $703.3 
million, up 35% from 1988, on revenue of $4.6 billion, up 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that success has come since 1972, when Disney almost single-handedly 
began building Orlando into a major tourist spot -- and Walt Disney World into 
the most popular vacation destination in the country. 
</P>
<P>
One key to Disney World's prosperity is that it gives customers lots of reasons 
to spend as much time as possible at its 6,600 developed acres of hotels, 
nightspots, restaurants, golf courses, water parks and, of course, theme parks 
-- the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and the new Disney-MGM Studio Theme Park. 
</P>
<P>
With an average length of stay at Disney property hotels slightly more than 
three days, more often than not "every penny that you spend goes into Disney 
pockets," one competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
To help ensure that flow, when its studio theme park opened early last year, 
Disney began offering four-day park passes -- $97 for adults, $77 for each 
child -- and eliminated three-day passes. That gives customers a tough option 
of buying one $30.65 pass for one theme park or plunking down the cost of a 
four-day ticket to all three parks. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's plans to build a marine-oriented theme park in Long Beach or a second 
gated park on 40 acres that the company owns near the Anaheim park could have a 
similar goal here, industry observers say. With a second park, Disney could 
easily increase how much time patrons stay at its Southland theme parks by 
selling four-day passes. (Disneyland now sells three-day passes at $66.50 for 
adults and $53.25 for children.) 
</P>
<P>
That means that "instead of providing entertainment for eight hours, Disney can 
provide hotel rooms, food, merchandise and everything that is related for 
several days," said Ray Braun, senior vice president with Economics Research 
Associates, a Los Angeles-based economic consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts are betting that is exactly what will happen -- assuming that 
Disney can solve the tough traffic, parking and other "infrastructure" problems 
that Eisner stressed must be decided before the second California theme park 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Times, Eisner promised a Disney hotel expansion 
-- offering a themed motif throughout -- if the plans for a second gate come 
true in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
While Disney's expansion presents a challenge, some Disney competitors see a 
bright side for them. They said the expansion of theme parks can only help 
everybody else, who will ride Disney's coattails. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything Disney does to attract more people to Southern California is good for 
all of us," said Stuart Zanville, spokesman for Knott's Berry Farm in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, at least some industry experts acknowledge that the 
competition will be much stiffer and will pressure other amusement parks to 
upgrade their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Studios Hollywood, owned by MCA Inc., is moving forward with a 
much-ballyhooed -- and much-delayed -- three-year, $142-million expansion. The 
agenda includes the planned addition next year of a $35-million E.T. ride, 
followed in 1992 by a Back to the Future attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The two major rides will be the first ever at Universal Studios Hollywood that 
are not part of the two-hour studio tour -- a major shift in direction for 
Universal, industry experts said. Theme park industry sources view Universal's 
willingness to plunk down a very sizable $35 million for E.T. as the start of 
the attraction's grab for more local patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Of the 5.1 million patrons who visited Universal Studios Hollywood 
last year, roughly 78% are from outside Southern California. That is far higher 
than Disneyland, for example, where about half of its 13 million customers in 
1989 came from outside the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
By adding new attractions, industry insiders said, Universal clearly is making 
a bid for customers who traditionally have been attracted to Disneyland and 
Knott's -- local residents who return more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Bullard, Universal spokeswoman, denied that the new attractions are a 
response to Disney or mark more than the evolutionary development of the studio 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
But industry experts noted that Universal Studios began trying to attract more 
local customers by introducing the Earthquake show in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake subject matter was no accident, believe me," said Winslow, the 
consultant. "Universal just had to look at its data to realize it's not getting 
its fair share of locals, and the Earthquake show brought in locals." 
</P>
<P>
Using glitzy new rides to draw local customers is not the only way that 
Universal will be fighting harder on its home turf. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that appears to be mirroring Disney's development in Florida, MCA 
Inc. plans to break ground in September on a quarter-mile shopping street at 
Universal City, which will link the 18-screen Cineplex Odeon with the studio 
tour entrance and two restaurants. The retail street is the first phase of a 
long-term development that MCA is planning for Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by introducing the E.T. and Back to the Future attractions -- as well 
as others in Florida -- Universal will have a complete cast of characters 
capable of matching Mickey, Kermit and Dumbo -- or Snoopy at Knott's -- said 
Dick Lyon, who heads the Lyon Group, a Pacific Palisades-based consultant to 
the leisure-time field. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, meanwhile, Universal is giving Disney an even tougher run for 
tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In May, MCA Inc. plans to open its $600-million, 440-acre Universal Studios 
Florida, 12 miles from Disney World. The MCA project is two-thirds the size of 
Disney's 135-acre studio tour and will include attractions themed on such 
blockbuster movies as "Jaws," "Ghostbusters," and "E.T." Patrons can shimmy 
through an 8.3-magnitude Earthquake ride or follow Dr. Brown in a DeLorean 
traveling Back to the Future. 
</P>
<P>
The new studio tour will even outdo the original Universal City version, with a 
full-bodied, 37-foot King Kong swinging from a bridge and attractions in which 
customers can take a screen test, flee the attack of "The Birds," or direct an 
episode of "Murder, She Wrote" -- then buy the videotape to bore their friends 
and relatives back home. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is responding by doubling the entertainment side of the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is also not ignoring Southern California, where 118 million tourists 
visited last year. Orange County alone had 35.1 million tourists in 1989, 
according to the Anaheim Visitor and Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
With those numbers, it's no wonder that Disney is eyeing a second gate. If the 
new theme park ends up in Long Beach, it "will certainly take advantage of the 
fact that we're on the water," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said Disney is considering a nautical attraction 
that "obviously will be ocean-oriented and educational -- not a Pleasure 
Island," referring to Disney's water park in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And that is sure to cut into the tourist traffic to Sea World of California in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not particularly concerned," said Bob Gault, president of the San Diego 
attraction. "We do marine life better than anyone else in the world. With Shamu 
and our killer whales, we're in a very strong position." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World in San Diego has one big advantage. After years of neglect from 
publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, it should get a boost of badly needed 
capital now that Anheuser-Busch Cos. bought the four Sea World theme parks in 
September. That infusion will begin this spring, when Sea World patrons should 
be able to feed bat rays and see eels and sharks in a $2.5-million Forbidden 
Reef pool. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, executives with Sea World, Knott's Berry Farm and Magic Mountain 
insist that they are distinct enough to complement Disneyland, rather than 
competing nose to nose. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our niche" of specializing in thrill rides and roller coasters, said 
Cochran, president of Six Flags, which has seven parks including Magic Mountain 
in Valencia. After all, 67% of Magic Mountain's customers are age 24 or 
younger. That's far different from, say, the throngs of families who flock to 
Disney attractions. 
</P>
<P>
In the theme park business, one sure way to bring back business is to give them 
a new thrill -- in other words, a new attraction that gives local patrons a 
reason to return to an amusement park. So major parks typically add at least 
one new attraction -- a ride, a parade or a show -- at least every other year. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm, for example, in April is unleashing Boomerang, a $5-million 
roller coaster. Magic Mountain, not to be outdone, is adding its own 
white-knuckler, the $8-million Viper, "the tallest, fastest, most astonishing 
steel roller coaster," which will race along at 70 m.p.h. and spiral upside 
down seven times. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, though, Magic Mountain executives are looking at more than 
steel rides to keep its turnstiles churning. If outside developers' plans gel 
to build hotels, golf courses, homes and offices near Magic Mountain, the 
amusement park hopes to start operating almost year-round within the next few 
years, said Joe Schillaci, president of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Magic Mountain could start marketing itself as a package along with 
Universal Studios so "people can spend several days" in a resort-like setting, 
Cochran suggested. 
</P>
<P>
After all the new rides, parades and hoopla, what else is there? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, competitors can try offering slightly lower admission prices. 
"There's not much else they can do," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. "They can spend a lot of money on marketing, but 
there's not much they can do to compete against Disney."

FOREIGN BUSINESSES SHOW INTEREST BUT MOVE CAUTIOUSLY IN EASTERN BLOC; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: PREDICTIONS OF AN IMPENDING INVESTMENT BOOM ARE EXAGGERATED, 
EXPERTS SAY. BUSINESSMEN ARE WARY OF PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL 
INSTABILITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The great foreign investment rush to Eastern Europe is off to a slow -- and 
decidedly cautious -- start. 
</P>
<P>
As country after country has broken away from Communist domination, headlines 
have trumpeted a flurry of new ventures in what used to be the Eastern Bloc. 
Japan's Daihatsu Motor has proposed a plan for producing compact cars in 
Poland. West Germany's Volkswagen is teaming up with an East German auto maker. 
And just this month, America's General Electric completed a deal for a majority 
stake in Tungsram, Hungary's state-owned lighting maker. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of foreign investors running around the country," exulted 
Kalman Meszaros, managing director of Hungary's international investment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
But appearances may be deceptive. Despite the headlines, analysts say, the 
overall volume of foreign-backed ventures is modest. 
</P>
<P>
That is bad news for the emerging East European democracies, which are counting 
on heavy investment from abroad to help provide the resources needed to 
modernize their economies and push them toward prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, which has revamped its foreign ownership laws and is several years 
ahead of its neighbors in overhauling its economic institutions, has received 
the lion's share of foreign investment to date. Poland is a distant second, and 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria remain virtually untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S. businessmen who have surveyed the prospects in Eastern Europe 
say predictions of an impending investment boom are greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"People think there is a gold mine there, but there isn't," said Jenik Radon, a 
New York-based lawyer who has helped arrange East European ventures for U.S. 
and other Western businesses. "There are opportunities in Eastern Europe, but 
you have to have patience." 
</P>
<P>
As many firms have, Monsanto, the St. Louis-based chemicals manufacturer, has 
passed up investing in Eastern Europe in favor of exporting there from its 
Western European plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you are likely to see increased investments over the next five years, 
but they'll be prudent and selective," said Michael A. Petrilli, Monsanto's 
director of international development. "You're not going to see any company bet 
the ranch on investment in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
With Western aid likely to be limited and borrowing from commercial banks 
almost impossible, Hungary's Meszaros calls foreign investment "by far the best 
way" for cash-short East European economies to obtain badly needed financing, 
marketing skills and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot reform our old system within our own means," Lech Walesa, leader of 
Poland's Solidarity Union, said recently. "This is impossible without outside 
help." 
</P>
<P>
At least on paper, Eastern Europe is a tempting prospect. It has a virtually 
untapped market of 120 million consumers, nearly bursting with pent-up demand. 
It is laden with natural resources and heavy industry. Its work force is 
reasonably sophisticated. Wage levels are low. Its governments openly welcome 
foreign ventures. And most Western governments -- including that of the United 
States -- are willing to guarantee investment loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern European countries are moving rapidly to revamp their laws to 
encourage more foreign investment. Poland and Hungary allow private ownership 
of property and corporations, and they permit foreigners to own 100% of any 
businesses that they buy or start. Earlier this week, East Germany joined the 
move by announcing plans to liberalize its own foreign investment rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd tell (businessmen) to start looking into it right now," said U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen are taking Mosbacher's advice. Mark Palmer, U.S. ambassador to 
Hungary, is resigning to head a new consortium of U.S. and Canadian financiers 
that is planning a series of investments in the region. Their first venture was 
the purchase of one of the oldest banks in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
But companies that invest in Eastern Europe also face daunting challenges. 
After 40 years under communist domination, Eastern Europe suffers from an 
infrastructure that is primitive by Western standards. The banking system 
barely functions. Hard currency and foreign goods are difficult to find. 
Competent managers are almost non-existent. Worker productivity is substandard. 
Technology is outmoded. Ownership rights are muddled. Shortages abound. 
</P>
<P>
Even more stultifying, the political situation is still too uncertain for 
investors' comfort. Not only does the situation in the Soviet Union remain 
unsettled, but most non-communist East European countries still lack basic 
stability. Even Poland, which has taken the boldest steps toward creating an 
attractive investment environment, concedes that its reform efforts could 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, said William T. Archey, vice president for international business 
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, "contrary to everything that you read in the 
papers, business is taking this one a little more cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
The companies that are most likely to make it in Eastern Europe "are the ones 
that have the resources to be patient," Archey said. "There is going to be no 
such thing as an overnight payoff." 
</P>
<P>
Western managers who have started ventures in East Europe echo Archey's 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
Zbigniew Puzio, Warsaw-based representative for A. M. Dan, an Australian 
entrepreneur, recalls the difficulty that he had trying to launch a simple 
construction project to build homes for senior citizens. Because Poland had no 
private property, simply obtaining the necessary land took weeks of 
negotiations, Puzio said. Shortages were so severe that it took months to get 
needed materials. And workers were so sloppy that he had to rip up some 
apartments and rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
Donald J. Mucha, chairman of Unitronex Corp., a Chicago-area trading company, 
ran into similar problems when he considered starting a fast-food chain in 
Poland early last year. With almost all real estate owned by the state, 
obtaining sites for pizza and chicken stands seemed likely to take years. The 
state-owned printing monopoly would not provide the logo-embossed cups and 
plates that he wanted. Ensuring a reliable supply of chicken was all but 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mucha has launched half a dozen successful joint ventures in Poland, 
this time the obstacles seemed just too formidable, and he shelved the proposal 
entirely. "I decided it just wasn't the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are familiar with the East European economies are advising would-be 
investors to stick to Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and -- eventually -- East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They also urge investments in manufacturing operations that are labor-intensive 
and relatively simple. Archey recommends industries such as food processing, 
farm-implement manufacturing and "infrastructure" development -- such as the 
establishment of delivery and distribution facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Movit, an analyst at PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting firm, said 
some bargains are out there, particularly among the relatively few 
internationally known East Bloc firms that have reasonably good reputations -- 
Tungsram is one example -- "that could be turned around relatively quickly" 
with an infusion of Western management, capital and some technology. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a wide opportunity for selling Western-made 
telecommunications equipment -- the telephone systems in all East European 
countries are shockingly out of date -- PlanEcon recommends avoiding 
high-technology manufacturing because it is too sophisticated for the East 
Europeans to undertake competitively. 
</P>
<P>
Also wide open is the market for building luxury hotels that are capable of 
serving Western visitors -- a natural for emerging East Bloc economies because 
the hotels employ local workers, earn their own hard currency from the West and 
help attract still more foreign investment. U.S.-based Marriott Corp. recently 
opened such a hotel in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Ward, senior vice president in Marriott's Bethesda, Md., headquarters, 
said the Warsaw venture has been successful enough that the company is eyeing 
"potential projects in most of the capitals of Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union," as well. 
</P>
<P>
Western governments are doing what they can to promote foreign investment in 
the emerging East European democracies. Along with the guarantees that the 
United States is providing for investment loans, Mosbacher has led two 
government-sponsored missions to interest corporate executives in investing in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials concede that neither mission bore much fruit. "The interest 
level has picked up substantially, but no one is ready to move yet," one 
strategist said. 
</P>
<P>
European firms, while visibly more active in Eastern Europe, are still playing 
a limited role, according to analysts who are tracking their ventures there. 
West German firms have a special interest in branching into East Germany, and 
Austrians have begun channeling investment money back into Hungary, where they 
have longstanding ties. But even they "are being cautious," PlanEcon's Movit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All sides agree that not much is likely to happen until East European countries 
guarantee Western-style property and ownership rights, work rules and access to 
capital. They also must provide the infrastructure that today's businesses need 
to function. And the transition to democracy and a free-market economy must 
proceed far enough along to win investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates for that range from two to 10 years, depending on the country. "The 
differences among the various East European countries are dramatic," lawyer 
Radon said.

HIS NOVEL, 'HOLLYWOOD,' IS JUST OUT, BUT THE GREAT CURMUDGEON IS NOT 
CELEBRATING 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA GRIZZUTI HARRISON, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison's latest book is 
Italian Days (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
IT IS DECEMBER, AND THE AIR is a wash of silky light, astringently cool, but 
sunny enough to allow one to bathe in multiple sensations of warmth. Under 
white canvas umbrellas in outdoor cafes the beautiful ladies of Rome in their 
beautiful furs cross narrow ankles; old men read their papers and sigh over 
remembered pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
On this gorgeous day, the restorers' scaffolding that has obscured the pillars 
of the Pantheon for a year has been removed; the building that is both 
prototype (cave) and culmination (temple) of all the buildings on earth is 
revealed in its amazing beauty. Gorbachev is in Rome talking to the Pope. All 
the city -- Catholic, communist, everyone young and old -- is wreathed in 
smiles. Perfection of weather and of hopes. The Berlin Wall is down. Old 
shibboleths crumble. There is a spirited will to joy. It is easier than usual 
to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"So, are you rejoicing?" I ask Gore Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever for?" he asks. "Surely rejoicing is somewhat premature," he says. 
</P>
<P>
GORE VIDAL HAS LIVED DOWN THE STREET from the Pantheon, in the historical 
center of Rome, since the mid-1960s; he lives in a penthouse with a wraparound 
terrace in the Palazzo Origo -- one of the more resonant addresses in Rome. It 
belonged to the noble family-by-marriage of Iris Origo, whose life was 
distinguished by more than graceful prose ("Saint Bernardino of Siena" and "The 
Merchant of Prato"). She had what Vidal calls a "good war" -- protecting her 
contadini from the Fascists, hiding escaped prisoners of war and Allied 
soldiers, feeding and housing the poor. Vidal knew Iris Origo and her 
Anglo-Irish / American family, of course. He knows, as they say, Everyone. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that to be in the proximity of this kind of nobility -- not of 
rank but of heart -- would make one contagiously happy. And, as a gloss upon 
one's happiness, one would, if one lived in the Palazzo Origo, have merely to 
cross the street to Delfino's, where the Italian version of takeout is 
purveyed: tender Roman artichokes in satiny olive oil, chicken alla diavolo 
grilled to golden succulence. 
</P>
<P>
"Does Rome still thrill you?" I ask Gore Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
"I still look at it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the city from which I have just come, copies of his new novel, 
"Hollywood" (available next week in the United States), are heaped in the 
windows of all the bookshops. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no cause to say hosanna," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A CAT CAN'T BE IN HEAT only three weeks after she gave birth, can she?" Vidal 
asks. A slim, milky-white cat with pale green eyes insinuates herself among our 
limbs, uttering a mournful cry of dumb lust. The elegant, kittenish creature -- 
who pleases Vidal because, motherhood notwithstanding, she (a Lolita in heat) 
doesn't look the least like an adult animal -- gave birth to a poor thing with 
a deviated septum. The offspring died in an attempt to suckle, drowned in its 
own mucus. This week, Vidal, 64, is being operated on for a deviated septum 
(which makes his face slightly asymmetrical and his voice nasal); he is 
apparently not a superstitious man. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing room is cold, the coldness of marble, and dark, very dark, though 
the sun shines brightly on the terrace, and the great chandelier in the dining 
room is blazing. The only source of heat -- the sun seems not to reach this 
room -- are two bouquets of roses, yellow and orange, tightly curled. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby of the Palazzo Origo, which houses a Berlitz school and a school of 
the dance, is white and Brunelleschi-gray, with bits of antiquity casually 
built into the walls, Roman-style. Vidal's apartment is achieved by means of an 
open lift, on which hangs a sign proclaiming that to use the lift is Strictly 
Forbidden, a sign that everybody -- Rome being a place where that which is 
forbidden is permitted -- ignores. 
</P>
<P>
We stand at first on the terrace, with its fresh view of Borromini's St. Ivo 
alla Sapienzia, its white corkscrew steeple joyously boring into the sky; the 
dome (from which wild flowers grow) of the Baroque St. Andrea della Valle; the 
Roman Synagogue (which Vidal has never been in); and two hills, the Janiculum 
and the Aventine. It is a shock to go from the sunny terrace to the dark living 
room, like coming out of a movie theater into bright sunlight, only in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Tapestries, ancestral portraits, a fanciful -- kitschy and also rather lovely 
-- mirror from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, leather, bibelots. I am pleased 
to sit on a chair frequently occupied, until his death in 1985, by Italo 
Calvino, of whom Vidal has written with affection and esteem. On the table in 
front of me are sun-dried figs and walnuts on wooden skewers, made in Vidal's 
villa in Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, south of Rome. On the table next to me 
are a photograph of Paul Newman -- faded almost to sepia -- with a floppy dead 
fish in his hand and a bewildered expression on his young face; an unframed 
colored snapshot of Vidal, a still from the made-for-TNT movie "Gore Vidal's 
Billy the Kid," in which he played a bit part; and, partially obscured by the 
colored snapshot, a framed picture of a 1940s kind of woman's face -- arched 
and stenciled eyebrows, dark glossy lips, shoulders framed in some heavy shiny 
stuff. A dusky male servant pads quietly, making unobtrusive arrangements here 
and there. 
</P>
<P>
In this solemn Roman apartment, and from this particular chair, it seems 
natural to speak of writers and writing. "You loved Henry James, no?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
"So is there a contemporary writer you love? I know you loved Calvino." (In 
fact, Vidal launched the Italian novelist in America in 1973. He reviewed all 
of Calvino's books in the New York Review of Books, the principal outlet for 
Vidal's essays since 1964; it was an act of writerly love.) 
</P>
<P>
"That was about it," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was it? Just Calvino?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I mean I like certain books, but there are no writers that really excite 
me. . . . As you are Catholic, I suppose you believe you'll meet him some day." 
</P>
<P>
"Calvino? I allow for that possibility. And you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Christianity -- your idea of a suffering God who became man -- is just 
ludicrous. Before Christianity came along we were doing very well. We had 
philosophy for the most advanced, plain old superstition for the superstitious 
and mystery cults for those who were worried about the afterlife. Something for 
everyone. . . . Calvino is in my brain." 
</P>
<P>
"So he's alive." 
</P>
<P>
"Till the brain goes." 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody else? Updike?" 
</P>
<P>
"A very charming and very skillful writer," Vidal says. "But not very 
intelligent. They wanted a right-winger and they got one. He should have been a 
preacher. 'Reverend Updike' sounds exactly right to me." 
</P>
<P>
"James Baldwin?" 
</P>
<P>
"I respected him. He was so hostile to Mailer and to me and to other young 
writers of the time, it was very hard to be around him. He only wrote one 
really good book -- the one with 'Beale Street' in the title, a kind of perfect 
novel, a small novel. You can make a small one come out properly, and he does. 
It's the least piss-elegant." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I am being unfair to him, I think; I broaden the question: "Who are the 
writers you admire?" 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite writers, when I was at the top of my energy and reading a lot, 
were Apuleius and Petronius, and my roots are in them -- much more than in 
Hawthorne or Melville, whom I don't care for. When your spiritual home is 
classical, romantic woolly American writing is just very distasteful. 'Moby 
Dick' is my idea of an irrelevant work. George Eliot is good -- you have to be 
40 and know the world to know how good she is. I like the novels of Carson 
McCullers; I like the short stories of Paul Bowles; I loved Waugh when I was a 
kid, I don't think I could reread him; I enjoy Graham Greene, but he tends to 
be 'the mixture as before.' I like some young fellow -- Ellis? something like 
that, I can't think." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal is elliptical in his praise, as one might be who shrinks from vulgar 
effusion or who places himself under constraint not to use the word love, 
believing that if he does, he will be held sternly to account for it. He has 
been generous in print; in stylish and moving essays he salutes writers as 
diverse as Saul Bellows and Tennessee Williams. When he speaks, in his chilly 
drawl, he is inclined to become jejune. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the sense he conveys that nothing -- including generosity -- counts 
for very much, stories about his own financial and emotional generosity abound. 
Writers speak of his willingness to bear their burdens when they endured 
terrible personal crises; at least one artist owes her villa in Umbria to his 
having come through with a personal loan at a crucial moment; a child in 
Ravello owes her eyesight to his efforts. (He also has apparently abandoned 
friendships for reasons tantamount, one ex-friend says, "to your saying you 
think he's perfect except for one dreadful shirt.") 
</P>
<P>
The Vidal-on-display is the Vidal who, in a series of noisy TV commentaries in 
1968, traded venomous insults with William F. Buckley (he called Buckley a 
"crypto-Nazi"; Buckley called him a "queer" and threatened to punch him); the 
Vidal who sued Truman Capote for libel after Capote said in an interview that 
Bobby Kennedy kicked a drunken Vidal out of the White House for placing a hand 
on Jacqueline Kennedy's bare shoulder. (Jacqueline Onassis and Vidal are by way 
of being related. Their mothers were married to Hugh D. Auchincloss. For a 
while, according to Vidal, Jackie claimed him as a brother.) 
</P>
<P>
The Vidal-first-met is Vidal-the-cynic (he calls himself a realist -- "an 
unbearable thing to be") who performs his iconoclastic but not wildly original 
liberal-left act on the "Tonight Show" (Johnny Carson and his then-wife, 
Joanna, visited Vidal at Ravello when their marriage, soon to fail, was in 
trouble -- this is one act of kindness Vidal can't not mention, perhaps because 
names of the famous are delicious in his mouth); the Vidal who exchanged deadly 
quips with Norman Mailer on Dick Cavett's TV show and publicly feuded with him 
(They have since made it up: "We ought not to be acting out private dramas in 
public to give our detractors purchase," he says). 
</P>
<P>
The Vidal-first-met is a weary and attenuated version of the public performer. 
He is tired. He is dully mischievous. He is sad. 
</P>
<P>
SURELY THE WORD LUCKY must often have been applied to Gore Vidal. But not by 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Vidal believes that we are all brought up in "cages" and are doomed to know the 
world only from the particular set of bars we find ourselves behind. His cage 
was golden, the cage reserved for those born to privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you get out of your cage?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," he says. "That's what everyone would like to know." 
</P>
<P>
And that is what he is disinclined to speculate about, at least out loud. ("Are 
wicked mothers invariably beautiful?" I ask, pursuing demons of my own. "Mine 
was," he says. "Do you want to talk about your mother?" "No.") 
</P>
<P>
In his bathroom hangs a picture of Vidal as a young Army warrant officer; he 
was then invariably described as "devastatingly handsome." There are also 
framed covers of Time and Newsweek -- one of Raquel Welch, his Myra 
Breckenridge ("Myra Breckenridge" is the work most frequently attacked when 
Vidal's moral probity comes under discussion; in his words, it is a novel 
"about a homosexual who becomes a woman, falls in love with a girl and then 
becomes, more or less, a man again."), another of Vidal himself, upon the 
publication of his novel "1876." Outside the bathroom hangs a framed list of 64 
signatures, those of residents of a small town in Maine who sent him greetings 
on the occasion of his 64th birthday. ("Will Philip Roth receive that on his 
64th birthday?" he asks.) 
</P>
<P>
Parts of his childhood sound made-to-order by Hollywood and the other capital 
of make-believe, Washington. His grandfather, Thomas Gore, was a blind Bible 
Belt senator whom a bare-footed 7-year-old Vidal regularly escorted to his 
Senate seat. His father, Eugene Vidal, was an aviation pioneer and a member of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's Cabinet. Vidal was the first child to cross the 
continent by plane; he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1943. He was 17. He would never go 
to college; he enlisted in the Army. When he was 19, stationed in the Aleutian 
Islands, he wrote his first novel, "Williwaw," a critical success. In his third 
novel, "The City and the Pillar," he wrote matter-of-factly about a homosexual 
relationship. The book was not advertised in the New York Times (the Kinsey 
Report wasn't either), and he complains of being "blackballed" by the literary 
Establishment. He offers in proof that his next five novels were not reviewed 
in the daily New York Times or in Time or Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
He wears these scars like stigmata. In 1976, he was elected to the National 
Institute of Arts and Letters -- "the American Academy and 200 immortals and so 
on; they sent me a very pompous telegram congratulating me, and I sent them a 
little short telegram congratulating them on having elected me. And then I 
said: 'I cannot accept this election as I already belong to the Diner's Club.' 
I made so many enemies with that one. John Cheever told me it was the rudest 
telegram he'd ever seen and so forth and so on. John said, 'Well, couldn't you 
at least have said Carte Blanche instead of Diner's Club?' " 
</P>
<P>
If generosity consists of being able to take as well as to give, it is fair to 
say that Vidal is lacking in generosity. He has been financially and critically 
rewarded. "Burr," "Lincoln," "1876," "Empire" and "Washington, D.C." -- his 
"novels in history" -- have been best sellers. Altogether, his 12 books have 
been translated into 20 languages and have sold an estimated 30 million copies. 
His plays have been produced on- and off-Broadway. He has written box-office 
successes for Hollywood. Jim Belushi just made a movie of one of his 
screenplays; Vidal is talking with Martin Scorsese about another; Hollywood may 
make "Hollywood" into a miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a golden boy with perpetual promise perpetually renewed. He has 
not, on the evidence, fared badly -- unless he wishes to be regarded as 
prescient, as a political and sexual guru, undisputed king of the literary and 
political mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Can anyone want so much? He once wrote that "very early, the idea of fame -- 
eternal fame -- afflicted our race." Surely his wounds have had time to heal? 
They suppurate. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984, I won the Pulitzer Prize for 'Lincoln.' " (In fact, he did not.) 
"There were three judges, as always, and two voted for me. The third -- a lady, 
some sort of novelist, I think -- said she would go public if this prize were 
given to such a bad writer. How many Americans can tell good writing from bad? 
I'm sure that little lady couldn't. They gave it to a very minor novel by a 
very good writer, Alison Lurie. And that was my Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the little lady didn't mean I was a bad writer, she meant I was a 
bad person; they always say bad writer when they mean bad person. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's no more than I expected," he says, consulting a glass of Scotch. "I 
don't want prizes, I don't want jobs in universities, I don't want to give 
readings. They can't understand that I'm not like them. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I sad?" The air, so cold, is thick with sadness. "My blood pressure must be 
a sign that something is irritated by them; it's much more likely it's reading 
the New York Times and not my own misadventures that sends my blood pressure 
up." 
</P>
<P>
He has been sitting sprawled on the sofa, his arms flung out, his pudgy fingers 
splayed, his smallish feet neat in shiny black moccasins. The green pullover he 
wears over a shirt untidily open at the waist to reveal a furry stomach wars 
with the warring colors of his face -- flushed red over gray, the complexion of 
a man with high blood pressure. He rises slowly and shuffles, this once 
devastatingly handsome man, to the door. 
</P>
<P>
GORE VIDAL FEELS "marginalized, demonized, trivialized." He says, "They find 
ways to discredit me so I won't be taken seriously." "They" are the literary 
Establishment, the government and "all of journalism -- the media is in place 
to make it impossible for anyone to take seriously anyone who is serious." 
</P>
<P>
"The Washington Times demonizes me. They have a cartoon of me that looks like 
the devil, and the Washington Post trivializes me in the Style section. It's 
all very giggly, just terribly giggly stuff." As for the New York Times, "I'm 
high on their enemies list and they're high on mine." 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give print interviews and win. You are the invention of the writer." 
And the media plague him with what he calls "the reverse." He cites an 
appearance on the "Today Show." Tom Brokaw, then the host, kept bringing the 
subject around to bisexuality, Vidal says. "I said, 'Look, Tom, bisexuality is 
a late-night subject.' When Brokaw started for the third time, I said, 'Now I'm 
going to talk about politics, we won't talk about me, we won't talk about your 
favorite subject, bisexuality -- we'll talk about Jimmy Carter.' 
</P>
<P>
"A year later, in Time, Brokaw said, 'There are some really tough moments in 
the business; for instance, I remember when I was doing the 'Today Show,' I had 
Gore Vidal on, and I wanted to talk politics and he wanted to talk 
bisexuality.' 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into Tom at a party and asked him why he'd lied. He pretended he 
couldn't remember. They do it to me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"I must always be discredited because nothing I say is true -- because I'm evil 
and an expatriate, and I hate America. They just go on, they drip torture. 'How 
can he write about America when he doesn't live here?' I didn't leave America. 
I've always had a house in America -- in Los Angeles -- and one in Europe. Many 
people have two houses." 
</P>
<P>
He has three. "I hate possessions but I have to have houses because I have to 
have books. I buy houses to put the books in. I once had a house on the Hudson, 
a Greek temple built in 1820. I finally sold it and got rid of everything. I 
found that I owned 42 sofas. Just think of that. I do not have sofas now." 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Vidal ran for Congress in upstate New York, and although he lost, got 
almost twice as many votes in a staunchly Republican district as the head of 
the Democratic ticket, his friend John F. Kennedy. From 1970 to 1972 he was 
co-chairman, with Dr. Benjamin Spock ("a funny guy -- looks like a mortician 
and knows nothing about politics") of the People's Party. In 1982, he ran for 
the Democratic nomination for the Senate in the California primary. He came in 
second in a field of nine, with nearly 500,000 votes; he spent less than any of 
the top four candidates -- about $50,000. Jerry Brown ("poor, innocent mouse") 
spent, he says, a couple of million. 
</P>
<P>
He said then that the American government is a government "of the rich, for the 
rich and by the rich -- socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the 
poor." 
</P>
<P>
"Forget the politicians," he tells me, "they're the cosmetic government. The 
real government are the very rich, something like a dozen families who always 
pretend they don't have anything to do with it but of course they do. It's like 
going to Rockefeller's house and saying, 'Well, he isn't in charge, he didn't 
cook the lunch.' They hire the cooks, they hire the presidents, and they hire 
the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
He believes that drugs should be legalized. He believes that the government, or 
"a rogue element in the CIA, the DEA or whatever, introduced drugs to gain 
total control over the lives of everybody in America so that they can make 
money. Mandatory blood tests, urinalysis, lie-detector tests. . . . They have 
set up the infrastructure of a police state, and they're not going to give that 
up. They know that sooner or later somebody's going to try to overthrow this 
government." 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese hate us, and, which is worse, are contemptuous of us. They come 
in every quarter and buy bonds that keep the government going. All they'd have 
to do is not come in one quarter. There's no way of keeping up this famous 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
"America has not created a civilization. We've started every now and then: But 
the waves of immigration meant we had to start all over again -- to absorb 
people who brought certain things of value but slowed down other things. Now 
we're taking in such huge waves, particularly from south of the border, who 
apparently do not take our culture seriously at all." 
</P>
<P>
These may or may not be incendiary beliefs. They're not novel. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for me to understand his despair; it is perhaps a matter of 
temperament. He inhabits, in fact, no gulag. He is denied no worldly success. 
Do enemies of the state appear on the Johnny Carson show? 
</P>
<P>
"If I spoke from a loser's stance," he says, "nobody would pay any attention to 
me. I do this so well. Interminably. But I'm paying a toll. I don't mind, I 
don't really mind at all. On the other hand, my blood pressure is very high, 
and I have to take a beta blocker for hypertension." 
</P>
<P>
A strange side-effect of the medication Vidal takes for his blood pressure is 
that he is no longer able to cry. His eyes will not produce tears. 
</P>
<P>
WE DRINK SCOTCH, we talk about phobias. He has a friend who is so afraid of 
Fifth Avenue that he cannot even be driven down it in a limousine. The next 
day, Vidal's greeting to me, as I come out of the creaky lift -- which he never 
takes -- will be: "Did the streets get you?" Two of the characters in 
"Hollywood" are so afraid of the dark that they cannot sleep alone; men, they 
sleep with other men for comfort, not for sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood: A Novel of America in the 1920s" is, of course, very much on Gore 
Vidal's mind, though he sighs with mingled exasperation and wit: "What is the 
joy of writing a novel? Finishing it." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal calls "Hollywood" a "contemporary novel." It takes the reader through the 
administrations of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding. It 
parallels matters of state with the silent-movie world of the '20s, moving 
between Washington and Los Angeles to make a perfect circle of corruption: 
"Films fed the people involved; people involved fed the films. L. B. Mayer 
reinvented America and the world. The world of Andy Hardy became echt-America, 
and not only did America fall for it, the world fell for it. And eventually 
they give us Ronald Reagan because he's a reminder of the great glory days, 
standing tall -- city on a hill -- a visible reminder of something that was 
imaginary to begin with. But it's soothing; and these are troubling times, so 
it was inspired to have him there -- it was a disaster for the country, but it 
was an inspired kind of artwork." 
</P>
<P>
After his more personal books did not receive universal accolades, he might 
have thought (though his intelligence surely would have advised him otherwise) 
that there was refuge and safety to be found in writing historical novels, that 
putting history on parade would make him less vulnerable than putting what were 
perceived to be his own feelings on parade. Such hopes, if hopes they were, 
proved illusory. And criticism from historians was more than he'd anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not it is legitimate to mix real characters with invented ones as 
Vidal did became a question much vexed. 
</P>
<P>
"I make it very clear, but people don't quite know how to handle it: People who 
were figures in history I don't play around with; they do and say what they did 
and said, as much as we can tell. After all, what is history? If you think 
history is reading all the New York Times' statements about a President, you're 
not going to get anywhere near it. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have done is to take the narrative back to its origins, right back to 
Homer. To Dante. To Shakespeare. To Tolstoy. I'm writing about the rulers, the 
victimizers, the kings, the gods, the heroes. I am the chronicler of the 
American republic -- which ought to be described in terms other than the 
god-awful history books that kids are supposed to read and wisely don't." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal has been attacked by academicians -- "scholar-squirrels" or 
"hagiographers" to him -- for fictionalizing actual political figures. They 
have fallen prey, he has said, to the naive delusion that there is "a final 
Truth revealed only to the tenured few in their footnote mazes." 
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of the flaws Vidal attributes to Lincoln: "Look what I've 
gone through just with Lincoln's syphilis! Lincoln told his law partner that he 
had syphilis: In fact he gave the name of the town and the name of the girl, 
and the name of the doctor he went to in Cincinnati. There was no cure. It was 
epidemic. And he had it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I've made a whopper -- and I've made a few -- it's always been from 
following 'authority.' I've always gotten it from the biography -- and the 
biography's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's coming to an end. I can't get the energy anymore for it." 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood" will be followed, he says, by the seventh and final installment of 
the historical cycle -- a book "from my point of view, in the present, looking 
back on 45 to 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
He will never not write. "You can say about me that I don't possess my own mind 
till I've written about it. I never know what I think until I write, and 
sometimes I don't know then." 
</P>
<P>
CAROLINE SANFORD, THE HEROINE of "Hollywood" insofar as "Hollywood" has a 
heroine, says that the word "faithfulness" in marriage has absolutely no 
application and makes no sense unless one has religious faith. Vidal concurs: 
"Faith is a Christian word, fideles. It's not a word that would ever grab her." 
Nor does it grab Vidal, who believes that "there is no such thing as a 
heterosexual person or a homosexual person, there are only heterosexual or 
homosexual acts. There is also no such thing as a heterosexual or a homosexual 
sensibility. What on earth does Eleanor Roosevelt have in common with Roy Cohn? 
One was a saint and the other a beast. 
</P>
<P>
"What is wrong with other-sex even if you're married? What is wrong with 
same-sex even if you're married? One would rather not be the occasion of 
someone else's pain but we all are sometimes and that's part of being alive; it 
goes with the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Genetically there's monogamy built into women -- they need nine months for 
that egg and a long time to make a commitment. For a man, the sexual act is 
quite enough, it doesn't have to lead to a relationship; sometimes it's far 
more kinetically exciting knowing that it does not. Boys hate kissing, girls 
start that stuff, you love that stuff. 'Just hold me,' that's all a woman 
wants. Boys aren't like that." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal has been with his companion, Howard Austen, for 40 years, a fact he will 
not meet head-on in conversation. "Well, there you are," he says. "Fidelity is 
such a large word. Human relationships change all the time. There you are. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians have sex right. They just do it." 
</P>
<P>
Howard's voice sounds from his bedroom. Howard's bedroom is covered in antique 
floral Roman wallpaper, muted reds and purples and hints of old gold -- 
Pompeian colors. Striped drapes and a striped bed canopy; chinoiserie. Curled 
on the bed, drinking excellent coffee from eggshell china (a gold spoon), I 
watch a documentary of Vidal's campaign in California. He looks young and fit. 
</P>
<P>
It has grown darker and colder. In the drawing room, Gore Vidal pulls the 
velvet drapes, lights the lights. 
</P>
<P>
He likes to dish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Thatcher: "She became all boy to become all prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan: "Poor Nancy, just in over her head." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush: "One knows that the beloved Barbara doesn't like anybody . . . 
except 'our kind.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Duke and Duchess of Windsor: "I liked her, she was very funny. Awfully 
shrewd. He was, I think, the stupidest man I have ever met -- and there was not 
much charm with it. We were once talking about coronations and I said that at 
the high point of the coronation of the Roman emperor, two masons with trowel 
and mortar appeared and said: 'We are here for your tomb, lord of the world.' 
And the Duke said, 'Oh yes; I'm a Mason too, you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Chaplin: "Paulette Goddard told me he was uncircumcised. She couldn't 
think of the word. She said, 'You know, he has one of those things.' I'd asked 
her if he was Jewish or not because there'd been something about it in the 
paper. 'Oh,' she said, 'with Charlie who ever knows? He lies all the time. But 
you know,' she said, 'he has one of those things.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Onassis: "She's very -- quite -- intelligent. She got everything she 
wanted. Specifically, money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you a story: We were up in Hyannisport -- this is the first summer 
of their presidency. After dinner I was playing backgammon with Himself. It was 
just Jackie and me and the President. And he was laughing away at some 
interview I'd given to Look magazine about what it was like growing up in 
Merrywood (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Vidal had, at separate times, lived 
at Merrywood, the Auchincloss estate in Virginia) when my mother was the 
reigning Mrs. Auchincloss. I said, 'Well, it was a very unreal world. You 
didn't know there was a Depression on when you were there -- there were five 
white servants in the houses, a great, great social distinction in Washington, 
where domestic help was usually black. Well, I became a private in the infantry 
when I was 17, so I was not much affected by all that. Girls are different; if 
you're brought up in an unreal world, you stay in one.' 
</P>
<P>
"The President said, 'What's all this golden-season crap you've been peddling 
about Merrywood? It was "The Little Foxes." ' He said, 'How do you explain how 
all of you are such disasters?' There's seven or eight of us (children and 
stepchildren, from Auchincloss' several marriages). 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the President went down through the whole lot of us, saying why this one 
was a failure and that one was a failure. He skipped Jackie and me. And Jackie 
and I looked at each other and then we looked at Jack, and she said, 'Go on.' 
</P>
<P>
"Jack got a little embarrassed. Jackie didn't say anything. I said, 'Well, 
naturally we can't be like your family -- intimating that such perfection was 
not given to mere mortals -- but if you do feel that we are individually flawed 
by being the children or stepchildren of Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Jr., I would 
put it down to one reason: Each of us had a mother he knew married only for 
money.' 
</P>
<P>
"Jack was quite shocked. He said, 'Oh, well you -- you -- you mean security.' I 
said, 'No, I mean money, big money.' And Jackie said: 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Barney Frank: "I was startled to see that Newsweek put Barney Frank on the 
cover -- an act of absolute viciousness, anti-fag and anti-liberal, what's a 
more beautiful combination to sell newspapers? 
</P>
<P>
"All we hear is private lives. Isn't he a nice man? Is that her hair? He 
certainly made a mess. But what does that have to do with legislation?" 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Roosevelt: "I saw a lot of Eleanor in the last 10 years of her life. 
She was so down on sex. One couldn't imagine her in bed. But when I read her 
published letters, I was convinced that her love (for a woman journalist) was 
100% physical. She told me that after Roosevelt died, she found evidence that 
he had broken his contract with her and continued to have an affair with Lucy 
Mercer. FDR might have thought it was fun to take Lucy away from Eleanor -- she 
was her girlfriend first. Eleanor went to her husband's funeral like Medea." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter: "He was Rockefeller's creature. And Coca-Cola's before that. What 
you want in a President is not someone nice but someone who has an interest in 
the people at large -- not the people who gave him the money to get there. You 
think he was a good man? What's that to do with it?" 
</P>
<P>
THE NEWSSTANDS in Rome can't keep their customers supplied: Everyone wants to 
read about the events in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two things going on in the world," Vidal says. "One is a centrifugal 
force to save the planet -- a bringing together of all the economies to 
preserve the air, water and soil. Then there's another force at work, which is 
that everybody is sick of the nation-state. So there will be some sort of 
confederation which will allow freedom to the people within: Scotland will no 
longer have to think about Westminster, Wales will be off on its own, so will 
the Basque country. All the ethnic disturbances going on within the Soviet 
Union will be resolved. If these things balance out, it will be ideal for the 
human race: You would have a world state which could preserve the planet and 
stabilize the economy, and simultaneously you would give individual groups, 
tribes and factions a chance to be themselves within that world state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far more likely that the bad guys will take over the world government, 
they'll forget to save the planet and we'll all be slaves." 
</P>
<P>
It's a bleak view. So what, I ask, does he do to refresh and renew himself? "We 
-- Howard and I -- go to Southeast Asia for at least one month in the winter. 
Thailand, the old Thailand, the country. I have many Buddhist friends, and I've 
started to learn meditation for my blood pressure. To remain tranquil and 
serene, which can only be done by not wanting anything. And that's the trick. 
Not wanting anything, you are on your way to enlightenment, on your way out of 
a world that is painful because of desire. I'm doing kindergarten exercises -- 
you empty your head, all you think about is breathing, in and out, in and out. 
Quite hard work, but it brings my pressure down. I know what true solace is but 
I don't turn to it. I'm too much a Westerner and I'm too shaped in the jungles 
of Washington to be anything but a carnivore. 
</P>
<P>
"What is true solace? Not to be what I am. Stop thinking of yourself, stop 
thinking of what you desire." "Are you afraid of death?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians decide when you're going to be dead some time before you are put 
in the ground. You can see it in Ravello. You can see old people becoming 
non-people. I'm sure everybody's nice to grandfather at home; but in the square 
there comes a moment when no one listens to him. Nothing harsh about it. 
They're baby-mad, child-mad, and they're mad about themselves in middle age. 
But there comes a moment, a shadow line, when a person ceases to be a person to 
the town. Haven't you seen it in Ravello? In the square? The very old sitting 
in a line? And then one day the line thins out." 
</P>
<P>
I have seen them, the old, the very old, the young, the middle-aged; and I have 
thought: One of the things I love about Italy is that the old are not despised. 
And each Italian knows -- it is knowledge bred in the bone -- that he must die. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty more where we came from," Vidal says. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age," he says, "nobody is afraid of death. I think what you're afraid of 
is the passage to it. I think I might take a shortcut." 
</P>
<P>
I protest. Suicide sets a bad example, I say; and it is contagious. "There are 
plenty more where we came from," he says. 
</P>
<P>
JUST DOWN THE street, his servant is buying tangerines. The shop is brightly 
lighted. The warm air is threaded with cold. In the piazza of the Pantheon, 
everyone looks at home in his skin. The thin music of a flute comes from a 
wandering musician. Lovers hold hands.

<P>
The system often breeds an attitude that focuses on competition, not 
comprehension. It also breeds insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phil Donahue from "Donahue: My Own Story," 1979 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sensitive gets testy when people quiz him about dwarf-tossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't toss the dwarfs," protested Phil Donahue, the 54-year-old prince of 
the afternoon TV talk show circuit. "Someone else did it and demonstrated that 
it's being done actually as a commercial activity. I don't apologize for a 
moment that I exposed this activity on my program. It's important." 
</P>
<P>
A close examination revealed no tongue in either of Donahue's cheeks. He 
focused his aqua eyes on his interrogator like lasers, then leaned forward with 
both elbows planted squarely on the edge of his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are we? What shall we tolerate?" Donahue shouted with magnificent outrage, 
slapping his open palm on top of the desk. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his 8th-floor office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, he thrust his chin out 
like an Irish boxer who dares any man in the room to take a poke at him. "And 
what . . ., " he said, laying in a dramatic pause in his list of reasons for 
doing the show, "does the dwarf have to say?" 
</P>
<P>
What Donahue said about "the little people" on an October taping of his 
hour-long daily exercise in sociopolitical discourse was obviously dead serious 
stuff to him. The program was entitled "What We'll Do for Entertainment," and 
it revolved around the recently imported Australian tavern practice of 
shot-putting dwarfs for sport, usually after both thrower and/or throwee have 
imbibed a tankard or two of ale. People will apparently do, or watch, most 
anything for entertainment . . . a prospect that puts Phil Donahue smack dab in 
the middle of an integrity tug of war of national proportions these days. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, his credibility as a newsman-turned-talk-show-host has been 
painstakingly erected over two decades, based on his willingness to tackle 
serious national issues, ranging from war to starvation to abortion to AIDS. On 
the other, Donahue knows he must flashdance with the best of them or risk 
losing his ratings and, ultimately, his show. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time not so many years ago when Donahue used to build a whole hour 
around give-and-take discussions with a single congressman about a single issue 
of national importance. Now, he says with a resigned candor, the only 
congressional representative he could build a show around would be Barney 
Frank, the gay Democrat from Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue is schizophrenic on the subject of trash TV. He regrets the recent turn 
to tabloidism, but remains optimistic enough about its possibilities to get 
down into the transvestite trenches with the likes of both Geraldo and Oprah. 
He has taken plenty of shots for his decision. Last year, a panel of TV critics 
zeroed in on him in a general skewering of the sorry state of television talk 
shows. The panel, whose criticisms were subsequently aired as a special on PBS, 
was particularly hard on Donahue because he was once viewed as the sage of the 
talk show circuit: a beacon of intelligence in the often tawdry world of 
afternoon soap opera and game shows. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue admits to some low-road programming in recent years, chiefly to "draw a 
crowd" and stay on the air. But he puts some of the blame on the audience. If 
America hadn't slipped into an MTV coma, intent on entertaining rather than 
informing itself, "Donahue" might continue to host members of Congress instead 
of members of the circus, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 23 years, everyone from Jimmy Hoffa to George Bush to Pete Rose 
has been on "Donahue," spilling their guts to the fast-talking host, to his 
mostly female in-studio audience and, ultimately, to the nation. Some 200 TV 
stations continue to carry the oldest of the current daily syndicated talk 
shows, and Donahue has a contract with Multimedia Productions to keep up the 
pace at least through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But something has changed in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
The man who started his talk-show odyssey back in Dayton, Ohio in 1967 is loath 
to admit it, but the competitive onslaught of tabloid TV has taken its toll on 
both his program's content and how it promotes itself, and on Donahue 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
Until four years ago, Donahue had the afternoon crowd all to himself. He didn't 
even have to use his last name. Everybody knew who Phil was. He had married 
Marlo Thomas in 1980, had been a regular contributor to the "Today" show, had 
hosted prime-time specials, had written his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Oprah Winfrey in 1986, followed by Geraldo Rivera a year later. Sally 
Jessy Raphael jumped from radio to afternoon TV in 1988 and Joan Rivers entered 
the sweepstakes last fall. Donahue is still in the race, but he no longer leads 
the pack. In its annual ranking of the most-watched syndicated TV programs, 
A.C. Nielsen put "Donahue" in 10th place last summer with a 6 rating. "Geraldo" 
was in 9th place with a 6.1 rating and "The Oprah Winfrey Show" came in 5th 
with an 8.6 rating. (The top two syndicated shows remain "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"Jeopardy!") 
</P>
<P>
Donahue puts the best face on what he has been forced to do to keep up his 
ratings, but if he talks long enough about it, it becomes plain that he doesn't 
especially like it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't understand how we survive in TV, no argument I make is going to 
make a difference," he said. "We get paid to draw a crowd. When we don't draw a 
crowd, we don't get paid." 
</P>
<P>
With a shock of brunette hair in those early Ohio days, he looked more like a 
Charles Grodin than a Steve Martin. But time and fame have changed that. The 
haircut may still be boyish and the wide-eyed mannerisms still endearing, but 
the hair itself is nearly white. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at a very good part of my life," he said. "I'm very happy. I'm probably 
not the jack-in-the-box I once was, but I've got lots of energy. I'm very 
blessed." 
</P>
<P>
He knocked on the wood-grained Formica of his desktop and lay back in his 
chair, folding his hands behind his head in a show of just how relaxed he 
really is these days. 
</P>
<P>
That attitude seems to extend to the rash of talk shows that have risen up to 
challenge him in recent years. "Everybody with a hammer and nails is building a 
talk show set these days," said Donahue, who tries to take the high road in 
addressing the competition. Keeps him on his toes, he says. Makes him more 
keenly competitive, he says. Gives the audience a wider variety of programming 
from which to choose, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is something of a downside to the rash of new shows too, and it ties 
in with the tossing of dwarfs for fun and profit or borrowing a dress from one 
of his producers and showing up on camera looking like the late Divine. Though 
he maintains that he has always billed himself first and foremost as an 
entertainer, Donahue got his broadcasting start as a newsman . . . and therein 
lies the Donahue dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to stay up all night editing shows. Documentaries," he recalled 
wistfully during his laid-back pose in a recent interview. "I used to wait 
until 3 or 4 in the morning, until Jimmy Hoffa came out of his hotel room, so I 
could get an ambush interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize it then, but as I look back now, I worked two or three times 
harder than a lot of the people around me. I used to have cameramen when I was 
doing local news who, after three or four hours on a story, wanted to go home. 
I wanted them to wait another hour and they would have some suggestions as to 
what I could do with the camera." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip John Donahue, the only son of a staunchly Irish Catholic middle-class 
Cleveland couple, maintains that he is not a journalist -- at least, not in the 
traditional sense. His degree from the University of Notre Dame is in 
marketing, after all, not journalism and, like his successful 
furniture-salesman father, he has learned how to turn his pugnacious gift for 
blarney into dollars and cents through razzle-dazzle huckstering. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that he and his peers are not journalists in the traditional sense 
does not mean that they cannot contribute to "this pool of information, in the 
middle of which might be found the legacy or vestige of the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody needs to take a test to be a journalist," he said. "Nobody needs to 
have a college degree. Nobody needs to appear before a board. Nobody needs to 
give a urine analysis. Nobody has to do anything. Everybody can be a 
journalist, including moi." 
</P>
<P>
And yet his roots are in the traditional journalism that he characteristically 
condemns, particularly as practiced by the Washington press corps. He is quick 
to criticize the faint of heart who let Ronald Reagan get away with eight years 
of obsequious half-truths and he musters up his trademark bluster over the 
failure of the nation's newshounds to uncover Iran-Contragate, the HUD scandal 
or the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they pandered in their own way to what their readers wanted," he said, 
contemptuously adding in a sing-song tone of voice: "Ronald Reagan, he's our 
man, he can fight the Commies if anybody can." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue is an admitted C-SPAN junkie, rarely misses "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour" and regularly reads the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. 
At 54, he wants to pursue the truth as passionately and as tirelessly as he did 
at 24. But he also wants to stay on the air so that he can pursue the truth 
before several million viewers each afternoon. In order to do so, he has to 
walk a fine line between imitating Edward R. Murrow and P.T. Barnum. The 
balancing act is becoming more precarious with each passing sweeps rating 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the worst thing they say. You ready?" Donahue asked. 
</P>
<P>
He sat at a table in the drafty New York studios of NBC across from Tammy Faye 
Bakker, just days before her husband was to be sentenced to 50 years in federal 
prison for fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready, Phil," answered Tammy Faye. 
</P>
<P>
"You lost your soul," Phil said in a hushed voice. "You almost did." 
</P>
<P>
"Well. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, isn't that possible?" he persisted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's not possible," she answered, "but I never forgot -- and 
I'll say this before God -- I never forgot my background. I never forgot where 
I came from. . . . Every time I get in a bathtub full of bubbles I say 'thank 
you God' that I can take a bubble bath. And I mean that. I never forgot that it 
was God that put me there." 
</P>
<P>
A few days before, Donahue sat in the same studio with Zsa Zsa Gabor, leading 
her through a reliving of the trauma of being pulled over in her Rolls-Royce by 
a Beverly Hills cop. The audience learned that the cop bore a resemblance to 
Tom Selleck and that he secretly wanted to sleep with Zsa Zsa. Then, as Donahue 
put it, again in his dramatic hushed voice, he asked her what he called "the 
killer question": 
</P>
<P>
"I read this in Parade magazine. They say you're 70," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is full of bull," said Zsa Zsa as the camera pulled in tight for a 
close-up of her crow's feet. 
</P>
<P>
And the in-studio audience roared. 
</P>
<P>
Out in America they roared too, judging by the Nielsen overnights. The Zsa Zsa 
and Tammy Faye shows were among the most popular "Donahue" programs in months. 
</P>
<P>
But when he had former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon on last October, 
he attracted only 1% of the available viewers -- a fraction of his usual 
audience. Similarly, when relatives of the 27 victims of the USS Stark were on 
his show, thousands of dials all over America switched to another channel. 
</P>
<P>
"I better not have Ariel Sharon or a variation on the theme thereof too often 
or the only job available to me may be self-appointed high-priest hopscotching 
around the country scolding journalists for not telling people what they ought 
to know," he said. "I'm not that messianic." 
</P>
<P>
He wishes more people would watch when he has guests like Sharon on, but the 
very fact that he has at least some portion of the nation tuned in helps 
justify the big-draw programs on Zsa Zsa, adultery and dwarf-tossing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Donahue maintains that he has not lowered his standards just to bring in 
an audience. He has always had to balance between the profound and profane. He 
wore a dress on his program years ago, but didn't get the sort of press he did 
when he wore one again in November, 1988. He brags about being the first to 
bring male strippers to afternoon TV in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
But if any of the quasi-news programs that have cropped up in recent years have 
appeared to grow more lurid, shallow or titillating, the blame has to be shared 
by the viewers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's my point: We're being asked to give them the news," he said in defense 
of television in general. "We are asked to be a BBC media and part of our job 
is to attract an MTV audience. I don't want to be a dead hero. So, you know, I 
can't walk all over the face of a local news director who covers a bloody 
accident with more film than he covers a meeting between (Yitzhak) Shamir and 
(Shimon) Peres. I get it! I didn't last 23 years at this without slowly 
evolving into a recognition of what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
What's going on, as Donahue describes it, is a culture in decay. To illustrate 
his point, he falls back on a frequently told story about his first visit to 
the Soviet Union with 300 Muscovites a couple of years back. He asked them 
where they would like to visit if they could come to America and the first 
person he spoke to told him Las Vegas. A second respondent named Oxford, Miss., 
as her choice because that was the birthplace of William Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
"They read," Donahue said. "They're more familiar with Mark Twain. They seem to 
have had less information over the past 70 years to be sure, but they may have 
more knowledge. They're fascinated by this country. They're curious about 
homeless people and naked ladies on 42nd Street. But they're also fascinated by 
the wealth. They want to know about the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. They 
want to know about Southern California, the entertainment industry. 
Fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue delivers one of his patented pregnant pauses, then urgently whispers: 
</P>
<P>
"What's the comparable fascination with the Soviet Union on the part of the 
American citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
That having been said, however, business is business. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time not so many years ago when people like Pulitzer Prize-winning 
author David Halberstam called "Donahue" a televised "Ph.D. course" and 
humorist Art Buchwald showed up with regularity to discuss his latest book. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Halberstam says that "Donahue" has "lost its soul" and Buchwald 
claims he can't get an invitation to come on the show unless he gets a 
sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue's answer is that times change. He used to have authors on as regularly 
as Larry King does on his radio show. He asked Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) 
and Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) on as little as three or four years ago. He 
probably wouldn't have them on today. Times change and so do topics of 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, Peter Jennings did a piece on date rape," Donahue said. " 'NBC 
Nightly News' did a thing on excessively vulnerable wives. If we did this on 
daytime, it would be called trash TV." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Donahue participated in a televised panel discussion about tabloid 
TV talk shows and journalism. Entitled "Entertainment News or Entertainment?" 
the Columbia University-sponsored discussion, featuring Donahue and 10 other 
well-known talk show hosts and/or journalists, quickly became an indictment of 
"trash TV." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue in particular took his lumps. Unlike his Johnny-come-lately 
competitors, he once epitomized the essence of afternoon blue-ribbon 
programming with his razor-sharp, no-nonsense probing of Watergate figures, 
foreign dignitaries and Love Canal environmental malefactors during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the contrast, the panelists -- who ranged from Washington Post 
TV critic Tom Shales and syndicated radio host Larry King to Geraldo Rivera and 
Morton Downey Jr. -- were treated to a more recent film clip of Donahue in a 
red dress and hose during the ratings sweeps period in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue offered no apologies. He made his choice to stick with the syndicated 
program rather than strike out for a job in network news and defends it. There 
is more editorial freedom in the kind of syndicated show that he produces five 
days a week than there is in network news, even if he does have to pander a bit 
on occasion. Besides, he is paid better than any comparable network news star, 
which is one of the chief reasons he has sidestepped overtures to move to 
network TV. He also answers to no "network vice president who wakes up Tuesday 
morning and decides while he's shaving that he doesn't like you and doesn't 
want you around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue's attempts to boost ratings is no worse than a newspaper's attempts to 
boost circulation, he said. In fact, doing a daily talk show is comparable to 
writing a daily newspaper story, he added. The flaws, mistakes and poor 
judgment calls that sometimes characterize a story written under deadline 
pressure also happen in a daily talk show produced under deadline pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The brand of journalism that Donahue and his fellow talk show hosts practice 
adds a healthy diversity to the national information pool, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Tabloid TV panel discussion last spring, he has gone even further in 
defending himself and his fellow purveyors of this new kind of journalism. 
Programs such as "Hard Copy," "A Current Affair" and "Inside Edition" will join 
Donahue, Geraldo and Oprah in breaking new ground, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"There's information in these programs," he said. "A lot of these lofty 
critics, breathless with indignation, railing at the television world going to 
hell . . . their criticism lacks precision. They rail against the titillation 
and sensationalism, in my opinion, without reviewing all the content of these 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
If such programs fail in the ratings, they are likely to be replaced by more 
game shows, more soap operas and more reruns -- a prospect that will lead to 
less information being fed to the American public. Even if it is couched in 
tabloid terminology, it is information and some of it is helpful, educational, 
even revealing in more than simply the decolletage sense, according to Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs perform a service. They may be the last best hope when the cops 
arrest your sister. It's a cinch the networks aren't going to try to get your 
sister out of jail," Donahue said. "I'm not guaranteeing it, but I'm saying 
it's possible, and if we join the chorus of critics, we make the producers of 
these shows more timid. They start to catch Reaganitis like the so-called 
'straight' press. They start jumping on the bandwagon instead of covering it." 
</P>
<P>
No apologies -- not for cutting deals to get "hot" guests on the air before 
anyone else, nor for putting tossed dwarfs and roller games queens and 
transvestites on the air during the after-school viewing hours, nor for airing 
panel discussions on such topics as "catching your mate in bed with someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
"Come on," Donahue said in disgust. "Let's get rid of the pretense and 
understand that we've got an unholy alliance between the media, which is 
focused on ratings and circulation, and a community of people that it serves in 
the marketplace who are focused on Madonna, Jim and Tammy Faye and Zsa Zsa!" 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Donahue had a stinging panel discussion with the White House 
correspondents from all three major networks and CNN, blasting the Bush 
Administration's invasion of Panama. It was thought-provoking enough to warrant 
a call from Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, requesting a tape of 
the show for the President's personal viewing. It is a program of which Donahue 
is very proud. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, he did an hour on the sensational Stuart murder case in 
Boston, in which a husband allegedly murdered his pregnant wife for the 
insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
The Stuart show beat the White House correspondents in the ratings in virtually 
every market where "Donahue" airs. A quick glance at any magazine stand in the 
country will explain why, the host suggests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident in any perfunctory review of the covers of Time and Newsweek, 
which are increasingly looking more and more like People magazine! I don't 
condemn them for this. There's no sense in writing if nobody's reading. There's 
no sense in talking if nobody's listening." 
</P>
<P>
When his current contract is over 2 1/2 years from now, Donahue is seriously 
thinking about getting out of the talk show business and hosting, instead, 
thoughtful documentaries in the vein of "The Human Animal" series that he 
produced for NBC several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We carried our time period five straight nights," he said. "It was expensive 
and it took three years to put together. It was a lot of work, but it was a lot 
of reward too. I think I'd like that kind of challenge: something that is the 
opposite of daily deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
But he likes the Adrenalin and the adulation of having his name and face out 
there every day too. It won't be easy to abandon. He will be 56 years old and 
will have been talking to TV audiences for one quarter of a century when his 
contract expires. He might run for public office if winning looks realistic, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not certain my politics are electable right now," he said. "The '80s have 
not been my decade." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't like the idea of having to beat the bushes for campaign money, 
and questions whether he is dedicated enough to go to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I once sat in the gallery with some senators and asked them: How many nights a 
week are you working? And they told me a minimum of four nights. Well, I want 
to come home and read the paper at night," he said.

<P>
Dean Hargrove doesn't seem to sweat. His sleeves are buttoned and his tie is 
invariably knotted neatly in place. His desk is serenely clear of clutter, his 
office accented with red poinsettia and French lithographs. 
</P>
<P>
He is soft-spoken, reticent, the picture of equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
But Dean Hargrove's profession is murder and mystery. Four times a week. Rain 
or shine. 
</P>
<P>
He is executive producer of "Matlock" on NBC, "Jake and the Fatman" on CBS, 
"Father Dowling Mysteries" on ABC and "Max Monroe: Loose Cannon" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The A.C. Nielsen Co. counting staff figures that Hargrove's shows had a 
combined viewing audience last week of between 120 million and 130 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't include the 38 million who watched his fifth series last 
Sunday, the recurring "Perry Mason" adventures on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
What with people around like Aaron Spelling, Norman Lear, Stephen Cannell and 
others who are renowned for sheer television bulk, it's uncertain if Hargrove 
can claim a Guinness World Record as a creative writer-producer. But in 
observing him over several weeks in casting sessions, story conferences and 
assorted meetings trying to solve unsolvables, he seems to stretch human 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Life in television is life on the cutting edge of deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gags around his office -- like gallows humor -- is that if something 
is demanded four days or more from this moment, that's "an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
As of this week, Hargrove and his merry band had produced 51 episodes this 
season, had five more in production and had 17 scripts in various stages of 
writing, rewriting and pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
A status report on each series: 
</P>
<P>
"Perry Mason" is in its fifth season of three or four movies a year, with 
Raymond Burr in the not-unfamiliar role. A first cut of an episode shot in 
Paris before Christmas, to play in May, was just turned in. Another installment 
begins shooting Monday in Denver. And NBC just ordered six more movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock," starring Andy Griffith in his fourth season as a country-folks 
lawyer, is shooting its 18th and 19th episodes (a two-parter) for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Jake and the Fatman," with William Conrad and Joe Penny in their third season, 
is doing its 18th episode this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Dowling," which shoots in Denver, premiered Jan. 4 on ABC 
(matriculating from a short run on NBC), with Tom Bosley as the high-collared 
investigator and Tracy Nelson as Sister Steve. Episode 10 started Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Loose Cannon" opened on CBS Jan. 5, starring Shadoe Stevens as an L.A. cop who 
has perfected a style of reckless abandon. Episode 6 is being completed. But 
the series -- pummeled by the critics and disdained by viewers -- was pulled 
after Friday's episode and, Hargrove shrugged, "they (CBS) will bring us back 
in March in a different time period and we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove takes a simple approach to pressure: "It's turning out scripts," he 
said. "I mean, I think producing a TV series is essentially producing scripts. 
Every eight days somebody's got their hand out for another script." 
</P>
<P>
He works on a series "until it finds its speed or own internal rhythms." Then 
the day-by-day duties are handled by the staff. 
</P>
<P>
But: "Well, there's always going to be problems -- most of which you can never 
anticipate. You deal with them and move on. I've had to make a couple of trips 
to Hawaii (where "Jake and the Fatman" is filmed) where I fly over, get off the 
plane, have meetings and get on the plane and fly back. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I ever really feel the pressure is like starting these two new 
shows from a standing start. I have to put together a staff and I've got to put 
enough scripts together and I'm looking at those dates (deadlines)." 
</P>
<P>
His partners are Fred Silverman, who does the dealing for the team, and Viacom 
Inc., the entertainment conglomerate. It puts up the money. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman is a legend of the business with stints as programmer at all three 
major networks. His image has been Couch Potato Supreme -- one of the rare few 
TV executives who will "admit" that they watch TV and love it. 
</P>
<P>
He talked show details with Hargrove most every day until felled by a coronary 
in November. "Now I do a couple hours of work every other day," Silverman said 
from his Malibu beach house. "I hope very shortly to be back to a fairly normal 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that he and Hargrove are "an unlikely odd couple -- Dean is 
lower-key, kind of WASPish. I'm more volatile. He's from Kansas; I'm from New 
York. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One of their producers said that they're most anxious to get a sitcom on the 
air because of all their murder shows. "We call them," he said, "the Beasts of 
Brentwood." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing "dailies" (each day's shooting) or episodes in varying stages of 
editing can be an exercise in anguish, since it essentially is a matter of 
assembling bits and pieces of the story so that it results in a reasonable 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove sits behind his desk, visitors on the sofa. They all eyeball the TV 
set as the cassettes run. 
</P>
<P>
He told the producer and editors one day that the music was too thin in one 
"Loose Cannon" scene and too big in another. 
</P>
<P>
He froze the tape when NBC called. The network has this idea about opening 
"Matlock" next season with an episode in Japan, for the promotional value. NBC 
wanted his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the tape. Producer David Solomon spotted graffiti on an alley wall that 
Max drives by: "Is that the Crips (the L.A. gang)?" Hargrove laughed: " 'Fraid 
they're gonna sue?" 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove looked at cryptic notes: This sequence he didn't believe. One action 
needed to be "punctuated more"; "this scene just lays there for me." 
</P>
<P>
In one "Loose Cannon" episode, Max is trying to trap a hit man and gets himself 
up in blackface as a cook with some sort of twisted dialect. Might have been an 
attempt at Pakistani. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon reported that "Shadoe wants more of that scene. How he got a cut of the 
show, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "He got a cut of this show?" 
</P>
<P>
Director Chris Hibler: "That shouldn't ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon: "It should never happen. But he did and called about changes in that 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "We should find out how it he got it (the tape). I don't want to 
persecute him. Just make sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon: "I said, 'Where did you get it?' He said, 'I'm not talking.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove shares a suite on the Universal Studios campus with Joel Steiger and 
Joyce Burditt, his key "Matlock" producers. On one of the walls in his office 
there's a monster photograph and autograph of Boris Karloff and a quaint 
picture of half of Alfred Hitchcock looking around a corner outside Studio 18. 
Through the window to the lot, you can see the caricature of Hitchcock's round 
cheeks against the screening theater bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
With a shag of hair, with the smallest flecks of gray, Hargrove, 52, is 
laid-back, Midwestern proper. He looks trim. He noticed a paunch last August 
and now brings in an exercise pro three early-morning half-hours a week. 
Hargrove has lost 29 pounds, bought some new ensembles, and is holding. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't strike you as a funny guy but "I still see myself as a comedy writer 
basically" and "if there is a common trend in the shows, I would hope it would 
be a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
He started off straight enough -- born in Iola, Kan., went to Wichita State 
(political science), UCLA film school, then jokes on the original "Bob Newhart 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Other employments: "Man From U.N.C.L.E.," "Girl From U.N.C.L.E.," "It Takes a 
Thief," "Name of the Game" (Gene Barry's segments), "Columbo," "McCloud," 
"Madigan," "McCoy," "Holvak," "Me and Mom" and "Return to Mayberry." 
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to see the writer -- which is how Hargrove sees himself. He 
leaves few clues around. 
</P>
<P>
There's a typewriter covered in the corner, next to a computer, new and unused. 
"I never learned it," he said. (Secretary Ann Farina figures that he's afraid 
of the technology.) 
</P>
<P>
There are no shreds of old notes and misdirected scenes scattered around, sure 
signs that a writer has been there. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove is all calm and composure. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Griffith calls him "the quiet man." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, the former actress Brenda Scott, who runs Fables, an antique store in 
Studio City, asserted that "it's taken me forever just to get him to do the 
minimum talking." 
</P>
<P>
In a craft given to frustrations and tantrums, where's the temper? 
</P>
<P>
One of his "bosses," Henry Schlieff, chairman and CEO, Viacom Broadcasting and 
Entertainment Groups, New York, marvels that Hargrove is "almost unique in that 
(Hollywood) environment," referring gingerly to "the diversity of personalities 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
The NBC executive on "Matlock," Charisse McGhee, director of drama programs, 
said that the extent of Hargrove's temper in disagreements with her are 
something like "Are you ever going to leave me alone on this?" 
</P>
<P>
Billy Campbell, director of current series at ABC and the contact on "Dowling," 
only recalled a single time when Hargrove raised his voice: "When he and I 
played basketball at his club one Sunday morning, because I didn't pass him the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove knew Gerry Conway as a writer with Marvel Comics and worked with him 
on a long-ago project. Conway came in to talk with Hargrove and was assigned to 
rewrite a script. He was sent "Loose Cannon" scripts. Then he came in to see 
the boss. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'd like to do is run it through your typewriter," Hargrove said. "And 
we should make it a little more urban, a little more contemporary. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The script came from Brian Clemens, a writer-producer of some special regard 
since he co-created "The Avengers," a most celebrated English series. He now 
works as executive story consultant via phones and faxes from his home in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is tricky -- the episode is called "Tricks" -- about a silent movie 
star whose nephew is immersed in the arms racket. Plus other complications. 
(Director Dan Attias instructed an actress during the audition for another key 
role, "She's an undercover FBI agent who's chasing a terrorist -- but she's got 
amnesia. So you don't really need to know that anyway. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove said the basic structure of the scripts works well: "I don't think you 
have to do much in terms of plotting. At this point, we just wanted to get you 
to get a pass at it." 
</P>
<P>
Conway: "How about the humor?" 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "The humor in it should be a little more like the humor you read in 
the other scripts." 
</P>
<P>
Conway: "Seemed a little more distant." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "Exactly. Brian is British and, you know, there's a slight idiomatic 
difference. I mean, he's terrific and he has some very nice things. As I say, 
this is not to make work. If you find parts of it in terms of dialogue you 
like, don't feel that you're obliged to do anything to it. But I'd like to get 
basically your fingerprint on it." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Conway's eventual rewrite was adjudged on the button and 
Hargrove promptly gave Conway a "Dowling" assignment. 
</P>
<P>
What makes for good television? "I don't know how to answer," Hargrove said. 
"That's always a matter of opinion. There are successful programs and there are 
good programs and sometimes they're the same programs. How often, that's the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
His shows are obviously popular but, if not critically attacked, "they're 
usually critically ignored. I'd say 'Matlock' has never been acclaimed, but I 
don't think it's ever been badly reviewed. 'Loose Cannon' got some bad 
reviews." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal is traditional-form, old-fashioned mainstream mystery. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are outlined in enormous detail before scripting: "Once we have the 
premise, the next thing that we want to know is the finish," he said. "Then you 
know how to get there. Say that we're constructing a 'Matlock' story. We work 
out the murder. We work out who the suspects are. And then we jump to the end 
and say, 'Well, what's the finish? What's the finish clue?' " 
</P>
<P>
The "Perry Masons" are especially by-the-book mysteries: "They have to be. It's 
a tradition. You now only have a society of people who pay a lot of attention 
to 'Perry Mason' but the Erle Stanley Gardner estate is very specific about 
maintaining those traditional elements. We send them copies of the scripts and 
the shows." 
</P>
<P>
The approach is taking a personality and designing the show for him, "because 
if we feel we can get the right character married to the right star then we 
have a chance of doing something that's going to be popular." 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments are made. "Jake and the Fatman," for example. 
</P>
<P>
"It's changed radically," he said. "It started out telling what we call open 
mysteries, where you saw the killers in advance. We tried to play it slightly 
film noirish. We used old standards for all the song titles, integrated them 
into the musical underscore for each episode. Then, when the show was renewed, 
part of the condition was that we take it to Hawaii. Then the show changed and 
became a much more straight-forward cop show." 
</P>
<P>
After a zillion shows, how does he keep from going back to the same old well 
for ideas? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess that's a question you can ask almost anybody who does a series. 
When you hit the 90th episode or beyond, you have to try not to get stale. What 
we try to do on 'Matlock' is to vary the format of the show, or bend it a 
little bit, do variations on the central them, so that we're not to hidebound 
that it becomes overly familiar to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good question. It's one that we ask ourselves quite a bit and I guess 
what happens is we get attracted to ideas that are off form simply because we 
want to avoid repeating ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hargrove and his troops have had to throw out virtually completed 
episodes because they just couldn't make the twisted mystery work to any 
reasonable degree of logic. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his achievements in murder and mystery, he wants to do a comedy 
series: "At the moment, we're dealing with everything we've got. But at that 
point where we sit down to start doing some new development, which would 
probably be next year, that's certainly going to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever eventuates, in the world of TV programming, you never get too distant 
from humble. 
</P>
<P>
He had one lesson one day during an audition. One young man said it was good to 
see Hargrove again; Hargrove had hired him for his first TV acting job five 
years ago on a TV movie, "Goldie and the Bears." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove paled, as if someone had kicked him in the gut: "Oh my god," he said, 
"that goes back." 
</P>
<P>
They exchanged niceties. The actor did well enough on his reading (but not well 
enough to get cast). When he left everybody wanted to know about "Goldie and 
the Bears." 
</P>
<P>
"I blocked it all out," Hargrove said. "Something you don't want to be reminded 
of. . . . It was Warner Bros. I got assigned to it." 
</P>
<P>
The plot: Three former Chicago Bears players and the detective daughter of 
their dead coach take on a hot case of spies and murderers. Starring Stephanie 
Faracy, Ben Davidson, Terry Hogan, Julius J. Carry III and Thomas Rhiner. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon wanted to see a cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove wanted to change the subject: "Nothing's available on that one."
