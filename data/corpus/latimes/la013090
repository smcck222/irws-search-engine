OCEANSIDE MURALS ARE NO STRANGERS TO HARD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a time of despair and humiliation, a gregarious sign painter named Emanuel 
Osuna brought Oceanside some beauty and serenity. The question now is whether 
that gift will survive. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the murals Osuna painted during the Great Depression are slowly rotting 
in storage while the city searches for money to repair some or all of the 16 
panels that old-timers remember with a certain bittersweetness. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Osuna's 1938 scenic oils harken to the dark days when the local bank 
collapsed, businesses abruptly folded and about the only people with steady 
work were ranch hands. 
</P>
<P>
"People were working for $2 a day, and they'd get maybe three days' work a 
week," said Ernie Taylor, who was then a city engineer and remembers Osuna. 
"The city didn't have any money. Nobody had any money." 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, the grandson of San Diego's first mayor, Juan Maria Osuna, was 
struggling as a commercial sign painter when Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal 
created the Work Progress Administration that, among other things, put artists 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside City Council commissioned Osuna to paint 8-by-4-foot murals 
depicting mostly local scenes. The panels were placed inside the Oceanside Pier 
Dining Room, where "they attracted a lot of attention. They were kind of 
uplifting pictures," recalled Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But, over time, the placid scenes of the then-pastoral San Luis Rey Valley, 
snowy Palomar Observatory, Torrey Pines, the eastern desert and other subjects 
became tortured by the sea climate. Several have holes so big they look like 
they were kicked by a mule. 
</P>
<P>
The panels were put into storage five years ago, when the dining room was 
converted into a lifeguard headquarters, and the city has scrounged in vain for 
the $96,000 needed to repair them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very sentimental to Oceanside," said Betty Harding, a City Council 
aide in charge of the restoration project. "Everybody needs some heritage. Moms 
and dads and grandparents can say, 'Do you remember when you were a child and 
we took you to the pier dining room?' " 
</P>
<P>
More than nostalgia, the paintings show a vanished age, when Oceanside numbered 
only 3,000 folks (contrasted with 125,000 today) and the once-tiny tourist town 
had rolling open spaces and an original breezy California dreaminess. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of how it used to be," said John Steiger, who, as a teen-ager, 
knew Osuna. In one panel, "you could look out at the San Luis Rey Valley and 
see the hills. You look out now and people are growing there." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Engel, a Del Mar art conservator whom Oceanside consulted about saving 
Osuna's work, said much of the WPA art depicted "socialist themes" from the 
perspective of workers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Osuna's pieces took a strictly regional view, venerating natural beauty and 
symbols of the past, such as San Luis Rey Mission, while saying nothing about 
politics or the social condition. 
</P>
<P>
"They're quite charming and competently painted and important to Oceanside 
because they show the area in 1938," Engel said. She praised Osuna's 
composition, use of light and "atmospheric quality." 
</P>
<P>
Osuna wasn't and isn't famous. The Oceanside Library contains only a brief 
reference to him. In the 1940s, he moved to Los Angeles and, for a number of 
years, worked as a salesman for a paint company. Other than that, little is 
known about him. Even his cousin, Barbara Osuna Lange, lost touch. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"He was, how would you say it, a gentleman and he was proud of his work," said 
Steiger. "He was also proud of his Spanish heritage." Steiger and others 
describe Osuna as friendly and outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
His cousin remembers him as a kindly man, lanky, with glasses and a thin 
mustache. She saw him painting one of the panels but doesn't know whether he 
ever again undertook a major work. For the most part, she said, he "painted 
little scenes on gourds and on pottery dishes and sold them." 
</P>
<P>
Osuna's murals, even the ones best preserved, are in sorry condition. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of flaking paint," Engel said. "They're very dirty and grimy. 
They could be stabilized and made to look much better." 
</P>
<P>
That brings the topic back to money. The council, spurred on by Councilwoman 
Lucy Chavez, applied but failed to win a federal grant for restoration. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to recruit the local historical society to launch what Harding called an 
"adopt-a-panel" program is being discussed. The council will soon decide 
whether to restore all 16 panels or only 12, abandoning the most damaged among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, who is buried in Oceanside, died the year before efforts began in 1983 
to save and display his works.

HARTSON PARAMEDICS SET TO STRIKE IN FEBRUARY; CITY MEDIATION LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego paramedics will strike next month unless they reach agreement on a 
contract with Hartson Medical Services, union officials said Monday, amid 
increasing signs that a settlement in the lengthy labor dispute will be 
impossible without help from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that, sooner or later, the city will be directly involved in the 
talks because of the impending threat to public safety," Councilman Wes Pratt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides are still negotiating and have three bargaining sessions 
scheduled through next week, Eliseo Medina, president of the Service Employees 
International Union, Local 102, set a Feb. 14 strike date for about 160 
paramedics employed by the city. The union voted 129 to 22 last week to 
authorize a walkout, as a state mediator attempted to help both sides reach 
agreement on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's discouraging to have a strike deadline set in the midst of mediation. We 
thought we were making good progress," Hartson spokeswoman Sharon Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Medina said union negotiators are frustrated by lack of progress on two major 
issues -- wages and the rehiring of two Hartson's employees who the union 
contends were illegally fired for union activities. The company said both men 
were fired for willfully failing to respond to a call within the 10 minutes 
required by the city. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held outside City Hall, Medina said that Hartson 
negotiators are not offering an adequate wage package for paramedics or 
emergency medical technicians (EMTs) represented by the union. Paramedics earn 
$6.50 to $9.55 an hour, while EMTs start at $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Medina declined to provide specifics about the union's wage demands but said 
its bargaining team is asking $8 an hour starting wage for paramedics. 
According to union figures, San Diego paramedics are the lowest paid in the 
county, earning an average 24% less than those in other jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have said that Hartson will probably have to go back to the City 
Council and ask for a subsidy in order to raise employee salaries. But Medina 
said the union wants the company to first make its books available to the 
union's accountants to see if Hartson can afford to give the wage increases 
without asking for more money from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, chairman of the City Council's Public Services and Safety Committee, 
said the council has not been kept up-to-date on the labor dispute, but he did 
not rule out the possibility of the city giving Hartson extra funds so the 
company can settle with the union. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's something that we should consider, then we should listen to what 
they say. But, at this point, I'm not willing to say we should go along with it 
because we don't have all the facts," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartson has a $6.8-million paramedic contract with San Diego that expires in 
June, 1991. In addition, the company is also allowed to charge patients up to 
$281 a call. The average per-call rate in the rest of the county is $400, said 
Glen Roberts, Hartson's chief executive officer. In an interview last week, 
Roberts estimated the total value of the contract over four years at $27 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's contract, Hartson hires the paramedics and dispatchers. The 
city owns the ambulances and emergency equipment, but the company maintains the 
vehicles. Unlike other cities, San Diego does not allow emergency medical 
technicians to work with paramedics. The city's contract requires both 
emergency personnel in an ambulance to be certified paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Medina said he is willing to ask the City Council to approve a subsidy for 
Hartson if necessary to avert a strike. He added that Hartson negotiators have 
sounded the union out about approaching the council together. 
</P>
<P>
"They broached that possibility. From our perspective, we will do whatever 
necessary to get paramedics the wage increases they need. We would support any 
plan to get the money," said Medina. 
</P>
<P>
Hartson spokeswoman Henry echoed Medina's comments but said the company was 
caught off-guard by the union's strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We had put together a packet that they supported in terms of going to the city 
and asking for help. We agreed to turn to the city and ask for help in 
resolving this together. I thought that was pretty well on its way. I don't 
know what happened to cause this to deteriorate," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a walkout, the union has offered to let the paramedics work for 
the city without pay. Although Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton has 
rejected the union's offer, Councilman John Hartley said Monday that the city 
should consider it along with other alternatives. Stapleton advocates replacing 
striking paramedics with off-duty firefighters, who say they are unqualified to 
work as paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
"The really important thing is that the high level of service we have now 
should be continued, no matter what happens. I think that the union's plan 
should be considered as well as any other plan," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt also said he is worried about the quality of emergency care provided to 
the public in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"My major concern is the safety of the citizens and providing adequate 
emergency services. I want something worked out. I don't want to see a 
situation where an innocent person dies because of a labor impasse," Pratt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the union also delivered a letter to Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who is 
now in the Soviet Union, asking her to allow Local 102 officials to address the 
City Council on Feb. 6, so the group can explain its position.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON MUST DIP INTO SAVINGS TO MEET BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson will have to take $5.5 million from its reserves to meet a $34.8-million 
budget that three council members approved last week, since revenues are 
projected to be only $29.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was passed with the fiscal year more than half over, will 
leave the city with reserves of only $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city expects to begin receiving $1 million during the next fiscal 
year from special revenues allocated by the Legislature to cities with low 
property taxes or none. 
</P>
<P>
The plan represents a 16% increase over last year's budget. A major increase 
came in the $2.2-million capital budget, much of which is to go for 
construction in Veterans Park.

<P>
A man was found bludgeoned to death Monday in his Los Feliz apartment and 
police arrested two suspects, but one escaped, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers went to the man's apartment in the 4400 block of Ambrose Avenue 
shortly after 10 a.m. after stopping two suspects carrying identification with 
the victim's address, Detective Sam Jacobellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang officers had stopped the car in which they were riding in a probe of 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's identity was not immediately released. He was believed to be in 
his 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Suspected gang members Herman Gonzalez, 27, and Robert Luna, 30, were arrested 
and booked on suspicion of murder at the Northeast Division station. But when 
detectives went to a holding area of the station to interview Gonzalez about 
12:30 p.m., they found he had escaped, police said. Details of his escape were

COUNTY, LANCASTER SUE STATE IN EFFORT TO HALT PRISON PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: RESIDENTS FEAR THE FACILITY WOULD BURDEN WATER, COURTS AND OTHER 
SERVICES. GOV. DEUKMEJIAN COUNTERS THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS NO PRISON BUT 
CONTRIBUTES 40% OF THE PRISON POPULATION. 
</P>

<P>
The city of Lancaster and Los Angeles County filed lawsuits Monday to block 
construction of a state prison in Lancaster, arguing that the state had not 
conducted an adequate environmental review and that the legislation involved is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The city's suit was filed in Lancaster Superior Court. It alleges that state 
Department of Corrections Director James Rowland and other officials violated 
state environmental laws by failing to examine the prison's full social, 
economic and environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
State officials did not sufficiently consult with city leaders opposed to the 
project and failed to consider alternative sites in the Antelope Valley because 
they were biased in favor of approving the site in west Lancaster, the suit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental impact review was nothing more than a document designed to 
justify a decision that had already been made," said Lancaster City Attorney 
David McEwen, who drafted the suit. It requests an immediate halt to planning 
for the 2,200-bed, maximum- and medium-security prison. Construction is to 
begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate suit filed in Los Angeles on behalf of the county and Supervisor 
Michael Antonovich, who represents the Lancaster area, county lawyers argue 
that the environmental review did not consider that the prison will prevent the 
county from expanding adjacent health and law enforcement facilities needed in 
the fast-growing valley. The prison site is owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole purpose of the suit is to persuade the state, either through 
logic and common sense or through pressing the suit itself, to change its 
mind," said Antonovich spokesman Dawson Oppenheimer. He said Antonovich favors 
construction of the prison on state-owned land in Hungry Valley, near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Corrections officials declined to comment on the lawsuits because 
they had not seen them. But department spokesman Mike Van Winkle defended the 
environmental review, which took two years to complete. "We stand behind it and 
we feel it is an outstanding document," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Gov. George Deukmejian criticized county supervisors for their 
decision to sue. He said Los Angeles County has a responsibility to provide 
prison space because nearly 40% of state prison inmates come from the county, 
which has no prisons. He accused prison opponents of endangering the stability 
of the overcrowded state penal system with frivolous legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Both suits say state officials failed to respond to widespread community 
opposition in Lancaster, where some residents fear that a prison would hurt the 
economy and burden government services, especially the court system. They 
contend it would strain the water supply and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
The suits also attack Senate Bill 18, the 1987 "pain-for-pain" compromise in 
which legislators agreed to permit a prison in heavily Democratic East Los 
Angeles sought by Gov. Deukmejian if another prison is built in the heavily 
Republican Antelope Valley. Earlier this month, the city of Los Angeles joined 
community activists in suing to stop the East Los Angeles prison. 
</P>
<P>
By authorizing two prisons on two sites paid for through separate 
appropriations, the suits say, Senate Bill 18 violates a state constitutional 
requirement that legislation be limited to a single subject. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county suit maintains that corrections officials arbitrarily 
and unreasonably denied Lancaster residents due process. The state gave critics 
of the East Los Angeles site preferential treatment over the Lancaster site by 
establishing tougher standards for approval of the East Los Angeles site, 
including creation of an independent review panel, the county suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Until the suit over the East Los Angeles site is resolved, the Lancaster 
project should be suspended, the suit argues. To continue could be a waste of 
money, it says, because the legislation prohibits operation of either prison 
until the other is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is that that in itself is a flaw in the bill because it sets up a 
tremendous potential waste of taxpayer funds," said Helen Parker, senior deputy 
county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation calls for expedited hearing of any legal challenges to the 
environmental review, lawyers said. A hearing date for the lawsuit and 
accompanying request for an injunction must be requested within the next 45 
days.

GARBAGE PILES TOO HIGH, SUIT CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
DUMPS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE RESIDENTS SAY MOUNDS OF DEBRIS AT LOPEZ CANYON 
LANDFILL ARE TOO TALL. THEY WANT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO SHIFT OPERATIONS TO 
AN UNUSED AREA.

<P>
Escalating their campaign against Los Angeles' only municipal garbage dump, a 
group of San Fernando Valley residents filed suit Monday against the city, 
alleging that trash is being piled too high. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Superior Court, asks that the city be forced to begin 
dumping in a unused area of the Lopez Canyon Landfill instead of continuing to 
increase the height of a mound at the current dump site, located above Lake 
View Terrace. A hearing on the suit is scheduled for Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference at the landfill's gate, Lake View Terrace resident 
Lewis Snow -- one of three plaintiffs in the suit -- described the growing 
mound as "a guillotine blade waiting to fall." Snow said residents fear a 
repeat of a 1983 incident, in which a section of the dump collapsed in heavy 
rainstorms, pouring trash into the back yards and streets of neighboring Kagel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters brought a humorous touch to their complaints. A Kagel Canyon 
artist, Michael Wilson, donned a rubber suit covered with black lumps to 
portray what he called "the dump monster." Longtime Lake View Terrace activist 
Eileen Barry said that if efforts to limit dump operations are unsuccessful, 
she will advertise "Ski Lopez Canyon, the highest peak in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, an engineer for the city Bureau of Sanitation defended 
landfill operations, saying the current landfill elevation -- trash reaching 
1,768 feet above sea level -- is within safety limits approved by the county 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dump's original state permit called for a limit of 1,660 feet, an 
estimated elevation of 1,740 "plus surcharge" is mentioned in documents the 
city submitted to the state Waste Management Board in 1983. Last year, the 
state failed in a lawsuit to force the city to comply with the lower height 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
City sanitation engineer Malcolm Toy said that 30 feet is a reasonable estimate 
of "surcharge," a term used to describe the additional height expected to be 
offset by settling -- giving the city a ceiling 2 feet higher than the present 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Toy also said the city started dumping some trash in the previously unused 
landfill area on Jan. 24 and will begin to use that area exclusively after Feb. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, a group of northeast Valley residents calling themselves 
CUSTOM -- Communities United for Safe Trash Management -- have been waging a 
fight against the landfill. They oppose a proposed dump expansion, which would 
double its capacity and keep it open far beyond a projected 1992 closure date. 
</P>
<P>
They have staged numerous protests at the dump gates and twice blocked garbage 
trucks from entering. Robert Zapple, a member of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn., 
said CUSTOM members decided to file a lawsuit after the protests failed to 
hinder dump operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a natural escalation of what had to happen in the community," Zapple 
said. "Shutting them down for a day just does not do any good." 
</P>
<P>
The residents have repeatedly complained about dust, noise and odors emanating 
from the dump. On Monday, Zapple said bad smells have not dissipated despite a 
landfill gas collection system that began operating earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is not doing the job," Zapple said. 
</P>
<P>
Toy acknowledged that the gas collection system is not perfect, but he said the 
city will continue refining it.

WITNESS IN DROWNING LIED, DEFENSE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A witness who testified against two women accused in the drowning death of a 
17-year-old high school classmate lied to keep from being implicated in the 
crime, defense attorneys argued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Eva Chirumbolo, the key prosecution witness in the case 
against Karen Severson and Laura Doyle, was designed to divert attention from 
her own involvement in the death, defense attorney Charles Lloyd said during 
his closing arguments in the 2-week Pasadena Superior Court murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Severson and Doyle, both 22 and from Arleta, are accused of drowning Michele 
Avila in a creek in the Big Tujunga Canyon area of Angeles National Forest on 
Oct. 1, 1985, after claiming she slept with their boyfriends, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Chirumbolo did not tell Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators about the 
events surrounding the slaying until three years after the death. Chirumbolo, 
who has not been charged with a crime, testified that she did not come forward 
earlier because she feared for her life. She changed her mind, she said, after 
the suicide of her 18-year-old brother made her realize the grief the Avila 
family was experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
But Lloyd argued Monday that Chirumbolo came forward with her story after 
hearing rumors tying her to Avila's death. Lloyd referred to testimony from 
Kymi Keel, a mutual friend of the women, that Chirumbolo and Avila had been in 
a fight weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
The fight, Lloyd noted, centered on Avila's popularity with Chirumbolo's 
boyfriend, John Avril. "It is obscene that Eva Chirumbolo is not charged with 
this killing," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lloyd and Severson's attorney, Harold Vites, also argued that because 
Chirumbolo had not witnessed the killing, it was impossible for the jury to 
find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamia Hope dismissed both arguments, saying Chirumbolo had 
no reason to lie. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not an accomplice to this crime," Hope said of Chirumbolo. "If she was 
really involved, why didn't she just keep quiet? Eva Chirumbolo was touched and 
traumatized by the death of her brother and finally decided to come forward and 
tell what she knew." 
</P>
<P>
Chirumbolo testified that she accompanied her friends to the creek near Colby 
Canyon Ranch but was not present when Avila's death occurred. She said Severson 
and Doyle had argued with Avila, accusing her of having slept with their 
boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Doyle stepped into the creek and Severson pushed Avila toward 
Doyle, who grabbed Avila by the wrist and pulled her into the water, Chirumbolo 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Chirumbolo said she became frightened and ran back to where the cars were 
parked. A few minutes later, Doyle and Severson joined her, and Severson jumped 
into her car and drove off, Chirumbolo said. 
</P>
<P>
When she got into the car with Doyle, Chirumbolo said, Doyle told her that she 
and Severson had killed Avila. 
</P>
<P>
Jury deliberations are to begin today. Severson and Doyle are being tried as 
adults, although Severson was 17 at the time of the crime. If convicted, they 
face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RUNWAY CLOSED AFTER PLANE COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single-engine plane collapsed on a Burbank Airport runway Monday when its 
landing gear gave way on takeoff, briefly delaying three arriving planes that 
had to be diverted to another runway, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and lone occupant of the Piper Comanche was not injured in the 11:05 
a.m. incident, Burbank Airport spokesman Victor Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had just taxied into position for a northbound takeoff when it 
collapsed on the south end of the north-south runway, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known what caused the landing gear to give way, he said. Other 
flights were diverted to the east-west runway while a crane hoisted the plane 
off the runway, which was reopened about noon, Gill said. No departing aircraft 
were delayed, he said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEETINGS TO FOCUS ON COVERING RESERVOIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of nine public meetings will be held Thursday in Sun Valley on a 
multimillion-dollar proposal to cover city water supply reservoirs to reduce 
the risk of contamination, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. in the multipurpose room of Byrd 
Junior High School, 9171 Telfair Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley will also be the site of the ninth and final meeting, 
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 27 in the cafeteria of Canoga Park High School, 
6850 Topanga Canyon Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is considering alternative ways to protect 10 open reservoirs within 
the city to improve water quality. Although DWP water meets applicable health 
regulations, the proposal comes "in response to increased customer concern 
about water quality, and to emerging stricter state and federal water quality 
standards," said Duane Georgeson, DWP assistant general manager for water. 
</P>
<P>
The nine public meetings are intended to get public input to guide preparation 
of an environmental impact report that will analyze alternative ways to protect 
the reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of permanent covers is one of the alternatives. Other options 
include taking reservoirs out of service and replacing them with storage tanks, 
and building filtration plants near open reservoirs for water disinfection. 
</P>
<P>
The four biggest reservoirs -- the 158-acre Encino Reservoir and the Silver 
Lake, Lower Stone Canyon, and Lower Hollywood reservoirs -- will not be 
covered, the DWP said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to cover the reservoirs have sparked opposition on aesthetic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The evening meetings will be preceded at 7 p.m. by an open house with 
refreshments to allow time for informal discussion with DWP staff, water 
officials said.

<P>
One man died after falling from a cliff about 200 yards north of Scripps Pier, 
and a woman was in serious condition Monday after falling partway down while 
trying to reach him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Marisa-Ann Ortiz, 21, and Jeffrey Alan Sardina, 22, had spent Sunday evening on 
the UC San Diego campus with a friend, Scott Douglas Simon, and the three ended 
up at the cliffs about 12:30 a.m., campus police said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon told campus police that, about 2:30 a.m., he tired and went to the car to 
sleep. He woke up about 4 a.m., just as Ortiz approached and said she could not 
find Sardina. 
</P>
<P>
Simon and Ortiz searched the cliff for about 20 minutes, then returned to the 
car. About 6 a.m., they searched the area again and spotted Sardina's body 
about 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Simon left to call the campus police, leaving Ortiz behind. 
</P>
<P>
When rescue workers arrived about 8:15 a.m., they saw Sardina's body, and Ortiz 
was found about 25 feet from the bottom of the 175-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Allan Macdonald of the San Diego Fire Department said firefighters 
rappelled the cliff to reach the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz was taken by helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla. She was 
in the surgical intensive-care unit with a broken pelvis, internal injuries and 
cuts, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
George Dickason, county deputy coroner, said Sardina lived at 3048 Renault St., 
San Diego. An autopsy is pending. YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ

A four-alarm fire raged at the Carmel Highland Country Club Monday night, San 
Diego Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze started at the club, in the 14000 block of Penasquitos Drive, about 
8:15 p.m. As they worked to contain the flames, authorities closed the roads at 
Penasquitos Drive and Carmel Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 members of the Fire Department were called in to battle the fire, 
which reached the club's roof. Authorities were unable to determine how the 
blaze began or the extent of the damage late Monday night.

TRUMP'S PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In commenting on Trump's lofty scheme for the old Ambassador site (Part A, Jan. 
16), Robert A. Jones suggests the project overcome the ranking that has so long 
plagued L.A. Boosterism: "biggest west of the Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
It can be done! -- by turning to advantage an equally onerous pricing policy, 
"slightly higher West of the Rockies" (which even today sometimes crops up in 
an ad in the New Yorker). All it takes is a towering building whose upper 
stories are mounted on giant jacks. They would thrust Los Angeles' masterpiece 
slightly higher than any other building, any other place, which tried to 
surmount it. 
</P>
<P>
It would be called, of course, the Wild Jack.

ART NOT FOR POLITICIANS' SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From its beginning last year, the controversy created by Sen. Jesse Helms' 
attack on the National Endowment for the Arts has had very little to do with 
aesthetics and a great deal to do with politics. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever contested the notion that the endowment ought to consider the 
intention, content and context of the projects proposed by artists and arts 
organizations seeking federal financial support. The real question was -- and 
is -- will that consideration be undertaken by artists and arts professionals 
acting according to the criteria of aesthetic excellence or will it be 
undertaken by politicians acting according to political standards? The former 
approach is the one the NEA always has employed; imposition of the latter is 
what many suspected Helms really had in mind when he assailed federal grants to 
a pair of controversial photography exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Such suspicions now seem well-founded. As Times writer Allan Parachini reported 
Monday, the conservative North Carolina Republican has quietly attempted to 
inject himself directly into the endowment's deliberations. In four letters 
sent to NEA officials late last year, Helms demanded unusually detailed 
information on grants made to eight specific arts organizations and nine 
individual artists, presumably because they presented or produced work dealing 
with AIDS or erotic subjects. The senator also solicited a grant for an art 
education project in his state, and urged NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer to 
hire a Helms supporter as the endowment's chief lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer must not give in to this sort of unwholesome political meddling. He 
must hold to the standard he laid down last week in remarks to NEA employees: 
"All points of view expressed in excellent art should be encouraged and 
supported, and (federal) grants should not be proscribed because of partisan or 
doctrinal disapproval." When artists look to the federal government, they ought 
to see the outstretched hand of a fair-minded benefactor and not the grim face 
of the Grand Inquisitor.

TRUMP'S PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be spectacular if Donald Trump actually does build the world's tallest 
skyscraper on the Ambassador Hotel property (Part A, Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
At first I agreed with Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that Trump's proposed 
building would be inappropriate and out of scale for that area. 
</P>
<P>
But after thinking about it, it occurs to me that the Eiffel Tower is certainly 
"out of scale" in its Paris neighborhood; the Empire State Building was "out of 
scale" when it was built more than a half century ago, and isn't that Tower in 
Pisa "out of scale"? And weren't these buildings the object of scorn, ridicule 
and opposition when first proposed? Yet, Paris, New York and Pisa just wouldn't 
be the same without them. 
</P>
<P>
The world's tallest building wouldn't be just another office building; it would 
be an attraction for the people of Los Angeles and tourists from around the 
world. That means far more tax dollars and jobs than another Arco twin-tower 
office complex which would contain the same number of square feet of office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that if Trump is serious, Los Angeles should encourage him to build 
our "Eiffel Tower" on Wilshire Boulevard.

Continual presentation of speculation as news regarding the disposition of 
Mikhail Gorbachev's political future in Moscow is disheartening. We hear this 
speculation, reprinted in our newspapers, from the lips of Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney and not from any other reputable source. 
</P>
<P>
Must we not also consider that Cheney has a vested interest in a Gorbachev 
failure? Why must the proponents of our military-industrial complex continually 
bombard us with dark propaganda? Can we not applaud political change in Eastern 
Europe and Soviet Asia, however violent, and consider that change a sign of a 
good future?

COURT DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court justices now have decided that a schoolteacher is not 
entitled to damages, even though they agree he was the victim of "malicious 
prosecution" (Part A, Jan. 23). This means that public officials basically can 
prosecute at will without fear of the consequences of their actions. 
</P>
<P>
This creates a whole new class of victims among those who are falsely accused. 
The teacher in this case reportedly spent more than $90,000 defending himself, 
yet the court reasoned that he suffered no deprivation because "he was 
acquitted, not imprisoned." 
</P>
<P>
News flash to the court: Most citizens don't have $90,000 to throw away 
whenever some incompetent or malicious public official feels like enhancing his 
or her publicity value or career status by prosecuting an easy target. We 
cannot ensure before the fact that officials will be ethical and fair. Now we 
cannot hope for punishment and recompense after the fact, either.

In response to "Hard Heads and Tender Hearts for L.A." by Mark Ridley Thomas 
(Op-Ed Page, Jan. 15), I simply ask the question, where has this guy been? 
</P>
<P>
His reference to the community being duped on the proposed county jail for 
South-Central Los Angeles is slanderous to the community and speaks volumes 
about his lack of regard for people of South Los Angeles to reason and make 
intelligent decisions without his divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Either he is ill-advised, uninformed, not in line with the community he's 
supposed to serve or all of the aforementioned. 
</P>
<P>
For Mr. Ridley-Thomas' information, the 2,000-bed jail was and still is a 
legitimate proposal being studied by the county Board of Supervisors. The 
proposal in its current form is designed to be built in the middle of 
South-Central Los Angeles. The proposed jail will be built near elementary 
schools. The proposal requires 29 to 40 acres of vacant land that is not 
available in the community, therefore, condemnation would be necessary, which 
means people in the community would lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
He should get involved with this issue and show some of that leadership he 
wrote about. It's not too late because, contrary to what he wrote in his 
article, the issue unfortunately is still very much alive!

REAL CONCERNS AMID THE HEADY TALK;

JAPAN: THE PRIME MINISTER WENT TO EUROPE LOOKING FOR VOTES BACK HOME, BUT IT'S 
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICA THAT WILL SUFFER IF HE DOESN'T GET THEM.

<TEXT>
<P>
The real campaigning for Japan's Feb. 18 general election began three weeks ago 
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's "typhoon tour" of Europe's capital cities. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu came to Europe with his Liberal Democrat government in its deepest mess 
in 35 years. He wanted not only to appear statesmanlike to the viewers back 
home, but also to establish a bridgehead of trust to Eastern Europe. He 
succeeded in the first aim, but the heady talk of international cooperation to 
revitalize Eastern Europe could come to nothing if his party loses to a 
markedly more populist, protectionist and emotional opposition coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the election will not be fought over Europe. Although the Japanese 
enjoyed the news from Berlin and Prague, their priorities at the polls are 
three major issues with ramifications for the Japan-U.S. relationship: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 3% consumption tax introduced last April. Its bungled introduction left 
consumers feeling betrayed by broken promises and stung by an unfair and 
unnecessary levy. The consumer revolt cost the Liberal Democrats their Upper 
House majority in the summer. This election, too, will be something of a 
referendum on the issue -- the Liberal Democrats want to keep a revised version 
of the tax, the opposition wants it scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is significant to the United States. Extra tax revenue frees cash to 
satisfy military burden-sharing demands. It also allows greater spending on 
welfare, which reduces the need for savings, thus leading to more consumer 
spending and more imports, according to the U.S. argument at the Structural 
Impediments Initiative talks, the American-Japanese forum aimed at opening up 
the Japanese economy and improving life for Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rice-import liberalization and the "food security" question, which Japan is 
promoting before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japanese farmers 
have resisted Liberal Democrat efforts to wean them off subsidies; the 
opposition parties back the farmers. Washington has already won large 
concessions on the import of oranges and beef. Rice now stands as a final point 
of principle before the whole Japanese market is opened. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The territorial dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union. Failure to 
decide the sovereignty of four small islands and to sign a peace treaty with 
Moscow keep the door closed on Far East detente and deny wholehearted Japanese 
backing to Western efforts to shore up Mikhail Gorbachev. Voters, traditionally 
hostile to the Soviet Union, see this issue in mainly emotional and patriotic 
terms. But Washington will continue to be concerned with what is increasingly 
seen as an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
America's interests in this election are best represented by the Liberal 
Democrats. Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador, has publicly criticized the 
Japan Socialist Party's new defense policy, acknowledging that an outright 
opposition victory would lead to a long period of debate about the future of 
the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the status of South Korea, whose government 
is not recognized by the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
The next round of negotiations on the Structural Impediments Initiative has 
already been postponed by Japan until after the general election, and it is 
unlikely that a new Socialist government would give the talks a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, speculation about an opposition victory would have been 
dismissed by most people in Japan. The mood has now changed, and even senior 
Liberal Democrat politicians recognize that the result will be close. Either of 
the two most likely results, a slim Liberal Democrat majority or a coalition 
government headed by the Socialists, will simply prolong the domestic political 
stalemate. Europe, and the widening circle of Japanese aid recipients, would 
like to see a strong and stable government in Tokyo. But of Japan's 
international relationships, that with the United States will be damaged the 
most by indecisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Europe served Kaifu's purposes well. If he wins the election, he will find more 
serious European questions occupying ever more of his time. But in order to 
pass the election hurdle, he must first win the argument for more liberal and 
internationalist policies at home. 
</P>
<P>
If he fails, the stagnation that threatens to set in after Feb. 18 will hit the 
United States the hardest.

LACK OF SKILLS LEADS TO VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: HOW CAN WE EXPECT TO END UNNECESSARY CITIZEN-POLICE SHOOTINGS 
IF OFFICERS ARE INADEQUATELY TRAINED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES J. FYFE, James J. Fyfe is a professor of justice at the American 
University in Washington and a former New York City police officer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, no matter how appropriately police act, the people they deal with 
leave them no choice but to kill or be killed. Conversely, in many cases, no 
matter how badly police behave, nobody is hurt because citizens give officers 
lots of leeway. 
</P>
<P>
Condemning police for killing in life-or-death situations is an act of 
betrayal. Overlooking sloppy or inappropriate police work because it has not 
resulted in immediate violence reinforces mistakes that will eventually hurt 
somebody. 
</P>
<P>
Critics should also recognize the distinction between extralegal violence and 
unnecessary violence. Extralegal violence is intentional and brutal. It is the 
beating in the back of the police station, the unjustifiable shooting that is 
whitewashed. It is tough to determine how often extralegal violence occurs 
because it involves officers who take care to see that their wrongful acts 
occur out of public view. My sense, however, is that it has all but disappeared 
from American policing. 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary violence is different. It occurs when well-meaning officers lack 
the skills to resolve problems without resorting to violence. In the worst 
cases, they put themselves in trouble and then must shoot their way out of it. 
Thus, when analyzing police shootings, we should not be quick to approve 
officers' actions merely because their lives were in imminent danger the 
instant they pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of viewing shootings as still pictures in which the instant of shooting 
can be separated from all that went before, we should view them as movies that 
begin when officers become aware that they are about to confront potentially 
violent situations. When we do this, we can determine whether inappropriate 
actions by the officers may have made it inevitable that their "movies" would 
end in shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Extralegal violence can be minimized fairly easily. Police departments try to 
do so by hiring only the best people, by supervising them carefully and by 
holding them accountable for their actions. On occasion, however, extralegal 
police violence has been tolerated -- or even encouraged -- by police leaders. 
In such cases, citizens must eliminate the extralegal violence; sue the 
rascals, and throw them out of office. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of unnecessary violence is much more difficult. It is inadvertent 
and public, and it usually appears in the press just as it happened. Also, 
while no reasonable person can offer justification for extralegal violence, 
police officials find it difficult to criticize unnecessary violence. It is one 
thing to condemn a cop who has beaten a confession out of a prisoner, but a 
police chief who criticizes an officer whose own life was at risk in a 
situation that led to unnecessary violence leaves himself open to charges of 
"Monday morning quarterbacking." Even though unnecessary violence is not 
intentional or sinister, media coverage and police defense of such action have 
made it a great source of friction between police and the community. 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary violence is a sign that officers are inadequately prepared to deal 
with the wide variety of people and problems we assign them to confront. The 
police are human-service workers who must deal with everybody -- white, black, 
brown, yellow, red, sober, drunk, high, young, old, rich, poor, crazy, nasty. 
Worse, they must do it now, out on the street and, often, in front of third 
parties who are quick to make judgments. Officers answering street calls cannot 
refer their cases to specialists, or to people who relate better to their 
client. 
</P>
<P>
No other human-service worker confronts the variety or volatility of problems 
at the heart of everyday police work. Yet the training in even the most 
sophisticated police departments is a fraction of that required of social 
workers, schoolteachers, psychologists or lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
From my seat 3,000 miles away, I would not presume to make judgments about the 
recent violence in Los Angeles involving members of the Nation of Islam and law 
enforcement officers. I do know, however, that many of the tragedies that come 
out of police work involve unskilled officers rather than evil officers. Until 
we acknowledge that, and until we demand that our police officers' skills be 
honed by training and preparation more comparable to that provided social 
workers, schoolteachers, psychologists and lawyers, we have little hope of 
reducing unnecessary police-citizen violence.

NIBBLING FEEBLY AT THE TOES OF A GIANT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH'S RHETORIC AND THE TINY IDEAS 
IN HIS NEW FISCAL PLAN. BASIC NEEDS WILL REMAIN UNFULFILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The budget that President Bush sent to Congress Monday fulfills the motto of 
his Administration: When you see great challenges facing you, don't quibble. 
Nibble. 
</P>
<P>
When Ronald Reagan was President, you always had the feeling that he believed 
his own cliche: "Government isn't the answer to our problems; government is the 
problem." Bush knows better. He knows that there are problems no entrepreneur 
is going to solve at a profit and there are needs that no church bake-sale 
proceeds will meet. But after identifying these problems, he is content to 
nibble at the edges of them rather than grapple with both hands, as our great 
Presidents have done with the tests of their times. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guise of summoning the American public and members of both parties in 
the Democratic-controlled Congress to meet the demands of a new decade and a 
radically changing world, Bush once again has chosen to throw his immense 
popularity into the most minuscule of fights. The gap between Bush's own 
rhetoric and his resolve is awesome. 
</P>
<P>
That is the case on education, on transportation, on science, on research and 
development, on drugs and on crime. It is also notably the case when it comes 
to the basic obligation of any executive: financing the programs he proposes. 
The first budget for which Bush has full responsibility continues the pattern 
of systematic prevarication that has made people so cynical about Washington 
and its ways. 
</P>
<P>
If you accept Bush's golden economic-growth assumptions, and if you ignore the 
$200-billion-plus cost of the savings-and-loan bailout, and if you count the 
Social Security Trust Fund surplus against the unfunded annual operating 
budget, then you can get the deficit down to a "mere" $63 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality is different. The gross federal debt -- which includes 
obligations to Social Security and similar trust funds -- will actually rise by 
$1 trillion between 1989 and 1995 under the Bush blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
So much for discipline. 
</P>
<P>
As for needed public investment, the reality -- hidden in a back-of-the book 
table -- is this: In constant dollars, Bush is proposing only to keep federal 
spending on non-defense physical capital at the level of the 1980s. If you 
offset depreciation of aging equipment and facilities against investment, as 
any businessman would do, the net non-defense investment being proposed is just 
over half what it was in 1980 and less than two-thirds what Reagan thought 
adequate in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The sad thing is that Bush's nibbling approach sets the outer limits on what 
can be expected from Washington this year, barring some sort of external 
political or financial crisis. It is rarely the case that Congress, even when 
controlled by the opposition party, pushes a President much further than he is 
prepared to go. And this year is not likely to be the exception. 
</P>
<P>
This being an election year, the Democratic majority is preoccupied with 
getting its return ticket punched by the electorate. For most of them, that 
means staying away from fights with a President who enjoys favorable notices 
from almost 80% of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has already demonstrated in the most convincing manner possible that he is 
ready and eager to confront Congress when it challenges the policy he prefers. 
Last week's White House victory in sustaining Bush's veto of the Chinese 
student-residency relief bill showed that he could marshal Republican senators 
even in an unpopular and ignoble cause. Coming at the start of the session, it 
significantly strengthens Bush's chances of dominating the year's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
That is a marked change from last year. Except for the S&amp;L bill at the 
start of the year, Bush in 1989 was rarely able to compel Congress to put his 
agenda to the fore. As a result, he had to use his veto pen more often than did 
other new Presidents. And even with the successful vetoes, he experienced more 
defeats in Congress, according to Congressional Quarterly, than any newly 
elected President in the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk O'Donnell, a top House Democratic leadership aide when Thomas P. (Tip) 
O'Neill was Speaker, expects that Bush may be far more dominant in 1990 than he 
was in 1989. "He's approaching the second session of Congress the way most 
Presidents approach their first session," O'Donnell said. "His election did not 
give him a mandate vis-a-vis Congress, because he had no coattails. But now 
he'll use a year of steadily rising popularity . . . to prod and poke Congress 
to act on his agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, that agenda is so limited that Bush's influence becomes more of a 
barrier to meeting the nation's challenges than a catalyst for action. In the 
world of toothless politicians, the nibbler is king.

<P>
Quarterback Michael Wynn of San Fernando High School made an oral commitment 
Monday to attend San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, 6-feet-3, 205-pounds, said he also visited the University of Washington 
but cancelled trips to USC and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he has two cousins at SDSU -- redshirt freshmen George Glaze 
(defensive line) and Sebastian Glaze (linebacker) -- helped sway him, Wynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had insight into SDSU all season," Wynn said. "That made me feel more 
comfortable. I just didn't feel as comfortable at other schools." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn completed 53 of 140 passes (37.8%) last year for 726 yards and four 
touchdowns.

Ricardo Herrera, 6-4, 6-0, in No. 2 singles.

WYNN TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR SAN DIEGO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando High quarterback Michael Wynn has made an oral commitment to 
attend San Diego State after he visited the Western Athletic Conference school 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, 6-foot-3, 205 pounds, had visited Washington but canceled trips to 
Arizona State, Colorado and USC before choosing San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends said to me, 'Wow, you had a chance to go to USC,' but I just didn't 
feel the place was right for me. San Diego State felt like home," he said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's cousins, George and Sebastian Glaze, redshirted as freshmen in the fall 
and served as Wynn's hosts over the weekend. George was an offensive lineman in 
1988 at San Fernando and Sebastian played linebacker in '88 for Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State recruited Wynn as a quarterback while other schools had 
considered Wynn at defensive back or wide receiver. "All I want is a shot at 
quarterback and I feel I'll get a fair shake there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn entered the 1989 season as one of the most highly regarded players in the 
Valley area but endured a disappointing senior season. He completed 53 of 140 
passes (37.8%) for 726 yards and four touchdowns. The Tigers, who were 5-6 
overall, passed sparingly after they adopted the wishbone attack halfway 
through the season. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Wynn excelled in the team's multiple-set offense, completing 108 
of 209 passes (51.7%) for 1,614 yards and 24 touchdowns. JOHN LYNCH

When I told my husband I wanted to join a physical fitness club, he put his 
paper down. "What for?" he asked. "You stored the stationary bicycle in the 
garage, slipcovered the treadmill and made a planter out of the rowing 
exerciser." 
</P>
<P>
"The club has a stair-climbing machine," I said. 
</P>
<P>
He took off his glasses. "We moved out of a perfectly good house 10 years ago 
because you hated living in a two-story house with all those stairs." 
</P>
<P>
"That was different." 
</P>
<P>
"Your exact words were, 'If God had wanted me to ascend to the second floor, he 
would have awarded me frequent flier points.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you ever forget anything?" 
</P>
<P>
"Remember how you used to stack laundry at the bottom of the stairs and make 
one trip a year?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you finished?" 
</P>
<P>
"There were diapers in that pile the day the last kid graduated from high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
I should never have brought it up for discussion. I knew he wouldn't 
understand. I was young then. When you're young, you never think there's going 
to be a day when your derriere makes flapping noises on the backs of your knees 
when you walk. 
</P>
<P>
That's because men are built differently than women. They're flat. Men can 
sleep on their stomachs and the bed will still look as if it's made. They don't 
appreciate that any woman over 40 needs a stair climber to firm up muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget the benefits of muscle toning," I said. "A stair climber would 
accelerate my heart rate." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "Why don't you just look at our American Express bill from Christmas? 
I know you. You won't stick with it. You have the interest span of a 
2-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would you say a thing like that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Remember our trip to the Statue of Liberty? You climbed halfway up and wanted 
me to call you a cab. And what about our trip to Ireland to kiss the Blarney 
Stone? You took one look at all those steps and said, 'When you're married 30 
years, who needs to kiss another stone?' " 
</P>
<P>
He relented. I knew he would. I had him drop me off at the mall to buy a cute 
little stair-climbing outfit with matching headband. He parked a mile away, on 
purpose. He knows I hate curbs!

There is one thing that bothers me about concerts. Does it bother you? 
</P>
<P>
A group appears on stage to perform -- anything from a full symphony orchestra 
to an ensemble of six or seven. The men are dressed in tuxes. But the women are 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
What goes with men in black tuxes? Some years ago, the women usually wore long, 
black dresses. But apparently now women are allowed to choose their own garb as 
long as it meets the color preference. 
</P>
<P>
Some women come in sloppy black sweaters and tight black pants and sit with 
their legs wide apart -- and I am not talking about cello players. Sometimes 
the women look as if they are dressed for a jog in the park rather than an 
appearance on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The most disgusting sight recently was a woman whose stomach was so fat and 
whose pants were so tight that I couldn't concentrate on anything but hoping 
the seams would last until the evening was over. Maybe I sit too close to the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- The conventional facial expression assumed by satisfied 
concert-goers -- a sort of Silly Symphony serenity, in which the eyes gaze 
blankly upward and slightly to the right, while the mouth is fixed in a 
half-smile -- does not allow much fashion scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
But Miss Manners does not consider that to be an excuse for performers (or 
audience, for that matter) to dress sloppily. And indeed, when she peeked, she 
found your observations to be largely correct. 
</P>
<P>
A long black dinner dress or an equivalently dressy blouse and skirt 
combination form proper concert dress for female orchestra players. Unlike the 
dinner clothes (Miss Manners cannot bring herself to say "tux" or even 
"tuxedo") for male musicians, such a costume can be put together with some 
individuality and in any price range. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps gentlemen orchestra conductors are too timid to make such demands. If 
so, they would not be the first towering figures to quail at the prospect of 
dictating fashion to ladies. Miss Manners hopes at least that ladies who are 
conductors are not fooled by the plea that ladies' evening dress can be defined 
to mean anything the lady wishes to wear. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- How do you end a friendship with someone who refuses to 
take the hint? 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, I began a yearlong friendship (no dating) with a man with whom 
I had a few lunches and dinners and many long conversations. I became his dear 
friend -- in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
He was an odd hard-luck case whom I felt rather sorry for, and he began to make 
me very uncomfortable. So I began making excuses for not seeing him, wouldn't 
take his calls at the office, and ended the conversation quickly when he did 
reach me. 
</P>
<P>
That was six years ago, and he still calls. If I had dated him, I could say, 
"It's best we don't speak," but we never dated. Is it polite to say, "Don't 
call me anymore," and is there some excuse I can use to make it less painful 
for him? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners too would like to be gentle with a hard-luck case 
who fancies he has a friend in a lady who has refused to see him for six years. 
She suggests that this impulse be weighed against the nuisance value involved. 
</P>
<P>
How often does he call? If it is once or twice a year, Miss Manners suggests 
you allow him to continue in his illusion. If it is once a month, you might add 
to your usual refusal: "You know, I lead such a busy life that it's rather 
hopeless to expect that we will be able to get together. But I appreciate your 
thinking of me."

His attorneys argued that he should not be tried in a state court because 
federal law preempts state law in such cases. The Exxon Valdez ran aground on

SIERRA CLUB ASKS HALT TO SPRAYING OF MALATHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest escalation of public debate over Mediterranean fruit fly 
eradication methods, the California division of the Sierra Club petitioned 
state officials Monday to halt aerial application of malathion over Southern 
California neighborhoods so that more research can be done on the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club California, the state's largest environmental organization, with 14 
chapters and 150,000 members, stated that it has not taken a position on 
whether the pesticide is safe but only that enough questions have been raised 
to warrant a stop to spraying until there is conclusive proof. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give the agriculture industry a fair chance," said Joyce 
Coleman-Maginn, spokeswoman for the club. "But there is nothing we have been 
able to find out that says whether it is safe for aerial spraying. We just 
don't know enough." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new Medfly discovery could expand the spraying to Pomona, county 
agricultural officials said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
State and county agriculture officials, who have been battling the Medfly in 
Southern California since August, maintain not only that the spraying is safe, 
but that its continuation is crucial to the effort to rid California of a pest 
that could devastate the state's farm industry. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Monday, the Sierra Club called for new research on the 
short- and long-term effects of aerial spraying. In doing so, the influential 
organization lent its voice to what appears to be a growing movement of people 
opposed to aerial applications of pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"Until alternative methods are in place or the studies have been completed, we 
call on the California DFA (Department of Food and Agriculture) to declare a 
moratorium on aerial spraying of malathion over populated areas and to switch 
to alternative, safer and less intrusive methods," the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
The call for a moratorium came after a vote of the Sierra Club California's 
executive board on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Minyard, emergency program supervisor of the Department of Food and 
Agriculture, called the Sierra Club's demands unreasonable and potentially 
dangerous to agriculture. Minyard said previous studies have already shown 
malathion to be safe in the minute doses used in aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
He added that to delay spraying now would only guarantee that the current 
infestation would spread throughout the state's $5-billion fruit and nut 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"They're being extremely shortsighted," Minyard said. "If we stopped now, you 
would have the Medfly everywhere and there would be nothing you could do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hemb, the director of transportation and marketing services for the 
California Grape and Tree Fruit League, said the Sierra Club's opposition 
threatens to further erode public support for spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Any opposition is significant," he said. "This is a public relations battle at 
the current time. We're really worried right now; there's no question about it. 
With as much as we have on the line, we're nervous and getting more nervous 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
But Hemb and Minyard both said they believe that opponents to spraying are 
still in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, we've sprayed something like 750,000 residences," Minyard said. "We got 
about 1 1/2, 2 million people. How many have we heard from? A few thousand? 
It's a very small proportion." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's announcement came on the same day that the Los Angeles City 
Council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee began the first of two public 
hearings on aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, chairman of the committee, said he convened the meeting 
to hear from state officials, scientists and residents about whether aerial 
spraying is safe. About 175 spectators and witnesses attended. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he was disturbed that the state has proceeded with spraying without 
what he believes is conclusive scientific proof of the pesticide's safety. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of recertifying the 
use of malathion for agricultural and home use. The agency's review of the 
pesticide is expected to be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs asked state Department of Food and Agriculture Assistant Director Isi 
Siddiqui if the state would be willing to halt spraying until more conclusive 
studies were done. 
</P>
<P>
"The area involved is so big," Siddiqui said. "I'm not prepared to give you 
that hope." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina said she also was concerned about what she perceived 
as an attitude by the state of "thumbing its nose at us." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are entitled to know how long this is going to go on for and when 
are you going to give up," Molina said. "We need assurances from government 
that if the spraying has not eradicated the fly by mid-March or mid-April that 
they will stop." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said the committee will hold the second hearing in a few weeks and will 
make a recommendation for action to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
The current infestation covers 372 square miles in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties -- the largest in Southern California's history. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster filed suit seeking 
a court order to stop aerial spraying within their boundaries, but it was 
rejected by a Sacramento judge. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, immature male and female Medflies were captured over the weekend on 
the Cal Poly campus, prompting "a saturation of trapping" to get more 
information before deciding the next move, county agriculture commissioner's 
spokeswoman Anita Brown said Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, this would trigger a (spraying)," she said. "We're looking for 
evidence of a breeding population. But in light of the fact that there are so 
many eradication activities going on, we're trying to take a closer look. We 
expect to make a call, one way or the other, in the not-too-distant future."

2 L.A. OFFICERS, TARGET OF STING, STOLE MONEY, POLICE ALLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Two Los Angeles Police Department officers, targets of an undercover sting 
operation, were caught last week taking a small amount of cash from a police 
officer posing as a narcotics dealer, department sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol officers, who were suspected of stealing from people they have 
arrested, have been reassigned pending the results of an ongoing investigation 
by the Internal Affairs Division, according to police sources. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers, working on loan to the narcotics division of the Police 
Department's West Los Angeles Bureau, were members of a "chase team" called in 
to arrest a suspected drug dealer on Friday, sources said. But after arresting 
the "dealer" -- actually an undercover police officer -- the pair allegedly 
pocketed some of the money they had confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the amount of money taken was less than $100, but Cmdr. William 
Booth, who refused to name the officers or even talk about the details of the 
case, said any theft by a police officer is considered a serious breach. 
</P>
<P>
"If the investigation establishes a prima facie case of a crime being committed 
. . . then we will present it to the district attorney to consider filing 
criminal charges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the Police Department sting comes at a time when 18 suspended 
Los Angeles County sheriff's officers face a federal grand jury probe into 
allegations that they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from narcotics 
suspects during drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that investigation, federal investigators had searched the home of 
one LAPD narcotics officer, but no action has been taken against that officer 
by either the Police Department or by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials stress that this latest investigation is unrelated to the 
sheriff's scandal. "This was an opportunistic thing, a small-time deal," said 
one official. 
</P>
<P>
Booth told The Times that the investigation was actually launched after the 
department received a complaint several weeks ago from a man who contended that 
he was missing some property after his arrest. "That property was located under 
circumstances that cast suspicion on a couple of officers," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
In last Friday's sting, narcotics detectives pretended to arrange a drug buy 
with an undercover police officer posing as a narcotics dealer, sources said. 
Then, the narcotics team radioed the two patrol officers to chase down the 
"suspect" and arrest him. After making the arrest, the two officers allegedly 
took the money from the man, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a significant amount," said one narcotics officer familiar with the 
case. "It was like taking the pocket contents of a street dealer . . . but 
these guys went for the sting."

BRITTON ASKS YEAR-ROUND STATUS FOR ALL L.A. SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SCHOOL BOARD TO VOTE MONDAY ON CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-CROWDING PROPOSAL 
THAT WOULD AFFECT EACH PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT BY 1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will operate on a 
year-round basis by next year if the school board approves the overcrowding 
relief plan presented Monday by Supt. Leonard Britton. 
</P>
<P>
The plan reduces from three to two years the proposed timetable for converting 
the district to year-round, partially in response to parents' complaints that 
last month's staff proposal phased schools into such an operation too 
haphazardly, causing problems for families with children in different schools 
and outside programs that serve students. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, scheduled for a vote by the board next Monday, schools 
would operate on the so-called 90/30 calendar, which puts students in school 
for three months, followed by one-month vacations. It is similar to a 
traditional calendar, but provides a shorter summer vacation and a one-month 
spring break. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the plan, Britton left no doubt that the 612,000-student district 
-- the nation's second largest -- is moving toward multi-track, year-round 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that a year-round, multi-track system is eventually what 
all schools have to be engaged in," he told the board. "It is not a question of 
'if'." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, schools could choose either multi-track, which divides the student 
body into several groups and creates about 30% more space, because one group is 
on vacation at all times, or single track, with all students attending on the 
same schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Single track does not create more space, but would allow neighborhood services, 
such as child care and camps, to conform and make it easier to add tracks if 
enrollment grew. 
</P>
<P>
Single-track schools would have to add other options, such as larger classes or 
more portable classrooms, to increase capacity under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The district already has more than 100 year-round schools -- the vast majority 
of them operating multi-track to relieve overcrowding so severe that it must 
bus students to other less-crowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current proposal, 109 additional elementary schools would either go 
year-round or hold classes in double sessions beginning this summer. The rest 
of the district's schools -- including junior and senior highs -- would go 
year-round beginning in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The district is not likely to be able to air condition all the year-round 
schools -- a primary concern of many parents, especially in the San Fernando 
Valley where summer temperatures often exceed 100 degrees -- because state 
funds set aside to pay some of the approximately $1 million cost per school 
were recently diverted to other projects. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to delay discussion of the controversial proposal until it 
votes Monday. But the panel peppered Britton and staff with almost two hours of 
questions, demonstrating deep divisions among board members on how, and indeed 
whether, the district should take such a drastic step. 
</P>
<P>
The board came to the brink of converting the district to year-round schedules 
two years ago, then backed off in the face of parental opposition. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the district faces a literal shortfall of seats by next fall if 
enrollment continues to grow as it did this year -- by more than 15,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"Space is rapidly disappearing," Britton told the board Monday. "All schools 
must participate in the solution." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recommending year-round operation, Britton's report proposed 
other space-creating measures, including: 
</P>
<P>
* The reconfiguration of schools feeding into Gardena and Verdugo high schools 
so that elementary schools would provide kindergarten through fifth grade; 
junior highs would provide sixth through eighth grades, and high schools would 
include ninth through 12th, beginning next school year. 
</P>
<P>
* The reopening of Burton Elementary, one of 21 closed schools in the San 
Fernando Valley, as a receiver school for children from nearby overcrowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
To improve the educational environmental at current multi-track year-round 
schools, Britton also recommended that those schools slightly reduce their 
enrollment and that a pilot project be tried in three of the district's largest 
year-round schools -- those with more than 2,000 students each -- allowing each 
track to operate almost as a separate school.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 WHO SENT 'PAY-OR-DIE' LETTERS FOUND GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former aerospace technicians were convicted Monday of mailing extortion 
letters demanding millions of dollars from hundreds of prominent Antelope 
Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Faroni, 27, and Roman Makuch, 28, described during the trial as bright 
loners with a penchant for electronics, guns and cloak-and-dagger schemes, face 
up to eight years in prison for conspiracy, attempted extortion and mailing 
threatening letters. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set sentencing for Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict came 14 months after the mailing of at least 267 "pay-or-die" 
letters to professionals, business people and political leaders created a 
mystery strange enough to attract tabloid television programs, including 
"Unsolved Mysteries." The letters, which were strewn with profanity, threatened 
the lives of the recipients and their families, providing personal details that 
indicated the victims may have been watched.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAHONY BREAKS OFF TALKS WITH GRAVEDIGGERS 
UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that 97 gravediggers employed by the Los Angeles Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese have filed a petition stating that they "no longer want to be 
represented by the union," Archbishop Roger M. Mahony broke off negotiations 
Monday with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and said he 
would hold a new election. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara Mejia, Amalgamated's California manager, said the union will not 
agree to new balloting. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is another attempt on the archdiocese's part to avoid 
negotiations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Feb. 8, workers at the 10 archdiocese-run cemeteries voted 66 to 62 for 
union representation for one year, and an arbitration panel validated the 
election on Nov. 22 despite claims of worker harassment by the union. The 
archbishop contended Monday that the one-year union agreement expires next 
month, but Mejia said that the year starts from the panel's ruling in November.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY TO SEEK $233,000 FROM MOBIL IN 1988 
SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil will be asked to pay at least $233,000 more to cover costs that 
public agencies incurred to mop up oil spilled in Encino and Sherman Oaks after 
breaks in a Mobil pipeline in September, 1988, a Los Angeles deputy city 
attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
News of the bill surprised a Mobil attorney, prompting him to seek a hearing to 
review and possibly challenge the clean-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-review hearing, set March 6, was granted Monday by Los Angeles 
Municipal Court Judge Owen Kwong as the judge sentenced Mobil to pay fines and 
penalty assessments of $4,500 to settle the oil company's no contest plea to 
two misdemeanor counts of unlawfully allowing oil to be dumped into the Los 
Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fines, Kwong also ordered Mobil to pay the "emergency 
response costs" of public agencies that dealt with the company's oil spills of 
Sept. 10 and Sept. 27, 1988.

<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THE 49ERS CONSIDER THEIR PLACE IN HISTORY BEFORE TACKLING NEW 
GOAL OF THREE CONSECUTIVE SUPER BOWL TITLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers took a night to consider their place in history and 
were impressed enough Monday morning to stare a third consecutive Super Bowl 
title in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Amazing what a 45-point victory over the best team in the other conference does 
for your confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to do it again, that's fine with me," 49er Coach Seifert said at 
his post-Super Bowl news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Joe Montana stopped by the podium, picked up the keys to his new 
Buick -- that makes three cars and three most-valuable-player awards since 1981 
-- and said that his team's assault on the rest of the NFL did not end with 
Sunday's 55-10 rout of Denver in Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
Montana already likes his chances next year in Tampa, Fla., for Super Bowl XXV. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think they're pretty good at this point," he said. "It's a tough 
road. I think the toughest part of our schedule is getting out of our own 
division. I think that kind of prepares us for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert wasn't doing much to quiet the talk of his team winning a third 
consecutive championship. His players spoke openly during the past season about 
winning consecutive titles and weren't even tested, outscoring three playoff 
opponents by 100 points. Who is Seifert to judge? 
</P>
<P>
"There were times I walked the sideline and just shook my head in awe a little 
bit," Seifert said of his team's performance against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert's biggest challenge seems to be keeping the 49er powerhouse in order, 
which isn't easy in the days of Plan B free agency or as NFL general managers 
descend upon the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
But for a team that's been on top for so long, the 49ers are remarkably young. 
Montana is the oldest player at 33 and shows no signs of slowing down. He is 
signed through 1991 and is talking about playing beyond his contract -- great 
news for Montana fans, bad news for Montana opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Keena Turner is 31, safety Ronnie Lott 30. Most 49ers are still in 
their 20s. Like all other NFL teams, the 49ers must announce their list of 37 
protected players Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining players are eligible to negotiate freely around the league under 
the terms of Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about it," Seifert said. "It's something we'll be discussing 
in the next few days. We'll start our plans on the plane ride home." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the money doesn't get much better than in San Francisco, 
where owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. has never been afraid to send his team's ledger 
into the red for the sake of success. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, I don't look for a lot of change," Seifert said, "but I know 
that's the natural process." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, Seifert will lose his offensive coordinator, Mike Holmgren, 
to a vacant head coaching job with either the Phoenix Cardinals or the New York 
Jets. Holmgren is scheduled to meet with Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, clubs are very interested in Mike," Seifert said. "Just a year ago, 
I was going through the same thing. We have to see how the thing plays out." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the 49ers have always adjusted to the unavoidable curveballs thrown at a 
franchise. Seifert said the credit there goes to DeBartolo, who is always just 
a phone call away. 
</P>
<P>
When the 49ers lost linebackers Jim Fahnhorst and Riki Ellison to injuries this 
season, DeBartolo outbid the Rams for Matt Millen, who had been cut loose by 
the Raiders. When All-Pro nose tackle Michael Carter went down with a foot 
injury, the 49ers signed former New York Giant star Jim Burt, holding no 
grudges against the man who knocked Montana unconscious in a 1986 playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
That's the stuff of champions, and the 49ers -- winners of four Super Bowl 
titles -- can take a seat among the league's best teams. The comparisons with 
the great Pittsburgh teams of the 1970s are inevitable. The Steelers were the 
first team to win four Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, of course, grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh as a Steeler fan "long 
before they started to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I remember the (Steelers)," he said. "I saw the last (Super Bowl victory) 
in Pasadena. We're probably pretty close. Both were great defensive teams, with 
great running backs on both sides and similar types -- Roger (Craig) and Franco 
(Harris). And Tom (Rathman) and Rocky (Bleier). And the wide-outs. There are 
great ones on both sides. I think they match up pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
What about the matchup at quarterback, Montana vs. Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have my hair," Montana said, making the only comparison he was willing 
to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, was a Houston assistant in the 
1970s and faced the Steelers twice a season. 
</P>
<P>
His impressions after Sunday's game? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the Steelers were better because they had a better defense," 
Phillips said. "I'm not sure about that now." 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
The victory parade in San Francisco drew an estimated 75,000. . . . San 
Francisco Coach George Seifert, humble in victory, said he didn't mind sharing 
credit for this year's Super Bowl victory with former coach Bill Walsh, who 
retired after winning Super Bowl XXIII. "The mark Bill put on this club will 
last for a long time," Seifert said. "With the support of Eddie (DeBartolo), 
Bill kind of forged this thing. I'm satisfied being a part of it. As I've said 
a number of times, there's enough recognition to go around for all of us. I 
don't necessarily feel that this has to be my club. It's the 49ers' club and 
let it be at that." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Joe Montana, who underwent major surgery in 1986, said his back 
held up surprisingly well in 1989. "I had no problems the whole season," he 
said. "The doctors told me there'd be flare-ups in the season. I was real 
lucky." Montana also credited his offensive line with great protection. "I 
don't think I was touched in the playoffs, really," he said. "If things go this 
way, I could play for a long time." . . . Montana's efficiency rating in four 
Super Bowls is 127.8. His rating in the 49ers' three playoff victories this 
season was even better, 146.4. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rice needs one more receiving yard to tie Pittsburgh's Lynn Swann at the 
top of the Super Bowl list. Swann holds the record with 364 yards in four 
games.

MIKE DOWNEY: NBA BLEW CHANCE TO RAISE STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He died last week in Mozambique, Gabriel Estavo Mondjane did. He tripped and 
fell in his back yard, hitting his head on a concrete patio. 
</P>
<P>
During all the customary commotion of Super Bowl week, I did not get a day free 
to comment on Mondjane's death, which was hardly a proper way to see off a 
giant of our times. Now that football season is officially over and basketball 
season is back on my mind, however, I have been giving a great deal of thought 
to the big guy. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel was 8 feet 3/4 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your power forwards. There isn't a lineup in the NBA that couldn't 
have used Mondjane. He could have gone up to Manute Bol and called him 
"Shorty." He would have had to duck to dunk. 
</P>
<P>
This is one dude who wouldn't have needed a pump in his sneakers. Gabe could 
have won the opening tipoff barefoot. Teammates could have run give-and-go 
plays between his knees. He could have become the first player in history to 
bump his head on the overhead scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
He was 45 years old when he went, younger than Wilt, who still believes he can 
play, and not much older than Kareem, who was playing as recently as June. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, if only Jerry West or some other sharp NBA general manager had taken the 
time to go see the big fella in his hometown of Maputo. For the price of 
round-trip air fare to Mozambique, some team could have had the center of its 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson? Hah! That little squirt? Big Gabe had more than 12 inches on 
that puny San Antonio Spur. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing? Small potatoes. Put him at point guard. If the Knicks had 
bothered scouting Gabriel Mondjane, they could have been reading about him on 
the back page of the New York Post by now. He'd be the second-biggest center in 
town, after the World Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Manute Bol? Everybody makes such a fuss over him, merely because he's 7-feet-6, 
or 7-7, whatever. What's that compared to an authentic 8-footer? Mondjane could 
have guarded Bol with one hand and adjusted the 24-second clock with the other. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, I guess the big guy never did play basketball. According to his obituary, 
he weighed 392 pounds and used to work in a Portuguese circus. He was billed as 
"the Giant of Mondjacaze," after his birthplace in the province of Gaza. As 
nicknames go, it wasn't exactly "the Human Highlight Film" or "the Round Mound 
of Rebound," but pro basketball reporters would have come up with something 
better eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his death, the Guinness Book of Records confirmed him as the world's 
tallest man. The tallest man ever was one Robert Wadlow of Alton, Ill., who 
died in 1940. He stood 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I have spoken to several NBA general managers, all of whom agreed 
that, yes, they could probably use a good 8-11 man. 
</P>
<P>
I have to believe that if Gabriel Estavo Mondjane had been approached by 
somebody, he definitely could have been a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
Steadily over the last couple of decades, we have seen the growth of 
professional basketball, in more ways than one. When Chamberlain came along, he 
was colossal. Then came Abdul-Jabbar, who was even more so. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar led to Tom Burleson, who stood 7-4. Next in line was our old 
friend, Chuck Nevitt, who was 7-5. Then came Bol, tallest of them all. We 
ushered in an era in which 6-9 Magic Johnson was a playmaking guard and 7-4 
Ralph Sampson was somebody's forward. The word tall was redefined, right before 
our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
A census earlier this season revealed that the NBA had 40 players 7 feet or 
taller. There was talk of raising the hoop, widening the floor, raising the 
roof. Referees are getting bloody noses, merely trying to toss up the opening 
jump ball. Centers are going onto the disabled list with vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches, bawling out a player, start screaming: "Sit down while I talk to you!" 
</P>
<P>
"I am sitting," the player says. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he retires, an Abdul-Jabbar is a pipsqueak. At old arenas like 
Boston Garden or Chicago Stadium, nozzles of the locker-room showers are aimed 
at the players' kneecaps. Beds in hotels are so inadequate, players keep waking 
up with their feet in the minibar. 
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, who knows how big our basketball players will be? 
There's a baseball pitcher now, Randy Johnson of Seattle, who stands 6-10. 
Someday, he is going to go into his delivery and kick some batter in the chops. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad about Gabe Mondjane, who would have been the biggest thing in sports. 
</P>
<P>
People would have come for miles to see him dunk a free throw.

WITH MAGIC ILL, LAKERS ARE SHAKY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: GUARD IS BEDRIDDEN WITH FLU AS CLUB COMMITS 20 TURNOVERS AND 
LOSES TO SAN ANTONIO, 86-84. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Magic Johnson, bedridden because of flu, was not strong enough even to leave 
his Westside home Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a weakened condition themselves, the Lakers tried to beat the San 
Antonio Spurs without their best ballhandler, leading scorer and 
last-second-shot specialist. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be done, at least not this time. The Lakers, who committed 20 
turnovers, could not convert on two possessions in the last five seconds and 
lost to the Spurs, 86-84, before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Without Johnson, the Lakers might still be the Team of the 80s, as in 80 points 
on offense. It was the Lakers' second lowest output of the season. Credit the 
Spurs' defense and the cold-and-flu season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were out of sync without Earvin," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is vital. But the effort was great on both sides. They gave us a lot of 
chances to win it. We gave them one too many chances." 
</P>
<P>
Never was Johnson's absence felt more than in the final 20 seconds of this 
sloppily played game between Western Conference powers. Given a chance to 
maintain their home-court dominance even in Johnson's absence, the Lakers 
(31-10) could not make the crucial baskets, despite James Worthy's 32-point 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it was only the Lakers' second loss in 21 home games. 
</P>
<P>
After the Spurs' Terry Cummings missed a jump shot that could have broken the 
84-84 tie, the Lakers had the ball with about 15 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Drew, Johnson's replacement at point guard, broke free on a fast break. 
But his layup was blocked from behind by Willie Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Anderson) got a little piece of the ball and a little piece of me," 
Drew said. 
</P>
<P>
"No call was made, so you got to live with it. There was no second-guessing." 
</P>
<P>
No, that would come a possession or two later. 
</P>
<P>
After Anderson's block, the Spurs launched their own fast break, Anderson 
drawing a foul by Orlando Woolridge with 5.9 seconds to play. Anderson made 
only one of the two free throws, giving the Lakers the ball with five seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
It is in such situations that Johnson's steadying influence is needed most. But 
Riley could not diagram a play running through Johnson's bedroom, so the Lakers 
tried to get the ball to either Worthy or Byron Scott. 
</P>
<P>
With Michael Cooper inbounding, Scott circled the key and ran toward Cooper. 
The pass deflected off Scott's hands and into the Spurs' possession. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I threw it too hard," said Cooper, fighting flu himself. 
</P>
<P>
"After the fact, I guess I should've called time out again. I usually throw 
that pass to Magic, and he can handle it. But I threw it too hard to Byron." 
</P>
<P>
Again, Anderson was fouled, this time with 1.1 seconds left. And again, 
Anderson missed one of two free throws for an 86-84 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With another chance to win or tie, the Lakers ran basically the same half-court 
play. But this time, Cooper found Worthy open slightly outside the three-point 
line. It is unclear whether Worthy was behind the line when he released the 
shot, but his turnaround jumper bounced off the back of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio, one of three teams chasing the Lakers in the Western Conference, 
had survived the scare and won at the Forum for the first time since January of 
1984, ending a 14-game losing streak at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Not that either team would consider Monday's game a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs made only 37.2% of their shots and had 15 turnovers. David Robinson, 
who made only six of 17 shots, finished with 19 points and 16 rebounds. 
Cummings had 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, such cold shooting might have led to a third consecutive road loss 
for San Antonio (28-13). But, without Johnson directing the Laker offense, this 
was not an ordinary game. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic does a great job organizing things, getting the ball down court and 
initiating the break," Woolridge said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's not in there, our offense struggles. Sometimes, in that situation, 
people get self-willed and try to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Drew might have been one of those players. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming into that situation, I know the guys aren't as comfortable with the 
(offensive) flow as they are if Magic's there. Collectively, we kind of had to 
play through that." 
</P>
<P>
With or without Johnson, the Lakers will try to get back in sync tonight 
against the Clippers at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Will Johnson play? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Riley said. "He's real sick. We learned something from tonight. 
Whether he's there or not, we have a tough game and have to play well." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's game was the first regular-season game Magic Johnson has missed 
since last Feb. 20, when he missed five games because of a torn left hamstring. 
The Lakers, in his absence, were 3-2 in those games. This season, Johnson 
played only the first three minutes of the Lakers' home opener before he and 
Phoenix guard Kevin Johnson were ejected because of a shoving incident. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Byron Scott said his bruised left knee, which caused him to sit out most 
of Sunday's practice after a collision with center Mark McNamara, has vastly 
improved. "I'm all right, but I put I dent in Mark's leg," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Buck Coach Del Harris, who harshly criticized the inexperienced 
officiating crew after Friday night's loss to the Lakers, told a Milwaukee 
Journal reporter that he plans to contact Laker Coach Pat Riley and apologize. 
Harris said he did not mean to detract from the Lakers' victory by blaming it 
on the referees. Rod Thorn, vice president of operations for the NBA, said he 
is reviewing Harris' comments.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY AT GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With one-tenth of a second to play at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 15, the New 
York Knicks' Trent Tucker took an inbounds pass and made a three-point shot 
that beat the Chicago Bulls, 109-106. The Bulls protested the game, claiming 
the clock was started late. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Bulls' protest be upheld? Said Rod Thorn, NBA vice president of 
operations: "I recognize it's impossible to catch a ball with two hands and 
shoot it in one-tenth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody had thrown a lob pass toward the basket and a player had tipped it 
in, that's a horse of a different color. But in this case, the referee should 
have taken the bull by the horns and waved off the basket." It is assumed no 
pun was intended. 
</P>
<P>
Add Bulls: Michael Turner, a University of Chicago astrophysicist, said of the 
controversy: "A lot of things can happen in one-tenth of a second. A star 
explodes every tenth of a second in the universe, and light travels at 186,000 
miles per second and can circumnavigate the globe. The only thing I can't think 
of is a three-point shot with that much time on the clock, unless, of course, 
you're playing in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Bulls: The Bulls' Michael Jordan blames the Detroit Pistons' Isiah 
Thomas, president of the NBA players' union, for vetoing the proposed 
$1-million one-on-one showdown between Jordan and the Lakers' Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jordan: "I wonder what Isiah's position would be if he were playing Magic. 
But, of course, if he were playing Magic, no one would want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 30, 1971, who scored 28 points to lead UCLA to a 74-61 
victory over UC Santa Barbara, starting the Bruins' record 88-game winning 
streak? 
</P>
<P>
Designing woman: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner attended a news conference 
in Indianapolis last week to introduce the uniforms she designed for the 
Indiana Pacers. The uniforms are navy blue, yellow and white. Griffith Joyner 
favored a Laker look -- a purple dress and gold shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins update: Texas El Paso basketball Coach Don (the Bear) Haskins says he 
probably will not return to the bench this season because of a severe case of 
laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins said his voice has improved recently, but he is fearful of returning 
courtside because he tends to yell during games. Assistant Coach Norm 
Ellenberger has guided the Miners in Haskins' absence. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins said he watched the Miners lose a road game on television recently. Did 
he get excited? 
</P>
<P>
"I even screamed at the TV set," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oski update: Oski, the University of California mascot who was suspended by the 
school after he tossed a two-layer cream cake onto the laps of visiting Oregon 
State fans on Jan. 7, has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Rittler Andrews, spirit coordinator at Cal, said Oski "apologized and 
knew he was wrong. He was very upset with the whole situation. (He) wasn't 
using common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Grass is greener: How popular is soccer outside the United States? A West 
German merchandising company recently reached an agreement with Italia '90 
organizers to sell the turf from Rome's Olympic Stadium after the World Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Curtis Rowe.

Quotebook: The Kings' Luc Robitaille, on the possibility of playing with the 
Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux: "A fire hydrant could score 40 goals 
playing on Lemieux's line. He is amazing the way he moves the puck. I'd be 
all-world on his line." GARR KLUENDER

49ERS TURNING NFL'S ATTEMPTS FOR PARITY INTO A PRIVATE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two most remarkable things about the champion San Francisco 49ers are their 
dominance in a parity era and their extraordinary improvement in just the past 
year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Parity is a condition that the NFL strives for with the inverse draft and other 
policies designed to cripple winners. And it works. Of the league's 28 teams, 
17 are evenly matched, and 10 others are only a bit better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers alone stick out. 
</P>
<P>
They are the dominant team that American sports fans have yearned for since 
learning to love the old New York Yankees and Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
But they weren't that good a year and a half ago. After 11 games in 1988, the 
49ers were the shining symbol of NFL parity. They stood 6-5 that day. They had 
just lost a 9-3 game to the Raiders, who were to finish 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, and strangely, the 49ers started winning a week later, and they're 
still at it, having won 24 of their past 27 games, including two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
If they are the best of all time, how could the 49ers so recently have stood 
6-5 with the same personnel that clobbered Denver, 55-10, in Super Bowl XXIV? 
</P>
<P>
Even against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII, quarterback Joe 
Montana had to bring them from behind to win in the final seconds, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are a unique but mysterious success story. 
</P>
<P>
After succeeding Bill Walsh as the 12th leader of the 49ers this season, George 
Seifert instantly found that he inherited a team highly motivated by Walsh's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he had a cast of players handpicked by Walsh, who ranks as one of the 
most shrewd talent scouts of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
This season, accordingly, it couldn't have been too hard to coach the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
As Seifert said Monday: "Bill sort of forged this team. I'm satisfied just to 
be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Next season's team, however, will belong more to Seifert. Of the 55 49ers now 
under contract, he can protect only 37 under Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
He will also have to come up with a new way to motivate the players. In 
football, wanting to win is seldom motive enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you've got to fear something," Montana said last week. 
</P>
<P>
And this season, the 49ers feared that they might lose without Walsh. 
Specifically, they feared what people would say about them as football players 
if they lost without Walsh, who showed them how to win three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert's task will be at least twice as difficult next season. But he'll have 
these two advantages over most other coaches: 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Montana to Jerry Rice to Roger Craig to John Taylor to Tom Rathman to 
Brent Jones, the 49er offense is so talented that it will be less dependent on 
a motivational crutch than most of its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The club's two work-ethic models, Craig and Ronnie Lott, are so diligent 
that they inspire the whole organization. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine and newspaper reporters who ignored Montana this winter in their 
player-of-the-decade rankings should be required to stand in a corner until 
they understand what the 49er quarterback accomplished in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
A man who directs a pro football team through four Super Bowl-winning seasons 
in nine years should win North American player of the decade by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated, which chose hockey's Wayne Gretzky, overlooked two things 
about U.S. sports: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In nationwide interest, football is far ahead of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It requires more talent and courage to play quarterback well than to 
succeed in any position in any other major team sport. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, for instance, it takes talent to pitch effectively -- but there 
are no blitzers bearing down on the pitcher as he waits for a teammate to find 
a clearing in the maze of a zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, pro players are doubtless better athletes, on the average, than 
football, hockey or baseball players, but the full repertoire of an NBA player 
is incomparably simpler than Montana's. 
</P>
<P>
In hockey, Gretzky can fight back. In football, Montana has to stand there and 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the Philadelphia Eagles sacked and bloodied Montana eight 
times, but he got up to win, coming back with four touchdown passes in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether there's a better athlete in any sport than Montana. 
Although Bronco quarterback John Elway is a spectacular athlete, Montana has 
better physical coordination, better balance and better agility. In physical 
resources, Montana is arguably the better man. 
</P>
<P>
Montana as an athlete is like a deer out there, or a dancer, or a leaf in the 
wind -- graceful, fluid, effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is grand -- no arguments there -- but the leader of four Super Bowl 
champions is the player of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
What the Denver defense discovered Sunday is that there's no way to defend 
against the four-time champions. 
</P>
<P>
On their first touchdown drive of the second quarter, the 49ers, after opening 
a 13-3 lead with passes, rested their wide receivers and gave the ball to 
running backs Craig and Rathman on 13 of the 14 plays. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two minutes of the first half, Montana, who had been clobbering 
Denver with short passes, needed a big play to beat the clock, so he launched 
one to Rice for a 38-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
When the Broncos rushed Montana with three defensive linemen, he could and did 
wait a tick, then picked out the open target. 
</P>
<P>
When they rushed him with three linemen and a linebacker, he hastily fired over 
the middle, usually to Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers can play every kind of football. Although Rice, for example, is known 
for his brilliance as a receiver, he showed the toughness to fight off one of 
Denver's toughest hitters, safety Steve Atwater, when Atwater tried to knock 
him down on the five-yard line on a touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have gone for the sure tackle," Atwater said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most true to form of the 24 Super Bowl games -- the blowout that 
most coaches and scouts expected -- but for the sports fans who appreciate 
beauty and greatness in a football team, it was worth watching all the way. 
With Walsh gone from the NFL, it may be years before there is another team that 
can play on this level.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FULLERTON HAS 10-POINT LEAD WITH 2:21 LEFT, THEN SANTA 
BARBARA RALLIES TO WIN IN OVERTIME, 72-64.

Cedric Ceballos had played one of the finest games of his career Monday night, 
and Cal State Fullerton had a 10-point lead over UC Santa Barbara with 2:21 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't safe in the Thunderdome, as the Gauchos prefer their Campus 
Events Center be known. 
</P>
<P>
Eric McArthur, Carrick DeHart and Idris Jones saw to that, helping Santa 
Barbara storm back to force an overtime and send Fullerton to a 72-64 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos finished with 33 points, but only one basket in the final seven 
minutes of regulation and five minutes of overtime. His last chance to save a 
Fullerton victory in regulation came with seven seconds left, when he drove the 
lane and was fouled by DeHart. But he missed the front end of a one-and-one, 
just as teammate Wayne Williams had twice before him in the final two minutes, 
leaving the score tied, 62-62, at the end of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara came back with strong rebounding and big plays by Jones, who hit 
two three-point baskets in the final 2:13, and McArthur, who added a 
three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Santa Barbara jumped ahead by four points and Fullerton failed to 
get any closer. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos did away with a 31-31 halftime tie by scoring 11 of Fullerton's points 
in a 13-4 run to start the second half that staked Fullerton to a 44-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, who became the Gauchos' all-time leading scorer last week when he 
surpassed Doug Rex's 1,434 points, quickly added to his 1,457 career total in 
the first half. He scored 18 points in the first half, including four of five 
shots from three-point range. He finished with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Without him and McArthur, Santa Barbara might have been in trouble. The Gauchos 
went ahead by seven points early in the game, 24-17, after 11 consecutive 
points by DeHart. But then Fullerton ran off 14 points in a row to take a 31-24 
lead. McArthur, who finished with 28 points and 21 rebounds, scored to break 
the run and then DeHart added a three-point basket to help the Gauchos battle 
back and tie the score at halftime.

Les Jepsen scored 18 points, including the winning layup with two seconds to 
play, as Iowa defeated No. 11 Illinois, 69-67, Monday night at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>

24 games at Iowa City, fell to 15-4 and 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Liberty scored eight consecutive points as the Illini opened a 56-52 
edge with 7:45 left. James Moses' basket brought Iowa within 58-56, but a

67-64 with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Lookingbill made a three-point shot that tied the game with 35 seconds to 
go. Illinois missed three shots before Iowa grabbed a loose ball and called 
timeout to set up the winning play. Lookingbill sealed the victory by 
intercepting an inbounds pass with 1.5 seconds left.

COLLEGE DIVISION: UC RIVERSIDE HAS TALENT BUT NEEDS TO AVOID INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UC Riverside baseball team started last season as one of the favorites to 
win the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
A series of injuries, which resulted in nine players missing 10 or more games, 
squelched the title hopes of the Highlanders, who finished with a 24-26-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
If the Highlanders stay injury-free, they may make up for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside is led by outfielders Scott Einhorn and Pete Weber and infielders 
Matt Davis, Logan Ostrander and Ty Murphy, who batted .338. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers Bill Jordan and Doug Pierce also return. 
</P>
<P>
It may be too much to ask Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to repeat its remarkable 
success of last season, when the Mustangs won their first NCAA Division II 
national championship and finished with a 38-25 record. But with five top 
offensive players returning, the Mustangs are still among the CCAA contenders. 
Leading the way are All-Division II West Region selections Doug Noce at catcher 
and Pat Kirby at first base. Another top hitter is third baseman Matt Drake. 
</P>
<P>
In its final year in the CCAA and Division II before moving up to Division I 
next season, Cal State Northridge appears ready for one last bid at a 
conference title. The Matadors, who were 30-19-1 last year and barely missed a 
playoff berth, are led by sophomores Mike Solar at shortstop, Greg Shockney in 
center field and Denny Vigo at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's pitching staff revolves around Craig Clayton and Scott Sharts, a 
transfer from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
There will be several new faces in the starting lineup for Cal Poly Pomona, 
which finished with a 24-28 record last season, but Coach John Scolinos is 
returning for his 42nd season. The Broncos, second in the CCAA last season, 
will build around the pitching of seniors Wayne Koklys and Bret Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
With a surplus of newcomers on his team's roster, Coach Mike Weathers is hoping 
Chapman will bear little resemblance to the team that finished 24-28 last 
season. A key will be the development of catcher Mike Kelly, first baseman Doug 
Yates and shortstop Mark Landeros -- all junior college transfers. The top 
returning players are infielders Chris Cutliff and Tom Allison, pitcher Pete 
Coleman and outfielder Jody Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills expects improvement from a 16-29-1 season. The Toros 
are led by outfielders Robert Campbell and Marty Williams, and have good 
pitching prospects in newcomers Vincent Aguilar and Armando Placencia. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles, after posting a 23-31-1 mark last season, should be 
competitive in a difficult conference. The Golden Eagles have solid pitchers in 
Abdom Pinon and Steve McGovern, plus shortstop Brent Bish and catcher Marty 
Tourville. 
</P>
<P>
After a 20-year wait and consecutive second-place finishes, Westmont finally 
won an NAIA District 3 title last season. It does not figure to take the 
Warriors as long to win their next championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who finished 34-16 and won 26 of their last 30 games in 1989, are 
led by first baseman Tim Viohl and shortstop Tim Kimmel. Viohl had nine home 
runs and 48 runs batted in, and Kimmel had a .335 batting average in his fourth 
year as a starter. Pitcher Rich Ebarb was 4-1 with a 3.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, which finished second to Westmont last year at 30-20, has first 
baseman Carlos Salazar, outfielder Tim Norman and second baseman Tim Williams. 
Salazar had 12 homers and 50 RBI last season. The pitching staff is topped by 
Fred Whatley and Jose Gallardo. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran finished 31-18 last season -- best record in the school's history. 
The Kingsmen have five starting pitchers returning, including Mike Clark and 
Kevin O'Neill. The lineup includes all-district infielder Jeff Brouelette and 
outfielder Darnell Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most improved team in the district is Cal Baptist, which returns 
all of its starters from a team that was 25-25 last season. The Lancers should 
have an explosive offense, led by NAIA All-American outfielder Tim Lopez, who 
batted .368 with 15 homers and 67 RBI last season, and all-district players 
Darin Burton at third base and DH Greg Chizek. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College, 30-21 last year, is led by pitcher Jim Dedrick and 
has an outstanding transfer in Ralph Garcia. The Vanguards also return two 
all-district players -- third baseman Alex Andrade and catcher Denny Berni, a 
.400 hitter last season. 
</P>
<P>
Biola has one of the top pitchers in the Southland, Tim Worrell, whose brother 
plays for the St. Louis Cardinals. Worrell was 9-5 with a 3.48 ERA last season 
and had 110 strikeouts in 93 innings. The Eagles, 20-27-1 last season, will 
also rely on Brett Carter to form a solid one-two pitching combination. Leading 
the attack are first baseman Bob Keller and shortstop Fred Speck, who batted 
.371 last season. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs of improvement for The Master's, which suffered through a 15-32 
season. The Mustangs have good offensive personnel, including shortstop Mark 
MacArthur, first baseman Jeff Preston and third baseman Russ Henzie. Pitching 
is a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne appears to be stronger than last season, when the Leopards won the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title and finished 
20-20 overall. La Verne has reliable starters in Matt Solters and Paul Janssen 
and catcher Ben Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps was 24-14 last season -- best overall mark in the SCIAC 
-- and should produce plenty of offense with the return of shortstop Paul 
Urrutia, center fielder Marc Sherman, first baseman Andy Sallee and catcher 
Greg Ratkovic. The Stags have a solid pitcher back in Pete Young. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands finished third in the SCIAC at 12-6, and 19-18 overall. The Bulldogs 
are solid offensively with first baseman Rick Bennett, center fielder Scott 
Begg and infielders Jeff Sofro and Bobby Windver. The pitching includes Wade 
Rockwood and Keith Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, 22-17 in '89, is led by brothers Tom and Mike Bonetto in the 
infield -- both All-SCIAC selections last year -- and shortstop Mark Harris and 
catcher Mike Kniseley. All-conference pitcher Dave Stoll was 8-3 with a 3.39 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier has 11 freshmen, including shortstop Louis Benbow, pitcher David 
Berliner and outfielder Cody Nelson. Returning for the Poets, 10-27-2 last 
season, are catcher Todd Fujimori, outfielder Alika Kauleinamoku and pitcher 
Scott Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Pitzer will be searching for respectability in its first year under Jim 
Barker after finishing 11-23 overall last season. The Sagehens have outfielder 
Gregg Silver, second baseman Steve Fenton and All-SCIAC pitcher Chris Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino, an NCAA Division III independent, was 28-8-1 last 
season. Pitchers returning are Joe Glasscock and Darren Kay, 7-2 with a 3.46 
ERA last year. Paul Gonzalez batted .336.

THE PREPS: SOME COACHES STILL SUPPORTING THE NO-FAIL RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Los Angeles Unified School District decided to drop its no-fail 
requirement for extracurricular activities last week, most City coaches were 
pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Many opposed the rule when it was introduced in 1982, claiming that it was 
unfair to make a student who maintained a 2.0 grade-point average, but failed 
one course, ineligible for athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, this view has gained support as many teams lost key players as a 
result of the City's 10-week grade reports. In November, Fairfax's football 
team had to forfeit its opening-round playoff game against El Camino Real of 
Woodland Hills because of too many ineligible players, and there was even talk 
of coaches boycotting the playoffs because of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
However, Randolph Simpson, boys' basketball coach at Manual Arts, said the 
recent decision is more of a setback than a move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"What this decision does is say to the kids that it is OK for them to fail a 
class and to slack off," said Simpson, whose Toilers are the top-ranked team in 
the City this season. "Everyone should be pushing harder with an attitude that 
they have to get it done because it is not going to be that way for them when 
they move into the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"This move may help a lot of athletic teams but it is condoning failure. I 
truly believe that athletes need to deserve to play. They need to strive to be 
the best on the court and in the classroom because if they don't make it in 
sports, they will need to turn to academics." 
</P>
<P>
At Manual Arts, there are special study halls and tutoring programs for 
athletes to assist in their academic careers. The school also has its own grade 
checks every two weeks. This practice has been effective with the Toiler boys' 
basketball program, which has not lost a player to academic ineligibility in 
the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the board has made its decision to get rid of the rule, we will 
continue among ourselves to have tough academic policies," Simpson said. "The 
kids need to put in the extra work in order to be successful; they have to do 
this just to have a chance in college. By changing this rule we are teaching 
them the wrong thing . . . that academics is not foremost." 
</P>
<P>
Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in a long time, the City finally took a step in the right 
direction by eliminating that rule," said Vollnogle, who has been against the 
no-fail rule since its origin. 
</P>
<P>
"Students can now take a difficult class that they were not sure they'd pass. 
So, a player can take that higher math course without being worried about 
flunking out. It also gives us coaches a chance to work and counsel students we 
would normally not have a chance with because they are now eligible." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the no-fail rule said student-athletes are not graded fairly in 
the midsemester grade reports, claiming it is a common practice for teachers to 
give a student a lower grade in an effort to prevent the student from slacking 
off later in the semester. 
</P>
<P>
"This rule change will also help teachers because sometimes they are pressured 
not to fail a kid to keep him eligible," Vollnogle said. "And it also will help 
those teachers who always give kids lower grades at report time to motivate 
them. Consequently, I just did not see anything good out of that rule." 
</P>
<P>
Added Simpson: 
</P>
<P>
"We are not teaching the kids reality. Allowing a kid to fail is not what it's 
going to be like when they move out into society. What is lost is the fact that 
it takes a real lack of effort to fail a class, and if a kid is still failing 
while putting in the effort, he needs to get extra work and attention." 
</P>
<P>
After searching for a qualified coach for two months without success, Reseda 
Cleveland canceled its track and field season, forcing athletes interested in 
competing to seek eligibility at another school. 
</P>
<P>
The program was canceled when a replacement for Steve Landress, who last season 
was the third track coach in as many years, could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Kindseth, Cleveland's administrator in charge of athletics, 
for a Cleveland student to compete at another school: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Permission is needed from both principals and the coach at the second 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The athlete would have to enroll in a sixth-period physical-education 
course at the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The athlete would have to provide the necessary transportation between 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia scored 60 points in La Quinta High's 85-32 victory over Kennedy 
Monday to establish an Orange County girls' single-game scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia broke the record of 59 set Cincy Vyskocil during the 1986-87 season.

Indian officials said that weightlifter Subrata kumar Paul, winner of two 
silver medals and one bronze medal in the 67.5-kilogram category at the 
Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, was on his way home to Calcutta 
after being caught in random testing for use of an anabolic steroid. 
</P>
<P>
A second athlete who tested positive was not identified pending a second test. 
</P>
<P>
Later in Auckland, Australia's Glen Housman won the 1,500-meter freestyle swim 
in 14:55.25, short of the world record of 14:54.76 set by the Soviet Union's 
Vladimir Salnikov in 1983.

NEWSWIRE: FANS' JEERING PLAGUED MOORE, HIS WIDOW SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tonya Moore, widow of former Angel pitcher Donnie Moore, blames fans who 
continually jeered her husband for contributing to the frustration that 
eventually induced him to shoot her and kill himself, according to an article 
in the February issue of GQ. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore is also quoted as saying her husband beat her "to a pulp" when she 
was 19 and struck her again the night he gave up a two-out, two-strike home run 
to Dave Henderson, which allowed the Boston Red Sox to overcome a ninth-inning 
Angel lead and eventually win the game and the 1986 American League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had 31 saves in 1985 -- still a club record -- Moore was booed by 
Angel fans after giving up Henderson's home run and was never able to match his 
previous success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forgive the fans for what they did to my husband. Never, ever," the 
magazine quotes Tonya Moore as saying. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from bullet wounds to her neck and chest after the incident in 
the couple's Anaheim Hills home July 18, 1989, Tonya Moore spent two months in 
a mental hospital. She told GQ that her two sons still require therapy. HELENE

L.A. GEAR STOCK TUMBLES 10% AS INCOME LEAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sneaker maker L.A. Gear bounded to new financial heights Monday, but it didn't 
leap high enough to please Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing Marina del Rey company, the nation's No. 3 sneaker firm, said 
its earnings climbed 86% to $11.6 million on sales that soared 160% to $166.35 
million in its fourth quarter ended Nov. 30. For the year, L.A. Gear's profit 
was up 150% to $55.06 million on sales that rose 176% to $617.08 million. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear's stock, however, fell $2.75, or 10%, to $24.625 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Analysts said the company's sales exceeded their expectations 
but that its earnings were mildly disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market "is very unforgiving at this point, and sneaker companies tend 
to be very volatile issues," said Todd M. Berko, an analyst with Drexel Burnham 
Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Nike, the nation's top sneaker firm, were off $1.50 to close at $52 
on Monday while shares of Reebok, the No. 2 firm, fell 37.5 cents to finish at 
$15.625. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear's stock, the biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange last year, 
has slid since mid-November, when it hovered in the mid-$40s. L.A. Gear has 
been dogged by speculation that its several years of dramatic growth are coming 
to end, and the new earnings report apparently aroused those concerns anew. 
</P>
<P>
"The market's forecasting that they can't keep up this pace for ever, that 
they're going to stumble," said Ted O'Glove, publisher of the Quality of 
Earnings Report newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Gil N. Schwartzberg, the company's chief administrative officer, said increased 
advertising expenses moderated the company's earnings increase in the fourth 
quarter. He said that L.A. Gear, which last year signed pop singer Michael 
Jackson as a commercial spokesman, aired its first network television 
commercials as well as its first commercials aimed at men during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzberg said the company, which is aiming for revenue of $1 billion this 
year, expects the ad campaign to translate into significant gains in sales of 
men's sneakers. The company traditionally has sold its trendy footwear and 
other apparel products mainly to teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear also said that its sales in January and February were more than 
double the level of a year earlier. That performance, however, wasn't good 
enough for some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"The question was whether they (sales) were going to triple or not," said John 
Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, L.A. Gear is shortly expected to name a new chief financial 
officer. The new executive would fill the opening created early last month with 
the resignation of Elliot J. Horowitz, who quit after rejecting a contract 
offer that would have cut his seven-figure salary. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz's departure, along with recent news of a government investigation into 
alleged underpayment of customs duties by the company, contributed to concerns 
raised about the firm.

Bank of New England to Sell Credit Card Business: Bank of New England Corp., 
strapped for cash because of financial losses, said it would sell its credit 
card business to Citicorp for $828 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston-based bank announced earlier this month that it was trying to sell 
$6 billion worth of assets. The bank has said it expects a loss of more than $1 
billion in 1989 because of bad real estate loans. The bank said it expected to 
make a profit of about $176 million from the sale of the credit card business.

Consumer spending rose 7.3% in 1989, its fastest pace in three years, while 
personal income jumped 9%, the largest increase in five years, the government 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said spending totaled $3.58 trillion last year, posting 
the largest gain since a 6.1% advance in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health because it 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The department 
reported last Friday that spending posted a rare decline of 0.1% during the 
entire fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Income totaled $4.43 trillion last year; its 9% rise marked the sharpest jump 
since a 9.5% increase in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, rose to 
5.5% from a 4.2% rate in 1988. It was the highest rate since the 6.1% posted in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, spending rose 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$3.58 trillion in December, the smallest increase since a 1% advance last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Income, however, edged up just 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$4.57 trillion, the smallest increase since a 0.2% gain last September. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually cold weather contributed to the December jump in spending. 
Expenditures for fuel oil, electricity and natural gas increased $15.1 billion 
following a 3.1% increase in November. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than three 
years -- rose $6.7 billion after declining $2.8 billion the previous month. 
Non-durable purchases gained $6.2 billion after a $3.4-billion November 
increase. Spending on services increased $24.1 billion following a $9.6-billion 
advance the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
The December report showed that Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, after 
a 1% gain in November.

VINYL ALBUM ON LAST SPIN AS CDS, CASSETTES MOVE AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time a fancy turntable called the Finial LT-1 was introduced at the 
Consumer Electronics Show this month after eight years and $10 million in 
research and development, the vast consumer market for which it was originally 
intended had all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The Finial LT-1, which offers a significant technical advance because it uses 
laser beams instead of a diamond stylus to track the grooves on a vinyl record, 
was done in by machines whose technology it attempted to mimic: compact-disc 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly the vision of the (inventors) that the economies of scale 
would enable this product to eventually reach a broader audience," said Jacques 
Robinson, president of Carillon Technology Inc., a Sunnyvale-based firm that 
makes the LT-1. But because album sales fell by two-thirds in the eight years 
that it took to bring the turntable to market, Robinson says the LT-1, with a 
list price of $32,000, "now has a more limited future." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Finial LT-1 to reach a mass audience is the latest evidence 
that the longtime champion of the record business, the vinyl album, is on its 
final leg -- about to go the way of the 10-cent local phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of CDs in 1983, nationwide sales of vinyl albums have 
declined to $532 million in 1988 from $1.5 billion in 1983, according to the 
Recording Industry Assn. of America, a Washington-based industry trade group. 
Compact discs and cassette tapes now account for more than 90% of the record 
industry's $6.2 billion in prerecorded music sales, according to a study 
released this month by Street Pulse Group, a New Milford, Conn.-based market 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl's disappearance raises the issue of how the speed of technological 
innovation can overtake the industry's ability to devise compensation 
agreements for its creative segment -- the performers, writers and producers of 
music. Artists worry that when a new format eclipses an existing one, they 
could be left with a dwindling source of revenue from the old technology and no 
way to profit from the new. 
</P>
<P>
Their concern recalls the earlier efforts by Hollywood directors, writers and 
craft unions to negotiate contracts granting them a share of the burgeoning 
home videotape market in addition to what they received from their work on the 
silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
In negotiations under way this week in New York, the American Federation of 
Musicians is seeking to increase the compensation that an estimated 4,000 
musicians receive from a Special Payments Fund financed by a royalty levied on 
the sale of each record, CD and prerecorded cassette tape. 
</P>
<P>
The fund has been shrinking over the last few years because the royalty fee was 
lowered several years ago and also because sales of LPs, which have the highest 
royalty rate, have slumped. The current royalty rate is 0.45% of the list price 
of a CD or tape and 0.52% of the list price of an LP, according to Edward 
Peters, manager of the federation's Special Payments Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants royalty rates raised across the board. It also wants musicians 
to receive an additional premium for each format they appear in, said record 
industry negotiator Norman Samnick of the New York law firm Strook &amp; Strook 
&amp; Lavan. Union negotiators would not comment on their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of money is at stake here," said J. Martin Emerson, who is president of 
the Federation. "There's no doubt that (musicians') income from the sale of 
records has sunk in the last 10 years. We want to address that." 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who is an employee of the U.S. Department of Labor -- which administers 
the union fund -- and not a party to the negotiations, said the Special 
Payments Fund for musicians averaged $16 million to $24 million after expenses 
during the 1970s. But it currently hovers around $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unit sales of most formats of recorded music are down from their 1978 peaks, 
but vinyl has been especially hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, officials of Chrysalis Records confirmed that they have ceased 
releasing most records on 12-inch vinyl. Although many major record companies 
have phased out vinyl country and classical records, Chrysalis is believed to 
be the first major label to publicly acknowledge that it no longer issues vinyl 
pop music albums. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last two releases have not been on vinyl," company spokesman Elaine 
Summers said. "The demand has gotten so small for albums, (we) save money by 
not pressing them." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure by Chrysalis, which records major pop artists such as Billy Idol 
and Pat Benatar, came only a year after most Music Plus stores in Southern 
California stopped carrying vinyl albums to devote more space to tapes and 
compact discs. After the move by Music Plus, other major record stores have 
also followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Vinyl is fading fast," said Russ Soloman, president of the 54-store Tower 
Records chain in Sacramento. "Companies are not issuing things on vinyl because 
the active record buyer has converted to CDs." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dramatic decline in album sales has occured despite surprisingly 
widespread ownership of vinyl albums and turntables. 
</P>
<P>
Phansteihl, one of the largest manufacturers of replacement needles, reports 
that 4.5 million turntables were sold in 1988, the latest year for which the 
company has figures. In addition, Phansteihl estimates that about 60 million 
turntables are in use. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 5 million compact-disc players were sold in 1988, according to 
the Electronics Industries Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But the maker of the Finial LT-1 says it is not going to use its latest 
technical advancement to try to revive the mass consumer market for turntables. 
Instead Carillion Technology is trying to earn back its investment in the 
Finial LT-1 by marketing the 40-pound machine to broadcasters and extremely 
wealthy audiophiles who want to preserve their record collections from the 
scratches and wear and tear of stylus needles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any way they (LPs) are going to make a comeback," said Robinson. 
</P>

CHRYSLER OFFERS SHOPPERS $50 FOR A COMPARISON TEST-DRIVE

Consumers who test-drive a Chrysler Corp. product against any comparable car or 
truck will get $50 cash, even if they buy the competing vehicle, Chrysler said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer could be costly to the nation's No. 3 auto maker, which is 
seeking to cut $1 billion from its $26-billion annual budget by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
If all of Chrysler's December car buyers had test-driven another company's 
model, Chrysler would have doled out $3.2 million. That figure does not include 
sales of Chrysler trucks or consumers who test-drove a Chrysler but bought 
another brand. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever said promotion was cheap," Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said. 
"The name of the game is to get people in the driver's seat." 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers do not disclose specific incentive costs. Charles Brady, an 
automotive analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, said he does not 
think that the cost of the test-drive promotion will be exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think many people will go through the hassle for $50," Brady said. 
"Probably half of them are going to end up buying a Chrysler. When viewed in 
light of all the other incentives, that's 1/20th of a $1,000 rebate." 
</P>
<P>
The $50 test-drive offer and new incentive programs were announced by Chrysler 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca in commercials aired nationwide Sunday during the Super 
Bowl and the Senior Skins golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The new program tinkers with previous incentives and extends rebates and 
low-interest financing deals through the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from the extended program are Chrysler's popular minivans. Incentive 
offers on those vehicles will expire on Wednesday as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who bought a Chrysler under incentive plans announced Dec. 15 that 
were scheduled to expire Wednesday will receive the difference if Chrysler 
increases the incentive through Sept. 30.

LOWER PRICES ON RJR BONDS HURT MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices sank, weighed down by worries that interest rates may have to move 
higher to attract bidders to the government's impending auction of new 
securities next month. 
</P>
<P>
Another sharp decline in the prices of RJR Nabisco bonds added to the market's 
nervous tenor. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/8 point, or about $6.25 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.57% from 8.51% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the market for high-yielding junk bonds, prices of RJR Nabisco securities 
took another tumble in heavy dealings. Traders said prices of various RJR 
issues dropped by between $30 and $70 for every $1,000 in face value on top of 
declines of between $50 and $80 per $1,000 in face value Friday. 
</P>

MARKETING: FOR SOME ADVERTISERS, PRINT PARODIES ARE BECOMING SERIOUS BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, Daniel Simons spends nearly a quarter of a million dollars on print 
ads targeted at bald men in search of nirvana. These ads are almost always the 
same: pictures of bald men before and after Simons' hair replacement company 
has woven its magic on them. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, the response to these ads has been wearing, well, thin. So Simons 
decided to do something about it. Although he kept the same "before" photo in 
the ad, he replaced the "after" shot with a photograph of a dog. An Irish 
setter, to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
"The picture of the dog gets people to read the ad," said Simons, president of 
Los Angeles-based Hair Care Replacement Center Inc. "That's all we want." What 
he didn't want -- or expect -- was a deluge of phone calls. Some came from 
advertising aficionados asking him who created the ad. (Answer: He did). But 
others were angry calls from dog lovers, incensed that he "demeaned" the dog by 
placing it in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts say parody ads -- especially in print -- are perhaps the most 
difficult ads to pull off. And parody ads are even more difficult when they 
satirize an entire category of advertising. In that arena, Simons has some 
company. These days, even missing children are not immune from advertising 
satire. 
</P>
<P>
Who hasn't received those throwaway post cards that have advertisements on the 
back and pictures of missing children on the front? Well, last week, a small 
Los Angeles radio production company sent its own version of the post cards to 
ad executives nationwide. In the right-hand corner of the cards, above the bold 
words, "Have you seen me?" they replaced the usual shots of missing children 
with zany photos of grown-ups who look, at best, deranged. 
</P>
<P>
Why are some print advertisers turning to parody in pictures -- something more 
commonly associated with TV commercials? 
</P>
<P>
"The TV generation is better at looking at pictures than at concentrating on 
words," said John O'Shaughnessy, professor of marketing at Columbia University 
in New York. "People view life through metaphors. A pictorial metaphor can be a 
dramatic way to make a point," said O'Shaughnessy. "I'm certain you'll see more 
of these." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, parody ads are a hot item on TV these days. Some regional 
advertisers have already run parodies of the Zen-like Infiniti ads that show 
flocks of geese and crashing waves. It didn't take long for McDonald's to run a 
parody of those AT&amp;T commercials that show employees talking about the 
phone company's business service. And in a new totally offbeat parody of 
familiar testimonial TV ads, Nexxus, which makes hair-care products, features a 
rancher praising how well Nexxus conditions hair -- on his prize bull. 
</P>
<P>
But ad executives say it is far more difficult to get the humor of parody 
across in print than broadcast advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"A print ad doesn't have as easily accessible a tone of voice as a TV or radio 
ad," said Bob Hoffman, president of Hoffman Creative Services, a San Francisco 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"On TV, you have sight, sound and motion," adds Leonard Pearlstein, president 
of the Los Angeles agency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. "Clients worry about the 
subtlety of parody being lost in print." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop Sarley, Bigg &amp; Bedder from mailing out the missing 
children parody post cards. In the place under the photo that usually has the 
hot line phone number, the company substituted its own phone number. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has received these missing children post cards," said John Sarley, 
president of the production company, who co-created the mailer along with Jerry 
Leibowitz. "But when people start sorting through their mail, they look at our 
post cards and say, 'What the heck is this?' We figured if we can make someone 
smile, sooner or later they'll call us." 
</P>
<P>
Even the national organization behind the real missing children ads is smiling. 
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first reaction was, this is pretty humorous," said Ernie Allen, president 
of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. "We are, however, 
concerned about something as serious as this is being parodied. But we are not 
offended. This is proof of the saturation that the program has had." 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of dog owners are offended by the Hair Replacement Center ads. 
</P>
<P>
"We received about a half dozen calls from people who felt it was disgraceful," 
said Simons. "But as far as I can tell, the only thing the dogs get out of this 
is fame." 
</P>
<P>
So, Simons now says he wants people to send him photographs of their dogs. And 
those dogs with the most homely looking mugs may be used in future ads. "You 
can't please everyone," said Simons. "But this is bound to hit home with some 
people."

Hal Riney &amp; Partners Says It Is Not for Sale 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumors to the contrary, Hal Riney &amp; Partners is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
At least that was the word Monday from Jim Travis, the New York-based president 
and chief operating officer of the San Francisco agency that created the 
original Bartles &amp; Jaymes ads. Hal Riney, the agency's founder, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not for sale," said Travis. "We have not talked with anyone, we are not 
now talking with anyone, and we have no plans to talk with anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The trade magazine Advertising Age quoted an unidentified source Monday who 
said Hal Riney had talked with a London-based agency about purchasing part of 
the company. "There's nothing to that," said Travis. "The bad part is, every 
time this gets reported, we have to call all our clients and tell them it's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Here Comes the Bride's With Lots of Ads Inside 
</P>
<P>
Here's one bride who came dressed to kill. The February/March issue of Bride's 
magazine weighs in at a hefty 3.8 pounds -- making it the largest consumer 
magazine ever published, according to Publisher Elliot Marion. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which totals 1,040 pages, is fattened by 802 pages of 
advertising. The publication is nearly 100 pages larger than last year's spring 
issue -- the time of year when many couples plan their weddings. Marion has 
sent the issue to the "Guinness Book of World Records," hoping that it will be 
officially recognized as the largest consumer magazine ever published. 
</P>
<P>
Ilissa -- a maker of bridal gowns -- purchased nearly 100 pages of advertising 
in the issue, said Marion. Such ads can cost upward of $10,000 a page. And this 
one issue brought publisher Conde Nast more than $10 million in advertising 
revenue, Marion estimated. 
</P>
<P>
What about the postage costs? Marion figures that it cost his company about 
$2.40 to mail each copy. Of course, 98% of the magazine's circulation is from 
newsstand sales. "Thank heaven for that," Marion said. 
</P>

Graphic Safety Message in Poster Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Larry Asher had all but given up on his task of creating a print ad campaign 
aimed at showing youngsters that kids who are hit by cars can be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he couldn't show 4-year-olds pictures of dead children. But shortly 
before the campaign was due, Asher, creative director at the Seattle agency 
Borders, Perrin &amp; Norrander, was walking with his 2-year-old daughter in 
the garden outside their home. There, his daughter found a dead bird -- and she 
was totally baffled by it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time I'd ever tried to explain to her what death is," said 
Asher. That gave him the idea to create posters directed at 3- to 9-year-olds 
that would link the death of small animals to cars. The posters were for the 
Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In three graphic posters, the ads show what frogs, snakes and squirrels look 
like before and after they have been run over by cars. Unlike 
"before-and-after" ads for miracle diets, the "before" pictures look delightful 
and the "after" pictures look pathetic. Underneath the photos is the headline: 
Cars Kill. 
</P>
<P>
No animals were killed to create the campaign, insists Asher. In fact, he said 
it took the photographer nearly three weeks to locate a frog, snake and 
squirrel that were already killed. Of course, the animals' dead bodies were 
rearranged a bit to be positioned something like the live ones, Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
Is all this a bit too graphic for youngsters? "Not all the schools in this area 
are using this poster," said Asher, "but we feel it stimulates conversation. 
And if one less kid is run over by a car because of this ad, well, that's a 
tradeoff we'll take any day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calling All Cars: Tattle on Air Polluters 
</P>
<P>
The clean-air fink squad is looking for a few good tattlers. 
</P>
<P>
And you can join by simply calling 1-800-CUT SMOG the next time that you see a 
car belching thick, black smoke from its tailpipe. 
</P>
<P>
That is the message behind a new ad campaign for the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. The group wants to double the estimated 130,000 calls and 
letters that it received last year from Los Angeles area residents who reported 
smoking vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Its new billboard campaign shows a picture of a car with thick smoke coming out 
of the exhaust pipe. "Report this Crime," the ad says, above the special 800 
phone number. The campaign was created by the Santa Monica agency Suissa &amp; 
Associates. "It's a tattle-tale campaign," said David Suissa, president of the 
agency. "Now, you can do something about air pollution just by picking up your 
car phone."

Alaska Air Group Inc: The Seattle-based carrier's 1989 net income climbed 14% 
from 1988 to a record $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue totaled $917 million, up 13%. For the fourth quarter, earnings plunged 
59% to $2.5 million on revenue of $223.3 million, a gain of 14%. The firm, 
which is the holding company for Alaska Airlines Inc. and Horizon Air 
Industries Inc., attributed the quarterly decline in profit to lower passenger 
fares and substantially higher fuel prices. The firm also noted that the Bay 
Area Quake and the eruption of Alaska's Redoubt Volcano diminished revenue 
while adding to operating costs.

Boeing Co.: The Seattle-based aerospace firm's 1989 net income rose 58% over 
the previous year to $973 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue jumped 19.5% to $20.3 billion. The 1989 results include $298 million 
attributable to an accounting change for income taxes. Fourth-quarter sales 
remained essentially flat at $4.8 billion, but earnings tumbled 55% to $77 
million. The company said the 48-day strike by the International Assn. of 
Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers caused delivery delays, cutting 
fourth-quarter sales by about $2 billion. The company also cited 
higher-than-anticipated lump-sum wage payments and strike disruption costs.

Compaq Computer Corp. will delay shipments of its new Deskpro 486-25 personal 
computer because of a faulty Intel Corp. chip, officials said Monday. It is the 
second problem found in the advanced microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
"About a week ago, on Monday, we were contacted by Intel just saying that there 
was an errata discovered in the 486 chip," said Nora Rice, media relations 
administrator for the Houston-based computer manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
She said Intel said that it was working to find a solution to the problem but 
that the trouble will delay introduction of the new machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We were targeting shipping the computer Feb. 1," Rice said. "But with this new 
errata, it will delay the ship date. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to understand what's causing the problem before you put in a 
fix or a work-around" that configures the computer differently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq discovered another problem with the advanced chip last fall, before 
Intel had begun shipping the microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
When Compaq unveiled the Deskpro 486-25 last November it called it the most 
powerful desktop computer yet. 
</P>
<P>
Intel's 486 chip, introduced last April, is so powerful that it will allow 
personal computers to do certain jobs now done by engineering workstations, 
minicomputers and even mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent trouble could affect other computers using the Extended 
Industry Standard Architecture, or EISA, 32-bit bus, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq has not released any of its other 486-based machines, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will be delayed, but it's safe to say they will be out within the 
first quarter."

BILL WOULD LET CUSTOMERS BLOCK CALLER ID SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
A Senate bill was introduced Monday that would require telephone companies to 
allow customers to block Caller ID, a new service that displays a caller's 
phone number before the receiver is picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) said he was in favor of the new technology but that 
customers also should have the option of not giving out their phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A privacy balance must be struck," Kohl said in introducing the Telephone 
Privacy Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Who decides whether the caller will reveal his or her number?" Kohl said. "I 
think the decision must rest with the caller." 
</P>
<P>
Caller ID, which has been available in New Jersey for more than a year and is 
just beginning to be offered in Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, 
Pennsylvania and Maryland, uses a small terminal that displays the numbers of 
incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
The number display device costs $50 or more to purchase, and the Caller ID 
service costs about $7 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Privacy rights advocates claim it is an Orwellian intrusion on individual 
privacy unless a blocking option is offered. Phone companies such as Bell 
Atlantic, which is phasing in Caller ID in the mid-Atlantic states but not 
offering blocking, say a blocking provision would defeat the purpose of the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
California has passed legislation requiring blocking be offered with Caller ID, 
and Pennsylvania allows police and domestic violence agencies to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Some telephone companies have said privacy concerns have delayed their plans to 
introduce the service. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, according to congressional 
sources, will consider Caller I.D. as part of hearings on a number of privacy 
issues this year.

OCEANSIDE AMPHITHEATER SOUGHT AS MAJOR LINK IN THEATER CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 150-foot-deep sand pit seems an inauspicious piece of real estate, but the 
site at Oceanside Boulevard and El Camino Real is a key component in Hal 
Kolker's plan to become a national player in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Kolker's La Jolla-based Spectator Corp. will soon ask city officials in 
Oceanside for permission to build a 25,000-seat, $27-million outdoor 
amphitheater that would be the site of rock concerts, symphony performances and 
Broadway-style shows. As envisioned, the theater would have 12,500 permanent 
seats, and the rest would consist of lawn seating. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside project is just one of five theaters that Kolker plans to build 
with $125 million to be raised by a Wall Street investment banking firm. The 
money would help finance outdoor theaters in suburban areas of Palm Beach, 
Fla.; Baltimore, and Chicago, and a restored indoor theater in downtown 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the developments could put Kolker in a league with entertainment 
moguls such as James M. Nederlander of Los Angeles, owner-operator of eight 
outdoor amphitheaters, including the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and the 
Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa. Controlling so many venues gives 
Nederlander -- as it would Spectator -- enormous clout in booking big name 
talent, said James Sletteland, managing director of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; 
Co., the Wall Street firm that is backing Kolker. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game is tickets, tickets, tickets," Sletteland said. "You have 
a bigger impact in booking acts if you are able to offer multiple locations. In 
addition, there is strength in unity because you have different locations and 
different seasons and therefore you can spread your revenues throughout the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Citing "economies of scale," Kolker said the live entertainment business is 
evolving the way of the movie theater business; nationwide theater chains wield 
enormous power in booking first-run movies. Noting that the concept of 
amphitheater ownership dates back to the ancient Greeks, Kolker said he may 
propose building more outdoor sites if successful with the first four. 
</P>
<P>
Local concert promoters disagree as to whether the San Diego County market can 
support the Oceanside amphitheater, with its size and 40-mile distance from 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking positively was Bill Silva, president of Bill Silva Presents, San 
Diego's largest locally based concert promoter, who said the theater would fill 
a conspicuous need for a large-scale venue. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the existence of a facility seating 20,000 to 25,000 people would 
result in San Diego attracting a number of major artists who have regularly 
passed on San Diego because the Sports Arena is not large enough, while San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium may be too large," Silva said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a facility would prove positive for both local concert-goers and San 
Diego economy in general," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
The pessimists cite San Diego's reputation as a concert market that is "softer" 
than its population might indicate. And they warn that the amphitheater could 
end up competing against the indoor sports arena proposed for downtown San 
Diego, not to mention existing facilities such as the San Diego State 
University amphitheater and the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Candidly, I don't think the market today would support the facility," said 
Brian Murphy, president of Avalon Attractions, the Encino-based concert 
promoter that books talent into the SDSU Amphitheater and the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 20 shows a year we do at the (14,000-capacity San Diego) Sports Arena, 
only a handful sell out, and the rest do between 8,000 and 12,000 tickets. 
Given the market today, they are building an amphitheater for the year 2000 
when the population might support the facility," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many performers would choose Irvine Meadows or Pacific Amphitheater 
over an Oceanside venue because the Orange County sites offer a much larger 
potential market from which to draw ticket buyers, Murphy said. Avalon also 
books talent for the Irvine Meadows amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
Kolker said his feasibility studies show that the Oceanside amphitheater needs 
only to draw 8,500 to 9,000 ticket buyers per show to succeed financially. And 
attracting people won't be a problem: Concert-goers will drive up to 90 minutes 
to see a performance, he said 
</P>
<P>
Kolker, 40, is a former vice president of the San Diego Clippers professional 
basketball franchise and a former vice president of the San Diego Sports Arena. 
He formerly worked as a personal assistant to singer Neil Diamond and held an 
executive position in Norman Lear's entertainment production company. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Kolker, Spectator Corp.'s investors include Rossetti Associates, the 
Santa Monica-based architecture firm that is designing the amphitheaters, and 
Barry L. Rosenblatt, founder of Video Library. Spectator would own the stadiums 
and promote the shows but would hire an outside firm to book the talent. Among 
the booking agents Kolker is negotiating with are MCA, Nederlander and Silva. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator has signed a contract to buy the 67-acre sand pit site from Collins 
Development for an undisclosed price, a purchase that is contingent on its 
receiving the necessary approvals to go forward with construction, Kolker said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has made presentations to Oceanside civic groups, Kolker has not 
filed a formal application for permission to build. Formidable hurdles remain: 
He must complete environmental impact studies and submit management plans for 
the noise and traffic that a theater would generate. Those hazards have already 
raised concerns among residents in the immediate neighborhood, Oceanside Mayor 
Larry Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
At peak attendance, the amphitheater could draw up to 8,000 cars to an area of 
North County already overloaded with traffic. And noise is likely to be a 
significant issue, despite Kolker's plan to build the amphitheater stage below 
street level, a design facilitated by the depth of the sand pit. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Spectator is requesting that the city of Oceanside underwrite $5 million 
in low-cost industrial development revenue bonds, with interest and principal 
to be repaid by Spectator. To justify the bonds, which are often floated by 
municipalities to help finance projects that have a demonstrable economic 
benefit, Kolker said the amphitheater will create jobs and generate at least 
$500,000 in tax revenues for Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds are critical for the feasibility of the Oceanside project because the 
high cost of land makes it difficult to "pencil out," economically, Kolker 
said. The amphitheaters that Spectator plans in other parts of the country will 
cost $18 million to $22 million each, he said, or at least $6 million less than 
the Oceanside project. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the project is still in a formative stage and that Kolker has 
yet to make a formal application with the city, Oceanside's Mayor Bagley said 
the project would benefit the city by bringing in top-quality performing acts 
to a culture-starved corner of North County. The amphitheater would also 
produce a significant increase in Oceanside's tax revenue base, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the traffic and noise as "not insoluble problems" if events are 
scheduled so as not to conflict with peak traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Kolker is negotiating to build an amphitheater on land within the boundaries of 
the South Florida Fairgrounds in Palm Beach County, Fla. Contacted on Monday, 
fair officials declined to comment on the proposal, deferring to Kolker. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator has also signed a deal to build an amphitheater in Country Club 
Hills, Ill., 20 miles south of Chicago, on a 450-acre master planned site that 
is being developed by First National Realty and Development of Chicago, one of 
the Midwest's largest shopping center developers. 
</P>
<P>
First National Realty and Development President James Dellaportas said a 
partnership deal has "already been cut" with Spectator to build a 25,000-seat 
amphitheater on the site. Country Club Hills Deputy City Manager Mary Dankowski 
said that, although she and other city officials are aware of the amphitheater 
proposal, the developers have not formally applied.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dynatech Microwave Technology, a Calabasas maker of electronic parts used in 
aerospace and defense, said it will supply Page Avjet, an Orlando, Fla., 
company, with a few hundred switches for systems that help aircraft avoid 
colliding into each other. 
</P>
<P>
It valued the contract at $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, hoping to prevent disasters similar to the 1986 
collision of an Aeromexico jetliner and a small plane above Cerritos, has 
ordered jetliners to be equipped with collision-avoidance systems. Dynatech 
Microwave said Page Avjet plans to use the switches to retrofit a fleet of 
aircraft owned and operated by Southwest Airlines.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TRANSTECHNOLOGY REPORTS 87% DECLINE IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TransTechnology Corp. of Sherman Oaks reported that earnings for the fiscal 
third quarter that ended Dec. 31 plunged 87% to $348,000 from $2.6 million a 
year earlier. Revenue fell 14% to $51 million from $59 million. 
</P>
<P>
TransTechnology makes a variety of products for the defense and industrial 
markets, including fasteners, hoists and computer workstations. The company, 
which reported losses in the previous two quarters, has been hurt by slow 
sales, losses on fixed-price government contracts, costs of consolidating 
operations, inventory writedowns and costs of product development. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended Dec. 31, TransTechnology reported a loss of $3.8 
million, in contrast to a $4-million profit in the year-earlier period. Revenue 
was $142.5 million, down 10% from $159 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: AMWEST INSURANCE GROUP EXPECTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amwest Insurance Group, a Woodland Hills provider of bail bonds and other 
surety bonds, said it expects to report a loss of between $750,000 and $1 
million for the fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Amwest blamed the deficit in part on numerous claims made against contractors' 
bonds underwritten by Amwest. 
</P>
<P>
When it issues such bonds, Amwest promises to pay to finish a construction 
project if the contractor can't finish it for any reason. The bonds at issue 
were partially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, but the 
claims still helped produce a loss, Amwest said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also will reflect additional reserves that Amwest has been setting 
aside because of Proposition 103, an insurance-reform measure whose 
implementation is still being debated by state authorities. A key part of the 
measure is a rollback in customers' premiums, and Amwest has created the 
reserves in the event it must pay rebates. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Amwest said, it expects to post a profit of $1.31 million to 
$1.59 million, down from earnings of $3.62 million in 1988. The exact figures 
should be released in mid-February, Amwest said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: POLLUTION RESEARCH REPORTS $137,000 QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pollution Research &amp; Control in Glendale said it lost $137,000 in its 
fiscal second quarter, compared with a $107,000 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research, a maker of pollution-measuring devices and formerly named 
Dasibi Environmental Corp., said the loss for the three months that ended Dec. 
31 came on an increase in sales to $1.51 million from $1.11 million. The 
company said the loss included costs related to its acquisition of Air 
Instruments &amp; Measurements Inc. last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Pollution Research lost $316,000 
compared with a year-earlier profit of $275,000, and its six-month sales 
climbed to $2.76 million from $2.25 million.

she is scheduled to argue her own case before the New Jersey Supreme Court. 
Lawyers for the Tiger and Ivy clubs argue that the groups are purely private.

SPECIALIZED SERIES TO BE ADDED TO SUMMERPOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
What SummerPops audiences want, SummerPops audiences get. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to target the particular musical tastes of its pops patrons, the 
San Diego Symphony announced Monday that the 1990 SummerPops will be divided 
into five series. Besides the main series of six weeks of standard pops 
offerings, this summer's 12-week season (June 20 through Sept. 10) will have 
four specialized series: great classical composers, Russian Romantics, 
selections from Broadway musicals and a Big Band series. 
</P>
<P>
According to executive director Wesley 
</P>
<P>
Brustad -- who planned SummerPops '90, to be held at Hospitality Point on 
Mission Bay -- the significant revisions were made in response to the varied 
programming interests of last year's pops patrons, who answered an extensive 
end-of-the-season questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 season-opening concert, an all-Ravel program, will feature Canadian 
conductor Boris Brott, who has led the local symphony in two guest stints over 
the past year. Brott's program, June 20-23, will be the first week of generic 
pops offerings, a series that will continue every other week through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The other four series will share a split-week schedule in the intervening 
weeks. Subscriptions will be offered in both six- and three-week packages. 
Symphony officials noted that in recent years, shorter series have become 
easier to market. 
</P>
<P>
Though single-ticket prices were not announced, the range of subscription 
prices starts at $20 for three Wednesday night gallery seats to $725 for six 
weekend nights at a Champagne cabaret table. The subscription prices for Friday 
and Saturday night pops series are slightly higher in every seating category 
than those for Wednesday and Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Another innovation includes dancing, and a dance floor will be set up for 
patrons at the Sunday evening Big Band performances. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guest conductors this summer are Lalo Schifrin, popular composer and 
music director of the Glendale Symphony; Norman Leyden, music director of the 
Seattle Symphony Pops, and Kate Tamarkin, newly appointed associate conductor 
of the Dallas Symphony. Harmonica virtuoso Larry Adler will be the featured 
soloist July 18-21, although the season promises fewer guest soloists than 
last. 
</P>
<P>
If the symphony has its way, this will be its final year at the Mission Bay 
outdoor site, which is plagued by airplane noise. Construction of a new outdoor 
pops venue on San Diego Bay next to Seaport Village, called Embarcadero Marina 
Park South, is still being negotiated with the San Diego Unified Port District. 
Last week, the symphony received approval to proceed with actual plans for the 
site, although the environmental impact report has yet to be made and filed. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of the San Diego Bay site include a minimum seating of 4,000, 
contrasted with 3,200 at Hospitality Point (home to SummerPops since 1983), and 
its proximity to the San Diego Convention Center and major downtown tourist 
hotels.

CRITIC AT LARGE: BUCKING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM -- SOME HOLLYWOOD SUCCESS STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood often appears to guide itself exclusively on conventional wisdom, an 
amalgam of "If it worked before, try it again," "If if works, don't fix it" and 
(as Adlai Stevenson once described Republican policies), "Try anything, but 
never for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
The operating principles of Hollywood wisdom include Action in Summer, Feelies 
in Fall, Biggies at Christmas and Happy Endings Anytime. But the conventionally 
wise are going to have a tough time fitting 1989 into the comforting patterns 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
In the films that are certain to be prime Academy Award contenders: one ends 
with everyone you cared about killed in battle; in another, the heroine is at 
last having to be spoon-fed in a nursing home; in another, the beautiful young 
heroine dies after childbirth; in another, the handsome young hero ends as a 
paraplegic in a wheelchair; yet another centers on a teen-age suicide and the 
dismissal in disgrace of a charismatic teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The list can be extended easily, to a protagonist who is an almost totally 
crippled cerebral palsy victim, to a marital comedy so dark and lethal you 
almost need a flashlight to see the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The conventionally wise might say that, ah, well, there are always tough films, 
but they never make money. The surprise (heartening to anyone who cares about 
the state of the movies) is that all these tragedy-toned films are doing or 
have done very well at the box office -- better than some starry attractions 
("We're No Angels," "Family Business") that had little on their minds but what 
is known in the trade as sheer entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that there will have to be a new commandment on the tablet of 
conventional wisdom: Try a little bravery; it couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the offerings have not been revolutionary. One piece of conventional 
wisdom that has not been overturned is that audiences don't mind and may 
welcome a good cry; it's that they don't like to go away depressed or convinced 
that the world is beyond redemption. 
</P>
<P>
The slaughter at Fort Wagner, S.C., that concludes "Glory" is at least as 
compelling a statement about and against war as "All Quiet on the Western 
Front." But the film, directed by Edward Zwick and written by Kevin Jarre, also 
illuminates an important piece of American history: the creation and the brief, 
valiant exploits of the first black regiment in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rich human drama that carries the reverberating truth of history and as 
an act of film making it is amazing in its scope and smoky realism. The Civil 
War battles, as they were fought, have never been so well depicted on screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July," regarded as the short-odds favorite in the Oscar 
sweepstakes, is another piece of American history, recreating Ron Kovic's life 
from gung-ho Marine to embittered paraplegic fighting against the war, and 
echoing the larger national turmoil about Vietnam. Its scenes of battle, of a 
rat-infested VA hospital, of family divisions and private anguish, are brutal 
and uncompromised, but ultimately there is a cleansing and triumphant uplift. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish-made "My Left Foot" succeeds on the power of Daniel Day-Lewis's 
portrayal of Christy Brown, the severely crippled cerebral palsy victim who by 
force of will became a poet, painter and novelist. The later years were sad for 
both Brown and the woman he married. But the film leaves him at the peak of his 
triumphant happiness and it's the possibility of hope that the audience carries 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"Steel Magnolias" and "Driving Miss Daisy," both expert middle-class comedies 
drawn from successful plays, were nevertheless daring in the eyes of 
conventional thinking: the former virtually an all-women's film with the men as 
ciphers on the fringe and with a tragic death as its centerpiece. The latter 
watches an elderly Jewish widow and an elderly black widower grow older. Not, 
you'd have said, sure-fire stuff despite the play's success and not, as it 
turned out, a cinch to get financed. 
</P>
<P>
But at the heart of both films is sharp and sympathetic observation of loving 
relationships. The authors, Robert Harling of "Magnolias" and Alfred Uhry of 
"Miss Daisy," obviously evoked responses in their audiences in matters of 
parenthood, tolerance and compassion. And the performances, directed by Herbert 
Ross and Bruce Beresford, respectively, are smashing. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" defied the wisdom on summer fare, as being about school, 
literature, frustration and suicide. Not a car crash in sight. It was not that 
great a risk, in retrospect, with Robin Williams as its star and a theme -- 
young people in contention with their elders -- certain to appeal to young 
audiences. And, as written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir, it is a 
first-rate film. But the early summer opening defied that old devil 
conventional wisdom, raising again the treasonable thought that decisions may 
be conventional but not necessarily wise. 
</P>
<P>
"War of the Roses" is unrelenting in its cynical view of marriage, no last-reel 
forgivenesses, a defiance of the film proprieties. It divides viewers sharply 
between love and hate, but presumably there are enough customers who've had 
searing matrimonial experiences to make the Danny DeVito film written by 
Michael Leeson from a novel by Warren Adler a hit. 
</P>
<P>
There seems finally no substitute for a nice, healthy defiance of the rules, 
and for following a particular passion to get a film written, cast and made as 
passion would have it. The year's best films -- "Glory," "Born on the Fourth of 
July" and "My Left Foot" high among them -- play as works of passion, not 
calculation, conventional wisdoms thankfully ignored.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSICSERIOUSLY NOW, IT'S NOT EASY BEING THE 
FUNSTER OF FUGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Schickele is the 20th Century's preeminent case of musical schizophrenia: 
two distinct composers forced to inhabit the same person. 
</P>
<P>
The serious Schickele turns out commissions with respectable titles such as 
String Quartet No. 3, "Monochrome VI" and "Dream Dances" for flute, oboe and 
cello. The other Schickele -- who uses the name P.D.Q. Bach -- pens works named 
Schleptet in E-flat Major, the "Unbegun" Symphony, "Fuga Meshuga" and a 
full-length opera titled "The Abduction of Figaro." 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem with having two personalities is that some people don't know 
that I do serious stuff," Schickele complained. "Not too long ago, I learned 
that a performing group applied to a foundation for a grant to commission a 
work from me. They were turned down because the foundation said that P.D.Q. 
Bach was too commercial. Even when the group informed the foundation that Peter 
Schickele also wrote serious music, they were still unwilling to award the 
grant." 
</P>
<P>
That P.D.Q. Bach is a commercial success, however, is beyond argument. Over the 
past 15 years, this completely mythical son of J. S. Bach (whose more famous 
composer offspring are also universally known by their initials, such as 
C.P.E., J.C.F. and W.F.) has captured the American market on musical parody. 
This Friday and Saturday at Symphony Hall, the San Diego Symphony will perform 
a pair of concerts devoted to some of the more immortal works of P.D.Q. Bach, 
including the famous version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony narrated as a 
sportscast (KSDO-AM sports director Ron Reina will assist in this taxing 
intellectual feat), "Chaconne a son Gout" and Variations on "An Unusually 
Simple-Minded Theme" for piano and orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
On the podium will be yet another Schickele persona, Professor Peter Schickele, 
the conductor and musicologist who has "discovered" the lost oeuvre of P.D.Q. 
Bach. Of course, the real Schickele is not really a professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it is hard to prove my credentials at the University of Southern North 
Dakota at Hoople," Schickele admitted when pressed by a skeptical reporter. 
"But I taught at Juilliard in the early 1960s," he protested. Although the 
non-professor's university is as bogus as P.D.Q. Bach -- whose dates are always 
given as (1807-1742)? -- Hoople is quite real. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there really is a Hoople, a town of 400 located northwest of Grand Forks, 
North Dakota, near the Canadian border. Once, when I played a concert in Grand 
Forks, I was presented with the key to the city by the mayor of Hoople." No 
doubt the key opened both doors there. 
</P>
<P>
Schickele attributes his primary inspiration to the American musical humorist 
Spike Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I was introduced to the recordings of Spike Jones at the age of 9 or 10. In 
fact, my brother and I would lip-sync his records and even did this as 
entertainment for Kiwanis Club lunches." He also credits as influential the 
early recordings of England's zany Hoffnung Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Schickele's earliest forays into the strange world of P.D.Q. Bach occurred 
during his college years, while he was at home in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer of 1953, I was home from Swarthmore College, where I was a 
student. Some friends and I were fooling around with tape recorders, and three 
of us made a recording of one of the Bach Brandenburg Concertos. They played 
all the strings parts, and I played all the wind parts on bassoon two octaves 
too low, something that sounded rather like mud wrestling. The next week I came 
up with a piece called the 'Sanka' Cantata. Although I don't clearly remember 
whose idea the name P.D.Q. Bach was, my buddie Ernie Lloyd's mother claims her 
son came up with it." 
</P>
<P>
When Schickele taught at Juilliard, he and his colleagues would give an annual 
concert of his musical parodies under the baton of Jorge Mester. In 1965, 
Schickele made his professional debut as P.D.Q. Bach at New York's Town Hall, 
and the rest is demented history. 
</P>
<P>
If Schickele is known for his pun-filled titles, crude sight gags and on stage 
pratfalls, he is quick to point out the serious craft behind his P.D.Q. Bach 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
"For all its ineptness," he said, "the secret weapon in my P.D.Q. Bach writing 
is solid construction and musical ideas interesting enough for someone to 
listen a second and third time. After all, once you know the punch line, you 
know the joke. A P.D.Q. Bach piece needs more than a good joke to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Strong, silent type. Romanian pianist Radu Lupu will play a recital at 8 p.m. 
Thursday at the Civic Theatre, but the reclusive musician refuses to be 
interviewed or cooperate with the usual promotional gambits. Winner of the 1966 
Van Cliburn piano competition (and a slew of others), Lupu has an impressive 
list of recordings, including all the Beethoven piano concertos with Zubin 
Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a music critic for the Baltimore Sun tricked Lupu into giving a 
short interview under the ruse that Lupu's upcoming University of Maryland 
recital had been turned into a benefit for Romanian relief. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no mystery about me -- I don't like to be interviewed because I don't 
like to talk about myself," the 44-year-old pianist told the Sun critic. "A 
musician should not have to be sold as if he were toothpaste. I would rather 
have 300 people come to hear the music than have a crowd of 3,000 who have been 
seduced by publicity to come hear a 'stage personality.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, Lupu's local 
sponsor, they would rather have 3,000 people in Civic Theatre to hear Lupu for 
any reason whatsoever. No questions asked.

Dialogue on the "Dialogues." Conductor Richard Bonynge and San Diego Opera's 
music administrator, Karen Keltner, will discuss Francis Poulenc's "Dialogues 
of the Carmelites" in the Beverly Sills Salon at Civic Theatre at 5:30 p.m. 
Thursday. The local company's popular lecture series precedes each production 
of the season with an informative preview. (This Poulenc production opens Feb. 
10.) Bonynge, who knew Poulenc, and Keltner, who studied music in France, will 
share their insights into the composer's landmark contemporary opera. The 
opera, which was first performed in 1956, is about a religious community caught 
in the anti-church excesses of the French Revolution.

Going, Going: Lloyd Richards, dean of the Yale School of Drama and artistic 
director of the Yale Repertory Theatre since 1979, will leave both posts in 
June, 1991. The announcement was made Sunday by Benno C. Schmidt Jr., president 
of Yale University, who added that a faculty committee has been appointed to 
search for a successor. Richards, whose staging of August Wilson's "The Piano 
Lesson" is at the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, brought Wilson's work to 
national prominence while at Yale. CLAUDIA PUIG

Into the Night With Rick Dees: While still being heard in the early mornings, 
KIIS-FM morning man Rick Dees will soon be seen on late-night television in an 
ABC comedy show premiering in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Into the Night" which will air Monday through Friday following "Nightline" 
from midnight to 1, has been described as a "comedy hour of unpredictable 
events, supported by a family of regular comedy players and guest stars." Dees, 
who has been at KIIS since 1982, has had one of the top-rated morning shows for 
the past six years. He also hosts the syndicated "The Weekly Top 40," which 
airs on more than 300 radio stations. CLAUDIA PUIG

More Lucy: CBS said Monday it has commissioned production of a TV movie about 
the late Lucille Ball, whose "I Love Lucy" series in the '50s helped boost the 
network to high ratings. 
</P>
<P>
No actress has been chosen to play Ball, a spokesman said. The film, covering 
the period when Ball was married to bandleader Desi Arnaz, will air during the 
1990-91 season. Ball died last April at the age of 77. CLAUDIA PUIG

CURRIE LEADS MASTER CHORALE AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Currie may be a lame duck, but he's not going to roll over and play dead. 
Sunday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center, the 
departing music director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, abetted by a solid 
quartet of soloists and a well-chosen program, led persuasive, spirited 
performances -- perhaps to prove the point. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the concert featured the premiere of a revised version of 
"Mid-Winter Songs on Poems by Robert Graves" by the USC-based composer Morten 
Lauridsen. 
</P>
<P>
This elegant and engaging setting of five "winter" poems by the English writer 
is firmly in the American tradition. The spacious orchestration, jazz rhythms, 
widely spaced harmonies peppered with sevenths and ninths and intricate, sinewy 
counterpoint are recognizable points of reference. 
</P>
<P>
Its ready accessibility is not derived from its sources, however, but from the 
direct and effective setting of the words, the use of brief, unifying melodic 
fragments and the evocative backdrop provided by the orchestra. Currie led a 
dramatically shaped and technically competent performance. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded the program with Haydn's "Mass in Time of War," a work whose 
joyousness belies its title. The Master Chorale captured its full exuberance 
with a big, bright, well-balanced sound and emphatic phrasing. The solo quartet 
-- soprano Cynthia Westphal Johnson, mezzo Paula Rasmussen, tenor Bruce 
Johnson, baritone Peter Van Derick -- were particularly well-matched, and 
provided serene, mellifluous contrast. The orchestra supported with vitality, 
though it occasionally lagged. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with a sprightly, rough-hewn account of the brief 
"Magnificat" attributed to, but not unquestionably by, Pergolesi.TIMOTHY MANGAN

MARIA CASALE GIVES HARP RECITAL AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it's easy to take for granted an outstanding performance when 
confidence and control are second nature to a musician. Yet when harpist Maria 
Casale breezed through her recital Sunday evening in Hancock Auditorium at USC, 
few in the audience -- many harpists themselves -- doubted that they were 
hearing anything less than musicianship of the highest quality. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Harp Society, the event 
consisted of a collection of showy pieces of moderate length, most from the 
Romantic era. In each, the Juilliard-trained virtuoso demonstrated her 
comprehensive technique and commanding, vigorous style. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the technically challenging works could be considered a major 
undertaking, the Sonata in G by C.P.E. Bach proved especially provocative. The 
Classical style presented few problems for Casale, who shaped each phrase 
expertly, stressing simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
An Impromptu by Albert Roussel in a quirky, early 20th-Century style gave 
Casale a different type of challenge, which she met authoritatively. A 
multifarious fabric of dissonances and complex textures also made Bernard 
Andres' impressionist "Absidioles" pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
Transcriptions of music by Respighi, Albeniz and Falla by Casale's teacher 
Susann McDonald and eminent harpist Marcel Grandjany similarly tested her 
prevailing virtuosity.GREGG WAGER

AUDUBON QUARTET AT BILTMORE IN HISTORIC SITES SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Audubon Quartet made a stunning impression at its local debut two years 
ago, disclosing maturity of expression and smoothly functioning internal 
dynamics that belied the Virginia- based group's brief history. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening, on the occasion of its return -- presented, as before, by 
Chamber Music in Historic Sites -- the four artists displayed equal technical 
fluency and interpretive conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in locales did, however, produce altered results. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, under the enriching Tiffany dome of the Doheny Mansion, the Audubons 
projected quasi-orchestral sonorities without sacrificing linear clarity. On 
Sunday, when Bernard's restaurant in the Biltmore Hotel was converted into a 
viable 200-seat concert hall, a decidedly leaner, but by no means unappealing 
tone was discernible. 
</P>
<P>
Another marked difference between then and now was the program. Previously, the 
juxtaposition of attractively quirky, vastly dissimilar rarities by Haydn and 
Peter Schickele and the familiar fireworks of Smetana's "From My Life" made for 
a revelatory evening. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the players -- violinists David Ehrlich and David Salness, violist 
Doris Lederer, cellist Thomas Shaw -- were less enterprising, offering 
everybody's favorite warm-up piece, the Mozart Quartet in G, K. 387, followed 
by the ubiquitous Debussy Quartet, and Schumann's warts-and-all beauty in A 
major, Opus 41, No. 3, less familiar to general audiences but no novelty for 
the chamber music crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The totality proved mildly disappointing for its lack of adventure and lack of 
coherency, the immense worth of each component notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Still, amid these safe pleasures one could savor the unexaggeratedly Romantic 
interpretations, immaculate ensemble balance and rhythmic vitality of the 
Audubon Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
We should always have it so bad.HERBERT GLASS

LONG BEACH ARTS FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HINDU SAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A five-hour banquet of Indian music and dance in honor of the Hindu saint 
Puramdara Daasa at the Terrace Theater in Long Beach Saturday night proved a 
richly satisfying feast. 
</P>
<P>
If a Westerner's attention flagged now and then, a new tidbit soon brought the 
appetite back. 
</P>
<P>
Act I traced the story of Puramdara's life and Act II evoked scenes from the 
life of Krishna, the subject of many of Puramdara's songs. 
</P>
<P>
Viji Prakash, a specialist in the ancient temple dance form, Bharata Natyam, 
assembled a large cast performing in several distinct musical and dance styles. 
Prakash, who has large, classically proportioned features and a dazzling smile, 
moved with a lithe ease. As the young Krishna tugging amorously at a maid's 
sari, she was amusingly believable. 
</P>
<P>
Kathak dancer Chitresh Das combined pliant and delicate movements of the 
wrists, fingers and arms with powerful spins and brilliantly percussive 
footwork. Shifting moods drifted across his expressive face like cloud patterns 
in unstable weather. 
</P>
<P>
Shyly graceful Odissi dancer Nandita Behera traced the gently rounded shapes -- 
arched arms, one cantilevered hip -- of this rarely seen form, based on temple 
sculptures at Orissa. Angular lunges and jabs flavored Ramaa Bharadvaj's 
interpretation of the Kuchipudi dance form. Although her small face puts her at 
a theatrical disadvantage, tall Mythili Kumar infuses Bharata Natyam with a 
serene grace. 
</P>
<P>
The most extraordinary performer was the singer Lakshmi Shankar, a 
grandmotherly woman sitting with downcast eyes, who produces effortless, long 
phrases of otherworldly sound. Violinist Viji Krishnan-Natarajan, veena player 
Geetha Ramanathan Bennett and mridangam (drum) player Frank Bennett must also 
be singled out for improvising moments of great poignancy and beauty. CATHY

'TALKING TO THE ENEMY' -- RAW EMOTIONS, ESSENTIAL TRUTHS

Chaim Shur and Muna Hamzeh are far apart not only in age, but also in politics. 
He's a Zionist. She's an anti-Zionist. 
</P>
<P>
He lost a son in a reprisal raid on the PLO after the Munich massacre. On her 
wall hangs a photograph of her with Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Shur is Israeli. Hamzeh is Palestinian. They share very little and they share 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
What they share are pain and loss. 
</P>
<P>
Shur, a 60ish magazine editor living on a kibbutz in the Negev, and Hamzeh, a 
young journalist in Washington, are the central protagonists of "Talking to the 
Enemy," Mira Hamermesh's moving documentary that humanizes the terrible 
conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Made in 1987 for Britain's Channel Four, it premieres here at 10 tonight on PBS 
Channels 28, 15 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting in Washington in 1985, Shur and Hamzeh corresponded, and he 
invited her to visit him and his family on their kibbutz. At first Hamzeh 
balked. During the course of this film, however, the Jewish, Polish-born 
Hamermesh shows how the kibbutz meeting ultimately does come about. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking to the Enemy" is marred by occasional bad audio and is unfocused and 
disjointed in spots. Yet the emotions captured on the screen are so raw and 
genuine -- and the ironies of this long-standing Israeli-Palestinian antagonism 
so sensitively shown -- that the film's inelegance is far overshadowed by its 
essential truths. 
</P>
<P>
When revisiting her childhood home in Haifa that is now in Israeli hands, 
Hamzeh cannot contain her sobs or rage and admits that, at that moment, "there 
is a side of me that can fight and carry a gun." Yet later on the kibbutz, she 
cries along with Shur's wife as the Israeli woman mourns the loss of her son in 
combat against the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar stereotypes -- Zionism means racism and Palestinian nationalism is 
synonymous with terrorism -- are attacked here. Hamermesh, however, is too 
honest a film maker to inject gratuitous optimism. Shur and Hamzeh agree that 
"more blood will be shed." Made more than three years ago, their prediction 
proves them prophets as well as enemies.

Padberg was quoted as saying local Republicans are loyal but not stupid and 
Quayle would have to prove himself. 
</P>

"Nothing I said could be construed close to what came out," Padberg complained. 
The article's author, Newport Beach attorney Jerry Werksman, scoffed at 
Padberg's denial. "I'll show my notes to anyone," he said. Mark I. Pinsky and

DNA DOUBTS: The sheriff's genetic testing lab, due to open soon (B4), is being 
heralded as a boon to law enforcement, but at least one UC Irvine expert has 
his doubts. . . . Lawyer/psychologist William C. Thompson, an assistant social 
ecology professor, testified for the defense in a Minnesota case where a man 
was being linked to a murder based on DNA testing of his blood, done by a 
commercial crime lab. . . . The Minnesota Supreme Court later threw out use of 
the DNA evidence, criticizing inadequate quality control at the testing lab.

$1.23-TRILLION BUDGET HAS NO MAJOR CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush Monday proposed a $1.23-trillion fiscal 1991 budget that calls 
for holding a tight rein on federal spending but avoids sweeping changes in 
government priorities and contemplates only relatively modest tinkering with 
the vast array of national defense and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike former President Ronald Reagan, whose policies resulted in enormous 
deficits and a major shift in resources from domestic programs to the Pentagon, 
Bush largely accepts the status quo in his first full-scale spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
He would cut the budget deficit by about half, to $63.1 billion, by trimming a 
host of programs and relying on the continuing health of the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
He forecasts a set of conditions that most economists regard as unlikely: 
robust economic growth to drive tax revenues up and declining interest rates to 
force the government's borrowing costs down. 
</P>
<P>
True to his frequently stated pledge, he would not raise general tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bush wants to spend somewhat more on space exploration, scientific research, 
drug enforcement, education and the environment for the 1991 fiscal year, which 
will begin Oct. 1. He would restrain federal outlays on defense, Medicare, 
federal retirement and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman, invoking a character from the 
children's television show "Sesame Street," likens federal spending to the 
"Ultimate Cookie Monster," who doesn't really mean much harm but whose 
"excessive tendencies toward consumption are not exactly ennobling." 
</P>
<P>
But Darman, in a provocative introduction to the 1,569-page document, points 
out that the budget "is not just a monstrous mass of cookies and crumbs. It is 
more: an implicit statement of values and expectations for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The budget revives Bush's proposal to cut taxes on capital gains. It recommends 
allowing all but the highest-income families to set aside up to $5,000 a year 
in savings in special accounts in which earnings would accumulate tax free. It 
proposes to permit first-time home buyers to withdraw up to $10,000 from 
existing individual retirement accounts without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moynihan Challenged 
</P>
<P>
In challenging a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N. Y.) aimed at 
cutting Social Security taxes by $55 billion in 1991, Bush suggests that the 
rising Social Security surplus should continue to be set aside so that 
government funds, starting in the mid-1990s, could be used to whittle down the 
$3-trillion federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's plan for the 1991 fiscal year calls for a mixture of 
spending cuts and increases that, together, would save about $18 billion, 
largely from domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side of the ledger, the budget recommends numerous small changes 
in taxes and user fees -- many of which Congress has rejected in the past -- 
that would add up to $19.5 billion in additional income for the government. 
</P>
<P>
It includes what the budget frankly identifies as at least one "gimmick" -- a 
speed-up in the collection of payroll taxes from employers. It assumes that 
tougher IRS enforcement would collect an extra $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's proposal, which is sure to be challenged by Congress, new Pentagon 
budget authority would rise slightly next year to $295 billion. Actual spending 
would fall $3.9 billion short of the amount necessary to keep up with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
That modest initial defense budget savings, Darman wrote, makes a mockery of 
those who are already contemplating how to allocate a large "peace dividend" as 
a result of the sharply diminished military threat from the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington entertains the notion of spending 50 times a dividend that has not 
yet definitively materialized -- a true Wonderland phenomenon," Darman argued 
in his introduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debate on Savings 
</P>
<P>
Despite Darman's disclaimer, the debate over where to allocate money saved by 
cutting Pentagon spending is likely to dominate the political arena this year 
and in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the budget director conceded in a television interview on Sunday that 
the "peace dividend over the long term could be as large as people are saying. 
It could be well over $100 billion, well over $150 billion; by some counting, 
even over $200 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the budget was released, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
emerged from a White House meeting with the prediction that Congress would 
demand a "larger reduction" in defense spending than Bush recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats on Capitol Hill, mindful of Bush's strong standing in public opinion 
polls, avoided denouncing his budget as "dead on arrival," as they often did 
with Reagan's spending proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) referred to 
Bush's proposal as a "stand-pat budget. I don't think it's a budget that really 
meets our needs." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush Administration officials strongly defended their budget proposals, 
arguing that they are necessary to foster a healthy economic climate at a time 
when economic growth has ground virtually to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the slowdown in the fourth quarter makes everybody nervous," 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said at a briefing for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason, Brady said, that "we must meet the Gramm-Rudman target 
without raising taxes and take important steps towards encouraging long-term 
investment in our country's economic future." 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law mandates a deficit no higher than $64 
billion in 1991 and a balanced budget by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Predicament 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Boskin, the White House's chief economist, acknowledged that the 
Administration is caught in a predicament: Its budget goals rely on achieving 
major economic gains, but the economic goals depend not only on cooperation 
from the Federal Reserve but also on a deficit-reduction agreement between 
Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forecast is conditional on the President's proposals being adopted," 
Boskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Director Darman, in his 15-page budget introduction, lambasted Congress 
for fiscal irresponsibility. He argued that hidden "Pac-Men" threaten to gobble 
up future government resources, and he defended Bush's relatively modest budget 
initiatives as "investments in the future." 
</P>
<P>
But Darman, who has attempted to overcome his reputation in Washington for 
arrogance, may have pushed his wit and eloquence a bit too far for some tastes. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by a reporter whether the budget was written "by a man who may be 
another Sesame Street character, 'Oscar the Grouch,' " Darman replied: "That 
may be the kindest thing that's said of me." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Bush's $1.23-trillion budget would be one of the most austere in 
recent memory, attempting to hold fiscal 1991 spending to just a 3% increase, 
well below the expected rate of inflation of 4.2%. But it may be hard for Bush 
to keep spending down. Last year, federal outlays rose 7.5% after increasing 6% 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robust economic growth, with a little additional push from Bush's modest new 
tax and user fee proposals, is projected by the budget to propel revenues up by 
9%, to $1.17 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant elements of the Bush budget is his decision to 
begin scaling back on defense. With the Cold War on the wane, the Pentagon 
budget calls for eliminating 38,000 troops and closing dozens of military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
"Remarkable changes have occurred during the past year," Bush said. "The Berlin 
Wall has been opened, and democratic forces are on the move in Eastern Europe. 
As a result, savings in the defense budget are now possible." 
</P>
<P>
Bush contended that Soviet military capability "will remain formidable, even 
after announced reductions," and said he was proposing a cautious start to 
reducing the Pentagon budget that would allow the nation "to hedge against an 
uncertain future." 
</P>
<P>
Tax Cut Plan Revived 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter partisan fight last year over his proposal to cut taxes on 
capital gains -- profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and the 
like -- Bush revived his plan in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is supposed to generate an extra $4.9 billion in revenues 
in 1991 by stimulating extra turnover of investments, would give increased tax 
breaks for assets that are held longer. By excluding 30% of the gain, the tax 
rate for most investors would be 19.6% on assets held for three years. But 
assets held for just two years would be taxed at 22.4% and those held one year 
would be taxed at 25.2%. That compares with a normal top rate of 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Even many lawmakers who oppose the plan as a giveaway to the wealthy concede 
that some type of capital gains proposal is likely to be passed by Congress 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
For less affluent taxpayers, Bush is proposing a far-reaching initiative that 
would create a major new tax haven for savings. A so-called family savings 
account would allow a family with income of less than $120,000 to contribute as 
much as $5,000 to a tax-exempt account. Single persons with incomes up to 
$60,000 would be allowed to contribute $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
There would be no initial tax deduction, which means the proposal would 
constitute only a minor drain on the Treasury in its early years. But, after 
seven years, the money could be withdrawn without owing any taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUDGET TIMETABLE 
</P>
<P>
Monday -- President Bush submits to Congress his fiscal 1991 budget, which, 
under the Gramm-Rudman law, must project a deficit no greater than $64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
April 15 -- Congress is supposed to adopt a budget resolution, meeting the 
$64-billion target, to guide subsequent spending and tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
June 15 -- Congress to make any changes necessary in existing laws to achieve 
spending and revenue changes called for in the budget resolution. (This has not 
been done in previous years.) 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 25 -- OMB issues a report on the estimated fiscal 1991 deficit, based on 
spending and tax legislation enacted up to Aug. 15. If the deficit exceeds the 
$64-billion target by more than $10 billion, the President issues an order 
cutting most domestic and defense programs sufficiently to reach $64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1 -- Fiscal 1991 begins. If Congress still has not cut the deficit to $64 
billion, the President imposes automatic spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 15 -- OMB issues a final report, revised to account for recent 
congressional action. If Congress still has not trimmed the deficit, the 
President issues a final order making the spending cuts permanent.

MODESTO'S MAIL-IN BALLOT MAY MARK A MODEL VOTE 
</P>

<P>
Political consultants believe that they have seen the future of California 
elections, and it is in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented use of absentee ballots has focused statewide attention on an 
otherwise obscure special election today for an Assembly seat representing this 
northern San Joaquin Valley city and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
With both the Democratic and Republican candidates spurring voters to use the 
absentee system, about half the expected voters already have cast their 
ballots. Barring an unexpectedly large turnout at the polls, the percentage of 
absentee votes in the race will easily set a record for California, according 
to the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, the 27th Assembly District contest will become a possible 
model for how California elections will be waged in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultants view voting by mail in advance of elections as an 
effective campaign tool because these are votes the candidate can bank on, 
votes that can't be swayed by final-hour appeals from the opposition. Also, by 
studying which neighborhoods are returning absentee ballots, campaign managers 
can study apparent voting trends and adjust their strategy accordingly. And 
after years of declining voter turnout, the widespread use of absentee ballots 
could significantly increase the number of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The absentee ballot is going to change how politics is played in California in 
the years to come," said Bernd Schwieren, a political consultant who is the 
campaign manager for Richard Lang, the Republican candidate in the 27th 
District race. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of absentee votes in the contest became so competitive that the 
state Republican Party created a campaign controversy by hiring Kelly Services 
and other temporary workers to walk precincts and collect absentee ballot 
applications. In addition to their hourly salary, the workers were paid $1 for 
each absentee ballot application they collected. 
</P>
<P>
Today's special election was called to fill the vacancy left when former 
Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Democrat, won election to Congress last fall. Condit 
replaced Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned his seat amid controversy over his 
personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break With Tradition 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, absentee ballots were only used by people unable to make it to 
the polls on Election Day, either because they were out of town or ill. But in 
the late 1970s, during the Administration of Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., legislation passed that enabled California's registered voters to use 
absentee ballots for any reason, including simple convenience. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, this legislation played a key role in a major election for the first 
time when Republican George Deukmejian defeated Democrat Tom Bradley in an 
extremely tight gubernatorial race. Bradley received the most votes among those 
who went to the polls on Election Day, but because Republican campaign 
strategists sent hundreds of thousands of absentee ballot applications to 
voters throughout the state, Deukmejian won the race. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, extensive use of absentee ballots figured sporadically in state 
elections, but it was not a major factor again until Condit's victory in the 
special congressional election in the San Joaquin Valley four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Condit's aggressive solicitation of absentee ballots was a strategy devised by 
San Francisco political consultant Clinton Reilly. Said John Whitehurst, 
Condit's campaign manager: "In special elections, the turnout is low and more 
Republicans than Democrats traditionally vote. . . . We were looking for a way 
to compete. We went after the absentee ballots as a way to get more Democrats 
to vote." 
</P>
<P>
Whitehurst added, "Because we had such a lead in the mail vote in the Condit 
campaign, I knew a week before Election Day that we'd won." 
</P>
<P>
In December, the absentee-ballot strategy again helped a Democrat. Former 
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea of San Diego lost among Election Day voters in a 
state Senate race, but because she locked up enough absentee votes, she won the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue received most of the attention in the campaign because Roman 
Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher barred Killea, a Catholic, from receiving 
Communion because of her pro-choice stand. But in terms of pure tactics, her 
pursuit of absentee voters was critical to her victory, political consultants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans learned from their two 1989 losses and vowed to fight for the 
absentee vote in future state elections, said James Dignan, vice chairman of 
the California Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that if we were going to be successful in the 1990s, we were going 
to have to improve our techniques in getting the absentee ballot," Dignan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 27th District race, Democratic candidate Sal Cannella criticized the 
state GOP for its use of temporary workers in collecting absentee ballots, 
calling the tactic "a desperate attempt . . . to try to buy this election." 
</P>
<P>
Dignan defended hiring temporary workers, saying they have been used in other 
political campaigns, and "they were well worth the money." 
</P>
<P>
After the primary election for the Assembly seat on Dec. 5, both Lang, the 
Republican, and Cannella began the campaign for the mail vote. They identified 
voters using computerized data banks and sent out absentee ballot applications 
to party members. The applications, which included campaign pitches from other 
politicians, were already filled out with the voter's name and address. All 
voters had to do was sign the application and mail it to receive their absentee 
ballot. The Republicans even provided free postage. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign staffs followed up with phone calls and door-to-door visits to 
ensure that the targeted voters sent in their applications and then their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"In a state where many people are commuting long distances, voting by mail is 
definitely the coming thing," said Barry Wyatt, chief of staff for Assemblyman 
Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos). "I commute to Sacramento every day and I'm up at 
6:30 in the morning and home at 8 at night, and it's darn hard to vote. 
Punching out the ballot at home, at my leisure, makes a lot more sense."

PILOT NEVER MADE CLEAR JET'S PLIGHT, CONTROLLERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air traffic controllers Monday defended their handling of an ill-fated 
Colombian jetliner, claiming that the pilot did not clearly communicate how 
critically low on fuel his aircraft was as it flew through delays and stormy 
weather toward New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The rebuttal followed allegations Sunday by the National Transportation Safety 
Board that the pilot told regional controllers he needed a "priority landing" 
and the message was not relayed to the radar facility responsible for guiding 
the plane to runways at JFK. 
</P>
<P>
The Avianca Boeing 707 en route from Bogota to New York plunged into a wooded 
hillside in the affluent community of Cove Neck alongside Long Island Sound on 
Thursday night, killing 73 of the 159 people on board. Investigators have 
determined all four engines were not operating and the aircraft apparently ran 
out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Avianca pilot never declared a 'fuel emergency' or a 'minimum fuel,' both 
of which would have triggered an emergency response by controllers," said R. 
Steve Bell, President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. 
"Tragically, the pilot said only he was low on fuel, which is a very common 
occurrence in bad weather and holding." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration also backed the controllers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the FAA in Washington, said when the Avianca pilot 
used the word "priority" in speaking with ground controllers, the word had "no 
particular meaning in air traffic control." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an emergency, you use the word 'emergency,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Transportation Safety Board refused to back down. 
</P>
<P>
An NTSB spokesman said the FAA version of events "is not a fair reflection of 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
"We're conducting this investigation, not the FAA," an NTSB official added. The 
FAA employs the nation's air traffic controllers, while the NTSB investigates 
transportation accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar cited portions of preliminary FAA transcripts of conversations between 
the pilot of the doomed airliner and New York approach controllers. 
</P>
<P>
After flying in three weather-related delays along the East Coast that added 89 
minutes of flying time, the crew of the jetliner radioed New York regional 
controllers at 8:45 p.m. that "we think we may need priority." 
</P>
<P>
"How long can you hold before you have to go to your alternate?" a regional 
controller asked. The alternate landing field for the jet was Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," the pilot replied, pausing and apparently checking with other 
crew members. "We can hold five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Farrar said that shortly afterwards, the co-pilot said the alternate site was 
"Boston. I can't make it." 
</P>
<P>
The FAA official said the regional controller then telephoned the center 
handling approaches to Kennedy. He said the regional controller said the 
Avianca plane had just emerged from a holding pattern "and can only do five 
more minutes of hold. Can you take him now?" 
</P>
<P>
"Slow him to 180 knots and I will take him," the local controller replied. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was forced to abort its landing at Kennedy 37 minutes later because 
it was descending too steeply. Minutes later it crashed into the hillside, 
apparently out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Bell of the controllers association said that after the pilot missed his first 
approach, "the controller working the aircraft described exactly to the pilot 
the pattern he intended to use to bring him back to Kennedy. The controller 
then asked the pilot if his condition allowed for that pattern. The answer was, 
'yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
"No one knew how perilous was this situation until it was far too late," Bell 
added. 
</P>
<P>
A key element in the conflict between the two federal agencies is what 
information was related in the phone conversation between controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Benson, a spokesman for the NTSB, said the phone message "may not fully 
reflect what went on." 
</P>
<P>
"There may be more to that conversation," he said. "It may need to be judged in 
a fuller context." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the NTSB said that in interviews it conducted at the Kennedy 
approach facility, none of the controllers involved with the Avianca flight 
recalled being told by regional controllers that the pilot had requested a 
priority landing. "That information should have been passed on," said Lee 
Dickinson, a member of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the federal agencies aside, other pilots and air safety 
experts said Monday that final responsibility in such situations always rests 
with the pilot, who should either clearly declare an emergency or seek an 
alternate landing field before fuel becomes critically low. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Roberts, an airline pilot and a safety expert with the Airline Pilots 
Assn., said that in the United States a pilot normally would not ask for a 
priority landing when low on fuel. The pilot would tell controllers: " 'I am in 
a minimum fuel situation'. It's a term that controllers understand," Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a pilot called in and asked for a priority landing, I'd ask him what his 
problem was," said Karl Grundmann, an air traffic controller and president of 
the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. at the Los Angeles Terminal Radar 
Approach Control facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Pilots are sometimes reluctant on the air to declare an emergency," Grundmann 
continued. "All sorts of people listen to those frequencies and they don't like 
everyone to get excited. They will use other words like: 'We'd like a priority 
landing.' 
</P>
<P>
"If he says he is running low on fuel, I have to find out how much and how much 
time he has. I would normally notify the supervisor. I would ask him (the 
pilot): 'Are you declaring an emergency?' 
</P>
<P>
"What it sounds like, there was a lack of communications, something that should 
never have happened," Grundmann said.

DEFENSE BUDGET SPARES KEY WEAPONS SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
PENTAGON: BUSH TAKES THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD SCALING BACK THE MILITARY. BUT 
LAWMAKERS PROMISE TO PURSUE EVEN DEEPER CUTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a defense spending blueprint that takes the first tentative steps toward a 
restructured military, President Bush on Monday proposed to cut troop levels, 
cancel numerous but relatively inexpensive weapons programs and close 55 mostly 
small military facilities, including 10 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration portrayed its $295-billion military budget as a 
painful transition to a new era of constrained defense spending, it spared 
virtually all of the military services' major weapons programs from the ax. Key 
members of Congress promised deeper cuts before the 1991 budget becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration proposed to go forward with two land-based nuclear missile 
programs, the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Trident ballistic missile submarine, the 
"Star Wars" space defense plan and numerous other costly long-term arms 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A new list of proposed base closings targeted Ft. Ord near Monterey, the Long 
Beach Naval Shipyard, Los Angeles Air Force Base (a small facility in El 
Segundo), El Centro Naval Air Facility as well as three Navy facilities in the 
San Francisco Bay area. California officials called the closures unwise and 
politically motivated and vowed to fight them. 
</P>
<P>
Another 45 military facilities in the United States and overseas -- most of 
them small posts and depots -- are slated for closure, and eight others will be 
scaled back, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that the defense budget responds to the 
diminishing military threat from the Soviet Union and reflects the intense 
competition with domestic programs for a share of the Administration's 
$1.23-trillion budget. 
</P>
<P>
He said that changes in Eastern Europe allow the first steps toward a much 
smaller military force than currently maintained. But he qualified that 
assessment with a warning that the nation should not contemplate a radical 
revision in basic military strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are opportunities out there now that will allow us to make some changes 
in our deployments, to reduce defense spending over the long haul," Cheney 
said. "But it has to be done carefully, it has to be done cautiously, it has to 
be done deliberately." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falls 2.6% Short 
</P>
<P>
The $295-billion budget, while somewhat greater than the $291.4 billion 
budgeted for the current year, falls 2.6% short of the amount the Pentagon 
would need to keep up with inflation. The share of federal spending devoted to 
defense, which peaked at about 27% in 1986, would slip back to 23.7% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's cautious spending plan disappointed critics in Congress and elsewhere, 
who had hoped for much deeper military spending cuts from the epochal changes 
in the Soviet Union and the seeming dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a delaying action," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget 
Project, an independent research organization in Washington. "It accomplishes 
cuts through some gimmicky, some legerdemain. . . . But there's no apparent 
link between a strategic rethinking and the changes in the 1991 budget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress Lies in Wait 
</P>
<P>
Anti-defense spending clamor is growing also on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers 
are readying their axes to cut well below the Administration's proposed 
spending targets and reap a much larger "peace dividend" from the apparent end 
of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney responded in a briefing for congressional leaders that "peace is the 
dividend." One lawmaker present at the briefing said that Cheney's remark was 
met by "snickering." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, said in a statement that he was not convinced that Cheney's plan 
adequately responded to the "dramatic and unprecedented changes in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that his committee would closely scrutinize the Administration's 
proposal to determine whether Cheney has provided justification for the 
continued costly deployment of 500,000 U.S. troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Pentagon budget includes proposals to dissolve two Army divisions and 
to retire two battleships, two nuclear cruisers, eight nuclear submarines and 
11 frigates. It also calls for deactivating 14 B-52 bombers and canceling 
guidance-system improvements to the Minuteman 2 nuclear missile, which may be 
scrapped as a result of negotiations with the Soviet Union anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney wants to continue to spend huge sums on major strategic weapons 
programs: $5.5 billion for the B-2 bomber, $4.5 billion for "Star Wars," $3.2 
billion for the Trident ballistic-missile submarine and $2.8 billion for basing 
to put the first of 50 MX missiles on rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that uniformed manpower would shrink by 38,000 men and 
women in 1991, to a total of 2,039,000. Slated to be disbanded are two Army 
divisions, the 9th Infantry Division, based at Ft. Lewis, and the 2nd Armored 
Division at Ft. Hood, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1991 budget, Cheney also presented a plan for 2% cuts in defense 
spending for each of the next four years, after adjustment for inflation. That 
would bring the cumulative reduction in Pentagon spending from 1986 to 1995 to 
22.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative defense budget for the four years from 1991 to 1994 is fully 
$167 billion smaller than the amount of spending that Bush projected in his 
military spending plan of last April. That plan envisioned growth of 1% or 2% a 
year throughout the period, after adjustment for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he expects that the savings can be achieved by successful 
completion of negotiations with Moscow on reducing conventional and strategic 
forces, by a new round of mutual arms cuts in Europe, by downsizing U.S. bases 
at home and overseas and by $39 billion in cost savings from Pentagon 
management reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The management reforms will mean reductions in force at dozens of military 
facilities. Edwards Air Force is slated to lose 417 slots and Norton Air Force 
Base, 75. Defense officials said they hope to achieve the reductions through 
attrition, not layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deep Cuts Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers predicted that the plan that emerges from Congress next fall will 
bear little relation to the Administration's request. Congress will cut $3 
billion to $10 billion from the Administration's request, congressional 
officials predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's blueprint calls for the closure of 43 U.S. military installations, 
many of them small storage or headquarters facilities, and 12 U.S. bases 
overseas, including RAF Greenham Common in Great Britain and Comiso Air Base in 
Italy, both of which house now-outlawed intermediate-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Another four U.S. bases, including Ft. Knox, Ky., and Ft. Lewis, Wash., were 
slated for major force reductions. Four additional bases nationwide will lose 
military and civilian slots to major realignments. 
</P>
<P>
In other major proposals, Cheney is seeking the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manpower. The armed forces' personnel rolls would shrink to the level of 
1980, just before the Ronald Reagan Administration defense buildup began. At 
the same time, military personnel would get a 3.5% pay raise in 1991, in line 
with Cheney's desire to retain quality troops and maintain morale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drugs. Military counter-narcotics efforts would get a boost of almost $300 
million to reach $1.2 billion, as the Pentagon launches new drug-fighting 
initiatives that would make greater use of Navy ships, Air Force aircraft and 
the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Star Wars". Cheney, who recently said the United States must "continue 
towards a deployable strategic defense system," proposes a $900-million 
increase in funding to a total of $4.5 billion for the controversial 
anti-missile plan. Research would continue on a range of space- and 
ground-based lasers while the Pentagon accelerated work on "Brilliant Pebbles" 
-- a swarm of small rockets in space to destroy incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Navy ships. The Navy proposed to retire two nuclear cruisers -- the 
Truxtun, based in San Diego, and the Bainbridge, based in Norfolk, Va. -- as 
well as the battleships New Jersey, based at the Long Beach Naval Station, and 
Iowa, at Norfolk, eight nuclear-powered attack submarines and 11 aging 
destroyers.

U.S. PROSECUTORS SMEARED MONTOYA, LAWYER TELLS JURY

<P>
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya is the target of a smear campaign by federal prosecutors 
who have relied on "certified crooks" and disloyal former aides to attack the 
senator, his attorney charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Michael Sands, giving his closing arguments in Montoya's 
corruption trial, attacked the credibility of half a dozen key prosecution 
witnesses. At one point he called Sen. Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba) "a sick old 
lady" who had difficulty remembering events of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a packed courtroom, Sands contended that the Whittier Democrat 
was the victim of a "setup" by undercover FBI agents and said Montoya never 
agreed to trade his vote for money. 
</P>
<P>
"Joseph Montoya is a human being," Sands told the jury. "As a human being, he 
has made mistakes. He has made several mistakes that have come out at this 
trial. But Joe Montoya has not committed a crime, and that's the important fact 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Atty. David Levi, in rebuttal, told the jury that Montoya was a 
powerful lawmaker who preyed on vulnerable individuals and who, when called to 
account for his actions, blamed those who testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's telling you everyone else is a liar or some kind of a nut," Levi said. 
"If you're on trial for extortion and bribery, a little perjury doesn't 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, 50, is on trial on 10 counts of extortion, racketeering and 
money-laundering stemming from a four-year federal undercover investigation 
into alleged corruption in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In his four-hour address to the jury, Sands put forth an explanation for 
Montoya's behavior in eight separate incidents in which the senator is accused 
of attempting to extort money from citizens who were seeking legislative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Montoya was misunderstood by individuals who wanted his vote, 
Sands told the jury. At other times, he was betrayed by disloyal aides who were 
acting on their own. But Montoya himself never solicited bribes or accepted 
payment in exchange for his vote, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Sands depicted Montoya as an advocate of ethical reform who contributed $20,000 
from his campaign account to Proposition 73, a campaign finance initiative 
approved by voters in 1988. Sands said that the total was more than Montoya 
received from all his alleged extortion attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer suggested that government prosecutors may have been 
motivated by racism in bringing Montoya to trial, citing the nickname "El 
Bandito" given to the senator by one lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another 'Smear' 
</P>
<P>
And Sands likened the government's case to a political campaign that has 
degenerated into a series of negative, personal attacks. Repeatedly, he 
referred to elements of the prosecution case as "just one more little smear." 
</P>
<P>
"The more dirt you can hurl, maybe something will stick," Sands told the jury. 
"The government has chosen to rely on . . . a mudslinging type of trial." 
</P>
<P>
Sands conceded that Montoya had erred in diverting $22,000 in campaign travel 
reimbursements to his own bank account for personal use. But the lawyer argued 
that the senator was simply paying himself back for earlier expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind that the method of reimbursement the senator 
used should never have been done," Sands said. "But that doesn't mean he wasn't 
entitled to the money." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said Montoya also was legally entitled to the $3,000 check he received 
from a federal undercover agent as part of the FBI's sting operation. Montoya 
was videotaped accepting the money from an agent who posed as a Southern 
businessman seeking help in passing legislation to aid his shrimp importing 
"company." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a setup," Sands told the jury. "They wanted to get photos of Joe 
Montoya coming to talk to them and taking their money. . . . At no time did 
Sen. Montoya agree to do anything other than go to the meeting and talk to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said Montoya did nothing to help win approval of the shrimp legislation. 
And he disputed the testimony of Vuich that Montoya tried to move passage of 
the bill during a meeting of the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee she 
chaired. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Vuich appeared to be a sick old lady," the attorney told the jury. "She 
had no memory of anything." 
</P>
<P>
In his rebuttal, Levi said Sands' characterization of Vuich, 63, was "quite 
cruel," and added: "She caught this man (Montoya) out in a blatant lie." 
</P>
<P>
Levi charged that Montoya did, in fact, take action to help the shrimp bill 
through the Legislature in exchange for his $3,000 payment. The fact that 
Montoya publicly disclosed his receipt of the money is irrelevant, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one said the defendant is stupid as well as corrupt," Levi said. "By 
reporting the money, he covers up the underlying bribery." 
</P>
<P>
Sands sought to undermine other key witnesses against Montoya by pointing to 
contradictory testimony and suggesting that they had motives for lying on the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
John Shahabian, a federal undercover informant, was a "certified crook" who 
himself had been caught in the FBI sting, Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Frick, a former staff member who testified that Montoya put a $5,000 
price tag on one bill, was a disloyal aide who was fired because she leaked 
information to the media, Sands contended. 
</P>
<P>
And Kathy Somerton, another former aide who testified that Montoya sought 
payments from several alleged victims, "was not telling you the truth," Sands 
told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But in his hourlong response, Levi defended Frick and Somerton, saying they 
were well-qualified staff members who had been driven from the Legislature by 
Montoya's "outrageous" practices. 
</P>
<P>
The case is scheduled to go to the jury today.

U.S. COURT SYSTEM AT BREAKING POINT, STUDY PANEL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's 200-year-old federal court system is at "a crisis point," 
according to a special committee of lawyers, judges, congressmen and U.S. 
senators, who have been examining the system for more than a year, a federal 
judge said here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S. District Judge Judith N. Keep of San Diego and her colleagues 
on the Federal Court Study Committee feel that sweeping changes in how the 
federal judiciary operates are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The group, created in 1988 by an act of Congress and appointed by U.S. Supreme 
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, is to present its recommendations to 
Congress in April. The panel, which issued a 138-page draft report in late 
December, is holding nine public hearings on the document around the country, 
including Monday's session at the U.S. Courthouse here. 
</P>
<P>
The basic thrust of the report is that the federal court system should be kept 
small and that the courts cannot solve all the nation's problems -- including 
illegal drugs and Social Security payment reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The report asserts that the federal courts' caseload has been growing 
dramatically without a corresponding increase in judges to handle the work. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Keep -- who presided at Monday's hearing -- said that, since 1945, 
the number of federal appeals filed by litigants has increased fifteen-fold, 
while the number of federal appeals court judges has only tripled. The report 
states that there is an urgent need for more judges at that level. 
</P>
<P>
Among 100 proposals in the report, the committee recommends: 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of a special federal tax court of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
* A judicial impact study of all new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
* Shifting a number of cases now in federal courts to state courts. 
</P>
<P>
* Delegating an administrative court, outside the federal judicial system, to 
handle such cases as determining whether an individual's Social Security 
benefits can be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
* Permitting the Justice Department to file only a limited number of 
drug-related cases in federal court -- namely those that cannot effectively be 
prosecuted at the state level because, for example, they involve interstate or 
international narcotics traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
There is sharp debate on virtually all of these proposals. For example, a 
number of critics have asserted that taking the Social Security cases out of 
the federal court system will make it more difficult for the less-fortunate to 
vindicate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
USC law professor Judith Resnik focused on the debate over Social Security 
cases Monday when she said the committee report, as a whole, could be read as 
an attempt to keep poor people out of the federal courts and reserve the system 
for big-business disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Keep emphatically denied that the committee had any such intention. 
</P>
<P>
The drug proposal also has attracted considerable interest. 
</P>
<P>
A number of federal judges have said they are being swamped with drug-related 
cases, making it more difficult for them to find time to try civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a sharp dissent, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis, who 
is in charge of the criminal division in Washington, wrote in the report: 
"Limiting federal participation in the war on drugs ignores the reality of 
present-day law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant -- and controversial -- proposals is one urging 
curtailment of lawsuits involving state law that are filed in federal court. 
Currently, such suits are filed when the parties in a case reside or are based 
in different states. 
</P>
<P>
Keep said those cases make up 25% of the load currently considered by federal 
judges and could include a routine "fender-bender" involving a driver who lives 
in California and another who lives in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is already under fire from trial lawyers and state court 
officials, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers have long maintained that so-called "diversity jurisdiction" is vital 
because federal judges, who are appointed for life, are less subject to 
political pressures in cases involving local litigants. 
</P>
<P>
That assertion was dismissed by the committee with little discussion in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
State court officials also oppose the proposal, complaining that they, too, are 
overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
Judith McConnell, presiding judge of the San Diego County Superior Court 
system, said such a change would add 800 cases a year to her courts' docket. 
And she emphasized that there are not enough courtrooms to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"We currently have a judge trying a case in the marshal's exercise room in El 
Cajon," she said, in an attempt to illustrate her point. 
</P>
<P>
One committee recommendation -- amending changes in federal sentencing laws 
that were enacted in recent years -- drew broad support from a diverse group of 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 has created havoc," said Raul Ramirez, who 
recently stepped down as a federal judge in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new guidelines have not achieved the act's goal of providing 
uniform sentences for the same offense. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William W. Schwarzer of San Francisco advocated the 
abolition of minimum mandatory sentences, saying they produced "gross 
disparities in sentencing because, in some cases, the quantity of drugs 
involved is all that determines the sentence."

<P>
Aure, who runs the establishment with relatives, said she never would have made 
the investment if she had known the air station might close. "If they close 
(the air station), I don't know what we would do," she said, her toddler 
granddaughter at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
News that U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's list of military facilities that 
may be closed across the nation included six naval installations in the San 
Francisco Bay Area raised fears of economic upheaval from Aure's lunch counter 
to the offices of local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials worried about the loss of blue collar jobs. And liberal Bay 
Area officials, who in the past have called for defense cuts, found themselves 
in the odd position of second-guessing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
If all the bases targeted by Cheney's plan are closed, California would be 
especially hard hit. The list includes Ft. Ord near Monterey, the Sacramento 
Army Depot, El Centro Naval Air Facility in San Diego County, the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard and the Los Angeles Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Within California, the Bay Area stands to lose the most. Aside from the Alameda 
Naval Air Station, other Bay Area facilities on Cheney's list are the Alameda 
Naval Aviation Depot, Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Oakland Naval Supply Center, 
Treasure Island Naval Station -- which sits in the bay between San Francisco 
and Oakland -- and Moffett Field Naval Air Station in Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy employs roughly 56,000 civilians and military personnel in the Bay 
Area. If all the Bay Area naval installations on Cheney's list were shut and 
the personnel relocated, the region would lose about 34,113 jobs. If the cuts 
come to pass, the Navy's only remaining presence in this major West Coast port 
would be at the Concord Naval Weapons Depot and Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 
where repairs are made to ships and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere would the effect of closures be more direct than in Alameda. Word that 
the Navy might leave came as Alameda officials laid plans to celebrate the 
50-year anniversary of the Navy's presence. Mayor Chuck Corica noted that 
Alameda, a city in the shadow of Oakland, sold 2,800 acres to the Navy for a 
dollar in 1937. Today, the city of 77,000 people revolves around the Alameda 
Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a terrible effect," Corica said. 
</P>
<P>
For many officials in this bastion of liberalism, the potential of closures 
presents a political problem. For example, Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) long 
has been a strident critic of military spending. But he also represents a 
district where many voters work for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be forced to be parochial," said Dellums aide Robert Brauer, 
raising the prospect that Dellums would oppose some of the reductions. "We 
would hope that (defense officials) didn't construct, from their point of view, 
a parochial plan." 
</P>
<P>
On the street in the Bay Area, rumors have come and gone that the bases might 
close. But with such talk now more than rumors, workers began considering their 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"You could find work, but the benefits and the working conditions wouldn't be 
the same," said Mike French, 38, a civilian mechanic at the Alameda Naval Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
His current health and pension benefits are so good that he would leave the 
area simply to keep a job with the government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson expressed concern that the possible closures would 
have a "substantial negative impact" on his city, which is still struggling to 
recover from the damage caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake. At the same time, 
other Oakland officials said they hoped the closures, if they occur, would 
spark a new era of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the earthquake, we can plan for the closures," said Oakland City 
Councilman Wilson Riles Jr. He said the busy port of Oakland could use the land 
now occupied by the naval supply depot for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense budget is boom or bust. It goes up or down based on politics. . . 
. We have to wean ourselves from such a dependence on defense budgets," Riles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Alameda County, the impact of the base closures "would be dissipated fairly 
quickly" because of the Bay Area's generally strong economy, predicted John 
Oliver Wilson, Bank of America's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
But the view that the Bay Area economy would hardly miss a beat is not shared 
by many officials. While the local economy booms for professionals, jobs that 
pay well and offer health benefits to laborers are disappearing. Alameda County 
Supervisor Don Perata said the loss of military bases could result in "a new 
class of underinsured" people. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a double whammy. You have reduced their earning power and made them a 
ward of the county," Perata said.

FOREIGN AID: THE PONTIFF BELIEVES THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD HAS A MORAL DUTY TO

<P>
In the keynote address of his African tour, Pope John Paul II appealed to the 
rich nations of the world Monday to provide more generous aid to the afflicted, 
have-not region of sub-Sahara Africa. 
</P>
<P>
On the fifth day of an eight-day trip through some of the poorest countries on 
Earth, the Pope's rhetoric was as powerful as his conviction that the wealthy 
nations of the Northern Hemisphere are not doing enough to counter Africa's 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
He was addressing aid workers and members of a foundation established in his 
name in 1984, principally through contributions by West German Catholics. It 
was the 10th anniversary of his first appeal here for aid to the Sahel, a 
region scourged by backwardness, drought and hunger in the relentless advance 
of the Sahara desert. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of justice," he said, "the Bishop of Rome, the successor of Peter, 
begs his brothers and sisters around the world not to scorn the hungry of this 
continent, not to deny them the universal right of human dignity and a secure 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"How would history judge a generation that, having all the means to feed the 
Earth's population, refuses to do so with fratricidal indifference? What peace 
could be hoped for by people who do not carry out the duty of solidarity? What 
a desert the world would be where misery is not met with life-giving love." 
</P>
<P>
The principal purpose of his visit to the Sahel, the Pope told reporters last 
week, was to remind the industrial world that the needs of Africa must be 
respected in the rush to aid the newly democratizing countries of East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And he said Monday: "Again, I must launch a solemn appeal to humanity in the 
name of humanity itself. The world must know that Africa suffers deep poverty. 
Available resources are declining, the Earth is becoming sparer across an 
immense area, malnutrition is chronic for tens of millions of people; too many 
children die. Is it possible that such a need is not felt by all humanity?" 
</P>
<P>
His new appeal, John Paul said, "is directed to the peoples of the world, 
especially to those of the North who have most of the human and economic 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
Like the other countries John Paul is visiting in the pilgrimage, Burkina Faso 
-- a landlocked, Colorado-size military dictatorship of 9 million people once 
known as Upper Volta -- is mired in the backwardness of subsistence agriculture 
that is hostage to nature's caprice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite public and private foreign assistance, Burkina Faso's standard of 
living has hardly improved since the Pope's visit in 1980. The country has 
enjoyed two successive years of good rainfall in regions where drought is more 
common, but per-capita income is still only about $200 a year. Last year, 
abundant rain brought voracious swarms of grasshoppers and locusts to devour 
the crops. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of singing, dancing people lined the dusty roads of this capital to 
greet the Pope on a day when the air was so heavy with Sahara sand that the 
airport runway lights were switched on at noon to guide the papal aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope also met President Blaise Compaore, an army captain who took power in 
a 1987 coup in which his predecessor, Thomas Sankara, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
West European countries provide the lion's share of economic assistance for 
Burkina Faso. The United States, eighth on the donor list, gave about $10 
million last year, supporting development projects and the government's family 
planning program. The Catholic Church opposes all such projects that promote 
artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
The John Paul II Foundation for the Sahel, headquartered here, serves eight 
countries and has distributed about $3 million in aid, but Western diplomats 
here say its work is little known outside church circles. 
</P>
<P>
Today John Paul flies to a provincial capital to conduct a Mass before 
continuing to Chad, the fifth and last stop of a pilgrimage that began in Cape 
Verde and continued through Guinea Bissau and Mali over the weekend.

USE OF FOOD-COSMETIC DYE RED NO. 3 CURBED BECAUSE OF CANCER FEARS

The Food and Drug Administration banned about one-fifth of the uses of the 
color additive Red No. 3 on Monday because it has been shown to cause cancer at 
high doses in laboratory rats. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said, Red No. 3 may no longer be 
used in any cosmetic product, including lipsticks, powders, blushes, shampoos, 
skin care lotions or bath oils. 
</P>
<P>
It is also excluded from use in cake frostings, cough drops, herbs and spices, 
flavorings, some processed fruits, chewing gum, cake mixes and dietary foods. 
Even the wax on cheeses may no longer contain the red dye, Corwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer risk is considered so small that the FDA said existing products that 
contain the color may be used. The ban on Red No. 3 will apply only to new 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA action prevents the use of the red dye in products where the color is 
mixed chemically with another additive. 
</P>
<P>
Direct addition of the dye to a product will continue, but the FDA announced 
its intention to halt this use eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Red No. 3 is one of seven primary colors approved for food, drug and cosmetic 
use.

CHILDREN'S DEATHS LIKELY TO FUEL DEBATE ON AIRCRAFT SAFETY SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths of four children and one infant in last Thursday's crash of Avianca 
Airlines Flight 52 in New York is expected to fuel the debate over child safety 
on airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration allows children under age 2 to sit on 
adults' laps and fly free, but safety experts contend that children who do so 
are not safe. 
</P>
<P>
Child safety advocates want the FAA to mandate the use of child safety seats on 
airliners, but it appears unlikely that the agency will do so. An FAA spokesman 
said Monday that the agency will propose a rule that will allow parents to use 
a safety seat on all flights by U.S. airlines if a ticket is purchased for the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not good enough," said Cheryl Kim, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
Area Child Passenger Safety Assn., which has petitioned the FAA for a tougher 
rule. "The FAA should require that all young children are buckled-up." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Lightfoot (R-Iowa) said he would seek legislation to mandate child 
restraints if the FAA does not require them. Since most airlines already allow 
use of the seats, "what the FAA is suggesting is little different from what we 
have now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Avianca Airlines, a Colombian carrier, said Monday that he did 
not know whether any of the seven infants aboard Flight 52 were riding in 
safety seats. He added that five infants who survived the crash remained 
hospitalized Monday, including one in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
That child, 9-month-old Daniela Andrea Montoya, suffered internal injuries when 
she flew from her father's arms and became wedged between two seats as the 
plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 707 crashed in Cove Neck, N.Y., as it approached John F. Kennedy 
International Airport, killing 73 of the 158 persons on board. 
</P>
<P>
Safety advocates contend that child restraints are needed on aircraft because 
the force of gravity builds in a crash, making an infant impossible to hold. 
The child safety issue arose after last July's crash of a United Airlines jet 
in Sioux City, Iowa, in which one infant died, along with 111 other people. 
</P>
<P>
Recent FAA crash tests show that safety seats can protect infants against 
injury. But the FAA has resisted a rule that would require use of the seats 
because the agency says some parents prefer to hold infants in their laps to 
save money. Moreover, the airline industry, which encourages voluntary use of 
safety seats, is concerned that a mandate would force airlines to provide the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
The industry also says that safety seats, designed for use in automobiles, are 
too bulky and clumsy for airline use. The industry has asked the FAA to help 
design a child restraint more suitable for airliners.

People who take the AIDS-treatment drug AZT before symptoms of the disease 
appear may be less likely to develop resistance to the drug than those who 
start AZT when they get sick, researchers from Burroughs Wellcome Co., the 
maker of the drug, told the Food and Drug Administration's newly formed 
Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee. The researchers said new studies indicate 
people who receive AZT before they become ill have far fewer drug-resistant 
strains of the AIDS virus than patients who start after signs of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome appear. AZT is the only government-approved drug to 
directly attack the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.

President Bush asked Congress on Monday to lay out more than $1 billion in the 
coming fiscal year to better understand and begin confronting the threat of 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives on climate change accounted for half of a $2-billion increase 
requested for environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush means business when he says he is an environmental President," 
said Environmental Protection Administrator William K. Reilly, whose agency 
stands to get a 12% increase to police the protection of the nation's air and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $237 million to begin developing giant new polar orbiting satellites for a 
15-year program designed to glean more accurate data on the oceans, clouds and 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $630 million for a new "America the Beautiful" program whose centerpiece 
will be an effort to plant a billion trees per year on private lands across the 
country, plus another 30 million along streets and in parks of the nation's 
communities. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a leading pollutant linked to global 
warming. In its first year, Bush is asking Congress for $175 million for the 
tree program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $200-million increase for continued cleanup of abandoned hazardous waste 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 24% increase -- to $460 million -- for protection of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establishment of $5,000 presidential awards to two teachers in each state 
who "design and implement the most innovative and effective programs to teach 
students about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Like Reilly, agency chiefs in charge of the programs enjoying elevated priority 
hailed the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is committed to creating a new environmental ethic in America." 
said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who has been frequently accused of 
siding with exploitation at the expense of environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists were not unanimously enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes up far short of what is needed to address the urgent national and 
international environmental problems that we face," Friends of the Earth Vice 
President Brent Blackwelder said of the environmental budget. 
</P>
<P>
"He proposes to spend $2 billion on new environmental programs, but at the same 
time he is cutting out $2 billion in important programs such as sewage 
treatment grants and energy efficient transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, found much to commend in the new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has turned the environmental ship around and now all we need to 
do is to get it moving at a sufficient rate of speed," said Paul C. Pritchard, 
president of the National Parks and Conservation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's budget on the environment shows a marked departure from nearly 
a decade of decline and destruction of America's environmental programs," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the tree planting program, the new budget proposes to reduce below-cost 
timber sales in 12 national forests. 
</P>
<P>
By asking Congress to provide the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
with $237 million for its new Earth Observation system, intended to study 
global warming, the Administration would make the space agency the government's 
biggest spender on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's proposal, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
would get an increase in its budget for research on global climate change -- 
from $18 million to $87 million. 
</P>
<P>
The President also recommended boosting the budget of the Council on 
Environmental Quality from $1.46 million to $2.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Council on Environmental Quality, an independent policy adviser to the 
President, was consigned to oblivion in the Ronald Reagan Administration. But 
Monday, it was recommended that its budget be, in effect, doubled for the 
second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Council Chairman Michael DeLand said nearly all of his budget increase will go 
into rebuilding his staff, enabling it to have input in nearly all 
Administration policy issues for the first time in years.

D.C. MAN IS EXPECTED TO TESTIFY THAT BARRY USED CRACK IN 1988

District of Columbia employee James L. McWilliams has reached an agreement with 
federal prosecutors and is expected to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor 
drug offense and tell a grand jury that he was present at the Ramada Inn when 
Mayor Marion Barry smoked crack cocaine, sources have told the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which could pave the way for perjury and other felony charges 
against the mayor, was concluded Monday at the office of U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Jay B. Stephens, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who was arrested on a drug charge Jan. 19, previously denied to a 
federal grand jury that he had used crack with Charles Lewis during visits to 
the Ramada Inn in December, 1988. The mayor's office declined to comment late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, 57, a former assistant attorney general of the Virgin Islands and 
longtime friend of Lewis, was present with Lewis and Barry at the Ramada the 
night of Dec. 19, 1988, and has long been considered a potentially crucial 
witness against Barry. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams is prepared to tell the grand jury that he was present in Lewis' 
hotel room when Barry arrived, and that he saw Barry and Lewis enter the 
bathroom together, according to sources. From the context of their 
conversation, McWilliams told prosecutors, it was clear that Barry and Lewis 
had entered the bathroom to smoke crack -- which McWilliams knew Lewis had 
obtained for the mayor's use. McWilliams said that he was watching TV while the 
two were smoking the drugs, the sources said.

EX-SECURITY GUARD GIVEN 8 YEARS FOR RECORD ARMORED-CAR ROBBERY

A former security guard was sentenced Monday to eight years in prison for 
masterminding the largest armored-car robbery in U.S. history. The court found 
that the man's son and a friend had been coerced into participating and 
sentenced them to shorter prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Jasinski, 52, of Boonton, told U.S. District Judge Garrett Brown Jr. 
that he expected no mercy for himself, but he asked for leniency for his son, 
William, 22, and William's friend from military school, Bryan Smals, 20, of 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The two younger men were sentenced to five years each. 
</P>
<P>
Jasinski worked as a guard for the Coin Depot Armored Car Co. He was arrested 
in January, 1989, about three weeks after two armed men in police uniforms got 
away with $4.5 million from a Coin Depot truck during a delivery to a bank in 
Clifton, N. J. 
</P>
<P>
A third accomplice, Ronald Stromp, is a locksmith with a criminal record who 
had been a friend of Jasinski for several years. He was not sentenced Monday 
because federal authorities failed to send him from prison to the courthouse. 
Stromp's sentencing was rescheduled for today.

'ROBIN HUD' ENTERS GUILTY PLEA IN THEFT

A woman dubbed "Robin HUD" for admitting that she stole millions of dollars 
from federal housing sales and saying she gave the money to the poor pleaded 
guilty Monday to federal theft and tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Louise Harrell, 46, a former real estate agent from Waldorf, Md., 
smiled throughout a hearing in U.S. District Court, where she pleaded guilty to 
charges that she stole money from the Housing and Urban Development Department 
and lied on her tax returns and to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd get caught a long time ago," Harrell said after the hearing. 
"I'm sorry for what I did. I figured I was history and would help as many as I 
could before I went down." 
</P>
<P>
Harrell had originally pleaded not guilty. But she said she chose a plea 
agreement after new tax evasion charges were added, and to avoid calling poor 
people to testify on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said Monday that she would prove at her April 20 sentencing that she 
stole only $4.75 million -- not the more than $6 million that prosecutors now 
say she took in what Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has called the largest theft of 
federal funds by an individual. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Harrell pleaded guilty to one count each of stealing 
government property and failing to report income for taxes. In return, 
prosecutors dropped two other tax counts, two counts of lying to HUD officials 
and one count of lying on a bank loan application. 
</P>
<P>
Though Harrell faces a maximum 13 years behind bars and $500,000 in fines, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gary Jordan said he will recommend a sentence of three to 
four years without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said after the hearing: "I'm not worried about prison. Some of the 
nicest people I know went to prison." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors alleged that Harrell, as a private escrow account agent for 
HUD, raked off the department's money from the sale of HUD properties. Less 
than $1 million has been recovered, and prosecutors said Harrell would not be 
able to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell contended in congressional testimony that nearly all the money went to 
help the poor. Prosecutors say she was her largest charity, although they 
acknowledge that she gave some money away. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said she hopes the public and the court will understand that she never 
bilked the poor, taking only from mismanaged HUD programs. "The program I 
diverted funds from was not a program that helped the poor. It was property 
disposition," Harrell testified. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters who said they had benefited from Harrell's largess attended the 
hearing. One held up a giant card, decorated with balloons, reading: "Marilyn, 
We're Remembering You." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Chepaitis, who said she runs a Baltimore homeless shelter, said 
Harrell helped provide incidentals for the facility, but declined to give 
details. "Jesus said to do your alms in secret, and that's just what Sister 
Marilyn did," Chepaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
"And like Jesus said, she cried out today for forgiveness. Now there are 
millions praying for her."

Darryl (Little D) Reed, 21, was convicted by a U.S. District Court jury of 
manufacturing and possessing with intent to distribute 28 pounds of crack, and 
of possessing with intent to distribute 15.4 pounds of powdered cocaine. Police 
estimated the drugs' street value at $3 million. Reed was sentenced here by

SENATE PASSES BILL TO CREATE AIRLINE CONSUMERS OFFICE 
</P>

<P>
The Senate, most of whose members are airborne commuters, passed with relish 
Monday a bill aimed at improving airlines' service in California by subjecting 
the companies to public and state government pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously don't give a damn about us up here," Republican Sen. Ed Davis 
said of passenger airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The Valencia lawmaker, usually an unflinching opponent of government 
intervention into the affairs of private industry, added his voice to others 
who have complained of higher air fares, shrinking schedules, long delays and 
abrupt cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
Davis charged that since federal deregulation of the airlines in 1978, service 
has steadily deteriorated to the point "where we can appropriately harass" 
airlines serving California. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sent to the Assembly on a 27-9 vote, would create a new airline 
consumer office at the state Public Utilities Commission. The office would have 
the power to investigate consumer complaints, scrutinize ticket price increases 
that appear to be excessive and publicize air fares. But the office would have 
no enforcement powers. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the bill's author, conceded 
that federal laws prohibit the state from taking tougher action such as 
regulatory steps he proposed a month ago. But he said that making the 
commission a public forum to vent complaints would put pressure on airlines to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report last month, the commission said that since deregulation 
12 years ago, air fares have soared in California 40% above the rate of 
inflation and demands for air service have doubled while the number of airlines 
has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
The undetermined cost of the new state office would be paid by a special tax on 
intrastate airlines whose gross income exceeds $25 million a year. Roberti said 
he believes the proposed tax could be levied by the state without violating 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was opposed by the Air Transportation Assn., a major industry trade 
organization, and by USAir. They contend that federal law preempts the state 
legislation and that consumers are already protected by the airlines and state 
and federal government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and Davis are among an estimated two dozen senators who regularly 
commute between their districts in Southern California and Sacramento at least 
once a week and sometimes more frequently. Currently, no state agency monitors 
airline fares or performance. 
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Air Transportation Assn. show that in 1980 it cost an 
average of $55 to fly from Los Angeles to Sacramento, a sum that rose to an 
average $97 in 1988, the last year for which its figures were available. The 
organization said that during the same period the average one-way cost from Los 
Angeles to Fresno increased from $35 to $91.

Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) declared Monday his candidacy for the Republican 
nomination for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, 52, filed a formal "declaration of intent" at the secretary of state's 
office and said he has raised $767,000 in campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour's expected opponent for the Republican nomination in the June primary 
is Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). She will file a formal campaign 
declaration this week, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, the Democratic incumbent, is expected to file for a 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
A former mayor of Anaheim, Seymour has served in the Senate since 1982. He was 
a real estate broker and property manager for 18 years before going into 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that California stands at the door to the 21st Century, facing 
social and economic challenges never before imagined," Seymour said.

BILL PRESS QUITS STATIONS TO FOCUS ON RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bill Press, under fire for months for allegedly using his KABC-TV and KABC 
radio broadcasts to build an unfair advantage for himself in the race for state 
insurance commissioner, delivered his last commentaries Monday before becoming 
an official candidate. 
</P>
<P>
And his pitch was highly political, prompting complaints from other 
contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it official," Press said on KABC-TV. "I have decided, beginning 
(Tuesday), to go for it. . . . This job really defines me. It really is a fight 
for the people day in and day out. That's what the job is all about. It 
combines that passion for public service I have with the passion of fighting 
for people." 
</P>
<P>
On KABC radio, he declared, "I'm convinced it's a job I want, taking on those 
big insurance companies and forcing them to make those cuts in auto insurance 
we voted for with Proposition 103. . . . This is the one job in state 
government that appeals to me, fighting for the people day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
Press had remained on the stations making commentaries -- including one last 
week critical of the job being done by the state Board of Equalization, chaired 
by Conway Collis, one of his leading opponents -- during months of exploratory 
efforts in the commissioner's race, including heavy fund raising, appearances 
at candidate forums and solicitations of endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Press's opponents, and some outside commentators, have raised questions about 
the propriety of his being allowed to remain on the air. Just last week Collis 
unsuccessfully asked for equal time to reply to Press. For the most part, 
station executives have avoided responding to the criticisms, and both stations 
said Monday their general managers were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in the last five years that a KABC-TV commentator has 
used the station's newscasts to declare his intention to run for political 
office. Press did it for the U.S. Senate in 1987, and Bruce Herschensohn for 
the U.S. Senate in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two of Press's Democratic opponents, Collis and former Common Cause 
director Walter Zelman, expressed unhappiness with Press and the stations. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that Bill should have been off the air a month or two ago," Zelman 
said. "He has been a candidate for months and I think the station and he should 
have recognized that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Collis: "While Bill Press has been misusing the public airways to promote 
himself, we've been fighting for California drivers. Ultimately, that is the 
basis upon which voters will choose a candidate. Commitment not commentary. 
Hard work, not TV talk." 
</P>
<P>
But Wes Bannister, a Republican candidate, said he did not mind Press's 
appearances. "I would prefer to see him on, because I think it's very helpful 
to have him exposing himself on a daily basis," Bannister said.

CHALLENGE TO PROP. 13'S CONSTITUTIONALITY FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit against the Los Angeles County assessor, challenging the 
constitutionality of Proposition 13's method of property taxation, was 
dismissed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David A. Workman ruled that the state Supreme 
Court had already decided the issue in 1978, when it found that Proposition 13 
does not discriminate against new property owners. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Carlson, attorney for Stephanie Nordlinger, a Baldwin Hills homeowner 
who filed the suit against Assessor John J. Lynch through the Center for Law in 
the Public Interest, said the ruling will be appealed to the 2nd District Court 
of Appeal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court upheld an equal protection challenge to Proposition 13 
just after it was enacted in 1978. But at that time, "extreme tax inequities 
had not yet developed," Carlson said, explaining why she will appeal Workman's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also noted that a recent U.S. Supreme Court property tax decision 
left the door open for such a suit from California to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
A new home buyer, Nordlinger contended that she is paying property taxes five 
times higher than her neighbors, who had purchased their homes, some much 
larger than hers, many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 set property taxes at 1% of assessed valuation and froze tax 
assessments for existing homeowners at 1975 levels. Once property is sold, it 
is reassessed and taxed on the basis of the new purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
Nordlinger, herself an attorney, enlisted the help of the Center for Law in the 
Public Interest, which in turn commissioned a study of the inequities created 
throughout the county by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The study by University of California economist David Gold found that new 
homeowners in neighborhoods throughout the county commonly pay 10 to 17 times 
the property taxes paid by their neighbors who have owned homes for many years. 
New owners of vacant lots in Los Angeles pay as much as 250 to 500 times the 
property taxes paid by longtime owners of comparable properties, the study 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Nordlinger's suit was filed after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 
January, 1989, a West Virginia county's "welcome stranger" method of taxing 
property -- so called because longtime property owners pay much less in 
property taxes than their new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the court held that the equal protection clause of the U.S. 
Constitution forbids taxing comparable property at widely disparate levels. 
</P>
<P>
There were two key factual distinctions between the West Virginia case and 
Proposition 13. Proposition 13 is imposed throughout California, while the West 
Virginia assessments were made only in Webster County. Proposition 13's 
measuring stick is purchase price while Webster County used current market 
value.

OAKLAND OFFICIALS: THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ROTHENBERG

Although admitting they don't know where Charles David Rothenberg is, Northern 
California politicians Monday speculated that the man who set his son afire was 
in Oakland, and at least two public officials vowed to seek the governor's help 
in having him transferred elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson told a throng of reporters Monday that, based on 
remarks by Oakland Police Chief George Hart, Wilson thinks that it is "likely" 
Rothenberg was paroled last week to that city. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Hart refused to answer the question directly but responded by 
referring Wilson to the state Department of Corrections, which is shepherding 
the parole of Rothenberg, who burned his son beyond recognition nearly seven 
years ago. He added that Hart said he "doesn't feel it's in his best interest 
to release that information." 
</P>
<P>
There has been no official confirmation as to Rothenberg's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
At the afternoon press conference in his Oakland office, Wilson joined other 
public officials expressing outrage that Rothenberg may be in Alameda County. 
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors today is expected to file official 
protests with Gov. George Deukmejian, seeking Rothenberg's transfer from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don Perata said he will ask that Rothenberg, 49, be held on the San 
Quentin prison grounds for the rest of his three-year parole. This is where 
California's other notorious parolee, Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a 
teen-ager and axing off her forearms, was held after residents angered by his 
release drove him from Northern California towns. 
</P>
<P>
"I have formally appealed to him in a letter this afternoon," Perata, chairman 
of the board, said. "I have asked the governor to overturn the decision by the 
Department of Corrections which apparently is (that) they have or will parole 
Charles Rothenberg to this county. I asked him to intervene . . . and I cited 
the precedent set in the Larry Singleton case a few years back where public 
protest and concern led the governor to remand Singleton to place him on the 
campus of San Quentin" prison. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get the communication, we will respond," said Robert Gore, the 
governor's press secretary. "The parole of Rothenberg has been very uneventful 
so far. I mean, he's just disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg doused his son, David, 6, with kerosene in a Buena Park motel room 
March 3, 1983, and set him on fire. He had taken his son from New York, and 
when he phoned his wife to tell her, she threatened to prevent Rothenberg from 
ever seeing his son again. He was arrested a week after the fire and confessed 
to trying to kill his son because, "If I couldn't have him, nobody could." 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 13 years for the attempted murder, arson and other crimes 
connected to the fire. State law allowed him to serve only half the sentence 
for work he did behind bars. Rothenberg was released Wednesday from an 
undisclosed prison amid the tightest security of any parolee in California. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage over Rothenberg's release prompted prison officials to keep his 
parole destination a secret. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections spokesman Tipton C. Kindel refused to comment on Rothenberg's 
whereabouts but said Monday that the arsonist is aware of the "revulsion by the 
public" and fears for his life. 
</P>
<P>
One source said Rothenberg is wearing a bulletproof vest. He has had no contact 
with anyone beside the four parole agents who take shifts guarding him, Kindel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that if Rothenberg was paroled to Oakland, he should not have been. 
He said the parolee belongs in a smaller community where he can be supervised 
more closely. The Oakland City Council is expected to draft a resolution 
tonight protesting Rothenberg's parole to their city. 
</P>
<P>
A vigilante atmosphere has developed in the East San Francisco Bay Area as the 
media cover the daily developments on Rothenberg, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out there and it's been out there for a few days now," he said. "People 
are going to have their fears." 
</P>
<P>
But Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer disagrees. Plummer, who wold not 
comment on whether Rothenberg was in his county of 1.3 million people, said he 
has not received any calls from residents regarding Rothenberg, only "from 
politicians and reporters."

<P>
LIBRARY SITE PANEL TO BE NAMED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A committee will be taking shape soon to consider possible sites for a new main 
library in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The current library, on Chapman Avenue between Center and Shaffer streets, was 
built in 1960 when there were 22 library staff members and a city population of 
26,000, library director Karen Leo said. 
</P>
<P>
With 50 staff members and a population of more than 107,000, the present 
22,140-square-foot building is considered inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant hired by the city recommended two locations for the new library, 
but residents at a public hearing last week criticized both sites. 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposals is to raze the present library and rebuild on the current 
site, but this would require either building a smaller library than recommended 
by a consultant or buying about 10 homes to the north of the library for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Buying the homes, in a section of Old Town, is unacceptable to many, City 
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz has said. 
</P>
<P>
Building at the other site recommended by the consultant, the corner of East 
Chapman Avenue and Yorba Street, was unacceptable to some because it is a 
former dump, Leo said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don E. Smith suggested another location, the County Fire Department 
headquarters on East Chapman Avenue at Water Street. Smith said the county may 
move to another location. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, the five library board trustees and five residents to be 
appointed by the City Council, will consider these and other possible locations 
for a new library and will report back to the council at a study session 
scheduled for March 27, Leo said. SHANNON SANDS

TUSTIN HIGH TO SEND 3 MORE TO WESTPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since their freshman year, Erin Cunningham, Jennifer MacLean and Dan Taylor 
have shared most of the same honors classes at Tustin High School. In July, 
they will share the same classes once again -- but this time at the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
The three, chosen this year to attend the prestigious academy in New York, 
bring to nine the number of students from Tustin High appointed to West Point 
since 1983 -- more than any other high school in the country, according to 
Tustin school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We really feel it's because of the strong background we give the kids in 
academics the moment they walk through the door," said Brad Lantz, assistant 
vice principal. "We have a great counseling service that works directly with 
college-bound students." 
</P>
<P>
For Cunningham, MacLean and Taylor, having older friends at West Point is 
comforting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing," said Taylor, a 17-year-old varsity basketball player. "We 
know some of the people from Tustin that are there now, and they've given us a 
lot of information about what the school is like." 
</P>
<P>
To get appointments to the academy, the students had to ask their local 
congressman, Rep. C. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach, for a nomination. All 
applicants must have the recommendation of a federal or state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must also meet the grade and test requirements and must be 
athletically oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to participate in some sort of sport," said Cunningham, 17, a member 
of the cross-country and track team. "Since it is required that you participate 
in a sport at the academy, it makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Students also participate in a six-week boot camp before classes begin. 
</P>
<P>
The students all said that after they applied, they had considerable doubts 
about faring well enough to be accepted by the academy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out I got in, I was at my after-school job at a florist," said 
MacLean, 17, who wants to study medicine. "I was so excited. . . . Everyone 
gathered around because they knew how much anticipation I'd had over it." 
</P>
<P>
As West Point cadets, each will receive about $500 a month, but most of that 
income will be spent on uniforms, computers and books. After graduation, five 
years of service must be completed in the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
"They say life as a 'plebe' (freshman) is really something else," said 
Cunningham, who plans to fly helicopters after graduation. "You have no respect 
and get to deliver everyone else's mail." 
</P>
<P>
"The officials have been pretty straight with us about what to expect and how 
things are," Taylor said. "They say to be mentally prepared. For me, mental 
preparation just involves expecting the worst." ALLISON SAMUELS

SUPPORT FOR FAMILY PLANNING BILL URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder urged support of a state bill Monday that 
would restore most of a recent, $24-million cut in state assistance to family 
planning centers. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder told a crowd of about 100 people at Leisure World that "you are going to 
be missionaries" to help pass AB 99, an effort to restore $20 million to the 
family planning budget. 
</P>
<P>
"You are going to be the squeaky wheel that gets the attention of legislators." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget unveiled Jan. 10 would slice more than 
$1 billion in services to the poor. In Orange County, the family planning 
budget dropped from $500,000 to about $86,000 with the cuts, Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is looking at what the loss incurred by these cuts will be in the long 
run," she said, adding that the budget reductions "could create $190 million in 
additional costs." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Bill 99 was written by 31st District Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan 
(D-Fresno).

FIRE ERUPTS IN EMPTY CLASSROOM

<P>
Authorities evacuated students of the Travis Ranch Middle School in Yorba Linda 
on Monday when a fire broke out in an empty classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was quickly extinguished by the school's sprinkler system even before 
firefighters arrived. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said the fire began about 11:15 
a.m. in a home economics classroom in the building in the 5200 block of Via de 
la Escuela. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained in an area near a kitchen stove, leading investigators 
to believe that the stove was left on, she said.

MARCH START SEEN FOR SHERIFF'S DNA LAB; 
</P>
<P>
FORENSICS: TESTING OF DNA EVIDENCE FOR COURT USE IS PROJECTED TO BEGIN ABOUT 
FOUR MONTHS LATER THAN SOME COUNTY SUPERVISORS EXPECTED. 
</P>

<P>
A DNA laboratory approved by the Board of Supervisors last fall should be ready 
in March to test samples for use as evidence in court, Sheriff's Department 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That is about four months later than the December start-up date that 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates gave the supervisors when he asked them in October 
to fund the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"I very definitely recall that," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "We were 
given an estimated date of completion . . . and now it looks like the original 
estimate was off." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was furious with other board members when 
they voted to delay a decision on the laboratory by a month -- later shortened 
to two weeks -- took the delay in stride this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to rush it through, and it turned out not to be possible," 
Wieder said. "The important thing is that it's going to happen . . . and 
whenever it gets here it'll be about time." 
</P>
<P>
When the facility opens, Orange County will have the first crime laboratory in 
California capable of taking tiny samples of blood, hair or semen and breaking 
them down into cell fragments that contain deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which 
carries the genetic code unique to each individual. 
</P>
<P>
DNA evidence -- processed by an outside laboratory -- was admitted in an Orange 
County trial for the first time earlier this month. The rape suspect in the 
case pleaded guilty three days after the evidence was ruled admissible. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department had been requesting a DNA testing laboratory for at 
least two years, but its need was seen as acute last fall after a 12-year-old 
girl was raped in a gated community in Huntington Beach, just blocks from 
Wieder's home in the same development. The suspect arrested in that case had 
been acquitted earlier of another rape charge, after prosecutors were late in 
receiving DNA evidence from an outside lab. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was unavailable for comment Monday, but Lt. Richard J. Olson, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman, said the laboratory is on schedule and is conducting 
proficiency tests to ensure that it yields accurate results. The lab is in a 
building next to the Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"The original statements (projecting a December or January start-up) were about 
testing," Olson said. "We're finishing up the first set now." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fitzpatrick, Sheriff's Department forensic science services director, 
agreed that the lab has moved along as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real happy about how quickly it's been moving," Fitzpatrick said. "We have 
to do the testing, and get all our policies, procedures and manuals in place. . 
. . We have to show we can do the work competently . . . before the evidence is 
admissible in court." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick explained that the four criminalists assigned to the DNA lab must 
perform several batches of tests on DNA samples purchased from other labs -- 
without incorrectly matching a single set of samples -- before they can testify 
as expert witnesses in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The accuracy rate (that officials want) is 100%," Fitzpatrick said. "If there 
is an incorrect result, we shut down the program and go back and look at it 
from the beginning."

DEFENSE RESTS IN TRIAL OF REPUTED MOB BOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The defense lawyer for Michael Anthony Rizzitello rested his case Monday 
without calling the reputed mobster to testify on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello, 62, an alleged underboss in the Milano crime family in Los Angeles, 
is charged with attempted murder in the April 30, 1987, shooting of William 
Carroll, the Mustang Club financier blinded when three bullets were fired into 
the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier left court without commenting on why 
Rizzitello did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has testified that Rizzitello shot him and that Joey Grosso, who ran 
errands for the Mustang topless bar, held his leg so he could not get away. 
Grosso, 46, has already been convicted and is serving 27 years to life for his 
role in Carroll's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello shot Carroll because he believed the 
financier would not agree to cut Rizzitello in on the club's profits. He 
allegedly wanted Carroll out of the way so he could pressure the Mustang's 
manager to share the club's profits. Mustang manager Gene Lesher has testified 
that this was exactly what Rizzitello did. And Lesher said he gave in to 
Rizzitello out of fear that he would end up like Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials believe that if Rizzitello had testified, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher J. Evans probably could have gained permission to tell the jury of 
Rizzitello's conviction in a 1980 racketeering case. In that case, Rizzitello 
and four others were convicted of making threats of violence in order to extort 
money from pornography dealers -- the same thing prosecutors say happened at 
the Mustang Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Rizzitello could not afford for jurors to see how similar they were," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Without Rizzitello's testimony, the best witness for the defense, so far, has 
turned out to be someone who has not testified in the trial -- Grosso. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier has presented to jurors, through other sources, statements made by 
Grosso before his trial that a bouncer at the club, George Yudzevich, was the 
actual killer, and that Rizzitello was not present. Yudzevich was murdered a 
year after the Carroll shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso recanted that statement when he testified at his own trial, and instead 
identified Rizzitello as having shot Carroll. Grosso told jurors that he had 
made the statement about Yudzevich because Rizzitello had threatened to kill 
him if he implicated him in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But Rizzitello's jurors have yet to learn that Grosso identified Rizzitello as 
Carroll's assailant. Evans is expected to make that clear to jurors when his 
rebuttal begins today. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains whether prosecutors will now put Grosso on the witness 
stand. Grosso has been brought to Orange County Jail from prison in Chino to be 
ready in case Evans calls him.

AIRPORT MONORAIL WORK TO BE LATE IN STARTING 
</P>

<P>
Construction of a long-awaited, half-mile airport monorail probably will begin 
several months behind schedule in July and will have to be retrofitted to the 
new John Wayne Airport passenger terminal, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week airport officials complained that they had not heard for three months 
from McDonnell Douglas Realty Co., which has agreed to pay for the $4-million 
monorail, as the airport construction progressed. Now, the monorail will be 
more difficult to align with the nearly completed airport complex. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, in whose district the airport is located, said that 
he met Monday in his office with representatives of McDonnell Douglas, the 
airport, his staff, and the Transportation Group Inc., the firm that will build 
the monorail, in an effort to resolve the communication problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still very committed to the project," said Riley, referring to 
McDonnell Douglas and TGI. "But they realize that the effort -- as far as the 
construction in the airport is concerned -- will be more expensive due to 
retrofitting. They missed some opportunities to have it included in the current 
terminal project." 
</P>
<P>
Riley added, however, that he "made a commitment. . . . We left here with the 
fact that would try to facilitate the project as much as possible, even though 
there may be some problems in getting the alignments right." 
</P>
<P>
"I think this project might very well be the motivating force for (a monorail 
system) to swing through the whole county," Riley said. "We left with the idea, 
from my point of view, that we want the project to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Six Orange County cities have banded together to propose a central county 
monorail system linking Irvine, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, Orange 
and Anaheim. They hope to have the project financed by private developers. 
</P>
<P>
The airport monorail would link the new passenger terminal with twin, 23-story 
office towers planned by McDonnell Douglas Realty but which have not received 
final approvals from Irvine city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Badeau, TGI's project development director, said Monday that the 
monorail alignment issue is not really a problem. "We've always had two 
alternate alignments, and we still do," he said. "We will have to retrofit, but 
there are many ways to do it. Once the McDonnell Douglas project gets through 
its final reviews, we will start the monorail construction in mid-1990." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if some recently completed portions of the $310-million airport expansion 
project would have to be torn up to accommodate the monorail now, Riley said: 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in that mode yet."

"I think everybody thinks Fullerton is going down," said Mate Borgogno, the 
Titans' second baseman. "Just one bad year and everyone thinks the program is 
going down. I feel we're going to change it around." 
</P>
<P>
The players scan the preseason polls, down the list and back up. Down again, 
more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton isn't there, not in Baseball America, not in The Sporting News, 
not in Sport magazine. No poll named the Titans among its top 25 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Only one chose them at all, Collegiate Baseball, which ranked them 31st. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have won two national championships, both under Augie Garrido, who 
led them to titles in 1979 and 1984 before leaving to become coach at Illinois 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have been to the College World Series five times since 1975, four 
times under Garrido, and once under Larry Cochell, who was named national coach 
of the year by Collegiate Baseball for guiding Fullerton to third place in 
1987, his first season. 
</P>
<P>
And the Titans have had a place in the top 25 as regularly as the sun shines on 
Titan Field. Fullerton officials can't recall a time since 1975 that the team 
wasn't ranked in the preseason. But now the Titans, who struggled to a 30-27 
record last season, their worst in 15 years, are not ranked. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, that might pass for an off-year, a blip on the landscape of the 
program. But with Cochell entering his third season at Fullerton and Garrido 
moving into his own at Illinois, some believe it might be a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
If Garrido were still coach, more people might allow last season to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a great year," pitcher Huck Flener said. "A lot of years Augie 
didn't go to the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans struggled last year after losing pitcher Mark Beck to shoulder 
surgery before the season and playing without catcher Brent Mayne, who was kept 
out for weeks by injury and illness. They endured a defense so unsteady that it 
committed 125 errors. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Cochell, 49, faces a period of judgment. There were those who claimed 
that the team that went to the World Series two years ago was really Augie's 
team, a team Garrido had built. Last year's team was a mixture of old and new 
players. This team, though, is Cochell's team. Only four players -- pitchers 
Flener, Rich Faulks and Matt Watson and infielder Mark Shimamoto -- were at 
Fullerton when Garrido was coach. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge will come quickly. After opening the season against Cal Poly 
Pomona at 1 p.m. today at Titan Field, Fullerton plays three-game series 
against traditional powers Arizona and Stanford on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a good thing," Cochell said. "We'll find out exactly where we are." 
</P>
<P>
As if this season did not have enough of a Larry-versus-Augie air to it 
already, the two will meet head-to-head March 22, when Illinois plays Fullerton 
at Titan Field for the first time since Garrido left. 
</P>
<P>
"Just another game," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for Flener, the left-handed pitcher who had a 9-1 record for Fullerton 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"To those of us who were recruited by Augie and then he left, it will be more 
than just a game," Flener said. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a game that will provide one more chance for comparison of two 
coaches who are essentially incomparable. No one has put it better than Keith 
Kaub, the power-hitting first baseman who played under both. 
</P>
<P>
"Augie's like lobster," Kaub said in 1988. "Cochell is like a home-cooked 
meal." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't stop the comparisons. Borgogno hears them again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'You know, he's doing a good job. Look at Illinois,' " Borgogno 
said. "But that's something that doesn't concern me, Cochell or the team. 
(Garrido) is doing a good job and he's a great coach. But that's something 
that's in the past, at least with Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
The season ahead is what the Titans are concerned with, not the polls, Cochell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't deserve to be up there right now," he said. "I think we're going to 
be pretty good. We have a chance to be outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
With an improved defense and a deep pitching staff, Cochell said the Titans are 
potentially a top 10 team. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching staff, coached by former major league player Vern Ruhle, will be 
led by Flener and top reliever Chris Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a guy who can dominate a game like Beck, but we have eight or 
more who can do the job for us," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno is the only player who returns in the infield, which will be 
strengthened with the addition of community college transfer Steve Sisco at 
first, USC transfer Kevin Farlow at shortstop and freshman Phil Nevin at third. 
Matt Hattabaugh, another community college transfer, will be the starting 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if I can look back after this season and say this is one 
of the best defensive infields I've had in 24 years," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Borgogno, outfielder Rich Gonzales is the only returning postion 
player. Domingo Mota, a community college transfer who is the son of Manny 
Mota, will likely play center field. Right field is still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our question mark is how we're going to score runs," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans won't have the type of power they had last season in Dave Staton, 
who hit 18 home runs. They do, however, have Borgogno, who batted .359 with no 
homers. And Sisco, Nevin and Hattabaugh could provide power. 
</P>
<P>
"The proof will be in the pudding," Cochell said. "It doesn't matter what I say 
or what anybody says. At the end of the year, people can evaluate."

Tom Anthony, principal at Capistrano Valley High School, gave four-day 
suspensions to two students on Monday for their involvement in a brawl during 
the Cougars' basketball game at Mission Viejo High School Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said Capistrano Valley parents and students identified the students. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not reveal the students' names. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony suspended the students for joining a fight between players in the 
fourth quarter of the Cougars' 77-63 victory over Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
No players were suspended, Anthony said. Mission Viejo's Eric Cramer and 
Capistano Valley's Brett McCorkle were ejected from the game after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Another Capistrano Valley student was suspended from attending on-campus 
activities for the rest of the school year because of the fight, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said he's considering suspending another Capistrano Valley student who 
was involved in a fight behind the scorer's table. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Metz, Mission Viejo principal, was on jury duty Monday and unavailable for 
comment.

KENNEDY'S MAYBERRY GETS 200TH VICTORY

<P>
With Kennedy High School's 82-55 Garden Grove League triumph over La Quinta 
Monday night, Coach John Mayberry recorded his 200th career victory. And to 
mark the occasion, students at the school raised banners and balloons and 
presented Mayberry with a cake. 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry raised his coaching record to 200-110 in the midst of his 13th season 
with another routine victory. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 24th year of teaching at Kennedy, Mayberry is the only coach to win 
a Southern Section basketball title in the history of Anaheim Union High School 
District. Kennedy won the boys' 3-A division title in 1987-88 with overtime 
victories in the semifinals and championship game. 
</P>
<P>
All along, through a 1-19 season in 1982 and the title year in 1988, Mayberry 
has worn the school colors of the Fighting Irish, a trademark green suit with a 
yellow sweater. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some emotional moments for Kennedy, for instance, when he 
became teary-eyed in the run to the championship two years ago. That mood 
resurfaced Monday night when the school's cheerleaders presented him with a 
cake that read: "200th Win, Congratulations Coach." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got that feeling all over again," said Mayberry, as he stood beneath a 
bridge of green and white balloons fighting back the tears. "I tried to keep 
this quiet, but I guess I'm not very good at keeping a secret. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a special night for myself and the team. The kids are playing with 
such intensity now, it's been a joy to coach them. We've had great practices 
and we're all working hard for a shot at another title." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (12-6, 9-1) has nine consecutive victories since losing its league 
opener to Rancho Alamitos. Forwards Jim Barker and Billy Williams sparked 
Kennedy Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had 20 points and 17 rebounds. Barker added 25 points, but saw his 
consecutive free-throw streak end at 39 when he missed his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
While Kennedy celebrated, a nightmare season continued for La Quinta. The 
Aztecs played well in the first quarter, then self-destructed in the second and 
third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy held a 63-36 lead after three quarters and it was only a matter of time 
before La Quinta lost its 18th consecutive game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In other Garden Grove League games: 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica 81, Los Amigos 47 -- Host Pacifica began the game with a 12-2 run and 
had five players score in double figures. Tim Whalen and Kevin Gaughen each 
scored 13 for Pacifica (10-8, 8-2). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 82, Santiago 63 -- David Green scored 20 points and Richard 
Pearce and Tony Cortez each added 16 for host Rancho Alamitos (15-4, 9-1). 
Jamal Nuristani scored 21 to lead Santiago (6-12, 2-8). 
</P>
<P>
In the Freeway League: 
</P>
<P>
Sonora 77, Buena Park 71 (OT) -- Sonora's Anthony Choe made a three-point shot 
with 20 seconds left in regulation to send the game at Buena Park into 
overtime. Scott Oxarart, who had 16 points and 18 rebounds, made four of four 
free throws in overtime for Sonora (6-14, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Choe led all scorers with 25 points. Ray Lanier had 18 points for Buena Park 
(8-11, 3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 84, Troy 83 -- Ladd Brunner made a three-point shot at the buzzer for 
host Fullerton. With eight seconds remaining, Troy's Chris Inman missed the 
front end of a one-and-one. Fullerton's Jason Black got the last of his 11 
rebounds and passed it to Rene Arias. Arias threw a 40-foot bounce pass to 
Brunner, who made the shot that put Fullerton (8-11, 5-1) ahead for the first 
time in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Arias led all scorers with 32 points, including 22 in the second half and 14 in 
the fourth quarter. Richard Wesley had 22 points and Mike Abbott had 19 to lead 
Troy (8-12, 2-4). 
</P>
<P>
In the Academy League: 
</P>
<P>
St. Michael's 62, Newport Christian 61 -- Trailing 35-19 at halftime, visiting 
Newport Christian rallied to within a point with about 20 seconds remaining. 
Jocques Wright scored 30 points for St. Michael's (5-1).

LANDMARK SET TO BUY BANK OF ORANGE COUNTY ; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: THE DEAL, SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TARGET 
BANK, WOULD GIVE LANDMARK A KEY BRANCH IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY.

<P>
Landmark Bancorp said Monday it is close to agreement on terms for the 
acquisition of Bank of Orange County in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But no firm price has been set, and the purchase is subject to resolution of a 
lawsuit pending in San Jose against Bank of Orange County and some of its 
current and former directors. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Collette, Landmark's president, said he believes that the suit -- brought 
by federal regulators acting as receiver for the failed Bank of Northern 
California -- should be resolved in three to six months, clearing the way for 
the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Orange County is involved in the suit because its holding company, 
Orange Bancorp, was a major shareholder in Bank of Northern California and its 
former president, Lawrence Holmes, was a co-founder of the San Jose bank. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Pratt, Bank of Orange County's president since early 1988, said 
settlement talks with federal regulators are stepping up as an April trial date 
for a $53-million negligence suit approaches. He said any settlement figure 
should be "manageable" and should not significantly hurt his bank, which has 
regained financial stability after several troubled years. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said he and Collette are longtime friends who have developed similar 
business plans. He said his bank would be "an excellent addition" to Landmark's 
operations. Landmark was the highest of five bidders who recently sought to 
acquire the small Bank of Orange County, Pratt said. He wouldn't say what that 
bid was. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition would give Landmark -- holding company for Landmark Bank -- a 
strategic branch in an area where it has been picking up a number of business 
customers. Landmark also would try to keep the doctors and other medical 
professionals who currently bank with the Bank of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said key people at his bank already have been offered jobs in the merged 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
A consolidation would create one of the county's larger banks, with nearly $208 
million in assets, based on results from the banks at the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark, with offices in La Habra, Anaheim, Lake Forest and Santa Fe Springs, 
had $173 million in assets at the end of the year. Neither bank has yet 
released earnings for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old Bank of Orange County, a money-losing operation through most of 
the 1980s, earned $210,000 through the first nine months last year. It has 
turned in modest profits in recent years and has wiped out the problem loans it 
had in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark, an 11-year-old bank, earned more than $1.4 million in the first three 
quarters of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Orange County, once touted as a model for aggressive independent banks 
in California, began losing money in 1984, a year after Holmes, its founding 
president, tried to expand by investing heavily through Orange Bancorp in Bank 
of Northern California. Orange Bancorp owned 51% of the San Jose bank, which 
Holmes co-founded with a group of Northern California investors. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1984, Holmes abruptly resigned his $300,000-a-year post and left the 
area, defaulting on $275,000 in personal loans that he had obtained from three 
other area banks. Shortly after his May departure, Orange Bancorp reported a 
$1.4-million loss for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1985, with Holmes gone and losses mounting at both banks, Orange 
Bancorp sold its interest in Bank of Northern California to a group of Santa 
Rosa investors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Bank of Northern California was declared insolvent and seized by 
regulators. A suit filed by the bank and its minority shareholders alleges that 
the investors who bought Orange Bancorp's controlling block of shares ran Bank 
of Northern California into the ground with bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was cited in mid-1987 by the holding company for Pacific National 
Bank as a reason that it was withdrawing its offer to acquire Bank of Orange 
County.

Marketing Agreement: Despite the troubles it has experienced over the past 
several years, IBM still can give a big lift to small companies. Network 
Software Associates of Laguna Hills, which specializes in designing software 
for the complex computer networks used by IBM's biggest customers, has signed a 
marketing agreement with Big Blue that it hopes will boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
Network Software already works closely with IBM, as it must to sell the 
specialized networks that allow IBM personal computers and terminals to "talk" 
with larger minicomputers and huge mainframes. And the 10-year-old, privately 
held firm has made a good business of it, building up to a staff of 50. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the company will be an official "industrial application remarketer" for 
certain IBM products. And though the agreement won't have a huge impact on the 
way the firm does business, "having the IBM logo next to yours ensures an image 
of strength in the customer's mind," a company spokeswoman said. Compiled by

FORD AEROSPACE OFFICIALS WORK ON MANAGEMENT-LED, LEVERAGED BUYOUT

<P>
Ford Motor Co.'s efforts to sell its Ford Aerospace subsidiary haven't yielded 
concrete results yet, but several executives of the Newport Beach-based company 
are working on a management-led leveraged buyout, a company spokeswoman 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be learned exactly who was involved, but sources say that the 
group will find it difficult to raise money for such a buyout in the current 
economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the so-called junk bonds used to finance leveraged buyouts have 
plummeted as one-time highfliers -- including retailer Robert Campeau -- buckle 
under huge debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ford Aerospace formally announced some good news Monday: it has 
received a $220-million contract to provide Chaparral antiaircraft missiles to 
the Egyptian military. The award carried the highest dollar value of any in the 
history of the Newport Beach-based Aeronutronic division, considered to be the 
weakest of Ford Aerospace's far-flung operations. 
</P>
<P>
But though such foreign sales generally carry high profit margins, Aeronutronic 
is hardly out of the woods. About half the money will flow to the six 
subcontractors who also are involved in the four-year contract. Compiled by

BIG GAME'S A TV TUNEOUT, BUT IT FLATTENS FILM BIZ; 
</P>
<P>
SUPER BOWL: A TV RATINGS BUST, THE BIG GAME STILL TOOK A SERIOUS TOLL ON 
BUSINESS AT THE NATION'S MOVIE THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The San Francisco 49ers' rout of the Denver Broncos Sunday apparently produced 
the lowest Super Bowl TV ratings in years, but the event still wreaked its 
usual havoc at the nation's movie houses. 
</P>
<P>
Some other performance venues also reported smaller audiences because of the 
National Football League championship game. At the Canon Theatre in Los 
Angeles, so many women showed up Sunday to buy tickets for "Meetin's on the 
Porch," a play that focuses on three women's lives, that the men's restroom was 
temporarily converted into a women's room. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures from the A. C. Nielsen Co. indicated Monday that Super Bowl 
XXIV may have been the lowest-rated game since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
While final figures won't be available until today, data from 23 major 
television markets across the country gave the game a 39.6 rating, which 
suggests that just over 36 million households watched it. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which aired Sunday's contest, estimated that the final number will climb 
to a 40 rating. With each rating point equaling 921,000 households, that would 
translate to 36.8 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
That would certainly make this Super Bowl the highest-rated program of the 
1989-90 television season, but it would be a less-than-super Super Bowl 
performance. Last year's NFL championship was viewed in 39.3 million 
households. There were 37.1 million households tuned in for the 1988 game. 
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected ratings -- undoubtedly prompted by the one-sided nature 
of San Francisco's 55-10 victory over Denver -- apparently will not result in 
CBS having to reimburse advertisers with "make-good" commercial time. The 
network had not guaranteed a specific rating for the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the chance you take with sports," said Jon Mandel, senior vice president 
of Grey Advertising. "You could have an over-delivery (of viewers) or an 
under-delivery. You accept that risk." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the TV ratings, the Super Bowl took a serious toll on business at the 
nation's movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"The major studios avoid this as an opening date, and grosses were off among 
the pictures already playing," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Inc., which collects box-office results. 
</P>
<P>
Between Friday and Sunday, ticket sales to the popular "Born on the Fourth of 
July," starring Tom Cruise as a disillusioned Vietnam vet, dropped about 26% 
from the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Business for the Sylvester Stallone-Kurt Russell buddy movie, "Tango &amp; 
Cash," dropped 17% to $3.6 million -- and it dropped 40% on Sunday alone. "War 
of the Roses" lost 24% of its ticket sales from the previous weekend, and 
ticket sales for the Paramount thriller "Internal Affairs" fell off by about 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was not surprising. During last year's Super Bowl weekend, 
moviegoers also stayed away from theaters in droves, even avoiding big hits. 
According to Exhibitor Relations, ticket sales to two audience favorites in 
1989 -- "Rain Man" and "Twins" -- dropped about 30% from the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Super Bowl, however, didn't seem to make much of a dent in the 
business for "Driving Miss Daisy," Warner's sentimental Southern tale starring 
Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. After an additional 617 theaters were added 
to its release, the film became the biggest draw of the weekend, grossing $5.7 
million, or $6,375 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it didn't get hurt as much as 'Born on the Fourth of July,' 'Tango and 
Cash' or other more male-oriented films," said Rob Friedman, Warner's president 
of worldwide advertising and publicity, who added that "Daisy" has more appeal 
for female audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl had a mixed effect on attendance at other arts performances. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Performing Arts Center reported no slowdown in sales for 
Sunday's 2 p.m. matinee performance of "She Loves Me," the last day of the run 
for the musical comedy starring Pam Dawber and Joel Higgins. The 2,900-seat 
Segerstrom Hall was about 85% sold out for the performance by Friday, according 
to a Center spokesman, who described that as a typical figure for a Sunday 
matinee. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the 5 p.m. matinee of "Tony N' Tina's Wedding," at the Park Plaza 
Hotel near MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, was not affected by the game. But a 
couple of the actors playing ushers at the simulation of an Italian-American 
wedding did improvise on Super Bowl themes during the reception. One of them 
chided another for betting his car on the Broncos, to which the losing bettor 
replied, "Don't worry -- there are plenty of cars in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Publicists for "The Phantom of the Opera," the Mark Taper Forum productions of 
the Renaissance Theatre Company and "The Thrill," and the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center reported no discernible effect on attendance because of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, tickets were sold out for a performance of the opera "La Boheme," 
while the Old Globe theater noted a slight dip in sales for two plays being 
performed there.

ON STAGE OR OFF, TENUTA PRACTICES JUDY-ISM ; 
</P>
<P>
HUMOR: THE SELF-STYLED CULT GODDESS, WHO OPENS A SIX-NIGHT STAND AT THE IMPROV 
TONIGHT, SAYS SHE BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO STANDARD STAND-UPS, AND SHE GOES 
TO EXTREMES TO PROVE IT.

Some comics are soft-spoken, serious and even a bit shy offstage. But when Judy 
Tenuta steps out of the spotlight, she brings her persona with her. 
</P>
<P>
At least that was the case during a telephone interview last week from Tempe, 
Ariz., as Tenuta set off on a rambling discourse in a voice that ranged from 
trilling falsetto to gravelly bark. In movie terms, try Glinda, the good witch 
in "The Wizard of Oz," and Linda Blair in the latter stages of possession in 
"The Exorcist." 
</P>
<P>
Tenuta, who opens a six-night stand at the Improv in Irvine tonight, points out 
with something less than professional courtesy that she bears little 
resemblance to the standard breed of stand-up comic: "Toads telling their 
McDonald's jokes," she calls them. "You might as well watch the Weather 
Channel." 
</P>
<P>
Onstage, she is given to long Grecian robes in Day-Glo colors, with an 
omnipresent accordion labeled "J U D Y" her most prominent accessory. "An 
astronaut with fashion sense," is how she describes her appearance. "Buzz 
Aldrin if he knew how to dress." In interview and performance, she peppers her 
talk with third-person references to herself, with "giver-goddess" and "petite 
flower" running neck-and-neck as her two favorite labels. 
</P>
<P>
She mugs and moves with an abandon onstage that suggests an "I Love Lucy" 
routine gone terribly wrong, stomping about with her accordion as she belts out 
such ditties as "Love Slave." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Judy-ism, a self-styled religion wherein abuse from the 
giver-goddess is the main tenet -- "An insult from me is like a blessing from 
above," go the words to her set-opening song. Whereupon, she has her followers 
repeat an oath that includes the line: "I promise to destroy all pigs who do 
not worship Judy." 
</P>
<P>
Tenuta's cult of fans does worship Judy, even the men -- "love pigs" and "stud 
puppets" -- who take the brunt of her verbal assault. "They realize that I'm 
the one true religious leader," Tenuta deadpanned during the interview. "Unless 
you feel pain, you are not alive." 
</P>
<P>
She claims (distinguishing fact from fiction with Tenuta can be a tricky) that 
audience members are now coming to her to be healed -- like a guy in Phoenix 
who came onstage during the current tour, seeking a cure for his gambling 
addiction. Judy says he told her that he lost $9,000 in Las Vegas -- having 
forgotten, in his gambler's haze, that the chips represented real money. 
</P>
<P>
If he was looking for sympathy, he came to the wrong place. This, after all, is 
the comic whose standard exit line is: "You people mean nothing to me." 
</P>
<P>
"This guy, he looked like an eggplant with teeth," Tenuta relates. "They give 
you these chips and you don't know what they are? What did he think, they were 
Doritos? You crunch 'em and they make more?" 
</P>
<P>
The biographical facts on Tenuta are hard to squeeze out from talking to her 
but can be assembled secondhand: According to her press kit, she is 34, grew up 
near Chicago, attended college and held a variety of jobs before taking a 
course in improvisation at Second City. She has spent much of the time since on 
the road, building a solid following with her . . . ah, distinctive stage 
presence. She has appeared on several HBO comedy specials, cut an album and 
starred in a very strange series of Pepsi commercials. 
</P>
<P>
And where does Tenuta make her home these days? 
</P>
<P>
"Seat 13-A of Air Turkey," she says, "because I spend so much of my time astral 
projecting." Natch. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Tenuta performs today through Thursday at 8:30 p.m.; Friday at 8:30 and 
10:30 p.m.; Saturday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at the 
Improvisation, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Admission: $10 to $15. Information:

VENOM, VISION STILL WORK FOR GEORGE CARLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's just like George Carlin to face the '90s with a chip on his shoulder -- 
and a stream of dirty words on his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
The graying but unbowed Carlin -- one of hip comedy's respected elders, a 
veteran of the '60s who for years has combined angry topical commentary with a 
corkscrew-shaped view of life -- brought all sorts of hot opinions to the 
Celebrity Theatre on Saturday night. George Bush, Jesse Helms and (of course) 
Dan Quayle all got drenched in Carlin spleen. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of it was rant and cant, Carlin's yelps about how things should be, like 
when he took on the hypocrisies of the gay movement. Or just a lot of belching 
of four-letter words and dwelling on the bodily functions of people and their 
pets. You know, kid's stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But much of it was signature Carlin, an often right-on combination of venom and 
vision that was as intent on getting you to think as getting you to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
As is his custom, Carlin kept coming back to the nature of language, both as a 
symbol of freedom and as a tool for the good and the bad. In Carlin's world, 
people should say what they want, whenever they want, that's what the U.S. 
Constitution is all about, anybody who tries to stop us is asking for it. 
</P>
<P>
Carlin has a history of getting worked up over any abridgment of freedom of 
speech, going back to 1973 when his "seven dirty words" piece triggered a 
five-year Supreme Court battle on obscenity and the First Amendment. That list 
has grown into quite a monster by now and, as usual, Carlin closed his show 
with a raw reading of the censored slang he calls "primitive folk poetry." 
</P>
<P>
But before that, Carlin took on anybody -- from Tipper Gore to feminists to the 
disabled -- who in his view tries to prevent us from speaking our minds. He 
wondered why crippled has been expunged from the lexicon: It's a perfectly 
accurate word that's not an insult, he contended. Removing it, he continued, 
only shows our inability to face the realities of the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
He provided several examples of how the government has diluted the language to 
fit its own needs. In what turned into a mini-plea for Vietnam veterans, Carlin 
pointed out that during World War I, combat disorders simply were called 
shell-shock. Than in World War II, they became battle fatigue. The Korean War 
gave us operational exhaustion. And finally, soldiers returning from the 
Vietnam War suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if those guys would have got the help they needed a lot sooner if the 
government had said they were 'shell-shocked,' " Carlin yelled. "The pain is 
buried under jargon." 
</P>
<P>
The performance wasn't all political; about half focused on Carlin's cockeyed 
observations and little stories, many about people and their pets, especially 
dogs. A particular favorite concerned the proud redneck dog owner who kept 
telling everybody, "My dog is different, you gotta admit he's different. He's 
got one leg. I always have to lean him against something." 
</P>
<P>
Then there were Carlin's ideas for new products, like a yo-yo with a 2,000-foot 
string that you use at the Grand Canyon, and the flashlight "that only shines 
at things worth seeing." 
</P>
<P>
He also gave some advice on how to annoy people. Want to bug a bank teller? 
Wait in the longest line and then ask for change for a nickel. Want to bug your 
cleaners? Ask them to rotate the buttons on your shirt or take the stains from 
one pair of your pants and put them on another. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his bits settled well. In contending that any topic is worth 
humorizing, Carlin tried to make light of rape. Yes, rape can be funny, he 
said, asking the audience to "picture Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd." It 
escalated into a routine that wasn't funny, but shortsighted and insensitive.

Lisa Osteen, the 30-year-old daughter of the Rev. John Osteen, pastor of the 
10,000-member Baptist church, was taken to Ben Taub Hospital, where she was in 
stable condition suffering from burns, authorities said.

NO GIMMICKS, BUDGET CHIEF TELLS CONGRESS

President Bush's chief budget strategist Richard G. Darman defended the 
Administration's 1991 budget today against charges by congressional Democrats 
that it used gimmicks and lies to fool the public. 
</P>
<P>
"This budget stinks and lies," Rep. Marty Russo, an Illinois Democrat and 
senior member of the House Budget Committee, told Darman. 
</P>
<P>
In a preview of the battle of the budget to come this year, Darman found the 
$1.23-trillion spending plan under attack for cutting defense too little, 
domestic spending too much and for not raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said he looked forward to negotiations with Congress and would prefer 
that they discuss a long-term solution to the deficit rather than a one-year 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do look forward to all proposals. We don't want off the hook," he told the 
committee's first hearing on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said the Democrats are being unfair to say Bush did not make politically 
difficult proposals. He cited a freeze on cost-of-living increases in 
retirement programs as one that would cost Bush public support. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the charge that it used gimmicks such as rosy economic forecasts 
to help cut the deficit, Darman said the White House forecast has been accurate 
for the past six months and continued the same outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to be associated with a lie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have in reviewing (the budget) is that it repeats a lot of 
problems that everyone recognized as basically game playing last year," House 
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) said. "I think there's 
a kind of conclusion that this is not a serious effort at trying to achieve 
deficit reduction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost regrettable that I should have to say this, but of course the 
President is serious, of course I'm serious," Darman responded. "It's a 
tremendous amount of work that's gone into developing a budget like this. I 
believe it's defensible on the merits." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you would have taken that on some faith," Darman noted. "If it weren't 
serious, I sure wasted a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta urged Bush to consider raising taxes. He promised that he would call on 
Democrats to discuss cuts in domestic social programs, known as entitlements 
because they go automatically to qualifying needy people. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense reductions are on the table in a bipartisan way, and we ought to 
consider revenues and entitlements in a bipartisan way as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush budget would cut the deficit to $63.1 billion in the year starting 
Oct. 1 but its reliance on a strong economy to produce more tax revenue is 
suspect, the Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's budget limited Pentagon spending to $292.1 billion -- higher than this 
year's $286.8 billion, but 2% less than the total needed to stay even with 
inflation. Bush sought increases for expensive weapons systems such as $900 
million more for the strategic defense initiative, but a cutback of 38,000 
troops and the shutdown of dozens of military bases. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats complained Bush should have carved more out of the military.

BOARD REJECTS GATES' DRUG TRAINING PLAN

The Board of Supervisors today unanimously rejected Orange County 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates' plan to build a narcotics enforcement training 
center at Rancho del Rio, voting instead to sell the South County property, 
seized in a 1985 drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
Board members cited the training center's uncertain funding and the escalating 
budget of the Sheriff's Department as their main reasons in voting to sell the 
213-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"The board is at a crossroads today," Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth said. 
"We are in a poor fiscal condition in this county." 
</P>
<P>
Roth offered a list of items as evidence of "skyrocketing costs in the criminal 
justice system": the Sheriff's Department's $4.67-million budget deficit, 
covered today when the board approved a midyear supplemental budget package; an 
upcoming expansion of patrols in South County that could cost $3.6 million; 
projected staff costs at Theo Lacy Jail of $6.8 million, once the expansion 
there is complete; and uncovered annual debt service costs of $300,000 for a 
planned forensic science building. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the $4.6 million we approve today (to make up the current deficit) 
would be enough to meet the sheriff's needs," Roth said. "Sadly, that will not 
be true." 
</P>
<P>
Other supervisors echoed Roth's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any question this would be a welcome addition if 
everything fell into place," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said of the training 
center proposal. "I don't think we can fill all the gaps with our very small 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who compared his proposal for a training facility for "domestic 
soldiers" to President Bush's preparations to invade Panama, said he was 
disappointed by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure every narcotics officer on the street feels the same way," Gates said 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a sad day that we can't offer the kind of training they need. . . . 
I just hope we don't see things happen down the road that could have been 
avoided if the decision had been different."

MAN, 74, ARRESTED IN DRUG RAID

<P>
Culminating a three-year investigation, local and federal authorities arrested 
a 74-year-old man and two residents of his luxurious Costa Mesa home for 
possession of methamphetamines, marijuana and explosives, authorities announced 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were homeowner Michael Patrick Marvich, 74; Tina Marie Anderson, 25, 
and Collin Lee Quick, 51, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and U.S. Customs Service agents seized three kilograms of 
methamphetamines, 30 pounds of high-grade marijuana, a bomb, blasting caps and 
$23,000 in cash in a raid last Thursday, said Sgt. Tom Boylan of the Costa Mesa 
Police narcotics investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said it is unusual to find someone over the age of 60 involved in 
alleged drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a few big-time drug dealers in their 50s," Boylan said. "But as far 
as I know, this is the first one we've had that is much older than that." 
Arraignment is pending for all three suspects.

Authorities in six nations have frozen $20 million in "liquid assets" 
associated with deposed Panamanian Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the Justice 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Austria became the sixth country to freeze bank accounts associated with 
Noriega, said David Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken at the request of the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel also doubled his previous estimate -- from $10 million to $20 million -- 
of money in the various bank accounts that the U.S. government believes is 
associated with illegal drug activity by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The five other countries where bank accounts associated with Noriega have been 
frozen are France, Switzerland, West Germany, Luxembourg and the United 
Kingdom, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are liquid assets -- mostly bank accounts," Runkel told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The American invasion of Panama produced a number of documents that have aided 
in the investigation of Noriega's assets.

TREASURY CHIEF CALLS MOYNIHAN'S PAYROLL TAX CUT PROPOSAL 'GOOFY'

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady dismissed as "goofy" today a Democratic 
proposal to cut Social Security taxes, but agreed it has raised a valid point 
about the true size of the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the tax and savings provisions of President Bush's day-old fiscal 1991 
budget during an interview on the CBS "This Morning" show, Brady suggested that 
the Social Security tax cut would mark a retreat from earlier work to ensure 
the long-term solvency of the retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
After a bipartisan accord in 1983 "removed the idea from all Americans' minds" 
that the system might someday go broke, Brady said, it would be "the height of 
folly" to repeal the mechanism devised to ensure future benefits will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The target of his criticism was a politically charged idea by Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) to roll back payroll tax increases now generating 
reserves to pay the benefits of baby boom generation retirees beginning around 
2010. At the heart of the plan is what to some had been an overlooked reality: 
that surpluses from the Social Security tax are not being placed in an account 
for safe keeping, but are being lent to the Treasury to help cover the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Brady asserted that Moynihan "has mixed up" two different issues: the actuarial 
soundness of the Social Security system and the way the Social Security tax 
surplus is used to show a lower deficit.

POLITICAL PRISONERS TUNNEL TO FREEDOM FROM CHILE JAIL

In a spectacular escape, 50 political prisoners -- some accused in the 1986 
assassination attempt against President Augusto Pinochet -- fled jail through a 
carefully constructed 300-foot tunnel today. 
</P>
<P>
Police said six escapees were captured shortly after the breakout was detected 
about 2:30 a.m. A seventh was caught by prison guards because he was too big to 
pass through the tunnel and became stuck at the mouth of it. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners built a tunnel about 1 1/2 feet high and about 300 feet long, 
extending from the Santiago Public Jail beneath a street to an unused railroad 
station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the escapees were members of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, an 
armed branch of the Communist Party. Military prosecutors had sought death 
sentences for seven of the prisoners for their role in the Sept. 7, 1986, 
attack on Pinochet's caravan that left five bodyguards dead. 
</P>
<P>
In a call to a radio station, a person identifying himself as a spokesman for 
the escapees said, "After years of unjust imprisonment, of systematic violation 
of the right to due process, of scorn and violation of all our rights and 
brutal tortures, today we recovered our freedom." 
</P>
<P>
In a second statement to Santiago news media, five of the escapees said 24 
prisoners helped dig the tunnel, starting in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel went between the street next to the jail and a subway line 
underneath and was equipped with a system of electrical lighting and 
ventilation and a "rail" system to remove the dirt from excavation, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the 24 who built the tunnel went through first,and it was 
then available to any who wanted to follow.

A report that Mikhail S. Gorbachev may resign as Soviet Communist Party chief 
jolted the stock market today, sending it into wild gyrations and some traders 
to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were so volatile shortly after 2 p.m. that traders at one investment 
brokerage stopped trading temporarily while the market calmed down. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell immediately after the 
Gorbachev report, rebounded and then slipped again. It closed at 2,543.24, down 
10.14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,155 issues down, 392 up and 427 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 186.03 million shares, against 150.77 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.30 to 178.43. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index lost 4.04 to 345.50. 
</P>
<P>
"Confusion is reigning supreme. Most professional traders are on the 
sidelines," said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities 
Corp. in New York, as stock prices fluctuated during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said that from one minute to the next prices soared and dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a market of this kind for sometime. It's pulsating, vibrating 
without any sense of direction," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
As in recent sessions, the key index moved in a wide range, having been up as 
much as 10 points near the opening and down 36 points in the afternoon. The dow 
index was down 16.89 points to 2,536.49 at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the news alternately hit the financial markets, currency markets 
and commodities and metals markets. 
</P>
<P>
The report on Cable News Network that Gorbachev may resign as the head of the 
communist party fueled the stock futures market, which in turn drove the cash 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said after the initial reaction, traders were attempting to get 
clarification on the impact of a possible resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Before the report, interest rates and concern about financing for takeovers 
were the market's chief worries. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market also interpreted as negative this morning's remarks by 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the Joint Economic Committee in 
Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the probability of a recession is less than 50%, lower than 
previously anticipated, and that the current 4.5% inflation rate is 
"unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"Greenspan seemed to be signaling there would be no accommodation by the Fed on 
interest rates," said Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities 
Inc.

Salt Lake City investor Jon Huntsman, in his relentless pursuit of Aristech 
Chemical Corp., said today he expected to sweeten his bid for the chemical 
company to at least $27 a share -- topping a white knight offer by Aristech's 
chairman and Mitsubishi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall and the Japanese trading company had launched 
an $845-million, or $26-a-share, bid for the Pittsburgh-based polymers and 
chemicals company two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall and Mitsubishi joined forces in an effort to keep Aristech out of 
Huntsman's hands. Aristech had previously rejected a $25-a-share offer 
announced in October by the Salt Lake City businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech's deadline for submission of bids for the company expired Monday. 
Huntsman requested today that the deadline be extended to at least Feb. 14. 
Huntsman said he planned to submit a sweetened offer as soon as possible after 
completing a review of Aristech's documents.

Control Data Corp. today reported losses of $196 million for the fourth quarter 
and $680 million for last year, the worst annual performance in the computer 
maker's 32-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief executive officer, has 
said 1989 marks the end of a six-year restructuring that has included $1.4 
billion in write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
For the October-December quarter, Control Data lost $4.63 a share on revenue of 
$524 million. That compared with a net loss of $12.8 million, or 31 cents a 
share, on $933 million in revenue in the same 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 net loss of $16.11 a share on revenue of $2.9 billion compares with a 
profit of $1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, on revenue of $3.6 billion in 1988. 
The 1989 loss eclipsed losses of $568 million in 1985 and $265 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from restructuring charges of $215 million in fourth-quarter and net 
charges for the year of $663 million, Control Data was profitable in its last 
two quarters, Perlman said.

INVENTOR WINS PATENT SUIT AGAINST FORD;

AUTOMOTIVE: VERDICT ON INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD AFFECT SIMILAR 
ACTIONS AGAINST 27 OTHER COMPANIES.

<P>
Ford Motor Co. infringed on a former professor's patent for the intermittent 
windshield wiper used on its cars, a jury ruled in a potentially far-reaching 
and lucrative case for the inventor. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict Monday could affect similar lawsuits by Robert W. Kearns against 
General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and 
21 other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford case was the first to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The federal jury will reconvene Feb. 26 to establish how much Ford must pay 
Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled earlier that Kearns failed to 
prove he could have made and marketed the system on his own and thus can claim 
only a royalty on each wiper, instead of Ford's profit. 
</P>
<P>
Ford had contended that the patent was invalid because the windshield system 
contained no new concepts. 
</P>
<P>
But Kearns argued that a new combination of parts made his invention unique. 
The invention allows the driver to set the interval at which the wiper sweeps 
the window. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, a former professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who now lives 
in Gaithersburg, Md., obtained the patents between 1967 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns claimed in his lawsuit that he installed a set of his wipers on a 1962 
Ford and took it to the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns "made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering test designs" to 
Ford engineers, the lawsuit claimed. Because they repeatedly asked him to 
discuss designs, the lawsuit said, Kearns was led to believe Ford would buy his 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, his attorneys and Ford all said they were forbidden by the judge to 
talk about the 12-year-old case.

SUPER BOWL TOPS ON TV BUT CBS STILL LAGGING

<P>
Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a 
whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the 
cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 
million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside for CBS -- Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to 
the debut of the new series, "Grand Slam," to provide a good audience sampling 
and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night. 
</P>
<P>
It was CBS' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided, which resulted 
in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did 
two decades ago. Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out-rated Super Bowl XXIV, 
39.4 to 39.0. But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the 
estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This also marks only the third time that the network airing the Super Bowl did 
not win the week -- NBC managed it in 1979 and 1981. It also is only the second 
time the Super Bowl network was third for the week -- dating back to NBC in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were not to blame for all of CBS' troubles last week. The network 
tried some stunting, most of which did not work. On Monday it ran a popular 
theatrical movie, "Cocoon," which tied for 54th. The big winner was the 
American Music Awards on ABC, which came in 10th for the week.

Voracious beetles with a taste for religious works have brought havoc to a 
collection of some of the rarest books in Britain, London newspapers said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny munchers, a species of Australian spider beetle and biscuit beetle, 
happily burrowed and ate their way through a quarter of 5,000 priceless volumes 
at a library in Cornwall in southwest England before they were detected. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the library at Lanhydrock House believe the beetles were 
carried in on cut flowers. The tiny creatures then gleefully transferred 
themselves to the 16th and 17th Century book collection of 17th Century 
theologian, the Rev. Hannibal Gammon. Not until the staff began spring-cleaning 
the library did they discover bindings and pages networked with holes.

ABC says more than 1 million fans have signed on as subscribers to a new 
magazine devoted to the network's daytime soap opera scene, about a month 
before the first issue is even due. 
</P>
<P>
The planned six-times-a-year magazine, Episodes, is promoted as being free, but 
subscribing actually costs viewers $3 for the cost of the phone call to sign 
up. (The number is 1-900-860-2600.) 
</P>
<P>
Containing articles about the stars and stories of just ABC's four daily 
serials ("Loving," "All My Children," "One Life to Live" and "General 
Hospital"), the first issue of Episodes is due to be mailed Feb. 20, according 
to editor and publisher Amy Dorn Kopelan. The network expects to reach an 
initial circulation of 1.5 million.

The Bulls, seeking to give disadvantaged kids an alternative to drugs and 
gangs, are donating $1 million to the Chicago Park District to renovate more 
than 100 aging basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
"We view this as an investment in the youth of the city of Chicago," team 
Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Monday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Park District officials said they know of no other professional sports team in 
the nation to sponsor such a program for a municipal agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the Chicago Bulls for doing something that is totally 
unprecedented," said William Bartholomay, the district's president. "This 
professional sports organization is putting something back into the system." 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for new surfaces, backstops, rims and nets, and to make 
other repairs at more than 100 courts -- about half of them outdoors -- over 
the next five years, said Jesse Madison, executive vice president of the Park 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago's inner-city youth deserve an alternative to drugs and gangs," 
Reinsdorf said. "It is our hope that this contribution will go a long way 
toward providing that alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Madison said that the district would have eventually done the repairs but that 
budget constraints would have delayed the work for at least 10 years. The 
donation from the NBA team will allow renovations to begin in April.

For Wilson, the Holmgren meeting is probably the next to last interview. Once 
that's done, he said, he'll meet with Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill "and the

The NCAA investigation of the University of Illinois basketball program, which 
centers on the recruitment of freshman Deon Thomas, apparently blew open with 
testimony from a current Notre Dame player, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an assistant coach at the University of Iowa has denied that his 
school was the one that turned Illinois in for the Thomas recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
Citing unidentified NCAA and University of Illinois sources, the Chicago 
Tribune reported in today's editions that LaPhonso Ellis, a widely recruited 
high school standout from East St. Louis, Ill., told investigators he was 
offered money to play at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, a 6-foot-9 center, chose to attend Notre Dame after his 1988 graduation 
from East St. Louis Lincoln High School. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ellis nor Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps would comment on the 
allegations, the Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Ellis was questioned about the allegations by both 
NCAA investigators and attorney Mike Slive, who has been conducting the 
University of Illinois investigation.

Assistant Coach Jimmy Collins, the chief recruiter for the Illini, has become 
the focus of the investigation, and the school has barred him from recruiting 
on the road until the matter is settled. 
</P>
<P>
The probe has centered on a taped telephone conversation between Thomas and 
Iowa Assistant Coach Bruce Pearl in which Thomas reportedly said he would 
receive $80,000 and an automobile if he attended Illinois.

Weightlifters Subrata Kumar Paul of India and Ricky Chaplin of Wales failed 
dope tests at the Commonwealth Games and were stripped of their medals, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
David Dixon, secretary of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said Chaplin, who 
won a gold medal in the 75-kilogram class, and Paul, who won two silvers and a 
bronze in the 67.5 category, both tested positive and have been thrown out of

The Minnesota North Stars may consider moving to California if improvements are 
not made to the Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington, team President Lou 
Nanne said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we are serious about getting the building fixed," Nanne said. "All we 
are saying is that the building is going to be 24 years old and we want it to 
be state of the art." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the team would do if the improvements are not made by the 
Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, Nanne replied, "From what I'm 
hearing now, then we won't be here." 
</P>
<P>
USA Today reported today that owners Gordon and George Gund have discussed with 
Oakland Coliseum officials the possibility of moving the team to California. 
George Gund lives in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The team has also talked with the Golden State Warriors about being joint 
tenants in a proposed new Oakland arena, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Nanne said he does not know any specifics about the negotiations to move the 
team. But he said improvements are needed by next season for the team to 
continue playing at Met Center. He said the team has been negotiating for the 
past six weeks with the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission to make the 
improvements, which would cost about $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They are putting $15 million into the Metrodome for the Super Bowl, and that's 
just one day," Nanne said of the commission's decision to meet NFL requirements 
to host the 1992 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars have 25 1/2 years left on their lease at Met Center. But they 
are drawing fewer than 11,000 a game in an arena that seats 15,093 in 
Bloomington, a Minneapolis suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars already have ties to Oakland. The California Golden Seals, who 
played in Oakland, became the Cleveland Barons in 1976, then merged with the 
North Stars in 1978.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sally Nemeth got a taste of the commuting life in Southern California last 
week, on the evening her play "Holy Days" had its U.S. premiere here on South 
Coast Repertory's Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday on the 405," she said. "Nobody told me. I just didn't have a clue. It 
was a 45-mile-long parking lot all the way down. No lie. I come out to Los 
Angeles. I get a rent-a-car. Wow. They gave me a Mustang. They were out of 
Econoboxes. This Mustang has power everything. Then I pull onto the freeway. 
And stop." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old playwright made it to the theater in time for the premiere but 
missed the appointment for this interview by an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate being late," she continued by way of apology. "But I'm used to it. I 
mean, I live in New York. If you're on the subway, you get stuck between 
stations. The train doesn't move again for I don't know how long. You're late. 
Period. Now I know why people have car phones. I kept looking for one. I swear 
to God I was going to ask someone to dial for me. Bumper to bumper. No 
accident. No nothing. God knows why." 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth sounded as though she could have been inventing a monologue for one of 
her plays. Not that her characters speak even remotely as she does -- 
especially not Rosie, Gant, Will or Molly, the Depression-era farmers in "Holy 
Days" whose spare Kansas rhythms echo the dry wind of the Dust Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But Nemeth does get her ideas for characters by jotting down monologues that 
come to her out of the blue. She will "hear a voice," she said, and she'll 
record the words "just for myself," then decide whether they are "a speech or a 
whole world." 
</P>
<P>
The entire opening of "Holy Days" -- Rosie's soliloquy about daffodils -- came 
to her precisely that way, Nemeth recalled. "I thought, 'This is a world. This 
is the Dust Bowl.' I don't know why. It just was." 
</P>
<P>
The pale, gray-eyed, auburn-haired writer had no direct experience of the era. 
She doesn't come from a farm family. In fact, Nemeth said with a combination of 
embarrassment and amazement, she had even managed to get through high school 
and college without reading "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck's classic 
saga of a Dust Bowl family. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if you come from the country's heartland -- Nemeth is a Chicago native 
whose father started out in the Indiana steel mills -- you can't help knowing 
of the period, she noted. Indeed, no matter where you live, you would have 
heard of it if only through a Woody Guthrie folk song or glimpsed it through a 
Walker Evans photograph. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dust Bowl is American myth," Nemeth said. "There is something very 
enduring about that time, very large in spirit. Perhaps it has become ingrained 
in the American psyche because it was not a time of me and mine." 
</P>
<P>
After her monologues plant the seeds for her plays, the research begins. Nemeth 
is the sort of writer who likes to investigate her material and afterward lets 
it steep for months. With "Holy Days," the method resulted in characters whose 
language sounds naturalistic but on the page looks like poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told me my plays have the most minimalist writing they've heard," 
Nemeth acknowledged. "It is so stripped down in this one that Jeanne Paulsen, 
who plays Rosie, said the first time she read it she went: 'Oh, haiku!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Holy Days," written in 1984, was first produced in 1988 at a fringe theater in 
London, where the notices were so good "they were just absurd," Nemeth 
recalled. "It was kind of frightening. I thought, 'Will I ever get reviewed 
like this again?' " 
</P>
<P>
Her next effort, "Mill Fire," was finished in 1988 and reached the stage for 
the first time last year at Chicago's Goodman Studio Theatre, then was 
transferred to New York by the Women's Project. Another production will be 
mounted next month in London. The play unfolds during the late '70s in 
Birmingham, Ala., and revolves around a furnace explosion in a steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
"That one is the closest to my own experience," Nemeth said. "I don't mean the 
explosion. But I am very familiar with steel mills. My father used to put a 
hard hat on me and take me into the mills as far back as I can remember. When 
he moved up into management, we moved to steel mills all over the country. I 
spent most of my childhood in Delaware and my teens in Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth, who was commissioned in 1989 to write a play for SCR, has already 
delivered a draft of her latest work, "Spinning Into Blue," which also takes 
place in Alabama, this time in the backwoods along the Tennessee Tom Bigbee 
Waterway. The title comes from the central motif of a falconer who trains her 
falcons by spinning a lure in the air, Nemeth explained. 
</P>
<P>
To familiarize herself with the material, she sought out a falconer about whom 
she had read in a newspaper article. "It was the neatest thing I've ever done," 
Nemeth said. "I called him up and said, 'I want to come see you.' He lives with 
his wife on 40 acres way out in the woods. They bathe in a stream. They garden 
organically. They eat what their falcon hunts. Definitely back to the land." 
</P>
<P>
The theme of "Spinning Into Blue," however, is actually about abortion. And, 
she added, "it's pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Nemeth has begun working on another play, about pornography, 
which she plans to complete in the spring. The research worries her, though. 
"It will be told from the woman's point of view," she said. "I'm a little leery 
of what I'm going to have to do for this one." 
</P>
<P>
The playwright said she lives alone on royalties in a one-bedroom apartment in 
Brooklyn, N.Y. Productions earn her on average about $3,000 each, she said, 
"and there are not too many productions." A recent $17,000 grant from the 
National Endowment of the Arts has tided her over "just barely." 
</P>
<P>
So how does Nemeth manage to keep up with the high cost of living in New York, 
where she arrived from Chicago slightly more than three years ago? Her 
apartment is "really cheap," she said. "Only $500 a month. And they didn't 
raise the rent this year." 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of "cohabitation (with her boyfriend) has begun to rear its ugly 
head." That could upset the delicate economic balance. "We're both going: 'I've 
got this really neat apartment,' " Nemeth said with a laugh. "And you know New 
York. You don't give up your lease until you have the ring on your finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Nemeth's "Holy Days" continues through Feb. 25 on the Second Stage at 
South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain times are 
8:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, and 8 p.m. Sundays with Saturday and 
Sunday matinees at 3. Tickets: $20 to $27 (discounts available for students and 
seniors except on Friday and Saturday nights). Information: (714) 957-4033.

'60S RADICAL PUTS PAST BEHIND HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the nation watched in late 1969 and early 1970, John Froines and his 
co-defendants turned the Chicago 7 trial into a theater of the absurd 
protesting the U.S. political system. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then; this is now. 
</P>
<P>
The chemist, recently named director of UCLA's Occupational Health Center, 
wants to know why reporters can't ask about his public health career from 1974 
to the present. Why do they focus on his radical past? 
</P>
<P>
"People are always saying, 'Is John Froines the same radical he was in 1968?' 
The problem with those questions is that they do not look at how the society 
changes, how people change and how circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is the same now as then," Froines said. "I think it's more valuable to 
look at a person's history -- to see if they have been consistent within the 
context of their values. We still need student protesters because many of the 
problems of the '60s continue and new issues have emerged. But nobody's a 
student activist at 50. You'd have to have your head examined." 
</P>
<P>
Froines no longer lives like a student activist. He resides with his second 
wife, KCBS producer Andrea Hricko, and their 6-year-old son in a Spanish-style 
Santa Monica home that they recently enlarged. Natural light bounces off shiny 
wooden floors everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-11 and 180 pounds, the graying researcher with wire-rim glasses looks 
as if he could have been a college running back. He dressed casually for an 
interview in a plaid sport shirt open at the collar, a blue V-neck sweater and 
green cotton pants. He slouched with his hands in his pockets or touched his 
cheek to ponder questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam was a cataclysmic event in American history," Froines said. "It 
brought hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people together in opposition 
to war. I don't think those circumstances exist now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's (not important to) . . . worry about (whether) a demonstration in 
1989 was like 1969 because they are not the same eras." 
</P>
<P>
Today Froines resembles not so much a revolutionary as a man surrounded by 
comforts and immersed in middle-class pursuits. He skis, runs marathons, dotes 
on his son and works 60 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a 50-year-old father of a 6-year-old," he said. "My son and I spend a lot 
of time together. I do not like to travel as much. I basically work, spend time 
with my boy and do physical things outside." 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike some '60s-era activists, he also works comfortably with corporate 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the occupational health division of the Vermont Health Department 
from 1974 to 1977, he helped persuade the state's nuclear power industry to 
accept health standards tougher than federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
As director of a division of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
in Washington from 1977 to 1979, he was principal author of federal standards 
regulating workers' exposure to lead and cotton dust. 
</P>
<P>
He was named deputy director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health in Rockville, Md., in 1979 and joined UCLA as an associate professor 
of environmental and occupational health sciences in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As a professor, Froines conducted a study to determine which Southern 
California jobs and industries had the highest exposure to 500 separate 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
As the newly named head of the UCLA's Occupational Health Center he is 
overseeing another study to determine how some industrial chemicals cause early 
aging of the brain and how others interact with DNA to trigger the first stages 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, John Froines is one of the most meticulous scientists in the area 
of environmental toxicology," said Dick Davis, executive director of the 
Chemical Industry Council of California. The trade organization's members 
include Dow Chemical, the subject of Vietnam era anti-war demonstrations for 
producing napalm, as well as Exxon Corp. and Du Pont. 
</P>
<P>
Froines makes no apologies for being highly regarded within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they think I am scientifically honest, and I try to be," he said. "To 
have a high degree of scientific integrity is important to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not come down along ideological lines. I will clearly be seen as a 
worker advocate in occupational health, but will interpret science objectively, 
and I think that improves things for workers." 
</P>
<P>
Froines says he became devoted to scientific objectivity while earning a B.S. 
in chemistry at his hometown university, UC Berkeley, in 1963 and a Ph.D. at 
Yale in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Yale that Froines joined Students for a Democratic Society and began 
organizing poor whites and blacks in the Hill section of New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
He met fellow organizers Rennie Davis, Dave Dellinger and Tom Hayden, now a 
Democratic California assemblyman from Santa Monica. Froines did not know the 
other Chicago 7 defendants -- Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale and Lee 
Weiner -- until he went to Chicago to help organize street demonstrations at 
the 1968 Democratic Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Eight defendants were charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing 
state lines to incite violence at the convention. Six weeks through the trial, 
Judge Julius J. Hoffman declared a mistrial in Seale's case, sentencing him to 
four years in prison for contempt of court and reducing the eight defendants to 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial Froines laughed at a witness's answer and called it "stupid." He 
also refused two of Judge Hoffman's orders to rise and later defied the 
jurist's instructions by telling jurors that after they had left the room, 
fellow defendant Seale had been sentenced to four years in prison for contempt 
of court. 
</P>
<P>
Froines' antics were comparatively mild. Other defendants often put their 
booted feet on black leather chairs and sometimes wore black judicial robes, 
took them off and stomped on them. Rubin marched in front of Hoffman's bench 
shouting "Heil Hitler" and Dellinger shouted "You're a liar, Judge Hoffman." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these actions, a jury acquitted all seven defendants of conspiracy to 
incite violence. Davis, Dellinger, Hayden, Abbie Hoffman and Rubin were found 
guilty of crossing state lines with intent to riot, but those convictions and 
Seale's contempt citation were overturned on appeal. The defendants and their 
attorneys were also cited nearly 200 times for contempt of court, but all but 
15 of the citations, including all against Froines, were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his acquittal Froines entered public health work and in following 
years other Chicago 7 defendants pursued mainstream careers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rubin's New York company produces posh nightclub parties for yuppies, 
while former Black Panther Seale recently published a barbecue cookbook and 
works in minority recruitment at Temple University. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner works with direct mail and membership development at the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai Brith in New York, while Davis is president of a Denver think 
tank that develops technologies for the environment. Lifelong activist 
Dellinger resides in Peacham, Vt., and has protested U.S. involvement in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Former Yippie Abbie Hoffman committed suicide last April at age 52. Hayden is 
the only member of the group whom Froines sees. A few Saturdays ago they 
watched the movie "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
The further Froines gets from the trial, the more his feelings about it mellow. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless he recalls the trial as grueling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frightening. It was absolutely emotionally draining," Froines said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures from the trial shortened many of the defendants' relationships with 
wives or girlfriends, and Froines' first marriage was no exception. But he said 
he maintains good relationships with his former wife and his daughter, now 21, 
who live in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The researcher met his current wife when she coordinated the Labor Occupational 
Health Program at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Hricko is prominently featured in the photos Froines keeps on the window ledge 
of his narrow UCLA office. In one picture his then-3-year-old daughter from his 
first marriage strolls through a living room in a floral print dress and tennis 
shoes. Behind her on the wall hangs a Richard Avedon poster of the Chicago 7 
grouped around Froines. 
</P>
<P>
Next to that photo are four others of his blond, curly haired son, Jonathan, 
sitting in his mother's lap, holding his mother's hand, hugging a teddy bear 
and looking intently at the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In Froines' office, at least, his radical past and scholarly present come 
together.

A late January snowfall settles over Champaign, Ill., and Jason Moler and Kevin 
O'Connor make their way through the cold to another day of baseball practice 
under the bubble in Memorial Stadium, Illinois' football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They are Orange County kids, like nearly a quarter of the players on the 
Illinois roster. They hate the weather, but they love the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In his office, Augie Garrido laughs about the snow and ticks off the various 
preseason rankings of his Illinois team. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourth, eighth, ninth, 11th," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, the baseball coach with a style as smooth as a practiced pickoff move, 
left Cal State Fullerton in August 1987 after 15 years, 12 conference 
championships and two national championships. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Illinois, lured by the challenge, a six-figure contract and the 
persuasiveness of Illinois Athletic Director Neale Stoner, who had hired him at 
Fullerton in 1973. Stoner since has resigned at Illinois amid allegations of 
financial improprieties and is now director of the California Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
On the day he was named coach, Garrido said his goal was to win a national 
championship within five years. The first year, his team finished 26-20. It was 
not particularly impressive, but as Garrido watched Fullerton play in the 
College World Series under first-year Coach Larry Cochell, he revised his 
prediction. "Three years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Garrido's second season, Illinois won its first Big Ten baseball 
championship since 1963, advancing to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
regionals, where the Illini won a game and lost two. 
</P>
<P>
This season -- No. 3 -- Garrido has every significant player back from that 
42-16 team except one starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting News picked Illinois to finish fourth in the country; Baseball 
America says eighth, Sport magazine says ninth and Collegiate Baseball says 
11th. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if that's accurate," said Garrido, 49. "As far as accuracy goes, 
this is the old coaches' cliche, but that's what the season is played for." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest games of the season will be March 22, when Illinois stops at 
Titan Field during a 10-day swing through Southern California. Asked once if he 
would ever schedule Fullerton, Garrido laughed and said, "If we ever get good 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, he believes they now are. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion presents something of a dilemma to Fullerton officials, who are 
trying to decide whether that will be an appropriate time to formally retire 
Garrido's number. The decision is complicated by Fullerton's own prospects. If 
the Titans struggle, as some observers say is possible, honoring Garrido before 
the game could prove uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois seems poised on the verge of a success similar to what Garrido brought 
to Fullerton, although one trip to the NCAA regionals is a long way from a 
15-year record of 667-292-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're done yet by any stretch of the imagination," Garrido said. 
"What we did was win a Big Ten championship." 
</P>
<P>
How Garrido has made so much progress is rather clear. He has sought the same 
California players he used to recruit to Fullerton and taken them to the 
Midwest, selling Illinois as he always sold Fullerton -- as a way to make it to 
the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Who other than Garrido could have convinced a bunch of California players that 
the way to the major leagues is through Champaign? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't apologize for the weather," Garrido said. "If you're going to play in 
the big leagues, you're going to have to play in Chicago in April; you're going 
to have to play in New York when it's cold. . . . A pro golfer can't learn to 
play one golf course and expect to win on the PGA Tour. You have to learn how 
to play in different environments." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido's recruiting pitch is based on player development, and on his record of 
helping players on their way to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to get to the big leagues and be successful, they're going to 
have to develop as players. We know how to help them do that." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido sells players on the facilities at Illinois, such as the $2.5-million 
Proano Stadium, which opened for Garrido's first game, and the indoor practice 
facility. He advertises a schedule that includes early-season swings through 
Florida and California that simulate conditions in the Grapefruit and Cactus 
leagues. And he pitches the past -- what he did at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
There are players from Illinois on the roster, but the success has come from 
the California players. Eleven of the 27 players on the roster are from 
California, six of them from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them, O'Connor, formerly of Mater Dei High School, and Brian Roberts, 
formerly of Loara High School, originally signed with Fullerton but chose to 
follow Garrido to Illinois, even though it meant sitting out a season under 
NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
At first, there was some local resentment of the imported coach and players. 
Then came the successes of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They went from the kids from California to the good ole Illini," Garrido said. 
"It's amazing what winning can do." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Smith, a pitcher and infielder from Riverside Rubidoux High School, 
batted .363 and hit 11 home runs in his freshman season last year. And as a 
pitcher, he compiled a 10-3 record and 3.87 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Mulligan, a sophomore catcher from Diamond Bar, hit 12 home runs. Moler, 
who played at Esperanza, had a 6-3 record with a 3.48 ERA and batted .296 with 
three home runs. O'Connor, who has moved from infield to outfield, batted .323 
and stole 12 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Their goals this season are not modest. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to go to the World Series, that's everybody's goal," Moler said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor spent Christmas break of his redshirt season two years ago wondering 
if he should leave Illinois and return to California to play at a community 
college. He has no regrets now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be playing in the final game," he said. "We're going to get to 
the World Series, I really believe that. . . . All the guys last year got a big 
gold ring. That's a small step. That's not our final goal. Hopefully, we'll get 
rid of that ring and get that national championship ring, one that has diamonds 
in it."
