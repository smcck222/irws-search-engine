Randy Travis and George Michael each collected three trophies at the 16th 
annual American Music Awards. The awards, selected by a poll of 20,000 people, 
were presented during a three-hour ABC-TV ceremony from the Shrine Auditorium. 
Travis was named favorite male country vocalist and won the album trophy for 
"Always &amp; Forever" and the single award for "I Told You So." Michael was 
favorite male vocalist in both the pop-rock and the soul-rhythm-and-blues 
categories. His album "Faith" claimed the soul-rhythm &amp; blues album award. 
Whitney Houston won the favorite female pop-rock and rhythm &amp; blues 
vocalist categories. Other winners included Guns N' Roses, whose "Sweet Child 
O' Mine" won best pop-rock single, and Freddie Jackson, whose "Nice 'N' Slow" 
took the R&amp;B single award. Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine won 
the best pop-rock group trophy, Gladys Knight and the Pips took best R&amp;B 
group and Alabama won for country group. Def Leppard swept the heavy metal 
category as favorite artist and for the album "Hysteria." The new rap category 
award went to favorite artist Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince and their album 
"He's The D.J. I'm The Rapper."

 -- If you want to fit in when you visit the Windy City, you had better mind 
your manners. Chicago was voted the most polite city in America by business 
executives in etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart's fifth annual survey. 
"Chicago has such healthiness, such feeling, such spirit," Stewart said from 
her Kewanee home in western Illinois. The "little courtesies" shown by service 
people from waiters to cab drivers add up, she said. The rest of the Top 10 are 
Seattle; New York; Pittsburgh; Indianapolis; Denver; Charleston, S.C.; Boston; 
Peoria, Ill., and Dallas.

 -- Barbara Bush is interested in reading more than lips. The First Lady got to 
work on her main project -- promoting literacy -- with a meeting in the family 
quarters of the White House with Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and 
John Cole, director of the Center for the Book. The two men briefed her on the 
"Year of the Young Reader," a program initiated by the Library of Congress to 
encourage young people to love reading. National Young Reader's Day will be 
celebrated Nov. 15 with school and television projects as well as an exchange 
of children's books between the United States and the Soviet Union. Mrs. Bush 
has been involved in literacy efforts for years. SHIRLEY MARLOW

EDDIE LEVEQUE; LAST OF EARLY KEYSTONE KOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward (Eddie) LeVeque, probably the youngest and believed to be the last of 
the original, comically chaotic band of constabularies known as the Keystone 
Kops, has died in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
LeVeque was 92 when he died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mexico to a French-American father and a Mexican mother, his interest 
in movies dated to the Mexican Revolution when he began hanging around an 
American film company in Juarez that was recording that civil struggle. He 
became their interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Gilbert LeVeque, said Monday that his father first came to Hollywood 
in 1914 and was cast by D. W. Griffith in "Intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
He next moved to the Keystone production company founded by Charles O. Bauman 
and Adam Kessel. There, director Mack Sennett was conducting Mabel Norman, Fred 
Mace, Ford Sterling and other silent stars of the day through the dizzying 
slapstick that became the Keystone signature. 
</P>
<P>
The Keystone Kops became a favorite of the Sennett comedies. They were usually 
featured in a series of misadventures that involved split-second sight gags and 
the inevitable chase scene. 
</P>
<P>
LeVeque, his son said, was proudest that he was with the original group at the 
Keystone studio. In 1915, Keystone was absorbed by the Triangle film company. 
That was one year after a young English comic named Charlie Chaplin had come 
into the company. In 1917 -- the same year LeVeque quit the studio to fight in 
World War I -- Sennett became an independent producer. 
</P>
<P>
Sennett then formed a second group of Keystone Kops that continued to perform 
into the 1920s. But LeVeque is believed to have been the last of the formative 
group. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, LeVeque returned to Hollywood and appeared in such epic silents 
as "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" with Rudolph Valentino and "The Black 
Pirate" with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Later he worked as a disc jockey on a Spanish language radio station and 
continued to do small parts in films, often cast as the kindly priest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters and six grandchildren.

H. BRADLEY JONES; LEGAL SCHOLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
H. Bradley Jones, a nationally prominent tax lawyer who helped found what its 
attorney members called simply "The Group," a band of legal scholars who fought 
successfully for the right of professional people to incorporate, died Saturday 
at St. John's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
He was 69 and his family said he died after a short illness. 
</P>
<P>
A 1945 graduate of Harvard Law School, Jones' civic and professional 
affiliations fill more than two single-spaced pages of his professional resume 
while his writing and speaking credits involve nearly four more. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his activities took place in corporate board rooms or before tax and 
appellate courts. But in 1982 he briefly became a public figure when he spoke 
out on what he and many colleagues saw as potential devastation in federal 
tax-increase legislation, specifically its effect on private pension and health 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Jones warned at the time that without incentives to set up private pension 
plans, professionals who are already incorporated would dissolve their 
corporations, leaving their employees without retirement and health rograms. 
</P>
<P>
Years earlier he had been the driving force behind "The Group," having written 
an article for the autumn, 1958, Fordham Law Review that became a rallying call 
for the incorporation movement. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Mary, two daughters, a son and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at All-Saints Episcopal 
Church in Pasadena.

A. WEINBERG; WRITER AND SOCIAL HISTORIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Social historian and author Arthur Weinberg, probably best known for his 
biographical works on legendary attorney Clarence Darrow, died Saturday at a 
Chicago hospital. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg wrote "Attorney for the Damned," an anthology of Darrow's greatest 
case summations, in 1957; it was on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 
weeks. He also co-authored with his wife, Lila, six other works of nonfiction, 
including "Clarence Darrow: A Sentimental Rebel" in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The others are "The Muckrakers," selected for the White House library during 
the John F. Kennedy Administration; "Instead of Violence," a study of 
nonviolence through the ages; "Some Dissenting Voices," a book about dissenters 
aimed at young adults; "Verdicts Out of Court," another Darrow study, and 
"Passport to Utopia," about economic and social highlights in U.S. history. 
Both "A Sentimental Rebel" and "Verdicts" are to be rereleased this spring. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Weinberg was a 1988-89 Lloyd Lewis Fellow in American 
History at Chicago's Newberry Library, where he spent many years as a scholar 
and researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a "philosophical anarchist," Weinberg was active in the 
Industrial Workers of the World and served a term as its president during the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Weinberg and his wife were working on "Bold Spirits: 
Women of Hull House," about the early women who lived in that pioneering place, 
and also were consultants on two television projects about Darrow's life. 
</P>
<P>
His writing and book reviews have appeared in numerous publications, including 
the Saturday Review, Ebony, the Progressive and the Los Angeles Times.

COURT TOLD OF 'CONFUSION' OVER MISSING MARINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JACKSONVILLE, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend of a Marine who died when he was left behind in the Mojave desert 
after a training exercise testified Monday he had asked about his friend's 
absence a day before he was reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
There was "total confusion" when Lance Cpl. Jason Rother was discovered 
missing, Lance Cpl. Kevin Robertson said at the court-martial of Rother's 
platoon sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Christopher Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying an 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, died when he was left at his post as a road guide, 
after a training exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing until nearly two 
days later and his remains were not found until Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled Tuesday for 1st Lt. Allen Lawson, who also is charged 
with dereliction of duty. His general court-martial is expected to start Feb. 
7. A third Marine, Sgt. Thomas Turnell, faces a special court-martial Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Turnell was Rother's squad leader. Lawson was in charge of placing road guides 
on the evening of Aug. 30 at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
During the military exercise "Rother wasn't making it. He fell behind. He was 
suffering bad back pain and becoming a heat casualty," Robertson testified. 
</P>
<P>
He said Clyde told him the night of Aug. 30 he had placed Rother on an easy 
work detail, an apparent reference to the road guide assignment, in which 
Rother was to direct a convoy through the desert. He was not picked up when the 
exercise was over. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 p.m. on Aug. 31, Robertson testified, he asked Turnell and a corporal 
where Rother was. Turnell said Rother was on a working party and the corporal 
said he would check on Rother, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rother was not in his bunk at Camp Wilson when Robertson awoke on Sept. 1. 
Robertson said he reported Rother's absence to Clyde, who said he would check. 
</P>
<P>
At about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 1, Robertson testified, Clyde told him Rother was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he knew Clyde tried to send Rother to the rear during the 
exercise to let Rother rest and that it was Clyde who determined Rother was 
missing. "He's a leader and a good one," Robertson said of Clyde.

AL MARTINEZ: PEOPLE KILLING PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who calls himself Homer telephones occasionally to express his 
displeasure with the various social programs that blow like summer breezes 
through L.A. He begins his conversations without preamble. "You read about 
those crapheads wanting to spend millions to take care of abused kids?" he 
demands when I answer the phone with a pleasant hello. "Well, Homer," I say 
sweetly, "nice to hear from you again. How are things in Hell?" 
</P>
<P>
I stay sweet because it is a policy at the L.A. Times to remain courteous even 
though there is some nut on the other end of the line calling me names that 
would make a street cop blush. Homer from Hell has never indicated a tendency 
toward violence, and therefore I tolerate his periodic calls as a way of 
keeping in touch with those who, though not blessed with superior insight, are 
still able to tie their own shoes and remember their way home. 
</P>
<P>
Homer's most recent call came yesterday. He disagrees with the effort by City 
Councilman Nate Holden to get semiautomatic weapons off the streets by buying 
them for $300 each from his campaign fund and turning them over to the LAPD for 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Homer feels that his constitutional rights are being violated even though no 
one is forcing anyone to turn in their shootin' irons. Holden is simply 
offering a method by which someone can pick up a few bucks by selling 
something, and if they make a little profit, so what? That's the American Way. 
</P>
<P>
"What they ought to be doing is issuing AK-47s to our citizens," Homer said, 
"not taking them away. There's a war going on in this city, and it sure as hell 
isn't the bad guys who are turning in their weapons. When the riots come, we'll 
wish we had them!" 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say in terms not printable in a newspaper famous for nice manners 
that we all ought to offer to buy AK-47s back from Holden for more than he paid 
for them, an enticement he surely would not be able to resist since the profit 
would fatten his campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
"He's already gotten the news space out of it," Homer said, "and now if he's 
going to run for mayor, he can use the do-re-me. You can call this People 
Helping People." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked Holden's press secretary, Paulette Jones, if the whole thing was 
just a publicity stunt, she bristled and said that was nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't expect her to say, "Yes, Al, you're right. Isn't it a wonderful 
gimmick?" because press secretaries just don't do that. But on the other hand I 
hadn't expected her to elevate a somewhat prosaic notion to the level of 
genius, which was her exact approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a genius program," Paulette explained, "because it gets the message 
across and at the same time gets guns off the street. Nate had always been a 
gun control advocate. This just keeps the topic alive and has nothing to do 
with any campaign. We've had 44 guns turned in already." 
</P>
<P>
We were talking on the telephone so I don't know if she was reading from a 
prepared text or not, but if she was, it must have contained stage directions 
to keep it light because she got less prickly as the conversation continued. At 
the end I felt she was pleased I had even expressed an interest in her boss's 
genius and might say "have a nice day" at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Genius was not a factor when I discussed guns with a cop I have known for many 
years and whose name I would use only at the risk of severe consequences for 
both of us. He, to begin with, would be buying a lot of departmental grief for 
any opinion he expressed, and I would be subject to his wrath, which would be 
even worse. I am small and afraid and wish to avoid anyone's wrath, especially 
a cop's, so I'll call him Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes is against private ownership of any rifle not required for killing deer, 
unless the deer are organized and armed and attacking in vast numbers. "You 
need an assault weapon like you need four wives," was the way Stokes put it. 
"People say they're going to use them for burglars, but those damned rifles are 
so powerful they'd go through a burglar, the house, a tree and the guy next 
door. There is no more reason for owning an AK-47 than there is in owning an 
F-16." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes believes Holden's campaign will do about as much good as asking gang 
members to turn in their Uzis for slingshots. "The only way to cut down on 
private ownership," he said, "is to make selling the damned things illegal." 
But with the NRA as powerful as it is, even that seems unlikely. Charlton 
Heston will be able to convince guys like Homer from Hell that the deer are 
already arming and God help us if they ever start marching on the cities.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-alarm fire early Monday at a Mission Gorge restaurant was caused by an 
employee who accidentally left food cooking unattended, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called to The Bake House, 10450 Friars Road, about midnight. 
When the flames began burning through the kitchen ceiling, the first 
firefighters on the scene evacuated the building and summoned reinforcements, 
said Larry Stewart, a spokesman for the San Diego Fire Department. About 100 
firefighters eventually were dispatched to fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no injuries, a burning piece of facade fell and nearly hit 
one firefighter, Stewart said. He escaped injury when two other firefighters 
pulled on the hose he was holding, drawing him out from under the facade as it 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
Two neighboring businesses, The Main Attraction and Troy's Jr. Greek &amp; 
American Cuisine, suffered ceiling and attic damage. Damage to The Bake House 
was estimated at $1 million.

AGUIRRE MUST REPAY $50,250 TO DUFFY, FILNER FOR ELECTION SUIT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorney Mike Aguirre, who lost a hotly contested District 8 San Diego City 
Council seat to Bob Filner in 1987 and then lost a lawsuit he filed against the 
victor and Sheriff John Duffy in 1988, now must pay some of the legal bills the 
pair incurred during their defense, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright issued a written order Friday, 
directing Aguirre to pay $50,250 toward the legal tabs of Filner and Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre's suit contended that the two violated his constitutional rights in a 
campaign flyer. The judge ordered $30,000 to go toward Filner's legal expenses 
and $20,250 to go toward Duffy's. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who is attending Harvard for a one-year graduate study program, did 
not return messages left on his answering machine Monday to respond to the 
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees for Lawyers 
</P>
<P>
Of the amount awarded to Duffy, $10,500 is allocated to pay his personal 
attorney, and $9,750 is for his county counsel, who defended the sheriff in his 
official capacity. Filner spent about $50,000 for his defense, while Duffy said 
he spent about $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit for unspecified damages, which was dismissed by Enright last 
September, alleged that Filner enlisted the aid of Duffy -- along with his 
authority as an elected official -- for a combination endorsement and attack on 
Aguirre in the campaign mailer sent out just before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Meyer, Aguirre's law partner who is handling the case, said an appeal 
of the decision could not be ruled out. But she conceded that Friday's decision 
may be the final activity in the feud. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't rule it out positively," Meyer said. "I want to make sure that I've 
looked at all the aspects and then make a final decision. As far as Judge 
Enright's decision, it's quite possible it will be the final say in the 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who has discussed Enright's order with Aguirre, said she "couldn't 
accurately gauge" the attorney's reaction.

Aguirre ran an unsuccessful campaign against Filner in 1987 for the bitterly 
contested 8th District council seat. During the campaign, the controversial 
mailer was sent out on behalf of Filner just before the November election, 
bearing a depiction of the sheriff's official badge and the headline: "A Strong 
Letter From Sheriff Duffy." In the letter, the sheriff endorsed Filner and 
described Aguirre as lacking integrity and accused him of being "a practitioner 
of the big lie." 
</P>
<P>
Filner hailed the judge's order on Monday as a victory, saying it sends out the 
message that candidates for public office should not fear lawsuits from a loser 
in the wake of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will help candidates who run against attorneys not to be 
intimidated," Filner said. "An attorney can say, 'If you win, then I will sue.' 
That kind of intimidation is not going to be successful if you don't have a 
foundation for it. I think, if it would have been successful, there would have 
been a real chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry. Originally, this thing cost me over $50,000 and a year's worth of 
trouble. During the primaries, there were 10 of us (candidates) who joked about 
who was going to be sued by Aguirre. We always joked, at the time, that he had 
a reputation for this, and then he did it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Bet I'm Satisfied' 
</P>
<P>
Duffy echoed Filner's comments, saying the order would discourage political 
opponents from "bringing their political squabbles into the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
"You bet I'm satisfied," Duffy said Monday. "The judge's ruling on the 
attorney's fees, I think, is a real vindication. My attorneys told me there was 
a 50% chance of getting them." 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges made in the original suit, Aguirre contended that the mailer 
violated his right to free speech, undermined his right to run for office and 
raised other federal constitutional questions. At that time, Aguirre said he 
thought "there's still something there." 
</P>
<P>
And Meyer reiterated Aguirre's earlier comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say I think the papers filed in court say there's 
something there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, word of the ruling has prompted a stream of congratulatory phone 
calls to Filner's office at City Hall, he said.

HOPE PREVAILS DESPITE PLAN TO CLOSE EMERGENCY ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spirits in the emergency room at San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital 
were high Monday as doctors hoped for a solution to the hospital's financial 
problems and the recent announcement that its emergency room will close March 
28, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's hope up until the day it closes," said Tom Hennessy, chief executive 
officer for the hospital, which serves Southeast San Diego. "If some solution 
to the funding problem can be found, there's a chance that the department can 
remain open." 
</P>
<P>
But a specific solution is nowhere in sight. National Medical Enterprises, 
which operates the hospital, announced Friday that it will close the emergency 
room because of "serious financial losses." Don Griffin, vice president of 
business development for NME, said the company had lost more than $20 million 
since 1982, primarily because of inadequate reimbursement from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital finds itself in a situation like 
so many other hospitals in the state of California, and it is faced with no 
alternative other than to close its emergency room or continue to face 
disastrous financial implications," Michael H. Focht Sr., president of NME, 
said in a statement about the closure. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's contracts with the County Medical Services and the County Jail 
will also be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have to Find Other Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Asked where people in the area would go for walk-in care, Griffin said: "The 
reason we issued notice on Friday was to inform patients in the area that we'd 
no longer be providing emergency service, and by the time March 28 comes, they 
should have identified other places to go." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said that, according to the American Medical Assn., one out of seven 
hospitals in the country will close in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The closest hospital is Paradise Valley in National City, which also has 
announced plans to close its emergency room in May. UC San Diego Medical Center 
in Hillcrest and Mercy Hospital will probably receive more patients when the 
emergency room at Physicians &amp; Surgeons closes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, NME announced plans to sell the hospital to Nationwide Medical Systems 
of Perris, Calif. The sale was finally rejected, Griffin said Monday, because 
the city of San Diego refused to grant clear title to the property. 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilman Wes Pratt said NME and Nationwide had failed to convince 
the city that they planned to continue to operate the facility as a hospital. 
"There was no reasonable assurance that what they were proposing was going to 
work . . . and there was no assurance that they were going to operate as a 
hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An aide for County Supervisor Leon Williams, who represents the central-region 
residents who use the emergency room at Physicians &amp; Surgeons, said the 
supervisor was extremely disappointed and his staff is working to keep the 
department open. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to allow those people in Southeast San Diego who were 
serviced by Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital to go wanting for medical 
services," said aide Neal Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hennessy said, the emergency room was packed with "a tremendous 
volume of patients."

PRISONER IN HOSPITAL KIDNAPS GUARD, ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hospitalized prisoner being guarded by a private security officer hired by 
the Sheriff's Department escaped when he and his girlfriend kidnaped the guard, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ismael Valdez, 27, had been taken to Mercy Hospital for treatment of a 
gunshot wound after a car chase Thursday with National City police. He was 
arrested on suspicion of narcotics and weapons violations, and was being held 
on a no-bail warrant for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Sheriff's Department spokesman, Valdez's girlfriend, Teresa 
Juliana Reyes, about 24, had been given permission to visit Valdez. When she 
arrived Sunday afternoon, she told the guard stationed outside Valdez's room 
that she had a bomb and a weapon in the sack she was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
She and Valdez then forced the guard to take Valdez, in a wheelchair, to the 
first floor of the hospital. The three then drove to Mexico in Reyes' car, the 
spokesman said. The car was described as a tan or beige Chevrolet Chevette 
whose license plate had black lettering on a blue background. 
</P>
<P>
At the guard's request, the pair let him out in Mexico, and he found his way to 
the border and called the Sheriff's Department. Authorities would not release 
the name of the guard, who is an employee of Wackenhut Corp., a security firm 
under contract to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital guards are unarmed and do not wear uniforms, said sheriff's Lt. 
Sylvester Washington, a shift watch commander at County Jail downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department "prefers it that way," he said. "The guards don't have 
adequate training to be armed." Inmate patients are not separated from other 
patients, he added, although the jail has a hospital ward for recuperating 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said it's a wonder hospital escapes aren't more common. "We've been 
lucky, very lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Valdez, who goes by the aliases Ismael Gomez, Michael Antonio 
and Mike Valdez, is considered armed and dangerous.

RACE FOR THE EXITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is accelerating the withdrawal of the last 20,000 troops that 
it still has in Afghanistan, raising the possibility that its pullout could be 
completed before the deadline set for Feb. 15. The Russians, though, aren't the 
only foreigners running for the exits. The United States, the major Western 
European countries and Japan have told their diplomats and other nationals to 
go, and quickly. Afghan officials profess to see in these departures a plot to 
destabilize the Communist regime that will be left to fend for itself after the 
last Soviet soldier has gone home. It is not sinister political design that 
motivates this exodus, however, but the well-founded fear that anarchy and 
civil war are about to descend on the country, leaving everyone -- Afghan or 
foreigner -- exposed and at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The rebellion mounted by the Afghans against Soviet occupation eight years ago 
and now apparently about to be turned in full fury against the Soviet-backed 
regime in Kabul is unlike any in recent memory. It is a rebellion without a 
unifying and centralized leadership, lacking in common goals (except a virulent 
opposition to Marxism), torn by competing personal ambitions and bitter tribal 
feuds. There are a half-dozen major resistance groups operating out of 
Pakistan, where several million Afghans live as refugees. There are other, 
lesser-known armed units that draw their support from Iran, where hundreds of 
thousands of Afghans have also found haven. Still other bands that are little 
more than criminal gangs are believed ready to emerge from mountain valleys and 
urban alleyways to seize their part of the spoils. 
</P>
<P>
An Afghan historian was asked the other day why Soviet forces so clearly on 
their way out of the country continue to be attacked, inviting terrible 
retribution in return. Ours, he said simply, is a culture of vengeance. That 
driving compulsion to settle scores and satisfy honor may be as old as the 
habitation of Afghanistan itself. Darius the Great and his Persian conquerors 
probably felt it 2,500 years ago; a lot of Afghans, and not just those who 
cooperated with the Soviets, probably are about to feel it now. If the great 
political fear in Lebanon is that irreconcilable religious animosities have led 
to the de facto cantonization of the country, the great political fear in 
Afghanistan must be that what is about to happen there could make Lebanon look 
like a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
In these conditions it is only prudent for foreigners to get out of the way, at 
least until clear signs emerge that some degree of order and security exists. 
Millions of Afghans, unhappily, do not have that same chance.

BILLBOARD BLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am in accord with Ken Roth of Huntington Beach (letter, Jan. 23) about the 
billboard blight in Los Angeles. I like to agree with Mayor Tom Bradley that we 
are now a world class city; that is, until I look around and see the 
proliferation of billboards. Paris, London, Rome we are not. 
</P>
<P>
Are billboards meant to be read by drivers? I thought drivers were supposed to 
keep their eyes on the road. Our mailboxes are stuffed with advertisements, and 
our television set bombards us with more of the same. Billboards are obsolete, 
and should not block our peripheral views of the unique openness of our hills, 
valleys, and basin. And this goes for West Hollywood, too. The billboards on 
Sunset are not pop art -- they are schlock art, and negate any charm the strip 
might still try to muster. 
</P>
<P>
And I don't even want to talk about telephone poles and wires. (Hey, wasn't it 
Mayor Sam Yorty who was going to put all electrical wires underground?)

QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was our first night in Los Angeles. Our daughter had some of the relatives 
over for a party and about 10 p.m. (midnight in Omaha), jet lag had set in and 
I went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning I woke to find that I had slept through an earthquake described by 
my daughter (who is used to them) as the sharpest she could remember (Part I, 
Jan. 19). 
</P>
<P>
My wife sleeping next to me in the same bed, stated that the bed was jumping up 
and down and she thought that she had vertigo again. 
</P>
<P>
The dog and cat went berserk. I was told that the chandeliers swayed for 
several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This is no way to show hospitality. My kids may be trying to tell me something, 
but we are going to stay with them for a week anyway. 
</P>
<P>
It will take more than an earthquake to scare me out of town, but I am glad 
that I live in Omaha where we only have tornadoes and blizzards.

REAGAN'S POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Lee May's article "Blacks Look Back With Anger at Reagan Years" (Part I, 
Jan. 20) one can understand why nearly 80% of blacks consider the Reagan 
Administration oppressive. Reagan has been a scourge to the hopes of black 
people. 
</P>
<P>
He has not changed. Before Reagan became President, he always opposed anything 
which aided the black people. He opposed the Montgomery bus boycott, open 
housing, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he continued along this same vein as President. During his 
reign federal programs like affirmative action, welfare, and health assistance 
were under constant attack. Under Reagan in 1986 blacks suffered an 
unemployment rate of 15% as compared to 6% for whites. Under Reagan we had no 
justice for the poor, but we did have bloated military budgets at the expense 
of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Most blacks are overjoyed that this man left the White House. They have 
suffered miserably under his heavy hand.

NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME IN U.S. COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRVING R. KAUFMAN, Irving R. Kaufman is a judge of the U.S. 2nd Circuit 
Court of Appeals, where he has served as the chief judge. He is a recipient of 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

<P>
Recent television coverage of sensational trials has captured the public 
imagination. Yet it underscores the conflict existing between a community's 
right to know and a defendant's constitutional entitlement to a fair trial. 
Important state criminal cases in the nation are increasingly televised, 
replete with instantaneous commentary by photogenic legal experts who explain 
the intricacies of proceedings that may change the course of a defendant's 
life. At the same time, U.S. law prohibits the use of cameras in federal 
courts. While greater access of broadcast media to the courtroom is desirable, 
recent experience in state courts suggests that removal of the federal ban 
would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deny federal judges any discretion in 
such matters. Though assailed both by defendants seeking to maximize media 
coverage of their trials and by broadcasters asserting the public's First 
Amendment right to be informed, the federal ban is inflexibly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Federal courts have ruled that a prohibition on televising trials does not 
violate the First Amendment if reporters are free to attend and convey any 
information that they gather. The presence of cameras in court, it is argued, 
impairs the dignity and decorum that are essential to judicial proceedings. 
While broadcasters strive to enlarge their coverage of litigation, the invasion 
of cameras into the courtroom risks casting judges, lawyers and parties as 
actors. Moreover, publicity attending the intrusion of television into the 
judicial process may fan the flames of community indignation over a crime, 
threatening to deprive defendants of their constitutional right to an impartial 
jury and a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
But cameras need not strain court decorum. Current technology allows for quiet, 
unobtrusive electronic documentation and telecasting of trials. While a TV 
camera is a powerful weapon that can devastate an accused in the public's eyes, 
the risk of impairing a jury's impartiality is present in any publication of a 
trial, whether by print or broadcast. In any event, judges are fully empowered 
to control the manner in which the coverage is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Television is a uniquely efficient tool for distributing information to an 
audience hungry for visual images and sounds to complement the printed word. 
The cynicism and distrust that some individuals bear toward the rulings of our 
courts result in part from lack of familiarity with legal reasoning. The 
properly controlled broadcasting of trials might shed light on the troublesome 
perception that the judicial branch is an undemocratic institution dominated by 
the arcane rules of the legal intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
The past 50 years have shown the historic and pedagogic importance of 
broadcasting quasi-judicial proceedings. Televised coverage of the McCarthy, 
Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings contributed to the nation's understanding of 
the governmental process. In each of these instances there was the concomitant 
risk of prejudicing some current or prospective defendant's right to an 
impartial trial. 
</P>
<P>
In 1791, during the infancy of our Constitution, freedom of the press meant the 
uninhibited right to write and distribute news. Publication of the printed word 
was then the best way to disseminate information. Today it is often asserted 
that television provides a method of communicating to greater numbers of 
people. It also allows viewers, it is argued, to experience events with their 
own eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
The architects of our Constitution did not define the scope or meaning of 
freedom of the press, nor did they describe the method for ensuring an 
impartial jury in criminal cases. These seemingly abstract and amorphous 
concepts were left to be adapted to modern circumstances by succeeding 
generations. Indeed, in a society where a majority of citizens rely on 
television as their source of news, it has been suggested that a ban on 
broadcasting any court proceeding is at odds with an evolving conception of the 
First Amendment. Although we are far from a consensus on this viewpoint, James 
Madison's words are frequently cited: "A popular Government, without popular 
information . . . is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both . 
. . . (A) people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with 
the power which knowledge gives." 
</P>
<P>
We will arrive at this stage of expanded freedom of the press only if the media 
are afforded full opportunity to fulfill their vital function of disseminating 
truth, and if they exercise that prerogative with dignity and regard for other 
constitutional rights. Unfortunately, too often the trials that are televised 
seem to involve sex, drugs, violence or racial animus. And if celebrities or 
political figures are parties, the viewing audience expands exponentially. In 
this state of affairs, federal fears, not state court hopes, are realized. 
Television now offers much glitter but little of the educational promise that 
broadcasting trials can offer.

HOLD BACK ON RETURNING PANAMA CANAL SOVEREIGNTY TO UNRELIABLE NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD B. SOLOMON and BRUCE FEIN, Rep. Gerald B. Solomon (R-N.Y.) is a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Bruce Fein, a private attorney 
in Washington, is a former associate deputy attorney general. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly before he left office, President Ronald Reagan urged the 
reconsideration of the 1977 Panama Canal treaty because of the unreliability of 
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
During his confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III also expressed misgivings about the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
One of President Bush's first acts should now be to declare the portion of the 
treaty transferring sovereignty to Panama to be provisionally inoperative. 
Congress should also play a constructive role in acting on these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega mocks the transfer's presumption of continuing Panamanian good faith 
and ability to prevent sabotage of the canal, and to safeguard its openness and 
security. International law would thus justify Bush's suspension declaration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1903 the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty granted the United States perpetual use of 
and sovereignty over a 10-mile-wide, 50-mile-long Panama Canal Zone. Under U.S. 
sovereignty, the canal has operated reliably, and without sabotage or 
interruption. It has significantly boosted the commerce and national security 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
During the Cuban missile crisis, 18 American warships transited the canal 
overnight, jumping ahead of commercial shipping to fortify a naval quarantine 
of Cuba. The U.S. warships would otherwise have consumed 13 days to navigate 
around Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Panama's history of violence, chronic political turbulence and 
anti-Yankee sentiments, it is little wonder that the 1977 treaty considers good 
will and friendly relations as being indispensable to carrying out the treaty's 
terms. Since its birth, Panama has had four constitutions. During World War II, 
pro-fascist President Arnulfo Arias denied the United States defensive rights 
outside the canal zone.In 1964 Panamanian students rioted in the canal zone, 
leaving four American soldiers dead and dozens wounded while the Panamanian 
police and national guard stood aloof. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1977 treaty negotiations, participants from both Panama and the 
United States openly acknowledged a basic presumption of good faith and 
political will behind the treaty terms. For instance, Panamanian negotiator 
Carlos Lopez Guevaro trumpeted: "The canal has no defense without the 
friendship of the Panamanian people" -- a view echoed by the Pentagon and 
President Jimmy Carter. Similarly, Panama's chief treaty adviser, Romulo 
Escobar, insisted: "I think we must begin from one major premise: that the 
United States and Panama are not enemies." American Ambassador William J. 
Jorden recognized that "(a)gainst a threat of sabotage to the waterway, by far 
the best defense was the good will and cooperation of the Panamanian people and 
their national guard." 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega's domestic- and foreign-policy gambits undermine that treaty 
assumption. He has thickened ties with Cuba, Libya and Colombian Marxist 
guerrillas, and harassed the 40,000 U.S. civilians and 12,000 U.S. troops in 
the canal zone. Indicted by the United States for complicity in drug 
trafficking and subject to a companion economic embargo, he exploits these 
actions domestically to bestir Panamanian ill will toward America. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 treaty terminates U.S. sovereignty over the Panama Canal and the canal 
zone in 1999. That stipulation, however, is limited by the higher treaty right 
of the United States to protect and defend the canal from armed attack "or 
other actions" that threaten its neutrality or security or the right of U.S. 
warships to transit the canal expeditiously in cases of emergency. The latter 
right requires maintaining U.S. troops in the zone whenever prevailing 
Panamanian conditions are inconsistent with good faith and Panama's capacity to 
honor its 1977 treaty obligations -- circumstances that exist today. 
</P>
<P>
International law empowers a treaty signatory to suspend provisions when a 
material unexpressed postulate of the negotiations proves to be false. Thus, 
during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a shipping 
convention suspended and inoperative because a continuation of peace was an 
essential premise of its provisions. Similarly, Bush should inform Noriega that 
U.S. troops will remain stationed in the canal zoneand that zonal security will 
remain untransferred in 1999 unless the United States then concludes that 
Panama is both able and politically dedicated to preventing an interruption of 
canal operations or a violation of canal neutrality.

SANTA CLARITA CALLS FOR LAW TO REDUCE TORRENTS OF TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, noting that two landfills are proposed near the 
city, has decided to attack the mounting garbage problem in Los Angeles County 
at its source. 
</P>
<P>
The council is looking for a legislator to sponsor a bill to require industry 
to use more biodegradable packaging and to cut down on the amount of plastic, 
paper and cardboard used in packaging. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) has not agreed to sponsor the bill, but an 
aide to the senator said Monday that Davis will submit the city's proposal to 
the Legislature's legal staff before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Counsel, which reviews potential legislation and helps draft 
bills in legal language, must receive all bills and proposed bills by Friday, 
said Hunt Braly, a Davis aide. The deadline to introduce formal bills is early 
March, giving Santa Clarita about a month to research the issue and find a 
sponsor, Braly said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Issue 
</P>
<P>
Details of the Santa Clarita proposal have not been worked out, but the city is 
prepared to help research the issue, said Asst. City Manager Ken Pulskamp. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of such legislation, Pulskamp said, is to reduce the amount of waste 
pouring into garbage dumps by cutting down on obviously decorative and 
unnecessarily large packaging. Pulskamp said many items are packaged in 
multiple layers of material. 
</P>
<P>
From Santa Clarita's standpoint, the proposal has symbolic value as well. 
Council members, who voted to seek Davis' help last week, said they want to 
show that the city is willing to combat the garbage problem and not merely 
oppose plans to put dumps in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The council is trying to take a pro-active approach," Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said Monday that industry would undoubtedly 
oppose the Santa Clarita proposal. But McKeon, who credited Mayor Jan Heidt 
with the plan, said the effort is worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to take a first step," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which voted to enlist Davis' help Jan. 24, did not discuss passing 
municipal ordinances to control packaging. "I just don't think it's practical 
on the local level," Pulskamp said. "It makes more sense if you can tackle the 
problem on a large scale." 
</P>
<P>
Planners with the Los Angeles County Bureau of Sanitation say the county's 
landfills are rapidly nearing capacity. These planners are eyeing Towsley 
Canyon and Elsmere Canyon -- both near Santa Clarita -- as possible dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The president of BKK, a private landfill company from West Covina, said last 
month that the company hopes to begin work on a landfill in Elsmere in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has not formally opposed the Elsmere plan, but some council 
members have said they fear a dump there would contaminate Santa Clarita's 
ground water. The City Council is tentatively scheduled to tour Elsmere Canyon 
on Thursday.

SERVICE UNION OBJECTS TO PLAN TO USE CITY WORKERS FOR STADIUM CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union officials charged Monday that about 80 maintenance workers could lose 
their jobs March 1, when the city takes over the cleaning of San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium and hires a smaller, non-union work force that will have only a 
handful of employees receiving benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Since the stadium opened in 1969, private janitorial companies have contracted 
with the city to clean up. The city now contracts with Pedus Building Services, 
a Los Angeles maintenance firm. The Service Employees International Union, 
Local 102, has represented stadium workers for 20 years and has negotiated 
contracts and benefits for them. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the part-time workers who have worked as many as 15 years with the 
stadium cleanup crew are among those who could be fired March 1, union 
officials said. On Monday, the workers said city officials had told them that 
they will have to cast their lots with other applicants if they want their jobs 
back. Notices mailed to the workers instructed them to apply for their old jobs 
on Wednesday, but the employees said they were told that jobs would not be 
guaranteed to them. 
</P>
<P>
This and other charges by the union were contested by Assistant City Manager 
Jack McGrory. City officials plan to hire "every single one of" the existing 
employees, provided they pass a routine medical examination, McGrory said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of them has been told what our commitment is," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earn $8 an Hour 
</P>
<P>
Custodians at the stadium earn $8 an hour, but the city announced that it will 
pay janitors $6.54 to $7.79 an hour when it begins hiring in a few weeks. 
McGrory said current workers will be hired "at the top of the salary range," 
which is 21 cents an hour less than what they now earn. 
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Medina, Local 102 president, charged that city officials are engaging in 
a practice that they have used in other departments where "hundreds of 
employees are in a permanent subclass without benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, city officials began looking into the possibility of using city 
workers to clean the stadium, and a city study determined that a savings of 
about $117,000 could be realized annually if city employees took over the 
maintenance. According to the study, 16 full-time workers with an undetermined 
number of part-time employees can be used to do the same work that is now done 
by Pedus' 80 part-time workers in the same amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
McGrory said that further review of the study shows that the city could 
actually save as much as $175,000. However, the city's savings claims were 
challenged by Medina. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that McGrory is exaggerating the savings. Our figures show that the 
city only stands to save about $33,000. . . . They're being penny-wise and 
pound foolish. But it's the callous way that they're going about this that is 
so terrible. There are people and families being affected here, but the city 
doesn't seem to care. These are the only jobs that these people have, and they 
don't earn that much to begin with," Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
Four stadium workers who met with a reporter on Monday said they earn an 
average of $6,000 a year. Last year was an exception because Super Bowl events 
at the stadium provided extra work days that helped three of them earn just 
under $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doing an Injustice' 
</P>
<P>
"The city is doing us an injustice . . . . We know that the pay is not very 
much, but we have benefits that were obtained for us by the union. Many of us 
have medical and dental insurance and paid vacations. It's the benefits that 
are important for us and our families," said Rodolfo Ibarra, 43, and a 15-year 
stadium employee. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Ochoa, 55, and a 10-year employee, said the health plan negotiated by 
the union allows the workers to be treated by doctors and dentists in Tijuana, 
where some employees live. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen to us and our families? . . . . The city must 
understand that what they are doing is affecting real human beings," said 
10-year employee Jose Porras Rubio, 65. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's plan, 16 workers will receive a benefits package that is 
better than the one workers receive under the Local 102 contract, McGrory said. 
He acknowledged that this is fewer than the 54 employees who receive health and 
welfare benefits under the Local 102 contract with Pedus. 
</P>
<P>
But McGrory says that "overall, the 16 employees will be far better off" under 
the city's benefits package. Also, the remaining part-time custodial workers 
will be in a position to move into full-time city jobs later on and "will have 
better job security with full civil service protection." 
</P>
<P>
Despite McGrory's assurances, the stadium workers remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres are going to have a good season," Ochoa said. "This means bigger 
crowds at the stadium and more trash. I want to see the smaller group of 
workers clean up this bigger mess in the same amount of time. The people who 
think that this is possible don't know anything about how the cleanup is done 
after baseball games."

SOLICITED MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI MAN VANISHES PRIOR TO SENTENCING 
</P>

<P>
A Simi Valley man failed to show up for his sentencing after writing a letter 
to a judge, saying he could not face the prospect of going to prison for trying 
to arrange the contract murder of his cousin, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Abed Mahmoud Jabaieh, 30, released on $200,000 bail, was scheduled to show up 
for sentencing in Ventura County Superior Court on Friday. He could have 
received up to nine years in state prison for offering an undercover sheriff's 
deputy $5,000 to kill his cousin, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Brodie. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Jabaieh, who pleaded guilty in December to solicitation of 
murder, is probably in Jerusalem, where he lived before moving to the United 
States. Brodie said he contacted federal authorities for help in locating 
Jabaieh. He said he hopes that Jabaieh can be extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jabaieh had first been scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 6. But Judge Steven 
Perren, on the condition that Jabaieh surrender his passport within three 
hours, granted a delay so Jabaieh could prepare a statement asking for 
leniency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Passport 
</P>
<P>
The passport was never turned over, however, and "the next thing we heard was 
in a letter postmarked from Oxnard," Perren said. "It was very apologetic, 
saying he was sorry, but he could not bear the prospect of going to prison." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear who was responsible for ensuring that Jabaieh turn in the 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
"This man had $200,000 cash to put up. That's just a pile of money. . . . It 
seemed like we had adequate security," Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
After authorities received the letter in early January, Perren issued a warrant 
for Jabaieh's arrest. Then court officials waited for Friday's hearing. "The 
letter could have been fraudulent. We had to wait to see whether he would show 
up," Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
Jabaieh, who owned a liquor store in Simi Valley, was arrested last February 
after asking a private investigator to set up the contract killing of his 
cousin, Jamal Jabaieh, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting With Investigator 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the investigator notified them of Abed Jabaieh's offer. A 
meeting was then arranged between Abed Jabaieh and the private investigator, 
who was to bring along a hit man. At the meeting, Jabaieh turned over $400 to 
the private investigator, who was accompanied by an undercover sheriff's 
deputy, authorities said. Jabaieh also promised that he would pay $5,000 more 
after the killing, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Brodie nor Jamal Jabaieh said they knew of a motive. "I never had any 
disagreement with Abed," said Jamal Jabaieh, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Jabaieh had sued Mohamad Jabaieh, Abed's brother, over the name of their 
competing Simi Valley Mexican restaurants. "I filed a lawsuit against Mohamad, 
not Abed," Jamal Jabaieh said.

MAN SOUGHT IN STAGED DEATH HELD IN TEXAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly faked his death in a Glendale doctor's office as part of a 
$1.5-million insurance scam was arrested Monday in Texas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Hanson, who had been the subject of a nationwide hunt, was picked up by 
U.S. Customs Service officials at the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport on suspicion of 
having a forged passport, said Columbus, Ohio, Police Detective James Lanfear. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson was jailed in Ft. Worth awaiting arraignment on a federal fugitive 
warrant. He faces state charges in Ohio. Hanson is a co-founder of the 
Columbus-based athletic clothing stores Just Sweats. 
</P>
<P>
Lanfear said police believe that Hanson was returning from Acapulco, where he 
went to see a plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, 47, and his business partner, John B. Hawkins, 25, both of Ohio, have 
been wanted by Ohio and California authorities since mid-1988, when it was 
discovered that Hanson was alive and that Hawkins had disappeared. Hawkins also 
faces a federal fugitive warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale and Los Angeles authorities launched a homicide investigation after 
learning that a man who died in the Glendale office of Dr. Richard P. Boggs on 
April 16 was not Hanson, but Ellis H. Greene, 32, of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office released the body to Hawkins after he and Boggs identified 
the man as Hanson and after two of Hanson's credit cards and a photocopy of his 
birth certificate were found on the body. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins ordered the body cremated the next day and as Hanson's beneficiary, he 
collected $1 million in death benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs told police that he had known the dead man as Hanson and that the man had 
been his patient for six years. He said the patient had a history of heart 
problems. The coroner's office had said the cause of death was inflammation of 
the heart but has since reopened its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Police later discovered the corpse's identity by a fingerprint comparison. 
Greene, who had moved to California from Ohio, was last seen leaving a North 
Hollywood bar April 15, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After officials began questioning the body's identity, Hawkins fled in July 
without collecting $500,000 from two other insurance companies, authorities 
said. He has not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million from Just 
Sweats, which they founded in 1985. Just Sweats has filed for protection from 
creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws.

GROUP CALLS FOR LIMITS ON HILLSIDE TRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sunland-Tujunga group said Monday it will ask residents to sign petitions 
calling for Los Angeles to limit the amount of housing allowed on hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gross, a director of the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents, said the 
group hopes to collect at least 4,000 signatures by March 1 from people who 
want to preserve undeveloped hillsides in and around Sunland-Tujunga, Lake View 
Terrace and Shadow Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Increased density on the steep hillsides could result in flooding, rockslides 
and mudslides, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization hopes to get enough signatures to demonstrate that the largely 
rural area's district plan, a guide for development, should be amended to 
include controls on hillside residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles zoning laws allow two to nine homes per acre of hillside, Gross 
said. The residents want the density limited to one home per hillside acre. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last open land in the whole city," Gross said. "We're trying to 
stop here what's happened in Woodland Hills and Glendale. You look at the 
hillsides there and you see nothing but bad. We can't let that happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Gross added that the controls would stop pollution of water and air and prevent 
extensive grading of the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
The group is sponsoring a kickoff meeting for the drive at 7 tonight at the 
Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building at 7747 Foothill Blvd. If the group obtains 
at least 2,000 signatures, petitions would eventually be presented to Los 
Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Arline De Sanctis, Wachs' chief deputy, said the councilman would welcome such 
petitions. But she said Wachs already has initiated studies on how to limit 
hillside development on slopes of 15% or more. Those studies, being done by the 
community plans division of the city Planning Department, are almost completed, 
De Sanctis said. She said they probably will be presented to the City Council 
in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The petition drive was partially inspired by a planned 44-acre, 125-home 
development in the hills of northeast Tujunga. Some of the single-family homes 
are planned for grades of more than 50%, De Sanctis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Dale Poe Development, which is preparing an environmental impact 
report on the proposed development, could not be reached for comment.

Labyrinths of Reason: Paradox, Puzzles and the Frailty of Knowledge by William 
Poundstone (Doubleday: $18.95; 274 pages) 
</P>
<P>
I wish I knew why I continue to be fascinated by philosophy, particularly in 
questions of knowledge, such as: How do we know what we know? When is something 
proved? Are there limits to what we can know? What are they? 
</P>
<P>
Like many philosophical questions, these matters have been thought about for 
millennia, and, sadly, we are no closer to the answers today than the ancient 
Greeks were. 
</P>
<P>
One intriguing question is why we think about these things at all. What quirk 
of mind brings us back to these same puzzling and insoluble dilemmas that are 
largely irrelevant to everyday life? Why all the razzmatazz? 
</P>
<P>
After all, there are no philosophers on the freeway. No one thinks twice about 
whether the cars are really there or what the consequences of hitting one will 
be. Faith in our senses guides us through most things we do. Why not carry it 
into all realms and stop worrying about how we can be sure and related 
conundrums? 
</P>
<P>
No harm if you do, but in the 20th Century, the questions themselves have been 
sharpened, and the ambiguity of the answers is also more clearly understood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Things We'll Never Know 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see everything, not even everything implicit in our experience," 
William Poundstone concludes at one point in "Labyrinths of Reason," his 
exceptionally good, crystal-clear survey of the limits of knowledge. "There are 
things going on out there that we will never appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
Starting with simple paradoxes and puzzles, Poundstone shows how the 
ambiguities and unanswerable questions of reason do not simply go away if you 
ignore them. Swept under the rug, they accumulate there until they are a 
noticeable bulge, affecting questions about the nature of meaning and mind 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Can you think of a common English word that begins and ends with the letters 
UND? 
</P>
<P>
How do you go about looking for an answer? You could try the brute-force 
method, starting with undAund, undBund, through undZund, then on to undAAund, 
undABund, through undZZund. But you will be at it a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
Many people hit on the right word without too much thought, certainly not by 
the brute-force approach. How do they do it? No one knows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thinking of Nothing 
</P>
<P>
Where is mind, anyway? It's in the brain presumably, but where? Poundstone asks 
whether the circuits of a pocket calculator have any awareness that they are 
doing arithmetic. Not that we can tell. But we certainly have awareness that we 
are doing arithmetic, or reading the newspaper or thinking about whatever it is 
that we are thinking about. Question: Could we be aware that we are thinking 
about nothing? Probably not. The awareness itself would be the thinking. 
</P>
<P>
But how do we know, Poundstone asks, that we are really experiencing all that 
we think we are experiencing? How do we know that our brains are not simply 
stuck in laboratory vats filled with nutrients and attached to electrodes that 
scientists stimulate to create the sensations we experience? We don't know, and 
we can't know, though it seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
This "brains in vats" riddle is the starting point for Poundstone's book, which 
then proceeds through paradoxes of induction and deduction, ambiguity and 
certainty, to show that there are inherent, inviolable limits of knowledge. 
Along the way, Poundstone discusses many famous paradoxes, such as the paradox 
of the unexpected hanging, the prisoner's dilemma and Newcomb's paradox, with 
many variations and twists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classic Paradox 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected hanging goes like this: a convicted man is sentenced to be 
hanged at dawn in the coming week, but the judge tells him that he will not 
know beforehand which day he will die. The prisoner is delighted. He reasons 
that the judge's sentence cannot be carried out: 
</P>
<P>
He cannot be executed on Saturday (the last day of the week), because once he 
made it past Friday morning, he'd know for sure that the execution would be 
Saturday, and that would violate the judge's rule. He would know beforehand 
which day he was going to die. So Saturday is out. 
</P>
<P>
Working backwards, that means he cannot be executed on Friday, either. Once he 
survived through Thursday morning, and knowing that he couldn't be hanged on 
Saturday, he would know for sure that he was to be hanged on Friday. That, too, 
violates the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
By the same reasoning, he can't be hanged on Thursday, Wednesday or any other 
day. 
</P>

So the prisoner sleeps soundly. Until Tuesday morning, when the executioner 
arrives and the prisoner is hanged. Despite the prisoner's airtight reasoning, 
the sentence was carried out, and the judge's order was obeyed. The prisoner 
didn't know beforehand what day he was going to be hanged.

Poundstone deftly discusses these matters and many, many more in an extremely 
lucid way. He is not the first writer to tackle these subjects for 
non-specialized readers, but he does it very well. If you have had trouble 
reading Douglas Hofstadter or Raymond Smullyan but are interested in these 
things nonetheless, Poundstone may be your man. His book is easier -- but no 
less deep -- than others on similar topics. 
</P>
<P>
"In few other fields is it possible for the interested non-expert to sample so 
much of the true flavor of the field and have fun doing it," Poundstone writes. 
His book demonstrates the truth of the statement.

Oh, the common word that begins and ends with UND. Try underground.

THE DRUG CLINIC: COPING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOSEPH A. PURSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am a case worker in a statewide system for treating troubled 
students. Presently I'm working with about 40 students who are hard-core 
truants. They are constantly in behavioral trouble -- in and out of the school 
system -- and come from the academically lowest-achieving school in our system. 
</P>
<P>
When I approached the school principal about this problem, the principal -- 
backed by the administration -- told us not to ask these students any questions 
about drugs or alcohol. He said, "These areas are personal, and parents won't 
like it. Besides, there are no drug or alcohol problems in our school." 
</P>
<P>
Do you have any suggestions on how to overcome these barriers? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: First, here are two givens: (1) Every school, every industry and every 
community has alcohol/drug problems. It's only a question of how extensive the 
problems are. (2) Clinically, adults and adolescents who have significant 
alcohol or drug problems also have trouble with their behavior and performance 
in school, at work or at play. 
</P>
<P>
Based on my clinical work with overseas schools as well as with public and 
private schools in this country, I would say that the principal and the 
administration in your town are playing politics, probably in order to protect 
their jobs. The more sinister possibility is that the principal in question has 
an alcohol/drug problem himself, or in his family. 
</P>
<P>
In my clinical experience I have found that in schools where alcohol/drug 
problems are rampant, one or more of the following situations exist: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Substance abuse problems among top officials of the school administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Widespread substance abuse among faculty members. (When I ask in such a 
school how many recovering alcohol/drug abusers there are among the school 
faculty, I get blank hostile stares, and the answer "zero." That tells me that 
the teachers who are addicts in that school are still sick.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- The school has no substance abuse program at all, or the program exists 
only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Your community is not unique. Recently the principal of a New York City public 
school was arrested while buying crack. He had been suspended three times 
before by the school board because of unexplained absences and late appearances 
at the school, but he had not been disciplined or removed. 
</P>
<P>
When the media printed a news story about the principal's arrest, New York 
City's school chancellor criticized the press and described his errant 
principal as "a principal who unfortunately made a bad decision about the use 
of crack." 
</P>
<P>
When the news caught the attention of Mayor Edward Koch, he ordered an 
investigation that revealed that the principal had become a troubled drinker 
about three years before and was often observed drunk and dozing at meetings; 
that he was late or absent 142 days out of 184 school days last year; that 
one-fourth of the teaching staff was regularly late or absent; and that the 
school's reading levels were among the lowest in the city, ranking 529th out of 
616 elementary schools last year. The principal has since enrolled in a drug 
treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done to overcome the problem in your community? As a professional, 
you have an obligation to treat your clients by using the latest effective, 
accepted techniques available. If you counsel troubled students, getting a 
drug/alcohol history, not only of your client but also of your client's family, 
is of utmost clinical importance. 
</P>
<P>
You must also discuss the school principal's advice with your own boss. If your 
boss sides with the principal, maybe your mayor will want to look further into 
this problem.

Violinist Frank Almond III suffers from a peculiar type of bicoastal 
schizophrenia. In New York City, he is the student; in San Diego, he is the 
teacher. While he is completing the final year of his Master's program at 
Juilliard in New York, he is also one of this year's Stauffer Visiting 
Professors in String Performance at San Diego State University. During the 
1988-89 academic year, Almond has made several visits to the SDSU campus to 
perform, give master classes to string players, and talk to classes about the 
music profession. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran San Diego prodigy watchers recall Almond as the local teen-ager who won 
third place at the Paganini Competition in Genoa, Italy, and as one of two 
American laureates in the 1986 Tchaikovsky International Violin Competition in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Almond was scheduled to perform last night as guest concertmaster for maestro 
Donald Barra's San Diego Chamber Orchestra. Regular concertmaster Igor Gruppman 
was busy with the San Diego Symphony string auditions, so Almond agreed to step 
in. This visit will also serve as a kind of trial -- for both parties -- should 
Gruppman's workload as the San Diego Symphony's concertmaster cause him to give 
up his chamber orchestra post. Almond displayed a decorous interest in the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real possibility. Their season is not so extensive that I would have to 
live here. If I could get along artistically and personally with Barra, I'm 
guardedly optimistic about the possibility," said Almond. 
</P>
<P>
While he is pursuing his solo career -- he will make his Boston debut later 
this week at the Gardiner Museum -- he is also keeping up his concertmaster 
chops. He is still the concertmaster of the Juilliard Orchestra, and this 
summer he did a stint as concertmaster of the Batiquitos Festival Orchestra for 
the first three weeks of that ill-fated North County venture. 
</P>
<P>
Although Almond counts himself as one of the few people hired by the festival 
who was actually paid his contractual fee, the former pupil of Batiquitos 
Festival director Michael Tseitlin admitted it was one of the most chaotic and 
ill-planned festivals he had ever encountered. And he confirmed that the 
festival's shoddy reputation spread to the East Coast almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Even as early as when I came back to play in the La Jolla SummerFest in 
August, the word was out. You can't involve that many well-known music people 
and not expect news like that to make the rounds." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his programming for the March 5 recital he will play at SDSU's 
Montezuma Hall, he promised to include some approachable contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that people are tired of the same old stuff. It's not 
smart, and it doesn't do anybody any good," said Almond. "I'll play a new piece 
I recorded a couple of years ago that everybody seems to like, called "Birds in 
Warped Time" by Somei Satoh. I gave the American premiere of it a couple of 
years ago, then recorded it. Everybody started buying the record and playing it 
all over the radio, and last month the New York Times put that disc on the 
critics' choice list." 
</P>
<P>
Since Almond grew up in San Diego, he is well aware of the challenges local 
classical music promoters face. His suggestion for a new San Diego festival 
aimed at a broader audience: an over-the-line chamber music festival, where 
concerts would be played in the evenings on Fiesta Island after the infamous 
ball games. 
</P>
<P>
Music of the Holocaust. The San Diego Jewish Community Center's College area 
branch will present a concert Feb. 5 featuring music written by four composers 
of the Terezin concentration camp. Pianist David Bloch of Tel Aviv's Rubin 
Music Academy and mezzo soprano Emile Berendsen will perform songs and chamber 
music that survived this infamous cultural ghetto -- also known as 
Theresienstadt -- an interim concentration camp set up by the Nazis just 
outside Prague where Jewish composers and artists worked before being sent to 
other camps for extermination. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the composers, Victor Ullman, was a pupil of Schoenberg," said local 
program organizer Eileen Wingard. "While in the camp he wrote some 25 works, 
and was even assigned to review concerts given there." 
</P>
<P>
Some of this music has survived, even though the composers did not, because it 
was saved by the composers' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Gideon Kline, whose Alban Berg-like piano sonata will be performed, is 
survived by a sister who lives and teaches in Prague. She saved his Terezin 
compositions," Wingard said. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to San Diego, Bloch and Berendsen will give the program in New 
York City. In San Diego, they will be assisted by three members of the San 
Diego Symphony -- violist Gary Syroid, cellist Karla Holland-Moritz and 
violinist Wingard. 
</P>
<P>
The program, part of the community center's music series, begins at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Just one rebate. When cellist Yo Yo Ma canceled his Symphony Hall recital last 
Tuesday, the staff of the sponsoring La Jolla Chamber Music Society worried 
about the number of people who might show up expecting to hear Ma and pianist 
Emmanuel Ax. After all, Ma's management had given but one day's notice of the 
cancellation, and the society had to scramble to get the word out. Out of the 
2200 ticket holders, only 44 showed up for the recital, and only one asked for 
a refund, according to the society's executive director Neale Perl. Perl is 
still searching for a date to reschedule the popular duo. 
</P>
<P>
Quartet winners. Winners of the San Diego State University high school and 
junior college string quartet competition, held the weekend of Jan. 21-22, are 
the Teller-Chappui Quartet of Los Angeles and a quartet from the local Academy 
of Strings. Each quartet received a $600 award, and the Grace Davis High School 
string quartet from Modesto was named runner-up. Members of the Lark Quartet, 
SDSU's resident string quartet, judged the contest.

Former members of Czechoslovakia's banned rock group, Plastic People of the 
Universe, joined U.S. musicians at a benefit concert Sunday in Manhattan for 
Ivan Martin Jirous, the group's manager and guiding light who was jailed in 
Prague last October after his public reading of a manifesto protesting human 
rights abuses in Czechoslovakia. The rock group has become a symbol of 
resistance in Czechoslovakia since its inception in 1968. Veteran members of 
avant-garde bands the Fugs and Captain Beefheart also took the stage Sunday 
with poets Allen Ginsberg and Ed Sanders, as films and slides from the banned 
group's 20-year history were projected. ALEENE MacMINN

Contract talks between the three major networks and the American Federation of 
Radio and Television Artists resume in New York today after a week's recess. 
AFTRA's previous contract expired Nov. 15, but is being extended on a 
day-to-day basis. The negotiations affect news anchors and reporters, daytime 
soap operas and game shows, late-night and morning programs, and on-air 
personnel at network-owned stations. Prime-time network programs are covered by 
a separate contract. "Some progress" is being made in the negotiations, an 
AFTRA spokesman said Monday, but he declined to give specifics. The talks 
between CBS, NBC and ABC and the union began Oct. 3. A majority of AFTRA 
members have given their representatives authority to call a strike. AFTRA last 
struck the networks in 1967. The union says it has 70,000 members and estimates 
that between 3,000 and 4,000 of them work at the networks. ALEENE MacMINN

Robin Williams and Kathleen Turner are due for some razzing as Harvard's Hasty 
Pudding Theatricals' man and woman of the year. The group called Turner ("The 
Accidental Tourist," "Body Heat," "Romancing the Stone" and "Peggy Sue Got 
Married") a "stellar and versatile actress whose combination of sass and 
glamour has defined her as a leading actress of our generation." She'll be 
honored Feb. 14 with a parade through Cambridge, Mass. Williams was cited as 
"probably the only actor who can claim to have portrayed a cartoon character, a 
real-life character and an alien" in his roles ("Popeye," "The World According 
to Garp," "Good Morning, Vietnam," "Mork &amp; Mindy"). He'll be honored Feb. 
21 at the premiere of "Whiskey Business," Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 141st 
annual musical. ALEENE MacMINN

"Citizen Kane" is headed for the paint pots. Color tests are under way on the 
1941 Orson Welles classic, heading it toward full colorization by Turner 
Entertainment Co. and American Film Technologies. The Directors Guild of 
America has been particularly vocal in protesting the colorizing of past film 
classics, and Elliot Silverstein, chairman of the DGA's President's Committee, 
says the coloring of "Citizen Kane" is "sickening . . . a gross representation" 
of Welles' work. He said the committee would check Welles' contract and if it 
shows he had the right of approval of cameraman, art director, costume 
directors and the like, the colorizing would be a violation of Welles' original 
contract and Turner Entertainment "would be in for some very serious trouble."

Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney reshuffled his Cabinet and announced 
organizational changes that signaled a new attack on the nation's $24-billion 
budget deficit. Mulroney, who led his Progressive Conservative Party to victory 
in November, announced the creation of four policy committees and a powerful 
expenditure panel to oversee spending. Mulroney also named six newcomers to the 
Cabinet and announced an extensive series of promotions and demotions. 
Mulroney's pro-business team, first elected in 1984, secured its second 
consecutive majority government in the November election after a campaign over 
free trade with the United States.

Britain confirmed that it will withdraw some troops from Gibraltar but denied 
it is abandoning the strategic area. Defense Secretary George Younger said the 
move is part of a cost-cutting drive and that the troops are needed elsewhere. 
He said Britain's commitment to the colony is "absolute and very clear. As long 
as the people of Gibraltar wish it, they will remain under the British flag." 
Government sources said that about 650 soldiers will be pulled out over two 
years' time. The garrison currently has about 1,700 troops.

James S. Brady, who remained on the government payroll as Ronald Reagan's press 
secretary for nearly eight years after being severely wounded in an 
assassination attempt, is retiring. White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said this week that President Bush talked with Brady's wife, Sarah, 
about the former press secretary's retirement plans before his inauguration. 
Brady, 48, who has held a variety of government jobs since coming to Washington 
in 1968 as a communications consultant to the House, is entitled to a 
government pension. He was shot in the head March 30, 1981, during an attempt 
on Reagan's life, and uses a wheelchair.

Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, defrocked last year after confessing to 
unspecified "sins" with a New Orleans prostitute, has been expelled from the 
National Religious Broadcasters, the group that represents about three-fourths 
of the nation's television ministries. The organization's directors, who said 
his "moral failure" and "confessed misconduct" were damaging to the group's 
interests, voted Swaggart out at their annual meeting in Washington. Meanwhile, 
Swaggart's lawyer threatened to sue Penthouse magazine for publishing a new 
account of sexual misconduct against the Baton Rouge, La., minister. The 
article claims Swaggart conned a New Orleans stripper into performing 
sadomasochistic acts while he watched, and that he asked her 13-year-old 
daughter to have sex with him.

A friend of a Marine who died when he was left behind in the Mojave Desert 
after a training exercise testified in Camp Lejeune, N.C., that he had asked 
about his friend's absence a day before he was reported missing. There was 
"total confusion" when Lance Cpl. Jason Rother was discovered missing, Lance 
Cpl. Kevin Robertson said at the court-martial of Rother's platoon sergeant. 
Sgt. Christopher Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying an 
order. Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, died after he was left at his post as a road 
guide at the end of a training exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing 
until nearly two days later and his remains were not found until Dec. 4.

Pakistani government officials are said to be proposing a swap that would send 
U.S.-made nuclear reactors to their country in exchange for safeguards to 
assure that the country's nuclear program is used only for peaceful purposes. 
Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian 
subcommittee, said such an agreement could head off a showdown later this year 
on a cutoff of U.S. aid to Pakistan over its failure to comply with nuclear 
non-proliferation requirements. "If the United States is willing to sell 
nuclear reactors for peaceful nuclear energy, Pakistan would agree to establish 
full-scope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities," said Solarz, who 
recently visited Pakistan.

The District of Columbia City Council, trying to stem the city's rising 
homicide rate, proposed making handgun manufacturers and sellers liable for 
injuries and deaths caused by those weapons. Sponsors of the legislation said 
it will be the first of its kind in the nation. "This legislation is designed 
to force gun manufacturers to consider carefully the purposes for which 
handguns are manufactured," said Council Chairman David Clarke, the bill's 
original sponsor. The bill, which would hold handgun manufacturers, importers 
and dealers liable for damage caused by handguns, is supported by 12 of the 13 
council members. Clarke predicted that pro-gun groups will try to block the 
measure in the House of Representatives, which reviews legislation from the 
council.

STATE FARM SETS 9.6% INCREASE IN AUTO RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Farm, the largest seller of auto insurance in California, Monday 
announced a general statewide auto policy rate increase averaging 9.6%. It thus 
became the first big company since the passage of Proposition 103 in November 
to raise its premiums across the board. 
</P>
<P>
The action was challenged by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who 
said she would call a public hearing to determine whether the increase is 
excessive and to find out precisely how State Farm is disbursing the dollars it 
collects from premiums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Cites Costs 
</P>
<P>
The company cited the rising cost of paying claims, saying it lost $124 for 
each car it insured in California in the 12 months that ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she has the authority under the state insurance code to order 
State Farm to reduce its premiums "by the excessive amount" if it is determined 
that the company is charging too much. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner expressed concern that State Farm's action, which 
affects 2.7 million vehicles, might be the first of many by the more than 400 
companies that sell auto insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are facing an uncertain market," she said in an interview, "and 
State Farm is the industry leader that many insurance companies tend to follow 
in raising their prices." 
</P>
<P>
State Farm said it would welcome a hearing. The company's vice president and 
general counsel, Pete Ingham, termed the rate increase fully justified by 
escalating claims since the company's last general auto insurance rate hike of 
7.9% in December, 1987. He said that opening the company's books "certainly is 
not troublesome to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ingham questioned, however, whether Gillespie actually has the authority to 
order a reduction of the announced rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Along with its announcement, State Farm provided statistics asserting that 
total claims payments and claims expenses per policy increased from $478.77 in 
1987 to $535.02 in 1988, that bodily-injury liability claims per 1,000 cars 
increased from 16.3 to 17.5 in a year and that average bodily-injury liability 
claims and uninsured-motorist claims also have continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said one purpose of the hearing would be to seek verification of such 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted in a way that State Farm is providing us with this 
opportunity," she said. "It's a very large carrier. This is an excellent 
opportunity to go through this process. And Harvey Rosenfield (chairman of the 
Proposition 103 campaign) has been saying he wants the books open." 
</P>
<P>
Provisions in Proposition 103 giving the insurance commissioner power to 
approve or reject insurance rate increases are not supposed to go into effect 
until Nov. 8, 1989, but Gillespie claims the authority to order a reduction of 
"excessive" premiums under existing insurance code provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, the Insurance Department hearing process has been a slow 
one, often with months elapsing before a decision is reached. 
</P>
<P>
When the state Supreme Court stayed Proposition 103's rate-rollback and 
rate-freeze provisions for a year, it created a loophole permitting companies 
to increase rates in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
It is this loophole that State Farm used Monday. Legislation has been proposed 
in Sacramento to freeze rates, but last week it was delayed in the Assembly 
Insurance Committee. In order to take effect immediately, the bill would have 
to be passed on an urgency basis, which requires a two-thirds majority. Faced 
with vigorous opposition from the insurance lobby, the bill's authors have 
expressed doubt that they have the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
A call for the Legislature to impose a freeze came Monday night in Costa Mesa 
from Proposition 103 backer Ralph Nader, who also criticized State Farm's rate 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Nader, making his first visit to the state since the election, said State Farm 
was behaving as "the leading hound dog for the rest of the industry to test the 
waters and see if they can resume business as usual -- arbitrary, unjustified 
rate increases." It is up to Gillespie, Gov. George Deukmejian and the 
Legislature, Nader said, to stick up for consumers and stop the increases. 
</P>
<P>
An official spokeswoman for the Proposition 103 campaign Monday called State 
Farm's announced rate increase outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"We think all rates ought to be justified to the insurance commissioner," 
Carmen Gonzalez said. "We think they ought to go through the review process set 
down in 103." 
</P>
<P>
A State Farm spokesman said, meanwhile, that should the state Supreme Court 
allow the 20% rollbacks from 1987 levels called for under Proposition 103 to go 
into effect, the company would be forced to refund all additional money it will 
collect from the new rate increase, plus granting the mandated rollbacks. The 
Supreme Court has accepted legal briefs but has yet to call for oral arguments 
in its review of Proposition 103's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
While disclosing the higher premiums, State Farm said it is discontinuing its 
post-election policy of selling to new customers at 20% higher rates than old 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The two-tier rate structure had been challenged by Gillespie, who, after weeks 
of delays, last week called a public hearing on the matter for March 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm said Monday that when policies expire for new customers who have 
come in at the higher rates since November, they will be able to renew at the 
same rates as old customers. 
</P>
<P>
But it did not say it would refund the extra money it has collected, and 
Gillespie said the March hearing would go forward, at least on the question of 
whether those refunds should be made. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm spokesmen said the new 9.6% rate increase will apply across 
territorial lines to all neighborhoods equally, but that some customers will 
get more than a 9.6% increase while others may get less. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, they explained, is that the rate increases are being posted only 
for coverages that pay for personal injury -- the liability and 
uninsured-motorist components of policies. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if a policyholder does not carry collision and comprehensive coverage, as 
is the case with many owners of older cars, he may get a rate increase of as 
much as 17%, one State Farm spokesman indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates announced by State Farm are effective for all renewal notices 
mailed beginning Jan. 30 and for new customers beginning with the same date, 
the company said.

CHINA-VIETNAM AGREEMENT ON CAMBODIA TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
China and Vietnam have agreed that Vietnam will withdraw its troops from 
Cambodia by September and China will end its aid to resistance forces there, 
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting for four hours with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Evans 
told reporters that the arrangement between the main backers of the opposing 
sides in the Cambodian conflict appears to be "watertight." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement apparently was reached during a mid-January visit to Beijing by 
Vice Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said Qian told him that China will end its aid to the resistance forces 
by September in return for the promised Vietnamese withdrawal. It is possible, 
he said, that the cutoff of Chinese aid will begin before September and be 
phased according to the pace of the Vietnamese pullout. Vietnam is estimated to 
have 100,000 troops in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
China has been the main military backer of the three-faction resistance 
coalition fighting the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government. The Khmer 
Rouge, which ruled Cambodia with a tyrannical and murderous regime from 1975 
until Vietnamese troops drove it from power in late 1978, is the strongest of 
the three factions and has received the greatest share of the Chinese military 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread international concern has focused in recent months on whether a 
Vietnamese pullout will lead to a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer 
Rouge forces, estimated to number 40,000, are reported to have large quantities 
of weapons and ammunition stockpiled in the Cambodian jungle, but a cutoff of 
Chinese military aid would nonetheless be a major step toward limiting their 
chances of resuming dictatorial power. 
</P>
<P>
Still, China continues to insist that the Khmer Rouge should be included in a 
four-party government of national reconciliation formed by the three resistance 
factions and the present government. China favors Prince Norodom Sihanouk, 
former ruler of Cambodia and head of one of the resistance factions, as the top 
leader of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that along with Vietnam's genuine and complete troop withdrawal 
from Cambodia, the four parties in Cambodia should reach national 
reconciliation and establish a provisional quadripartite coalition government 
of a transitional nature headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk to organize a future 
general election and make proper arrangement for the troops of each party," 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said at a press conference last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Li repeated China's longstanding position that no faction should be excluded 
from the government -- and that no faction should be allowed to monopolize 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"Only with a quadripartite coalition can civil war and turmoil be avoided," Li 
said. "This is not only in the interests of the Cambodian people, but also in 
the interests of Vietnam, Thailand and other neighboring countries, and 
represents the universal aspiration of the international community." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who conferred with officials in Hanoi earlier this month, said Monday 
that with the basic shape of a so-called external solution now decided, the 
focus of negotiations will shift to the search for an internal solution capable 
of reconciling the four Cambodian factions. 
</P>
<P>
He said Qian told him that Cambodia will be a major topic of discussion when 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze visits Beijing this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot of detailed discussions . . . about nuts and bolts (of a 
Cambodian settlement)," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Li said at last week's press conference that China feels "that all parties 
concerned should reach an agreement on the political settlement of the 
Cambodian issue first and then convene an international conference, so as to 
provide international guarantees for the implementation of the agreement and 
for the independence, neutrality and nonaligned status of Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will be willing to participate, along with other countries, 
in an effort to provide such international guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Bangkok, Thailand, the leaders of the three resistance factions 
said Monday that they will attend talks scheduled for Feb. 19-21 in Jakarta, 
Indonesia, aimed at settling the conflict, Reuters news service reported.

STATE HEADS FOR RARE 3RD STRAIGHT YEAR OF DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OROVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disappointingly dry January is pushing California toward a remarkable third 
consecutive year of drought, state water managers are saying as they survey 
shrunken reservoir levels and vanishing mountain snowpacks. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the state has not suffered three consecutive drought years 
in nearly 400 years. They base this belief both on recorded history and data 
extrapolated from growth rings on ancient trees. Narrow rings, showing little 
growth in a particular year, indicate drought. 
</P>
<P>
The current gloomy outlook arises because California's rainy season is more 
than half over, but its reservoirs are not half full. Despite bountiful snow 
for skiers, climatic conditions are such that the state is not getting enough 
runoff where it is needed -- in the Northern California hills that feed major 
reservoirs. Runoff has dipped to 47% of normal this year, managers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot of rainfall to bring us up to where we were last year, and 
last year was the second year of a drought," said William J. Helms, chief of 
the state drought center in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Official drought watchers have said the state would require at least 70% of 
normal capacity in every major reservoir as well as an above-average snowpack 
before the Department of Water Resources could even consider calling an end to 
the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said there is only a 50% chance that February and March will be 
sufficient to obviate plans for significant mandatory rationing. Farmers 
already have been told to expect 40% less irrigation water this year, and urban 
water agencies are being urged to redouble their conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has its own independent 
sources of water from the eastern Sierra, is in no better shape, said spokesman 
Jim Wickser. The snowpack on which it depends is only 70% of normal for this 
time of year and would need to be close to 150% of normal through March to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be looking for mandatory conservation in the city of Los Angeles 
if things do not improve," Wickser said. Voluntary conservation programs in use 
now will not save enough water to make a difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As bad as the situation is, Helms said the state's water situation is not yet 
as desperate as it was during the 1976-77 drought. He said this is because 
several new reservoirs have been added in the last decade and water management 
and conservation practices have improved. 
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that a third year of drought now could again prove a 
problem. Ironically, Northern California cities would be most dramatically 
affected because they rely much more on runoff from the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
With two months remaining in the rainy season, Helms and Libby are hopeful that 
the state can recoup its usual water reserves, but figures show precipitation 
through the end of the seven-month rainy season in April would have to be 130% 
of normal to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Dave Beusterien of WeatherData Inc., which supplies forecasts to 
The Times, said Monday that changes in the jet stream should bring above-normal 
precipitation to Central and Northern California in the next two weeks, but 
probably not 130% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
On the land feeding Lake Oroville, the largest State Water Project reservoir, 
only 13.46 inches of rain, about 24% less than usual, has fallen so far this 
season. Much of what did fall was soaked up by desiccated mountain soils before 
reaching the lake. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the lake, already sapped by two years of drought, now holds less 
than half its capacity and about 69% of its average historical volume for this 
time of year. Other lakes are faring even worse. Federally managed Lake Shasta, 
California's largest reservoir, has only 40% of capacity, while Folsom Lake 
near Sacramento contains only 30%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservoirs Are Crucial 
</P>
<P>
These reservoirs and others in the northern third of California are critical 
because they represent the bulk of the state's storage capacity of surface 
water. Central California has far fewer facilities to help it through the 
summer and Southern California has fewer still. Both regions rely on northern 
water sent south through managed rivers and aqueducts. 
</P>
<P>
This year's lack of runoff is no more evident than at Lake Oroville, where 
water operations manager Ronald M. Libby can drive his pickup across acres of 
dry, red clay lake bed to oversee work crews repairing floats and other gear 
that have been beached by the receding water. 
</P>
<P>
The tree line ringing the reservoir, and demarcating the normal high-water 
mark, looms 150 feet above the lake level. Boat ramps barely stretch to the 
lake surface and several abandoned cars have been exposed on the sloping sides 
of the reservoir after years of quiet submersion. 
</P>
<P>
Enough snow has blanketed the Sierra Nevada to delight skiers this winter, but 
the snowpack is proving a disappointment to water officials for a number of 
reasons. It is so fluffy that it has a below-average water content, and without 
replenishment it has slowly been shrinking -- from 115% of normal at the start 
of the month to 90% last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Each snowless day it drops another percentage point," Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
As it melts, however, it does not benefit the reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of snow up there, but it's all fallen on a sponge," Libby said, 
referring to dry soils. "What little has melted so far has soaked right into 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEASURING THE DROUGHT 
</P>
<P>
Disappointing precipitation in the first half of California's rainy season has 
left water levels so low at drought-starved Lake Oroville, above, that service 
boats are dwarfed by the exposed, sloping lake bed. Water level is 150 feet 
below capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Water managers measure the severity of California droughts by the amount of 
water in remote Northern California reservoirs like Oroville. Rainfall in 
cities is less important because cities lack storage systems large enough to 
carry them through dry summers. Storage at 70% of historical average in all 
reservoirs is needed to avoid shortages. These storage data for selected 
reservoirs in California are as of Jan. 24; all figures are expressed in 
acre-feet, a standard water measurement equal to 325,800 gallons.

A 'CLOSET SOCIALIST' STIRS FUROR OVER NEWS STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In December, 1971, having told his editor at the Wall Street Journal that he 
was leaving the paper after a decade as a reporter there, A. Kent MacDougall 
sent this message to all Journal bureaus over the newspaper's internal wire 
network: 
</P>
<P>
"On January 7, after ten years and three months of . . . peonage, I will be 
free at last, free at last, great gawd almighty, free at last. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Journal editors were furious with MacDougall over that message, but they're 
even angrier at him now for writing another, much longer and more controversial 
message, this one published in a small socialist magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-part article for Monthly Review, MacDougall, 57 -- who also worked for 
the Los Angeles Times for 10 years and is now on sabbatical from his job as a 
professor of journalism at UC Berkeley -- says he has long been a "closet 
socialist" who used the news pages of "the bourgeois press" to "popularize 
radical ideas." 
</P>
<P>
He also says he wrote more than 30 "major articles" under different pseudonyms 
for various radical publications while at the Passaic, N.J., Herald-News and 
during his first six months at the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall's 9,000-word Monthly Review story has sparked a contretemps in the 
mainstream journalistic community -- which prides itself on not letting 
ideology color its news coverage -- and has been seized upon by some 
conservatives as proof that the press has a liberal bias. 
</P>
<P>
Journal officials were so upset by MacDougall's comments that they issued a 
statement saying they were "offended and outraged," and editors at both the 
Journal and The Times said MacDougall greatly "exaggerated" and "romanticized" 
his attempts to subvert their publications. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall's former editors say his stories for The Times and the Journal met 
both papers' professional standards of accuracy and fairness. Their judgment is 
largely confirmed by a careful, independent reading of all the stories 
MacDougall cited in Monthly Review. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall himself now concedes that "99% of what I wrote (for the Journal and 
The Times) had absolutely no ideological content at all." When he did write 
stories in which ideology could have played a role, MacDougall now says, he 
wrote them according to proper journalistic standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that the somewhat brash language and the tone of the opening of the 
piece was misconstrued as my bragging about having been a media mole with a 
secret mission to push Marxist propaganda past my editors, on to unsuspecting 
readers," he said. "That was in no way my intent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viewed as Proof 
</P>
<P>
But conservatives who have long complained that "news presentation by the media 
elite is heavily biased in favor of liberal views and attitudes," as William 
Rusher, former publisher of National Review, argued in a book last year, have 
welcomed MacDougall's Monthly Review article as proof of their charges. 
</P>
<P>
"With MacDougall's revelations, it will be harder . . . to dismiss evidence of 
news bias at the Journal and other publications," Cliff Kincaid, director of 
media analysis for Accuracy in Media, wrote in the Dec. 24 issue of Human 
Events. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy in Media is a conservative watchdog of the media, and Human Events -- 
like National Review -- is a conservative magazine. Monthly Review (circulation 
7,000) bills itself as "an independent socialist magazine." MacDougall -- who 
says in the Monthly Review that "Karl Marx (may be) my all-time favorite 
journalist" -- is clearly upset that he has given journalistic aid and 
political comfort to those he perceives as the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
He regrets, he said in an interview, that he has embarrassed his Journal and 
Times editors and that he has "provided some ammunition to humorless right-wing 
media monitors to try to make the case that the Establishment press is allowing 
left-leaning reporters to run off on anti-Establishment tirades." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall worked for the Journal from 1961 to 1972 -- spending much of his 
time writing about the press. He was a business reporter for The Times from 
1977 to 1987. Before that, he worked for five years at the Passaic Herald-News. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining academic tenure gave him "the luxury of coming out of the ideological 
closet at last," MacDougall said, but he insisted that his Monthly Review story 
(titled "Boring From Within the Bourgeois Press") had been "misconstrued." He 
said he had been "a journalist first and a radical second throughout my career. 
. . . I stuck to accepted standards of newsworthiness, accuracy and fairness 
(in my stories)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adhered to Standards 
</P>
<P>
Editors at both The Times and the Journal were quick to agree that MacDougall 
had, indeed, adhered to their professional standards. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reviewed articles he wrote while at the Journal and we believe our 
editing process succeeded in making sure that what appeared in print under his 
byline met Journal standards of accuracy, newsworthiness and fairness," the 
Journal said in its official statement. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gartner, who edited and rewrote many of MacDougall's articles for the 
Journal, said: "I always assumed his politics were quite liberal, but I don't 
think it affected his reporting one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I judge journalists by one thing -- whether they are fair, thorough and 
accurate," said Gartner, former Page 1 editor of the Journal and now president 
of NBC News. By those standards, Gartner said, MacDougall was an "A+ reporter . 
. . an outstanding reporter." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall's editors at The Times offered similar appraisals and assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who talked to him knew he was on the left side of the spectrum," said 
William F. Thomas, editor of The Times from 1971 until retiring Jan. 1. 
"Nevertheless, he met every journalistic standard. . . . He was a 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall, who won several journalism awards and whose work was several times 
entered for a Pulitzer Prize, writes in the Monthly Review that "reconciling 
radicalism and reporting for the mass media came naturally" to him as the son 
of Curtis D. MacDougall, a journalist and political activist who ran as the 
Progressive Party candidate for U.S. senator from Illinois in 1948. The elder 
MacDougall was also a longtime professor of journalism at Northwestern 
University, where he taught Thomas, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas lived with the MacDougall family for six months as an undergraduate but 
he said he didn't realize that Kent MacDougall was his former professor's son 
until after MacDougall came to work at The Times. He was hired at Thomas' 
urging because Thomas had been impressed with his "remarkably sensible and 
professional voice" in stories for the Journal and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said MacDougall is now "romanticizing his role . . . hallucinating a 
little bit" about having tricked his editors into publishing Marxist 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Steiger, deputy managing editor of the Journal and former business editor 
of The Times, said MacDougall is "much more a secret agent in his own mind than 
he was in reality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong for someone . . . in our profession (to) have as a motive the 
intent to subvert the process," Steiger said, "but if you look at what appeared 
(under MacDougall's byline) in either paper, for the most part, it was pretty 
straightforward journalism." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall said he "deeply respects" The Times and the Journal and wrote his 
Monthly Review stories in part "to disabuse radicals of the notion that press 
lords get together in some hotel room and conspire to keep information 
embarrassing to the Establishment out of the Establishment press. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to demonstrate that a good reporter, who got his facts right and who 
worked for good papers, could get . . . a lot more stuff into print than 
radicals would suppose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall now says that in his "over-exuberance at bursting out of the 
ideological closet" and "to grab the attention of radicals who didn't know who 
I was . . . I got kind of carried away," using an unintentionally "boastful . . 
. tone" and some "infelicitously worded" phrases. 
</P>
<P>
He says he realizes he was "naive" to have thought his stories in the Monthly 
Review would be read only by "old lefties." 
</P>
<P>
In the Monthly Review, MacDougall wrote that as a reporter for The Times and 
the Journal, he had: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Helped popularize radical ideas with lengthy, sympathetic profiles of 
Marxist economists. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Exposed the simplistic, jingoistic editorial policies of such leading 
retrogressive periodicals as the New York Daily News, Time magazine and the 
Reader's Digest." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Made sure to seek out experts whose opinions I knew in advance would 
support my thesis." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Sought out mainstream authorities to confer recognition and respectability 
on radical views I sought to popularize." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Bizarre' 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Journal said it was "bizarre and troubling that any man 
who brags of having sought to push a personal political agenda on unsuspecting 
editors and readers should be teaching journalism at a respected university." 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Goldstein, dean of the graduate school of journalism at UC Berkeley and 
himself a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal, praised MacDougall as a 
"fine reporter" and a "splendid teacher." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no ideological litmus test at this school," Goldstein said. "Kent 
MacDougall's personal beliefs are his, not ours, and he scrupulously keeps 
ideology out of the classroom." MacDougall also insisted he doesn't proselytize 
his students. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with a half-dozen students who have taken classes from MacDougall at 
UC Berkeley tended to confirm this. All praised him as a good, demanding 
teacher and "tough editor," and most said his ideology, though apparent, wasn't 
forced on them and did not appear to intrude on his teaching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong Opinions' 
</P>
<P>
One student, Brian Doherty, said: "It's clear that he had strong opinions about 
certain things in society, but he never tried to drill into our minds that this 
was . . . the only way to look at things. He was always a great promoter of 
diversity in thought." 
</P>
<P>
Editors for whom MacDougall worked at The Times and the Journal also invoked 
the word "diversity" in explaining his value to their newspapers. A newspaper 
is supposed to be a marketplace of competing and conflicting ideas, they said, 
and the more diversity a newspaper staff has, the better it can serve a diverse 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Taylor, managing editor of the Journal during MacDougall's last two 
years there, said he was "delighted" to publish MacDougall's stories on radical 
economists and historians because they were stories that "Journal readers 
certainly ought to see and know about." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall undoubtedly chose to write about some subjects and not others 
because of his socialist views, but other, more conservative reporters chose 
other, more conservative subjects for similar reasons, his editors said. As 
long as all stories pass the same standards of accuracy, fairness and reader 
interest, the editors said, the public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while MacDougall wrote a profile of journalist I. F. Stone on the left, 
other reporters have profiled George Will and William F. Buckley on the right. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, editors -- not reporters -- put stories in the newspaper, and at the 
Wall Street Journal, in particular, stories are heavily edited. When MacDougall 
was at the Journal, most Page 1 stories -- including many of MacDougall's -- 
were thoroughly rewritten by a special Page 1 staff, and editors say that any 
bias would have been eliminated in this process. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall has always been a much better reporter than writer, and even he 
admits that one major problem with his Monthly Review article was that "no one 
edited it." 
</P>
<P>
When MacDougall was at The Times, his editor was generally John Lawrence, then 
the paper's assistant managing editor for economic affairs and now a 
contributing editor at Fortune magazine. Lawrence says he knew of MacDougall's 
political views and "looked at his stories accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence says he wouldn't have permitted MacDougall to write about a Marxist 
economist "if I'd known that he was . . . as strong a proponent . . . as he now 
claims to have been," but Lawrence also says ideological bias "was not a major 
problem" in MacDougall's stories. When "hints of bias" did appear, he says, 
they were "edited out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Balanced Stories 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the Monthly Review, MacDougall cited several examples of Times 
editors eliminating ideologically loaded phrases from his stories, and he also 
cited instances in which Times editors forced him to present a more balanced 
story than he had originally written. 
</P>
<P>
When he wrote a series for The Times in 1984 on the widening gap between the 
rich and the poor, MacDougall said in the Monthly Review, he had a "difficult" 
time with his editor. He was told to eliminate and change many passages and 
even after he had "balanced and sanitized the . . . series to what I thought 
would be my editor's satisfaction, he still found passages not fit for print." 
</P>
<P>
In his Monthly Review account of the occasional stories on radical subjects 
that he wrote for the Journal and The Times, MacDougall neglected to point out 
that even those stories were not propagandistic. 
</P>
<P>
Although MacDougall boasted in Monthly Review of having "introduced Journal 
readers to the ideas of . . . the left-wing journalist I. F. Stone," he didn't 
point out that his story on Stone also said that some "respected people" in 
Washington, liberals and conservatives, said Stone is "simply wrong on most 
counts," that he has no impact and that he is the victim of a "manic obsession 
against the use of power. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall has written a shorter version of his Monthly Review story for a 
forthcoming issue of the Columbia Journalism Review, and in that version, he 
says, "some of the flamboyant language (of the original) is toned down," and "I 
make it clear that I didn't try to get propaganda past my editors." 
</P>
<P>
But MacDougall does not recant either his radical views or his conviction that 
being a radical, "rather than interfering with the professional performance of 
my job . . . actually helped make me a better reporter." 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall says he has never been a member of any radical, socialist or 
communist organization and that his "radical perspective" made him a "true 
outsider and a skeptic," a reporter able and willing to "question who benefits 
from any government policy (or) practice . . . who controls things." 
</P>
<P>
"I think capitalist newspapers could do themselves -- and capitalism -- a favor 
by actively recruiting radical reporters and putting them to work examining the 
structural causes of poverty, racism, sexism, environmental degradation and 
other ills," he wrote in the Monthly Review. 
</P>
<P>
MacDougall's radical political views probably wouldn't arouse much controversy 
were he a journalist or a professor in Europe or in several other areas of the 
world where there is a long and legitimate tradition of intellectual Marxist 
criticism and where even the mainstream press is more ideological. But most of 
the mainstream American press, at least for the past generation or so, have 
prided themselves on being non-ideological, and the political spectrum in this 
country has always been far narrower than in many other countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arouses Suspicion 
</P>
<P>
The Left, as it is known in Europe and elsewhere, barely exists in the United 
States, and since the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s in particular, 
anything that even smacks of Marxism arouses suspicion and hostility in many 
quarters here. 
</P>
<P>
Although MacDougall's editors at The Times and the Journal scoff at his claims 
to have subverted their publications, they are less sanguine about his having 
written pseudonymously for socialist and radical publications while working for 
the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's dishonest as hell, terribly unethical," says Taylor, the former Journal 
managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who retired from the Journal in 1986 and now publishes a monthly 
newspaper in Oregon, says that if he had known about the pseudonymous articles 
at the time, MacDougall would have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, MacDougall writes in his Monthly Review series, he stopped writing 
for leftist publications within six months of joining the Journal, because he 
did not have time to do the "original reporting" for them that he deemed 
necessary once he had "internalized the standards and methodology of the most 
meticulous member of the capitalist press." 
</P>
<P>
Having been exposed to the Journal's "fastidiousness about facts," MacDougall 
wrote, he was no longer willing to "do less than my best possible work for the 
socialist press." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, among others, seemed amused by that admission. 
</P>
<P>
"You could make an argument -- I won't make it -- but you could make an 
argument that the Journal made an honest man of him," Taylor said.

Some nursing homes will have to strengthen their health care services and meet 
other higher standards of care to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid 
reimbursement under new regulations. They will also have to give residents more 
rights, including the right to refuse treatment and to manage their own money. 
The final rules were drafted in response to a law enacted by Congress in 1987 
and reflect responses to proposed regulations published in October, 1987. The 
final regulations will apply to nearly 15,000 long-term care facilities.

A car bomb exploded in Christian East Beirut on Monday, killing three people, 
wounding 17 others and spraying shrapnel into the motorcade of a senior 
Christian official who escaped unharmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred as George Saadeh, the head of the Falangist Party, Lebanon's 
main Christian organization, was riding by in his bullet-proof car. 
</P>
<P>
Saadeh's car and his two-vehicle escort were hit by flying shrapnel but he was 
unharmed, police said. Two of his bodyguards were reportedly among the wounded. 
It was not immediately known who was responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Christian leader, who is also a member of Lebanon's Parliament, 
later told reporters that he did not believe it was an assassination attempt 
because "the route I took . . . is not the road I usually take to my office. . 
. . I decided only minutes before leaving my house to take this route." 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, rival Shiite Muslim militias signed a truce aimed at ending a 
bloody, nine-month struggle for power in southern Lebanon that has claimed 500 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah 
reached agreement after talks in the Syrian capital between Iranian Foreign 
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Syrian counterpart, Farouk Shareh.

KOHL CITES 'ANXIETY OF PEOPLE' IN W. BERLIN ELECTION DEFEAT

<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday blamed the "anxiety of the people" 
for his party's defeat in Sunday's West Berlin election and the strong showing 
of the Republicans, an extremist right-wing party. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl conceded that the election was a bitter defeat and "a clear warning signal 
to all of us." His Christian Democratic Party lost 12 of the 67 seats it had 
controlled in the West Berlin state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of demonstrators chanting "Nazis out!" marched through West Berlin 
protesting the Republican showing: 7.5% of the vote and 11 of the 138 seats in 
the state legislature, as well as two seats in the federal Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taunting Banner 
</P>
<P>
A banner carried by some of the marchers referred to Germany's Nazi past by 
asking: "Nothing Learned?" Monday was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's rise to 
power in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with reporters, Kohl blamed himself for the election results, which 
produced no clear winner and left unresolved the matter of who is to govern 
West Berlin. He said the voting was influenced by controversial reforms in 
health and welfare undertaken by the national government. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside Kohl was the mayor of West Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, who said his 
Christian Democrats will not cooperate with the Republicans, whose national 
leader is a former officer of the elite Nazi SS corps, or with the Alternative 
List, the Berlin version of the radical Greens. 
</P>
<P>
Diepgen said the Christian Democrats are still the strongest political party in 
West Berlin. On the basis of nearly complete official returns, the Christian 
Democrats received 37.5% of the vote to the Social Democrats' 37.3%. The two 
parties will each have 55 seats in the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats' partner in the present coalition city government, the 
Free Democrats, were wiped out of state politics by Sunday's results. They 
failed to receive 5% of the vote, the minimum necessary for representation in 
the Berlin legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts said the Christian Democrats might now seek to form a 
"grand coalition" with the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans claim 8,500 members nationwide, most of them in Bavaria. This 
was their first appearance on the ballot in the city-state of West Berlin, and 
their success surprised political commentators in the old German capital. Heinz 
Galinski, leader of the Central Jewish Community of Germany, called the results 
"a deep loss for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Galinski said the Republicans may now repeat their success in other parts of 
the country, and somehow, he said, "the democratic parties must avoid this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jewish Group Protests 
</P>
<P>
Adass Jisroel, a Jewish organization in West Berlin, said the Republicans' 
showing demonstrates that "nationalist and racist ideologies still have a real 
chance in Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans were led in the Berlin election by Bernhard Andres, 37, a 
motorcycle police officer who said his party is not extremist. He said it 
represents "German values such as cleanliness and punctuality." 
</P>
<P>
Franz Schoenhuber, 66, the former Nazi SS officer who is the Republicans' 
national chairman, said the party emphasizes law and order. Germans, he said, 
"have shown again the need for a democratically purified patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign he had called for the expulsion of Turks and other 
foreign nationals from West Berlin. There are about 150,000 Turks in the city. 
Altogether, foreigners make up about 10% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber joined the SS in 1942, at the age of 19, and fought with an SS unit 
in France and on the Russian front.

U.S. PROBERS CHARGE 2 IN SALE OF POISON GAS INGREDIENT 
</P>

<P>
American investigators, in a crackdown on U.S. exporters who supply chemical 
weapons components to Third World countries, on Monday charged a New Jersey man 
and a Dutch businessman with seven criminal counts each for allegedly selling 
thiodiglycol, a major ingredient of mustard gas, to Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Breckinridge L. Willcox also announced that Alcolac International 
Inc., a Baltimore manufacturer of the chemical, will plead guilty to violating 
a U.S. export law by knowingly selling the restricted substance to a foreign 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctions Being Considered 
</P>
<P>
In all, investigators believe that 90 tons of the thiodiglycol produced by 
Alcolac -- enough to make about 90 tons of mustard gas when mixed with 
hydrochloric acid -- reached Iran. As many as four shipments of the stuff, more 
than 500 tons, are believed to have reached Iraq by surface routes after having 
been illegally taken to Jordan in shipments orchestrated by the two men, 
Willcox said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Iraq are widely believed to have used chemical weapons against 
each other and, in the case of Iraq, against its own population, during their 
eight-year Persian Gulf War, which ended with a truce last August. Accounts of 
their chemical use -- and more recent evidence that Libya has built a chemical 
weapons plant -- have prompted Congress to consider sanctions against countries 
that try to develop the weapons and foreign companies that assist them in doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore case offers the first indication that Iran and Iraq may have 
relied on the cooperation of American firms to help produce their stocks of the 
poisonous gas. American officials in recent months have been critical of West 
Germany, whose relatively lax export policies enabled that nation's firms to 
sell Third World countries technology, hardware and chemicals that plants 
needed in the production of poison gas weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The message we want to deliver to exporters is that U.S. companies cannot 
continue to sell anything to anybody for any price, without asking any 
questions," said Donald G. Turnbaugh, a special agent of the U.S. Customs 
Service and one of the case's principal investigators. "Hopefully a case of 
this size will demonstrate that." 
</P>
<P>
In outlining the charges against Nicholas J. Defino, an executive of the United 
Steel and Strip Corp. of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Dutch businessman Franz Van 
Anraat, Willcox described the use of "fraudulent . . . shippers' export 
declarations, phony destinations, circuitous routing and sham companies." 
</P>
<P>
Defino, a New Jersey resident who ordered shipments of thiodiglycol from 
Alcolac for export, is described in court papers as a "principal" of the New 
York-based Nu Kraft Mercantile Corp., for which no incorporation papers or 
industrial listings appear to exist. Nu Kraft "is affiliated" with the United 
Steel and Strip Corp., according to documents released by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
All the shipments appear to have occurred between March, 1987, and April, 1988, 
the final year of desperate fighting between the two Persian Gulf adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Defino surrendered Sunday to authorities in Baltimore and was released on 
$100,000 bail Monday. Van Anraat was arrested in Italy on Jan. 26 and is 
expected to be extradited to the United States. Under the terms of the plea 
agreement, Alcolac is expected to pay fines of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Alcolac, whose officials said that the chemicals were sent to the Middle East 
without their knowledge, will cooperate with a continuing grand jury 
investigation into the sale of chemical weapons components to Mideast 
countries, Willcox added. Authorities said that they expect to bring additional 
charges against individuals and firms as their investigation widens.

QUAYLE SAYS SOVIET 'HATRED OF GOD' CAUSES MUCH OF WORLD'S EVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hatred of God" is the fundamental cause of "much evil" propagated by the 
Soviet Union throughout the world, Vice President Dan Quayle told a convention 
of religious broadcasters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that Americans must "be realists" about the extent of change in the 
Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Quayle said that official 
atheism has doomed the Soviet state from its earliest days to a system that 
denies human freedom and "proclaims that even in the most intimate recesses of 
the human soul, the will of the state must reign supreme." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's remarks -- reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's one-time denunciation of the 
Soviet Union as an "evil empire" -- were the harshest criticism of the Soviet 
system heard from official Washington since Gorbachev ascended to the 
leadership in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Words Have Harder Edge 
</P>
<P>
Quayle coupled his remarks with a statement implying some doubt about current 
U.S. plans to attend a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991. He did not 
directly contradict recent Administration statements on that subject, but his 
words did have a notably harder tone. 
</P>
<P>
A Quayle aide confirmed that the remarks were intended to send a signal. 
Prominent conservatives outside the Bush Administration have said they are 
looking to Quayle to advocate their positions on such issues. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reassure them, Quayle is positioning himself "a little more" to the 
right of Bush on U.S.-Soviet relations, the aide said, just as Bush "positioned 
himself to the right of Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Quayle said, "must continue to advance the cause of 
democracy and human rights at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
"Here at home," he added, "we must ensure that all the First Amendment freedoms 
. . . are accorded their just and proper due." That defense of freedom, he 
said, will be the message of the trip he will take later this week to El 
Salvador and to Venezuela, where he will attend the inauguration of that 
country's new president, Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, however, Quayle aides announced that journalists from most of the 
nation's major media outlets will not be allowed to accompany Quayle on the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Although journalists covering such trips pay the full cost of their travel, 
Quayle press secretary David Beckwith cited the cost in announcing Monday that 
only three of the more than 40 newspaper and television correspondents who had 
planned to follow Quayle will be allowed to go. The trip will be the first 
official assignment for Quayle, whom Bush aides often tried to shield from 
extensive press coverage during the fall presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's attack on the Soviets closely paralleled Reagan's 1983 "evil empire" 
speech. Both speeches were delivered before a conservative religious audience 
-- the National Assn. of Evangelicals in Reagan's case, the annual National 
Religious Broadcasters' convention for Quayle's speech -- and both cited the 
Soviets as not only a powerful adversary but as a world center of "evil." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle talked of the religious beliefs that inspired many of America's Founding 
Fathers and contrasted them with Soviet state founder V. I. Lenin who, Quayle 
claimed, once said that "every religious idea" and "every idea of God, even 
flirting with the idea of God, is unutterable vileness." 
</P>
<P>
"Look how much good has come into the world as a result" of the American 
Revolution "and how much evil has entered the world because of" the Russian 
Revolution, he said. Reagan, similarly, in 1983 had called the Soviets "the 
focus of evil in the modern world." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, however, seemed to change his views markedly in the last few years in 
response to Gorbachev's policies. That shift was dramatized on Jan. 4 when 
Reagan announced that the United States would attend the 1991 international 
human rights conference in Moscow, a major foreign policy objective for the 
Soviets, unless human rights conditions deteriorate there in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have said that the United 
States would abide by that decision. Quayle, striking a tougher rhetorical 
note, said that "if there is to be a human rights conference," the Soviets 
"must" meet the appropriate conditions.

ANOTHER POLISH DISSIDENT PRIEST IS FOUND DEAD

A radical pro-Solidarity priest in the northeastern Polish city of Bialystok 
was found dead Monday, the second dissident priest to die in Poland in the last 
10 days, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Father Stanislaw Suchowolec, 30, was apparently asphyxiated by a 
fire in his apartment. Neighbors alarmed by the smoke smashed their way into 
the apartment in his parish house and found him and his pet dog dead on the 
floor beside his bed. 
</P>
<P>
Suchowolec acted as a chaplain for the banned Solidarity movement in the 
Bialystok region. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said state authorities had raised his activities as a sore 
point at talks aimed at improving relations between them. 
</P>
<P>
Suchowolec also said a monthly patriotic "Mass for the Homeland" in Bialystok 
attended by anti-Communists and Solidarity supporters and supplied information 
to Solidarity's national Intervention Commission, a human rights watchdog 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Father Stefan Niedzielak, a 74-year-old Warsaw priest who made his church a 
shrine for Poles killed in the Soviet Union, was found dead in his apartment on 
Jan. 21. A lawyer said he was apparently killed by a karate blow. 
</P>
<P>
Father Cezary Potocki, a senior Bialystok church official, said the nature and 
cause of the fire that killed Suchowolec were not immediately clear but police 
were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said that both Niedzielak and Suchowolec were on a list of 
more than 150 priests considered extremists by Poland's Communist authorities. 
Both received anonymous threats and Suchowolec at times traveled with 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
After Niedzielak's funeral on Thursday, demonstrators marched to the tomb of 
Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity priest kidnaped and murdered by security 
police in 1984, shouting, "Stop killing our priests!" 
</P>
<P>
Warsaw police have issued contradictory statements about Niedzielak's death, 
declining to confirm it was murder.

U.S. AID IS NOT MISUSED, CONTRA LEADER CALERO SAYS

<P>
Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero angrily denied Monday that he has misused 
any U.S. aid funds and said that allegations of financial improprieties by the 
Contras are false. 
</P>
<P>
"These allegations of mismanaging funds -- I say this is false and defamatory," 
Calero said at a news conference in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never managed any money (from) the government of the United States," he 
said. "This money has always been managed in an institutional way. . . . No one 
individual can decide on the use or diversion of these funds." 
</P>
<P>
Calero and other Contra leaders also denied a report that the CIA has begun a 
special audit of the Contras' use of a secret U.S. political aid fund. 
</P>
<P>
"The finances of the resistance are not undergoing investigation, as has been 
reported," the Contra leaders said in a formal statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Officials Quoted 
</P>
<P>
A report that the CIA has begun an audit of the covert political fund was 
published in The Times on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The article quoted U.S. officials as saying that Calero was one of several 
targets of the inquiry but that the audit was aimed at the Contra movement as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official Monday reconfirmed the existence of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
The audit is examining a covert program of political aid that supports the 
rebels' organizational and political work throughout Central America, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras said that the U.S. government had completed an audit of their 
finances in the second week of January. They said no improprieties were found. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials refused to comment on the audit's findings, or to say whether 
the inquiry has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
A Contra official said the rebels are currently receiving $400,000 a month in 
political aid from the CIA. He said the aid had been cut back from $500,000 a 
month some time last year. 
</P>
<P>
He said Contra leaders are given a daily allowance of $60 each for lodging and 
other expenses when they are traveling on official business, in addition to air 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
Calero said that a Contra financial manager oversees the fund and that the 
Contras' own internal auditors review the use of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have audits by the U.S. government that have been going on constantly 
since we began receiving funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The story in The Times said that Calero's rivals have previously charged that 
he misused official funds, but the story reported that these rivals have 
provided no evidence to back up their allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Calero angrily denounced the report. 
</P>
<P>
"It is false, it is defamatory, and I am going to proceed legally if I don't 
get thorough satisfaction from the Los Angeles Times," Calero said. "I am sick 
and tired of having these allegations that have never been proven, that have 
just smeared my reputation," he said.

The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts resigned Monday after months of allegations 
that he had used his office as a political tool and had lied about his 
predecessor's smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"The work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked by any 
controversy," Frank L. McNamara Jr. said. He added that he felt President Bush 
and the attorney general "should be afforded the opportunity to appoint a 
person of their own choosing." 
</P>
<P>
McNamara's brief statement, which said he was returning to private law 
practice, did not mention a Justice Department investigation into conduct by 
him that staff members said had hindered the office's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sharkey, McNamara's first assistant, became interim head of the office 
after the resignation. But he said the Justice Department, which is continuing 
its investigation, appointed Jeremiah O'Sullivan, head of the New England 
Organized Crime Strike Force, to be the office's interim chief beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Republican has been the target of the investigation since

Investigators found no evidence to support the allegations, but McNamara 
admitted smoking marijuana himself.

Additional inquiries questioned whether several investigations McNamara pursued 
were politically motivated.

CONTROVERSIAL FEE STILL AN OPTION; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH MESSAGE TO CONGRESS MAY LACK PLAN FOR THRIFTS

President Bush, embroiled in a furor over a controversial savings tax option, 
may not be ready to present a specific plan for dealing with the nation's 
savings and loan crisis in the budget message he delivers to Congress next 
week, the White House said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has not yet received drafts on any of the options being prepared by 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady for a thrift industry rescue, White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
However, one senior White House official, referring to the cost of resolving 
the problem, predicted: "The taxpayers are going to take a hit, one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
And expressing pique at congressional opposition to the savings fee proposal, 
he added: "All those people are up there dumping on it. Let's hear their 
solutions. I'd love to hear some solutions from Capitol Hill. If there's going 
to be a true partnership, it's incumbent on them to bear some burden of 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the cost of the effort have ranged from $45 billion to $110 
billion. The options under consideration appear to range from a direct bailout 
by the government to additional fees or insurance premiums paid by the 
institutions and depositors. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to Congress on Feb. 9, the President plans to outline his 
proposed shifts in the 1990 federal budget submitted three weeks ago by former 
President Ronald Reagan. Fitzwater said that Bush will raise the savings and 
loan crisis in the address, "but how specific it'll be remains to be seen." A 
detailed explanation of his savings and loan proposal could risk overshadowing 
the other elements in the budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the uproar in Congress that followed the disclosure of one option -- 
imposition of an insurance fee of 25 to 30 cents for each $100 of depositors' 
accounts in banks and thrift institutions -- the President and his chief of 
staff, John H. Sununu, have made it clear that no proposals are being ruled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
But one official, seemingly ready to distance the White House from the 
controversial proposal, said: "It's not alive or dead. It's in the planning 
stage at the Treasury Department." 
</P>
<P>
Congressional criticism of the plan continued unabated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban 
Affairs Committee's subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said in a 
television interview that the idea was "born dead." 
</P>
<P>
"Read my lips: 'It's a tax,' " Dixon said, paraphrasing the no-tax pledge Bush 
made a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. "It's just that simple. It's a 
tax of 30 cents on every $100 worth of deposits." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to explain the White House reluctance to abandon the proposal in the 
wake of the congressional uproar, one senior White House official said that 
"constraining our options is the worst thing we can do. If you start ruling out 
options, you're left with a direct federal bailout, which would jack up the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
The official, meanwhile, said that while specific budget decisions are still 
several days away, it is clear that Bush would recommend no more than a slight 
boost in the $5.14 billion that Reagan proposed for the nation's anti-drug 
program. "We're going to be around where Reagan was, maybe a bit more," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing, as Bush has, the need for greater education about drug abuse as 
the focus of the nation's long-range program, he said: "Let's face it. There 
are a lot of things that can be done by the federal government well, but curing 
people of drug addiction isn't one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The President spent a full day at work despite a persistent cold that Fitzwater 
said was being treated with decongestants. 
</P>
<P>
He had a "shirt-sleeve" meeting with staff members to discuss the programs that 
he wants to see evolve from his campaign emphasis on the role of volunteer 
service in America. The meeting, said one White House assistant, was intended 
"to lay out what 1,000 points of light are." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, he visited the Labor Department to attend the swearing-in 
of Elizabeth Hanford Dole as secretary of labor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fitzwater said Bush would continue to visit the sort of all-male 
clubs with which he dined on Saturday, having lunch at the Alibi Club, a 
downtown eating club he has visited in the past, and dinner with the Alfalfa 
Club, which stages an annual get-together of senior Washington figures. 
</P>
<P>
"He's opposed to discrimination in every form, but he will go to these clubs as 
appropriate," the press secretary said.

COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
A CALL FOR RETURNING TO THE OLYMPIC IDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OLGA CONNOLLY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My commentary is not a farewell to the modern Olympic era, whose idealism seems 
to have passed into oblivion, but rather a search for a way out of the elitism 
and commercialism of international sports. 
</P>
<P>
Those two phenomena caused the demise of the ancient Olympic Games after more 
than 2,000 years. They seem to have devoured the modern Games in less than a 
century. And arbitrary, punitive measures will not remedy the ills of sports. 
Allow me to invoke the original modern Olympic message, which aspires to 
something better: 
</P>
<P>
"The main issue in life is not the victory, but the effort; the essential is 
not to have won, but to have striven well. To spread these concepts is to pave 
the way for a more valiant humanity, stronger, and consequently more scrupulous 
and generous." 
</P>
<P>
This often-quoted first paragraph of Baron Pierre de Coubertin's "Expression," 
the poetic explanation of the objectives for the modern Olympic Games, does not 
advocate that one should be a good loser, as some have interpreted it. It says 
that the process of an individual's growth through meticulous training and 
competing is more important than the fleeting glory of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Long before Coubertin, the universities in England and the physical culture 
centers in Europe maintained that physical training was indispensable in 
discovering one's potential for rich and graceful movement, promoting strength 
and stamina and molding an honest, fearless, self-disciplined and self-reliant 
character. Such ideas go back to Socrates. 
</P>
<P>
And in China, sometime between 50 and 130 A.D., a writer, Yu, described the 
impartiality and discipline of a football game: 
</P>
<P>
 A round ball and a square wall, 
</P>
<P>
 The ball flying across like the moon 
</P>
<P>
 While the teams stand opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Captains are appointed and take their places. 
</P>
<P>
 No allowances are made for relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 According to unchanging regulations, 
</P>
<P>
 There must be no partiality 
</P>
<P>
 But there must be determination and coolness 
</P>
<P>
 Without the slightest irritation at failure. 
</P>
<P>
 And if all this is necessary for football, 
</P>
<P>
 How much more for the game of life? 
</P>
<P>
In 1894, Coubertin organized a small congress. It was attended by 
representatives of 12 European nations that were tired of constant feuding on 
the Continent. They discussed the potential of the Olympic movement to produce 
something healing and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The baron convinced his peers that the essence of sports would be 
understandable everywhere, and, therefore, that sports could guide people 
toward mutual appreciation. In the second stanza of his "Expression," he said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic movement gives the world an ideal which reckons with the reality 
of life and includes the possibility to guide this reality toward the great 
Olympic Ideal: Enjoyment of muscular effort, cultivation of beauty, dedication 
to service to family and society; tying these elements into one, insoluble, 
aggregation." 
</P>
<P>
Nations' Olympic participation has grown more than a dozen times larger than 
the original gathering in Paris. As a spectacle, the Games have become a 
mega-event. But educationally, Olympic growth has been stunted by compromises 
in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most unfortunately, the ardent friendships that used to spring from mutual 
admiration and appreciation among the fiery contestants have been nearly 
suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Where tensions used to cease with the final try, the last heave or the last 
whistle, and the camaraderie began, now secretiveness and mistrust continue. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas athletes used to coach one another, the new stars and their coaches 
yield neither innovative training ideas nor time-tested knowledge to a 
potentially outstanding newcomer. The spirit of the Olympic Village, where the 
tribes of humanity are not separated by fences or mine fields, continues to 
flicker in the underdog. But the isolated, self-protective superstar lives in 
the downtown hotel. Chauvinism does not separate athletes. Money does. 
</P>
<P>
The flames of business were not lighted by the Olympic torch. They began with 
the contracts of national sports leaders who wanted to see their national 
champions excel internationally. Years ago -- and now in the greater part of 
the Third World -- the choices were obvious: Either accept the guaranteed hold 
on the Olympic medals by the better fed and rested nations, or afford one's 
home talent extra sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
But private invitational meets quickly moved in with selectively offered, 
clandestine and sizable payments. Sporting goods companies followed. The 
competitors quickly discovered that practicing their events as a vocation 
propelled them past those for whom athletics remained an avocation. 
</P>
<P>
The commercialization of athletics first was allowed to prevail in big popular 
meets in Europe, then in the United States and elsewhere, and then to roll into 
the Olympic Games. Today, for example, nearly all national teams compete in 
nationally symbolic warm-up suits and shoes given to them by sporting goods 
companies. Naturally, the athletes' clothes are paid for by the exorbitant 
markups on those companies' products sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
At the Seoul Olympics, Greg Louganis appeared to be the closest to the way the 
Olympic champion used to be, one who approached his event as an expression of 
his own artistic fire. 
</P>
<P>
In the Winter Games, an English ski jumper, Eddie Edwards, a dinosaur amateur 
nicknamed the Eagle, reflected strangely against the polish of the career 
skiers who had stopped at Calgary on their way to the next ski event. He had 
come to the Games without a hope of winning but was thrilled at the prospect of 
competing. 
</P>
<P>
The mass-appeal Summer Olympics have some people believing that it is possible 
to beat the career athletes and near-millionaires. Parents drill their tots in 
running because they think the big money lies there. 
</P>
<P>
But money and sponsorships have helped the professional athletes reach levels 
they could not possibly have reached as amateurs. Money buys time to train, 
time to rest, excellent training facilities, freedom from family economic 
pressures, diversion and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis, for instance, was not defeated by someone who was earning his 
living by working 9 to 5. Ben Johnson is a highly paid sprinter from Jamaica 
who lives comfortably in Canada. The sensational match was expected. The 
arrangements had already been made for a return race in Tokyo, for which each 
man was to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson was accused of taking steroids, which, if true, indicates that the 
record times in the sprints also have approached the upper limits of natural 
human speed. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the criticism leveled against him, however, Johnson did not violate 
anything sacred. He may have done something that others have engaged in for 
several years and for which at least a dozen others were suspended at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Too many records have been pushed to heights that lie beyond the reach of 
normally functioning men or women. The young talent who hopes to challenge such 
records is forced to fall into chemical step. 
</P>
<P>
And so, participating in sports is no longer a simple search for human physical 
development. The message to young athletes is that money confirms excellence -- 
and that excellence not confirmed by money is somehow in doubt. Moreover, 
inflated records and performances of the commercially or pharmaceutically aided 
athletes are honored as if achieved only by the old-fashioned means of 
sacrifice and grit. 
</P>
<P>
To a beginning athlete, that is discouraging. He or she may work for many 
months and show only modest progress. To get up there, the athlete surmises, 
requires either a superman or an eternity. That is a lonely thought. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial changes can be achieved only if athletics is put back in education 
as a tool for individual and national healthful development. Imperfect and 
controversial as it may be, there should be natural and open categories in 
major athletic contests, including the Olympic Games. And a new chapter in 
record books should be started. We need to relearn what are excellent 
performances by natural athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Drug testing, even the year-round, surprise testing, is only a cosmetic 
measure. It is the war cry of the adult leaders who have failed to educate, but 
would not hear about a change. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round testing really makes no sense. For it to be practical, it must be 
assumed that only a small group of high achievers will dominate and thus need 
to be tested. But to test one person and not all is discriminatory. And to test 
one early in the training season and another one later on, for example, invites 
misuse. 
</P>
<P>
To test fairly means that all the countries in the Olympic movement not only 
will choose to cooperate but will be able to afford to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
And the year-round testing idea assumes that athletes all over the world will 
gleefully cast away their rights to privacy and advise the officials of their 
whereabouts in order to be available for surprise testing. And that every time 
an athlete sees a doctor, he or she will bring along a list of banned 
substances so that one of them is not accidentally prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
Will a more valiant and stronger humanity be achieved by drug testing? What if 
someone quietly says, "I violate no rules. You are robbing me of my pride by 
your mistrust. I must be trusted if I am to learn to trust."? Will that be a 
champion speaking or one who will be kept out of the competition? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, testing deals with the symptoms rather than the problems. As long as 
the quest for victory is the primary goal, athletes will continue to augment 
natural strength, speed and endurance. 
</P>
<P>
So where do we go from here? What do we expect from athletics for our younger 
brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, cousins, friends? What 
kind of human beings do we want to represent our towns, high schools, 
universities, service clubs, ourselves? What kind of human being should 
represent humanity in the Olympic Games? 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, the basketball coach, John Wooden, composed a pyramid of success. It 
is a geometrically shaped verbal composition of physical and character 
qualities he believes have produced outstanding performers. 
</P>
<P>
One big pyramid composed of thousands of Wooden's pyramids may restore 
athletics to its proper educational role in the United States. Educators, 
parents, insurance companies must find enough love and patriotism in their 
hearts to determine what is a needed, invigorating challenge and what is a 
risky or punitive adventure. But a progressively more demanding, yet patient 
and feeling, physical education at all levels must be the pyramid's base. 
</P>
<P>
There also should be no demand on schools to provide extra training for early 
discovered talent or to push certain youngsters toward athletic scholarships or 
professional careers. A more efficient way to go would be the development of 
community clubs and a competitive club system. 
</P>
<P>
The pride of belonging to a sports club in one's town or city district -- just 
belonging -- or representing the club in a league would restore the communal 
sense in our young people. A well-run community club would help prepare the 
youth for partnership with the adult world. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the opportunity to reach the pinnacle of success is not equitable. 
And it is shrinking every day. Increasingly, the professional leagues and the 
colleges recruit talent from other corners in the world, further minimizing the 
possibility for a U.S. girl or boy to excel. Surely, many of them are invited 
to play abroad by clubs, which perpetrate similar injustice against their own 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Although a dash of such exchange would be healthy, negativism is created when 
the practice becomes a runaway situation. For our nation, which has so many 
disenchanted people, the extension of rare opportunity abroad is clearly bad. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of the U.S. teams for the Olympic Games is also a mess. 
</P>
<P>
In some events, the United States Olympic Committee maintains the traditional 
one-time grueling tryout. 
</P>
<P>
In others, the teams are held together, and paid, for years. Here the 
institutionalized coaches hold occasional tryouts whenever they please. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomer must be a super performer in the events in which the selection is 
made, based on objective measurements, and a super performer with connections 
in the events in which the outcome depends on a more subjective judgment. Even 
the National Sports Festival, which at first was hailed as the opportunity for 
juniors to demonstrate their talents, gradually reverted to publicizing the 
adult commercial athletes. 
</P>
<P>
So what chance is there for a young man or woman who graduated from high school 
and went to work? Or a college dropout? 
</P>
<P>
And how many fabulously talented athletes in the streets have killed themselves 
with narcotics? Are we caught in the paradox in which some burn their energy by 
running the streets and taking drugs, while others take drugs hoping to get in 
the running for a chance to leave the streets? 
</P>
<P>
Pierre de Coubertin's "Expression" concludes: "May joy and fellowship reign and 
in this manner, may the Olympic torch pursue its way through the ages." 
</P>
<P>
It may, if humanity's determination will carry it.

JIM MURRAY: TEAMING UP DOESN'T GET HER DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What would you think of a young lady who has won, at last count, 5 Wimbledon 
titles, 4 U.S. Opens, 7 Australian Opens, 5 French Opens -- 21 Grand Slam 
titles in all and, in fact, a Grand Slam itself 3 times? 
</P>
<P>
You would think she has had one or more ticker-tape parades, her pick of 
magazine covers and trips to the White House, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's a catch. Pam Shriver, who did all of the above, is none of the 
above. Because, she had partners. Or, more specifically, a partner -- Martina 
Navratilova -- in all but one of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
Pam's specialty is doubles. In singles, she made the finals of the U.S. Open 
once, the semifinals 3 times, and the semifinals of Wimbledon 3 times. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad career. The trouble is, the American public is not into partnerships. 
To the public, tennis is not a team game. To catch the eye of the public, you 
have to work alone. Burns and Allen, Martin and Lewis, Veloz and Yolanda might 
star in vaudeville but not at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Which is too bad, because tennis doubles is an art form all its own. Throughout 
its history, tennis has had players who have been skilled in the singles game 
but world-beaters in the ad court. 
</P>
<P>
George Lott won 5 times at Forest Hills, when the Open was played there, with 
three different partners. He won at Wimbledon with two different partners. 
Doubles specialists -- Gene Mako paired with Don Budge, Ted Schroeder paired 
with Jack Kramer, and Johnny Doeg, and John Van Ryn -- enriched and were an 
integral part of the annals of the game. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that any doubles combination, male or female, played together 
longer than Shriver and Navratilova -- 8 years. Or had the success they had. 
</P>
<P>
There is a school of thought that Shriver could be an even greater player on 
the tour, except she could never make up her mind whether she wanted to be in 
the tennis Hall of Fame or the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela is the tour's resident intellectual. When the tour hits France, the 
Louvre is safe from most serve-and-volleyers. But Pam might be there with a 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
When the tour hits Australia, others might come home with stuffed koalas. Pam 
brings back suitcases full of primitive art. 
</P>
<P>
When the then future President of the United States, George Bush, wanted to 
make up a fourth for doubles with himself, the crown prince of Japan and the 
secretary of state, he chose Pam. She may be the the only tennis professional 
in the world to have partnered with a Mikado. 
</P>
<P>
It's because Pam Shriver doesn't let tennis suffocate her life that she's not 
the one-dimensional automaton some players become. She's not living out some 
parental fantasy. Her father didn't much care whether she became a tennis 
player or not. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, as a matter of fact, did Pam. She didn't take up the game seriously -- 
if she ever did -- till she was 13. The family did not move from Baltimore to 
some sun-belt venue and enroll her in a tennis factory. In the wintertime, she 
ice skated. 
</P>
<P>
She was not using tennis to escape some repressive regime. Pam still lives in 
Baltimore. For one thing, it's close to Washington and the corridors of power 
that fascinate her more than the finals of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis is the most formful sport there is. It makes a Soviet election look like 
a tossup, by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
And women's tennis is even more formful than men's. Women's tennis is a 
monarchy, not a sport. 
</P>
<P>
The reigning monarch is Steffi Graf. She may rule longer than the Sun Kings of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Before her, there was Martina Navratilova. Before her, Chris Evert. Before her, 
Billie Jean King. And so on, clear back to Helen Wills Moody and Suzanne 
Lenglen. Molla Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
Did Steffi Graf, Navratilova, Billie Jean just want it more than Pam Shriver? 
If the crown prince of Japan were on the phone, would they decline because they 
had to work out that day? Is Shriver resigned to being a permanent member of 
the chorus, never to get the lead in this operetta? 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver was through here the other day, returning from her seventh 
Australian Open doubles win -- she rapped out in the third round in the singles 
-- on her way to Indian Wells to promote the $250,000 Virginia Slims tournament 
at the Grand Champions there March 6-12. 
</P>
<P>
"(Losing) can become a state of mind," she concedes. "You can go into a match 
just looking to win games, trying not to look foolish. But I never feel I'm 
overmatched. I feel I have the game to beat anybody when all things come 
together. I'm a very consistent player. 
</P>
<P>
"Would things be different if I had made tennis the center of my universe? I 
don't know. I have seen some people uproot families for the sake of tennis, 
make athletes think the world revolves around them, and gear their whole lives 
around a game. Not me. I'm too easily distracted." 
</P>
<P>
By things such as earthquakes in Armenia, inconsequentialities such as 
presidential elections, budget deficits, upheavals in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm addicted to current events," she admits. "And fascinated by history." 
</P>
<P>
When she goes to Athens, for instance, Pam is apt to think, "Here's where Plato 
taught," instead of, "Here's where Zina beat me in the semis, love-love." 
</P>
<P>
And when she plays with a future Mikado, she will know him as the ruler of 100 
million of the world's most industrious people and not some guy who's a sucker 
for a drop volley.

A horse trained by a former assistant of trainer Roger Stein has been detected 
running with an illegal medication in his system at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Stewards at Santa Anita, although they have not yet issued a ruling, have found 
that Notable Host, a 6-year-old gelding, tested positive for procaine after 
finishing fourth in a $15,000 race at the Arcadia track on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Notable Host is trained by Willie Washington, an assistant trainer for Stein 
until last November. When Stein was fined $2,000 and suspended for 6 months 
after one of his horses tested positive for cocaine in October, Washington took 
over training for more than 20 horses in Stein's barn. 
</P>
<P>
Stein is appealing to the California Horse Racing Board. He obtained a court 
injunction to continue training during the appeal process, but his horses 
continue to run in Washington's name. 
</P>
<P>
Notable Host was claimed by Washington for $12,500 from trainer Armando Lage, 
after the horse won at Santa Anita on Jan. 12. Washington, 46, ran Notable Host 
back 4 days later for a claiming price of $16,000, and the gelding finished 
fourth as the 3-1 second choice in the betting. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Notable Host's share of the purse -- $1,125 -- will be 
taken away when the stewards make a ruling. Washington probably will be fined 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
Procaine, listed as a local anesthetic, can resemble cocaine but is less toxic. 
Procaine is found in penicillin and may linger in a horse's bloodstream for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita steward Pete Pedersen said Notable Host was tested after the race 
in which he was claimed and there were no indications of procaine in his 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has won 5 races at the current Santa Anita meeting and is tied for 
seventh place in the trainer standings. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is scheduled to be a witness for Stein when Stein's hearing before 
an administrative law judge continues Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't figure this out," Stein said Monday. "I hear there's going to be 
another procaine positive coming out soon against another trainer, and by my 
count that will be 4 in the last 4 weeks. This after only 3 positives all last 
year."

KIMBALL SENTENCED TO 17 YEARS IN PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER OLYMPIC DIVER MUST SERVE AT LEAST A THIRD OF TERM IN FATAL DRUNK-DRIVING 
CASE 
</P>

<P>
Bruce Kimball, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist in diving, Monday was sentenced 
to 17 years in prison and 15 years' probation for a drunk-driving accident that 
killed two teen-agers and injured four last August in Brandon, Fla., a suburb 
of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, dressed in a blue jail uniform, showed no emotion during a 2 1/2-hour 
hearing in Tampa before Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe, who said he 
hopes the sentence "will scream out to the young people that you must suffer 
the consequences of drunk driving. We must stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Coe also ordered the permanent revocation of Kimball's driver's license and 
stipulated that Kimball's probation include community service. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing and a brief visit with his parents and friends, Kimball, 
25, was led from the courtroom, crying. He will remain in Hillsborough County 
Jail until he is taken to the Lake Butler reception center for the Florida 
State Prison system. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Glover of the prison system said that Kimball will be taken to one of 
the state's major facilities, but because of his lack of criminal history, he 
eventually will be put in a low-security facility. 
</P>
<P>
Under law, he must serve one-third of the sentence before becoming eligible for 
release. Thus, Kimball will not be eligible for more than 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the Florida legal system, prisoners are not eligible for parole, but they 
can receive early release at the discretion of prison officials. Coe said that 
most prisoners, except those who commit violent crimes, sex crimes or drug 
trafficking, serve 33% to 40% of their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Coe said many are released early because of a federally mandated prison cap, 
stating that when the Florida facilities reach 90% capacity, their populations 
must be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball pleaded guilty Jan. 11 to two counts of drunk driving-manslaughter and 
three counts of driving under the influence-causing serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after testimony began, he unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball was allowed to change the plea Monday to no contest, a technical move 
giving victims and their families a better chance of collecting damages from 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Fugate, one of Kimball's attorneys, said: "Bruce's only reaction was, he 
had wanted to take his punishment and wanted to do what he could to take away 
the pain and suffering from the victims and his family. He is a courageous kid, 
I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
State sentencing guidelines called for no fewer than 7 years in prison and no 
more than 22, but Coe had the discretion to go under or over those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Coe sentenced Kimball to 15 years on one count of manslaughter and 2 years on 
one count of driving under the influence-serious injury, with the sentences to 
run consecutively. Kimball drew 15 years' probation on the second manslaughter 
count and 5 years each on the two other injury counts, with the probationary 
periods to be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Coe said during sentencing that Kimball did not receive the maximum penalty 
"because the defense demonstrated no element of intent and harm in the case." 
</P>
<P>
But Coe added: "This was not only punishment, but a deterrent. He wasn't going 
to be rehabilitated. He was as rehabilitated as he would ever be." 
</P>
<P>
Several civil suits have been filed against Kimball as a result of the 
accident, and his attorneys told Coe that Kimball decided to ask that he be 
allowed to change his plea to no contest out of fear that his two insurance 
companies might evade liability if they could prove he violated conditions of 
his policy. 
</P>
<P>
"A guilty plea could possibly do that," attorney Greg Sawyer told reporters. "I 
have no indication either company would do so, but we would like to remove that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
John Skye, an assistant state attorney, said that relatives of the victims 
opposed the no-contest plea, despite the possibility that the insurance 
companies might be freed of liability by guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
"From a practical standpoint, there's going to be no problem on (proving) 
liability. This (no contest) just buffers your position," Coe said. "It doesn't 
alter in any way what is going to be proved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to allow the no-contest pleas in deference to the victims. I do not 
think it wise to run the risk on this. It is somewhat a fine point, but I don't 
see that the risk is merited." 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Bedell, father of one of the two killed, and April Bruffy, one of the 
injured, both urged Coe to impose the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kimball chose to drink and drive and then maim and kill," said Bedell, 
whose son, Robert, 19, died. Kevin Gossic, 16, was the other victim who died. 
</P>
<P>
Bedell later said he was satisfied with the sentence, but not with Kimball's 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the last minute, he didn't really consider us," Bedell said. "We were 
prepared to sit through the trial. I don't think he could face up to it 
himself. He said he was changing the plea to protect victims, but he was 
protecting himself, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see any real remorse throughout the whole thing. It has always been 
business as usual for him." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Kerker, whose son Raymond suffered a severe leg injury in the 
drunk-driving accident, said she was pleased with the sentence, although the 
ordeal -- including enormous publicity -- has left her emotionally drained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a tragedy for everyone concerned," she said from her Brandon home. 
"We're glad it is over. It's a hard thing to deal with. But drinking and 
driving has got to stop. I think this case will help stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimball, when he is out, will help people understand. Something good is going 
to come out of this, hopefully. People will kind of wake up. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce is going to have a lot to cope with. We have got to heal, but he has to 
live with what he did for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kerker, who played soccer at Brandon High School, has four pins holding 
his bones together and may receive a cast soon, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a shark took a big chunk out of his leg, but he'll be walking 
again soon," she said. "He's not the type to sit around. He's going to get back 
and do as much as he can." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Tumoszwicz, president of the Florida chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD), said in a statement: "Although nothing will undo the violent 
devastation these families must face, Bruce Kimball must answer for his 
irresponsible and criminal behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Kimball was free on bond before his Jan. 11 appearance, but since then has been 
held in a one-person cell and was checked every 15 minutes because his 
attorneys said they were concerned about his "self-destructive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Gail Kimball, told reporters the sentence was "stern, a stiff 
sentence," but said she believes her son will deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce has surmounted . . . odds before, and I believe very strongly that he 
will turn this around and that he will do his best to cope with this, and not 
only cope with it, but turn it into something where he can restructure his life 
in a manner that benefits other people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fugate, a defense attorney, said the family was upset with the length of the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"They had hoped the judge would allow a much shorter prison term, and then 
requirements that Bruce share with the public his experiences to inspire others 
not to drink and drive and have the guts to rehabilitate themselves after an 
accident. Here's someone who can tell both sides of the equation." 
</P>
<P>
Kimball survived a near-fatal crash 7 years ago near his home in Ann Arbor, 
Mich., when a woman driving a van crossed a double yellow line on a highway and 
crashed into Kimball's car. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball remained silent during the hearing, but his attorney handed Coe a 
letter that Kimball had written to the court. Coe read the letter to himself, 
but the contents were not released because he had written it as part of a 
pre-sentence investigation, the file of which still is closed. 
</P>
<P>
His parents said they had not seen the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely proud of Bruce," said his father, Dick, the University of 
Michigan diving coach. "We'll be 100% behind him." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, Kimball, who won a silver medal in platform diving at the 1984 
Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, was driving his sports car at what police 
estimated to be 75 m.p.h. when it slammed into a group of young people and cars 
at a popular gathering spot on an unlighted dead-end stretch of a road near 
Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the day, and prosecutors 
said a blood-alcohol test administered that night recorded 0.20, twice the 
legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball was in Brandon with a group of other divers training for the U.S. 
Olympic trials under the tutelage of his father, who has coached during the 
summer in Florida for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Kimball decided to continue his pursuit of another Olympic 
berth, and competed in the diving trials at Indianapolis despite opposition by 
friends of the victims and MADD. Kimball failed to qualify for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has been a media event," Fugate said. "If it had been anyone else but 
Bruce Kimball, it wouldn't have been such a harsh sentence. He got 17 years . . 
. part of the reason is because who he was and what the case had become. By 
competing in trials, it hurt him."

Mike McCormack, who has been the Seattle Seahawks' president and general 
manager for the past 6 years, has been fired, owner Ken Behring said Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Behring, who became principal owner of the team before the 1988 season, said: 
"Under new ownership, we feel it is important for us to have our own general 
manager." He cited poor communication as a major problem with McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he would interview a half-dozen candidates as possible 
replacements and that no other major changes were anticipated in the team. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone Monday night at his home, McCormack said he had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Behring confirmed that two of the people he is talking to about the job are Sam 
Jankovich, University of Miami athletic director, and Mike Blatt, a Stockton, 
Calif., businessman and former agent for several players, including the 
Seahawks' Kelly Stouffer. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack, 58, joined the Seahawks in 1982 as director of football operations 
and was made president and general manager of the team in 1983. He is a member 
of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a former NFL head coach. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack hired Coach Chuck Knox, who has 3 years left on his Seahawk contract. 
Under Knox, the Seahawks have a 57-38 record and made the playoffs four times 
in six seasons.

Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen says the outcome of the men's combined 
competition at the World Alpine Ski Championships is still open. 
</P>
<P>
But only, he might have added, if Marc Girardelli takes a wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen, enduring a sub-par year by his standards, placed 11th in the 
combined slalom Monday. Though Zurbriggen could feasibly win the gold medal, 
Girardelli is in control. 
</P>
<P>
Even the slalom winner, Norway's unheralded Ole Christian Furuseth, conceded 
the combined title to Girardelli. 
</P>
<P>
The slalom results will be paired with a downhill Friday to determine the 
combined medalists, with somewhat heavier emphasis given to the downhill in 
computing the final standings. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, an Austrian who skis for Luxembourg, positioned himself nicely in 
the slalom -- in third place. He has won three of the last four downhills on 
the World Cup circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
Two women's training runs were canceled Monday in nearby Vail after 
Switzerland's Beatrice Gafner fell coming off a jump and suffered a broken 
right leg and torn knee ligaments. Officials ordered the jump to be shaved.

CLIPPERS' GONDREZICK SAYS HE'LL ENTER SUBSTANCE ABUSE CLINIC IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a teary pregame announcement in front of only two players and Coach Don 
Casey, Clipper reserve guard Grant Gondrezick said he was voluntarily checking 
himself into the ASAP substance abuse clinic in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Gondrezick, who missed practice Sunday with what was said to be the flu, warmed 
up before Monday night's game against Atlanta at the Sports Arena but left 
after a brief discussion with Norm Nixon, Quintin Dailey and Casey. Gondrezick 
was not at his Tarzana home after the game, according to someone identifying 
himself as a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
A second-year pro from Pepperdine who played in France last season, Gondrezick 
was one of four Phoenix Suns indicted in the final week of the 1986-87 season 
on cocaine charges that were part of the biggest drug scandal in National 
Basketball Assn. history. 
</P>
<P>
He later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of witness tampering and was fined 
$100 and placed on 3 years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
All drug charges were dismissed, and they were not held against him under the 
NBA drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Clippers were told about Gondrezick's decision after the loss 
to the Hawks. Ken Norman, Gondrezick's roommate on the road, refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether Gondrezick is checking himself into the clinic because 
of drugs or alcohol. Dr. Tony Daly, the Clippers' team physician, said it was 
his understanding that Gondrezick would begin treatments today. 
</P>
<P>
"Gondo worked hard all the time," Nixon said. "He didn't miss practices, he 
didn't miss buses, he didn't miss games. Usually, you can tell the guys who 
have the problem pretty bad. But you couldn't tell with Gondo." 
</P>
<P>
Gondrezick, who was signed to a guaranteed contract before the start of the 
season that was worth $100,000 when he made the team, will go on the suspended 
list and will continue to be paid. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

FRESNO STATE 'EMBARRASSES' CS FULLERTON, 65-44

<P>
After winning only 9 games in each of his first 2 seasons, Fresno State Coach 
Ron Adams has been under scrutiny this season, his job almost certainly 
depending on whether his team can come close to .500. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night in front of 9,856 in Selland Arena, Adams reached what may 
prove a watershed, getting his 10th victory of the season as the Bulldogs 
handed Cal State Fullerton its most thorough defeat of the season, 65-44, in a 
game that Fullerton Coach John Sneed called "a total embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
With at least 10 games remaining, Adams has won more games than in either of 
his previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean? 
</P>
<P>
"This means we're getting better," Adams said. "I haven't shared my feelings 
about the first 2 years much. I have a lot to say, but I haven't said it. It 
was difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs beat Fullerton on a night when the Titans were not at their best, 
making only 18 of 58 shots (31%) and scoring fewer points than any game since a 
41-37 loss to New Mexico State last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fell behind by as many as 14 in the first half, and then saw the game 
completely unravel at the start of the second. Just 3 minutes into the final 
period, freshman guard Wilbert Hooker made a 3-pointer and Fresno State had a 
44-22 lead. The lead grew to as many as 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Jervis Cole led Fresno with 22 points, and Kevin Stevenson and 
Hooker each had 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos scored 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our poise and never recovered it," Sneed said. "I was very 
disappointed in the way we took the court. We were never ready to play. We got 
down and went in the tank. Fresno State showed more discipline and poise. We 
regressed to the way we were playing earlier in the year. That's all I have to 
say about it." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State's Adams took over in 1987, after the resignation of Boyd Grant, 
who did not have a losing season in 8 years, and who had five 20-win seasons in 
a row before his final season, when the Bulldogs went 15-15. 
</P>
<P>
The first 2 years were dismal, but with this team, Adams is becoming more 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
"On any given night, we can be a very good team," Adams said. "Certainly it 
feels better. Certainly a lot more people are pleased with what they say. . . . 
Each game is winnable, but certainly -- knock on wood -- the opposite is true." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Fresno State's success should be met with some skepticism. Among the 
10 victories are wins over Pan American, U.S. International, New Hampshire and 
Southern Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand won close games against Utah State and Cal State Long Beach. 
Among the losses 6 points to Nevada Las Vegas, 3-point losses to New Mexico 
State and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Adams, Fullerton's Sneed is in a precarious position himself, trying to 
erase the first word from his title of acting coach. A decision will not come 
until the end of the season, which in effect is one long tryout. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss, Sneed said through a team spokesman that his players would not 
be allowed to talk to reporters, but stood by while Ceballos spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't do anything," Ceballos said. "They just killed us. We couldn't run 
our offense. We weren't ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Fresno State is 10-8 overall and 5-4 in Big West Conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fell to 8-9 and 3-5.

EXPERIMENT WITH STEROIDS PROVIDED A FRIGHTENING LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 3 weeks in the winter of 1972, while training for her fifth Olympics, Olga 
Connolly turned to the world-class athlete's little helper, anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"I had four kids and a full-time job," she said. "The only time I had for 
weightlifting was at night. I was getting nowhere. I was stuck at 165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a saying in the discus, that you can throw a foot for each pound you 
can bench-press. I needed 186 to beat my personal best." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she took about one-half the men's daily dosage of Dianabol, the 
most popular steroid among athletes at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"After 3 weeks, I was bench-pressing 200 pounds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that she quit when she began to grow hair on her knees. 
</P>
<P>
"My doctor (who had not prescribed the steroids) told me that the next step 
would be to go bald," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly said that at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, she realized for 
the first time that some women were using steroids. She said that by the 1972 
Summer Olympics in Munich, steroid use was widespread. The International 
Olympic Committee did not begin testing for steroids until 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Of 12 discus throwers in the weight room, only three of us weren't on the 
drug," she said. "The other nine women were lifting well over 200 pounds, 220 
and 230 in some cases. It was really devastating to know that we were beaten 
even before we competed. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the weightlifters and tried desperately to get a steroid booster 
shot. But they explained to me that it doesn't work that way." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the gold medalist in the women's discus won with a throw of 191 feet 2 
inches, more than 27 feet shorter than gold medalist threw 4 years later. The 
eighth-place finisher in 1972 had a better throw than the 1968 champion. 
Connolly, the 1956 gold medalist with a throw of 176-1, finished sixth in 1968 
and 16th in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"I could either go on steroids or quit completely," she said. "I decided to 
quit completely. It wouldn't have been me throwing. It would have been a 
completely different organism. There would have been no personal challenge in 
it." RANDY HARVEY

SHE KNOWS HER WAY 'ON THE BOULEVARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I hope you understand French," teases Liliane Montevecchi at the top of her 
solo show, "On the Boulevard," at the Pasadena Playhouse. Actually, it's even 
more fun if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
One of Montevecchi's songs, an old one by Cole Porter, makes the distinction 
between Paris, a city in France, and "Paree," where everybody is always in 
love. It's this second, imaginary place that Montevecchi sings about. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice is not so much, a bit of a bray, and the songs aren't new ("Autumn 
Leaves," "La Vie en Rose," "If You Go Away," etc. So what's so special? 
</P>
<P>
Illusion, my friend. Based on reality, as the best illusions are. Montevecchi 
believes in "Paree," at least for the purposes of this show, and she makes us 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
She starts by disarming us. Knowing that she has starred with the Folies 
Bergere and on Broadway ("Nine"), we expect her to be a French bombshell, with 
maximum feathers and furs. 
</P>
<P>
What we get is a skinny young woman with cropped reddish hair, wearing a long 
black sweater and black stockings, the very image of the Paris shop girl who 
dresses like a million dollars on a next-to-zero budget. 
</P>
<P>
She is not what we expected, this gamin, but she is charming. And as we look 
more closely, we can see that the child is not 19 at all. She's 29. But as 
fresh, amused and hopeful as when she first came to Paris. Even more charming. 
</P>
<P>
In the second act, Montevecchi adds a cloche and puts on a few more years. Now 
she is not so hopeful as when she first came to Paris. But she is still 
interested in how it is all going to come out. And she is much more experienced 
than the shop girl. Oh, much more. 
</P>
<P>
All this is the show's visual subtext, not necessarily tied to what Montevecchi 
is saying or singing at any given moment. (There are songs of experience in the 
first act and comic songs in the second.) But the subtext gives us a ground of 
physical belief that is missed when Americans do this material, even when they 
do it well, as in the Playhouse's production of "Jacques Brel Is..." last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to have the language to perform these songs, but you do have to 
have the body language. Montevecchi was born to it, and strengthens it with a 
dancer's line. You also have to have the proper attitude to do these songs. You 
have to convey the realistic shrug to be found at the bottom of all French 
ballads. Love is hell, but life goes on. Montevecchi's philosophy in a 
nutshell. 
</P>
<P>
She has another quality that one associates with the French. She knows how to 
make her guests at the Playhouse's little Balcony Theatre feel welcome. It's 
not simply a matter of vamping the gentlemen, which she does in the second act. 
It's the ability to be happy at one's own party -- to be convinced that it is 
indeed the best one in town. 
</P>
<P>
Montevecchi did a show in New York Saturday night, did another one in San 
Francisco Sunday afternoon and made us feel that these were just warm-ups for 
the weekend's real business -- to entertain her wonderful friends in Pasadena. 
The great hostess knows how to lie. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the illusion, how much performing talent is involved in all this? Well, 
as in her costumes, Montevecchi makes a little go a long way. She doesn't take 
you very deeply into her material, but French cafe songs aren't deep: They 
reflect a mood that will pass with the next round. She knows this, and knows 
that 90 minutes (with intermission) is long enough for a party of this sort to 
run. Thrift -- another French virtue. "On the Boulevard" is just what it ought 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
Plays Tuesdays-Fridays at 8:30 p.m., Saturdays at 5:50 and 8:30 p.m., Sundays 
at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Closes Feb. 25. Tickets $17- $25. 39 S. El Molino Ave., 
Pasadena. (818) 356-PLAY.

VIOLA RECITAL IN PACIFIC PALISADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Hatch has been championing the distinctly undersung viola repertory 
locally for many years. Since 1983 his principal forum has been an annual 
concert series entitled "The Magic of the Viola." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 installment of the series began Sunday evening, with a program that 
focused on showmen's tricks rather than any real magic. Capably played by 
Hatch, the recital also inaugurated the new, 125-seat Pierson Playhouse in 
Pacific Palisades as a public chamber music venue. With clear acoustics and 
sight-lines, and a fine, resident Kawai grand, the hall could make a 
significant addition to Westside musical life. 
</P>
<P>
The violin music of 19th-Century virtuosos Henry Vieuxtemps and Joseph Joachim 
is hardly heard today, let alone their viola music. Vieuxtemps' Sonata is a 
quirky work of both gold and brass, while his needlessly revived Elegy proved 
pure dross. Joachim's three "Hebraische Melodien" mines a characteristic vein 
of earnest, long-lined brooding. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch provided a wealth of firmly focused, clearly directed sound. His is a 
rather reticent stage personality, and he came to grief tempermentally and 
technically in Vieuxtemps' most eccentric, flamboyant passages. 
</P>
<P>
The equally daunting challenges of Enesco's Concert Piece, however, were 
cleanly nailed with conviction and elan. He made a cogent case for Hindemith's 
Sonata, Opus 11, No. 4, and supplied three sweetly sung encores, one of his own 
arranging. 
</P>
<P>
Italian pianist Francesco Bencivenga had no easy task with most of these 
accompaniments, and played them with imposing technical clarity and musical 
sympathy. JOHN HENKEN

DEUKMEJIAN'S HOUSING CUTBACKS ASSAILED; 
</P>
<P>
ADVOCATES SAY BUDGET PLAN WOULD CRIPPLE RUNNING OF SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials and homeless advocates are mounting an intense lobbying 
effort to head off Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal to eliminate funding for 
the California Housing Trust Fund, which they say would cripple the day-to-day 
running of shelters for the homeless and "shared housing" programs for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund has provided $2 million to $10 million statewide annually to pay 
counselors' salaries, utility bills and other daily costs at facilities ranging 
from the huge Weingart Center on Skid Row to tiny neighborhood programs. Under 
Deukmejian's budget, proposed earlier this month, the fund would get no money. 
</P>
<P>
"Where and how does the governor think we'll be taking care of these people -- 
in prisons?" asked Maxene Johnston, executive director of the Weingart Center. 
"This (homeless) problem -- I don't think he gets it, and I don't think his 
advisers get it. We're looking around for other sources of money and we are 
anticipating a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is he doing this?" asked Janet Witkin, director of Alternative Living for 
the Aging, which matches low-income elderly people with roommates to split the 
cost of skyrocketing local rents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have visitors from Europe coming here all the time to check out this great 
program, to copy it, and now the governor's going to cut our key funding," 
Witkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Stewart, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Housing and Community 
Development, said the money has been cut from the budget because California's 
revenues from tideland oil extraction have dwindled. The revenues, used to 
finance everything from education programs to the trust fund, "went into 
education and other programs when the priorities were decided this time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said her department is not trying to find another source of money to 
keep the programs afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Brown, of the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, said his group 
is "pushing hard" to have the cuts restored when legislative committees review 
the budget this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Deukmejian's cuts "would be a real tragedy for California." They 
include the Farmworker Housing Grant Fund -- money earmarked for improving 
slumlike farm worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Squier, Mayor Tom Bradley's housing coordinator, said scores of 
grass-roots programs and shelters are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I'll tell you, these small shelter operations are all over the place -- 
just chewing-gum operations -- and if Deukmejian could only see how great the 
problem is and how we are trying to deal with it, he would be a lot more 
understanding," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have argued that the cuts will be offset by 
Propositions 77 and 84, approved by voters last November, which provide $425 
million for shelters and low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
However, bond money cannot be used for daily costs, only for construction and 
rehabilitation of buildings. "They give us the bricks and mortar, but there's a 
desperate need for human services," said Ruth Schwartz, director of the Shelter 
Partnership in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, of the Weingart Center, said that of the 6,000 people who have sought 
help there, "62% did not return to the street because of the extra care and 
attention we gave them. Without the programs, they will go back on the 
streets." The center's counseling and job referral programs receive 
three-quarters of their money from the trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and advocates for the homeless have increasingly criticized 
Deukmejian's resistance to housing programs -- especially his dozens of vetoes 
of major housing bills over the years. 
</P>
<P>
California has the largest homeless population in the nation and the worst 
rental housing affordability problem, with 790,000 families living in housing 
beyond their means, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in 
Washington. But it ranks near the bottom of the industrial states in funding 
housing programs.

SENSE OF HISTORY, FEAR DRAW TRIAL SPECTATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
College professor Ray Ceniceroz said he was there to witness a slice of Los 
Angeles history. "It's like coming to see Queen Elizabeth," said the 
54-year-old Arcadia resident. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Barnard skipped class at USC to attend, recalling still the fear that 
swept Southern California three years ago. "It influenced my life a great 
deal," she said. "I was so careful." 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Persky, 66, a men's clothing salesman from Northridge, admitted he was 
drawn to the courtroom by his fascination with the vagaries of justice. His 
first impression was that the defendant's decision to wear sunglasses was 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
They had come, along with scores of others, to witness the opening Monday of 
the Night Stalker trial. A capacity crowd in the courtroom of Superior Court 
Judge Michael A. Tynan heard an opening statement and initial testimony against 
Richard Ramirez, a 28-year-old drifter from El Paso accused of 13 murders and 
30 other felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom, with room for about 75 spectators, was packed mainly with news 
reporters and lawyers. About 20 members of the general public also were allowed 
to file through a metal detector and take seats inside. Dozens more waited 
outside, eager to get in. Some stood in line for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Just before 11 a.m., bailiffs declared the courtroom filled, and Ramirez was 
escorted to his seat at the defense table. The crowd watched silently, and the 
only thing that could be heard was the jangling of the defendant's shackles. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan called the trial -- which is expected to take more than a year -- to 
order. The judge began by delivering a piece of distinctly Southern California 
advice to the jurors: "I would think about jogging, lifting weights. You're 
going to have to do something physical." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Part to Play 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who came to the proceeding was drawn by spectacle. Jack Vincow 
came because of his mother. He would be the first witness. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1984, Vincow found his mother, Jennie, 79, slashed to death in the bed 
of her Glassell Park apartment. After the opening statement, the 50-year-old 
pharmacist shuffled to the stand and began to describe the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a neck gash that looked like someone attempted to remove her head 
and nearly succeeded," Vincow testified in his pronounced Brooklyn accent. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, over a cafeteria lunch, he had discussed his unceasing trauma. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss of someone close to you is painful to anyone," he said, "but the 
difference with a loss due to natural causes and a loss due to vicious, 
senseless, irrational violence is . . . beyond imagination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Need to Relax 
</P>
<P>
Vincow said he was very close to his mother, and after her death had considered 
taking tranquilizers. Instead, he turned to meditation. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose for myself two simple words: calm and relaxed. Just think about them 
and repeat them, two simple words to meditate on: calm and relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Vincow, who is currently writing a book about meditation, said he was not 
nervous about testifying against Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to, number one, see that justice is done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hallway outside the courtroom, another man with a personal interest in 
the case lingered. It was Ramirez's older brother, Julian. His gray sweat shirt 
stood in sharp contrast to his brother's gray pinstriped suit and black 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibly, Hope for Some 
</P>
<P>
Julian Ramirez would not comment on whether his brother is guilty, but 
expressed hope that the case might make people aware about the dangers of 
certain heavy metal lyrics said to fascinate his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Julian Ramirez said, "he'll save some souls if people learn about that 
kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, more than 50 would-be spectators were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair," said Gee Goodwin, 31, a Jamaican native studying law in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin said that hypothetical murder cases regularly are reviewed in the 
criminal law class he had skipped Monday to attend the opening. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "the cases are not this ugly."

This time it was for real, when Johnson went back to his suite at the Hotel 
Bel-Air shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday and found a man allegedly pawing through 
the purse belonging to Johnson's once and future wife, actress Melanie 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
The couple surprised the man in mid-rifling before he could lift the costly 
jewelry in the handbag, police say. Johnson -- obviously a method actor -- 
dropped into character, blocked the man's exit, told him to stop what he was 
doing, patted him down to make sure he was unarmed and held him until a 
policeman working as a hotel security guard arrived. Booked for investigation 
of attempted burglary was David Johnson, 34, no relation to Don.

Guy probably didn't recognize Johnson if he wasn't wearing aqua.

It's lonely at the top -- or wherever.

In 1985, newspeople cast about for a convenient name for the perpetrator of a 
series of grisly murders, for which suspect Richard Ramirez went on trial 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
For a time it was the "Valley Intruder," or "Valley Invader." When the killings 
went statewide, the monikers came down to two: "the Night Stalker," ultimately 
used by most news agencies, and "the Walk-In Killer," employed by KNBC News, 
period. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, even the mother ship, NBC, reported on the "Today" show on the 
opening day of trial for the suspected "Night Stalker" -- moments after KNBC 
noted the opening day of trial for the suspected "Walk-In Killer." 
</P>
<P>
You might think two different guys are on trial for the same crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Unbowed, KNBC is pledging to keep its lonely vigil. Says news director Tom 
Capra, mindful that it was a KNBC camera that recorded Ramirez's arrest, "We 
always kind of considered him to be our story." 
</P>
<P>
And you thought the presidential campaigns went on forever. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13 years after a Torrance City Council candidate was elected, a huge 
billboard exhorting voters to cast their ballots for him somehow turned up in a 
vacant lot in Lincoln Heights, more than a dozen miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Constituents complained to Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria Molina about the 
"incredible eyesore," said spokeswoman Alma Martinez. Dan Walker -- still in 
office -- declared he had rented the sign briefly, just before the 1976 
election, and not seen it since. Still, Walker was "the most visible owner" -- 
in letters several feet high, Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
Plan One -- hauling the 15-by-25-foot billboard to the steps of Torrance City 
Hall -- was abandoned. "We were concerned of being accused of the same thing 
we're accusing Mr. Walker of," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Plan Two -- bureaucracy -- prevailed. The sign, its ELECT DAN WALKER TORRANCE 
CITY COUNCIL still legible and apparently owned by a billboard advertising 
firm, was ticketed and given 10 days to get out of town.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheldon S. King, president and chief executive officer of Stanford University 
Hospital, will resign effective May 1 to become president of Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles, a spokesman said. King, 57, has been at Stanford 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going to a major metropolitan center," hospital spokesman Spyros 
Andreopoulos said. "He has been here long enough to do what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Among King's objectives was to open a modernized wing of the Stanford Hospital. 
After a decade of planning, the $153-million wing opened to patients two weeks

WOMAN SENTENCED FOR HARASSING SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Municipal Court judge quoted lyrics from a Michael Jackson song as 
he sentenced a woman Monday to 2 1/2 years in jail for repeatedly harassing the 
singer and claiming to be his wife "Billie Jean." 
</P>
<P>
Lavon A. Muhammad, 41, was found guilty last week of eight misdemeanor charges 
stemming from her violation of a 1986 court order that she not pose as the 
singer's wife or visit his Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
As he imposed the maximum allowable sentence, Judge Stephen E. O'Neil urged 
that Muhammad -- who insisted that court officials call her Billie Jean Jackson 
-- listen to a song on Michael Jackson's latest album, "Bad." The song is 
entitled "Leave Me Alone." 
</P>
<P>
Muhammad has never met Jackson but claims that the singer fathered her three 
children, Deputy City Atty. David S. Kestenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said she tried to buy a wedding gown and bill it to Jackson and 
had a bill for $145 in medical treatment sent to Jackson's house. She walked up 
Jackson's driveway and was arrested by Los Angeles police early this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two con artists who posed as a young married couple down on their luck to 
swindle people around Los Angeles out of money were sentenced Monday to County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn sentenced Jeffrey Dwayne Allman, 31, to 
15 months in jail and sentenced Tracy Chris Hartland, 24, to nine months behind

YOUTH IN VEHICLE FLEEING FROM OFFICER SHOT IN HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and JACK JONES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy was critically wounded in the back of the head early Monday 
when an off-duty police officer fired at the car in which he and a companion 
allegedly were fleeing from an Eagle Rock convenience store with two stolen 
cases of beer, detectives reported. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the unidentified youth and Eddie Arzate, 20, both of 
Highland Park, ran out of a 7-Eleven store at 1910 W. Colorado Blvd. with the 
beer shortly after midnight as the clerk, Kurian Tharaikat, chased them. 
</P>
<P>
A store employee who asked not to be identified said Monday evening, "Those 
kids were making what they call a beer run. We have a strict company policy not 
to chase them. That just makes me sick . . . getting kids shot over beer." 
</P>
<P>
Tharaikat could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Robert Bain, 45, was driving into the parking lot with his 24-year-old 
son, Brian, as Tharaikat shouted what the officer believed to be "I've been 
robbed," authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
While his son followed the suspects on foot, Officer Bain drove after the 
suspects and attempted to cut them off with his vehicle just as they got into a 
car on Highland View Avenue, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Bain, who believed "he was confronting armed robbery suspects," drew 
his personal 9-millimeter pistol, got out of his car, identified himself as a 
police officer and ordered the two to remain in their own vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
But the suspects' car allegedly accelerated, crashed into a parked vehicle and 
then sped away. Bain fired once, police said, striking the driver's side 
window. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents of the block, however, said they distinctly heard two shots, 
and one witness said he saw a flash from the officer's weapon on the second 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 a.m., Arzate drove to County-USC Medical Center with the wounded 
teen-ager and two women, Rhonda Hicks, 23, and Angie Tovar, 22, police said. 
The wounded youth was placed on a life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
Arzate was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, a vehicle.

POLAROID ANNOUNCES $1.1-BILLION BUYBACK TO REPEL SHAMROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polaroid Corp., fighting off a hostile takeover bid by Shamrock Holdings, said 
Monday that it will spend $1.1 billion to buy back its own shares and will sell 
a minority stake for $300 million to a friendly investment fund. The moves may 
signal an end to Shamrock's six-month quest for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge, Mass., instant photography giant also hinted that it may give 
shareholders some of the damages it recovers from Eastman Kodak in a major 
patent infringement case. Analysts have said Polaroid could recover as much as 
$2 billion in damages from Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's president and chief executive, defended 
Polaroid's plan in an interview. "We think we have done the right thing and the 
fair thing. There's nothing to be embarrassed or worried about," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement is the latest setback for Shamrock, a Burbank investment 
firm, owned by the Roy E. Disney family, that has been seeking Polaroid since 
July and raised its offer for the company nearly two weeks ago to about $3 
billion from $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Shamrock can successfully sue to overturn Polaroid's plan, the battle to 
acquire Polaroid, the pioneer in instant photography and one of the nation's 
best-known brand names, may soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Shamrock said the company sued in Delaware late Monday and 
would disclose the details of the lawsuit today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Success Doubted 
</P>
<P>
Traders and analysts said, however, that they doubt that a Shamrock court 
challenge would be successful, noting that placing shares in the hands of 
friendly investors is relatively common. In 1987, for example, Solomon Inc. 
sold preferred stock representing 12% of the securities firm's voting power to 
investor Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. when it appeared that 
investor Ronald O. Perelman might launch a bid for Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid sold the minority stake to Corporate Partners, a fund organized by the 
Wall Street firm Lazard Freres, which raised $1.55 billion last year from 
institutional investors. The fund is believed to be the first on Wall Street 
whose mission is to act as a "white squire," Wall Street jargon for someone who 
buys a minority stake in a company to help it fend off a hostile suitor. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate Partners is buying $300 million in preferred stock from Polaroid that 
can be converted into about 6 million shares at $50 each. In addition, 
Corporate Partners received warrants -- securities that allow investors to buy 
a specific number of shares within a given period at a certain price -- for 
635,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% to 15% Stake Likely 
</P>
<P>
Those shares Corporate Partners controls are likely to eventually represent a 
stake in Polaroid of 10% to 15%, depending on how much of its common stock 
Polaroid can buy for the $1.1 billion it plans to spend. Based on Monday's 
closing price of $40.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 
the money would buy about 27 million shares, or nearly 38% of Polaroid's 71.6 
million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The selling of the stake to Corporate Partners makes a takeover more difficult 
because Polaroid has already sold a nearly 13% stake in the company to an 
employee stock fund. Shamrock in December lost a bid to challenge that plan in 
Delaware Chancery Court and is appealing now to the Delaware Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid's financial restructuring comes less than two weeks after Shamrock 
raised its offer and threatened to launch a proxy fight to unseat Polaroid's 
directors at the company's annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold called Polaroid's plan a "thinly veiled 
effort to stuff the ballot box in anticipation of its annual meeting." He said 
that "there appears to be no discernible business purpose" for Polaroid to 
issue the preferred stock to Corporate Partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Than a Hint' 
</P>
<P>
Booth said in the interview that Polaroid's reference to the Kodak damages in 
its announcement, which the company said would be used "to enhance short-term 
value to shareholders," is "more than a hint" that money would be distributed 
to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention here is to give them their share of the recovery quickly," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Boston found in 1985 that Kodak violated Polaroid patents 
during a brief venture into the instant photography business in the 1970s. The 
damages phase of the trial is scheduled to start April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the announcement was not prompted by the increase in Shamrock's bid 
or by the threat of a proxy fight. Rather, he said, it was because Polaroid 
reached an agreement Sunday with Corporate Partners after negotiating with the 
fund since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The fund's managing partner is Lester Pollack, a lawyer and Wall Street veteran 
once nicknamed "the third Tisch brother" when he worked in the 1970s alongside 
investors Laurence A. Tisch, chief executive of CBS, and his brother, Preston 
Robert Tisch, president of Loews Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack, who was elected as a Polaroid director on Sunday, said in an interview 
that Corporate Partners believes that cost cutting by Polaroid -- estimated to 
save about $100 million annually -- has been effective and that the company has 
a number of strengths. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a unique franchise, recognized name and strong research and development. 
It is not without risk, but it has sound prospects," Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POLAROID'S GAMBIT 
</P>
<P>
The instant photography giant's financial restructuring calls for . . . 
</P>
<P>
Spending about $1.1 billion to repurchase common stock. Based on Monday's 
closing price of $40.625, that would buy more than a third of its 71.6 million 
shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Selling $300 million in preferred stock -- convertible into 6 million shares of 
common stock at $50 each -- and warrants for 635,000 shares to Corporate 
Partners L.P., an investment fund organized by the Wall Street firm Lazard 
Freres &amp; Co. to invest in firms fighting hostile bids. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly distributing to shareholders some damages recovered in a patent 
infringement case it has won against Eastman Kodak. Analysts estimate that 
Polaroid may recover $1 billion to $2 billion in the damages phase of the 
trial, scheduled to start April 17. Los Angeles Times

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: IMMIGRATION REFORM A SUCCESS -- FOR SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic law passed by Congress in 1986 to stem the flood of illegal aliens 
who poured into this country for many decades seems to be doing remarkably well 
after a fitful start. 
</P>
<P>
Its success has been largely unnoticed amid the welter of complaints about it, 
complaints largely arising because the law is doing what it was supposed to do: 
curb the flow of illegals by reducing their chances for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the law shows its value, at least two fundamental problems that it 
created are becoming painfully visible and urgently need congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
One is the issue of dealing with the millions of illegal aliens -- no one knows 
exactly how many -- who came here before the law was passed but who were 
excluded from its protection because Congress arbitrarily picked Jan. 1, 1982, 
as a cutoff date. 
</P>
<P>
The huge influx of ineligible aliens who came after 1982 cannot and should not 
be rounded up like criminals and thrown out just because Congress guessed that 
date would be as good a cutoff point as any other. And yet the people trapped 
in that congressionally created time box are more open than ever to vicious 
exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of the fact that the 
workers have few job options anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), a key architect of immigration reform, 
says he and others in Congress are studying legislative approaches to help 
those trapped workers. 
</P>
<P>
Another increasingly serious problem is the massive sales of forged documents 
to newly arriving illegals who use them to try to claim, fraudulently, that 
they were here before the 1982 cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious solution is a tamper-resistant Social Security card that would be 
used by all workers applying for jobs. Forgeries would be far more difficult 
(the system works well for credit cards); workers could be protected against 
discrimination, and honest employers could quickly determine if a job applicant 
is here legally. All workers are already required to have Social Security 
cards, so a new card would be no more intrusive on one's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The serious problems do not diminish the remarkable success of the Immigration 
Reform Act. Its achievement can best be estimated by the precipitous drop in 
the number of people picked up by the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
since the law was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1986, before the law took effect, the INS apprehended 1,767,400 
people who were trying to slip into the United States illegally. In fiscal 
1988, which ended last September, the number plunged to 1,008,143 -- a drop of 
more than 40%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of this fiscal year, the total is down an additional 
15%. Huge numbers of illegals are still getting here, but at last this country 
is gaining control of its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for the diminished influx goes to a provision in the law that for the 
first time requires fines and even prison sentences for employers convicted of 
knowingly hiring illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
That provision means that the exploiters of illegals can at last be punished. 
In the past, only the worker was punished, by being deported, and the exploiter 
was free to hire other illegals. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties against the exploiters are just starting to bite. So far, about 1,200 
employers have been fined more than $4 million for knowingly hiring illegals. 
</P>
<P>
But even that token amount seems to be having the desired effect of reducing 
the number of employers who hire illegals. This creates openings for workers 
who are in this country legally but who cannot compete for jobs with the often 
desperate illegals, who are usually willing to work for wages far below the 
legal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The newly legalized workers, along with millions of other domestic workers, 
need to be helped by rigorous enforcement of worker protection measures such as 
minimum wage laws. 
</P>
<P>
But worker protection laws have not been seriously enforced during the past 
eight years despite the calls for more "law and order" from former President 
Ronald Reagan and President Bush at the national level and from governors such 
as California's George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of pro-worker laws is especially difficult when illegals are 
involved, because they fear deportation and are afraid to file complaints 
against their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
INS and local authorities report a substantial increase in street-corner pickup 
spots where employers prowl daily for the cheap labor of illegals. 
</P>
<P>
As troublesome as that increase is, it is another indication that employers in 
established businesses are no longer as willing as they had been to hire the 
illegals, and many of those already here or still coming in are being forced to 
hustle jobs on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
Also, wages in many of the lowest-paying menial jobs are increasing slightly as 
employers try to find domestic workers to replace illegals. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million former illegal aliens have filed applications for amnesty 
and, therefore, are eligible to legally get jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
These workers are no longer so easily exploited because they do not face the 
threat of deportation if they complain. Also, their availability has reduced 
fears of massive labor shortages caused by the immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
Although it needs improvement, the immigration reform measure that was passed 
after decades of debate appears to be improving what was an unacceptable way of 
helping jobless foreign workers and providing cheap labor for devious 
employers.

"It appears they have moved off the user fee on deposits toward increasing the 
assessment on depository institutions," said Kenneth Guenther of the 
Independent Bankers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
"What started out as a user fee on depositors now looks like a hike in deposit 
insurance premiums," added Fritz Elmendorf of the Consumer Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration invited controversy its first week in office with its 
idea to charge bank and thrift customers a fee of 25 to 30 cents for every $100 
of deposits. The funds would go to rescue the nation's ailing thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at member 
thrifts for up to $100,000, faces billions of dollars in liabilities because of 
losses at federally insured thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department has been considering higher premiums for deposit 
insurance and is undecided whether banks or customers should pay, a department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But after severe criticism from members of Congress, President Bush now wants 
to narrow the size of the group that will pay to clean up the nation's thrift 
crisis, said the IBAA's Guenther. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still rejecting the broadest group of all by saying they will not 
take the money out of general revenues," Guenther said. 
</P>
<P>
Raising insurance premium fees on banks to pay for troubled thrifts will also 
cause hundreds of profitable banks to go into the red, Guenther added. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Breeden, a special assistant to Bush, told the American Banker trade 
publication that the Administration wants to avoid having taxpayers cover the 
cost of the savings and loan crisis. It would be easier to raise the premiums 
on banks than to charge depositors a user fee, Breeden told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"If you raise premiums, you don't have to ask taxpayers to pay a nickel," 
Breeden said, adding that he thought federal deposit insurance was underpriced. 
</P>
<P>
One plan being considered would have financial institutions pay the higher fee, 
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said in a television interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that the 
25-cent user fee was one option Treasury was considering to restore FSLIC to 
financial health. 
</P>
<P>
But members of Congress criticized the idea, saying it violated Bush's pledge 
of no new taxes and would also discourage savings. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to higher premiums, the Treasury spokesman said: "An option within 
the option is who would pay the fee, the banks or the depositors." No decisions 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and thrifts now pay 0.083% of their deposits for federal deposit 
insurance, while thrifts also pay a special assessment of 0.125%. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it will require savings and 
loans to spell out how they are managing exposure to interest rate risks. The 
board, parent of FSLIC, said the new rules are contained in a bulletin from the 
Office of Regulatory Activities.

WHITTAKER CORP. SAYS IT EXPECTS CHARGES IN PROBE OF PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Whittaker Corp., a Los Angeles defense contractor, said Monday that it expects 
to be criminally charged by the federal government in connection with payments 
made by employees to a government official. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse announcement, the company said that last Friday Justice Department 
attorneys presented evidence to Whittaker indicating that certain employees and 
consultants "caused money to be paid to a government employee in connection 
with certain government contracts in violation of law." 
</P>
<P>
All of the individuals involved no longer are with Whittaker or have been 
suspended without pay, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company repeatedly declined to identify the employees and consultants or to 
disclose which of its contracts and subsidiaries may be involved. But the 
matter is believed to be part of "Operation Ill Wind," the ongoing Pentagon 
procurement investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker's now-closed Communications &amp; Control Systems unit in 
Fayetteville, Ark., was among the more than one dozen defense contractors whose 
premises were searched last June when the Pentagon procurement scandal first 
became public. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the probe said investigators have checked to see whether 
payments made on behalf of that subsidiary were made to Jack A. Sherman, a 
former Pentagon procurement officer who pleaded guilty last Friday to accepting 
bribes from consultants. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the guilty plea, the Marine Corps moved Monday to remove Sherman 
from his job. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigative sources, FBI agents in Fayetteville found memos, 
government contracts and other documents showing recent contacts between 
Sherman, a veteran Marine Corps contracting official, and Scott M. Lamberth, 
one of the three co-founders of Lee Telecommunications Corp., a company that 
Whittaker purchased in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman and Lamberth had served together at Marine headquarters in Washington 
in the early 1970s, military records show. 
</P>
<P>
Records available to The Times showed that the small Arkansas firm received 
$1.9 million in defense contracts in 1986 and about $1 million in 1985. In 
1984, the firm received about $4 million, much of it for technical and 
engineering services in the development and modification of the Marine Corps 
command, control and communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday, defense contractor Unisys said it expects to soon enter 
into substantive discussions with prosecutors in the government's investigation 
into defense contracting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, one of the nation's largest computer makers, said 
it is cooperating fully with the federal government and will continue to 
cooperate. The company has not yet begun settlement discussions, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that settlement discussions had begun 
and that they could involve a payment of at least $30 million to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
A former Unisys official and a former consultant to the company pleaded guilty 
Friday to bribery and conspiracy in connection with the Pentagon's probe into 
possible fraud in defense procurement.

Because of a slight dip in the median price of housing in December, more 
Californians were able to afford a home, the California Assn. of Realtors said. 
The $5,000 drop to $172,405 in the median price of a California home marked the 
first time in two years that housing costs actually declined, narrowing -- at 
least temporarily -- an affordability gap that had been widening by the month. 
The group said 23% of the state's households earned enough income -- $54,764 a 
year -- to purchase a median-priced, single-family, detached home in December.

TEXACO STOCK OFF 8% IN WAKE OF ICAHN DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
SPECULATORS PULL OUT AS TAKEOVER SPECTER FADES; ANALYSTS SEE ONLY PLUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of Texaco shares tumbled almost 8% Monday, apparently because the 
speculators who had banked for months on a takeover attempt were suddenly 
abandoning the shrunken oil giant. 
</P>
<P>
There was general agreement among investment analysts that the hit suffered by 
Texaco stock, which fell $4.25 a share in heavy trading, was a short-lived 
reaction to weekend developments which should bode well for the company over 
the longer term. 
</P>
<P>
The company on Sunday announced a pact with its largest shareholder, Carl C. 
Icahn, that appears to end his feud with Texaco management and to eliminate him 
as a prospective suitor for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn has been the final vestige of the turmoil that began in November, 1985, 
when a Texas jury slapped Texaco with an $11-billion penalty for its tactics in 
wresting Getty Oil Co. away from the clutches of Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trading Heavy 
</P>
<P>
By agreeing not to buy any more shares and to vote his stock in line with other 
shareholders, Icahn deflated the fond hopes of speculators and led to Monday's 
steep falloff, analysts said. Texaco shares closed at $50.25 a share on trading 
of more than 5 million shares, second-largest volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"With Icahn effectively stepping aside, it obviously reduces the (speculator) 
potential," said analyst George Gaspar of Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in 
Milwaukee. Gaspar said, "It could take a few days to shake down" the stock 
speculators. 
</P>
<P>
Calculating the fair value of Texaco's shares has been a tricky affair for 
several years as the company operated under the cloud of the $11-billion court 
judgment, filed for bankruptcy protection, fought a proxy battle with Icahn and 
finally began selling off billions of dollars in assets. 
</P>
<P>
A pending $8-per-share special dividend to shareholders, which was part of the 
agreement announced Sunday, and Texaco's string of asset sales prolong still 
further a judgment on what Texaco shares are worth, said analyst Rosario 
Ilacqua of Nikko Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to have a clear reading until they report earnings under this 
new (corporate) configuration," said Ilacqua. "The whole question here is what 
Texaco shares are worth after the special distribution to shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
The special dividend distribution and a $500-million stock repurchase plan 
would total $2.4 billion, including some $336 million to Icahn as owner of 
16.6% of Texaco's shares. It is subject to shareholder approval at the 
company's annual meeting in May. The two-stage, $8-per-share special dividend 
would probably be distributed in June and September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold $7 Billion in Assets 
</P>
<P>
Texaco recently agreed to sell its Canadian subsidiary to Exxon Corp. for about 
$4 billion, bringing to nearly $7 billion the value of holdings it has sold 
over the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
Disregarding the special dividend, some analysts view Texaco stock to be worth 
about $45 a share. With the prospect of a takeover battle, the stock had been 
trading in the $55 range until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"At $50, Texaco is in a no-man's land," said analyst Gaspar. "When it gets to 
$45 it's a good buy. In the mid-50s it's a sell." 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Joel Fischer, who follows Texaco for Drexel Burnham Lambert, sees it 
rebounding to $52 or $53 a share, reflecting a basic worth of $42 to $45 plus 
the special $8 payout. Fischer has been recommending a long-term investment in 
Texaco "as a going concern." 
</P>
<P>
"Management is strong, they're getting rid of dead assets, they have 
high-quality earnings," said Fischer. Concurred Ilacqua: "This is going to be a 
better-run company than it was before."

TURNING AWAY FROM TEXACO, ICAHN SAYS HE'LL FOCUS ON BUILDING TWA 
</P>

<P>
Investor Carl C. Icahn, after agreeing to end his pursuit of Texaco Inc., says 
he will focus on Trans World Airlines, possibly building up his airline through 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got an airline to run," Icahn said in a telephone interview from his 
suburban New York home. "We may enlarge it." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn took over TWA in early 1986, winning concessions from the airlines' 
unions when TWA brought in Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo to make a 
competing bid. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend Texaco announced a $1.9-billion special dividend and 
$500-million stock buyback plan. In return, Icahn agreed to stop buying up 
Texaco shares. He owns 16.6% of Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
"We made peace," Icahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn stands to reap more than $336 million from the dividend alone on his 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would add to the airline by acquisitions, Icahn said, "That's the 
best way to enlarge it." He declined to elaborate. Icahn last fall held 
unsuccessful discussions about buying Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The truce with Texaco is the second Icahn has reached in little over two years 
with a major American industrial concern. Icahn called off his attack on USX 
Corp. after it restructured to escape his takeover threat. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's battle with Texaco has been long and antagonistic. Last year, he 
proposed a more than $11-billion takeover of the company and waged a failed 
battle to seize control of its board. 
</P>
<P>
Embattled Texaco since then has reached agreements to sell $7 billion in 
assets, including the stake it holds in Texaco Canada for $3.24 billion.

EX-MGM CHIEF LADD HEADING NEW COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian financiers Giancarlo Parretti and Florio Fiorini, who took control of 
the troubled Cannon Group last year, have formed a new movie production company 
headed by former MGM Chairman Alan Ladd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the new company, called Pathe Entertainment Co., declined to 
disclose the terms of the deal. But industry sources said Pathe would have more 
than $400 million at its disposal over four years for film making and 
acquisitions of studio facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest in UA Division 
</P>
<P>
One of those acquisitions could involve MGM/UA Communications, industry sources 
said. In recent months, Parretti and Ladd separately have expressed interest in 
buying all or part of that company. MGM/UA's majority owner, Kirk Kerkorian, 
has officially put a for-sale sign up in front of his UA division. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview Monday, Ladd did not exclude the possibility that his 
financial backers would purchase that studio. "I don't think (that will happen) 
at this point in time," he said. "But anything's possible." Parretti is also 
rumored to be interested in the assets of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, 
which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a common ownership, Ladd said his new company will have no connection 
to the beleaguered Cannon studio, which reported a $21.6-million loss in the 
third quarter. Parretti took control of Cannon last April after agreeing to 
inject $100 million into the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ladd said that as chairman of Pathe Entertainment he plans to produce about 
four films a year with a range of budgets. He said he is negotiating with a 
major studio to distribute Pathe Entertainment's films. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Ladd -- best known for ushering "Star Wars" through 20th 
Century-Fox when he was president of that studio -- will ensure Parretti and 
Fiorini a much higher profile in Hollywood. Unlike Cannon, Ladd brings with him 
lengthy and strong ties in the established film community. "Laddie has talent 
and know-how, and he gets along with high-class people," said producer Jere 
Henshaw, a former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Properties 
</P>
<P>
Parretti has a variety of business interests in Europe, including banking, 
insurance, real estate and tourism. He recently acquired Pathe France, a 
communication company with a history as a prominent film studio. 
</P>
<P>
But the Italian financier has indicated a desire to expand his business 
interests in Southern California. Parretti recently purchased an $8.9-million 
home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Parretti had been pursuing Ladd since September, when Ladd 
resigned from MGM. At the time, Ladd attributed his departure to uncertainty 
surrounding the studio's future. But he also was known to be angered by 
Kerkorian's cost-cutting moves, including the termination of contracts with 
several prominent producers closely allied to Ladd. 
</P>
<P>
Ladd will be joined in his new venture by Jay Kanter, who resigned his position 
as production president at MGM several weeks ago. Kanter, along with Gareth 
Wigan, formed a partnership with Ladd in 1979 called the Ladd Co. That company 
released such films as "The Right Stuff," "Chariots of Fire," "Blade Runner" 
and "Once Upon a Time in America." 
</P>
<P>
Another Ladd protege, marketing president Greg Morrison, was fired from MGM/UA 
last week. There is, as yet, no word on whether Morrison will join the new 
venture.

American Brands Inc. reported record 1988 profit of $580 million, up 11% from a 
year ago. Revenue rose to $12 billion, up 19%. The Old Greenwich, Conn., firm, 
which is a holding company with businesses in tobacco, distilled spirits and 
life insurance, attributed the results to broad strength in all operations, as 
well as the favorable impact of an aggressive restructuring.

RJR REPORTS HIGHER PROFIT; 
</P>
<P>
KKR AGREES TO SELL SOME LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., moving closer to approval of its 
record-breaking, $24.5-billion takeover of RJR Nabisco, said Monday that it has 
tentatively agreed with antitrust officials to sell off some duplicate brands. 
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary agreement, either RJR Nabisco or Beatrice Cos., of which 
KKR controls about 90%, would sell off its brand in several product categories: 
ketchup, packaged nuts and Oriental entrees, noodles, vegetables and soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco, based in Atlanta, makes Del Monte ketchup, Planters peanuts and 
Oriental products under the Chun King name. Chicago-based Beatrice owns Hunt's 
ketchup, Fisher nuts and LaChoy. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement was reached with staff members of the Federal Trade 
Commission. The full commission is expected to rule on the matter in the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
One professor of economics described the accord as an example of the 
government's "swallowing the camel and straining at the gnats." 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have two of the biggest food and beverage companies . . . merging, 
and the government boldly chases cashew nuts," said James W. Brock, who teaches 
at Miami University of Ohio and is co-author of a 1987 book on antitrust and 
competition called "The Bigness Complex." 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers speculated that any sales of product lines, which KKR would 
be required to make within a year, ultimately might mean that entire units 
would be sold. In fact, KKR has already acknowledged that it expects to sell $6 
billion of RJR food operations during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just sell the Del Monte ketchup label and continue to support Del 
Monte canned fruit," said Stephen M. Carnes, a food industry analyst with the 
Minneapolis investment firm of Piper Jaffray Inc. "So if you're going to sell 
Del Monte or Hunt's, you will have to sell the whole brand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Realize $700 Million 
</P>
<P>
Carnes speculated that the sales of three lines such as Del Monte, Chun King 
and Planters might garner KKR $500 million to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McCready, director of the brand identity group for Landor Associates, a San 
Francisco consultant, speculated that KKR would sell Fisher rather than 
Planters because the Planters name is better known among consumers and is 
associated with a broader product line. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, the Del Monte name "logically could be extended into 
several additional categories, (whereas) Hunt's to most people basically means 
tomato products." Since Del Monte already markets foods such as fruit, pickles 
and snacks, KKR "would be reluctant to lose a piece of the line." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, Chun King might more logically be divested because Beatrice 
already sold the frozen food chunk of that line to ConAgra. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, RJR Nabisco Inc., reporting annual earnings as a public company for 
what is expected to be the last time, said Monday that its net income rose for 
the fourth quarter and the year despite high costs related to its takeover. 
</P>
<P>
For 1988, earnings climbed 15% to $1.4 billion. They were reduced by about $100 
million for advisory fees and other expenses related to the buyout. Sales rose 
8% to $17 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter's net income rose 11% to $411 million, and sales rose to $4.7 
billion from $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding increased tax provisions and expenses related to the merger, 
fourth-quarter net income would have been $539 million. The company said 
special tax charges for foreign operations also reduced the year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite declines in smoking in the United States, the company's tobacco 
business remained highly profitable because of higher retail prices for 
cigarettes and strong foreign sales.

EMPLOYERS' COST FOR HEALTH-CARE PLANS RISES SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of employer-sponsored health-care plans leaped 18.6% per worker last 
year after two years of single-digit increases, according to a survey released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Employers ran out of fresh ways to keep a lid on health costs after managing to 
limit their rise to 7.7% in 1986 and 7.9% in 1987, according to A. Foster 
Higgins &amp; Co., which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"The providers of care have gotten wise to some of the tricks and are 
compensating for it," John Erb, the managing consultant who conducted the 
survey for the New York-based benefits consulting firm, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost per employee of health care plans was $2,354 in 1988, up from 
$1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than 1,600 employers, whose 
plans cover 10 million workers and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The figures include the cost of plans to both employers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
The medical-care component of the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 
6.9% last year, making it the fastest-growing part of the inflation measure. 
But the cost of services is only part of the problem for employers and 
employees, Erb said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Erb, these were some of the factors in last year's big jump: 
</P>
<P>
* Doctors are getting around controls on their hospital fees by shifting more 
work to an outpatient basis, where there are no restrictions on the fees they 
can charge. 
</P>
<P>
* Doctors are requiring more follow-up visits, some of which may not be 
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
* Expensive medical services such as heart and liver transplants are becoming 
more widely available, so more people are using them. 
</P>
<P>
* The federal and state governments, strapped for money, are holding down how 
much they pay health-care providers for Medicare and Medicaid patients. That 
forces the providers to raise their prices to other customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is double-digit inflation back in health plans, there doesn't appear 
to be much relief in sight," Erb said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Ring, chairman of the American Medical Assn., said in response that he 
did not see any evidence that doctors were reaping big fee increases from the 
shift to outpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, a family physician in Mundelein, Ill., also said he would like to see 
statistics backing up Erb's claim that doctors were requiring medically 
unnecessary follow-up visits. Erb said he did not have such statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 increase was smallest, 15.6%, for companies with fewer than 1,000 
employees, which usually pay for their plans through insurers.

FCC DELAYS DECISION ON AT&amp;T PRICE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, acknowledging 
concerns on Capitol Hill about a proposal to revamp the way AT&amp;T sets its 
prices for interstate services, on Monday postponed a decision on the plan 
until March. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the FCC on a so-called rate cap method of pricing for American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance services had been scheduled for 
Monday. But after members of Congress said the FCC may not have legal authority 
to make such a change, Patrick issued a statment before the meeting saying that 
he would defer a vote until March to give lawmakers more time to study the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the importance of this docket, the complexity of the docket and in order 
to accommodate the interest in some additional briefings and the provision of 
some additional briefing information, I have agreed to reschedule this item for 
the meeting on March 16," Patrick said at Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Acted Wisely' 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is very important for the commission to draft regulations which 
will improve the incentives that are facing dominant carriers," Patrick said. 
"On the other hand, the Congress is intensely interested in this docket. . . . 
I would hope that in the spirit of the new Administration that we can use this 
as a foundation to establish a more constructive dialogue with members on both 
sides of the aisle with respect to this matter and other matters that are 
pending before the commission." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, which oversees telecommunications matters, welcomed Patrick's 
decision to delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the commission acted wisely," Dingell, who had criticized the FCC 
proposal, said in a statement. "The Congress had a number of concerns about the 
impact of the price caps proposal, and the FCC appears to be addressing them. 
As the details of the plan receive public scrutiny and go through the 
congressional hearing process, I hope the spirit of cooperation with Congress 
will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed AT&amp;T a certain profit 
beyond its costs. But the FCC proposed replacing this so-called rate-of-return 
regulation for "dominant carriers" such as AT&amp;T with ceilings on prices. 
That would include the seven regional Bell companies that AT&amp;T spun off in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said its proposal would encourage greater efficiency and 
innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four years if all the dominant 
companies participated. The FCC last May proposed that AT&amp;T be allowed to 
raise rates 3% less than annual inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skeptical Lawmakers 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said in a statement that it was "disappointed and frustrated" by 
Patrick's deferral and that every day a decision was delayed, "the public 
loses." 
</P>
<P>
BellSouth, one of the seven regional phone companies that would be affected by 
the new pricing scheme, said, "The commission appears to have stepped away from 
an opportunity to save telephone users billions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Another regional company, Bell Atlantic, said, "We are sorely disappointed that 
the FCC and Congress have been unable to resolve their differences over how to 
best implement a price cap plan that will benefit consumers, the 
telecommunications industry and the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had been skeptical of the new plan.

SmithKline Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckmann, 
has canceled a licensing and research and development contract with San 
Diego-based Synbiotics, the companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation did not affect "activities in anti-idiotypic antibodies, the 
core technology of the company," Synbiotics President Edward Maggio said 
Monday. "Our animal health programs are similarly unaffected by this 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The SmithKline Diagnostics contract was "our vehicle for entry into the 
physicians' office diagnostic market," Maggio said. "This was a spinoff or 
outgrowth of what we mainly do in our labs. . . . . It was not a major thrust 
of our research and development." 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline had made license payments to Synbiotics of $850,000, Maggio said. 
Synbiotics used the initial funding to expand its manufacturing space and hire 
new employees, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see an enormous impact on the company," Maggio said. "We have to 
examine implications internally and make some changes in how projects are 
staffed. There will be some reassignments." 
</P>
<P>
Maggio said the cancellation might be linked to top-level management changes at 
SmithKline Diagnostics, where the president recently resigned, and at 
SmithKline Beckmann, the parent company, where the chief operating officer 
recently left. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies will meet next month to discuss additional payments required 
by the agreement, Maggio said. GREG JOHNSON

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A buying frenzy that began last Tuesday helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
gain back the last of the 500 points lost in the October, 1987, crash, 
according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow continued to move ahead last week, gaining 88.75, or 3.9%. Some San 
Diego stocks -- particularly the financials -- joined in the advance, Katz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Bancorp led the financial sector as it climbed $1.50 to $5.25 on an 
acquisition offer by Security Pacific and a stock swap valued at $6 a share. 
The offer must be approved by regulators and Southwest's board of directors and 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
First National Corp. reached a new high of $12 after reporting excellent 
earnings of $1.18 for the year, up from $.70 the previous year. BSD Bancorp 
gained $.25. BSD is selling at six times earnings and only 66% of book value, 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of San Diego's savings and loans participated in the week's gains, Katz 
said. Home Federal, which has yet to release 1988 earnings, was up $1.25, and 
Great American First Savings Bank was up $.375, despite reporting earnings 
below those of the same quarter a year ago. Great American is selling at below 
book value and returning a dividend of 5.1%, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America recorded a new low of $6.875. ICA eliminated its $.15 
cent dividend and announced a reduction in 1988 earnings that was attributed to 
various write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data reached a new high of $10.75 on second-quarter earnings that rose 
by 47% to $.22, up from $.15. 
</P>
<P>
Other good movers last week included Xytronyx, up $1.375 after receiving an 
order for 50,000 periodontal disease detection kits from Colgate. Intermark was 
up $.875, responding to a favorable article in Business Week magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Other stocks moving up this week were San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, up $1.50; 
Henley Group, up $3.25; Price Co., up $1.50, and Rohr Industries, up $1.375. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham Pacific Properties successfully sold 1.5 million shares at $18.625.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Record average prices were set for both single-family houses and condominiums 
in the Santa Clarita Valley during December. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Santa Clarita Valley Board of Realtors, the average house 
price reached $207,700 in December, a 20% increase from the December, 1987, 
average of $173,880. A total of 218 houses were sold in December. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium prices, meanwhile, climbed 10% to $113,068 in December compared to 
the December, 1987, average of $103,200. A total of 102 condominiums were sold 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, the average house price was a record $191,100, an 18% jump 
from the 1987 average of $162,400. A total 2,388 houses were sold last year, a 
12% increase from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 792 condominiums were sold, a 32% jump from 1987 sales, while the 
average condominium price of $107,650 last year marked an 11% increase from the 
1987 average of $97,340. 
</P>
<P>
The board's survey includes sales of houses and condominiums by its members in 
the area from Val Verde to Acton, and does not include sales of new residences, 
which are generally sold without a real estate agent.

SUPERCHARGED SECOND WIND; 
</P>
<P>
ENGINE ACCESSORY BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO FIRM BOGGED DOWN BY SLOW SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six summers ago, Jim Davis, president of B&amp;M Automotive Products in 
Chatsworth, settled into the driver's seat of a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle and 
stomped on the gas pedal. Under the hood was a supercharger, a pump that forces 
extra air into the engine and can boost the horsepower by 40% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
He still remembers the exhilarating speed and raw power. "The first thing that 
impressed me was that when you just barely touched the throttle, you could 
literally feel the horsepower," said Davis, 54. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, B&amp;M needed some extra oomph. The 30-year-old company had 
carved a successful niche by selling sophisticated automatic transmission kits 
that helped turn ordinary sedans into weekend drag-racers, but plenty of 
competitors had sprung up during the last decade, and B&amp;M's sales were 
stuck in neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former record-holding drag-racer and advertising executive, needed to 
rev up B&amp;M's sales, and the supercharger did just that. The privately owned 
company started selling its supercharger in late 1983. Since then, the 
company's total annual sales have more than doubled, and last year 
superchargers accounted for 18% of B&amp;M's $16.5 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
In all, B&amp;M has sold about 12,000 of the units, which retail from $1,200 to 
$2,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have predicted the size of the initial sales," said Pat Ganahl, 
editor of Rod and Custom Magazine. "It was astronomical -- totally unheard of 
in this industry. The total number of superchargers sold previous to that would 
be probably in the hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M has "the best-selling supercharger," said Marlan Davis, technical 
editor of Hot Rod Magazine. "B&amp;M has gone through the trouble of 
engineering different kits for different cars." 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M is not the only manufacturer of superchargers, nor are B&amp;M's models 
the most high-tech on the market. But B&amp;M's superchargers are 
overwhelmingly the most popular, and they have been designed to fit on a wide 
variety of models, including various Chevrolet, Ford, Buick, Chrysler and 
Toyota engines. 
</P>
<P>
Before Californians rush out to buy superchargers, they should know that 
B&amp;M's superchargers are not legal for street use on any American cars made 
after 1965 because they have not been granted exemptions from emission control 
laws by the state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this doesn't deter the hard-core enthusiasts who buy them, promising 
that they will be used off-road, and then put them on street cars. "We don't 
advocate it," B&amp;M's Davis said. He said B&amp;M plans to obtain Air 
Resources Board exemptions for an upcoming supercharger that will fit 
late-model cars and work with factory fuel-injection systems. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's success boils down to a new application of a technology that was 
established in the 1920s. Superchargers were used on such vintage luxury cars 
as Cords and Duesenburgs, but the technology all but disappeared in the 1960s 
when Detroit found that it was easier to attain comparable power by simply 
making bigger engines. 
</P>
<P>
Superchargers, or blowers, as they are also known, are the under-the-hood 
equivalents of the blow dryer. Installed on top of the intake manifold where 
the engine "breathes" and linked to the crankshaft by pulleys and belts, the 
supercharger rams more air into an engine. 
</P>
<P>
The result can be dramatic. Adding a B&amp;M supercharger to a factory-stock, 
180-horsepower Camaro engine would boost its horsepower to 250 and trim the 
time that it takes to cover a quarter-mile by about 1.3 seconds, according to 
George Wallace, B&amp;M's director of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
There are two markets for superchargers: drivers between 19 and 45 years old 
who want their cars and trucks to look impressive under the hood and go faster, 
and those who need the added power to haul big loads, such as tradesmen and 
recreational-vehicle owners. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for B&amp;M's success is that it came up with a compact 
supercharger. For years, modified truck superchargers have been used to propel 
professional 2,500-horsepower drag-racing cars. But it was rare for a car on 
the street to have one, and it was necessary to cut a hole in the hood for the 
supercharger to fit. B&amp;M's superchargers, however, nestle comfortably 
underneath many hoods, affording drivers extra power without drawing unwanted 
attention from police. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's superchargers come with 30 pages of detailed installation and 
maintenance instructions. Somebody who doesn't know how to change a spark plug 
isn't going to want to tackle the installation, but a mechanic can do the job 
for about $700. 
</P>
<P>
The supercharger's lure, of course, is speed. Robert Bartholomew, a 47-year-old 
welder from Minnesota, installed a B&amp;M supercharger on his 1979 Chevrolet 
show car last spring. He spent 2 1/2 hours bolting the supercharger onto the 
Camaro's 400-cubic-inch engine. 
</P>
<P>
"After I put the blower on, it was unimaginable," Bartholomew said. He once got 
the supercharged Camaro up to 150 m.p.h. before he backed off because the 
handling got so dicey, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Turbocharging, a technology similar to superchargers, has become a popular, 
factory-installed option on everything from $9,000 Chevrolet Sprints to $75,000 
Porsches. Turbos have small propeller-like compressor wheels driven by the 
exhaust flow that forces additional air into the engine. 
</P>
<P>
But there is concern about the reliability of turbos. The turbos' turbines spin 
at up to 120,000 r.p.m. and can generate temperatures of 350 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M had investigated making turbochargers, but Davis was underwhelmed. "The 
biggest drawback is that turbochargers work at higher r.p.m. and the reality is 
that 90% of the time, you're driving at under 3,000" r.p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M discussed selling an existing supercharger made by another company. But 
"our chief engineer said we could build our own at half the cost and they would 
be twice as good," Davis said. So B&amp;M came up with its own design. 
</P>
<P>
For all of its merits, a supercharger can tax an engine because owners tend to 
drive the cars harder. The supercharger's Achilles heel is detonation, or 
"pinging," and a proper tuneup is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Although superchargers have boosted B&amp;M's sales, two-thirds -- or $11 
million -- of its sales last year stemmed from various automatic transmission 
products: torque converters, shifters and shift kits. Davis figures that 
B&amp;M has 90% of the market for automatic transmissions sold in the United 
States to the so-called "aftermarket," made up of car buffs who tinker with 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
The company's hottest-selling automatic transmission shifter retails for about 
$170. Called the Megashifter, it's popular because it looks and works like the 
more traditional "four-on-the-floor" shifter found on manual transmissions. For 
the weekend drag-racer, the Megashifter and other top-line B&amp;M shifters 
enable a racer to shift gears manually for optimum acceleration. Last year, 
B&amp;M sold $5.9 million worth of shifters, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's ties to drag-racing are nearly as old as the company. B&amp;M was 
started in Van Nuys in 1953 as an auto-repair garage by Bob Spar and Mort 
Shulman. Spar's brother, Don, bought out Shulman's share shortly thereafter. 
B&amp;M evolved into a transmission specialty shop after the Spar brothers 
began winning races with their Oldsmobile, which had a four-speed automatic 
transmission that they modified and later put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The company kept growing, but by the 1970s, the Spars were investing nearly all 
of their time in a now-defunct motor-home company, and B&amp;M's business 
suffered. In 1973, the brothers asked Davis, a former National Hot Rod Assn. 
record-holder who ran his own Detroit advertising agency, to run things. 
</P>
<P>
Davis came up with snazzy names for the shifters and transmission kits, and 
rewrote B&amp;M's instruction sheets to make them easier to understand. But his 
key move was shifting B&amp;M's marketing focus from drag-racers to street 
enthusiasts. "For every drag-racer, there's a thousand street freaks," he said. 
And in 1987, the company expanded its product distribution to such major retail 
auto parts chains as Pep Boys and Chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim brings a business approach to an industry that's probably made up of guys 
who are not businessmen but are designers and racers and are hands-on guys," 
said Richard Paul, an engineer and owner of Latham Supercharger Co. 
</P>
<P>
Anytime Davis and B&amp;M's executives want hands-on experience, they don't 
have to go far. "This is the toy room," Davis said with a smile as he opened 
the door to a spacious garage, just a few steps from his office. 
</P>
<P>
Davis shows off his company's newest project cars -- a low-slung Chevrolet 
Camaro IROC-Z, a 1932 Ford roadster and a supercharged Ford Mustang that is 
being developed in conjunction with Ford Motorsport. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to keeping B&amp;M rolling is a constant stream of new products, he 
said, and the company spends 3% of its sales on research and development. But 
Davis also relies on some seat-of-the-pants evaluation. He likes to take a car 
out and step on the gas.

VALLEY EARNINGS: FLAMEMASTER REVISES PER-SHARE EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flamemaster Corp., a Sun Valley maker of flame-retardant coatings and seals, 
revised downward its previously reported per-share earnings for its past two 
fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
Flamemaster said it actually earned 25 cents a share for the year that ended 
Sept. 30, 1988, and 8 cents for the fourth quarter, instead of the previously 
reported 28 cents and 11 cents, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous year, Flamemaster's profit was 23 cents for the year and and 7 
cents for the quarter, compared with the previously reported 28 cents and 10 
cents, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Flamemaster said it revised the results to correct an error in how it treated 
certain dividends when it computed the earnings per common share. The company's 
overall net income for all the periods involved was not affected.

 Richard P. Reinhardt is resigning as deputy director of the California Student 
Aid Commission to become vice president for administration at United Education 
&amp; Software, an Encino company that operates a chain of trade schools. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt, 42, has been with the CSAC since 1983. The state agency guarantees, 
on behalf of the federal government, loans to students made by private 
financial institutions, such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment at UES is effective March 13. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the CSAC and other regulatory agencies discovered problems at a UES 
subsidiary that serviced about $1 billion in government-backed student loans. 
The joint investigation, which uncovered problems in UES' ability to service 
some of the loans correctly, prompted the company to shed the student-loan 
processing business and led to UES' $4.47-million loss for the nine months 
ended Oct. 31.

GLOBETROTTERS STILL AHEAD OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Harlem Globetrotters were in town over the weekend to show us how, at 63, 
they haven't aged a bit, and in fact are more than au courant: 
</P>
<P>
The Globies carry a woman on the roster, they play above the rim, and Twiggy 
Sanders' Bingo shot -- a 40-foot hook from the sideline -- may yet find an 
expert practitioner in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The rosters have changed, of course. Show Biz Jackson and the 6-foot-9 Sanders 
now take up the slack of those earlier antic showmen, Goose Tatum and 
Meadowlark Lemon, and young Tyrone Brown takes care of the dribbler's 
legerdemain that was once the incomparable province of Marques Haynes and Curly 
Neal. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the old crowd-pleasing tricks remain. The swift, ever-tightening 
weave at the top of the key, where the ball is popped in to the center who 
kicks it or passes it or bounces it off his head to a cutter who in turn 
finishes with a Hi Slamma Jamma dunk. The trick balls. The long pauses where 
Sanders may toss a vendor's entire supply of Cracker Jacks into the crowd and 
then ask of him "Do you take checks? Good. I'll check with you later." The play 
with children (an eager 5-year-old boy is fetched center court, changed into a 
Globetrotters uniform while the players hold towels discreetly around him, then 
returned to his father, whom Sanders tries to dun for $15 -- which remains 
amicably unpaid). 
</P>
<P>
The Globetrotters play as much as eight games a week -- a crushing schedule 
(NBA teams average three) -- yet for a few minutes of each quarter we get to 
see some very good basketball. The defense of the Washington Generals (the 
Globies' opponents) may be a bit sketchy, but it's clear that the script is 
only partly blocked out and that the players are allowed to spend some time 
really going at it. 
</P>
<P>
Their pleasure -- the inner game -- is in putting moves on each other, 
challenging each other, and there are times when we witness the almost 
breathtakingly beautiful sweep of fine-tuned young players taking a fast break 
downcourt, arcing and cutting like gazelles in an orchestrated stampede that 
climaxes in someone's gorgeous leap to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball may have started as a white game, but once blacks began playing it 
quickly became clear that whites would have to be very good to keep up (and for 
a while they weren't; that's why the Globetrotters went on their own -- they'd 
been frozen out). When we struggle for similes at the sight of an electrifying 
Magic Johnson pass or an Air Jordan glide to the hoop, for a second we always 
think that the miracle belongs in a Globetrotter game. 
</P>
<P>
Only the other night Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: "I grew up in Harlem. I didn't 
know anything about the Lakers or the Celtics when I was a kid. I only knew the 
Globetrotters." 
</P>
<P>
If the game weren't enough, they're also skillful and affectionate clowns who 
find every opportunity to play the crowd. During the intros, Sanders grows 
bored with waiting for his name to be announced and steps off-court to swipe 
somebody's box of nachos and sodas, which he redistributes to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
There is black patois ("Who ball?" Jackson inquires of the referee); ironic 
elegance (ref calls for ball, player responds, "Are you inquiring about the 
availability of a ball?"); impromptu dancing (Tyrone Brown moonwalks through 
the key), and endless improvisatory surprise, whether in low-fiving a youngster 
who can't reach a 7-footer's high-five, or in forming a swift ensemble that 
rushes to either side of the court en masse -- drawing the opposition along -- 
and then leaving the ball behind for a deliberately tardy teammate to scoop to 
the basket. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that makes a Globetrotters appearance a treat is that the 
players themselves are always in search of the adroit move (stocky young 
Quentin Jackson's eyes scanned his own bench after a particularly clever flight 
to the hoop, after which he curled downcourt doing an Ickey Woods finger 
twirl). 
</P>
<P>
Another is that they're such expert practitioners of the game that they can toy 
with its form. There are so many millions of dollars at stake in an NBA 
franchise's season that there isn't always a lot of room for fun (Lakers' show 
time excepted), and the intercollegiate game is even duller. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the Globetrotters to remind us that at the heart of real play 
there's discipline, and at the heart of discipline there's always the freedom 
to play. If they weren't so adept at the structure of the game, turning it 
around, parodying it, they'd be unwatchable. To the extent that theirs could be 
called a deconstructivist approach, they remain at one with the age. (You can 
just hear an incredulous Sanders now: "Say what?") 
</P>
<P>
If the rule of comedy is invention, who would have thought that six decades 
into what is now an institutional franchise, the Globetrotters are still ahead 
of the game?

RAISING THEIR VOICES TO AID ARMENIAN ORPHANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BURMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 show business celebrities -- from Charles Aznavour to Pia Zadora 
-- gathered in a Hollywood recording studio Sunday to do for the victims of 
last month's devasting earthquake in Soviet Armenia what pop music stars have 
done for starving Ethiopians, bankrupt American farmers and AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Although names such as Liza Minnelli, Ben Vereen, Steve Lawrence, Dionne 
Warwick and others who met to record "For You, Armenia," may be more identified 
with Las Vegas showrooms than rock 'n' roll arenas, they sang and spoke of 
their cause with equal passion. 
</P>
<P>
And passion was the principal commodity among the group -- officially dubbed 
Friend to Friend -- for their efforts to raise money and send supplies to the 
quake region are still in their earliest stages. 
</P>
<P>
A related European effort to send help is already under way, but the Americans 
have no distributor for the record cut on Sunday and no network or syndicator 
has agreed to broadcast a special based on the session. 
</P>
<P>
But the group does have Aznavour, the noted French composer whose parents were 
from Armenia. He spearheaded Sunday's effort and co-wrote the song the 
celebrities recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moved by what happened and I wanted to do it for the children, so many 
of whom are now orphans," said Aznavour. "I hope to raise enough money, 
minimum, to support the thousands of homeless children." 
</P>
<P>
Aznavour's efforts began shortly after the Dec. 7 quake. He and George 
Garvarentz composed a version of the song in French and recorded it a few weeks 
ago with a collection of European celebrities. Sales of that record raised 
enough for the relief group to send 40 tons of supplies and 10 dialysis 
machines to Armenia, Aznavour said. 
</P>
<P>
The people who gathered to make the U.S. version of the record are hoping to 
create a constant pipeline of supplies to help the quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, some of whom brought their families, began arriving around noon 
and were herded into a Paramount Pictures sound stage. Many hugged and kissed 
each other and some spoke with newspaper and TV reporters on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the day of the Lord, and what better way to let people know I care?" 
said Vereen. "We are forgetting about differences of color, language, political 
ideology, and planting a seed as brothers and sisters for a greater force. 
We're not sending bombs, but coming together through music." 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a God-given talent, you help," said Minnelli. "I'm speaking more 
in a spiritual sense than in a religious sense. When I saw the disaster in 
Armenia, I thought I was going to die. Besides, when Charles Aznavour calls and 
says you can help, you go." 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of the schoolchildren I met over in the Soviet Union and the 
devastation that's going on there now, it's such a tragedy," said "Head of the 
Class" actress Khrystyne Haje, who traveled to Moscow last year to shoot an 
episode of the ABC situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Hollywood celebrities was Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
husband of absent Jane Fonda who didn't go to the session. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been involved with a lot of things in the Legislature for Armenia 
previous to this effort, and now, with this, I think you find a solidarity 
among the people that shows we cannot forget those around us," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great that the government gets involved," said comedian Wil 
Shriner, "but really, everything starts with the people." 
</P>
<P>
After about 90 minutes of meeting and talking, record producer Michael Masser 
led the celebrities to the nearby studio to begin rehearsals of the song. 
</P>
<P>
As the group began recording, director Peter Bogdanovich was weaving his 
cameras in and out of the studio. He was shooting the planned video and TV 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, the singers were hitting their stride, belting out the 
anthem-like lyrics of the tune: 
</P>
<P>
 Your children will 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild for you ... 
</P>
<P>
 For you Armenia 
</P>
<P>
 The world is by your side 
</P>
<P>
 We know you will survive 
</P>
<P>
 We've opened our arms 
</P>
<P>
 You've opened up our hearts. 
</P>

ABRAMS ALWAYS SEEKING NEW FRONTIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have always been inspired to look for better ways to do basic things within 
myself and (by) a desire to deal with music itself so style is not something 
that is a determinant," declared Muhal Richard Abrams, the acclaimed 
pianist-composer who opens a six-night engagement at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill 
in Hollywood tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Music itself is the determinant (factor) so I may be found in a blues suit or 
I may be found in a new music suit. I like a lot of things so it's very 
difficult for me to settle in one place and not investigate different things." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams, 58, is widely credited as the catalyst for the 1965 formation of the 
Assn. for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the influential Chicago-based 
collective with a roster of alumni -- saxophonist Anthony Braxton and the Art 
Ensemble of Chicago, among others -- constituting a virtual "Who's Who" of the 
last two decades' experimental jazz musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Catalina performance is his Los Angeles-area appearance since the 1982 Kool 
Jazz Festival. He will be performing with a stellar quartet featuring John 
Purcell (reeds), Fred Hopkins (bass) and Andrew Cyrille (drums). 
</P>
<P>
Abrams' varied music has ranged from solo piano performances to compositions 
for large ensembles, and pieces with a near-chamber music orientation to 
straight-ahead homages to Swing Era bandleaders and Chicago bluesmen. He 
relishes the challenge of working in multiple musical contexts. 
</P>
<P>
"You fit the situation to the situation, so to speak," said Abrams from his New 
York home. "If you're dealing with a trio -- three colors -- you mix those 
three colors. You don't think in terms of other colors being missing; you deal 
with that which is there. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams, a Chicago native, began his professional music career in 1948. During 
the '50s, he played behind numerous jazz artists in Chicago and recorded one 
album with his own MJT+3 group. 
</P>
<P>
With his compositions growing more adventurous and no outlets for performing 
them in Chicago, Abrams formed his Experimental Band in 1961. That unit 
gradually evolved into the Assn. for Creative Musicians, which was officially 
formed in May, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"The collective idea was what we set out to accomplish, in the sense that it 
would showcase the individuals and allow them a venue for projecting their 
invention," Abrams said. "It started as a collection of people who felt a need 
to build a forum to present things to humanity that would otherwise have 
probably gone unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams' first recording as a leader, "Levels and Degrees of Light," was 
released on Delmark in 1967. His next album, the 17th of his career, features 
an 18-piece group and will be released later this year on the Black Saint 
label. And Abrams continues the personal musical studies that reach back to the 
earliest jazz piano pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you ever finish studying Art Tatum and James P. Johnson?" he asked. "I 
look in every nook and cranny because I can never hope to bring it all out of 
there so I take what I can take and use it in the best way I can. It's a 
continuum that is going on -- I'm sure they did the same thing."

ACCIDENTAL GUNSHOT TO HEAD KILLS MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man died after he accidently shot himself in the head, police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Family members of Jose Rojas, 19, called police about 9:45 p.m. Sunday to 
report that he was brandishing a .357-caliber handgun outside his home in the 
1100 block of West Walnut Street, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they found Rojas lying on the ground with a fatal gunshot 
wound to the head, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Family members and neighbors told police that they heard only one shot before 
Rojas was discovered. They told police that Rojas had been drinking and had 
been firing the gun all day. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said there was no evidence that Rojas intended to commit suicide, so 
police are calling the shooting accidental, pending further investigation.

UCI PROGRAM TARGETS PRE-COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A college preparatory program will be offered by UC Irvine this summer for 
gifted junior high and high school students who qualify in what UCI called a 
"talent search." 
</P>
<P>
Students with exceptional math, verbal or overall academic ability are being 
sought for the first-time program, said Jim Waldron, the program's director in 
the UCI Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, students in grades 7-12 must score as well as or better than the 
average high school senior on either the SAT or the SCAT examination. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for registration for the SAT -- the Scholastic Aptitude Test for 
college admission -- is Friday, although late registration is permitted until 
Feb. 15, and students may be able to take the test as walk-ins at test sites, 
Waldron said. 
</P>
<P>
The final day for registering for the SCAT -- a shortened version of the SAT, 
which is not used for college admission -- is Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Classes will be taught by UCI professors, who will include such subjects as 
international relations, critical thinking and writing, physics, jazz-dance, 
sailboating and college survival. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very selective program for high-achieving students," Waldron said. 
"Our goal is to offer especially stimulating educational experiences not 
usually available to these students." 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must pay a $15 fee. In addition, tuition for the 5-week session -- 
offered June 26 to Aug. 3 for high school students -- is $585. High school and 
junior high students may enroll in the 3-week session, scheduled July 10-28, 
for $535. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarships are available. Students may commute or live in campus guest 
quarters with a chaperon. Minibus service is also available in Orange County.

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN CAR-POOL LANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tustin man was killed Monday when the motorcycle he was driving in a car-pool 
lane ran into a vehicle that had slowed on the Costa Mesa Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Darlington, 53, sustained fatal head injuries in the crash, which 
occurred at 7:55 a.m. south of Katella Avenue, CHP Officer Michael Lundquist 
said. Darlington was not wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Lundquist said a northbound 1982 Honda Accord driven by Robin Berilla, 33, of 
San Dimas was braking in slowing traffic when she lost control of the car and 
swerved into the car-pool lane. A second vehicle already in the car-pool lane 
hit the Honda, he said. When a third vehicle slowed to avoid the other two, 
Darlington's motorcycle struck it from behind, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The other drivers suffered minor injuries in the accident, which slowed traffic 
for about an hour in both directions, Lundquist said.

JOINT APPRENTICESHIPS PLANNED FOR BUS DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to cut training expenses and broaden recruitment, Orange County 
Transit District bus drivers will be certified through a new joint 
apprenticeship program involving Rancho Santiago College, district officials 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD is the first transit agency in the state to start such a program under 
state guidelines, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
After completing the apprenticeship, new drivers will receive state 
certification as journeymen coach operators. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD drivers now complete a 6-week internal training and certification program 
that qualifies inexperienced applicants as drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, Rancho Santiago College will provide money for OCTD's 
training of about 125 new drivers per year, as well as the retraining of the 
remaining 811 members of the transit district's driver work force. Then the 
state will reimburse the college for about $161,000, 77% of which will later be 
passed on to OCTD for recovery of its classroom rental costs, parking fees and 
a $2.50 tuition fee for each journeyman driver.

Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., on his fourth trip to Orange County in the 
last 2 months to campaign for state Democratic Party chairman, told local 
Democrats on Monday that he would not use the chairmanship to run for higher 
office. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Brown said that if he makes good on his promise to rebuild 
the Democratic Party and "if you want to call me to something else, I'll take 
the call. But I'm not running for anything." 
</P>
<P>
After 6 years away from California politics, during which time Brown studied 
and traveled, the former governor returned to the political fray several months 
ago in a surprise bid for the state chairmanship. An idea person, he has not 
been viewed as the nuts-and-bolts type needed to organize the party for voter 
registration, get-out-the-vote and other grass-roots efforts needed to win 
statewide elections. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown has campaigned for the leadership spot as if he were running for the 
U.S. Senate -- which he did in 1982 only to lose to former San Diego Mayor Pete 
Wilson. The party leadership election takes place at the state Democratic Party 
convention Feb. 10 to 12 in Sacramento. Brown said he has 1,500 people 
committed to him. About 2,800 Democrats are expected to attend the state 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, in a free-wheeling and often hilarious talk with about 80 
members of the County Democratic Central Committee, Brown said to erupting 
laughter and applause: "I'm beginning to like Orange County. And I think Orange 
County may start to like me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
While Brown lost in Orange County in the U.S. Senate race, he won a plurality 
for the governorship in 1978. Brown was addressing a group of party leaders who 
represent more than 400,000 Democrats but who are so out-numbered by 
Republicans in Orange County that they get little or no attention statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The former governor, who will return Friday for a Democratic Party gathering in 
Laguna Beach, promised to put resources into Orange County as a sort of 
"research and development" in order to rebuild the party. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm saying we can build the most powerful political party which allows 
more participation and more Democratic activism than ever before," Brown said. 
"And the result is going to be a solid Democratic triumph. That's my goal." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "If I don't do that . . . I'm not going to go very far forward. I'll 
have a hard time just hanging on by my fingernails." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Orange County party chairman Mike Balmages asked if there were any 
questions of Brown, the atmosphere was so light that party stalwart Richard J. 
O'Neill cracked, "Yeah, where'd he get that suit?" Brown, who was wearing a 
brown, double-breasted suit, indeed looked more like he was attending a 
partners' meeting in a major law firm than a local Democratic meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But on a more serious note, O'Neill commented after Brown's 22-minute talk that 
he believes that Brown will "put something back into the state party." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will put a lot of snap back in," O'Neill said. "Whether he's 
successful or not, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Brown tentatively supported the county party's plan to seek money from the 
state Democratic Party to finance a recall effort against Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
After a $2.2-million campaign, Pringle won the 72nd Assembly District seat last 
November over Democratic opponent Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach by 867 votes. 
But Democrats feel that the election was tainted because of the presence of 
uniformed security guards at 20 heavily Latino precincts in the 72nd District 
who they feel may have frightened away first-time Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Pringle's campaign, the guards were hired by the county 
Republican Party because of fears party leaders had that the Democratic Party 
would bus in illegal voters to tip the election in Thierbach's favor. Use of 
the guards caused an uproar not only among Democrats but in the Republican 
Party as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said, "If the facts justify it and if things work out right, I'll be glad 
to help out and do everything I can to make sure that your recall election that 
goes to the issue of the fraud and intimidation (on behalf of) Mr. Pringle does 
not go unnoticed or unchallenged." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown later fell short of an outright endorsement of the resolution when 
questioned by a reporter. "I'm very sympathetic, that's all I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he lost the state chairmanship whether he would "be around working 
with us for the next few years," Brown quipped: "No, I'm going back in the 
monastery." When the room broke into laughter, the former seminarian joked, 
"Because I know I've got something to expiate that I haven't finished with."

NADER WARNS PROP. 103 SEQUEL COULD BE AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, breathing fire against the insurance industry, 
said Monday at a Costa Mesa news conference that the backers of Proposition 103 
will organize another initiative drive in 1990 unless the goals of the measure 
are met before then. 
</P>
<P>
Nader, on his first visit to California since the passage of Proposition 103, 
the successful insurance initiative that he supported in the November election, 
spoke to reporters before a county dinner that a trial lawyers' committee and 
others gave in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry must realize that the people of California mean 
business," he said, going on to express disappointment that state Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and the Legislature have not been tougher in 
implementing the provisions of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Nader was particularly caustic about plans announced Monday by State Farm, 
California's largest seller of auto insurance, to raise auto policy rates by 
9.6% immediately for all customers. If the company is allowed to do that, he 
predicted, many other insurers will follow with "arbitrary, unjustified" rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Monday night's dinner at the Red Lion Inn, attended by about 800 
people, was to raise what sponsors said was more than $250,000 for two causes: 
the Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest and the Los Angeles Mission. 
</P>
<P>
Nader gave a largely inspirational speech, calling for citizen action to "usher 
in a better life for whoever comes after us." 
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to Californians for overcoming the financial power of the 
insurance industry in passing Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The recently established Shafeek Nader Trust is named after Nader's older 
brother, a community organizer who died of cancer at 60 in 1986. Nader said 
that money being raised for the trust would be used for pilot community-action 
projects in Winsted, Conn., Nader's hometown, where his brother had founded a 
community college and done other work. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Mission serves the poor and homeless with varied programs. 
</P>
<P>
The chief organizer of the dinner was Claremont trial lawyer Herbert Hafif, who 
recruited Nader last fall for a successful, last-minute, $500,000 advertising 
effort to defeat the insurance industry's Proposition 106, which would have 
limited trial lawyers' contingency fees. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif's call to trial lawyers and others in the dinner announcement to come to 
the fund-raiser prompted insurance lobbyists to suggest last week that the 
affair proves that Nader is closely identified with the interests of trial 
lawyers in the fight over the future of the insurance system. The lawyers 
derive much income at present from that system. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif said he was a dissident trial lawyer in the last campaign, not identified 
with the California Trial Lawyers Assn. and its sponsorship of Proposition 100, 
a less-sweeping reform initiative that competed unsuccessfully with Proposition 
103. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hafif said, on some issues Nader has a "marvelous identity" with 
trial lawyers. Several leaders of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. were in 
the audience Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said both he and "good" trial lawyers believe that the insurance industry 
ought to put much more effort into promoting driver safety and forcing the 
automobile industry to produce safer cars. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that many people who are not trial lawyers came to Monday night's 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said the opening stages of the Bush Administration did not give any cause 
for thinking that the new Republican President will be any more interested in 
consumer health and safety issues than was former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another 4 years for no law and order on health and safety questions," he 
predicted.

INVESTIGATION CLEARS CITY PLANNING AIDE OF BRIBERY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach Planning Department employee who was suspended last 
September pending an investigation of allegations of bribery and other 
improprieties has been cleared of serious wrongdoing, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Martinez, who checks building plans to ensure compliance with city 
codes, returned to work Monday following a 4-month suspension with pay, 
according to Mike Adams, the city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said allegations that Martinez had duped a builder into paying him $2,000 
to get construction plans approved in 1978 could not be substantiated in an 
investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade Monday declined to confirm that his office 
was involved in any investigation of the charges. Wade, who is in charge of 
special investigations for the district attorney's office, routinely declines 
to acknowledge investigations that do not result in criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told of Conflict 
</P>
<P>
Martinez did violate city personnel codes, Adams said, by approving plans for a 
room addition drawn by his wife, who operates a drafting business out of the 
couple's home. But Martinez had told his supervisor of the conflict at the 
time, according to Adams, who said the supervisor erred in telling Martinez to 
check the plans anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a 16-year city employee, said Monday that his lawyer, Zaiden R. 
Corrado, was notified by the district attorney's office that its investigation 
had turned up no proof of any bribe. He acknowledged that he had approved his 
wife's room plan but said that it only happened on one occasion and that her 
plan was treated no differently than others submitted. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a policy established in the department in which I was authorized to 
do that (work on his wife's plans) as long as those drawings were pointed out 
to the supervisor and double-checked," Martinez said. "That's what happened, 
and those drawings were in full compliance with city code. There was no 
preferential treatment in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 58, a former Cuban government architect who fled that country in 
1963, said the charges were investigated "fairly and professionally." He said 
he has been told that there will be no disciplinary action against him. 
Martinez studied architecture in Cuba but is not a licensed architect in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unnamed Developer 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a professional all my life, and things like this occasionally 
happen," he said. "It is water under the bridge now, and I am back without any 
resentment." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Corrado and Paul E. Cook, the city administrator, were 
unsuccessful Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the allegations originated with an unnamed developer, who claimed 
that he was tricked into writing a $2,000 check to Martinez at a time when his 
plans were subject to approval by Martinez. The developer, who had taken over a 
project from another builder and said he was unfamiliar with city procedures, 
was interviewed by Huntington Beach police and district attorney's 
investigators, but could provide no proof of the payment, according to Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer made a statement that he wrote a check," Adams said. "His 
statement was based on 10 years of memory, and he couldn't say whether it was 
paid to Sergio or someone else. He could not recall who he did business with. 
It was real vague." 
</P>
<P>
Adams confirmed that when he was Martinez's supervisor, until about 2 years 
ago, he knew of Doris Martinez's drafting business and required Martinez to 
inform him whenever a drawing done by his wife was submitted for approval. In 
the future, Martinez will have no involvement with work done by his wife, Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams attributed rumors of broad wrongdoing by Martinez to "personality 
conflicts" with other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has worked as the city's only plan checker with responsibility for 
ensuring that projects include sufficient parking spaces, are built the 
required distance from property lines and meet other non-structural 
requirements. Other Planning Department workers, as well as part-time 
employees, helped to absorb Martinez's duties during his suspension, Adams 
said.

FELLOW BRONCO FANS OFFER TO PAY FOR BLIND MAN'S SEASON TICKET 
</P>

<P>
After 22 years as a season-ticket holder for Denver Broncos games, Bobbie 
Shepard thought he had to sell out, but the 68-year-old blind man will be 
keeping his ticket, thanks to fellow Bronco fans. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard placed a classified ad in Sunday's Denver Post, offering to sell his 
45-yard-line season ticket because a recent price increase of $5 per ticket 
made the $300 cost too much for his income. 
</P>
<P>
But after a story in the Denver newspaper detailed his problem, Shepard's phone 
began ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one came at 6:30 in the morning," Shepard said. "I tried to eat my 
breakfast, but I couldn't get it eaten. Every time I took a bite the phone 
would ring again." 
</P>
<P>
By the time it stopped, Shepard had 15 offers to pay for his $300 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 a.m., Boulder lawyer Dan Caplis had arrived at Shepard's home and handed 
him a check for the $300, and offered to pay for the ticket every season 
Shepard wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to do it," Caplis said. "I think the Broncos need more fans like 
Bobbie. It just seemed to me that he was a gutsy, courageous guy, and he should 
be there. It only seems right." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to another offer, Shepard and his guide dog, Heidi, no longer will have 
to ride the bus to Bronco games. 
</P>
<P>
"A lady called and told me that her seats are just above mine, and that she and 
her husband had talked to me at some of the ballgames," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'It's wonderful the way you and your dog get around, but we don't 
live very far from you.' So she told me they would pick me up and take me to 
the games and bring me home." 
</P>
<P>
The whole experience left Shepard a little overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this shows there are a lot of good people out there," he said. "I'm so 
thankful. I don't really know what to say."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: THREE MORE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SAY THEY WILL PLAY FOR 
SDSU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State has received oral commitments from three more football players 
who say they will attend the school next season. 
</P>
<P>
The players are Marlon Andrews, a 5-foot 11-inch, 185-pound cornerback from 
Pasadena City College; Curt Pieson, a 6-4, 210-pound defensive end from 
Rubidoux High School in Riverside, and Romando Stallings, a 6-7, 260-pound, 
offensive/defensive lineman from Ansonia (Conn.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, who played at Muir High School in Pasadena, also visited Iowa State, 
Purdue and Tennessee. Pieson visited Arizona and Arizona State, and Stallings 
visited Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
The first day high school seniors can sign letters of intent is Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Lewis, a defensive back on the San Diego Section 3-A champion Morse 
High School football team last season, has made an oral commitment to attend 
Ohio State in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 6-2, 190-pound defensive back, also visited San Diego State, 
Washington and California before picking Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed Ohio State," Lewis said. "They have one of the best 
facilities I've ever seen, and their business program is excellent. I enjoyed 
the coaching staff and the players at Ohio State, and that's the place I felt I 
should go." 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Todd Jackson and safety Bryan Day were chosen top offensive and 
defensive players for the 1988 University of San Diego football season at the 
team's awards banquet Sunday at USD's University Center. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver/return specialist Ken Zampese won the special teams' honor, and 
defensive tackle David Gilmore won the strength coach's award. Offensive 
lineman Mike Cassady and nose guard Dave Dunn were chosen team captains. 
</P>
<P>
Day and defensive tackle John Gomez were presented with Academic All-American 
awards. Day was a first-team selection the past 2 seasons; Gomez was chosen to 
the second team. 
</P>

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
What will U.S. International University and Loyola Marymount do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, USIU Coach Gary Zarecky doesn't think the teams will equal the 
numbers of their first meeting when they play tonight at 7:30 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if the game is as high-scoring affair as the first 
time," Zarecky said. "After watching the video four and five times, I know that 
we can play better offensively, but I think LMU can play better defensively." 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined to set three NCAA records in Loyola's 162-144 victory in San 
Diego Jan. 7. Loyola set a record for most points in a half (93), and USIU set 
a record for most points by a losing team. The combined 306 points is a record 
for a regulation game. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (11-7) is the highest-scoring team in the nation and is coming off a 
99-86 victory over Pepperdine Sunday. USIU (8-13) has not played since Jan 18, 
when it defeated Division III UC San Diego, 106-89.

MISSOURI COACH EARNS THE BIG MAN ON CAMPUS AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DAVIS, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a little early to be passing out postseason awards, but this one won't 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart has locked up the Big Man On Campus Award. Everyone 
would agree it takes a truly Big Man to do what Stewart is accused of doing 
after his weekly news conference Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Thomas, the Missouri beat writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, said 
Stewart took him aside to discuss recent Post-Dispatch articles that Stewart 
felt were hurting him. Thomas told the Columbia Missourian that Stewart was 
calm at first, but then became agitated. Thomas said Stewart got up from his 
seat, pointed at him and said, "I know some people who can take care of your 
1-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was referring to Thomas' infant son, whom Stewart had seen earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart denied making any threatening remarks to Thomas and told the Missourian 
he only asked Thomas, "why he wanted to hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
In December the Post-Dispatch published a series of stories in which several 
Detroit-area coaches questioned the recruiting tactics of Missouri assistant 
coach Rich Daly. Missouri recently has recruited seven players from the Detroit 
area. 
</P>
<P>
David Lipman, managing editor for the Post-Dispatch, has filed a written 
complaint with Missouri Chancellor Haskell Monroe. Bob Pastin, the 
Post-Dispatch's executive sports editor, said Friday Missouri Athletic Director 
Dick Tamburo promised Jan. 19 that he would try to get Stewart together with 
Thomas to "hash things out." As of Friday, that meeting hadn't taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get a resolution," Pastin said. "I doubt if Norm will ever 
apologize. That would be like indicting himself." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is the winningest coach in Big Eight Conference history. Earlier this 
season, he picked up his 500th career victory. But, much like Indiana Coach Bob 
Knight, Stewart's winning record has led to an unrealistic sense of power on 
the Missouri campus. Stormin' Norman is notorious for this type of behavior, 
but is never challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart hasn't received national attention for his antics the way Knight has. 
Perhaps because Stewart's teams rarely make it past the first round of the NCAA 
Tournament, so he hasn't been in the national eye. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time Stewart has gone after a writer after what he felt 
was "negative" reporting. It is the first known case of Stewart threatening a 
baby. That's pretty sad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Stewart's denial, no one at Missouri has stepped forward and said, "I 
can't believe Norm would have said that." That may be the most telling 
indictment of all. 
</P>
<P>
Those 10 players who walked off the San Jose State team to protest the coaching 
methods of Billy Berry have hired San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli to 
represent them. Belli is charging the players $200 each. Belli said Berry is "a 
regular Hitler."

Top-ranked Torrey Pines High School defeated No. 3 Poway last week to help keep 
the top three positions intact in The Times' San Diego County boys' high school 
basketball rankings. Lincoln, the No. 2 team, and Torrey Pines are both 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego won twice last week to move the Cavers into top 10 for the first time 
this season. Point Loma dropped out of the rankings after league losses to 
Patrick Henry and Morse, two unranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
The top five teams are unchanged in the girls' poll. Ramona dropped to 10th, 
but San Marcos' entry gives the Avocado League three teams in the rankings.

CAL STATE FULLERTON MAKES OPENING BID WITHOUT ITS ACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is opening day for the Cal State Fullerton baseball team, but it will not be 
quite the way it was imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton was to start this season with a preseason All-American 
battery -- Mark Beck to throw the first pitch and Brent Mayne to catch it -- 
but it won't be that way today. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Danny DeVille, a right-hander who went 7-1 last season, will be the 
opening-day pitcher when Fullerton takes on Chapman today at 2:30 at Titan 
Field. Word came last week that the shoulder trouble that caused Beck to 
withdraw from competition for the U.S. Olympic team also would force him to 
undergo surgery and sit out this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was news that threw some uncertainty into the Titans' prospects. When both 
college baseball polls ranked Fullerton in the preseason top 10, it was done 
partly in recognition of the Titans' play in the College World Series last 
season and partly in anticipation of this season's team, which was to be led by 
Beck. 
</P>
<P>
For Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell, now in his second season, one question has 
replaced another. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being asked whether he can replace former coach Augie Garrido, now 
he's being asked if someone can replace Beck. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Fullerton went 43-18 and finished third in the College World Series 
last season and Cochell was named the national coach of the year, the Garrido 
question seemed sufficiently answered. Now this one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to lose a player of his caliber," Cochell said. "But we feel 
confident someone else can step in." 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said he still thinks the pitching staff is his team's strength. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans knew they had lost one starting pitcher in Longo Garcia, whose 
eligibility expired. With the loss of Beck, who struck out a team-record 162 
last season, they turn to DeVille, a consistent senior who had a 3.27 
earned-run average last year. Huck Flener, a left-hander who was 4-1 with a 
3.86 ERA last season as a freshman, is the second starter. With Beck out, Paul 
Johnson, a right-hander who worked as a reliever last season, becomes a 
starter. Sophomore Matt Watson and Sam Colarusso, a transfer from Orange Coast 
College, could break into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Robinson, Rich Faulks and freshman James Popoff are the long and middle 
relievers, with Erik Silvey and Golden West College transfer Kenneth Hokuf the 
short relievers. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel good about our pitching staff," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Handling that staff is Mayne, the steady hand who put together a school- and 
conference-record 38-game hitting streak last season while batting .393. His 
defense is as steady as his hitting, and with the addition of 20 pounds, he 
should be the backbone of this team. Freshman Eddie Lample will be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing 35 home runs with the departure of first baseman Keith Kaub and 
second basemen Mike Ross, the Titans will be a good offensive team. 
</P>
<P>
David Staton, a first baseman/designated hitter who transferred from Orange 
Coast College, will try to replace some of that power. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel good about Staton," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said a sore back muscle will keep Staton out of the lineup for the 
first week. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Peters, a senior whom Cochell calls "probably the best defensive first 
baseman he has coached," will play first base and outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ramirez returns at third base, with Saddleback College transfer Bill 
Lasher competing for time. 
</P>
<P>
In Cochell's mind, the question about this team is its defense up the middle, 
where last year's double-play duo of Ross and Mark Razook is falling to the 
hands of a freshman and a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Mate Borgagno, a left-handed-hitting sophomore from Chino Hills who transferred 
from Nebraska, has laid claim to second base, and freshman Randy Graves from 
Riverside Poly High School is starting today at shortstop. Graves is in a 
battle with John Paboojian, a transfer from Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
In the outfield, Rich Gonzales, a transfer from Rancho Santiago whom Cochell 
calls "an outstanding hitter," will be in left, with returning player Bobby 
Jones in center. In right, left-hander Trevor Neighbors and Rod Klopfer from 
Fullerton are likely to platoon. Paul Bunch from Cypress College also will play 
in right. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to get going," Cochell said.

RANCHO SANTIAGO STILL CHALLENGING DESPITE ADVERSITY

<P>
Given the Rancho Santiago College basketball team's propensity toward injury or 
illness this season, one would figure the Dons to be at the bottom of the 
Orange Empire Conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
But with determination and a few bandages, the players have been able to hang 
together to remain only a game behind conference-leading Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (15-8 overall, 5-2 in conference), with 4 consecutive 
victories, plays host to Cypress Wednesday while Saddleback is at Riverside. 
The Dons travel to Riverside Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Troubles began for Rancho Santiago with the start of the season, when freshman 
center Corie Blount suffered an ankle injury and decided to redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the time conference play began in early January, forward Mike Hunter 
came down with the flu and missed a game. Starting center Matt Lien and reserve 
guard Tommy Villanueva were also slowed by the flu the past 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Tony Smalley missed 2 games with a groin injury. Smalley, a sophomore 
forward, has played in a reserve role in the last 2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Another starter, freshman guard Craig Rice, hurt his ankle and has missed the 
last 2 games. And sophomore guard Chris Martin injured his wrist during 
practice, but is playing with it wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone asked me if we would be better once everyone was healthy," Rancho 
Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said. "If that happens, then I will have a problem 
of not knowing who to play. Actually, this might be better for us. We have so 
many players that are even that it really helped push the freshmen into 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
One of the freshmen who have emerged during this difficult time is guard Alvin 
Loftis, who scored a career-high 22 points as Rancho Santiago defeated 
Fullerton, 69-59, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of guys out," Loftis said. "It gave me my chance to start and 
things have worked out pretty well since then." 
</P>
<P>
Ready for spring sports? Well, wait no longer. The baseball season starts 
Friday. Cypress and Orange Coast, the early picks to contend for the Orange 
Empire Conference title, both begin play in the College of the Desert 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The teams shared the tournament title last season and OCC won it the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to get started," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "It will be nice 
to start playing games that mean something." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress opens with Chaffey at Angel Stadium in Palm Springs at 2:30 p.m., and 
OCC plays at host College of the Desert at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago, runner-up in the state to Sacramento City last season, opens 
Friday at San Diego Southwestern at 2 p.m. Saddleback is at Rio Hondo Friday at 
2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Fullerton plays host to Los Angeles Valley at noon, and Golden West 
is at San Diego Southwestern at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore point guard Elbert Davis of Golden West is leading the state with 8.6 
assists per game and already has set a Golden West career record with 411 
assists. Davis, from Santiago High School, set the Golden West single-season 
assist record with 195 last season and has 216 so far this season. Davis' 
teammate, sophomore Markus Muller-Stach of Corona del Mar High, has scored 
1,140 points in his career and is in third place on the Golden West all-time 
list. He needs 18 points to tie second-place Truiett Hatton (1978-79 and 
1981-82). Chris Thompson (1969-71) heads the list with 1,441 points. . . . Ian 
Donnelly, a freshman forward at Cypress, injured his knee last week and no time 
is set for his return. Donnelly, who started 7 games, averaged 7.7 points and 
4.2 rebounds. He was 38 of 40 from the free-throw line. . . . With 5 games 
remaining, Mike Varos has tied the Cypress single season and career records 
with 56 3-pointers. Varos has equaled the mark set by Andy Olivarez, now 
playing at USC, during the 1986-87 season. . . . Visiting teams continue to 
hold the advantage in Orange Empire Conference men's basketball games. The 
visitors are 14-10 through the first 24 games.

ALMANAC / COUNTY RETAIL SALES IN SECOND QUARTER: BEACH CITY JUMPS INTO 4TH 
PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach rose to fourth place from sixth among county cities in retail 
sales for the 1988 second quarter, compared to the first quarter, according to 
the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
The beach city moved past Irvine and Orange in the ranking. Huntington Beach 
had second-quarter sales of $382.5 million, a 4.7% increase compared to 1988 
first-quarter sales of $365.4 million. Sales in Irvine fell 8.2% to $379.5 
million from $413.2 million, and sales in Orange rose 2.3% to $379.4 million 
from $370.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The top three cities -- Anaheim, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa -- were unchanged 
from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the county totaled $5.9 billion in the second quarter, a 7.1% increase 
from 1987's second quarter. That increase topped the 5% statewide rise, and the 
county also recorded stronger sales growth than Los Angeles and San Diego

Officials of a Japanese health services company last week visited the St. 
Joseph &amp; St. Jude Home Health Network in Orange to gather information that 
will help them establish Japan's first home health-care service. Sherry 
Carmack, administrator of the St. Joseph &amp; St. Jude Home Health Network, 
said she met last Thursday with top officials of the newly formed home health 
division of Duskin Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. Carmack said Service Master Home 
Health, a Chicago-based management firm that operates the home health care 
service for St. Joseph and St. Jude hospitals in Orange County, is assisting 
Duskin in setting up a pilot home nursing program in Tokyo. Carmack said 
Duskin's home health service will be a first for Japan and is scheduled to 
begin operation in March.

MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin said it has secured key financing commitments for 
its proposed hostile takeover of Prime Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has committed to provide up to $325 million

completed. Toronto-based Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has committed to 
provide an additional $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the financing is supposed to come from high-yield junk bonds 
arranged by Drexel Burnham Lambert, but MAI is still negotiating a final 
agreement with the investment banking firm. MAI is trying to acquire Prime, a 
leading maker of minicomputers, for $970 million.

A SINGULAR 'KING LEAR' REIGNS AT UCI AS A RADICAL REVELATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a bombed-out set suggesting the bleak terrain of war, Robert Cohen's 
"radically reconceived" version of "King Lear" at UC Irvine begins with a 
perverse smile. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as though a Gilbert and Sullivan farce has taken up residence at 
Lear's palace amid rusted carcasses of machinery and automobile parts, which 
are embedded like shrapnel in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting the king's arrival, the dashing young Kent and the white-bearded 
Gloucester have the look of gaudy toy soldiers. They wear resplendent 
quasi-Victorian uniforms of maroon and gold braid with epaulets and sashes. 
</P>
<P>
And while the two of them make cocktail party small talk about affairs of state 
and family, Gloucester's bastard son, Edmund, obsequiously bends to polish one 
of dear pater's boots. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwall and Albany enter in white tie and tails -- their ribbons indicating 
diplomatic rank -- accompanied by three prom queens in strapless gowns and 
bustles. These are Lear's daughters: Goneril in brown, Regan in green and 
Cordelia in blue. It is, to say the least, peculiar. 
</P>
<P>
More peculiar still, a praetorian guard of modern infantry commandos fills the 
stage when Lear arrives. The assembled members of the court greet him with 
deferential applause. The applause grows into an ovation. The ovation breaks 
into rhythmic clapping. It is fervent, aggressive, insistent, prolonged. Are we 
suddenly in "Evita?" 
</P>
<P>
The object of this veneration looks like Super General himself, a sort of Sun 
King with a gray goatee in hybrid military get-up. Tall and austere, Lear wears 
a crown on his head and a regal bronze collar worthy of the Pharaohs. But he is 
old. He is tired of governing. He wants to be loved, really loved. 
</P>
<P>
The arch setup turns out to be a shrewd piece of theater. It both mocks and 
underscores the stifling unreality of Lear's court. The applause is an 
especially nice touch, tipping us not only to the sycophancy that surrounds 
Lear but to his egomania. 
</P>
<P>
The brittle inner logic of the scene also makes plausible Lear's division of 
the kingdom, which is usually a tough sell. We cluck our tongues yet understand 
when Lear gives half the realm to Goneril and half to Regan for their flattery 
and zip to Cordelia for her honesty. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being the "radical reconception" that Cohen has termed it, however, 
this "King Lear" appears to be a radical revelation. It goes in for essentials. 
Despite varied and highly theatrical unorthodoxies, the classic arc of Lear 
laid low by his own arrogance is traced with singular intensity. It clarifies. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the production sometimes lapses into radical reduction. It mugs. It 
has a tendency to impose simplistic illustrations, to become a "Lear" primer. 
But it assiduously avoids murkiness, the great pitfall of many a Shakespeare 
production. It also moves swiftly, despite an epic length of 3 hours and 15 
minutes. It works. 
</P>
<P>
The student cast handles the Elizabethan language with striking fluency. The 
line readings are remarkable for their conversational flow (even if they come 
trippingly off some tongues at a shrill pitch). More striking is how 
effectively the text is plumbed for meaning. The director has done a brilliant 
job integrating it with the action, focusing the stage business. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, we feel the primacy of the relationship between Lear and his Fool. 
We need not deduce it. We see it in the warmth of their intimacy. When the Fool 
cleverly plucks Lear's beard and hair and tells him with typical irony, "Thou 
shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise," Lear might be looking in 
a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The Fool is the only one at ease with Lear. That has the effect of exalting 
their relationship. And the charm of their scenes together seems to rub off on 
UCI drama professor Dudley Knight, who plays Lear. At the premiere Thursday, he 
generally achieved a dry, competent portrayal. Opposite Larry Biederman's 
richly played Fool, he gained depth, range and subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
With less success, the production also fleshes out the characters of Lear's two 
scheming daughters, Regan (Michelle McHugh) and Goneril (Pamela Livingstone) -- 
going well beyond the usual depictions into the realm of "Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Regan, once out of her prom gown, vamps around in skin-tight pants and 
knee-high boots like an evil-minded Jessica. Always on the prowl for some 
useful seduction, at one point she trots out in a black garter belt and 
stockings (unintentionally drawing laughs on opening night). 
</P>
<P>
Goneril, less conspicuously curvy, is no less a schemer. She dispatches sly 
letters about mad old dad and his nasty retinue. A royal matron, she stalks the 
palace halls in the basic royal house dress -- a fur coat (presumably mink) -- 
on the lookout for bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Cordelia eludes characterization altogether. Shakespeare didn't write a great 
role there, and Luck Hari doesn't bring much to it besides blandness. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jonathan S. Greenman is thoroughly persuasive as the duplicitous 
Edmund, standing up for bastards with sharp contempt. And Mark Booher gives a 
consistently fine performance as Kent. 
</P>
<P>
UCI visiting lecturer Ray Reinhard unwinds as Gloucester by the second act. 
Still, Gloucester's relationship with Edgar (Philip Thompson) never attains the 
pathos it should. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting and set design work well. The incidental music is attractive 
(though sometimes too obviously exploited), and the sound design technically 
sophisticated.

CANNED HEAT RETURNS WITH SMOKY BLUES; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. HIPPIE BAND STRESSES ROOTS, NOT COUNTERCULTURAL EXCESS, IN LIVELY SET AT 
FULLERTON'S GOODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In terms of potential hideousness, the imagined prospect of a 1989 Canned Heat 
show would have to rank high. Even in its late '60s heyday, the L.A.-based band 
offered a not-always-palatable mash of blues purism (both original front men 
Bob (the Bear) Hite and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson were regarded experts on blues 
lore) and counterculture excess, with Hite's lyrics positing hippies as the new 
oppressed race and the band's boogie rhythms fuzzed up through 200-watt amps 
larger than some blues men's homes. 
</P>
<P>
That combination appealed enough at the time -- the group was a hit at both the 
Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock -- but here in the age of rank oldies 
cash-ins, and featuring only the original bass player and nearly original 
drummer (Wilson died in 1970, Hite in 1981, and guitarist Henry (Sunflower) 
Vestine is long gone from the band), Canned Heat's show at Goodies in Fullerton 
Sunday night seemed more likely to live up to the band's first name than its 
second. 
</P>
<P>
But, while the new Canned Heat made its obligatory nods to the past -- even 
whipping out a wood flute for "Going Up the Country" -- there wasn't a whiff of 
patchouli in the smoky blues pouring from the quartet. The 10-song set seemed 
more intent on keeping the blues alive today than in exhuming its past. 
</P>
<P>
The group has a very capable, if not entirely captivating, front man in 
singer/harmonica player/slide guitarist James Thornberry. In snaring Orange 
County's Junior Watson (late of the Mighty Flyers) last year, the band may have 
gained the best blues guitarist now working in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Thornberry claimed even such Hite staples as "Let's Work Together" as his own 
with a thick, grainy voice, and his harmonica playing achieved a furious 
intensity on an extended boogie number. On occasion, though, his playing veered 
toward accuracy rather than passion. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's playing nearly always hit an emotional mark -- and hammered it 
steadily on the showcase instrumental, "Hucklebuck" -- but it generally arrived 
there by thoroughly devious means: Instead of going for obvious killer lines, 
Watson consistently achieved a tension by taking unexpected byways, using a 
delightfully skewed logic to sift through a musical vocabulary encompassing 
delta blues, be-bop and the wild-hair country-jazz keenings of Jimmy Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the long boogie number, the band's standards were solidly 
delivered, with drummer Fito de la Parra taking over Wilson's reedy falsetto in 
"On the Road Again" and "Goin' Up the Country." Requisite bass and drum solos 
were delivered with dispatch, though both de la Parra and bassist Larry Taylor 
(who has provided a foundation for everyone from the Monkees to Tom Waits) 
seemed happier laying down a solid bottom through the set. 
</P>
<P>
The five songs taken from its new album, "Reheated" (available only as a German 
import), suggested that the band could easily forgo its catalogue numbers if it 
chose. Both a stewing version of "Mercury Blues" and the T-Birdish encore of 
New Orleans pianist Ronnie Barron's "Looking for the Party" were as fresh as 
anything else on the current blues scene.

NORTH JURY SELECTION BOGS DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC FAMILIARITY WITH HIM POSES PROBLEM, JUDGE SAYS

Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial quickly ran into jury selection trouble 
today and the judge said there could be problems with "triability of the case" 
because so many people had seen or read of North's testimony in congressional 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said only 16 of the first 54 prospective 
jurors indicated on questionnaires they had not been exposed to North's 
congressional appearances. The former White House aide testified to House and 
Senate investigating committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity from 
prosecution based on his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell decided to hear arguments on how much exposure to such testimony ought 
to be allowed before a possible juror is disqualified. He said he will rule 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As proceedings began, North, dressed in a dark suit, sat at the defense table. 
He had testified to Congress in his ribbon-bedecked Marine uniform but has 
since retired from the service. 
</P>
<P>
North's trial on charges of lying to Congress, shredding evidence and 
conspiring to commit tax fraud "arises following a period of fairly intense 
publicity on television, newspapers, magazines" which will continue, Gesell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly excused the first five prospective jurors after all said they had 
been exposed to North's 1987 testimony. 
</P>
<P>
One said she had had the television turned on and was aware of North's 
immunized testimony, in which he detailed activities in connection with which 
he is now accused of crimes. Another prospective juror said she had monitored 
North's congressional appearances "rather continuously." Two others agreed with 
the judge's characterization that they had been "interested" in North's 
testimony. A fifth said she may have seen portions of North's congressional 
appearances "once or twice a week" during the time he testified. 
</P>
<P>
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, also sought to rule out as jurors anyone 
who in recent days had seen North's congressional testimony replayed in news 
reports as the trial start neared. 
</P>
<P>
John Keker, who heads the prosecution team for independent counsel Lawrence 
Walsh, said he wanted to present arguments on the process of automatically 
disqualifying prospective jurors because they thought they might have been 
exposed to North's testimony.

Xerox Corp. today announced a restructuring plan that will eliminate 2,000 
positions -- including some in Los Angeles -- and set up a new worldwide 
marketing and sales organization to increase profits and become more 
market-driven. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making fundamental changes in the way we do business," Xerox President 
Paul A. Allaire said. Under the restructuring, the company will combine the 
management of all Xerox sales operations worldwide and form a new marketing and 
customer operations organization. The company reported that because of the 
restructuring, its fourth-quarter 1988 net was a loss of $77 million, or a loss 
of 83 cents per share, compared to net income of $155 million, or $1.43 per 
share, a year earlier.

An Air Force tanker plane with 19 people aboard crashed on takeoff today from 
Dyess Air Force Base, exploding in what witnesses called a ball of flames. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said she had no word on whether any of the 
19 aboard survived the crash but witnesses told Cable News Network it was 
unlikely anyone could have lived through the crash and explosion. The KC-135 
aircraft, laden with fuel, had taken off in mild weather on a flight to Hickam 
Air Force Base in Hawaii.

A gunman who barricaded himself inside a house in Malibu after he threatened to 
kill his mother and sister was found dead from an apparently self-inflicted 
gunshot when the Sheriff's Department SWAT team entered the house about 12:30 
this afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The women escaped safely from the house and warned deputies that there had been 
a family argument and that the man had a rifle. One of them had summoned the 
lawmen by telephone about 8:06 a.m. Deputies heard a gunshot while they talked 
with the man by telephone, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. The identities of the 
people in the house in the 26900 block of Pacific Coast Highway were not 
immediately available.

GREENSPAN FORESEES NO RECESSION;

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said today the rise in interest 
rates over the last 10 months is unlikely to lead to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, by suppressing some of the forces that could have led to economic 
instability, the Fed's restrictive policy is more likely to extend the 
expansion than bring it to an early halt, Greenspan told the Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also said the U.S. trade deficit will continue to decline without any 
further devaluation of the dollar. He said that U.S. export orders remain high 
and that American industries are still "quite competitive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Oil Bill to Rise 
</P>
<P>
"I think the trade deficit will continue to decline later this year," he said, 
although he added that higher U.S. exports will be offset in part by an 
increase in the U.S. oil bill. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan reiterated that the risk of higher inflation is sufficiently great 
that monetary policy might well be advised to err more on the side of 
restrictiveness than of stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Joint Committee that current inflation rates are already clearly 
too high and must be brought down. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk of greater inflation could be appreciable if real GNP continued to 
increase at recent rates over the next several years," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the differences he currently has with President Bush are "close to 
negligible," adding that he has known Bush's economic views for years and fully 
concurred with the President's statement last week that there is very little 
difference between them. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Bush and Greenspan sparred over monetary policy.

General Motors Corp. said today that it has reached a preliminary agreement to 
pay about 10,000 black salaried employees about $3 million to end a five-year 
class-action suit charging the auto maker with an unfair pay structure. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said the agreement covers current and former 
black salaried employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana who claimed that they 
were denied pay raises and promotions. Former employees covered are those who 
worked for the auto maker between 1982 and 1986. GM estimated the cost of the 
preliminary settlement at $3 million, but the leading counsel for the 
plaintiffs said it could swell to as much as $40 million.

ALASKA'S COLD BLASTS INTO NORTHERN TIER STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temperatures plunged from 62 above to 10 below zero in less than a day when the 
record cold air from Alaska swept into the northern tier of the Western states 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Wind chills to 50 below zero and blowing snow were reported in parts of Montana 
and North Dakota as a massive high-pressure system responsible for the 16-day 
Alaskan cold wave began to spill into the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get pasted," said Gary Addington, 35, of Portland, Ore., where 
rain was expected to turn to snow as the cold front moved down into the Pacific 
Northwest tonight. 
</P>
<P>
After a record high of 62 Monday, the temperature in Great Falls, Mont., 
plunged to 10 below zero this morning and a winter storm watch was issued. 
</P>
<P>
Wind chills plunged to 50 below in North Dakota and were expected to drop as 
low as 65 below zero tonight. Snow combined with winds gusting to 40 m.p.h. 
reduced visibilities to an eighth of a mile at Grand Forks, N.D., closing U.S. 
2 between Grand Forks and Thief River Falls, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schools Closed 
</P>
<P>
At least 24 schools across North Dakota were closed today as blowing snow cut 
visibility to near zero, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The arctic chill closed schools, froze water pipes and cut off villages in 
Alaska. As it descends southward, temperatures were expected to plunge in the 
next few days to 30 below in Rapid City, S.D., which set a record high of 72 
Monday and where the spring-like weather had brought pesky box elder bugs out 
of dormancy and onto tree limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Agronomists warned that the cold wave could destroy the winter wheat crop, 
which is already endangered because of the drought that was felt most keenly 
last summer and is still afflicting much of the nation's Farm Belt. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching cold front was producing wind gusts of nearly 60 m.p.h. at 
Cody, Wyo., and the high winds were expected to spread across the foothills of 
the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Gusts up to 124 m.p.h. near Choteau, Mont., overnight overturned 10 empty cars 
of a freight train, and tracks were briefly blocked by a toppled grain 
elevator. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, the cold wave was expected to bring below-freezing temperatures as 
far east as Ohio, where temperatures up to the 60s -- about 25 degrees above 
normal -- have made it feel like early spring.

All lanes of the San Diego Freeway southbound shut down this morning after a 
tractor-trailer and car collided in Seal Beach, setting a car afire. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Bill Jacques said a Camaro sideswiped the 
rear of the tractor-trailer as it entered the southbound San Diego Freeway from 
the San Gabriel River Freeway at 5:45 a.m. The 65-foot truck swerved across 
three lanes and collided with a Corvette, which was crushed beneath its front 
end. The Corvette driver escaped the fire but suffered a six-inch gash on his 
head that required 30 stitches.

Auditors from the three federal agencies in charge of regulating U.S. banks are 
teaming up for a special review of loans used to finance corporate buyouts, an 
Administration official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clarke, the comptroller of the currency, told a congressional panel that 
the review would apply to loans of $20 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Comptroller would join with the Federal Reserve Board and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under the Shared National Credit Program, which 
assesses large loans shared by two or more banks. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of three days of hearings on how to control the recent trend 
of leveraged buyouts, Administration officials continued to urge caution in 
adopting any new regulatory measures. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Congress should move carefully to 
restrict buyouts.

Japanese auto makers have projected substantial sales growth in the domestic 
car market in 1989 but expect a modest rise or even a decline in their export 
plans, largely because of the appreciation of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic passenger car sales, including imported cars, hit a record 3.7 million 
units in 1988, and some industry executives have predicted that the volume this 
year is expected to top 5 million units. 
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 3.2% to 6.1 million units, mainly because of sluggish sales to 
North America, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest market for Japanese auto makers, taking nearly 
one third of their global sales. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's top auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp., has projected a 2% decline in its 
exports in 1989, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. forecast 
declines of 2.4% and 1.2% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor Co., said, "There is concern about the 
impact of the continued strong yen on exports. The situation for vehicle 
exports is expected to remain severe overall."

State gaming officials moved today to bar Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from 
doing business with New Jersey's casino industry because of the firm's 
involvement in a major Wall Street corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, 
issued a statement saying the division filed a complaint with the Casino 
Control Commission seeking suspension of the investment company's casino 
business dealings, a lucrative source of business for Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Parrillo said the gaming division wants Drexel's business stopped until a 
federal fraud investigation surrounding the firm is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has earned fees totaling more than $120 million by marketing securities 
valued at more than $3 billion for the Atlantic City casinos, said Parrillo, 
whose division is the investigative arm of the state attorney general's office.

XEROX LOSES $77 MILLION FOR QUARTER, CITES STREAMLINING

<P>
Xerox Corp. today said it lost $77 million in the fourth quarter, the result of 
a streamlining program in which it will cut 2,000 jobs, trim its typewriter 
business and stop selling medical image-making equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox, the copier giant based in Stamford, Conn., said that without the pretax 
charge of $275 million, its profit in the quarter would have risen 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The company lost money last year in electronic typewriters; document work 
stations; and medical image-making, which uses an unusual copying process 
called xeroradiography, according to David Kearns, Xerox's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not moving as rapidly toward our objectives as we feel we must," Kearns 
said in a news conference, explaining the streamlining program. 
</P>
<P>
The losses were partially offset by a good reception for its new 50 Series of 
copiers and healthy profits in the financial services business, which accounts 
for 30% of Xerox revenue, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox said its loss in the fourth quarter contrasted with a profit of $155 
million, or $1.43 a share, a year earlier. Without the charge, it said, profit 
would have been $167 million. Revenue rose 6% to $4.4 billion from $4.15 
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, Xerox said its earnings fell 33% to $388 million, or $3.50 a 
share, from $578 million, or $5.35 a share, a year earlier. Without the 
fourth-quarter charge, profit would have risen 9% to $632 million. Revenue rose 
9% to $16.4 billion from $15.1 billion.

<P>
The NBA has fined Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons and Brad Daugherty of 
the Cleveland Cavaliers $5,000 each for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged blows during Cleveland's 80-79 victory last week over 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Both players missed games Sunday after receiving one-game suspensions without 
pay. The suspension cost Daugherty $10,900, Laimbeer $7,300. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland general manager Wayne Embry also was fined $1,000 for leaving his 
seat behind the Cavaliers' bench and charging the court during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer has said he won't appeal the fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best thing for me would be not to talk about the incident 
anymore," he said. "I should just get ready to start playing basketball and 
keep my mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong to take a swing, at him, but to put me in the same boat as 
Laimbeer is ludicrous," he said.

Former University of Houston football coach Bill Yeoman, who coached the 
Cougars to national prominence during his 25 years as coach, is expected to 
retire soon from his university fund-raising position, the Houston Chronicle 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman has served in the fund-raising post since he retired from football 
coaching in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman, 61, retired with one of college football's winningest records at 
160-108-8. The record was remarkable in that in his last five seasons, UH teams 
won only 22 of 56 games. 
</P>
<P>
The West Point graduate and former player invented the Veer offense, a dominant 
college offense in the 1970s and early '80s. The Veer still is used widely in 
high school football. 
</P>
<P>
In 25 years, Yeoman's teams went to 12 bowl games, including three Cotton Bowls 
in UH's first four years in the Southwest Conference in the late 1970s. His 
1984 team returned to the Cotton Bowl.
