FEDERAL PANEL FAVORS EARLY USE OF AIDS DRUG 
</P>

<P>
A federal advisory panel on Tuesday recommended expanding the approved uses of 
the antiviral drug AZT to include AIDS patients in the early stages of the 
disease as well as those who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not yet 
developed outward symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the latter group, the panel said, the drug should be 
administered only to infected patients whose level of critical T4 cells has 
dropped below 500 per cubic millimeter of blood, providing evidence of damage 
to their immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
The normal range for T4 cells, the primary targets of the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is 800 to 1,200 per cubic millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration's antiviral 
drugs advisory committee are not binding on the agency, but it traditionally 
wields considerable influence in FDA decision-making. The agency is expected to 
go along with the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, also known as zidovudene, currently is approved only for patients with 
fully developed AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we intervene early . . . we are not going to accomplish the true 
therapeutic goals for this disease," said Dr. Richard J. Whitley, a consultant 
to the panel and chairman of the independent scientific board monitoring the 
AZT studies. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hold out a decision . . . we potentially could be doing a disservice to 
individuals" who could benefit from the early administration of AZT, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel raised some concerns about the potential for HIV to develop a 
resistance to the drug, a phenomenon already seen in patients with fully 
developed AIDS. In addition, recently released results of animal studies have 
shown that AZT can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these reservations, the panel agreed that the potential benefits of 
taking the drug at an earlier stage appear to far outweigh the risks. But they 
called for additional research to evaluate the long-term effects of the drug, 
which are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if the effectiveness of AZT in the earlier stages of disease has 
been demonstrated," said Dr. Alvin Novick, a professor of biology at Yale 
University and a member of the panel. "It is important to recognize this 
officially to inform physicians and patients across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the concerns about developing a resistant virus, Novick said he 
thought it "unthinkable to withhold therapy from today's patients out of fear 
that we will be reducing the effectiveness of therapy 10 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that I'm not respectful of patients 10 years from now -- they're just as 
precious -- but I believe we'll have alternative therapies for them that we 
don't have for the current patients of today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action was unusual because it was taken before studies on 
affected patients have been published in a medical journal. However, the 
results of the studies of AZT on two patient groups were so compelling that the 
studies were stopped for most of the participants so that those in the 
comparison groups, which had been taking a medically worthless placebo, could 
instead receive AZT. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the FDA has been under increased pressure in recent months to 
formally expand the drug's approved uses for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, if enacted by the FDA, almost certainly will be welcomed by many 
physicians and AIDS advocacy groups, who have been pushing for such a change 
since the studies were announced with considerable fanfare last summer by 
federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although physicians are free to prescribe a drug any way they see fit once it 
has been approved for marketing, many have been reluctant to administer AZT for 
unapproved uses before the study data is available. In addition, many insurers 
will not pay for the drug unless it is prescribed for a use approved by the 
FDA. 
</P>
<P>
In the months following announcement of the study results, many AIDS activists 
charged that thousands of patients around the country were being hurt, either 
because their doctors were giving them too much AZT, or in the case of infected 
patients without symptoms, no AZT at all. 
</P>
<P>
Offering the first real evidence that AZT benefits patients with the beginning 
symptoms of infection, health officials announced last Aug. 3 that a study 
showed AZT "significantly" slows the progression of disease in patients with 
early AIDS-related complex, a finding they estimated could benefit 95,000 to 
200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the government announced that the drug had been shown to delay 
the onset of the disease in infected individuals with T4-cell counts of less 
than 500. The study also tested AZT on infected individuals with more than 500 
T4 cells, but the information was inconclusive and the research on that group 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The studies also showed that AZT was tolerated better by patients who received 
it early. Many individuals with fully developed AIDS have experienced toxic 
side effects from AZT. 
</P>
<P>
If the FDA follows the panel recommendations, the decision could have an impact 
on about 600,000 of the estimated 1 million or more infected individuals in 
this country, federal health officials said.

SURPLUS FOOD CUTS STARVE LUNCH PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Dwindling stockpiles of surplus food are creating severe shortages in school 
food programs throughout the country, causing school districts to raise prices 
and students to drop out of lunch programs in large numbers, educators and 
government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
While schools are being pressured to improve student nutrition, many are losing 
large chunks of their cafeteria budgets because federal surpluses of cheese, 
powdered milk, beef and other commodities have dried up. 
</P>
<P>
After relying on government surpluses for nearly a decade, districts throughout 
the country are having to buy food that had formerly been free -- at the same 
time that food prices are skyrocketing because of shortages caused by the 
Christmas freeze in Florida and Texas, the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake 
and the lingering effects of the 1988 drought. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the loss of so-called "bonus commodities" from the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture is bringing many school food programs close to disaster. The 
problem is a dramatic example of competing needs -- the budget deficit versus 
the nation's schoolchildren -- and shows in tangible terms how agricultural 
policy directly affects the food on cafeteria trays. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools around the country are having to cope with these massive shortfalls," 
said Kevin Dando, spokesman for the American School Food Service Assn. "This is 
the school year when it's really been a major trauma. The term I keep hearing 
about this is 'the silent erosion of the school lunch program.' " 
</P>
<P>
The loss of bonus commodities could be even more serious for schools if budget 
cuts proposed by President Bush on Monday are enacted. Under the proposed 
budget, the school lunch program will be cut by $180 million in 1991 by making 
it more difficult for families to qualify for free school lunches for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"We're worried about low-income kids not having access to any lunch at all," 
said Edward Cooney, deputy director of the Food and Research Action Center. 
"We're concerned that the health and nutritional status of low-income children 
will be at risk because of the absence of commodities, coupled with the cuts in 
budgets." 
</P>
<P>
School districts in San Diego County have either raised prices of their lunch 
programs or engaged in deficit spending to cope with increased costs in the 
food service. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District experienced a 17% decrease in the number 
of full-paid lunches at elementary schools after lunch prices went from 80 
cents to $1 at the beginning of the 1989-90 school year, Jane Boehrer, director 
of the student nutrition program, said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices at the junior and high school levels also increased, from $1.25 to 
$1.50, Boehrer said, although she could not say how many students dropped from 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, there is a 1% loss of students taking the meal for every per cent 
increase in the price," Boehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway Unified School District has drawn on reserves to make up for 
increased food prices, but those will only last a short time, said Joan 
Kleinhans, director of the district's nutrition program. "It's a definite 
possibility" that next school year Poway will increase its prices, which stand 
at $1 at elementary schools and $1.25 at junior and high schools, Kleinhans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the nutrition program at Grossmont Unified High School 
District rose as much as 20% this year, according to Jo Ruth Wright, director 
of student nutrition. The price of lunch at Grossmont, which serves 720 lunches 
a day, jumped from $1.50 to $1.75 in September. 
</P>
<P>
The Sweetwater Unified High School District responded to a 7% increase cost of 
foods, combined with salary raises, by raising lunch prices from $1.25 to $1.40 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
After losing more than $7 million in federal food subsidies, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District raised its lunch prices from 50 cents to 75 cents for 
elementary school children and from $1.25 to $1.50 for secondary students. As a 
result, the district says, 1.4 million fewer lunches will be sold at school 
this year, a drop of 13% over the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
For some students, that means no lunch at all, said Stephen Garcia, director of 
the school district's food services branch. For others, "rather than have a 
nutritious meal, they'll buy junk food at the local 7-Eleven or some carbonated 
drink and candy at one of our student stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical meal purchased at a Los Angeles school could include the following: 
burrito or empanada, taco sauce, fresh fruit, apple-oatmeal cookie and milk. It 
is a far cry from a candy and a Coke, and it supplies about one-third of a 
child's recommended daily nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946 to provide such lunches 
"as a measure of national security," after one-third of all draftees rejected 
for service in World War II were found to be physically unfit because of 
nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Billion Cut 
</P>
<P>
The program's most recent problems began with the 1981 Omnibus Reconciliation 
Act, the Reagan Administration's attempt to cut the national budget by $35 
billion and deal with the deficit. As part of the law, the Administration cut 
$1 billion from the school lunch program, said Edward Cooney, deputy director 
of the Food and Research Action Center. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, school districts were promised by the Agriculture Department 
that the cuts would be mitigated with a free flow of government surplus food, 
Cooney said. The foodstuffs were called "bonus commodities," because they were 
given to schools in addition to food and monetary support mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus commodities helped the schools during a difficult time. They also 
helped the federal government, which had stockpiled several billion dollars in 
surplus dairy products in an effort to stabilize the dairy industry. 
</P>
<P>
The surpluses came about because of a policy that turned the federal government 
into the market of last resort for the nation's dairy farmers. If dairy herds 
over-produced and farmers could not sell the surplus, the government bought it. 
By the early 1980s, buying the surplus products was costing the government too 
much money, and storing it added to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus commodity program solved the problem. Its attraction to schools was 
that they could get as many bonus commodities as they could use without waste. 
One of the major items given out was cheese, of which there was so much surplus 
that the government kept it in caves near Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1988 the surpluses began to dwindle, Cooney said, even though the school 
lunch funding cut in 1981 was not replaced. One reason for the drop in 
surpluses, in addition to food-giveaway programs, was the Dairy Termination Act 
of 1985, which paid dairy farmers to go out of business in an effort to cut 
overproduction. Approximately 1.5 million cows were slaughtered through the 
dairy buyout. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986-1987 school year, cafeterias received $442 million in bonus 
commodities from the USDA, said Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the agency. 
In the current fiscal year, that assistance has shrunk to about $125 million; 
about $100 million of that surplus food is butter. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I'm being offered in bonus commodities is butter, and I have 
plenty of butter," said Mary Klatko, director of food and nutrition services 
for Howard County Public Schools in Ellicott City, Md. "We still had cheese all 
of last year in the state of Maryland, right through June. We came back in 
September to no cheese." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the school district is buying cheese and other commodities on the 
open market. Between August and December, 1989, Klatko saw her food prices rise 
18%, largely because of the drought and other natural disasters. Pizza, a 
cafeteria favorite, was hardest hit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paying 17.5 cents per slice (of pizza) last year because of the bonus 
cheese," Klatko said. "I'm now paying 35 cents. . . . I used to offer it every 
day in the elementary schools as an alternate. Now it's the highest priced item 
we have on the menu. I had to cut it to three days a week." 
</P>
<P>
School cafeterias have traditionally been self-sufficient, but the Memphis city 
schools' food service branch will have to borrow from the city's Board of 
Education for the first time next year, to make up for an anticipated loss of 
$1.5 million in surplus food from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in school food service for 20 years, and this is the first year I 
can remember this kind of impact on our program," said Shirley Watkins, 
director of food and nutrition services for the Memphis city schools. "The real 
trauma for all of us is that we do not see any light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) announced that the Senate Committee 
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry will hold hearings on bonus commodities 
and other nutrition issues in late February.

EX-DESPOTS CAN'T BANK ON THE SWISS; 
</P>
<P>
THE WORLD'S DICTATORS ARE BEING PUT ON NOTICE -- IF YOU'RE OUSTED, DON'T EXPECT 
YOUR NEST EGG TO BE WAITING IN ZURICH OR BASEL.

<P>
Swiss bankers and government officials say they have a warning for dictators 
and tyrants the world round: 
</P>
<P>
Your money is no longer safe in the famous private bank vaults of Switzerland, 
they say. The rules have changed. If a revolution comes to your country and you 
are rudely tossed from power, don't count on your nest egg to be waiting for 
you in the banks of Zurich or Basel or Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are the dishonest leader of a country," said federal banking regulator 
Daniel Zuberbuhler in an interview here in the Swiss capital, "you better not 
put your money here in Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the provisional government of Romania formally requested Swiss 
authorities to freeze any assets of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu held in 
Swiss banks. In fact, the Swiss government had already taken the preliminary 
step of ordering banks to freeze any Ceausescu assets on Dec. 22 after a 
Romanian exile claimed that the dictator and his family had hidden $400 million 
here. 
</P>
<P>
But the request Monday made it official, placing Romania in line behind the 
Philippines, Haiti, Panama and Paraguay in seeking assets of their former 
rulers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ceausescu case is the fifth since 1986 in which the Swiss government has 
acted to freeze assets of former national political leaders at the request of a 
new government that replaced them. 
</P>
<P>
This new willingness by Swiss officials and bankers to intervene in the banking 
affairs of former political leaders represents a radical break in a long-held 
tradition of strict banking secrecy and political neutrality in this country. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where tradition counts for practically everything, it is a 
revolutionary development akin to filling in the holes in Gruyere cheese or 
making chocolate bars from artificial chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Cases are also pending here against the families of the late Philippine leader 
Ferdinand E. Marcos; former Haitian leader Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier; 
former Paraguayan strongman Alfredo Stroessner and Panama's dictator, Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Legal action is also rumored to be under consideration against deposed 
Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov and the still-ruling leader of Zaire, Mobutu 
Sese Seko, whose Swiss holdings are said to be even larger than those of 
Marcos. Indeed, by some accounts, Mobutu may be the richest man in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem now that if some bank has Mr. Mobutu's money, they should get 
rid of it as soon as possible," said Zuberbuhler, a federal attorney who is 
deputy director of the Swiss Bank Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, it seems clear, is no longer a guaranteed safe deposit box for the 
money stolen by corrupt leaders from Tehran to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while the list of countries that have traditionally acted as tax 
havens, laundries and depositories of dirty money remains long, there are fewer 
places for a cash-embarrassed dictator to stash loot securely, observers of the 
international banking scene say. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. invasion of Panama in December makes that country less inviting, 
although its new leaders say existing bank privacy laws do not need reform but 
only enforcement to restore their teeth. Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, too, are 
moving out of the business, the former so that its practices conform to those 
in the rest of the European Community, of which it is a member, and the latter 
to improve its image. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the offshore money havens that remain are in the Caribbean -- the 
Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles and the Turks and Caicos, for 
instance -- but the observers note that in many cases, these lack the 
facilities and communications, and above all the political security, that 
Switzerland offers. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers in Switzerland hail their country's change of attitude as an 
important step into the world of laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The Swiss people are no longer comfortable with a reputation for being a safe 
haven for crooks who are leaders of countries," said banking regulator 
Zuberbuhler. 
</P>
<P>
"We should liberate Switzerland from dirty money. We don't need it," commented 
Zurich-based lawyer Moritz Leuenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Leuenberger represents the governments of the Philippines and Romania in 
lawsuits to retrieve money that they contend was stolen by their former 
leaders. As a member of the Swiss Parliament, he led an investigation into 
banking procedures that resulted in two proposed new laws governing banks, 
including one that would make it a criminal offense for a banker to mask the 
identity of a client. 
</P>
<P>
The practice had been common. During the Marcos proceedings, for example, it 
was discovered that the Philippine leader and his wife, Imelda, had 
communicated with a Swiss bank using the aliases "Mr. Saunders" and "Mrs. Ryan" 
and practiced false signatures to provide access to their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, scheduled for consideration by the Swiss Parliament this spring, 
would require the bank to seek and record the true identity of the clients 
depositing or withdrawing money. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers, while grudgingly going along with the program, worry that it will 
scare off other potential depositors, even those who are not corrupt leaders of 
Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The accumulation of these cases has resulted in a negative image," complained 
Ulrich Grete, executive vice president of Union de Banques Suisses in a recent 
interview in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Union de Banques Suisses is the largest banking company in Switzerland and one 
of the largest-volume banks in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
James Bond Villains 
</P>
<P>
"If there is corruption somewhere in the world, the talk always turns to Swiss 
banks. In every James Bond movie, every bad guy has an account in Switzerland. 
It is some kind of juicy detail that seems to be required." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Grete, most Swiss banks have been policing themselves for years. 
Robert Studer, president of Grete's bank, commented recently in an interview 
with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund: "We do not refuse the money of political 
leaders as a matter of principle. That would be extraordinarily unjust. But 
before we do business with a political leader, it first must be approved by a 
member of the executive board." 
</P>
<P>
Many Swiss bankers complain that there is too much subjectivity and hindsight 
involved in dealing with political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether somebody is a good guy or a bad guy can change overnight," said Grete. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, before their fall from power, Marcos, Noriega and Ceausescu were all at 
one time in favor with the United States and most other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
Further, there is widespread concern in the banking business that the tough new 
stand toward dictators will chase away legitimate clients. 
</P>
<P>
"It presents us with a dilemma," said Jean-Paul Chapius, managing director of 
the Swiss Bankers Assn. "We have taken action to avoid questionable funds from 
coming to Switzerland. They are not worth it to us. . . . The difficulty is 
trying to convince the good clients that they have nothing to fear." 
</P>
<P>
The change in Swiss government attitudes toward dictators and their money began 
in 1986 when the new Philippine government of President Corazon Aquino asked 
Swiss authorities to freeze the Marcos family assets here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Swiss Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1977, when the Swiss signed a mutual assistance agreement with the 
United States and European countries, the Swiss government and banks had agreed 
to cooperate in cases involving drugs and organized crime. However, the 
officials felt then that political cases should not be touched. So when 
Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie was chased from the throne in 1974, the Swiss 
refused to open his account to the new Ethiopian government. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in February, 1979, they declined a request by the revolutionary 
Iranian government to freeze the funds of the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a world where governments come and go," former Swiss Prime Minister 
Kurt Furgler told Parliament at the time, reflecting the prevailing attitude of 
his era. "I ask you: Is it necessary with each change in regimes to wipe out 
all the existing contracts with the previous regime? What would become of our 
credibility as a lawful state?" 
</P>
<P>
But faced with the huge sums cached in Swiss banks by Marcos, the federal 
executive council of Switzerland reversed its position. When an agent for 
Marcos attempted to withdraw $200 million from an account with the large bank 
Credit Suisse, the Swiss leadership balked. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time after World War II," wrote Swiss journalist Jean-Claude 
Buffle in a recent article on the changing Swiss bank regulatory practices, 
"the government subordinated its economic interests to the superior interests 
of our country and its international reputation."

SURPLUS FOOD CUTS STARVE LUNCH PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS

"Schools around the country are having to cope with these massive shortfalls," 
said Kevin Dando, spokesman for the American School Food Service Assn. "This is 
the school year when it's really been a major trauma. The term I keep hearing 
about this is 'the silent erosion of the school lunch program.' " 
</P>
<P>
The loss of bonus commodities could be even more serious for schools if budget 
cuts proposed by President Bush on Monday are enacted. Under the proposed 
budget, the school lunch program will be cut by $180 million in 1991 by making 
it more difficult for families to qualify for free school lunches for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"We're worried about low-income kids not having access to any lunch at all," 
said Edward Cooney, deputy director of the Food and Research Action Center. 
"We're concerned that the health and nutritional status of low-income children 
will be at risk because of the absence of commodities, coupled with the cuts in 
budgets." 
</P>
<P>
After losing more than $7 million in federal food subsidies, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District raised its lunch prices from 50 cents to 75 cents for 
elementary school children and from $1.25 to $1.50 for secondary students. As a 
result, the district says, 1.4 million fewer lunches will be sold at school 
this year, a drop of 13% over the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
For some students, that means no lunch at all, said Stephen Garcia, director of 
the school district's food services branch. For others, "rather than have a 
nutritious meal, they'll buy junk food at the local 7-Eleven or some carbonated 
drink and candy at one of our student stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical meal purchased at a Los Angeles school could include the following: 
burrito or empanada, taco sauce, fresh fruit, apple-oatmeal cookie and milk. It 
is a far cry from a candy and a Coke, and it supplies about one-third of a 
child's recommended daily nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946 to provide such lunches 
"as a measure of national security," after one-third of all draftees rejected 
for service in World War II were found to be physically unfit because of 
nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Billion Cut 
</P>
<P>
The program's most recent problems began with the 1981 Omnibus Reconciliation 
Act, the Reagan Administration's attempt to cut the national budget by $35 
billion and deal with the deficit. As part of the law, the Administration cut 
$1 billion from the school lunch program, said Edward Cooney, deputy director 
of the Food and Research Action Center. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, school districts were promised by the Agriculture Department 
that the cuts would be mitigated with a free flow of government surplus food, 
Cooney said. The foodstuffs were called "bonus commodities," because they were 
given to schools in addition to food and monetary support mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus commodities helped the schools during a difficult time. They also 
helped the federal government, which had stockpiled several billion dollars in 
surplus dairy products in an effort to stabilize the dairy industry. 
</P>
<P>
The surpluses came about because of a policy that turned the federal government 
into the market of last resort for the nation's dairy farmers. If dairy herds 
over-produced and farmers could not sell the surplus, the government bought it. 
By the early 1980s, buying the surplus products was costing the government too 
much money, and storing it added to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus commodity program solved the problem. Its attraction to schools was 
that they could get as many bonus commodities as they could use without waste. 
One of the major items given out was cheese, of which there was so much surplus 
that the government kept it in caves near Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1988 the surpluses began to dwindle, Cooney said, even though the school 
lunch funding cut in 1981 was not replaced. One reason for the drop in 
surpluses, in addition to food-giveaway programs, was the Dairy Termination Act 
of 1985, which paid dairy farmers to go out of business in an effort to cut 
overproduction. Approximately 1.5 million cows were slaughtered through the 
dairy buyout. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986-1987 school year, cafeterias received $442 million in bonus 
commodities from the USDA, said Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the agency. 
In the current fiscal year, that assistance has shrunk to about $125 million; 
about $100 million of that surplus food is butter. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I'm being offered in bonus commodities is butter, and I have 
plenty of butter," said Mary Klatko, director of food and nutrition services 
for Howard County Public Schools in Ellicott City, Md. "We still had cheese all 
of last year in the state of Maryland, right through June. We came back in 
September to no cheese." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the school district is buying cheese and other commodities on the 
open market. Between August and December, 1989, Klatko saw her food prices rise 
18%, largely because of the drought and other natural disasters. Pizza, a 
cafeteria favorite, was hardest hit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paying 17.5 cents per slice (of pizza) last year because of the bonus 
cheese," Klatko said. "I'm now paying 35 cents. . . . I used to offer it every 
day in the elementary schools as an alternate. Now it's the highest priced item 
we have on the menu. I had to cut it to three days a week." 
</P>
<P>
School cafeterias have traditionally been self-sufficient, but the Memphis city 
schools' food service branch will have to borrow from the city's Board of 
Education for the first time next year, to make up for an anticipated loss of 
$1.5 million in surplus food from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in school food service for 20 years, and this is the first year I 
can remember this kind of impact on our program," said Shirley Watkins, 
director of food and nutrition services for the Memphis city schools. "The real 
trauma for all of us is that we do not see any light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Union High School District will lose $160,000 in commodities this 
school year, amounting to about 11% of its total food budget, said Bea Nash, 
food services director. Cutbacks in the availability of certain diary products 
are having the biggest impact. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the district no longer receives non-fat milk, used to make dressings 
for the schools' popular salad bars. And a lack of cheese has made pizza, 
another school favorite, more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, 17% of the students who buy lunch at school have dropped out of 
the program. Last July, facing a $600,000 loss in government commodities, the 
city's Board of Education raised lunch prices by 20 cents, and 305,000 fewer 
lunches will be sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
Needy children who qualify under constantly tightening criteria can still 
receive a free lunch at school. But Jane Boehrer, the San Diego schools' food 
services director, said that moderate- and low-income families are terribly 
"price-sensitive" and are quick to react when school lunch prices are raised. 
</P>
<P>
The result, she said, is dangerous: "A student who is not economically needy 
can become nutritionally needy because of poor management of funds or social 
difficulties in the family. I worry about them. If a child doesn't eat well, 
they don't learn well." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) announced that the Senate Committee 
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry will hold hearings on bonus commodities 
and other nutrition issues in late February. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration's proposed cutbacks are made even worse by the recent 
reduction in surplus commodities available for school lunch programs," said 
Leahy, chairman of the committee. "This makes it tougher for schools to provide 
a decent meal at a decent price."

DEMOCRAT WINS 'ABSENTEE BALLOT' ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Sal Cannella defeated Republican Richard Lang in a special state 
Assembly election Tuesday in the northern San Joaquin Valley that attracted 
widespread attention because of the unprecedented heavy use of absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
With all precincts reporting, Cannella had 31,000 votes or 53%. Lang, who 
garnered 27,000 votes, late Tuesday conceded the race for the 27th Assembly 
District seat, which includes Stanislaus County and part of Merced County. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials estimated that about 60% of the voters who took part in the 
contest cast mail ballots. That is a record in California legislative 
elections, according to the secretary of state's office, and is more than 
double the percentage of absentee ballots cast in state special elections 
during the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Absentee ballots could be returned to the election departments or polling 
stations in both counties until the polls closed at 8 p.m. About 30% of the 
district's registered voters cast ballots Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive pursuit of absentee ballots is becoming an increasingly common 
campaign tactic, and political consultants consider the 27th District contest 
to be a model for how California elections will be waged in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Cannella, 47, a former machinist, has been Stanislaus County Supervisor since 
1982. Lang, 52, who resigned as principal of a high school to run for the 
Assembly, has been a Modesto City Council member for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's special election was called to fill the vacancy left when former 
Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Democrat, won election to Congress last fall. Condit 
replaced Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned amid controversy over his personal 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
With Cannella's victory there now are 46 Democrats and 33 Republicans in the 
state's lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Voting by mail well in advance of the election is an effective campaign tool, 
because these are votes that cannot be swayed by final-hour appeals from the 
opposition. And campaign managers can track voting results well in advance of 
election day and adjust their strategy according to early absentee returns. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, absentee ballots were only used by people unable to visit the 
polls on election day. But restrictions on mail ballots were lifted about 10 
years ago. And in this election, campaign officials attempted to persuade all 
voters to apply for absentee ballots. Both campaigns identified voters using 
computerized data banks and sent out absentee ballot applications to party 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The applications, which included campaign pitches from other politicians, were 
already filled out with the voter's name and address. All voters had to do was 
sign the application and mail it to receive an absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Both campaign staffs followed up with phone calls and door-to-door visits to 
ensure that voters sent in their applications and then mailed in their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for percentage of mail ballots cast was 39%, in the 1987 
special congressional election in San Francisco between Democrat Nancy Pelosi 
and Republican Harriet Ross, said Melissa Warren, a spokeswoman for the 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the reasons the percentage was so high in that contest was because 
so few total votes were cast, said Michael Yaki, an aide to Pelosi, who won the 
election. There was a voter turnout of only 24%, he said.

ASSEMBLY OKS 2 ETHICS BILLS, REJECTS THIRD; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: A MOVE TO CURB LOBBYING BY FORMER LAWMAKERS AND KEY AIDES WAS 
DEFEATED. THE APPROVED BILLS NOW GO TO A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.

<P>
The Assembly on Tuesday easily approved two bills that would create new ethical 
standards for state legislators; one to ban speech honorariums and limit gifts, 
the other to put teeth in the enforcement of conflict-of-interest voting rules. 
</P>
<P>
But the Assembly rejected a third measure that would have prohibited former 
lawmakers and key staff members from lobbying their former colleagues for one 
year after leaving their posts. 
</P>
<P>
The two bills now go to the Senate, which already has approved similar 
legislation. A two-house conference committee is expected to iron out the 
differences between the two versions -- and possibly make substantial changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to rewrite everything in conference committee," said Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who will be a member of the panel. He 
did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has been given impetus by a continuing FBI investigation into 
Capitol corruption that led to the indictment and trial of state Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier) on charges of racketeering, extortion and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to ourselves, to our reputation, and to our future to put this 
program into effect," Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) said before 
the Assembly vote. Vasconcellos chairs a select committee on ethics and 
sponsored the bill dealing with honorariums and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Many Assembly members questioned certain features of the ethics package, and 
Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) called it a "farce." But the bill 
banning honorariums and restricting gifts passed 69 to 1, and the 
conflict-of-interest measure was approved 69 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Along with banning honorariums, which generally are payments legislators 
receive for giving speeches, Vasconcellos' bill limits gifts to lawmakers to 
$100 from a single source in a calendar year. It also would require 
legislators, staff members, and lobbyists to take an ethics course at least 
once every two years, with lobbyists paying the cost of the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents tried but failed to amend the bill to plug what they called an 
honorarium "loophole" that would allow lawmakers who are practicing attorneys 
to be paid by their clients for appearing before public or private agencies to 
argue on the client's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"We either ban honorariums or we don't," said Assemblyman Charles Bader 
(R-Pomona), who offered the losing amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict-of-interest bill, by Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), would 
go beyond present laws that prohibit lawmakers from voting on issues that have 
a direct effect on their personal financial interests. The Lempert bill would 
empower the Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce the law and to 
impose fines of up to $2,000 per violation. Present laws exempt legislators 
from facing fines. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto) to restrict lobbying 
activities of former lawmakers and their aides was defeated when it was backed 
by 39 lawmakers but opposed by 23. A two-thirds majority -- or 54 votes -- was 
required for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst bill of all," said Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville). "Why trash our staff? It's not the staff that's on trial, it's 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Baker contended that the one-year ban on lobbying would make it more difficult 
for the Legislature to attract skilled personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert said he will try to amend the so-called "revolving door" prohibition 
into one of the Senate bills.

A Washington city employee who reportedly has said Mayor Marion Barry smoked 
crack cocaine in 1988 pleaded guilty to a narcotics charge and then testified 
for two hours before a federal grand jury investigating the mayor. James L. 
McWilliams pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of aiding and abetting 
"another person" in the use of crack cocaine Dec. 19, 1988, when Barry 
allegedly used the drug at a downtown Ramada Inn. The Washington Post reported 
that McWilliams had agreed to tell the grand jury that he was in the hotel room 
as Barry smoked crack cocaine.

MOTHER FOUND GUILTY IN DEATH OF 'STOLEN' BABY

A woman suspected of killing two infant daughters whom she claimed were 
abducted was found guilty of first-degree murder Tuesday in one of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was to reconvene today on the question of whether Paula Marie Sims, 
30, should be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for two days before deciding that 6-week-old Heather Lee was 
suffocated by her mother. Heather was one of two baby girls Sims said were 
abducted by a masked gunman under nearly identical circumstances three years 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Madison County prosecutor Donald Weber called it "the hardest case I ever had 
to try." He said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by evidence that 
Sims and her husband, Robert, wanted only male children. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't like little girls and neither did Robert," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
The father has not been charged in either case, but Weber said that because of 
the verdict against Paula Sims, the state's attorney's offices in Madison and 
Jersey counties may seek indictments against the 37-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found the mother guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, two 
counts of obstructing justice and one count of concealing a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
She also has been implicated in the 1986 death of her firstborn, 13-day-old 
Loralei Marie, in Jersey County, but murder has not been charged in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Sims reported in June, 1986, that a masked man with a gun had entered her 
home while she was watching television, made her lie on the floor and fled with 
Loralei. A dead infant girl was found a week later near the Sims' home in 
Brighton, in rural Jersey County. 
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1989, she reported that a masked gunman approached her as she was 
taking out the garbage at home in Alton, in Madison County, where the family 
then lived. She said the man ordered her back into the house, where he knocked 
her unconscious, and that when she awoke Heather was gone.

Drug lords stepped up their public relations blitz, announcing that they have

release a Colombian diplomat abducted Friday in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Warring drug cartels last month staged a number of kidnapings to extort ransom 
but recently have been releasing captives to persuade the government to 
negotiate a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Furthering the public campaign for negotiations, the Medellin cartel late 
Monday issued a communique, purportedly signed by fugitive kingpin Pablo 
Escobar, saying the cocaine traffickers have no plans to assassinate Bush when 
he meets Feb. 15 with Andean leaders in the Colombian port city of Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, wanted for extradition to face drug charges in the United States, also 
denied a report that the traffickers are smuggling shoulder-fired SAM-7 
missiles into Colombia to attack Air Force One as Bush lands. 
</P>
<P>
CBS-TV News reported last week that the Secret Service was investigating a 
drug-ring plot to kill the President during his anti-narcotics summit with the 
leaders of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
In its communique, the Medellin cartel promised to release Roberto Garcia Pena, 
a Colombian official kidnaped last week in Bogota. When freed, Garcia Pena will 
be carrying a message from the cartel, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the cocaine czars offered to surrender if the government agreed 
not to extradite them to the United States. The offer signaled a tactical turn 
away from the bombing onslaught begun last year that killed almost 200 people.

The Senate, by a 98-0 vote, completed congressional action on a long-stalled

He is expected to sign it. Bush had reluctantly accepted the sanctions but 
vetoed the bill last year on other grounds. The bill, which also authorizes 
money to operate the State Department, largely puts into law sanctions that 
Bush imposed in response to Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators 
last June.

U.S. ACCUSES ROMANIA FRONT OF INTIMIDATION 
</P>

<P>
In a formal diplomatic protest, the Bush Administration has accused Romania's 
interim government of a campaign of political intimidation reminiscent of the 
totalitarian methods of deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, it was announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply troubled by what appears to be active intimidation of legitimate 
organizations which are seeking a legitimate, independent role in Romania's new 
political order," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest handed a protest note to the government 
"and asked that the right of all political groups to peaceful protests . . . be 
fully protected." 
</P>
<P>
It was the harshest U.S. criticism of any Eastern European government since a 
wave of anti-Communist reform swept the region last year. The Administration 
complained last week that the Romanian regime appeared to be trying to stifle 
dissent, but the tone was softer. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had considered visiting Bucharest next 
month as part of a trip surrounding meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow Feb. 8-9. But a visit -- a traditional signal 
of U.S. support -- is now out of the question, a senior State Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks a lot different now than it did 10 days ago," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has sent Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for 
human rights and humanitarian affairs, to Bucharest to show concern for the 
regime's deteriorating human rights performance. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front, the self-appointed government that took power 
when Ceausescu was ousted Dec. 22 and executed three days later, has imposed 
strict limitations on demonstrations by opposition political groups. In 
addition, the front organized a counterdemonstration earlier this week that 
ended with violent attacks on the headquarters of opposition political parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be greatly saddened if the hope for democracy and human rights, won at 
such great human cost in Romania, were to be lost by a retreat to the habits 
and practices of an old totalitarian era that should be completely discarded," 
Tutwiler said.

SENATORS SEEK INCREASE IN AID TO EAST BLOC 
</P>

Arguing that President Bush's request for additional aid for Eastern Europe is 
not enough, Senate Democrats unveiled legislation Tuesday to give an additional 
$511 million to fund democratic reform movements in East Bloc countries over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which the Democrats suggested could be funded by further cuts in the 
defense budget, would be added to a $738-million aid package approved last 
November for Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing what amounted to the Democrats' formal response to the Bush 
Administration on the East Bloc aid issue, Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) said the new funds would be used to assist 
democratic reform efforts in East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria 
and Yugoslavia -- countries not covered under the Poland-Hungary bill. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which calls for $211 million more than the Administration 
requested for Eastern Europe in the budget it submitted to Congress on Monday, 
logically would be financed by the so-called "peace divided," Sen. Paul Simon 
(D-Ill.) said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spent something like 2 or 3 trillion dollars on defense since World 
War II to protect us from the military threat posed by Eastern Europe," Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that this threat has diminished, it is extremely important for the 
security of this nation that we gamble on freedom in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Pell's proposal would use the largest portion of the aid, $250 million, to fund 
U.S. participation in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
being established to help East Bloc countries move toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Another $80 million is earmarked for emergency food aid for Romania while $43 
million would be used to promote the development of non-communist political 
parties in several East Bloc states. A portion of that latter amount -- $10 
million -- would be distributed as soon as the bill becomes law in order to 
help emerging political parties prepare for upcoming elections in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Pell described the bill, which would also liberalize trade restrictions and 
provide non-economic forms of assistance such as management training to the 
Soviet Union, as a "modest start" in addressing the profound political changes 
and growing economic needs of Eastern Europe. He predicted that the amount 
being proposed may well increase as the bill winds its way through Congress "in 
view of the profound interest" that lawmakers share in "supporting positive 
developments in Eastern Europe."

DARMAN RESPONDS TO DEMOCRATIC CRITICS WITH OFFER OF BUDGET PLAN COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Under heavy fire from hostile Democrats attacking President Bush's day-old 
spending blueprint, Budget Director Richard G. Darman signaled Tuesday that the 
Administration is ready to negotiate with Congress on alternative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Darman dutifully defended the President's good faith and willingness to make 
tough budget choices even as he hinted at possible compromises in testimony to 
the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), ranking GOP member on the panel, said of the 
new $1.23-trillion budget: "I suspect it's not going to be Congress' cup of 
tea." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Marty Russo (D-Ill.) sharply accused the Administration of concealing the 
true deficit through use of accounting gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
"This budget process stinks and lies," Russo shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, showing signs of flexibility, replied: "I do look forward to 
alternative proposals -- we're not going to walk away from the process." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior Republican on the panel, Rep. Bill Gradison of Ohio, deplored 
the partisan rhetoric but indicated he favored budget changes as well. "The 
Administration has given us its best shot," he said. "Now it's up to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts Called Unrealistic 
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that Bush had proposed unrealistic cuts in popular domestic 
programs that Congress never would accept to achieve a $63.1-billion deficit, 
barely meeting a congressional target that would avoid automatic spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was testy as Darman made his first appearance on Capitol Hill to 
advocate the first budget developed by the Bush Administration, but he got 
faint praise from one Democrat, Rep. Jerry Huckaby of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"You at least have left a mark here where we can negotiate," Huckaby said. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset of the five-hour hearing, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) 
told Darman: "Both Democrats and Republicans will demand greater defense 
reductions, including troop cuts in Europe and high-ticket strategic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that Congress was likely to trim the $306 billion Bush 
proposed for military outlays in the year starting Oct. 1, Darman said 
estimates of the potential size of the "peace dividend" this year were highly 
inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Later, replying to prodding from Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), he added: "I 
agree with you that many Americans want to spend less on defense. I think the 
public has an inflated expectation of what is possible." 
</P>
<P>
While larger than this year's defense budget in dollar terms, the President's 
proposed defense budget for fiscal 1991 represents a reduction of about 2% from 
the amount that would be needed to keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Support for Freeze 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether military outlays could be frozen at the current level, Darman 
replied: "I'd be surprised if you actually go for that. . . . When people 
discover what has to go to get that much (of a cut), they may not vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
A controversial proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) to reduce 
Social Security payroll taxes by $62 billion was criticized by Darman on 
grounds that it would result either in lower retirement benefits or an 
offsetting increase in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that he (Moynihan) never intended the plan to be taken 
as seriously as it was by the media," Darman said. "He intended to use it as a 
bargaining wedge." 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Panetta, however, said that he had spoken to the New York lawmaker. 
"He's quite serious about the proposal," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpest criticism of the director of the Office of Management and Budget, 
however, came from Russo, an eight-term Chicago Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick, you don't know what a tough choice is," Russo told Darman. "A tough 
choice for me is cutting $5 billion from Medicare. A tough choice for you is 
soaking the rich, raising their taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Darman argued, however, that the President's proposals to deny cost-of-living 
increases for retired federal employees and to lower Medicare payments to 
hospitals and doctors by $5.5 billion have been politically costly for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hints at Compromise 
</P>
<P>
When Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) told him it was not possible for Congress to 
reduce Medicare outlays again this year, Darman again signaled his willingness 
to settle for less. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect to get every dime," he said. "Let's take smaller steps if we 
can't take larger steps." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said the Administration was ready to discuss its proposal to 
terminate a farmers' crop insurance program if Congress gave some assurances 
that it would restrain the cost of drought relief or other farm disaster 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're flexible," Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike past occasions when he has charmed members of the committee with his 
quick wit, however, the hearing Tuesday was marked by angry outbursts and 
clashing opinions. 
</P>
<P>
When Darman, for example, told Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) that the public does 
not care about the federal deficit, she snapped: "I think you're dead wrong."

ESCAPE ARTIST'S MOTHER ACCUSED OF AIDING NEW PLOT

<P>
The aged mother of Ronald McIntosh, a California man serving a 25-year sentence 
for plucking his inmate lover out of prison in a dramatic helicopter escape in 
1986, has been charged with helping her son in a new escape plot, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret McIntosh, 76, of Seattle, has been charged with conspiring to help her 
son escape from San Mateo County Jail. Also charged in the case is Ernest Lail, 
who was a cellmate of Ronald McIntosh's at the federal prison at Leavenworth, 
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Zanides, who prosecuted Ronald McIntosh for the 1986 
escape, said he expects to charge him later in connection with the new plot. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret McIntosh was arraigned in Seattle last week and is free on bail. She 
is expected to be brought to San Francisco to face trial. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities said they discovered last July that Ronald McIntosh, 45, 
was considering an escape attempt from Leavenworth. But the officials said that 
plot was foiled when San Mateo County authorities charged him with a 1984 
murder and transferred him to their jail to await trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to a search warrant affidavit, McIntosh, his mother, Lail, and others 
began conspiring to help McIntosh escape from the county jail. Lail is serving 
a 64-year sentence at Leavenworth for bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, as yet unidentified co-conspirators planned to use 
automatic weapons to free McIntosh as he was transported to court proceedings. 
An alternate plan was to take Superior Court Judge John Runde hostage in 
exchange for McIntosh, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh's troubles began with a gold futures enterprise he ran in Marin County 
in the mid-1980s. He was convicted of defrauding investors of $18 million and 
sentenced to 18 months in federal prison at Pleasanton, Calif., in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1986, McIntosh disappeared after he was given a bus ticket from 
Pleasanton and told to travel unsupervised to a minimum-security prison at 
Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, McIntosh, a veteran who flew helicopters in combat in 
Vietnam, commandeered a helicopter at gunpoint in San Jose and flew to the yard 
at Pleasanton. There, his lover, Dorinda Lopez, a convicted bank robber serving 
a 50-year sentence, waited. The couple evaded capture for 10 days, but were 
arrested at a jewelry store in a Sacramento shopping mall where they had 
stopped to pick up wedding rings they had purchased earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was sentenced to five additional years for the escape. 
</P>
<P>
In San Mateo County, McIntosh is facing charges that he paid $53,000 to a hit 
man, Drax Quartermain, to kill a business associate. Quartermain was convicted 
of the murder and is on San Quentin's Death Row.

</P>
<P>
None of the temblors registered higher than magnitude 2.9, a spokesman for the 
Caltech seismology lab in Pasadena said. The epicenter was 25 miles north of 
town, near the Salton Sea, the spokesman said. The quakes occurred in the 
Brawley seismic zone, a complex web of faults. Seismologists reported similar 
waves of small quakes have struck the region before.

The San Diego Zoological Society has suspended relations with a Kansas animal 
dealer who said he took four endangered addax antelope from the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park to a Missouri auction in 1985. Zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said ties 
with Jim Fouts were severed in October because of "suspicions" that he did 
business with wild animal auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo and others nationwide condemn the sale or transfer of any 
animals to auctions, where some end up at private hunting farms whose clients 
pay to kill and mount the wildlife for trophies. Fouts confirmed to The Times 
that he took the four addax to an auction in Cape Girardeau, Mo. He said two of 
the animals were bought by a private collector and the others were sold to the 
highest bidder. Fouts also said he was unaware of the San Diego Zoo's decision 
to stop dealing with him.

<P>
Operators of a hazardous waste dump alongside San Pablo Bay in Contra Costa 
County have agreed to pay more than $6 million to complete closure of the site, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of drums of refinery wastes, pesticides and other dangerous 
substances have been collected at the West Contra Costa County Sanitary 
Landfill in Richmond, officials said. The site was operated as a waste dump 
from 1952 to 1987. In a suit filed last fall, the state accused the operator, 
Richmond Sanitary Service, of failing to get the required approval from the 
state Health Services Department for its closure plan.

SUIT SAYS SCHOOL STAFF SCALDED RETARDED YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retarded 17-year-old boy was nearly killed at an Orange County-run school 
after staff members immersed him in scalding water "to cause injury and 
punishment" for defecating in his pants, according to a suit filed by his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that Robert Herrell was immersed in 150-degree bath water and 
suffered second- and third-degree burns over 35% to 40% of his body while 
attending George Key Special Center in Placentia last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia police said they investigated and confirmed that Herrell had been 
severely scalded. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen Harper said no charges were 
filed because criminal intent could not be proved. "There was no evidence that 
this was done purposely," she said. "There may have been negligence, but I was 
not convinced that this rose to the level of criminal negligence." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald D. Wenkart, senior attorney for the county Department of Education, said 
Tuesday that he had not received a copy of the civil suit, and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Santa Ana Superior Court by Judy L. Bates, seeks unspecified 
damages and payment of her son's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint states that Herrell had the mental capacity "of an infant between 
the age of 6 months and 18 months" at the time of the incident, but his 
condition has worsened because of the scalding and he can no longer live at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Herrell was supposed to have been supervised by a 
teacher identified as Carol Cornell on June 30, 1989. But while Cornell was at 
lunch, two teacher's aides, Donna Pullen and Sabrina Murphy, cared for Herrell. 
</P>
<P>
"About this time, Robert Herrell had defecated upon himself and in some manner 
or way wiped the debris upon his body," the suit says. "Donna Pullen and 
Sabrina Murphy then subjected Robert Herrell in the bath water heated to 
approximately 150 degrees; all the while they protected themselves by wearing 
gloves or otherwise not touching the scalding water. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Robert Herrell does not speak and is . . . severely developmentally 
disabled, he sat . . . in the scalding water while his skin ruptured and 
burned."

ACLU TAKES CASE OF LATINOS ARRESTED AT CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local ACLU announced Tuesday that it is pressing three new cases involving 
religious freedoms, including an incident last fall in which two ministers of a 
Latino church in North County were handcuffed and removed from their Sunday 
services by sheriff's deputies responding to a noise complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The other two cases concern the cross atop Mt. Helix and the cross emblazoned 
on the shoulder patches of the La Mesa police uniform. But it was the intrusion 
by San Diego County deputies into the Apostolic Church of the Faith of Jesus 
Christ that drew the most ire from the ACLU officials. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the church leaders being arrested during the service in Fallbrook, 
the officials said, one deputy flung a Bible in the air and the church flag was 
knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
"The image of them being arrested and handcuffed is truly one of the most 
repugnant images we can think of in a country that protects religious 
freedoms," said Betty Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil Liberties 
Union Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties. 
</P>
<P>
D. Dwight Worden, the ministers' attorney who is working with the rights group 
to defend the preachers against the disturbing-the-peace complaint, added: 
</P>
<P>
"The maximum penalty for this infraction is only a $250 fine, but I can tell 
you that I'm taking it as one of the most serious cases I've ever handled." 
</P>
<P>
But sheriff's reports describing the Oct. 15 arrest said that about 20 
complaints were filed in a four-month period because of noise from the tiny 
church, whose services are animated. The church on Kalmia Street is in a 
residential area, and neighbors were upset because the congregation's public 
address system disturbed the neighborhood quiet. The neighbors said they were 
unable to take naps or hear television. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies' reports said the church leaders had been warned repeatedly about 
noise complaints, but, on Sunday afternoon Oct. 15, there was loud "yelling, 
pounding, clapping, and chanting." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Dan Megna and Linda Powell received a signed complaint from Norene 
Brock, who lives in an apartment complex just south of the church. The officers 
went inside the church, crowded with about 70 worshipers, including children. 
</P>
<P>
"The congregation was standing with their hands over their head, eyes closed, 
chanting," the officers' reports said. "A minister was standing behind a 
(lectern) yelling into a P.A. system to the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
The pastor, Daniel Perez, stood in the deputies' way and refused to move or 
cooperate, according to the reports. "He kept saying basically God was in 
control, not him. At no time did he attempt to quiet the group or offer to turn 
off the P.A. system," the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor was arrested and handcuffed by Megna when "he put his hands out in 
front of him and said, 'Go ahead,' " the report said. While Perez was taken to 
the patrol car outside, an assistant pastor, Reynaldo Flores Pizano, was 
clinging to the lectern as he was being arrested by Powell. 
</P>
<P>
"She said he began to incite the congregation when I arrested Perez," Megna 
said in his report. "The crowd was much louder at this point, chanting and 
yelling. At one point, the congregation became so loud and unruly that I 
requested additional deputies from Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department investigators impounded the church's public address 
system, which they are using as evidence for the March 12 trial in Municipal 
Court in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, who speak only Spanish, could not be contacted Tuesday. But, 
in the deputies' reports, it is clear that Perez and Pizano did not believe 
they were bothering their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just praising the Lord," Perez was quoted as telling the deputies when 
they asked him to turn down the P.A. system. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU's Wheeler and defense attorney Worden suggested Tuesday that there may 
be racial overtones in the case because the church has a Latino congregation 
and the arresting deputies are white. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial reaction is that I'm suspicious of that issue," Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
However, except for defending the two arrested church leaders, Worden said he 
has not lodged a formal complaint with the sheriff's internal affairs unit, nor 
has he filed a civil claim or lawsuit against the department. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Cooke, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said he was unaware 
of allegations that a Bible was tossed from the lectern into the lap of one of 
the worshipers or of the flag being knocked over. He also denied any racial 
motivation in the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that would be the case," he said. "This has been an ongoing 
situation. But I can't imagine there would be any kind of racial overtones to 
this." 
</P>
<P>
In the other cases, the ACLU filed federal lawsuits Tuesday against San Diego 
County, alleging that county officials violate the doctrine of separation of 
church and state by maintaining the Christian cross affixed atop Mt. Helix. 
</P>
<P>
The cross, county amphitheater and park atop Mt. Helix were deeded to the 
county in 1929, and county officials routinely spend taxpayers' money by 
keeping them clean of graffiti and other problems, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Latin cross is a religious symbol of Christianity," she said in the 
lawsuit. "The permanent display of the cross on Mt. Helix conveys an 
unmistakable message of government endorsement of the Christian faith." 
</P>
<P>
However Robert Lerner, a county spokesman, said no government money is used to 
maintain the cross. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing improper and there's nothing illegal about having the cross 
there," he said. "There isn't anything to maintain. We maintain the trees and 
the grounds in the park, but the cross is just there." 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU filed a second federal lawsuit against the city of La Mesa, saying 
that it is a constitutional violation for La Mesa police officers to wear 
shoulder patches depicting a cross. 
</P>
<P>
However, La Mesa police and city officials contend that the emblems are simply 
symbolic of the Mt. Helix-La Mesa area and carry no religious significance.

CHP OFFICERS ON CYCLES NOW PATROL CALIFORNIA 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California 78 has been referred to as a 17-mile-long parking lot. During rush 
hour, or whenever there is an accident on the highway, driving is reduced to a 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the increasing congestion, the California Highway Patrol in 
Oceanside has assigned motorcycle officers to monitor traffic from Oceanside to 
Escondido on California 78. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are more flexible in moving through traffic on motorcycles than in 
patrol cars, Officer Len Schroeder said. The first motorcycle officer began 
patrolling in August, and four more have been added. Another officer will be 
assigned to the highway soon. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 15 years since CHP motorcycle officers patrolled North County 
highways. They were taken off in 1974 because of a high injury rate, Schroeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of motorcycles is up to the commander in each CHP district. They 
are widely used in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hazardous job," Schroeder said. "You never know when a car will pull 
out in front of an officer. When an officer falls on a bike, it's not the same 
as having the protection of a car." 
</P>
<P>
He said the officers have to go to California Highway Patrol Academy in 
Sacramento for two weeks of intensive training. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a 70% failure rate at the academy, with most flunking out the first 
week," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
The training begins with the basics. The officers have to learn the parts of 
the motorcycle and are taught how to ride slowly before being trained on a 
high-speed track. 
</P>
<P>
The five officers rotate on a split shift, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. They will 
also patrol unincorporated roads adjoining their beat. 
</P>
<P>
Once a relatively uncrowded route, California 78 has in recent years become 
North County's most congested highway. In 1987, $15 million in federal funds 
was allocated to widen the east-west highway from four to six lanes along a 
17-mile stretch from Oceanside to Escondido, at a total cost of more than $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said construction on the highway has shrunk the road and contributed 
to the traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, traffic volume has increased 73% on California 78, and accidents 
have increased by 200%. Because of booming growth, the number of cars using the 
highway peaks at 113,000 daily in some areas, Schroeder said. The road is 
designed to handle 65,000 cars a day.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN SLAYING RECAPTURED AFTER ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police captured a man Tuesday who had escaped a day earlier from a police 
holding cell after his arrest for investigation of a man's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Gonzalez, 27, was arrested the second time at an undisclosed Culver City 
location that had been put under surveillance, said Los Angeles Police 
Department spokeswoman Sharyn Michelson. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was first arrested Monday morning along with Robert Luna, 30, in 
connection with the bludgeoning death of Joseph Mancino, 52, of Los Feliz, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were taken into custody after an officer who stopped the car they were 
driving and found that one of them was carrying Mancino's identification, said 
Michelson. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang officers had stopped the car in which they were riding in a probe of 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Mancino was later found in the apartment listed on the 
identification, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez escaped from the holding cell in the Police Department's Northeast 
Station between 12:30 and 1 p.m.

The anonymous call was received about 1 p.m. as Singapore Airlines Flight 11 
prepared to begin its taxi to take off for Tokyo and Singapore, said Bob 
Candiotti, an airline spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was diverted to a remote area on the western edge of the airport 
where 253 passengers and 21 crew members were taken off and bused to a 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
No explosives were found during a search of the plane, and the airliner was 
cleared for takeoff at 4 p.m., Officer Ron Bremer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's Criminal Conspiracy Section was investigating the

A THIRD JURY IS CONVENED TO DECIDE ON SANITY OF MURDERER OF 5 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A third jury has been convened to determine the sanity of a Lebanese convicted 
of murdering his wife and four family members. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution and defense attorneys told jurors in their opening statements 
Monday that experts will give their views about the sanity of Toufic (Tom) 
Naddi when he killed his 26-year-old wife, Aida, her parents, a cousin and 
brother-in-law five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the panel determines that Naddi was sane at the time, they will then hear 
more evidence before considering whether he should be executed for the slayings 
or spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
If they find he was insane at the time, Naddi, now 49, could be committed to a 
mental institution or could be freed if he is deemed recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi's in-laws, Habib Sabbagh, 73, and his wife, Lillian Sabbagh, 58, were 
members of a wealthy and prominent family from Amman, Jordan. Aida Naddi's 
brother-in-law, Osama Mashini, 38, was a popular comedian in Jordan. Also slain 
was Michael Sabbagh, 38. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were shot in the head as they slept at the Naddis' home in El Cajon 
during a visit in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors who convicted Naddi in 1988 of five first-degree murders deadlocked 11 
to 1 in the sanity phase of the trial, with the majority finding the defendant 
was sane. 
</P>
<P>
During the guilt phase of his trial, Naddi testified that he shot his sleeping 
relatives because his wife told him she had been involved in an incestuous 
relationship with her father for years. He also said she offered him money to 
leave their marriage and give her custody of their two children. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi also testified that he thought God had set the scene for him, and that he 
acted as "God's executioner" in carrying out the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
A mistrial was declared in Naddi's second sanity hearing when Superior Court 
Judge Terry O'Rourke ruled that the prosecutor made prejudicial remarks during 
his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual aspect of the case, Naddi was married Dec. 1 to a paralegal who 
assisted the defense team during his 1988 murder trial. Naddi and Carol Moore 
were married in a County Jail ceremony witnessed by two of his children and 
three of Moore's children.

The difficulty of solving crowding in Southeast San Diego schools continued to 
vex city schools trustees Tuesday as they wrestled with a number of proposed 
temporary solutions, beginning with the fall term. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of several planned sessions on the issue, the board met into the 
evening on ways to juggle 32 existing portable classrooms, to build 20 more and 
to open an unused school in Clairemont so the district can bus sixth-grade 
students from Sherman, Balboa and Brooklyn elementaries in Southeast to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The board indicated that it no longer considers expansion of multitrack, 
year-round schools its major solution to crowding, responding to complaints by 
angry residents of the predominantly Latino and black Southeast area that their 
students have borne the brunt of the complex year-round schedules and have 
suffered academically. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees will take up the issue again next week. Potential long-term solutions 
for new schools could cost up to $50 million and will also be discussed over 
the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The district now has no funds to carry attempt permanent solutions beyond 
construction of more portable classrooms and busing children to under-used 
schools in other neighborhoods.

A San Diego man was sentenced to 15 months in prison Monday for helping his 
bosses swindle $6 million from investors who bought old coins from an Orange 
County business. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Thompson, 28, formerly of Orange, had pleaded guilty to one count of wire 
fraud stemming from his activities as sales administrator of the now-defunct 
Marco Numismatics, which operated in Costa Mesa from 1985 to 1988, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the prison term, U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, sitting in Santa 
Ana, ordered Thompson to pay $7,000 restitution, Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing ends a case that saw seven men found guilty of federal crimes 
linked to the scam. Some were convicted at trial; others pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The father-son team that ran the business, Vincent L. Caterino, 59, of 
Riverside and James N. Caterino, 29, of Costa Mesa, were sentenced to prison 
this month for masterminding the high-pressure phone sales operation. They were 
convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Salesmen persuaded investors to buy rare or old coins that were vastly 
overvalued.

A Rancho Penasquitos health and fitness center, which opened last November, was 
destroyed in a four-alarm fire, San Diego Fire Department Capt. Al MacDonald 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The club is part of the Carmel Highland Golf and Tennis Resort, 14455 
Penasquitos Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started at 6:52 p.m. Monday and swept through the single-story 
commercial building, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department estimated the loss at $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
A faulty electrical panel caused the blaze, MacDonald said. It took 120 
firefighters from several fire departments three hours to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters left the building when they feared the ceilings would collapse, 
MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no deaths or injuries, he said, adding that an employee and two 
members of the club were inside when smoke was seen coming from the top of the 
electrical panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire hasn't affected business," said general manager Charles Nehme. 
"Business will continue as usual. We will use other areas of the resort until 
the center is rebuilt in about three or four months." 
</P>
<P>
Nehme said the 176-room resort opened in September, and the health club opened 
Nov. 1.

The San Diego Unified School District could face a $3.6-million deficit for its 
1990-91 budget under early projections made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The annual January planning budget is always subject to substantial revisions 
in the spring, however, after changes in the projected state budget are made by 
the Legislature, which provides most of the money for education. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators are planning new programs for opening an elementary and 
middle school, for improving basic skills curriculum at the junior-high level, 
for improving school security by hiring five more safety officers and for 
allowing up to 70 elementary school teachers to have class preparation time. 
The budget calls for a 2.79% pay increase for employees, using the state 
cost-of-living adjustment agreed to by employee bargaining organizations two 
years ago.

ELKS LODGE'S 1ST BLACK MEMBER SAYS HE DID NOT SET OUT TO BREAK COLOR BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first black to join the Van Nuys Elks Lodge after a months-long controversy 
over its racial policies said he took the lodge's secret initiation rites 
Tuesday because he wants to continue watching televised sports there, but as a 
member, not as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Harvey, 41, of Pacoima said he did not intentionally set out to break a 
color barrier when he told lodge members late last year that he wanted to 
become a member after watching about seven football games on Monday nights with 
friends at the lodge's bar on Friar Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked, 'What do you have to do to be a part of this, to get a card to get in 
anytime you want?' " Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's casual interest in joining the lodge coincided with a state 
investigation into allegations of racism in the fraternal organization. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office has been investigating whether the lodge 
violated state civil rights laws in September by twice rejecting two blacks who 
applied for membership. 
</P>
<P>
Lodge spokesman Dan Davis said at the time that the two men were not turned 
down because of their race, but because other members -- who must approve 
applicants by a two-thirds vote -- resented the involvement of state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana), who nominated them. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the lodge accepted Harvey, who was nominated by the club's exalted 
ruler, George Aguilar, at a closed meeting, with 59 of its 300 members voting. 
The lodge did not reveal the result of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure when the vote went down, there were some 'nos,' " Harvey said. "But 
my philosophy is you treat people the way you want to be treated -- with 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
During the fall football season, he frequently watched games on television in 
the club's bar as Aguilar's guest, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Harvey, a laminating plant manager, became the first black recipient 
of the lodge's membership badge -- a gold Elk lapel pin -- after swearing 
eternal brotherhood with fellow members in a secret initiation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to ride a goat or anything like that to get in," said Steve 
Duchscherer, a past exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge. "It's a very nice, 
quiet ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, as the 
organization is officially known, Harvey is entitled to visit lodges 
nationwide, including the opulent Long Beach club, which boasts an "endless" 
bar, actually an illusion created by mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey also must observe a hallowed tradition of the 126-year-old club, said a 
member who asked not to be identified. Every evening at 11, Elks members are 
supposed to take a moment to silently remember departed Elks. If they happen to 
be in an Elks club, a bell will strike 11 times and members are supposed to 
join hands in remembrance of their deceased brethren, the Elk said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do whatever the members do," Harvey said Tuesday in his split-level, 
four-bedroom brown stucco house on a hillside overlooking the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, a long-distance runner, has a crossed right eye from a childhood 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
He was raised in Memphis, where his mother worked as a maid, and remembers 
segregated schools and public facilities. "You couldn't go in certain doors or 
sit in certain places." 
</P>
<P>
He said he feels that discrimination still "happens every day, but that's their 
problem. We work hard and contribute to society. If they don't like us, that's 
too bad." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his wife, Therese, attended a fund-raiser at the lodge last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"As the only black people there, they sure looked at us," Therese said. "But as 
the night went on, they started coming over and talking to us, and I think they 
decided we're not so bad after all."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN WALKING ON STREET IS KIDNAPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall woman was forced into a car and kidnaped, apparently by a man who was 
romantically interested in her, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Marixa Sandoval Mendez, 20, was kidnaped about 6:30 p.m. Monday by Nery Oswaldo 
Lopez, 26, of Newhall, who pulled alongside her as she walked on Arch Street 
toward 6th Street in Newhall, Deputy Dean Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez's mother, who was walking about 150 feet behind the young woman, told 
deputies the man abducted her daughter in a maroon 1980 Honda, Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville said Mendez, a Guatemalan, has lived in the United States for less 
than a month. He said Lopez told her brother he was attracted to her, but 
family members told deputies the two had no relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies described Lopez as 5 feet, 4 inches tall and 165 pounds, with black 
hair and brown eyes. Mendez was described as 5 feet, 4 inches tall and 110 
pounds, with reddish-brown hair and brown eyes.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK SCHOOLS STUDY NEW BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank Unified School District may change its boundaries so that more 
Luther Burbank Junior High School students will attend John Burroughs High 
School in the fall, district officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is designed to balance enrollment at Burbank's two high schools to 
keep comparable educational programs at the schools, said Arthur N. Pierce, 
district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of state funding a school receives is based on its enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for students who live between Victory Boulevard and Empire 
Avenue to go to Burroughs, Pierce said. Previously, only students who lived 
south of Victory Boulevard went to Burroughs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 170 more students are attending Burbank High School. District officials 
project that if the boundaries are not changed, that number will increase to 
400 by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Board of Education may consider the boundary change as early as 
next month, Pierce said. If approved, the plan would be implemented in the 
fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would give ninth-graders at Luther Burbank Junior High who live in the 
affected neighborhood until September to choose between the two high schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why do City Council members meander the council chambers and constantly talk 
during public meetings? That was the question I asked myself when I took the 
time from work to attend the council's "ethics" hearings. I knew why I was 
there. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to participate in democracy, show my support for reform and listen to 
and observe democracy at work. However, it was quite clear that public hearings 
don't involve much listening at all. 
</P>
<P>
Prestigious citizens gave earnest testimony about the importance of reform in 
city government. Meanwhile, council members snacked on crackers, joked with the 
bailiffs and conversed with staff. It is understandable that council members 
have matters to attend to during these hearings which require some 
communication with their staff, etc. 
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of common courtesy by council members to persons giving 
testimony and the obvious lack of real interest in hearing what they had to say 
was inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics in government is only one piece of the puzzle. Democratic government 
requires that citizens have the opportunity to meaningfully participate in 
local government and receive the respect that they, as citizens, deserve. And 
unless citizens such as myself can feel wanted and listened to by their elected 
officials both inside and outside the public forum, then the process is one big 
joke, albeit a sad one.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reported on Jan. 19 that the City Council passed a new law which will 
violate every citizen's right to recall an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
The new "ethics reform measure," introduced by Councilman Hal Bernson, requires 
all five sponsors of recall petitions to individually submit full financial 
disclosure statements before they are allowed to begin a recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
The same disclosure rules will apply to all sponsors of city initiative drives, 
such as the two-term limit initiative now being circulated. 
</P>
<P>
This outrageous new law will force anyone wishing to file for a recall to 
disclose all of his assets and income, which is a deliberate intimidation of 
voters and a blatant invasion of privacy. It is designed to eliminate citizen 
participation in city initiative drives and recalls against elected officials.

LOS ANGELES ETHICS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was greatly disturbed to hear of the tragic fate of Los Angeles Councilman 
Michael Woo's ethics bill in City Council chambers (Jan. 19, 20, 22). To hear 
how council members stripped and weakened the bill in order to keep the perks 
of their positions was both revealing and shocking. 
</P>
<P>
This is a time of moral crisis of leaders in business (Ivan Boesky, Michael 
Milken, et al), religion (Jimmy Swaggart, etc.) and government (the Keating 
Five and Mayor Tom Bradley). Yet the problems of ethics in government is 
possibly the most damaging and insidious. Ours is a democratic nation where 
politicians are given the responsibility to lead and represent all 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
It would be hoped that the Los Angeles City Council would have the foresight, 
thoughtfulness and leadership to take a strong stand on ethics. Instead, we 
read how council members argued about amendments concerning gifts of 
"calendars, ballpoint pens and candy."

FDA'S PROCEDURES ON AZT APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Get It to the Right People Faster," (Jan. 18) is mistaken in 
accusing the Food and Drug Administration of needlessly delaying the approval 
of zidovudine (AZT) to treat people at earlier stages of HIV infection. The 
editorial even referred incorrectly to the agency as the "Federal Drug 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Even many of the FDA's severest critics recognize the circumstances surrounding 
this case and have not blamed the agency for any alleged delays. They realize 
that the agency, by law, cannot approve new uses for a drug until the drug's 
sponsors provide clinical data showing that a drug is safe and effective for 
its proposed use in its intended population. Without this clinical evidence, 
the agency cannot reliably review or approve new indications for a drug. 
</P>
<P>
Would the editorial's authors prefer the agency to callously approve drugs 
without this knowledge, and thereby subject large numbers of patients to 
unknown risks? 
</P>
<P>
FDA is committed to expediting its review and approval once it has the 
necessary evidence to show safety and efficacy. Just this month, for example, 
FDA approved new lower dose recommendations for zidovudine after taking less 
than a month to review the clinical data that had been submitted on this new 
dose. 
</P>
<P>
As a public institution, FDA expects, and even welcomes, informed criticism of 
its policies and action. 
</P>
<P>
But, when a publication of the stature of The Times chooses to use the agency 
as a convenient scapegoat on such an important issue, without bothering to get 
the facts straight, it serves no useful purpose to people with AIDS and the 
rest of the public.

Why is it necessary for presumably objective journalists to characterize 
Nicaragua as "leftist" when noting that Nicaragua opposed the invasion of 
Panama by rightist United States military aggressors ("World Reaction to 
Noriega's Arrest," Jan. 5)? Centrist Spain, left-centrist Mexico and the 
leftist Soviet Union also opposed the intervention, but their political 
persuasions were not worthy of comment. Your staff even failed to observe the 
"rightishness" of Britain, Japan and Thailand.

In The Times, Council President John Ferraro "quietly" proposed a pay increase 
of $24,635 for the council members, a salary increase of $41,000-plus for the 
mayor and for the city attorney, an increase of $35,925 (Jan. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Do these egotistical politicians actually feel they are worth this increase? 
The article states, "The Council tinkered with the idea of the right of city 
officials to accept gifts of ballpoint pens, candy, calendars and mementos." 
Now there's a thought-provoking subject for further study! 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many homeless could be provided with food and shelter for this 
amount? 
</P>
<P>
How many elderly, poor and needy could be provided with health care?

NOT SO FAST, SACRAMENTO

<TEXT>
<P>
The unanimous decision of the California Court of Appeal on indigent 
health-care funding is a victory for responsible government as well as for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators, driven by budget pressures, removed thousands of medically 
indigent adults from the rolls of Medi-Cal in 1982 and dumped their medical 
problems on the already-strapped county health departments of the state. Now 
the court has ordered rectification of that unjust action and correction of the 
financial disruption it caused. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal found that the Legislature had violated the Gann 
constitutional spending limit, which requires that the state fully fund any 
mandate or program shifted to other government entities. That provision of the 
Gann initiative was essential in guarding against just this sort of maneuver to 
evade the budget limits. 
</P>
<P>
It is calculated that the state was paying about $1 billion to provide health 
services to the affected indigent population through Medi-Cal. Instead of 
continuing that level of funding when the responsibility was forced on the 
counties, the state provided only $520 million the first year, an amount that 
has dwindled in subsequent years even as the case loads have risen. 
</P>
<P>
"The state will be obligated to rectify this tremendous under-funding of 
medical care for literally hundreds of thousands of people in California," Lois 
Salisbury said. She is an attorney with Public Advocates Inc., of San 
Francisco, which participated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles County, the county most impacted by poverty in the state, this 
could bring $150 million to $200 million annually in additional state funding, 
according to Robert Gates, head of the county Department of Health Services. 
But all counties will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision that has tremendous fiscal ramifications for the state," 
Asher Rubin, the deputy state attorney general who defended the state in the 
litigation, commented. Yes, indeed. But a correction is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The finding confirms what critics long have been saying: that the state 
government is under-funded. Nothing illustrates better the folly of inadequate 
funding of public services than medical programs for the indigent. The denial 
and reduction of services that resulted from the funding cuts made over the 
last eight years produced no real savings. On the contrary, the denial of 
primary care and prevention programs only serves to postpone appropriate 
services until costly interventions are required.

If Gov. Deukmejian did very much driving in the traffic congestion and gridlock 
in Southern California, he would or should ask, "How long has this been going 
on?" The correct answer would be at least as long as the eight years of his 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
This traffic situation has developed despite his many pre-election campaign 
promises not to follow in the footsteps of the Brown/Gianturco "do-nothing"

<P>
The questions have never bothered Simon Keith. But he can't stand the sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
He meets so many people who want to mother him. This is strange, his father 
will tell you, because his mother doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps that is because she knows what he is all about and knows better 
than to try to tell him what he should and shouldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Keith is a 24-year-old from Victoria, Canada, who plays forward for the 
Cleveland Crunch, an expansion team in the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when he was playing for a Canadian developmental team and 
attending the University of Victoria, Keith began experiencing unusual fatigue 
after games. His hands would get numb, his feet cold. After consulting a number 
of doctors and undergoing two heart biopsies, it was determined that he had an 
infection called viral myocarditis, which often results from complications of 
the flu and can do extensive damage to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
The solution Keith was given by his cardiologist was clear, if not simple. He 
needed a heart transplant or he would die in six months. On July 7, 1986, 
Keith, who had been on life support systems for several weeks, underwent 
surgery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, England, and was given the heart of 
a 17-year-old boy who had died the previous day of a brain hemorrhage while 
playing soccer in Wales. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was successful. For the first time in months, Keith could feel 
his fingers and toes. It was such a dramatic change. He remembers nothing of 
the three weeks before the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"The blood was flowing through my veins again," he said. "It's very simple. I 
felt good." 
</P>
<P>
And he recovered at a rate that amazed everybody, except, of course, his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is a rookie in professional soccer. Because his story is unique, he is 
constantly doing interviews for newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 
When the Crunch travels, his teammates nap on game day from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. 
Keith talks to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A sample of the list: People, Sports Illustrated, Soccer Digest, CBS Today, 
P.M. Magazine, Inside Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Keith has no problems with the attention. He is aware his situation is unusual, 
so he figures the question-and-answer sessions come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something that seems almost normal to me now," he says. "It doesn't 
bother me. I've heard every question in the book. People want to hear about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Keith is also realistic about why people are intrigued. He has a pretty good 
handle on human nature, twisted as it may be. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come to the games just to see if I'm going to keel over," he 
says. "It's terrible, but I mean let's face it, we all like to rubber neck at 
accidents and stuff. We all like to see stuff like that. If it's good for the 
league and brings people through the turnstiles . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people are sitting there thinking 'I hope he keels over.' But if 
I go down, they're thinking 'That's him. Let's see if he gets up.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not putting down human nature. But it exists." 
</P>
<P>
There are also the people who meet Keith but don't know him well. They are the 
ones who want to be his mother, or his doctor, or whatever they can be to get 
their two cents in about the appropriate life style for a guy who has had a 
heart transplant. They might ask him if he should really be eating that kind of 
food, or doing that much exercise or drinking a beer. And that gets old. Fast. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing. 
</P>
<P>
Keith would just as soon not be viewed as a miracle of science. He is a good 
soccer player, who some day wants to be a great one. He makes the same mistakes 
all rookies do and sits on the bench for much of the game. For now, his 
potential is tucked away. He won't be a standout until he learns the nuances of 
indoors, which is vastly different from the outdoor game he played with such 
skill at Nevada Las Vegas, where he was named All-Big West Conference in 1987 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The way Keith looks at it, his medical history has nothing to do with his life. 
He lives. He plays. He even gets impatient with others who have been down the 
same road. 
</P>
<P>
"A problem I find with transplant patients is that they're so wrapped up in 
themselves," Keith says. "They think that they really have survived the No. 1 
futuristic operation of all time, and they think they're so wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to separate from that. It bothers me a lot. A lot of groups still 
approach me and say 'Will you speak at this and speak at that?' And it's better 
for me to really say 'No,' because I'm basically going to talk down to them and 
say, 'Look, you guys are conning yourselves.' I really don't think it's a big 
deal. I think it's a psychological big deal, and people have to get past that. 
And it's sad for people who can't." 
</P>
<P>
Keith went to one support group meeting after his transplant. About 25 people 
attended, all transplant patients from British Columbia. Keith was sitting next 
to one guy who stood up, gave his name and said: "I'm going back to work next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Keith asked: "How long ago was your transplant?" 
</P>
<P>
He responded: "Almost a year now." 
</P>
<P>
And Keith was thinking, "I'm out of here. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get out of there quick enough. I went once, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Keith, younger and in far better shape than most transplant patients going into 
the operation, had a much different timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a guy who was thinking about doing 440-(yard) repeats two 
months after the operation," says David Keith, Simon's father. "He came home 
from the support group session and said: 'Aw dad, I can't put up with this 
anymore. In all due respect, they're a bunch of old weasels.' " 
</P>
<P>
Witness the weeks following his operation. His brother, Adam, flew overseas to 
spend a few days with him. He expected to find him lying in bed with all kinds 
of tubes in his nose. Instead, a few days after the operation, Simon, weighing 
all of 125 pounds, was wandering the halls, pushing his I.V. stand in front of 
him. The only thing Adam could think to say is "What the hell are you doing?" 
And Simon just told him he was taking a little hike to the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
David even warned Simon's physical therapist in England what she was in for. 
She kept telling him "No, you can't do that." He would go to the surgeon and 
ask, and the surgeon would tell him if he felt he had the strength to do 
something to give it a try. So he would. 
</P>
<P>
"He had (the therapist) reduced to tears," David says. "She had to take a 
holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the operation, Keith was out of the hospital, recuperating in 
an apartment his parents had rented in Cambridge. On one typically wet and 
rainy day, about a month after the operation, Keith was home alone. He figured 
this was as good a time as any to see if he was capable of a jog, so he put his 
shorts on and away he went. 
</P>
<P>
"And I maybe got half a mile," he says. "Maybe. And that was it. I was huffing, 
sure. But I think that was the only time the psychological barrier might have 
gotten in my way. That was the only time." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been the only time in his life that his mind was a roadblock. 
Simon is the first to admit that Adam, who is a year older, was always a much 
better soccer player. Simon drove himself to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
There were the juggling contests in the back yard. The object was to keep the 
ball in the air as many times as you could, hitting it with first the left foot 
and then the right. Adam picked it up the first time and did 300, which Simon 
says showed his unbelievable natural talent. Simon took his turn. He got to 
about 14. 
</P>
<P>
So Simon began coming home every single day after school to practice. Hours and 
hours. And finally, he could do 500. 
</P>
<P>
"And then he'd come back out and do 750," Simon says of Adam. "And he'd never 
pick up a ball again." 
</P>
<P>
But Simon Keith has never been one to get discouraged. A setback is only one if 
you let it set you back. He doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
There is another story that is recalled by his father, a soccer coach who grew 
up in England. When Simon was 17, the coach of the Canadian national team took 
a look at him and told him he was good but not quite good enough. David says 
the coach was concerned that Simon was only 5-feet-7. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, with the same coach watching from the stands, Simon scored the 
tying goal in the championship game for his senior men's team, which went on to 
take the title. To do so, he out-jumped a player who was 6-3 and popped the 
ball in with his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking out," David says, "he made a point of looking at the guy. And I 
couldn't resist saying, 'Not bad for a 5-foot-7 guy who's too small.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe as it may be, Keith treated his heart troubles in about the 
same fashion as any old soccer game. The May before the July operation, a time 
when Keith was going downhill quickly, his best friend, Tak Niketas, went with 
him to the airport on the day he was to fly to London to see a specialist. 
Niketas was worried and was searching for the words to tell Keith how much he 
cared. But Keith was so matter-a-fact about the whole thing that Niketas never 
really said anything. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said 'I'll see you at the end of the summer,' " Niketas 
says. "When he said that, I knew he'd be back." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Keith's biggest concern in all of this was that he wouldn't be 
able to play soccer again. The transplant was his alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"We had tried everything," he said. "If I wanted to play soccer again, this was 
the only hope. It was a very simple equation. I'm sick and I'm going to die, or 
I get a transplant and I can play." 
</P>
<P>
Since the operation, he has had a successful college career at UNLV, where he 
played for three seasons with Adam. Some of the publicity started in college, 
but nothing like he has experienced in the MISL. 
</P>
<P>
First, there were the skeptics who wanted to know how a guy with a heart that 
wasn't even his own could possibly play at the fast pace required to compete in 
indoor soccer. Keith had to convince everybody that he was OK. Doctors. 
Lawyers. Owners. Then, he signed wavers. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? He didn't have anything to lose. His attitude was this: "I'll give 
them anything they want. Just let me play." 
</P>
<P>
He understood their concern. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to invest money in something," he says, "you want to make sure 
you don't have spoiled goods, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I know people within the Crunch organization who are still nervous about me 
being out there." 
</P>
<P>
Not Al Miller, the Crunch's general manager. He opted to make Keith his team's 
top draft choice, the first player chosen in last year's college draft. So if 
Keith is indeed spoiled goods, he has done a nice job disguising it from Kai 
Haaskivi, Cleveland's player-coach. Keith's statistics sheet shows only one 
goal and no assists. But statistics don't always tell much about a player's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got the tools," Haaskivi says. "I think he's got the sharpness. 
He's a good finisher. What he obviously needs to learn is the angles and the 
boards." 
</P>
<P>
Haaskivi isn't going to give him any breaks. Keith is just another one of his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rest of us have pretty much taken the approach that he's really no 
different," Haaskivi says. "He doesn't get any special treatment. I think, at 
times, I maybe push him a little bit more, because he likes to be pushed." 
</P>
<P>
Same as when he mixes it up with his friends on the basketball court. He gets 
his share of pushes and shoves. That's the way he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"We give him a good elbow in the chest where his pacemaker is," Niketas says. 
"We don't treat him any differently." 
</P>
<P>
For Keith, the significance of his heart transplant is nothing more than a 
story to be told over a beer in the bar. He still must take anti-rejection 
drugs, but the greatest risk was in the first year after the operation. It has 
been 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a conversation piece," Adam says. "But that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Keith is realistic, though. He knows the curiosity will always be there. In his 
eyes, it is only an injury that has healed. To others, it is a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm under a microscope," he says. "There's no doubt about it. But I like that, 
because it keeps me doing the right things all the time."

VALLEY TIGHT END OPTS TO PLAY FOR COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sean Brown, a two-year starter at tight end for Valley College and a former 
All-City Section 4-A Division selection at Granada Hills High, has orally 
committed to play football next season at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was an All-Western State Conference selection in his first season at 
Valley but missed six games last season because of a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Granada Hills in 1987, Brown caught 56 passes for 605 yards and 
11 touchdowns in the Highlanders' City championship season. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Granada Hills, Brown received a scholarship offer from 
Arizona State, but he failed to score 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test as is required by the NCAA and enrolled at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 6-foot-3, 235 pounds, was used primarily as a receiver in high school. 
He said playing at Valley helped his development as a run blocker, which will 
be important since Colorado's offense revolves around the ground game. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fun learning to block," Brown said. "Playing (at Valley) made me a more 
complete player." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that he turned down offers to take recruiting trips to Miami, 
Washington, Pittsburgh and Arizona State. The first day players may sign 
national letters of intent is Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he decided not to play for Arizona State next season because his 
priorities have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I wanted to go to ASU because I wanted to play baseball too," said 
Brown, a three-year varsity starter in baseball at Granada Hills. "I want to 
concentrate on football now." 
</P>
<P>
Brown will become the fourth skill-position player from the Granada Hills 
championship team to play Division I football, joining quarterback Jeremy Leach 
(New Mexico), receiver Kyle Jan (Arizona) and running back Jamal Farmer 
(Hawaii).

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: BRANTLEY LEFT MARK IN GRANADA HILLS WIN;

At the time, it was lost in the shuffle, amid the din of victory, the 
backslapping and glad-handing. Three days later, though, when detailed 
post-mortems were conducted, all anybody at Granada Hills High could talk about 
was Jermoine Brantley's surgical touch. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, nearly everyone knew that Brantley, a 5-foot-10 point guard, had scored a 
team-high 21 points in Granada Hills' 88-82 upset of Cleveland on Friday. Yet 
one play in particular still was being dissected Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Cut it out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, man, all everybody's mentioning is the behind-the-back move," a blushing 
Brantley said. "I told them I just used my athletic ability. Shoot, I was 
humble with them. I'm a humble guy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all, 'That was amazing, that was unbelieeeevable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, the use of those superlatives to describe Brantley's play in 
the fourth quarter is no overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
With 4 minutes 55 seconds left and Granada Hills holding a 72-69 lead, Brantley 
was at his quick-handed best -- no mean assertion considering that he finished 
the game with a career-high 17 assists. This time, Brantley completed the job 
himself, with a move straight from the made-for-instant-replay file. 
</P>
<P>
After Pat McCook missed a three-point shot that would have moved Cleveland into 
a tie, Brantley found himself with the ball, sprinting across the halfcourt 
line. Staring him in the eye from the top of the key was Cleveland guard Andre 
Chevalier. At full speed, the left-handed Brantley bore into the paint, juked 
to his left and leaped. 
</P>
<P>
Advisory note for the kids at home: You better have more hang time than a 
Picasso painting to try this one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd gone left a few times and I figured he might think I'd do it again," 
Brantley said of Chevalier, a rather quick character himself. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Brantley brought the ball around his back and laid it over the 
front of the rim with his right hand, all while airborne. The partisan Granada 
Hills crowd went nuts, of course. His coach's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
Much ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he does it all the time," said Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson, who has 
seen Brantley's varsity act three seasons running. "It's a normal move for him. 
The only time he gets in trouble with that is when somebody catches him from 
behind and knocks it away." 
</P>
<P>
In some sports, they'd call Brantley "a closer." When the game is on the on the 
line, Johnson says, Brantley enters Shirley MacLaine territory. Not only is the 
guy having an out-of-body experience, Brantley just might be out of his mind 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he gets a little unconscious," Johnson said. "I really do. I've never 
been able to explain it, something just clicks. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets so intense at certain points in the game, it's crazy. He's always 
focused when we really need it." 
</P>
<P>
Focus on this: After his sleight-of-hand move, Brantley elevated his game 
another notch, scoring eight points in the final 3:10. 
</P>
<P>
"After I scored on Andre, it boosted my confidence," Brantley said. "To take 
one of the best defensive players in the Valley to the hoop gave me a real 
lift." 
</P>
<P>
It was not as uplifting for others, but everyone had to admit that Brantley was 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very impressive," Cleveland Coach Marc Paez said. "He's as quick as 
anybody we've seen in a long while." 
</P>
<P>
Others agreed. When the jumping and shouting ended and the gym had emptied, 
former Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell -- now an assistant at Cal State Long Beach 
-- approached Johnson on the same part of the floor where Brantley tossed in 
his left-right combination to talk about you-know-who's college plans. 
</P>
<P>
Huh? The man who coached Cleveland to the City Section 4-A Division final two 
times in four seasons wants the scoop on the guy who had just sliced Braswell's 
former team to ribbons? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Johnson said, "I guess he's going after the players he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Like Chevalier, maybe Braswell had no choice. Even though Brantley was long 
gone, he had the coach right where he wanted him: standing under the Granada 
Hills basket, trying to figure out what Brantley was going to do next.

CSUN SURPRISES TOP-RANKED USC IN BASEBALL OPENER 
</P>

One down, a season to go. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye toward 1991, when it will move up to Division I, the Cal State 
Northridge baseball team took a giant step toward full-fledged legitimacy 
Tuesday by defeating top-ranked USC, 4-3, at Dedeaux Field in the opener for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive season in which Northridge, ranked seventh in 
Division II, has beaten the Trojans on their home field. Last year, left-hander 
Fili Martinez pitched a four-hitter in a 4-1 CSUN victory. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Vale Lopez and sophomore first baseman Scott Sharts 
provided the key performances for Northridge as the Matadors knocked off the 
11-time national champion Trojans, ranked No. 1 by Baseball America magazine in 
a preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez pitched a complete game, scattering 11 hits, striking out four and 
walking only one. He also helped himself by making the play on two difficult 
bunts that might have swung the momentum to the Trojans' side. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't dwelling on them being No. 1," said Lopez, who was 6-9 with a 4.15 
earned-run average last season. "I was trying to get ahead with my curveball, 
then work my change. They started getting on me so I had to change it around." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, a 6-foot-6, 221-pound right-hand hitter who was the Southern Section 
career home run leader when he played at Simi Valley High, had struck out three 
times against right-handed starter Randy Powers before he blasted a two-run 
homer off left-hander John Cummings in the eighth inning to give Northridge its 
margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been swinging at bad pitches all day," said Sharts, who transferred to 
Northridge last summer from the University of Miami. "They were toying with me, 
throwing balls out of the zone. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cummings) threw me a fastball and that's what I was waiting for the whole 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts was not the only Matador newcomer who contributed to the win. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman catcher Mike Sims had three hits, including a leadoff double in the 
third inning that helped produce the Matadors' first run. Sims moved to third 
when USC catcher Danny Gil threw wildly to first in an effort to get Andy 
Hodgins, who had struck out on a ball in the dirt. Sims then scored when Craig 
Clayton grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Three Northridge freshmen were instrumental in scoring the Matadors' second run 
in the fourth. Designated-hitter Eric Johnson singled with one out, moved to 
second on a sacrifice bunt by second baseman Scott Richardson and came home on 
a single by left fielder Kyle Washington. 
</P>
<P>
USC cut the margin to 2-1 in the fifth on a double by Mark Smith and a 
run-scoring single by Murph Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans went ahead in the sixth on a two-run homer to right by Damon 
Buford. 
</P>
<P>
The one-run lead looked like it would be more than enough for Powers, a senior 
who was selected All-Pacific 10 Conference last season. Powers recorded two 
quick outs in the seventh before Sims and Hodgins reached base on consecutive 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recording a career-high 11 strikeouts, Powers was replaced by Cummings, 
who induced Clayton to foul out to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching change looked like a good move until Sharts belted his 
game-winning homer. 
</P>
<P>
USC threatened in the eighth when Jay Robertson and Jeff Cirillo led off with 
singles. Lopez, however, quashed the rally by fielding a bunt by Sam Vranjes 
and throwing Robertson out at third. He struck out Buford and Billy Morris to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez retired the Trojans in order in the ninth, striking out Bret Boone, USC's 
consensus All-American second baseman, to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Lopez) was sensational," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said.

STATWATCH: ACCURACY AT LINE KEYS BURROUGHS' RISE TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depth, balanced scoring and sure-shot free-throw shooting have vaulted 
Burroughs (6-0) into sole possession of first place in the Foothill League. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians (12-6 overall) have won seven in a row and at least four players 
have scored in double figures in every league game. Six players have scored in 
double figures once and five have scored in double figures twice. 
</P>
<P>
In an 82-68 victory over Hart on Friday, Burroughs made 19 of 24 free throws. 
The previous week, the Indians made 25 of 28 from the line in an 80-70 victory 
over second-place Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Burroughs has made 92 of 131 free throws (70%) in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Royal's Russell Myers, a 6-foot-5 senior, has become the first player 
in school history to score 1,000 points. Myers, who holds almost every school 
scoring record, has 1,073 points during a four-year career. Myers is on the 
brink of eclipsing Andy Jercha's single-season scoring record of 487 points set 
in 1983-84 . Myers has 437 points in 18 games, an average of 24.3. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park's Marcus Reed, a senior guard who is averaging 20.4 points a game 
in Northwest Valley Conference play, has scored 20 points or more in 11 of 18 
games. . . . Grant's Rene de la Hoya is shooting 65% from the field, having 
made 98 of 150 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura scored 58 second-half points during its 90-55 win over Santa Paula on 
Friday. The Chargers, who led at halftime, 32-31, scored 34 points in the third 
quarter. . . . Guard James Chen handed out 29 assists in two Reseda wins last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Winning ways: With its recent 65-62 victory over Arcadia in a Pacific League 
game, Crescenta Valley has virtually assured itself of its 27th winning record 
in 28 seasons. Under Coach John Goffredo, the Falcons (12-8, 4-2) have made the 
Southern Section playoffs 10 of 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Undersized: Channel Islands has no player taller than 6-foot-3, and that has 
hurt the Raiders more than once this season. Newbury Park's Kevin Loveall, a 
6-8 senior, was the latest Marmonte League center to benefit from the Raiders' 
lack of height. Loveall made 11 of 15 field-goal attempts and had season highs 
of 27 points and 17 rebounds against Channel Islands last week. Westlake's B. 
J. Sena and John Van Spyk, a pair of 6-6 inside players, combined to hit 22 of 
29 shots and score 52 points against the Raiders on Jan. 19.

YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE PROBLEMATIC FOR CITY SECTION PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal that would place all schools in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District on a year-round calendar could wreak havoc with high school athletics 
schedules, according to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education will consider Monday an overcrowding relief plan that 
was proposed by Supt. Leonard Britton at last Monday's meeting. Under the plan, 
which would take effect in 1991, schools would operate on the "90/30" calendar 
that puts students in school for three months -- or 90 days -- then on vacation 
for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also lays the groundwork for the district to adopt a multi-track, 
year-round operation, which is inevitable, according to Britton. A multi-track 
plan divides the student body into groups and creates more classroom space 
because one group of students is on vacation at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But because not all schools face immediate overcrowding conditions -- 
particularly high schools in the Valley -- schools would be allowed to start 
the program on a single-track calendar with all students operating on the same 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness emphasized that the needs of athletics pale in comparison to the 
concerns that overcrowding presents to the district. He also said that it is 
too soon to draw contingency plans, citing the possibility that the measure 
might not gain board approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Harkness claimed that a single-track calendar that calls for two monthlong 
vacations -- one in the summer and the other during the traditional school year 
-- could disrupt high school athletics schedules. The closure of a school 
during a sports season could present logistical problems of nightmarish 
proportions, Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
"When a school is closed, there are no students, coaches, teachers, 
administrators, support staff, there is no one there," Harkness said. "The 
place is dark. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer, when you don't have any programs, there's no problem, but 
when you have programs, that's a calamity." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Bell, Belmont, Huntington Park and South Gate follow a year-round 
calendar under a three-track system in which two-thirds of the student body is 
always in school. A student must attend practices and games while on vacation 
if the vacation coincides with the season of a sport he or she wants to play. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness claims that the system works well at those schools, saying the only 
significant consequence is the phasing out of two-sport coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to coach a sport in the fall and the spring, there's no way you're 
not going to put some off-track time in," he said.

If Harvard High were to play all of its basketball games in a vacuum, Coach 
Greg Hilliard might be the last to gripe. Reputation, Hilliard says, can be 
detrimental. 
</P>
<P>
The notion, therefore, that the Saracens took a step closer to legitimacy 
Tuesday with their 71-60 victory over Notre Dame is somewhat unsettling to 
Hilliard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to get recognition," he said. "But there's something to be said for 
that unknown quality. Every time we show up, people think, 'I don't know if 
they're for real yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Count Notre Dame among the believers. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place Knights (10-10 overall, 4-3 in San Fernando Valley League 
play) were in position to shave Harvard's commanding lead in the league 
standings. Instead, they saw the Saracens (18-2, 7-0) run their winning streak 
to 11 games and assure themselves of at least a share of the league title. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say Notre Dame was passive in defeat. The Knights surged twice 
in the second half but were unable to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
With three minutes left, Notre Dame's Bobby DaCorsi made a free throw to trim 
the deficit to 60-55. Earlier in the fourth period, he scored on consecutive 
layups to bring the Knights within seven. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard, using an uncharacteristically deliberate approach, pulled away in the 
stretch with an 11-3 rally that included a decisive three-point basket by guard 
Rick Osterloh. 
</P>
<P>
Osterloh's spirit-snapping basket came with 1 minute 49 seconds to play and 
gave Harvard a 67-57 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Osterloh, who sat out the first meeting between the teams because of the flu, 
paced the Saracens with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
DaCorsi, a junior, scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, both game highs, 
for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame trailed, 38-28, at intermission but trimmed the deficit to a point 
less than three minutes into the third period. DaCorsi scored six points and 
teammate Steve Colella made a layup and a pair of 17-foot jump shots to pare 
Harvard's lead to 43-42. The Saracens answered with a 12-4 run to finish the 
quarter.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CLARK GETS ONE RECORD, AIMS FOR SOME MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian's Tony Clark broke another scoring record Friday, and if he continues 
as he has (he is averaging 43 points a game), he might break a couple more by 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Clark scored 58 points in Christian's 88-52 victory over Clairemont and by 
doing so reached 1,987 points, breaking the San Diego Section record for career 
scoring. Paul Halupa of Bonita Vista scored 1,982 from 1968-70. 
</P>
<P>
The 58 points were the third most scored in a county game. Madison's Mitchell 
Lilly scored 61 against San Diego in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Another record well within Clark's range is points in a single season. He has 
777 in 18 games and a minimum of six games remaining (five league and at least 
one in the playoffs), barring injury. Maintaining his 43-point average would 
give him 1,035 after 24 games, easily beating the record of 960 in 33 games set 
by Helix's Bill Walton in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Valhalla, Clark scored 847 points in 28 games to rank fourth 
behind Walton's record. 
</P>
<P>
The Clairemont girls' basketball team is undergoing yet another coaching change 
following David Watson's departure Monday. Watson, a former assistant, had 
taken over when Ken Grainger was fired Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Watson will be on-site aide Lamont Jackson. Jackson, a former 
Clairemont athlete, will coach on an interim basis for the remainder of the 
season, after which a new coach will be hired. Jackson will have to be teamed 
with a certified teacher, Vice Principal Peter Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Watson is leaving because he will begin full-time teaching at 
Kearny on Monday. Watson had been part-time at Kearny, giving him time to coach 
at Clairemont, but had said he would eventually have to give up the Clairemont 
position if his teaching hours increased. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my decision that he would leave now," Schroeder said. "It is a good 
time since we are between the first and second round of the (league) basketball 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines hopes to attract some of the country's best high school basketball 
teams when it plays host to the San Diego Above the Rim Holiday tournament next 
Dec. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-team tournament will begin at Torrey Pines and conclude at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top-ranked schools that may attend are Mater Dei (Santa Ana), St. 
Anthony's (N.J.) and Miami (Fla.) High. Torrey Pines and three other county 
schools (to be named) will also play. 
</P>
<P>
Having no gym and being forced to practice outside hasn't hampered the Our Lady 
of Peace girls' basketball team. The No. 9 Pilots (16-3, 4-0) defeated 
Christian, 49-38, Tuesday to break a tie with Christian for first place in the 
City Harbor League. 
</P>
<P>
OLP plays home games at St. Augustine but never really feels a home-court 
advantage, Coach Yvonne Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough driving all over, and it takes its toll on the girls," Sanchez 
said. "We had a game all the way out at Valhalla that was tough, and we 
couldn't schedule a home game with them." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said she cringed during the recent rains, although the team was able to 
practice at St. Michael's School in Poway on a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Tavares leads OLP by averaging 18.4 points per game, ninth in the county 
in scoring. April Velk is averaging 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
After a fourth-place finish in the Palomar League last season, the Mt. Carmel 
girls' soccer team has shut out 12 opponents this season and is second in the 
league behind Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (15-0-3, 6-0-2) tied Poway, 1-1, in last year's section 3-A final 
to share the title. Mt. Carmel (12-4-1, 5-2-1) has already broken its school 
record of eight shutouts in a season set in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Senior goalkeeper Heather Petterson is Mt. Carmel's only four-year varsity 
player. She started on the freshman team, but when Coach Jim Dutton needed a 
replacement on the varsity, she was moved up. In her first varsity game, Mt. 
Carmel tied Poway, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Petterson broke her thumb in the second league game her sophomore year and 
missed most of the rest of the season. But since then, she has been a constant 
force for Mt. Carmel with 27 career shutouts, 11 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She has great defense in front of her," Dutton said. "She does an excellent 
job of taking control." 
</P>
<P>
Petterson is backed by senior Michelle Daigle, called by Dutton "the best 
backup goalkeeper in San Diego". 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Leigh Anne Baker leads Mt. Carmel in scoring with 12 goals this 
season -- she had three in a 5-0 victory over Vista last week -- and has six 
assists. She had 35 goals on the freshman team last year. Jan Dolloff, also a 
sophomore forward, has six assists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're peaking when we need to," Dutton said. "We're reducing mistakes and 
playing smarter ball. We want to play 80 minutes of good soccer and more team 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel's senior midfielders have been with the program since they were 
freshmen -- Theresa Miranda, Kim Franzen, Christine Phillips and Jennifer 
Timms.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: FIVE SOCKERS NAMED TO MISL ALL-STAR TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Sockers -- midfielders Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, defenders Kevin Crow 
and George Fernandez and forward Zoran Karic -- have been selected to the 
Western Division team that will be coached by the Sockers' Ron Newman in the 
Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star Game Feb. 21 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, a six-time selection, has been the MISL's defender of the year three 
times. Fernandez, a first-time selection, has played in 105 consecutive games. 
Segota, making his eighth appearance, leads the Sockers in scoring with 14 
goals and 20 assists. Karic, a first-time selection, is second on the team with 
24 points. Quinn, a six-time selection, is the Sockers' playmaker and has eight 
goals and 15 assists in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Also selected was St. Louis' Fernando Clavijo, a defender who played for the 
Sockers from 1984-88. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State has received oral commitments from Tim Gutierrez, a 6-foot-3, 
200-pound quarterback from Santa Clara High School, and Marc Ziegler, a 6-4, 
215-pound tight end from Mira Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez finished his three-year high school career with 7,272 yards passing, 
third best all time in the Southern Section, fifth in the state and ninth 
nationally. He completed 210 of 334 passes for 2,939 yards (fourth in the 
state) and 18 touchdowns last season. Gutierrez hasn't yet qualified to play at 
SDSU because he hasn't passed the Scholastic Aptitude Test. If his score isn't 
high enough, he said he will likely enroll at a community college in the Oxnard 
area and then transfer to SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez was also recruited by New Mexico and Cal State Fullerton. He said he 
chose SDSU because of its pass-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type of offense I eventually want to go in and run," he said. "And 
San Diego State's program is rising." 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler joins Mira Mesa teammate J.J. Rowlett as having committed to SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"Marc is a great athlete," Mira Mesa Coach Brad Griffith said. "He's going to 
have to do a little weight work to get a bigger upper body, but he's got great 
hands, and he can really be a factor in their program." 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage used a school-record 14 three-pointers to defeat host The 
Master's, 86-80, in a nonconference game in Newhall. The victory was a 
school-record ninth in a row for CHC. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, ranked No. 1 in the National Christian College Athletic Assn., 
trailed, 68-63, with 5:45 remaining. But CHC then hit three consecutive 
three-pointers to take a 72-70 lead and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Soucie and Will Cunningham each had six three-pointers. Soucie finished 
with 26 points, Cunningham 23 and Mark Kraatz 16 for CHC (18-4). 
</P>
<P>
Warren Daniels made a pair of free throws with six seconds left to lift Cal 
Baptist over Point Loma Nazarene, 76-75, in a Golden State Athletic Conference 
game in Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's Gary Litten got off a last-second shot but missed. PLNC is 6-15, 0-6, 
Cal Baptist 8-10, 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders were led by Mike Flores with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Ron 
Hubbard and Brian Thurston added 16 points. Daniels led the Lancers with 25 
points. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College's James Cass allowed just two runs on five hits over seven 
innings to beat U.S. International, 12-2, in the Gulls' season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Crabtree had a home run for USIU. Mike Whisonant was the loser, allowing 
six runs in four-plus innings. Chapman, which got homers from Doug Yates, Tom 
Allison and Mark Landeros, improved to 2-0. SCOTT MILLER

JACK SMITH: INTERNATIONAL SIGNAL CODE SALUTES CHANGING TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My old colleague Ray Hebert, former urban affairs writer of The Times, has 
retired to Carlsbad, where he evidently has time to think about changes that 
have taken place since his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Recently Ray and his wife, Joan, took a trip up the coast to Astoria, Ore., 
where they visited the Columbia River Maritime Museum. As a one-time merchant 
seaman, Ray was pleased to find in the museum almost everything one might want 
to know about the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But he found that there have been changes he considers shocking, or at best 
incomprehensible, in the international signal code alphabet. That is a matter 
of esoteric interest, I concede, but knowing that I was also in the merchant 
marine, he asked for my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that some of the changes Hebert notes are a part of the general 
deterioration of the language in this technological age. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be less and less respect for the simple words that used to do so 
much work. For example, effect is no longer effective; the new word is impact. 
</P>
<P>
Hebert reports that the new code words for signal flags and letters of the 
alphabet are Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, 
Juliet, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, 
Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-Ray, Yankee and Zulu. 
</P>
<P>
Checking the "American Merchant Seaman's Manual" issued to him in April, 1942, 
he found that the code words then were Affirm, Baker, Cast, Dog, Easy, Fox, 
George, Hypo, Interrogatory, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Negative, Option, 
Preparatory, Queen, Roger, Sail, Tare, Unit, Victor, William, X-Ray, Yoke and 
Zed. 
</P>
<P>
Hebert notes, in bafflement, that only three words have survived intact -- 
Mike, Victor and X-Ray. "I was fascinated," he says. "What line of thinking led 
to changing Roger to Romeo, and what possessed them to drop Love in favor of 
Lima or Queen for Quebec? (And why does) the Fox flag unaccountably become 
Foxtrot?" 
</P>
<P>
Although I cannot understand half-billion-dollar bombers and other military 
extravagances, I will try to comprehend the Pentagon's whimsy at the simple 
level of word use. 
</P>
<P>
I do think Charlie is an improvement over Cast; but Delta is no improvement 
over Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we used Dog when I was in the Marine Corps, back in 1943. Dog was 
unmistakable. ("Dog to Easy. This is Dog calling Easy. Come in Easy." What 
could be simpler?) But perhaps November was substituted for Negative because 
Negative might be mistaken for a message, meaning "no" or "none." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Roger may have given way to Romeo because Roger also has a meaning of 
its own, apart from being the code word for R. I grant that Zulu is more 
recognizable than Zed, but why Sierra over Sail, why Hotel over Hypo, Echo over 
Easy, Lima over Love, Kilo over King? 
</P>
<P>
I agree that Oscar is better than Option and India is better than Interrogatory 
(but why not Ink?), but how does Bravo improve on Baker? 
</P>
<P>
OK, Whiskey is better than William, and Tango is certainly better than Tare, 
whatever that meant. And Yankee is better than Yoke. But why Golf instead of 
George? 
</P>
<P>
There may be a clue in the fact that all the new words (except Golf and Mike) 
are at least two syllables, replacing such one-syllable words as Cast, Dog, 
Fox, Jig, King, Love, Queen, Sail, Yoke and Zed. Is a two-syllable word less 
likely to be misunderstood? 
</P>
<P>
Most of us will never have to worry about these codes. But it makes me 
uncomfortable to think that the U.S. Navy is tampering with its hallowed 
traditions for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy, tradition is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Marine Corps and talked to a Gunnery Sgt. Hill. I asked him if he 
could find out the current signal code words. "Know 'em," he said. He read them 
off without hesitation -- "Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta . . . " -- right down 
the line, the new list as reported by Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a remarkable memory," I said. "Never forget 'em," he said. "In boot 
camp, we had to chant those words, over and over, on a 17-mile march." 
</P>
<P>
From another noncommissioned officer I learned that the Corps changed its 
system from the old "Baker, Dog, Easy" during or after the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, boot camp hasn't changed much.

* Dulled Repute: Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) wants to rename Dulles International 
Airport to honor President Dwight D. Eisenhower, stripping the accolade from 
Ike's controversial Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. Dulles is 
remembered as the force behind the now-discredited "brinkmanship" policies and 
of the "domino theory." 
</P>
<P>
But the plan dismays Dulles' grandson and namesake, John Foster Dulles: "It is 
most appropriate that we honor President Eisenhower. . . . However, it would 
certainly not be in keeping with his desires that the tribute, which he 
accorded my grandfather, be taken away in this manner." 
</P>
<P>
* Devoted Duos: What do President George and First Lady Barbara Bush have in

* Sex After 50?: As they approach their 50th birthdays, newsmen Ted Koppel and 
Tom Brokaw talked about the news business. NBC's Brokaw was born on Feb. 6, 
1940, ABC's Koppel Feb. 8. Koppel said in the Feb. 3 TV Guide he believes Peter 
Jennings, Dan Rather and Brokaw "have a level of sex appeal that I don't have." 
But said Brokaw of his work: "I don't think I'll be here for another 15 years."

* New Heights: Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympics star gymnast, says children 
without goals are more likely to get involved with drugs, including alcohol. 
"You have to be willing to make sacrifices," she told a group of students in 
Huntington, W. Va. "There will be a lot of hard choices." Retton retired from 
gymnastics four years ago. "It was time for new goals, like getting a good 
education," she said.

EDUCATION: AN EL MONTE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIXES LITERATURE AND A SLUMBER PARTY 
WITH EYE-OPENING RESULTS.

Gerardo Hernandez, 8, showed up at the school cafeteria with sleeping bag in 
hand and agenda all mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
"We get to see movies, read stories and stay up as long as we want," he 
explained. "I brought my pillow so when the lights go out I can start a pillow 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez and about 80 of his classmates at Potrero Elementary School in El 
Monte spent Friday night at the school's second annual slumberless slumber 
party. But, despite Hernandez's plans, the idea wasn't for the children to hit 
each other with pillows. It was for them to hit the books. 
</P>
<P>
Cuddled together, with only one flashlight between them, 10-year- old 
Concepcion Maldonado read Leo Lionna's "Alexander &amp; The Wind-up Mouse" to 
her friend Claudia Caloca, two years her junior. "I'm a good reader," Maldonado 
said. "I always go to (Claudia's) house and help her so she can learn her 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Suzette Johnston said the late-night outing was new for many of the 
children, and it took some convincing before parents agreed to let them attend 
the school-sponsored event. She said that because many of the students come 
from highly protective immigrant families, she spent hours on the telephone 
giving assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of calls from mothers saying their children really wanted to go," 
Johnston said. "They said it was OK with them, but that the fathers said no. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are more cautious about letting their kids spend the night out these 
days," she added, alluding to fears about gangs in the San Gabriel Valley 
community where the school is located. "We had to convince them that this was a 
safe environment for their kids to do something special." 
</P>
<P>
Still, for some children, spending the night away from home was a little scary. 
</P>
<P>
Karla Castillo, 8, whose dad usually tucks her in and reads her a story, 
sheepishly brought her bunny, "Boo Boo," with her to the sleep-over party. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't sleep without him," Castillo said of the threadbare stuffed animal. "I 
thought kids would make fun of me because I sleep with a bunny. But then I saw 
they had toys to sleep with, too." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the children were more than a little excited to spend the night away 
from siblings and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to take a shower," said Michael Martinez, 8, as he ticked off the 
advantages of a night away from home. "I get to stay up as late as I want . . . 
and get silly." 
</P>
<P>
His pal Michael Herrera agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get wild when the lights go out," Herrera promised. "I don't have 
to listen to my parents or clean my room. This is a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
For Luis Ramirez, 9, an evening of nonstop eating was his idea of paradise. 
There was pizza, popcorn, cupcakes, Kool-Aid, cookies and milk at midnight, and 
then pancakes for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"They eat so much that by the time they get to the end, they don't want any 
more," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the night, though, was designed to give the youngsters a little food 
for thought. They watched movies based on storybook classics, including "A 
Cricket in Times Square," "Charlotte's Web," "The Velveteen Rabbit" and "Where 
the Wild Things Are." 
</P>
<P>
There also were reading circles. Wearing a T-shirt proclaiming, "If You Love 
Me, Read Me A Story," teacher Janet Lloyd kept one small group of youngsters 
enthralled with an ebullient rendition of "Cowardly Clyde," a yarn about a 
horse that is scared by a giant monster. 
</P>
<P>
Said pupil Mariza Ramirez: "Sometimes it's boring to read, but I like it when 
the teacher reads." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their best-laid plans for pulling an all-nighter, half the students 
tuckered out by 2:30 a.m. -- and only six actually hung in long enough to see 
the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Little boys were making bets," Johnston said. "But usually the ones who talk 
the loudest are the ones who fall asleep first." 
</P>
<P>
Before they closed their eyes, though, many of the children seemed to get the 
reading message. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reading under the covers with my flashlight," said Michael Cobo, 8, as 
he waited for his mother to pick him up Saturday morning. "When I grow up I'm 
going to read a lot. Because if I don't know how to read, trouble will come to 
me."

EXHIBIT DEPICTS HOW FAIR, BALBOA PARK ALTERED CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 75 years ago, a stone-faced San Diego businessman convinced the Chamber 
of Commerce that the city could improve its tepid economy by staging a world 
fair on an arid piece of chaparral known as Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The plan worked. Not only did the 1915 California-Panama Exposition result in 
bringing more business and more people to San Diego, it started traditions that 
became synonymous with the city. The Navy, Spanish-Colonial architecture, the 
zoo, eucalyptus trees and even San Diego's pigeon population owe their origins 
here to the 1915 world fair. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the impact the exposition had on the city, the staff of the San 
Diego Historical Society at the Museum of San Diego History has created "Come 
to the Fair," an exhibit featuring photographs, souvenirs, costumes, movies and 
other artifacts from the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is part of a extravaganza throughout Balboa Park this year in honor 
of its 75th anniversary. Balboa Park is the second-largest urban park in 
America, behind only Central Park in New York. 
</P>
<P>
When she began researching "Come to the Fair" about a year ago, society 
Associate Director Ann Kantor said she wanted to show San Diegans "what a 
tremendous impact the 1915 expo had on the future of San Diego," and how it 
affected the growth of Balboa Park itself. 
</P>
<P>
By spending $2 million to build a "Magic City" on 42 acres above downtown, the 
city was able to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors, including 
influential politicians and businessmen who saw San Diego's natural harbor. 
Soon after the exposition closed, the Navy claimed San Diego as a base and the 
city began to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"The only growth issue we had in San Diego at that time is that it wasn't 
growing fast enough," Kantor said. The city fathers "felt they had to promote 
the city so industry would pick up." 
</P>
<P>
With the Panama Canal set to open in 1915, San Diego would become the first 
port north of the canal. G. Aubrey Davidson, the serious-looking businessman 
and banker, proposed taking advantage of the canal opening to advertise the 
city's attractions and finally "put San Diego on the map." 
</P>
<P>
The exposition may have grown from serious ideals, but the event itself was 
pure fun. The historical society's exhibit takes full advantage of the latter, 
greeting visitors with a large statue of a nude woman that adorned one of the 
buildings designed and built especially for the expo. Many similar statues can 
still be seen throughout the park. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings themselves, along El Prado and throughout the park, imitated 
Spanish Colonial architecture. Kantor said it was the first time any city in 
Southern California had capitalized on the Spanish and Mexican heritage of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"The city was really changed by this type of architecture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the old photographs Kantor had reproduced for the exhibit show how the 
style spread through the city, including downtown's magnificent Spanish-style 
Santa Fe Railroad station, which is still used today. 
</P>
<P>
Horticulturists spent a year landscaping the park for the fair. They brought in 
hundreds of plants that were not native to San Diego County, including the now 
familiar eucalyptus tree. Pigeons were also imported, and became one of the 
most popular attractions at the fair, Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny menagerie in the park -- including a tiger, lion and bear -- formed the 
nucleus for the San Diego Zoo after the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings erected for the fair were to have been torn down when it 
closed, but city voters passed a bond issue to save Balboa Park. One section 
that didn't survive, however, was the "Fun Zone," a midway of fun houses and 
exhibits including an ostrich farm, a trained-steer show and a Lipton Tea 
plantation where tea was grown, harvested and served to expo visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to "Come to the Fair," can also see two silent movies about the fair, 
both made on site during its two-year run which began Jan. 1, 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come to the Fair," is open Wednesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m., through May 6. Admission is $2 for adults; children 12 and under, and 
museum members are admitted free.

LITA ALBUQUERQUE AND HER SEARCH FOR UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born in Santa Monica, artist Lita Albuquerque split her childhood years between 
a Tunisian fishing village, a Catholic convent in Carthage, and Paris. 
Albuquerque's family splintered when she was quite young, and this no doubt 
played a role in launching her on the quest for unity that is central to her 
art. 
</P>
<P>
And Albuquerque has been on quite a quest indeed. She has traveled the globe 
and made pilgrimages to sacred sites around the world -- her art, in fact, 
takes as primary inspiration the landscapes of the Yucatan, Egypt and the 
Arizona desert. In the course of her travels she has met Frank Lloyd Wright and 
Duchamp; she has familiarized herself with Zen, meditation, yoga, Tantric art, 
the occult, Jung and Madame Blavatsky. She has learned to sky dive, and has 
been profoundly affected by the experience of being rolfed. In short, 
Albuquerque is a pedigreed New Age girl, and her artworks are essentially 
souvenirs of her journeys, both in the physical world, and in search of the 
inner reaches of her soul. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of "Lita Albuquerque: Reflections," a retrospective exhibition on 
view at the Santa Monica Museum of Art through April 1, Albuquerque has 
produced a staggering amount of work, and the generous sampling included here 
is but a fraction of her output, which also includes stage sets, public arts 
projects, and earthworks. Curated by Henry Hopkins, this exquisitely installed 
show focuses on Albuquerque's studio work -- paintings, sculptures, 
installations and drawings -- of the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging Robert Irwin, James Turrell and Eric Orr as major influences, 
Albuquerque is essentially a second-generation California light-and-space 
artist, and as such, her central themes are metaphysical phenomena, perception, 
and of course, light and space. In exploring her themes -- which often boil 
down to the interchangeability of the microcosm and the macrocosm -- she 
frequently turns to ideas rooted in geometry and astronomy, and her work has a 
quasi-scientific air. One could make the case that Georgia O'Keeffe also played 
a role in forging the road Albuquerque travels; like O'Keeffe, Albuquerque (who 
describes herself as being "very involved in power spots"), is drawn to 
dramatic landscapes which she interprets as vehicles for transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Albuquerque's work underwent a major shift, moving from pure 
abstraction to a mixed-media style designed to address man's relationship to 
his environment (she describes the style she developed as "alchemical abstract 
art"). At this point the horizon line became a dominant motif for Albuquerque 
and she became fascinated by the notion that a cross is formed by the 
juxtaposition of the vertical human body and the horizon line. This seems a 
less than earth-shattering observation, but it nonetheless led Albuquerque to 
deduce that symbols are created through man's interrelationship with nature -- 
an idea that pops up throughout the show. 
</P>
<P>
In developing this theme she began executing what she refers to as ephemeral 
pieces; temporary earthworks involving patterns of intensely colored pigment 
applied to the surface of the earth. She made pieces in dry lake beds, and used 
red pigment to outline the shadow cast by the Washington Monument. Her 
ephemeral works, which are designed to be short lived, are represented by a 
series of large color photographs documenting works from 1978-83. 
</P>
<P>
Other works find Albuquerque likening the iris of a human eye to a planet half 
in darkness and half in light, while a series of nine works on paper, 
"Earth/Sun/Moon," was inspired by gazing at the moon through high-powered 
binoculars for a period of two years. The centerpiece of the exhibition is 
"Reflection," a massive obelisk made of gold-leafed aluminum, poised on a 
circular reflective disk. An inscrutable form evocative of both the Tower of 
Babel and a lightning rod, "Reflection" is your basic spiritual growth tool; 
you get from it what you put into it. 
</P>
<P>
The materials Albuquerque favors are as dazzling as her themes; glittering 
metals (copper and gold leaf primarily), luxurious shades of deep red, blue and 
purple, and large, imposing shapes. Albuquerque also writes and often combines 
original text (cosmic fables of creation) with related imagery. Several works 
of this style are included here. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, Albuquerque's work is physically stunning. At its worst, it seems 
not nearly as rigorous as the subject at hand demands, and a trifle facile. 
Gold leaf, for instance, is a little too easy; you could slather this stuff on 
an old shoe and transform it into a magical talisman. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, though noble in intention, Albuquerque's metaphysics occasionally 
strike one as a bit simplistic. She fails to address the human foibles -- 
anger, greed, fear -- that stand as the chief obstacles to spiritual 
transcendence. Sad to say, neither a good pair of binoculars nor a sparkling 
painting of the heavens can bring about genuine vision.

SPECTOR EXHIBIT AT NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM AN OPEN BOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
Using books as his principal material, Buzz Spector makes sculpture that is 
quiet, unassuming and ruminative in the extreme. The experience of looking at a 
small exhibition of his work at the Newport Harbor Art Museum through March 18 
is akin to the half-searching, half-idle experience of rummaging through a 
neighborhood bookstore -- but with a telling difference. Carved, torn, stacked, 
boxed, framed, painted over and, in a few cases, converted into pedestals, his 
books cannot be read. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest work in the show, which was organized by associate curator Lucinda 
Barnes as part of the museum's ongoing New California Artist series, 
establishes the parameters for the artist's subsequent endeavors. "Evolution of 
a Life" (1981) is pointedly made from a used book of undetermined title, author 
and origin. Its first page has been torn out, close to the binding, and 
discarded; the second page has likewise been torn out, albeit slightly further 
from the binding. This procedure is repeated for each subsequent page, the 
sheets getting progressively larger as the book's hidden narrative unfolds, 
until the very last page, which remains intact and whole. 
</P>
<P>
The typically linear sequence of pages is deftly transformed into an evocation 
of a conscious life. Laying open in a display case, the book's sequentially 
torn pages form a paper wedge whose white surface is peppered with an abstract 
scatter of typographic fragments of words and letters. In the "Evolution of a 
Life," the beginning has vanished and cannot be recalled. The end, however, is 
whole, its text presumably full; yet, the denouement remains impossibly 
obscured behind the pileup of intervening leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, you "read" this book by not being able to read it at all. This 
particular life may be an open book, but it's no less mysterious for it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the material he employs, it would be a mistake to regard Spector's work 
within the genre called artists' books. Instead, he converts books into 
sculptural objects, or else he incorporates them into larger sculptural 
ensembles. The distinction, which claims the poetic work of the late Belgian 
conceptual artist Marcel Broodthaers as one obvious precedent and the slightly 
altered objects of Marcel Duchamp as another, is important. In Spector's 
sculptures, the common relationship between a reader and a book gets upended. 
</P>
<P>
A book is an intimate thing, meant to be held, even cradled while its meanings 
are revealed. A sculpture, by contrast, is typically untouchable, or distanced 
by its display inside a protective case or on a pedestal. By making books into 
sculptures, and in a few cases into pedestals on which other objects sit, 
Spector opens up a surprisingly wide range of conflicting responses: A spectrum 
from desire to frustration frames the experience of his work. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes 16 altered books and three mixed-media sculptures. In 
choosing his particular material, Spector has provocatively framed books as the 
principal intersection attempt to discover a rhyme or reason to the order of 
the stacked books -- some secretly manufactured, faux Dewey-decimal system of 
subject, author, genre, date or even the color of the covers -- seems doomed to 
failure. The only apparent quality all these books share is that the artist 
chose them, while their individual placement in the whole seems determined 
according to pragmatic fit. The sculpture, which is dated 1984-90, always 
remains the same, even though it changes utterly every time it is installed. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons of sheer visibility, however, books on the top layer gain a certain 
stature over those hidden within the stacks (Philip Roth's "Goodbye Columbus" 
assumes an added prominence, simply because it turns up twice). Meanwhile, 
those whose spines are visible on the face of each "step" form a kind of middle 
class of volumes. Despite the random order, the urge to find -- to impose -- 
some hierarchy or system of value remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
If Spector's art is typically unassuming, and if it sometimes teeters on the 
brink of collapsing into a solipsistic game, it nonetheless finds a certain 
solace in the gentle pleasure of its artistic endeavor. As your mind busies 
itself establishing an ever-more elaborate network of relationships, 
effortlessly careening "Toward a Theory of Universal Causality," the sheer 
arbitrariness of the enterprise looms as its most surprisingly luxurious -- and 
liberating -- attribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructions by Buzz Spector are on view through March 18 at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $1 to $3. Information: (714)

Soul Train Hosts: Luther Vandross will join Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle as

ALBUM DEBUT IMPRESSIVE BY STEVIE SALAS COLORCODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Island Records has just released the debut album by Stevie Salas ColorCode, the 
rock 'n' roll power trio fronted by the Oceanside native. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the album, the 26-year-old guitarist and cohorts C.J. deVillar on 
bass and Winston A. Watson on drums just might steal the show from Joe 
Satriani, for whom they're opening Saturday and Sunday at the California 
Theater downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just an impressive debut, but an impressive album, period. The 10 
songs, all either written or co-written by Salas, are rooted in gut-smacking 
hard rock (borderline heavy metal), but steeped in sweltering funk. This isn't 
really surprising, given that two of the first people Salas worked with after 
moving to Los Angeles in 1985 -- he spent the first half of the decade plying 
the North County bar scene with This Kid's -- were George Clinton and Bootsy 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, in fact, contributes a brief "long-distance telerap" to "Two Bullets 
and a Gun," one of the album's standout tracks. The ingredients are all there: 
a catchy melody, a ferocious beat, and Salas' delirious guitar pyrotechnics. 
Other songs on which Salas' fingers do exceptionally fine gymnastics on the 
frets are the funky, Living Colour-ish "Stand Up!" and "The Harder They Come," 
reminiscent of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way." 
</P>
<P>
That Salas is an incredible guitarist is old news. After all, he spent nearly 
two years on the road with Rod Stewart, playing the immortal licks, riffs, 
solos, and fills originally laid down by Jeff Beck and Ronnie Wood. 
</P>
<P>
The new news is that Salas is also a pretty amazing singer (all the other stuff 
he's done, both on the road and in the studio, involved only his guitar). Salas 
is certainly not your typical androgynous-sounding hard-rock shrieker; his 
voice is rangy and resonant. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed -- he's a veritable vocal chameleon, sounding, at times, like Prince 
("Just Like That"), the late Jimi Hendrix ("Indian Chief"), and even Joe Cocker 
("Over and Over Again"). 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diego acts have been signed to major labels in the last few years, but 
very few have actually succeeded in making a national name for themselves. 
Salas certainly has the talent and the credits to be in this elite minority. 
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Stage Company downtown is now featuring live music every 
Tuesday night. Rick Saxton and partner Rob Flury, working together as Uncle 
Mother Productions, are producing concerts featuring local, original-music acts 
you're not likely to see anywhere else in town. 
</P>
<P>
Past performers include progressive funk-rock band Daddy Longlegs, veteran folk 
singer Sam Hinton, acoustic folk-and-comedy duo the Rugburns, and topical 
singer-songwriter Deborah Liv Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd play the bars if they could, but the bar scene revolves around Top 40 
and discos where people don't come out to hear music, but to have a social 
scene," Saxton said. "Here, the music comes first -- no one's worried about 
booze sales or picking up on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, the Progressive Stage Company -- at 433 G St. -- holds 
just 50 people and doesn't have a liquor license. The cover charge is $5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a concert scene," Saxton said. "The atmosphere we're trying to 
create is completely different than Diego's." 
</P>
<P>
Saxton and Flury initially began producing original-music concerts together 
last summer, at the weekly Underground at the Lyceum in Horton Plaza. Last 
November, they were hired to produce the Progressive Stage Company's Homegrown 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We did all sorts of theater pieces and concerts, and when the festival ended, 
we were asked to continue doing the Tuesday night concerts," Saxton said. 
</P>
<P>
"And the response has been really good, both from the musicians and from the 
crowds. There's so much great talent in San Diego, particularly from the 
songwriter angle, that gets too little exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Progressive Stage Company will host a double bill: Latin-folk band 
Kumara, from Tijuana, and the Transylvania String Quartet, which plays ethnic 
folk music from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego ticket brokers continue to accept "deposits" on choice 
seats for upcoming local concerts that have yet to be booked, much less 
announced -- more than likely, to improve their cash flow. Among the 
speculative shows they advertised in last Thursday's Reader are might-happen, 
might-not-happen appearances by Paul McCartney, the Grateful Dead, and New Kids 
on the Block (Ideal Ticket Agency); Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, and Madonna 
(Atlas Tickets); and Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and U2 (Trip Tickets). . . . 
Surprise guest at last Friday's Afropop Dance Party at the Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa: Zairean soukous superstar Tabu Ley, with seven musicians and dancers. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Richman will be making a solo concert appearance Feb. 11 at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Richman is the former leader of the Modern Lovers, a 
quirky New England band from the 1970s whose charter members include Cars 
drummer Dave Robinson and Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry Harrison. . . . 
Soundgarden, the hot new grunge-rock band from Seattle that Spin magazine 
recently predicted "could become the metal band for people who hate metal," 
will be appearing Feb. 16 at Iguanas in Tijuana. The group's drummer, Matt 
Cameron, is from San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Belly Up is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the 
recovery of a black 1964 Fender Stratocaster guitar and a Fender Twin Reverb 
amplifier stolen from the club on Jan. 5. The stuff belongs to Rosie Flores' 
guitarist. . . . Actor-cum-rocker Dennis Quaid's expected one-night stand 
Monday at the Belly Up has turned into a two-nighter. He'll perform Sunday 
night as well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Molly Hatchet on Thursday at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; the Beat Farmers, also Thursday, at the Belly Up; the 
Jesus and Mary Chain and Nine Inch Nails on Friday at the California Theater; 
Nite Soil Man, also Friday, at the Casbah in Middletown; the Pandoras Saturday 
at the Spirit in Bay Park, and Leslie West on Sunday at the Bacchanal.

ISAAC STERN PERFORMS AT PHILHARMONIC BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was time for the Los Angeles Philharmonic pension fund concert, Monday at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and the call of "Round up the usual suspects!" 
must have gone out. The names may change, but the faces -- and the music -- are 
always familiar at these annual benefits. 
</P>
<P>
For this edition the guests were conductor Leonard Slatkin and violinist Isaac 
Stern, and their subject matter was three middle-period Beethoven classics. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that the occasion found the 69-year-old violinist near the 
peak of his form. There were patches of mechanical disinterest and technical 
lapses, but for the most part Stern played with consistent spirit and control. 
</P>
<P>
His tone was bright and clear, seldom edgy, and the bravura bits 
well-articulated. He seemed more concerned with expressive elegance than 
muscular extroversion. He found particular passion in the Kreisler cadenzas, 
which he shaped with vigorous purpose and integrated into the concerto with 
rare authority and point. 
</P>
<P>
A miscalculation was the slow tempo for the Larghetto. Mining the wistful 
subtext, Stern projected affecting moments, but couldn't sustain a sense of 
connectedness and direction. The Rondo was also taken somewhat deliberately, 
but there the feeling was one of relaxed brio. 
</P>
<P>
Slatkin and a reduced band of beneficiaries accompanied gracefully, with 
tellingly deployed reserves of power. Occasionally they overwhelmed Stern's 
efforts, but the whole was a cohesive joy. 
</P>
<P>
For their own, Slatkin and the orchestra had the "Egmont" Overture and the 
Eighth Symphony. Slatkin's Eighth was swift, limber and dramatic, marked by 
strong dynamic contrasts and articulative punch. His "Egmont" -- the distortion 
of the opening sarabande rhythm aside -- was similar, both expressive and 
illuminative. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians responded with alert, balanced strength. Ensemble values were 
surprisingly high, given the limited rehearsal, in performances that repaid the 
benefaction with interest. JOHN HENKEN

FALLETTA COAXES THE RIGHT NOTE FROM S.D. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
JoAnn Falletta, music director of the Long Beach Symphony, made an auspicious 
local debut Monday night as guest conductor of the San Diego Chamber Orchestra. 
In addition to her poise on the podium and polished baton technique, Falletta 
was aided by oboe virtuoso Allan Vogel's wonted elegance in two oboe concertos. 
And the unusually eager cadre of orchestra musicians meant it was not business 
as usual at Sherwood Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta and company made their best case on the program's first half, devoted 
to a pair of harmonically untroubled 20th-Century works, Dominick Argento's 
"Homage to the Queen of Tonga" and Ralph Vaughan William's A Minor Oboe 
Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber orchestra has played the clever, pictorial Argento suite before, 
but not with the tight ensemble Falletta demanded, nor with as much ebullient 
good humor. Principal oboe Peggy Michel negotiated her many prickly solos with 
stylish bravura; this was a banner evening for double reeds. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel approached the long-winded lyricism of Vaughan Williams' concerto as an 
extended soliloquy, which he infused with both ardor and eloquence. Falletta 
thoughtfully shaped the composer's nervous invention -- the concerto is not one 
of his meandering bucolic reveries -- coaxing a halo of warm string tone to 
surround the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Although Falletta displayed evident authority and finesse, her baton was not a 
magic wand. She could not make this group, with its limited rehearsal schedule, 
into a supple Mozart orchestra overnight. 
</P>
<P>
In Mozart's effervescent Symphony No. 29 in A Major, she had to settle for 
robust enthusiasm cloaked in a strident tone from the violins in their more 
extroverted moments. Although it takes a greater measure of discipline to give 
Mozart's sunny opus an unforced brilliance, Falletta paced its many contrasts 
with the symphony's overall shape clearly in mind. Her sense of Mozartean drama 
and architecture could not be faulted. 
</P>
<P>
In Alessandro Marcello's D Minor Oboe Concerto, Vogel's fleet technique gave 
the rarely heard Baroque gem its due, even if the orchestra's ragged octaves 
provided occasional distractions. The performance overall left but one 
lingering question. How soon will Falletta return to a San Diego podium?

NOTHING COMICAL IN 'WOMEN AND WALLACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"American Playhouse" is off to a wobbly start this season. Tonight's show, 
"Women and Wallace" (at 9 on Channels 28 and 15), is even more grinding and 
self-conscious than last week's stodgy opener, the East Coast elitist drama, 
"Sensibility and Sense." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening to "American Playhouse"? These first two productions of the 
ninth season have been dreary. At least last Wednesday's play, co-starring Jean 
Simmons and Elaine Stritch as besieged old leftists, had its moments. Tonight's 
play opens with a mother's suicide and follows her young son's subsequent 
efforts to deal with girls in his anguished adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
The play supposedly is a dark comedy but on television, under Don Scardino's 
arty direction, it's merely bleak. Perhaps the major problem is that the 
playwright, 20-year-old Jonathan Marc Sherman, wrote this semi-autobiographical 
play when he was 18. Adolescence will out. 
</P>
<P>
Credit the producers with giving youth an opportunity. (The play was a winner 
at the 1988 Young Playwrights Festival at Playwrights Horizons in New York; 
coincidentally, it's also currently on stage at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.) 
What a break for a juvenile work. 
</P>
<P>
The only way a play like this could work is to go for a black humor. But 
there's nothing comical here. The handsome youth is played with a teen-ager's 
basic insecurities by Josh Hamilton, who did the play in New York. His 
dialogue, both directly to the camera and to other characters (most prominently 
the luminous Joanna Going), is full of posturing, self-protective devices. 
</P>
<P>
At one point he describes his dead mother (whom we saw slitting her throat) as 
"Sylvia Plath without the talent." That's a smart line but not from a grieving 
son. 
</P>
<P>
At least the youth's grandmother (nicely portrayed by Joan Copeland) has it 
right: "A dead mother doesn't give you carte blanche to screw up," she tells 
him. A tip of the cap to playwright Sherman for some belated wisdom and 
maturity. There's hope for Sherman. But what about "American Playhouse"?RAY

FRUSTRATING EPISODES OF 'AIDS QUARTERLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Tales of Frustration" might be the umbrella title for two of the segments -- 
the third was unavailable for review -- of the latest "The AIDS Quarterly" 
(tonight at 8, Channels 28, 50, 15 and 24). 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco immunologist, Alan Levin, with the encouragement of AIDS 
activist Martin Delaney, made a leap into the ethical void last year when he 
decided to test the powerful drug Compound-Q on volunteer patients with 
advanced cases of AIDS. A big problem, besides the fact that the drug was still 
being tested by the Food and Drug Administration and therefore not yet approved 
for use, was not knowing when a dosage level became fatally toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the first three volunteers died within months of taking Compound-Q, 
leaving Levin in an ethical gray area. The report pictures him in a dilemma: On 
one side is Delaney, imploring him to continue testing what may eventually be 
"the magic bullet" for the virus; on the other side is the FDA, ordering him to 
stop the unauthorized testing. This is the other, continuing Drug War, putting 
doctors in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
"Money and Morals," an unusually hard hitting segment for the generally soft 
"AIDS Quarterly," shows how three states dole out AIDS education money, 
distributed federally via the Centers for Disease Control. It indirectly raises 
questions about how Christian some "Christians" are. 
</P>
<P>
After the passage of Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-N.C.) bill preventing federal funds 
from directly supporting gay activist organizations, the Centers for Disease 
Control became a money conduit for the states, which then decide which 
educational organizations are funded. 
</P>
<P>
Well-funded efforts in Florida have a fraction of the effect of privately 
funded, grass-roots projects. In Colorado, a hi-tech, Big Brother approach 
tracks down AIDS carriers and partners with such intimidation that it may be 
driving people with AIDS underground. North Carolina's Christian right stopped 
all education funding to community-based groups in 1988 because of material 
some ministers and politicians deemed as "obscene." North Carolina activist 
David Jones laments on-camera: "We gave AIDS a headstart in this state."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WIFE CHARGED IN MURDER OF HUSBAND, ASSASSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sepulveda woman was charged Tuesday with soliciting her husband's murder, 
then paying assassins to kill the man who allegedly arranged her husband's 
death, authorities said. Two San Fernando Valley men were also charged in the 
second death plot. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Samuels, 41, faces two counts of murder with the special 
circumstance of soliciting a killing for financial gain. Police said Samuels 
wanted her husband dead so she could receive insurance payments and his 
business and property. She was being held without bail at the Van Nuys jail. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were Samuel's husband, Robert Samuels, 40, who was shot to death 
Dec. 9, 1988, in the couple's home in the 15800 block of Bahama Street, and 
James Bernstein, 26, of Reseda, whose body was found July 23, 1989, in Lockwood 
Canyon in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in Bernstein's killing are Paul Edwin Gaul, 26, of Sylmar, and 
Darrell Ray Edwards, 38, of Arleta. Samuels and Gaul were arrested Friday but 
police were still searching for Edwards.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ELKS LODGE INDUCTS FIRST BLACK MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Van Nuys Elks Lodge inducted its first black member Thursday after a 
months-long controversy that brought on a state investigation of the fraternal 
organization's racial policies. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Harvey, 41 of Pacoima, the manager of a laminating plant, received the 
lodge's membership badge -- a gold lapel pin -- after swearing eternal 
brotherhood with fellow Elks. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office has been investigating whether the lodge 
violated state civil rights laws by twice rejecting two other blacks who 
applied for membership. Lodge officials said they were turned down because 
other members resented the involvement of fellow Elk and state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana), who nominated them. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said the state investigation is continuing, but 
that Harvey's admission will be considered "one piece of evidence that the 
organization does not discriminate on the basis of race."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PILOT OF BOAT THAT HIT TANKER PLEADS NO 
CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a sportfishing boat that collided with a 564-foot tanker outside 
Los Angeles Harbor last November pleaded no contest at a Coast Guard 
administrative hearing Tuesday to failure to maintain a proper lookout and 
failure to navigate with due caution. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Filson, who was piloting the 80-foot fishing boat Shogun, faces possible 
suspension or revocation of his operating license as a result of the accident, 
which injured seven passengers and spilled 2,000 gallons of fuel into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the accident, Filson switched on the boat's automatic pilot and 
went below deck. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the tanker Antarctic, Capt. Arthur Irish, faces a negligence 
charge for violating international navigation rules, including failure to give 
way to a vessel crossing from the tanker's starboard side and failure to avoid 
the crash. He faces a Feb. 13 Coast Guard hearing. Judge H.J. Gardner will rule 
on the Filson case Feb. 7.

McMartin Buckey, parents of McMartin Pre-School students and child abuse 
organizations are staging a highly public campaign to protest the verdict and 
persuade prosecutors to retry Ray Buckey on 13 charges that ended in mistrial 
after the jury deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
During the two weeks since the acquittals on 52 counts were announced, the 
parents and their allies have appeared on national television talk shows, held 
press conferences, lobbied the county Board of Supervisors, collected what they 
describe as 6,000 letters of support -- and even asked comedians to keep the 
issue alive by continuing to ridicule the McMartin verdict in their routines. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been joined by families whose children testified. These 
families had remained silent throughout the nearly 3-year trial. This week, one 
of the families is featured on the cover of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were meeting late Tuesday with Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner to decide 
whether to seek a retrial on the hung counts. Reiner's decision was to be 
announced early today. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the final decision rests with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge 
William Pounders, who presided over the trial. He said Tuesday that he has 
conferred with the presiding judge of the Superior Court and the presiding 
judge of its criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his call," said Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard Byrne. He 
explained that new evidence is not necessary, but only a reasonable expectation 
on the judge's part that the case, if retried, would be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"From what Judge Pounders has said," Byrne said, "his opinion is that . . . the 
verdict could have gone either way." 
</P>
<P>
Pounders, the judge explained, could decide against a retrial if he believes 
there is no "reasonable expectation" of a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also a concern with the utilization of resources," Byrne added, 
referring to the $15 million the case has already cost county taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-man, four-woman jury split 8-4 in favor of acquittal on most of the 
undecided counts, and 7-5 on one, according to one juror who asked not to be 
identified. The juror said four colleagues strongly believed in Ray Buckey's 
innocence and another four strongly thought him guilty. Most of the jurors have 
honored a pact not to reveal how they were split on the hung counts. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the 13 undecided counts, one alleging conspiracy and one alleging sodomy 
of the child who triggered the case, will not be pursued, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The other 11 counts involve four children. Two families have indicated a 
willingness to go forward and the other two have refused, according to sources 
close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, representatives of child abuse groups, including FOCOS (Families 
Of Crimes Of Silence), the Adam Walsh Center, Believe the Children and the 
Hispanic Theatre Project, gathered in front of the downtown Criminal Courts 
building to express their views, then moved on to the Hall of Administration 
where the county Board of Supervisors were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
There, following an emotional hour of testimony from McMartin parents and one 
former student, the board voted 4-1 to ask Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp to 
review the 60,000 pages of court transcripts as well as the comments of jurors 
to determine if the historic molestation prosecution was botched and if the 13 
deadlocked charges should be refiled. 
</P>
<P>
The board asked the attorney general's office to review the public comments of 
some jurors who said that they believed some children had been molested but 
that prosecutors had "failed to prove the molestations," or at least that the 
Buckeys were responsible. The supervisors requested a report "concerning this 
discrepancy." 
</P>
<P>
The measure also asks that if Reiner chooses not to refile the charges, that he 
give the attorney general an opportunity to enter the case. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who authored the non-binding resolution, told his 
fellow supervisors, "The testimony was remarkable . . . (and) shows the need 
for refiling the 13 counts." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edleman, the only attorney serving on the board, opposed the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sympathize with what people are saying here today," he said. "But 
shouldn't this decision by the district attorney be made on the basis of the 
law and . . . without regard for who is saying what? . . . For us to say 
prosecute or don't prosecute or to even to bring in the attorney general is 
highly questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who voted for the resolution, also showed some 
reservations about the Antonovich motion. "It was the longest case in U.S. 
history. They had their day in court." 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Reiner, said, "We will not base our case on 
any political pressure" and accused the board of "inflaming" the emotions that 
engulfed the longest and costliest criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
The request by the board is unusual. County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said he 
cannot recall a case where the board took this level of action. And a spokesman 
for the attorney general also could not recall any cases in which the Board of 
Supervisors asked the state to enter a case. He said the attorney general would 
have no comment until it had reviewed the request. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Buckeys have complained about the public protests against the 
verdict, saying that the jurors were in the best position to decide the case 
and that their acquittals should be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne described the campaign to influence Reiner and Pounders as "very rare, as 
McMartin is a very unusual and rare case. . . . It has all the ingredients to 
arouse public passion -- defendants dragged through the system and children's 
claims rejected." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more unusual elements of the campaign, a coalition of child abuse 
watchdog groups wrote an open letter to comedians asking that they "include in 
their material comments ridiculing the McMartin verdict."

D.A. WON'T FILE CHARGES AGAINST MAN WHO KEPT WIFE LOCKED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has decided not to file 
criminal charges against the husband of a mentally distraught woman who was 
kept isolated in a cell-like bedroom for two months, a prosecutor in Pomona 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Coenan, 41, was arrested Dec. 5 after Pomona police found his wife 
incoherent, bruised and confined in a boarded-up room at a residence in the 
Phillips Ranch area. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. John Hayes said the case was being "kicked back to police 
detectives for further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Carolyn Lundstrum said Coenan has refused to discuss the case with 
police. She added that the wife's father and stepmother, Floyd and Audrey 
Twede, who live at the house, also refused to answer police questions. The 
Twedes were not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the husband and the Twedes told investigators that Marianne 
Coenan, 31, was isolated so she could safely recover from a mental breakdown 
suffered in October. When police and Los Angeles County mental health workers 
found Coenan, she was locked behind a door into which a small, square window 
was cut and steel bars had been inserted. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the family was not under obligation to report (the 
confinement)," Hayes said. "Our decision not to file charges was based on 
insufficient information to support the case. From what I read between the 
lines, these people actually thought they were benefiting this woman." 
</P>
<P>
The family, which belongs to the Church of Scientology, apparently adhered to 
beliefs espoused by the church's late founder, L. Ron Hubbard -- particularly, 
a disdain for psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Coenan's confinement was consistent with the method of treating mental 
breakdowns described in Scientology literature that police requested and 
reviewed while investigating the case, Lundstrum said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the report we submitted, the (district attorney's) office was not 
convinced that any criminal activity took place," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hayes said the investigation will continue until additional 
relatives and friends of the woman are questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the police to conduct a few more interviews," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the wife has been questioned yet," he said. "I believe her 
condition has improved greatly, though. The detectives will talk to her when 
she is able to handle an interview."

EPA REJECTS WAIVER OF TIGHTER STANDARDS AT CARSON SEWAGE PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PLANT PUMPS ESTIMATED 365 MILLION GALLONS OF EFFLUENT INTO OCEAN 
DAILY. SANITATION OFFICIALS SAY THEY'LL FIGHT TENTATIVE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday tentatively rejected a 
request for a federal waiver to exempt the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts' sewage plant in Carson from tighter treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
The decision concerns an estimated 365 million gallons of effluent that the 
Carson plant pumps daily through ocean outfalls about 1 1/2 miles off the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials have argued that the waste is clean enough and that 
removing more solids from it would be dangerous because they help cap a layer 
of bay sediment contaminated in the 1950s and '60s by hundreds of tons of the 
pesticide DDT. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel McGovern, the EPA's regional administrator, rejected both arguments in a 
statement issued Tuesday. He said the agency could not legally grant a waiver 
based on the DDT concerns and added: "EPA has determined that the discharge is 
not needed to ensure that the DDT remains buried." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern said the county sanitation districts failed to meet several key 
conditions for a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, the county did not demonstrate that its waste-water 
discharge would allow the natural fish and shellfish populations to thrive on 
the Palos Verdes Shelf," he said. "EPA found that many native species that are 
sensitive to pollution could not tolerate the county's discharge." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's tentative ruling is subject to a public comment period and, if it is 
made final, to administrative and judicial appeal. But opponents of the waiver 
termed the decision a key turning point in the sanitation districts' 11-year 
battle to win an exemption from tougher federal treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and lawmakers from coastal communities have long argued that 
intensified treatment would spare Santa Monica Bay from large amounts of oil, 
grease, toxic metals and other pollutants contained in effluent from the Carson 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive and significant decision for Santa Monica Bay," said 
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica). "EPA is showing its muscle by 
demonstrating they are not afraid to 'Just say no' to polluters." 
</P>
<P>
But the sanitation districts issued a statement saying they "disagree strongly" 
with the EPA decision, and hinting they will fight if it becomes final. The 
statement said there is an "exhaustive amount of evidence" showing the 
districts qualify for a waiver, and drew attention to the problem of the buried 
DDT. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,800 tons of DDT were discharged in sewage pumped through the 
Carson outfalls in the 1950s and '60s, and 200 tons of it are believed to still 
be embedded in a 13.5-square-mile area of sediment off Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
The sanitation districts contend that solids from the plant have played a key 
part in keeping the harmful pesticide buried. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we believe EPA made the wrong decision for the environment, we will 
continue to pursue the recourse offered to us by law," the districts' statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials have estimated it would cost ratepayers $350 million to 
meet a federal requirement that sewage plants provide full secondary treatment, 
a system that makes use of biological processes to remove 85% of solids from 
waste water. 
</P>
<P>
Already, secondary treatment is provided for 60% of the effluent from the 
Carson plant, which serves cities stretching from Palos Verdes Estates to 
Pomona. But the rest receives primary treatment, a less intensive method of 
removing solids that involves settling, screening and the use of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA believes that if fewer solids flow through the Palos Verdes outfalls, 
natural sedimentation in the area would still keep the DDT covered, said 
Loretta Barsamian of the agency's wetlands, oceans and estuaries division.

SUSPECT HELD IN SHOOTING OF POLICEMAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: EL MONTE OFFICER ANSWERING ROUTINE CALL ON FORGERY ATTEMPT WAS 
APPARENTLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An El Monte police officer remained in critical condition Tuesday after a 
routine call to investigate a forgery attempt at a bank ended with the suspect 
shooting him in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Johnston, 35, a second-year officer, was taken to County-USC Medical 
Center after the lunch-hour attack Monday at an El Monte branch of Security 
Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the shooting, police arrested Nguyen Lu, 27, at his 
sister's home in Temple City. Nguyen, who is unemployed, was being held in Los 
Angeles County Jail without bail. He is expected to be arraigned today on an 
attempted murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
"What's so shocking is that this was not the type of call where you would 
expect a violent confrontation," said El Monte Sgt. Craig Sperry, adding that 
it was the first shooting of a police officer in that city in more than 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Johnston didn't even have his gun drawn," Sperry said. "You generally 
wouldn't on a call of this nature." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston arrived at the bank, near the corner of Valley Mall and Ramona 
Boulevard, about 12:30 p.m. Monday, after bank officers reported that someone 
was trying to cash a $1,000 check on a closed account. 
</P>
<P>
As Johnston stepped through the first of two glass doors at the entrance, the 
suspect opened the second door, police said. They met in the vestibule. 
</P>
<P>
Before Johnston could react, Nguyen calmly pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
pistol at the officer, fired once, and walked out of the bank, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no exchange," said Sperry. "He just fired at the officer, stepped 
over his body and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't hard for police to find him. Nguyen had left his driver's license on 
the bank counter. Witnesses had also jotted down the license number of his 
white Toyota, which was traced to his sister's Temple City address. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen surrendered without incident, police said. The pistol that officers 
believe was used in the attack was in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives at the neat, one-story home on La Rosa Drive were reluctant to 
discuss the incident, although they did say that Nguyen is a Vietnamese refugee 
who came to the United States about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Johnston is married and has one child. His father, Loren 
Johnston, retired from the El Monte Police Department in 1987 after more than 
18 years on the force.

MILKEN'S LAWYERS SAID TO BE IN TALKS ON PLEA BARGAIN 
</P>

<P>
A long-expected new indictment of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond 
chief Michael Milken has been delayed again, this time because Milken's lawyers 
have held talks with federal prosecutors on a possible plea agreement, sources 
close to the case said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the sources cautioned that such contact is fairly "routine" at this stage 
in a criminal case. They said there wasn't any indication that the two sides 
would reach an agreement or that they were even close to one. The prosecutors, 
meanwhile, have informed all of the individuals who may be named as defendants 
in the new indictment that it still could be filed within days, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 43, was named last March in a 98-count federal indictment in New York. 
It accused him of violating the federal racketeering law through a pattern of 
securities fraud and stock market manipulation while he headed Drexel's junk 
bond operations in Beverly Hills. His brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader 
Bruce L. Newberg also were named in the indictment. All have pleaded not guilty 
and said they will vigorously fight the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said publicly for months that a "superseding" indictment will 
be filed in the case. The new indictment, originally expected last fall, is to 
contain many additional charges and name more defendants. Sources have said the 
new charges will include additional counts of insider trading, relating to 
trading in securities of Caesars World Inc. and Tiger International Inc. Milken 
is also expected to be charged with using highly valuable warrants and other 
securities to pay off some customers personally in exchange for having their 
firms buy junk bonds of doubtful value. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers had also held talks with the government shortly before the 
original indictment was returned last year about a possible settlement. But 
those talks led nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
One source said of the contacts within the past two weeks by Milken's lawyers 
and federal prosecutors that "they're negotiating to cut a deal." He said the 
lawyers have attempted to work out a possible accord, which would then be 
presented to Milken. But, the source said, no tentative deal has been reached, 
and if one is hammered out, "I don't think anyone knows, including Milken, if 
he's going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lerer, a spokesman for Milken, said: "We have not commented in the past and 
we are not going to start commenting now on the unfair press leaks that have 
accompanied this case and that are designed to deny Mike Milken a fair trial." 
He added: "Rather than printing the rumor of the day, everyone would be better 
served by waiting for the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Jess Fardella, an assistant U.S. attorney on the case, refused to answer 
questions about possible talks. He said: "I have no comment on any aspect of 
the case." 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lead defense lawyer is Arthur L. Liman, who gained national attention 
as chief counsel for the Senate in the televised Iran/Contra hearings in 1987. 
Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney in Liman's office, promised to return a 
reporter's phone call on Tuesday but didn't call back. 
</P>
<P>
Another source involved in the case also said "discussions are going on" 
between Liman's firm and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. People 
involved in the case note that, in recent months, a long list of former Milken 
co-workers and clients have become cooperating witnesses for the government. 
Several of them were among Milken's closest associates, including Gary Winnick, 
the former head of Drexel's convertible bond department, who later headed an 
investment partnership in which Milken held a large interest. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers involved in the case, as well as defense lawyers who aren't, have said 
the long list of government witnesses could make it extremely difficult for 
Milken to win an acquittal. Milken and his lawyers have long maintained that he 
didn't violate any laws. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear under what conditions, if any, Milken might find a plea 
agreement acceptable. The charges contained in the indictment already filed 
carry potential penalties of many years in prison and forfeiture of assets 
totaling $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The superseding indictment has been repeatedly postponed, at one point because 
Liman was involved in a trial in another case. Government lawyers had informed 
defense lawyers that the new indictment would be returned last week, and then 
had named specific days. But each time the filing was delayed. Prosecutors told 
defense lawyers Monday that the indictment still may be filed within several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick P. Hafetz, a lawyer representing Newberg, refused to answer any 
questions about the activities of Milken's lawyers. But referring to Newberg's 
defense team, he said: "We are not having any discussions with the government." 
He added: "We're awaiting the superseding indictment, and we expect to go to 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Armstrong, the lawyer for Lowell Milken, said: "As a matter of policy I 
am not commenting on anything."

ALL-SPORTS NEWSPAPER KICKS OFF AS INDUSTRY WATCHES FROM SIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Even before it prints its maiden edition today, the much awaited daily sports 
newspaper called the National already may have subtracted from the quality of 
sports journalism in America. 
</P>
<P>
At least to the extent that it has taken Frank Deford away from writing long, 
inventive feature pieces for Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Deford, who is arguably the country's premier sports writer, is the 
National's editor-in-chief, chief architect, top spokesman and also its TV 
pitchman in ads hawking the paper's launch today in Los Angeles, New York and 
Chicago. But his writing will be limited to a once-a-week column. 
</P>
<P>
What lured him and what has piqued the curiosity of the publishing industry is 
the prospect of the first nationwide newspaper devoted exclusively to sports. 
And it also may be a chance to test what could be a new direction in American 
newspapers -- narrow-interest publications aimed at attracting people who don't 
read other daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Two somewhat limited attempts to start all-sports newspapers in this country 
failed in the 1980s, including one by the Pasadena Star News under then-owner 
Knight Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
But Deford and his crew believe that they can duplicate the success of the 
sports dailies thriving in Europe and Latin America by having circulation sales 
instead of advertising drive the paper. The strategy, unusual in the United 
States, relies heavily on editorial strength, such as Deford's. 
</P>
<P>
The National already caused tremors of worry and expectation in the journalism 
fraternity last summer when Deford managed to nab several marquee sports 
writers, among them Scott Ostler of the Los Angeles Times, Mike Lupica of the 
New York Daily News and Dave Kindred of the Atlanta Constitution, along with 
two Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It also has the considerable finances of elusive Mexican television magnate 
Emilio Azcarraga, plus the skills of Deford's former Princeton classmate, Peter 
Price, the former publisher of the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
What they have produced is a Sunday- through-Friday tabloid of about 48 pages, 
a local section for each city edition with one long feature each day, a SWAT 
team of columnists -- and so many tables and statistics that hockey fans can 
track the "power-play efficiency" of every team daily. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental question implicit is how deep is America's appetite for sports 
-- when fans already can watch ESPN at night, get the local paper in the 
morning, then USA Today, and once a week the Sporting News and Sports 
Illustrated. Price, the publisher, is hoping to guarantee an initial 
circulation of 200,000-250,000 from the first three cities, and plans to be in 
12 more by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is also the broader question here about where newspapers are headed. 
</P>
<P>
Younger Americans are not turning to newspapers as they grow up the way 
previous generations did. The National is built in part on the theory that some 
of those who get their news from television may still turn to reading every day 
if the newspaper is focused on their specialized interests. 
</P>
<P>
If so, targeted or niche-market newspapers -- by demographic group, subject 
matter, age, etc. -- might signal the direction of newspapers in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, even Price is estimating that the paper may need five years and $100 
million to make a profit. Azcarraga, who is paying most of the bills, avoids 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-thought-out approach," said John Reidy, the publishing analyst 
with Drexel Burnham Lambert. "But the real thing is getting the readers." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there are enormous risks. For one, skeptics note that USA Today has 
yet to turn an annual profit, with losses estimated around $600 million since 
its launch in September, 1982 -- not counting the costs Gannett absorbed by 
borrowing staff and resources from its 80-plus local papers. 
</P>
<P>
While it has circulation -- roughly 1.4 million as of last September -- USA 
Today does not have enough advertising. One reason is that the national 
advertising market for print has weakened, perhaps permanently, with several 
categories such as liquor and tobacco never returning to the levels of the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Price said the National is predicated on a delicate strategy that might avoid 
this problem: He wants to build the paper's cost structure so that it can 
survive largely on circulation, not advertising. 
</P>
<P>
This would make it more in the manner of a European paper, which might get 70% 
of revenue from circulation and only about 30% from ads. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the structure of newspapers is just the opposite -- 
largely because American papers are home delivered and contain so many pages 
that they are more expensive to produce than European papers. As a rule, the 25 
cents that the reader plunks down doesn't even cover the cost of the newsprint. 
Advertising must make up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
To break the cycle, a newspaper would have to be thin, which would mean it 
could contain less news. 
</P>
<P>
But as a specialized publication, the National is hoping that at 48 pages it 
can both be the most in-depth provider of sports news and still be small enough 
that its newsprint costs will be low. Price says newsprint will only cost him 
about 10 cents a copy. 
</P>
<P>
To keep distribution costs low as well, it has contracted with Dow Jones, 
publisher of the national Wall Street Journal, to deliver the paper to 
newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is eventually profitable, Price said he expects the National not to 
get more than 50% of revenue from advertising. 
</P>
<P>
So far, ad commitments are impressive, analysts report, but at less than 
$10,000 for a full-color national page and less than $4,000 for a local page, 
the National is cheap to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could be done, but I would have believed this strategy more if they 
were selling for a higher newsstand price than 50 cents," said Ken Noble, a 
publishing analyst with the brokerage firm Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
With this approach, "the most important thing will be to get enough readers," 
said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst with the brokerage firm of 
Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Even a quarter of a million readers won't do it, even just for three cities, 
said Reidy. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the strategy, though, is that the National is largely driven by 
the journalism. Of the 175 member staff, an extraordinary 125 are reporters and 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier era, the Wall Street Journal was analogous, specialized enough to 
be thorough in only a few pages. Yet as its readership grew, so did its 
advertising, and now its cost structure is advertising-driven like most of the 
rest of American media. 
</P>
<P>
And the Wall Street Journal in the beginning had little competition, since most 
business sections were a newspaper's backwater, hidden behind the sports pages 
and the tire ads. 
</P>
<P>
There is intense competition facing the National -- from strong local sports 
coverage in newspapers, to ESPN's all sports channel on cable TV, to sports 
phones, CNN and USA Today, which already produces the most detailed sports 
section in the country. 
</P>
<P>
To distinguish itself, the National's statistics and reports are even more 
detailed. A key question about the paper's success is how much more people 
really want. 
</P>
<P>
If the National is right that people do want still more, USA Today could be one 
of those hardest hit. For despite recent statements to the contrary from 
officials at USA Today, sources closely familiar with USA Today's internal 
research said its fine sports section is one of the primary reasons people buy 
that paper. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is whether the National can survive entirely on street sales in 
an industry built on home delivery. 
</P>
<P>
One of the National's ads for Southern California, for instance, notes that 
"there are only six newsstands in L.A. County," and pleads to viewers, "You 
guys are going to have to help us." 
</P>
<P>
Without intending to, the ad also highlights still another problem. One of the 
keys to whether the National succeeds will be how well it mixes local copy -- 
the Southern California edition includes coverage of all the local teams and a 
separate local columnist each day -- into an essentially national publication. 
</P>
<P>
Can a central desk in New York be so multi-regional? The ad about Los Angeles 
sounds just a bit dismissive, as if it were written by a smug New Yorker: "You 
come out of your house, get into the car, pull into an underground garage, go 
up into the office, never breathing the smog." 
</P>
<P>
In Azcarraga, the most important figure in Spanish language television, the 
National is backed by one of the richest men in the world and one with a 
reputation for taking a long-term view of his investments. 
</P>
<P>
In hiring Deford, the National also hit a home run. Then Deford and Price 
followed with a strategy that has made the paper the most anticipated venture 
in newspaper publishing since USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
After saying nothing publicly about the paper at first, all at once Deford made 
extravagant offers to some of the best-known sports writers in America, 
including Jim Murray and Ostler of The Times. Among those hired, reportedly 
doubling salaries and guaranteeing multi-year contracts in some cases, were 
Ostler, Lupica, Kindred and John Feinstein, who struck it rich writing a book 
about basketball coach Bobby Knight. Then he hired two highly regarded sports 
editors, Van McKenzie of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution and Vince Doria 
of the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
That was carefully thought out to get journalists to say, " 'If these people 
are talking to all of these people at once, what the hell is this thing,' " 
said Deford, a writer who, as a star of Lite Beer commercials and a veteran of 
10 book tours, had a fine understanding of the black art of promotion. "They 
had to take us seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the National, as USA Today Managing Editor for Sports Gene Policinski 
has dismissively suggested, mostly long stories. The bulk of it is statistics 
and short reports, gossip, facts and factoids ad infinitum -- or ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
All together, the National resembles USA Today more than Deford's alma mater, 
Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
It even has a color weather map, with the various stadium sites listed and 
weather forecasts for key games.

HILTON DIRECTORS DISCUSS FUTURE OF LODGING FIRM

<TEXT>
<P>
Following inconclusive meetings Tuesday, the directors of Hilton Hotels Corp. 
were scheduled to meet again today in Beverly Hills to discuss alternatives for 
the future of the venerable lodging company. 
</P>
<P>
The directors are said to be discussing several strategies, including a 
possible restructuring that would not involve a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Several firms have reportedly expressed an interest in buying Hilton, including 
JMB Realty in Chicago and a group led by Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company's stock continued its long descent Tuesday, closing at 
$57.75 per share Tuesday, down $2.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading. It had 
hit a 52-week high of $115.50 last August, but the stock has been in a general 
decline ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton officially placed itself on the auction block last August. It owns two 
casino hotels in Las Vegas and one in Reno and owns, leases or manages others. 
</P>
<P>
Two similar hotel companies, Ramada and Holiday Corp., have undergone major 
reorganizations in recent months by splitting their hotel and casino businesses 
into separate firms.

NEW PC NETWORK TO USE RADIO SIGNALS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: THE IBM AND MOTOROLA JOINT VENTURE IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE USERS 
ACCESS TO LARGE COMPUTER DATABASES.

International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc. said Tuesday that they 
are launching a personal computer network that uses radio signals, a technology 
expected to create a billion-dollar market and allow access to large computer 
databases from virtually anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech giants said they have formed a new company to provide a 
nationwide radio communications service giving workers outside the office the 
ability to converse with their big mainframe computers. 
</P>
<P>
Armies of technicians and service workers in the field could potentially tap 
into the IBM-Motorola computer network. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, Ardis, will begin full commercial operation in early April and 
provide immediate service to more than 8,000 municipalities in all 50 states 
using IBM's nationwide private radio data system and Motorola's shared-use 
radio data network, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, Ardis is taking the personal computer out of the office, putting 
it in a vehicle or briefcase, and replacing the wire with a two-way radio," 
said Art Sundry, president of Motorola's Communications sector. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said Ardis aims to improve productivity for many of the 10 million 
U.S. field workers such as salespeople and service workers by providing 
reliable mobile data communications. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a tremendous emphasis on productivity in the factory, but 
really until now this has not been applied to sales people and other mobile 
workers," Gordon Comerford, Ardis chairman and a Motorola senior vice 
president, told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Pricing for the service has not been determined, but Comerford estimated it 
would cost $100 to $150 a month for the average customer. "It's a fantastic 
pay-back," he said. "It could pay for itself in one new service call a month." 
</P>
<P>
Schaumberg, Ill.-based Motorola designed, manufactured and installed IBM's 
radio data network in 1983. The network is used by 16,000 IBM service personnel 
and 2,000 service workers in the Rolm telecommunications unit. 
</P>
<P>
Senior IBM executives have cited the mobile radio network as a major advantage 
when other communications lines are not available or are damaged.

LORENZO HINTS AT CONTINENTAL, EASTERN MERGER 
</P>

<P>
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., was reported Tuesday to have 
strongly suggested that he intends to merge bankrupt Eastern Airlines into 
Continental Airlines. Both carriers are Texas Air subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo made his intentions known at a meeting with airline analysts for 
securities firms. The gathering was closed to the press, and Lorenzo could not 
be reached for comment afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
"He all but implied that the two would be combined," said one analyst who asked 
for anonymity. "He said it was clearly feasible and that it makes sense to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The analyst said Lorenzo "was very careful not to be definitive. This was all 
in the context of a feasible plan." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo was said to have described how the fleets of the two carriers are 
compatible, and, in fact, airliners are already being moved back and forth 
between the two airlines. Lorenzo also reportedly said the labor costs of 
unionized Eastern and non-union Continental are comparable. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst who attended the luncheon said Lorenzo indicated that talks 
about such a consolidation have taken place between Eastern and its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which filed for protection from creditors last March under Chapter 11 
of U.S. Bankruptcy Code, last week presented a reorganization plan that must be 
approved by the creditors. The creditors are reported to be less than happy 
about the plan since they are being offered only 10 cents on the dollar in cash 
and another 70% of what they are owned during the next decade with no interest. 
In return, Texas Air would transfer ownership of 40% of Eastern's stock to the 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
If a merger of the two airlines were attempted before Eastern emerges from 
bankruptcy, the creditors and the bankruptcy court in New York would also have 
to give their approval. Spokesmen for the creditors could not be reached 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said Lorenzo did not make the comments concerning the merger in 
answer to a question but brought up the subject himself at the start of his 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said, "The discussions (with the analysts) 
were meant to be private." However, he conceded, "The merger of the two 
airlines is among the many options that have been considered, but no decision 
has been made." 
</P>
<P>
After a reporter sought comment on Lorenzo, Kent said he reached the chairman, 
who told him that "he had not said anything about a merger that he had not said 
in the past." Lorenzo had told Business Week magazine last week that such a 
merger "is not a crazy idea." 
</P>
<P>
Russ McGarry, a representative of the machinists union, which went on strike 
against Eastern five days before the carrier filed for bankruptcy, said: "What 
is the difference how we feel about (a merger). It is something we thought he 
would do a long while back. It would come as no surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the pilots and flight attendants, which honored the machinists' 
picket lines until recently, could also not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Meshing Eastern's unionized workers with Continental's non-union work force 
would undoubtedly draw opposition from Eastern's unions, but since they have no 
contract with the carrier, it is believed that they would not be able to block 
a merger.

KELSO TO BUY 2 SOUTHLAND METAL PRODUCTS FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
METALS: THE NEW YORK MERCHANT BANKER STRIKES A DEAL WITH EARLE M. JORGENSEN CO. 
AND KILSBY-ROBERTS.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
New York merchant banker Kelso &amp; Co. will acquire and merge two independent 
distributors of metal products -- the Lynwood-based Earle M. Jorgensen Co. and 
the Brea-based Kilsby-Roberts Holdings Inc. -- under an agreement announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelso, which already owns about 5% of privately held Kilsby-Roberts, will pay 
$75 million for the remainder of Kilsby-Roberts and $261 million -- $41.50 per 
share -- for Jorgensen. In addition, Kelso will assume debt of both companies 
and will cover additional costs of executive stock options, said Michael 
Gordon, a managing director of Kelso. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen shareholders will be paid in cash. The company's stock rose $9.50, 
closing at $40, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is a corporate milestone for the Jorgensen firm, whose namesake and 
chairman has gained notoriety for his longstanding friendship with former 
President Ronald Reagan. Earle M. Jorgensen, 91, founded the firm in 1921 and 
carved a commercial niche by processing and distributing metal to producers of 
oil drilling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The firm now grinds and cuts steel and aluminum and delivers its products to a 
wide range of manufacturers. It is the nation's fifth-largest distributor of 
metal products. The company had earnings of $9 million on sales of about $474 
million in 1988, compared to net income of $9 million and revenue of $341.4 
million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kilsby-Roberts, with estimated annual revenue of about $300 million, is a 
leading distributor of metal tubing and pipe products. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen is to become chairman of the newly merged company pending completion 
of a tender offer for Jorgensen Co. shares. The 30-day offer will be made on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Neven Hulsey, chairman and chief executive of Kilsby-Roberts, is to be named 
president and chief executive of the new company, Kelso's Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said the merged firm would be balanced and shielded from industry 
crashes because Jorgensen and Kilsby-Roberts have distinctly different metal 
product lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity to build a very significant company in this industry," 
Gordon said. "There would be savings in overhead and administration. They have 
complementary lines." 
</P>
<P>
The two companies will be maintained under their current names and will operate 
as separate divisions under a parent corporation to be called Earle M. 
Jorgensen Holdings Co. 
</P>
<P>
The merged firm would become the largest independent distributor of metal 
products in the nation and would rank second only to a subsidiary of Inland 
Steel in overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen, which has plants in Lynwood and Oakland, has 2,100 employees and 
operations throughout the country. Kilsby-Roberts' California operations are 
located in the City of Industry and Hayward. The Brea firm and a subsidiary 
employ nearly 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective new owner of the two firms does not plan any layoffs or plant 
closings. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said the managers and employees at Jorgensen and Kilsby-Roberts would be 
given the option of acquiring 20% to 30% of the equity in the merged company 
through an employee stock ownership plan. But an ESOP would not be used to 
finance the acquisition, he said. Kelso already has financing commitments, he 
said.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has granted a small Virginia 
company the right to do research and development for using spent space shuttle 
fuel tanks as a platform for military, civilian and commercial experiments. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed with Global Outpost of Alexandria, is the first for using 
the 154-foot-long tanks, which now are destroyed in their plunge through the 
atmosphere. The tanks carry the 528,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen that carry the shuttle into orbit. 
</P>

LEASING FIRM ORDERS JETS WORTH UP TO $5.2 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

International Lease Finance, a major aircraft-leasing firm based in Beverly 
Hills, said Tuesday that it has ordered 42 airliners worth $1.9 billion from 
Airbus Industrie, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing and placed options for 67 
additional planes worth $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it ordered 15 jetliners each from Boeing and McDonnell 
Douglas, and 12 from Airbus, the European consortium. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new orders and options, International Lease said it 
exercised $1.055 billion worth of options for 24 Boeing jetliners, including 19 
narrow-body 737s. International Lease acquired the options in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's order is unusual for International Lease because it consists mainly 
of options. Normally, firm orders dominate the company's aircraft purchase 
plans. Buyers ordinarily pay a manufacturer less when they take an option than 
when they place a firm order; if they decide later to go ahead with the 
purchase, the option is converted to an order. 
</P>
<P>
Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, said the emphasis on 
options reflects recent uncertainty in the airline industry caused by higher 
fuel prices, deregulation in Europe and talk in Congress of a return to 
regulation in this country. Most of the company's customers are airlines that 
prefer to lease rather than own their planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this order leaves us well-hedged and gives us maneuvering room to 
determine demand," Udvar-Hazy said. 
</P>
<P>
International Lease split its order for narrow-body aircraft between Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas. St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, which builds its 
commercial airliners at its Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, was shut 
out in 1988 when the leasing company ordered $6.6 billion worth of planes from 
Boeing and Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seattle-based Boeing stands to get the lion's share of Tuesday's 
narrow-body order if all the options are exercised. 
</P>
<P>
Udvar-Hazy said the company decided to order the 15 McDonnell Douglas 
twin-engine MD-90s and take options on 15 more because the company already has 
a large number of Douglas MD-80s in its fleet, and "we felt we needed something 
to succeed the MD-80s going into the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The MD-90 orders and options will give a boost for the Douglas jet, whose only 
other customers so far are Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines. The plane is 
early in its development stage, and the first one would be delivered to 
International Lease in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The firm orders for the McDonnell Douglas planes were worth $565 million, and 
the options totaled $560 million. 
</P>
<P>
International Lease ordered eight Boeing 737s and took options on 24 others 
because, Udvar-Hazy said, the aircraft is popular with many customers. 
International Lease took options on a total of 48 Boeing aircraft, including 
747s, 767s and 757s. The company said the firm orders were worth $795 million, 
and the new options were worth $2.59 billion. International Lease said delivery 
would begin in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
From Airbus Industrie, International Lease ordered 12 A321-100s worth $510 
million and placed options for four more, worth $170 million, for delivery in 
1995.

GORBACHEV RUMORS PUSH MARKET LOWER

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jolted by a news report that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might resign as 
Soviet Communist Party chief, the stock market closed broadly lower Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The unconfirmed report by Cable News Network around 2 p.m. EST said Gorbachev 
may step down as party leader but retain his post as president, "produced a 
technical bounce in the market. It was jerking all over the lot," said Michael 
Metz, technical analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials finished the session 10.14 points lower 
at 2,543.24 after flip-flopping throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outpaced advancers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,156 issues down, 399 up and 431 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 186.03 million shares, up from 150.77 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the report about Gorbachev's possible resignation on Cable News 
Network caused reactions throughout the financial markets. Stock prices became 
so volatile shortly after the 2 p.m. EST report that traders at one investment 
brokerage stopped trading temporarily until the market calmed down. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which was heading lower during the afternoon, intensified its slide 
after the news report. Off more than 27 points at 2:30 p.m., the average jumped 
back into the plus column briefly before finishing lower at the close. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a market of this kind for some time. It's pulsating, vibrating 
without any sense of direction," said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst 
for MKI Securities Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Gorbachev report, interest rates and concern about financing for 
takeovers remained the market's chief worries. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market also interpreted remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan before the Joint Economic Committee in Washington as a sign that 
the central bank would not reduce interest rates any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the probability of a recession is less than 50%, lower than 
previously anticipated, and that the current rate of inflation is 
"unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications stocks were among the losers Tuesday, with MCI 
Communications reporting the biggest hit, losing 3 1/8 to close at 31 1/4 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Though MCI's fourth-quarter earnings were somewhat less than some analysts had 
expected, they still brought 1989 profit to a record $529 million, up from $334 
million in 1988. Annual revenue increased to $6.47 billion, up from $5.14 
billion. This led some market analysts to portray the drop as more symptomatic 
of the market's current skittishness than of investor disappointment in 
telecommunications stocks. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the common stock of both American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
and United Telecommunications fell. AT&amp;T finished off 1 3/4 at 37 3/4; 
Kansas City-based United, parent of U S Sprint and local phone companies, fell 
1 7/8 at 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, Tokyo stocks squeezed out moderate gains as the market 
tried to rally after recent losses. The key 225-share Nikkei index rose 41.97 
points to close at 37,215.67. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks fell slightly in thin trading , hurt by weakness on Wall 
Street. The Financial Times 100-share index was down 6.9 points to 2,321.9 at 
the close. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bonds Benefit From Market's Unease 
</P>
<P>
Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds surged following the report that Gorbachev was 
considering resigning as Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Government bonds, which had been down as much as 3/8 point, boomeranged after 
the mid-afternoon report and finished with gains of up to 1/4 point. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond finished 9/32 higher, a gain of 
about $2.81 per $1,000 face amount. That pushed the yield down to 8.55% from 
8.57% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market, which declined sharply last Friday and again Monday, 
stabilized Tuesday because of a recovery in the price of high-yield RJR Nabisco 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If the Gorbachev report turns out to be true, "the market effects will not be 
lasting," speculated Bob Sbarra, senior vice president at Carroll McEntee &amp; 
McGinley Inc. Such a resignation would merely mirror events elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe, where some leaders have resigned from Communist parties but 
hung on to government positions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasuries had weakened in the morning following Greenspan's Congressional 
testimony in which the Federal Reserve chairman warned that inflation remained 
unacceptably high and said that the risk of recession had eased. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was at 8.25%, unchanged from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the corporate bond market, prices of high-yield issues, or junk bonds, 
steadied after two days of big declines. A recovery in the price of bonds 
issued by RJR Nabisco Inc., the bellwether for the market, helped stabilize 
prices, said Alan Schlesinger, head of junk bond trading at Donaldson, Lufkin 
&amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco's 13.71% bonds due 2007 rose about 3 7/8 to 63 1/2 and its 13.71% 
bonds due 2009 rose about 2 7/8 to 68 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Posts Gains; Gold Prices Mixed 
</P>
<P>
The dollar jumped in panicky trading on the Gorbachev rumors. Gold prices were 
mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold fell $1 to close at 
$418.10. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $418.30 an ounce, up 10 
cents from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar soared to a high of 146 yen from 142.98 yen late Monday 
and to 1.7130 West German marks from 1.6770 marks the day before. The dollar 
eased somewhat by late afternoon but did not give up all its gains. 
</P>
<P>
"It reached panic proportions," said Mike Ballow, a currency markets analyst 
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Plummets on Tight Supply News 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures prices fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange after a rally prompted by a reduced world production forecast 
sputtered and failed. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures fell; energy futures were 
mostly lower; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and precious metal futures 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures settled 0.36 to 0.46 cent lower, with the contract for delivery 
in March down 0.43 cent at 14.44 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The market rallied strongly early in the session after the West German 
statistical firm F. O. Licht released a revised 1989-90 world sugar production 
forecast of 106.5 million metric tons, about 1.2 million tons below its 
previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Licht said crops in several countries had not lived up to expectations, and the 
resulting tightening of supplies created the potential for explosive upward 
price movement if a large consumer country such as the Soviet Union, China or 
India were to enter the world market as a buyer.

America West Airlines: The Phoenix-based airline said 1989 profit more than 
doubled from 1988 to a record $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 28% to $993.4 million. For the fourth quarter, the airline 
reported profit of $1.15 million, compared to net income of $19.1 million a 
year earlier. The quarterly figures were affected by a $2.7-million gain in the 
1989 period from the sale of certain foreign tax benefits related to the 
acquisition of aircraft and $16.6 million of extraordinary items resulting from 
a debenture exchange in the 1988 quarter. The company said increases in fuel 
prices also affected results.

Pacific Enterprises, parent of Southern California Gas Co. and the Thrifty 
drugstore chain, said Tuesday that its 1989 net income fell 5% because of 
higher interest costs on money borrowed for acquisitions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company posted net income of $211 million on revenue of 
$6.76 billion, compared to 1988 net income of $222 million on revenue of $5.93 
billion. The 1988 net income figure included $16 million from the sale of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income after taxes rose 7% to $349 million in 1989 from $326 million 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, net income inched up to $42 million from $41 million in 
the same period of 1988. Pacific Enterprises reported revenue of $1.78 billion, 
compared to $1.59 billion in the 1988 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises' higher operating income was offset by a 13% increase in 
interest expense, which totaled $120 million in 1989. However, the company's 
efforts to reduce debt paid off in the fourth quarter as interest expense fell 
to $30 million, a $4-million decrease from the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises made three major acquisitions in 1988: the $339-million 
purchase of Sabine Corp., a Dallas-based oil and gas exploration firm; the 
$234-million purchase of a drugstore chain and a membership discount store 
chain in the Pacific Northwest, and the $93-million purchase of mineral rights 
for oil and gas exploration on a Texas ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas, the nation's largest natural gas distribution utility, 
recorded 1989 operating income of $215 million, up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifty Corp. saw operating income rise 3% to $68 million for its fiscal year. 
(Thrifty's fiscal year ended Nov. 30 while the parent company and all other 
Pacific Enterprises subsidiaries operate on a fiscal year that ended Dec. 31.) 
Thrifty operates more than 1,000 drugstores and sporting goods stores under a 
variety of names, including Big 5 Sporting Goods in California. 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific Enterprises Oil, operating income leaped 46% to $51 million because 
of higher oil prices and greater oil and gas production.

Revenue totaled $2.25 billion, up 11%. For 1989, the Atlanta firm's profit

results were also attributed to a 10% rise in sales of concentrates and syrups.

FORD MAY TAKE $500-MILLION CHARGE

Ford Motor Co. disclosed Tuesday that it may take a charge of up to $500 
million against 1989 earnings because it sold its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary 
for less than book value. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford also said it is 
projecting North American production for the first quarter of 1990 to be off 
25% from the same period in 1989, following a 13% decline in the quarter just 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
Ford also said it would increase borrowings "substantially" this year because 
of two recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures came in a filing by a wholly owned Ford subsidiary, Ford Motor 
Credit Co., seeking SEC permission to offer $2 billion in debt securities from 
time to time over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Credit provides wholesale financing and capital loans to franchised 
Ford dealers and makes loans to vehicle leasing companies. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the SEC's required disclosure to potential investors, the 
registration filing revealed several situations at the parent company: 
</P>
<P>
* Ford's Dec. 15, 1989, sale of all the outstanding stock of Rouge Steel Co. to 
Marico Acquisition Corp. "was below book value. The amount of the charge to net 
income has not yet been determined, but could range up to $500 million for the 
fourth quarter and full year 1989." 
</P>
<P>
* Marico was merged into Rouge Steel and Ford acquired 20% in the resulting 
corporation but also is committed to indemnify Rouge Steel for "environmental 
matters" prior to the sale. "Ford is unable at this time to determine the 
amount of its potential responsibility for such environmental matters; however, 
such costs could be substantial." 
</P>
<P>
* On Jan. 12, Ford announced plans to sell Ford Aerospace but "it is uncertain 
when, or at what price, such sale may occur." 
</P>
<P>
* The acquisition of Associates, a major consumer loan concern, and Jaguar PLC, 
the British luxury car maker, "have used and will continue to use substantial 
amounts of available cash. Consequently, it is anticipated that Ford and its 
affiliates will substantially increase borrowings in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
* Ford estimated its North American vehicle production in the fourth quarter of 
1989 was "13% below the fourth quarter of 1988."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A RETRIAL BY TV TALK SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE PARENTS OF FORMER MCMARTIN PRESCHOOL STUDENTS NOW HAVE A FORUM 
TO RETRY THE MOLESTATION CASE THEY LOST IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner did not drop charges against five of seven 
people accused of molesting children attending the McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach. There was never a McMartin trial that lasted 2 1/2 years. 
There was never a McMartin verdict acquiting the remaining two defendants of 52 
counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was all a dream. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the impression you get these days from watching some of 
television, where former McMartin students and their parents have succeeded at 
last in doing what they have been unable to do in the courts: 
</P>
<P>
Convict the McMartin defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the news media have acknowledged their own lack of restraint in the 
early days of McMartin, when much of the coverage indelibly branded the 
defendants guilty before they had their day in court. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now -- after that day in court -- the same thing is happening again, with 
some elements of the media fostering a dangerous atmosphere of vigilantism by 
helping rev up public opinion against the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
After a Superior Court jury 13 days ago acquitted Raymond Buckey and his 
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of those 52 counts of child molestation, the 
alleged young victims and their parents became a sizzling TV ticket, and a 
number of them immediately hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of TV? Exploit the case's publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the McMartin case figures? Exploit TV. Their aim has been to use TV 
to retry the case -- this time in their favor -- and to demand another trial 
for Raymond Buckey on the 13 molestation charges against him on which the jury 
deadlocked. Prosecutors are expected to decide this week what they will do 
about those. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to win the traditional way, the children and their parents have 
been arguing their case in the courtroom of TV talk shows, where 
cross-examination is usually minimal and emotion takes precedence over 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
That's their right. It's the American way. Didn't Zsa Zsa Gabor take her case 
to the talk shows after she lost in court? As always, however, the burden of 
restraint and fairness is mostly not on those wishing to exploit the medium, 
but on those responsible for keeping order in the TV court, the TV 
entrepreneurs themselves. It's their gavel to rap. 
</P>
<P>
Uh oh, big trouble here. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most ambitious of TV's post-McMartin retrials was Monday's episode 
of "Geraldo,' which was taped a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The show's New York stage and studio were packed with former McMartin students 
and their parents -- all aggressively opposed to the verdicts. Participating by 
satellite from Los Angeles were original -- and now exonerated -- defendant 
Peggy Ann Buckey, two McMartin jurors and a former McMartin student and her 
mother, who contended that the children weren't molested by anyone connected 
with the school. Also in Los Angeles was KCBS-TV reporter Harvey Levin, who for 
this occasion was designated as a sort of Geraldo West. 
</P>
<P>
Give Rivera credit at least for a semblance of fairness, for saying that he 
didn't believe "one way or another" and for noting some of the legalities of 
the case that were being eclipsed by emotional rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
But his show was inevitably tilted in favor of the molestation charges. It's 
hard to overestimate the impact of a boy looking at the camera and telling a 
nation largely unfamiliar with the details of the case: "We were molested, and 
that's an honest-to-God fact." 
</P>
<P>
The bias went much deeper, however. For one thing, there was the overwhelming 
numerical advantage for the children and parents. For another, there was their 
overwhelming technological advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the studio with Rivera could both see and hear everyone in Los 
Angeles, but those on the Los Angeles side of the satellite connection could 
only hear the New York side. That was a critical disadvantage, in effect 
isolating the TV-inexperienced Buckey and two jurors and putting them in the 
position of being outsiders trying to crash a closed club. 
</P>
<P>
Those presenting their case in New York did so without interruption, and 
sometimes to applause. When Buckey spoke, she was frequently interrupted and 
challenged by the group in New York, whom she could not see. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, in responding to old, but unproved charges that the accused 
molesters were involved in satanism, Buckey demanded to hear "one shred of 
evidence." Back in New York, Rivera began to address that, only to become 
sidetracked. He never returned to it, hence the satanism charge stood. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, juror Danny L. Kindle in Los Angeles said he would have found 
Raymond Buckey guilty of molestation under the lower standards of evidence 
required for a civil case. But just as juror Mark Bassett began to give his 
opinion -- a man whose previous statements on the show indicated he generally 
disbelieved the students' accusations -- the show switched back to New York and 
he never got to speak. Thus, the first juror's statement was inscribed in 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
Even in trying to address child molestation trials as a generic issue, the show 
was overwhelmingly concerned with the ordeal of the children caught up in the 
McMartin case. No one would reject that as a legitimate concern. But what about 
the ordeal of the seven original defendants, especially Buckey and his mother, 
who each spent years in jail? 
</P>
<P>
That question was not addressed on "Geraldo." Nor was it addressed on two 
earlier TV retrials of the case, on "Oprah" and "Sally Jessy Raphael." Compared 
to them, "Geraldo" was as judicious as the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller number of former McMartin students and their parents were on stage in 
Oprah Winfrey's Chicago studio along with Greg Mooney, the attorney who 
represents many of the McMartin families, and Colleen Mooney, director of the 
South Bay Center for Counseling, which treated some of the McMartin children. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by satellite from Los Angeles -- and as electronically disadvantaged 
as the satellite guests on "Geraldo" -- were McMartin Judge William Pounders 
and Brenda Williams, the most articulate of the McMartin jurors who have gone 
public after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The level of fairness here was typified by Winfrey's admission that she would 
have made a poor McMartin juror because "I would say, 'The children said it; 
all right, you're right.' " The studio audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey's show is a perfect vehicle for emotions, which she brings out with 
great sincerity. That's her strength. Yet her show has difficulty reaching the 
stories beneath the surface tears, and, like much of TV, it strips away nuances 
and tailors complexities to its own time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey to a former McMartin student: "What did you tell the jury?" That's 
right, capsulize 16 days of testimony in a few sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Again to the same student: "How old were you when all of these things allegedly 
happened?" And now to the student's mother: "How did you at first find out that 
something was allegedly going on at the school?" 
</P>
<P>
Using allegedly here was like trying to mend decapitation with a Band-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
Of all of TV's talk show hosts, Winfrey is perhaps the least inclined to play 
devil's advocate. She could have asked Pounders about the propriety of his 
multiple talk show appearances, but didn't. She could have demanded evidence 
when one of her guests accused McMartin defendants of "terrorist tactics," but 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that she, her studio audience and the McMartin kids and their 
parents were on the same side. There were frequent shots of the audience, 
shaking their heads in disbelief at hearing -- for the first time, it seemed -- 
charges of sexual molestation. One woman angrily told Winfrey: "I am thoroughly 
outraged at this verdict!" Winfrey could have asked her how she could be 
outraged when she hadn't seen the evidence, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Even less calm heads prevailed on "Sally Jessy Raphael," an hour born of 
ignorance and hosted from ignorance. Raphael sounded like she heard about the 
case on the way to work. When someone mentioned Raymond Buckey's attorney, 
Danny Davis, she asked, "Who's that?" 
</P>
<P>
She did know who Dean R. Gits (Peggy McMartin Buckey's attorney) was, though, 
because he was available by phone to answer some of the charges being made in 
the studio by McMartin kids and their parents. It was a mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while Gits was speaking, his photograph filled half the screen 
while the other half was occupied by a live shot of a former McMartin student 
negatively reacting to him. Not fair. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael did have McMartin juror Sally Cordova on stage to answer -- to the 
audience and Raphael -- for her actions in voting to acquit on 52 charges. This 
wasn't a program, it was an assassination of the defendants, with Raphael's 
face freezing in shock at the alleged molestation horrors she was hearing, as 
if this was all news to her. 
</P>
<P>
After one McMartin parent urged sympathetic viewers to write Reiner and 
Pounders to urge them to retry Raymond Buckey on the 13 remaining counts, the 
addresses for both men magically appeared on the screen, firmly placing Raphael 
and her show in the position of advocate. 
</P>
<P>
What a disgusting performance. McMartin: Not only the longest-running criminal 
trial, but also the longest-running circus.

APPEALS COURT REMOVES BAN ON HIDDEN CAMERA; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: 'INSIDE EDITION' ATTORNEYS HAIL DECISION AS A VICTORY FOR TV 
JOURNALISTS' FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. DISPUTED FOOTAGE WILL BE AIRED THURSDAY.

<P>
In a case that has ramifications for TV news-gathering techniques, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati has removed a temporary restraining order 
preventing the broadcast of a hidden-camera interview on the syndicated 
magazine show "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
But the decision, while prohibiting the blocking of the disputed footage, did 
not address other issues about hidden-camera interviews in TV news. Those 
issues are likely to be pursued in other legal action. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Edition" had been blocked from airing a hidden-camera interview with a 
New York physician that was obtained by a producer posing as a patient. The 
hidden-camera interview was part of an investigation of Dr. Stuart Berger, a 
best-selling diet-book author whose nutrition therapies have been 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Edition" plans to air the disputed footage in a follow-up story 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Berger has filed suit against King World, the producer of "Inside Edition," and 
plans to pursue his case on the grounds that "Inside Edition" violated federal 
wiretapping laws and trespassed on his private property. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for King World hailed the appeals court's decision Monday as a 
victory for the First Amendment rights of TV journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"The appeals court has said that Dr. Berger does not have the right to stop the 
show," Martin Garbus, an attorney representing King World, said in an 
interview. "Prior restraint of publication is not permitted under the 
Constitution except on grounds of national security." 
</P>
<P>
"Reporters have always gone into places undercover in pursuit of the truth," 
said Av Westin, senior vice president for King World and executive producer of 
"Inside Edition." "The appeals court decision simply upholds a long-established 
protection for journalists in legitimate pursuits that the public can benefit 
from." 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Edition" last week was prevented from airing its hidden-camera 
interview by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Hackett in Detroit. Hackett 
ruled that "Inside Edition" had violated the federal wiretapping law by 
obtaining the sequence with Berger without his consent or knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The case was said to be the first time that a judge had successfully imposed 
prior restraint on a nationally televised series. The report about Berger that 
"Inside Edition" aired last week did not include the hidden-camera segment, in 
which producer Amy Wasserstrom visited the doctor's office, posing as a patient 
seeking his medical advice. Berger is currently under investigation by the New 
York State Health Department Office of Professional Medical Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court in Cincinnati held that the Detroit court "clearly erred in 
its interpretation of First Amendment law." But it noted that the decision was 
"not intended to constitute an approval of the surreptitious means used to 
gather this information about Berger." 
</P>
<P>
"All they've said is that we can't stop them (King World) from airing the 
show," Russell Ethridge, an attorney for Berger, said in an interview. "But 
that doesn't affect the validity of our other claims." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ethridge, Berger's attorneys were considering asking the U.S. 
Supreme Court to continue the restraining order, although it did not seem 
likely that any such action could be taken before the scheduled broadcast on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for King World contend that what they did was not illegal under New 
York state law, which allows such taping if one party consents to the act. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled for Friday to determine whether the case will be moved 
from Detroit to New York. Although he practices medicine in New York, Berger 
had sought the injunction in Detroit, his attorneys said, because he has 
business dealings there. King World has wanted the case moved to New York, 
where "Inside Edition" is produced and where First Amendment cases regularly 
are tried.

DGA NOMINATIONS FURTHER MUDDLE OSCAR RACE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTORS GUILD REMEMBERS SPRING/SUMMER FILMS FOR ITS TOP AWARD BUT 
FORGETS SPIKE LEE AND PAUL MAZURSKY. 
</P>

<P>
The ad line that Universal Pictures has been using in its Oscar campaign for 
Phil Alden Robinson's "Field of Dreams," a fantasy baseball-theme picture 
released last spring, is "Remember the feeling." Enough members of the 
Directors Guild of America remembered to give Robinson the feeling of being a 
nominee for the DGA's 1989 best-director award. 
</P>
<P>
Enough members also remembered "Dead Poets Society" and "When Harry Met Sally," 
two early summer releases, to put their directors -- Peter Weir and Rob Reiner 
-- on a list that also included previous DGA winners Woody Allen ("Crimes and 
Misdemeanors") and Oliver Stone ("Born on the Fourth of July"). 
</P>
<P>
Weir was a previous DGA nominee in 1985 for "Witness." Reiner was nominated for 
the 1986 "Stand By Me." Allen won the award in 1977 for "Annie Hall" and was a 
subsequent nominee for both "Manhattan" in 1979 and "Hannah and Her Sisters" in 
1986. Stone won in 1987 for "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
The DGA, the bulk of whose 9,000 members are not feature-film directors, has 
had a spotty record of presaging the full list of nominations made by the 
directors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But it has 
been nearly perfect in aligning its winner with the eventual Oscar winner. Only 
three times in the 41-year history of the DGA awards has the guild's winner not 
gone on to win the Academy Award as well. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, veteran Oscar watchers have been calling this one of the most 
wide-open races in years, and Tuesday's announcement, made by 1988 winner Barry 
Levinson ("Rain Man"), did little to put it into focus. Previously honored 
directors Spike Lee (winner of the L.A. critics' best-director award for "Do 
the Right Thing"), Paul Mazursky (the New York winner for "Enemies, a Love 
Story"), Kenneth Branagh (the National Board of Review's pick for "Henry V"), 
and Gus Van Sant ("Drugstore Cowboy," selected by the National Society of Film 
Critics) were all left off the DGA list. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other directors of well-reviewed films who were overlooked by the 
DGA ("Driving Miss Daisy's" Bruce Beresford, "The War of the Roses" ' Danny 
DeVito, "Glory's" Ed Zwick, "sex, lies, and videotape's" Steven Soderbergh, 
"Music Box's" Costa-Gavras) are still in the running for Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
Of this year's DGA slate, only Oliver Stone seems certain to be among the 
academy's best-director nominees. Oscar nominations will be announced Feb. 14; 
balloting closes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the DGA nominations underscore the changing release patterns 
of major studios and undermine the conventional wisdom that films released 
before the fall are forgotten by winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams," the story of a corn farmer who builds a baseball field for 
his father's post-World War I idols, then watches the flanneled ghosts play 
ball, opened in March, a month that had traditionally been better for teen-age 
high-jinks movies than for those aimed at adults. It played all the way through 
the most competitive summer in history and grossed more than $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
The movie seemed to strike a nerve with audiences, especially men tweaked by 
memories of their own relationships with their fathers, and enjoyed the kind of 
word-of-mouth that made such films as "Chariots of Fire" and "Peggy Sue Got 
Married" easy to remember at awards time. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" fits the same mold. The movie, about a free-spirited 
English teacher at a conservative prep school, was a risky summer entry by 
Disney's Touchstone division but easily held its own and has grossed more than 
$94 million. The DGA nomination bodes well for both Weir and the film's star, 
Robin Williams, in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally," a romantic comedy about a couple who seem 
to prove the notion that friendships between men and women are sooner or later 
subverted by sexual attraction, was an instant box-office hit, propelled by the 
most talked-about scene of the year (Meg Ryan's faked orgasm in Katz Deli) and 
has taken in $92 million. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" divided critics and audiences but found 
enough fans within the DGA. A funny-sad meditation on the relativity of sin in 
God's eyes, it has faced the usual resistance from moviegoers to Allen films -- 
particularly those that veer into the epistemological zone. "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" has grossed just $17 million and was pretty much ignored by 
critics groups. 
</P>
<P>
Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July," adapted from the autobiography of Vietnam 
veteran Ron Kovic, is on a roll at the box office (it grossed more than $30 
million during its first month in release) and seems the odds-on favorite to 
dominate the Oscars. Stone is that rare film maker who, in one of Hollywood's 
most timid eras, has managed to both make films with heavy social themes and 
turn studio executives lightheaded with their box-office success. 
</P>
<P>
The DGA's nominations figure to be more populist than the academy, which in 
turn figures to be more populist than critics. There are 270 feature-film 
directors in the academy's directors branch, while the DGA membership includes 
directors of film and TV dramas and their assistants, directors of TV news and 
sports programs, unit production managers and stage production managers. 
</P>
<P>
The DGA will announce its nominees in TV categories next week. All 9,000 
members vote on the final ballot and the winners will be announced by Levinson 
at the guild's annual dinner March 10 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly 
Hills.

BLACK DANCERS STRESS UNITY, BUT OMINOUS NOTE IS SOUNDED;

DANCE: A VETERAN CHOREOGRAPHER WARNS DELEGATES AT A DENVER CONFERENCE THAT THEY 
ARE 'FACING EXTINCTION.'

<P>
Like a bubbly camp counselor, Cleo Parker Robinson welcomed a roomful of 
delegates to the third annual International Conference of Black Dance Companies 
last weekend. As dance pioneer Katherine Dunham sat regally nearby, Robinson 
(host of the event) invited the dancers, choreographers, administrators and 
journalists to stand and introduce themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They had come from all corners of the country -- and from as far away as Peru 
and Bermuda -- to meet and discuss the plentiful problems of being a black 
dancer in the '90s. Everyone knew that sources for funding were drying up, that 
arts of all colors were struggling for audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was a joyful sense of togetherness in the room, as each 
introduction was made. Then, Eleo Pomare stood. 
</P>
<P>
His head shaven, sporting a single earring, the veteran choreographer looked 
like a relic from the '60s -- which he is. "Black dancers," he said slowly, 
emphatically, "must realize that we are all facing extinction." 
</P>
<P>
Pomare punctuated each word by pounding the table with a pen. An uncomfortable 
silence fell on the room. As Robinson noted later on: "Eleo came (to Denver) 
almost feeling that there was no use in our coming together." 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, the conference presented a rave-up "Salute to the Masters," 
honoring in words, slides and performance the contributions of Dunham and three 
other pivotal figures in dance: Arthur Mitchell (who also attended), Pearl 
Primus (who didn't), and the late Alvin Ailey. 
</P>
<P>
During intermission, Pomare puffed on a cigarette near a doorway and quietly 
expanded on his ominous warning: "It's a simple case of racism. The arts world 
will allow a thousand Merce Cunninghams and a thousand Twyla Tharps -- but 
there's only room for one Alvin Ailey. That's all they will allow." 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that the 200 dance makers assembled in Denver were probably in no mood 
for such strong political talk, Pomare shrugged and said, "I am brutally 
truthful." 
</P>
<P>
If the weekend of classes, workshops, performances, panel discussions and 
partying proved one thing, it is that political viewpoints are as plentiful as 
dance styles. 
</P>
<P>
On one end of the spectrum was the contagious energy of Robinson and the North 
Carolina-based, African-influenced Chuck Davis. Each spoke rapturously of the 
joy in discovering one another. 
</P>
<P>
On the other philosophical end stood Pomare and, to an extent, Dunham, who 
noted that this was "a wretched, miserable period in the history of mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also acknowledged Pomare's warning, but added that "this wasn't a 
political time" for those at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point where we need to be rooted," she said. "We really must come 
together, now that the arts have become so decentralized." She said that Joan 
Myers Brown of Philadanco in Philadelphia created this conference three years 
ago to deal with the problems of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to empower ourselves. . . . Gradually, we will develop a mechanism, 
so that at the next conference (in Dayton, Ohio) and the one after that (hosted 
by Lula Washington in Los Angeles) we can work from a stronger political 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, at least, the tone was strictly celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening-night "Salute to the Masters," Ailey dancer April Berry 
performed an excerpt from Dunham's "L'Ag'Ya." Renee Robinson, another Ailey 
product, honored the late choreographer by dancing his solo "Cry." To wrap up 
the evening, a cast of dozens led by the irrepressible Davis danced a West 
African "Tribute to the Elders," accompanied by an army of drummers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the "elders" -- including Mitchell, Primus' son Onwin, veteran dancers 
Joe Nash and Walter Nix and Ailey school director Denise Jefferson -- got into 
the act, to the delight of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
A series of classes and discussions took up most of the second day, culminating 
in another celebratory performance. That night, a showcase concert was held at 
the new facility that serves as home base for Robinson's company: an old 
African Methodist church standing proudly in near darkness across the street 
from a brightly lit shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
The significant role of youth was acknowledged by Dunham, as she countered 
Pomare's warning at the opening session. Young blacks, she cautioned, "must 
understand that there is always someone working against Up harder than you are 
working against Down. You know, I spent a good deal of my miserable childhood 
looking out the window at a star." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the four "masters," Robinson said, "None of them survived by 
dwelling on the negative. What we all need is time" -- a point seconded earlier 
in the conference by Dunham, who last summer announced that she had turned 80. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can get over the first 60 or 70 years," she told the delegates, "you 
can make it."

FAMILY PLANNING BILL PUTS HEAT ON GOVERNOR

<P>
Under pressure from Sen. Pete Wilson and other Republicans to defuse a volatile 
political issue, Gov. George Deukmejian today will announce the fate of a 
$20-million family planning bill that has caused him deep anger and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP governor has until midnight to act on a handful of options involving 
the popular legislation, which would restore money he previously vetoed for 500 
clinics serving mostly poor women. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian can fan the political fires by either vetoing the measure or using 
his gubernatorial blue pencil to pare the $20 million to a lower figure. Both 
courses, Republicans fear, could expose them to the attacks of increasingly 
vocal abortion-rights activists, because critics of family planning have linked 
the clinics with abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The way for Deukmejian to please most Republicans running for office this year 
-- including the pro-choice Wilson -- is either to sign the bill or allow it to 
become law without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just fed up with the whole thing," said one Deukmejian aide, who like 
most insiders did not want to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has publicly voiced his anger at a lawsuit challenging his authority 
to cut money for family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
A San Luis Obispo County Superior Court judge ordered restoration of the funds, 
but the governor has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. To now 
sign a bill restoring the money would make him look as if he were surrendering 
to the plaintiffs and set a bad precedent for future governors, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also has publicly attacked the family planning clinics themselves, 
declaring they provide far more medical services than the Legislature 
originally envisioned. He insists that these benefits are available separately 
from the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
More than 31,000 low-income women in Orange County use family planning 
agencies, according to Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned 
Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Seigle said the state provides $1.4 million a year to six family planning 
outlets in the county. The outlets include the Planned Parenthood system, the 
Huntington Beach Community Clinic, Laguna Beach Community Clinic and the Orange 
County Center for Health. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, according to people close to him, Deukmejian also thinks the whole 
issue has been greatly overblown by the Legislature. The program represents 
just a minuscule part of a $50-billion state budget, he reasons. And Deukmejian 
really resents being pressured. 
</P>
<P>
But politically, Deukmejian's arguments will not wash with middle-of-the-road 
voters, many leading Republicans contend. They fear -- and they have told the 
governor -- that Democrats will have a field day accusing the GOP of 
insensitivity for cutting back such services as birth-control advice and 
prescriptions, gynecological examinations, pregnancy tests, and screening for 
venereal disease and AIDS for the 470,000 people who used the nonprofit clinics 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor ought to get rid of this thing. It's a loser," said one 
strategist for Wilson, the probable Republican nominee to replace Deukmejian 
next January. "The governor knows where we're coming from on this. Pete feels 
he ought to restore the family planning money. We're not seeking fights with 
Duke, but Republicans are getting killed with this kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson adviser, who requested anonymity, added that if Democrats attempt to 
tar Wilson with an anti-family planning brush because of what Deukmejian does, 
"Pete can always say, 'Well, this candidate would be a different kind of 
Republican governor.' But he would prefer not to have to say it. So there's 
been a lot of communication" with Deukmejian aides. 
</P>
<P>
What makes family planning especially volatile politically is that it is linked 
indirectly with abortion, perhaps the hottest campaign issue of the last few 
months, at least in California. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Republicans in the Assembly originally opposed the family planning 
programs because they believed many clinics promoted abortion. During a budget 
crunch last July, Deukmejian went along with their objections and vetoed $24 
million from the state's $36-million funding package for the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
But his action was taken before voters began seriously contemplating a landmark 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling, just a few days earlier, that gave states greater 
leeway to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole abortion issue is like a dagger at Republicans," said former 
Deukmejian chief-of-staff Steven A. Merksamer, who now is a private attorney 
and a part-time Wilson adviser. "The Supreme Court made it a real issue. A lot 
of people who were indifferent before the ruling have become activists. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of another issue that tends to make politicians throw up as fast 
as abortion, because whatever position you take you are going to alienate a 
vociferous single-issue constituency and do political damage to yourself," 
Merksamer said. "And that's something politicians try to avoid at all cost." 
</P>
<P>
Merksamer, like most of Deukmejian's advisers, hopes the governor somehow can 
protect the constitutional separation of powers, rid himself of the political 
issue and also save face. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the governor's concern about his line-item veto authority," he 
said. "But, hopefully this issue can be resolved in a way that preserves his 
authority and at the same time gets this issue behind him and the Legislature 
so they can get on with the broader issues that confront this state." 
</P>
<P>
That is the message Republican legislative leaders have been sending 
Deukmejian. They also have been reminding the governor that GOP and Democratic 
legislators negotiated the compromise family planning bill under the 
cooperative, watchful eye of his Administration. And now they feel the governor 
has pulled the rug out from under them. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes you can push the governor too much," noted Senate Republican 
Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William J. Filante (R-Greenbrae), one of the GOP legislators 
pushing for family planning funds, said he admires the governor for being "a 
very straight person, squeaky clean, who has the guts to look at something and 
give it his best shot and do what he believes in. . . . He's not acting on the 
basis of who's for it and who's against it."

STUDY OF LATINOS STIRS MIXED REACTIONS 
</P>

The Orange County Latino Assessment Study, a two-year survey by the Tomas 
Rivera Center in Claremont, drew both praise and criticism from Latino 
community representatives Tuesday at a briefing after the benchmark study was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"We know our community has a dropout problem," said Kathy Jurado, a marketing 
director for Operation SER (Service Employment Redevelopment), a job training 
agency in Santa Ana. "We know that the poor do not have adequate health 
insurance and that they don't vote. I wanted the study to explain what is 
causing these things." 
</P>
<P>
Jurado and other Latinos at the briefing in the county human relations office 
took exception to the study's "broad consensus" of describing Latinos as "poor 
and uneducated dropouts," with no explanations or recommendations to overcome 
the social problem. 
</P>
<P>
Nativo Lopez, an immigrants' rights advocate with Hermandad Mexicana Nacional 
in Santa Ana, objected to a recommendation that funding organizations pay 
special attention to minority coalitions rather than agencies offering direct 
help to the poor. Lopez called that attitude "a form of racism." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency among foundations to fund large coalition groups and not 
give funding to agencies who give direct help to Latino poor," Lopez said. 
"Rather than a coalition, they should be giving money to immigrants who have 
developed their own leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Most community leaders said they were concerned that the county's 
decision-makers, major funding corporations and foundations might accept the 
study at face value, with little room for added input. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 major county corporations and foundations, and another 200 
individuals regarded as major decision-makers, are on the center's distribution 
list, said Arturo Madrid, president of the Tomas Rivera Center. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid said the study's purpose is only to gather opinions from the county's 
Latino community. "That is what we were commissioned to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dominguez, an Orange County businessman and representative of the United 
Way's Hispanic Council of Orange County, helped the center select the county 
community leaders surveyed.

DIANNE KLEIN: CURIOUS CASE OF FROGS LEGGING IT FOR PARTS UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's the latest environmental crisis? 
</P>
<P>
Frogs! Toads! Salamanders and other slime! They're missing. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is what the herpetologists say and as far as I'm concerned, 
anybody who would voluntarily call himself a herpetologist cannot be dismissed 
too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
The Herps, you see, are getting together in three weeks at the National Academy 
of Sciences' UC Irvine facility to ponder the mystery. They say they don't know 
why the amphibians are going AWOL, just that they are. 
</P>
<P>
This has got me to thinking hard about amphibians, trying to remember the last 
time I had a close encounter with one. There was that blind date in high school 
and a press conference by Newt Gingrich, but other than that, I've been drawing 
a blank. 
</P>
<P>
Just as I was beginning to suspect that, gulp, it might really be Croak City, 
out of the blue came a lead. 
</P>
<P>
A reader, a credible source in the past, wrote to complain about frogs flopping 
around in potholes over by the airport construction site. This reader wanted me 
on the case. He spoke of the county's negligence and safety hazards and the 
possibility of a class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time I checked it out -- and believe me, given my heightened 
amphibian awareness it wasn't long -- the potholes had been paved over. 
</P>
<P>
You guessed it. The frogs were missing. 
</P>
<P>
By now I could see that this was getting serious. I decided to call a serious 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that Allan Shoenherr, a herpetologist at Fullerton College, has his 
own deep concerns about amphibians. Lately he hasn't seen enough of the right 
amphibians, he says, as in our kind of amphibians, the natives. 
</P>
<P>
He says the California red-legged frog, the foothill and mountain yellow-legged 
frogs, not to mention the estimable Western spadefoot toad, are but fond 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Juan Creek used to flow to the ocean," Shoenherr told me. "There were 
frogs all along there. . . . And then there were all those salamanders living 
in oak trees. Here in Orange County, when they go into places like Coto de 
Caza, what happens to the salamanders?" 
</P>
<P>
I waited for the answer to that one, but there was silence on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Try driving up into Silverado or Modjeska canyon at night, in the rain," 
Shoenherr said. 
</P>
<P>
I thought this punishment was a tad harsh for missing just one question on the 
professor's pop quiz, but before I could voice my objection, Shoenherr went on. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot less human disturbance up there," he said. "You should be able 
to see salamanders there. You might be able to see them on the roads. Now, do 
you think you would find that in Coto de Caza?" 
</P>
<P>
OK, I thought I knew the answer this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coto de Caza is a gated community," I said. "There's no way they're going to 
let me in to drive around at night in the rain." 
</P>
<P>
That about took care of the salamanders. But before the professor and I wrapped 
things up, he let me know about one more menace on the local amphibian scene -- 
we'd already gone over the usual travesties associated with unbridled 
development -- and frankly, I wasn't quite ready for what I was about to hear. 
</P>
<P>
The African clawed frog. 
</P>
<P>
This is no joke, the prof says. Scientists imported the African clawed frogs to 
California in the 1940s to serve as amphibious pregnancy tests. If the frog 
ovulated after being injected with a woman's urine it meant that the woman was 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
But after the ovulating frog test fell out of favor -- it turned out later that 
any frog would do -- the Africans broke out of the lab and began colonizing the 
New World. 
</P>
<P>
Now, of course, they're everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, water officials pulled a million of them out of the San 
Joaquin Reservoir above Newport Beach. And these frogs are true slime, 
rapacious and cannibalistic, with no natural enemies. They secrete poison 
through their skin. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can stop them," wrote Timothy Branning for the National Wildlife 
Federation in 1978 after the Department of Fish and Game's first offensive 
against the beasts. 
</P>
<P>
"They eat everything. Like a swarm of aquatic locusts, they can sweep through a 
pond leaving nothing behind. With their short, stubby forearms jerking 
spasmodically, they stuff food into their gaping mouths -- fish, insects, eggs, 
tadpoles, frogs, anything within reach." 
</P>
<P>
So here's my advice. Know your local amphibians. Spend some time with them, 
maybe share a meal. 
</P>
<P>
But make sure you watch very closely. Not all frogs are good frogs. Once those 
table manners start to slip, you could be the one who's missing next.

POLICE SAY BOY'S HOUSE YIELDED STABBING CLUES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bloodhound led police to the house of a 14-year-old boy suspected of stabbing 
a neighbor to death and, once at the boy's house, investigators found physical 
evidence linking him to the crime, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Officer Robin Kapp declined to elaborate on what evidence 
was discovered. However, he said the weapon used to kill Janice L. McLean has 
not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
No motive for the slaying has been established, Kapp said. 
</P>
<P>
McLean, a 42-year-old single mother of two teen-agers, was stabbed in her bed 
about 3 a.m. Monday by an assailant who apparently entered her home in the 9100 
block of Obsidian Drive by prying open a window. She died during surgery at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor who lives five houses from McLean's said his son was the one 
arrested by police. He said he had no explanation for the incident and 
expressed hope that his son was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office will decide today whether to file 
charges against the boy, who is being held at Orange County Juvenile Hall on 
suspicion of murder, authorities said. The boy's name was not released because 
of his age. 
</P>
<P>
School officials who know the boy said they were shocked by the news. La Quinta 
High School Principal Andrew McTaggart said the boy is a freshman at the 
school. He said the youth excelled in athletics but struggled academically and 
had a problem with attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't an angel, but he wasn't a problem student either," McTaggart said. 
</P>
<P>
McLean's 15-year-old-daughter, who was at home at the time of the attack, 
attends the same high school, McTaggart said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment further on the either student. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Perry, the boy's basketball coach, said the ninth-grader is "a very gifted 
athlete, blessed with a lot of talent." He said the boy plays football as well 
as basketball and is well-liked among his teammates and other classmates. 
</P>
<P>
And at 6-foot-3, "we were expecting great things from him," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was ineligible to play in a basketball game because of poor grades, 
Perry said. McTaggart, however, said the boy's marks were improving. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, McLean's friends, co-workers and relatives were at a loss to 
explain her death and how the 14-year-old fit into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
McLean's father, Joe Rasciella, who lives next door to his daughter, said the 
family had no contact with the boy other than "waving to him as we drove down 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
He said his daughter "had no enemies. None. Everybody loved her." 
</P>
<P>
McLean's colleagues described her as a compassionate friend, a devoted mother 
and an exceptionally competent secretary. McLean worked for Justice Sheila 
Prell Sonenshine at the Santa Ana offices of the state's 4th District Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon Scoville, presiding justice of the 4th District Court of Appeal, said 
her colleagues had "nothing but the highest regard for her." 
</P>
<P>
Friends described McLean as a woman of deep but private religious convictions 
and a devoted mother. They said she was very proud of her 15-year-old daughter, 
one of the youngest members of her high school tennis team, and her 18-year-old 
son, an accomplished artist. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Hayes, 39, a clerk in the appeals court, said she and McLean worked 
together as secretaries in the Westminster branch of the county public 
defender's office from 1979 to 1982. For years, the two women have shared 
frequent dinners and occasionally attended Bible-study sessions together, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said "everyone" liked McLean and felt they could come to her for help 
with their personal or professional troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very loyal friend and she'd do anything to help you," Hayes said.

NEW WELFARE OFFICE TO SERVE S. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new welfare office to serve poor and elderly residents in South County will 
open April 1 near La Paz Road and McIntyre Street. 
</P>
<P>
Financing the office became a priority in September after an attempt by county 
officials to close down the small welfare office in San Juan Capistrano caused 
a public outcry. Those opposing the closure said it would force the poor to 
make the long trip to the county welfare office in Costa Mesa. The San Juan 
Capistrano office was closed for less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
According to budget documents, the net cost to establish the new office will be 
$120,000. Ten new staff members will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
The action for the additional tax funds for the office came Tuesday during the 
County Board of Supervisors midyear review of the 1989-90 budget. 
</P>
<P>
County welfare officials said they originally decided to close the Capistrano 
facility because the three staffers were overwhelmed by the workload and the 
welfare recipients could be better served at the larger Costa Mesa office. 
</P>
<P>
"This board action provides for the reorganization of the Social Services 
Agency staff, so services can be provided at the South County facility," said 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose 5th District includes Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The new office will offer Medi-Cal services for disabled, elderly and 
low-income residents. It also will offer assistance to Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children recipients, those receiving food stamps and immediate help 
for the homeless and their families. The office will include child abuse 
response workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-square-foot facility has already been leased by the county and will 
be ready to open in about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The voluntary agencies and many of the South County cities have been strong 
advocates for a regional county facility to which they could refer residents 
needing help," Riley said. "I am excited that we will now have a permanent 
program in place." 
</P>
<P>
County figures show that more than 600 welfare recipients live in the southern 
part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter, supervisors said that in two weeks they will tackle the 
financial problem of trying to increase the number of sheriff's deputies 
patrolling unincorporated areas of South County. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he is confident a plan will be worked out to 
add deputies in South County, which has experienced an 18% population increase 
in each of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring 54 more deputies could cost $3.6 million a year, an earlier report said, 
although a less expensive option would be to hire eight unsworn officers and 20 
sworn deputies at an annual cost of $1.2 million. GEORGE FRANK

WOMAN TAKES STAND AGAINST BULLDOZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM GOMEZ and FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bright yellow bulldozer was tearing up clumps of bushes and trees in a dry 
creek bed as Laguna Canyon resident and activist Marielle Leeds just happened 
to pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Angry over the sight, Leeds did not hesitate to move into action. She stood in 
front of the earthmover and ordered her mother, Bess, to alert the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed at him (the bulldozer operator) and told him that was enough," said 
Leeds, who said she knew there were no permits to grade the 10-acre parcel at 
Laguna Canyon and El Toro roads. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what is supposed to go on around here," Leeds said. "He was scooping up 
dirt, wrecking the environment. This (site) is a real critical point here. It 
is in the middle of the (Laguna) greenbelt." 
</P>
<P>
Although Leeds feared that the bulldozer was a sign that the landowner, the 
Laguna Hills-based Rossmoor Liquidating Trust, was planning to build illegally, 
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that was not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said a company representative came to City Hall last month and asked if 
the company needed a permit to clear the land of unwanted vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that the answer was no," said Frank, who all but forgot about the 
conversation until Leeds alerted him Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the brush clearing, however, the operator had dug into the 
dirt in several places and filled in a portion of a major creek bed that moves 
rain water from the canyon to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed that they would use a weed eater or some other method to clear the 
site," Frank said. "If you bring in a bulldozer, you are grading the land." 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the scene, Frank and another city employee surveyed the site and 
issued a "stop work order." 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozer operator Leonard Schwendeman was ordered to clear the creek bed of 
soil and a city building inspector was stationed at the site to ensure 
Schwendeman complied. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Rossmoor were unavailable for comment. A secretary at the 
company's headquarters said that top officials were out of the office for the 
day. 
</P>

SOS AGREES TO BUY SITE FOR $1.4 MILLION

Share Our Selves, the embattled charity being evicted from its city-leased home 
in a residential community center, signed an agreement Tuesday to purchase a 
building in a south Costa Mesa industrial area, where many neighboring business 
owners have already raised objections to the group's presence. 
</P>
<P>
The building is at 1550 Superior Ave. in a southwest part of the city dotted 
with commercial and light industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
SOS board chairman Scott Mather said the group has agreed to pay $1.4 million 
for 5,700 square feet in a 12,000-square-foot building. The sale is contingent 
on the city's permitting the charity to operate at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some opposition, Mather called the purchase a "major milestone" for 
20-year-old SOS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big step in the right direction," he said. "We're going to take control 
of our own destiny for the people we serve." 
</P>
<P>
SOS directors have promised to mount a public relations campaign to stave off 
opposition from residents who complain about the type of people the agency 
attracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that anywhere we go there will be problems," said SOS founder and 
chairwoman Jean Forbath. "But we've learned our lesson. We need to explain who 
we are and what we are doing before they hear bad things about our people. We 
would like to work in the community before anything goes forward." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the city officials had considered leasing the Superior 
Avenue building for the charity until the City Council rejected the plan as too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
During the council meeting, owners of several businesses and an adjacent mobile 
home park objected to the charity moving to the neighborhood. Among their 
objections was the concern that crime might increase. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said at the time that, despite some objections, they 
would support the move. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said Tuesday that "there are some concerns that 
have to be addressed, but I think it is do-able. I believe the true impact on 
the area will be minimal. I think that if the business people would go and see 
the people that they (SOS) serve, many of their fears would be allayed." 
</P>
<P>
SOS is one of the largest private nonprofit groups in the county and provides 
food, clothing, medical and financial assistance to more than 20,000 needy 
people a month. CARLA RIVERA

FIRE DEPARTMENT FEE SETUP GAINS GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Board of Supervisors cleared the way Tuesday for the Orange County Fire 
Department to begin charging fees next year for paramedic and other services. 
</P>
<P>
The fee program, part of a major restructuring of the Fire Department, has been 
held up for several weeks because of concerns expressed to supervisors by 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Leisure World in Laguna Hills, in particular, were upset about the 
prospect of having to pay a yearly subscription rate for paramedic service of 
between $30 and $45 -- or face $150 to $250 charges each time paramedics were 
dispatched to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
But a compromise was worked out with the assistance of Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley, whose district includes Leisure World. Under the plan adopted Tuesday, 
the Fire Department was instructed to develop a new fee schedule that takes 
into consideration discounts for senior citizens, the ability to pay and 
communitywide subscription incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fees must be approved by the board and by the city councils of the 
Fire Department's contract cities before they are implemented next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department provides services to Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, La Palma, 
Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Placentia, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, 
Stanton, Tustin, Villa Park and Yorba Linda. BOB SCHWARTZ

SEYMOUR LEADS BERGESON IN FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE STATE SENATOR FROM ANAHEIM HAS RAISED $767,000 IN HIS BID FOR THE 
GOP NOMINATION FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, A LEAD OF MORE THAN $100,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With $767,000 in campaign contributions collected as of Tuesday, state Sen. 
John Seymour of Anaheim is outpacing his expected rival, Sen. Marian Bergeson 
of Newport Beach, by more than $100,000 in the GOP race for lieutenant 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Bergeson's total of $645,000 includes $200,000 that she 
carried over from her state Senate war chest, Seymour's fund-raising appeared 
all the more impressive. Seymour started his drive from scratch last March. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, 52, formally declared his candidacy Monday, while Bergeson, 62, is 
expected to do so this week. The winner of June's GOP primary will go on to 
face Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, a Democrat, in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour described his superior fund-raising as proof that he has stronger 
statewide support than Bergeson, adding that he raised 80% of his contributions 
from outside his Orange County senatorial district. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud of what we've been able to accomplish, but we have a long way to 
go," Seymour said Tuesday from his office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson played down the fund-raising comparisons, asserting that her political 
strength lies in a statewide network of volunteers that she is counting on to 
help get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is far more to the campaign than money," Bergeson said Tuesday 
from her office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts, however, say the campaign for lieutenant governor will be 
won or lost on television -- and that it takes money to buy TV commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the person with the healthiest budget is able to start the TV 
campaign first," said Greg Haskin, executive director of the Republican Party 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And whoever emerges victorious from the GOP primary will need even more money 
to unseat McCarthy in the general election, Haskin and other analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Seymour and Bergeson said they would have to raise between $3 million and 
$5 million to wage an effective challenge against the formidable incumbent. For 
the GOP primary, Seymour's goal is to raise $1.5 million and Bergeson's is to 
raise $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge will be in raising another three-quarters of a million dollars 
in less than half the time," Seymour noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said that she, too, is confident of reaching her fund-raising goal. 
Both she and Seymour have organized campaign committees throughout the state: 
Seymour claims representation in all 58 California counties, with the exception 
of Yuba County. While admittedly not having committees in every county, 
Bergeson said her campaign is represented in all the state's geographic 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is still just the beginning" of the race, Bergeson added. 
</P>
<P>
The real face-off between the two is expected to begin in mid-April, when 
candidates for statewide office typically begin their television campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, running a statewide race and building name identification 
across the state in an office other than governor is simply a method of buying 
the right TV time and having a great producer and director of your 
commercials," Haskin said. "And it is a matter of being lucky enough to hit on 
the right message for voters." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said her anticipated $1 million in contributions would be more than 
enough to buy her television time throughout California. She said that her 
staff has already purchased television spots in the final weeks before the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he would soon be spending most of his money on television spots. 
He conceded that both he and Bergeson do not have high name recognition in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to raise the dollars" to get that recognition, Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor and state senator since 1982, has had more 
experience than Bergeson as a political fund-raiser. As chairman of the Senate 
Republican Caucus from 1983 until 1987, he raised more than $1 million for his 
GOP colleagues. Seymour also was chairman of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson's executive 
steering committee in his 1988 reelection campaign, a job that required him to 
raise money throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, a former Newport-Mesa Unified School District trustee who was elected 
to the Assembly in 1978 and then to the state Senate in 1984, is seen by Orange 
County Republican analysts as less aggressive than Seymour though still an 
effective fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can network statewide," Bergeson said in a past interview.

AIRPORT TERMINAL NAMED AFTER RILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Despite a late protest from a Costa Mesa resident, the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday named its new $57-million terminal at John Wayne Airport in honor of 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great day again for Orange County to recognize one of our own," 
Supervisors' Chairman Don R. Roth said, adding that the tough negotiations 
leading to the expansion would not have been possible without Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Riley -- 77, the senior member on the board, who is running for reelection in 
June -- will join former supervisors Ralph B. Clark, Ronald W. Caspers and C.M. 
(Cye) Featherly who had parks or buildings named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was humbled by the fact that the other supervisors would vote to 
have the terminal named after him," one staff member said. "Not everyone 
realizes how tough the negotiations and legal battles were between the county 
and the residents of Newport Beach, whose homes are under the flight path. 
Sometimes people forget that Tom lives in Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
During a dispute over adding commercial flights, Riley's next-door neighbor 
even put up a sign reading, "Dump Riley." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the Tuesday meeting and after supervisors voted on the matter, 
Linda Fiffer, a Costa Mesa resident, told the board that she objected to the 
terminal being named after Riley. She had a petition with 647 signatures 
supporting a move to drop all names from the airport, including that of John 
Wayne. She said the airport should simply be called Orange County Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The building that will bear Riley's name is a 338,000-square-foot, two-story 
structure built in the likeness of an airplane fuselage. The terminal is part 
of an overall $310-million expansion project, the largest county public works 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said Riley, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general, has spent "time in 
the trenches" to get the project completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of a no more fitting tribute to the man who is largely 
responsible" for the airport expansion, he said.

CAPIZZI TOPS $100,000 IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Political backers for newly appointed Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced 
Tuesday that he has raised more than $100,000 in his campaign to retain his 
post in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
But news of the district attorney's campaign fund brought a sharp rebuke from 
one of his opponents, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, who said he hopes to 
rely on volunteers instead of large money contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"Because when you take a lot of money from individuals, you have got to expect 
that they are going to ask for a favor somewhere along the line," Avdeef said. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's campaign finance report, filed Tuesday, listed $68,760 in 
contributions by Dec. 31, 1989. But a $1,000-a-couple Capizzi dinner at the 
Irvine Hilton on Tuesday night, with former state Supreme Court Justice John 
Arguelles scheduled as the main guest, easily put Capizzi over the $100,000 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef said his own contributions by the end of 1989 amounted to about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like a volunteer on every street corner," Avdeef said. "If you've got 
people who are out there working for you with their heart, you don't have that 
expectation . . . of a pay back." 
</P>
<P>
But despite such criticism, Capizzi's political backers said they believe it 
shows Capizzi as the only candidate with broad-based support. 
</P>
<P>
"The response we have had has been great," said Capizzi campaign chairman Bill 
Wenke. In a news release, issued by Capizzi political consultant Eileen 
Padberg, Capizzi said, "It's going to be a significant week for me," primarily 
because of Arguelles' appearance on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's campaign report showed his largest contributor as the Lincoln Club, 
the Republican high-finance group, which gave him $5,000. His next largest 
donation was $2,000 from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. The bulk of his 
contributions were $1,000 or less from members of the defense bar who have 
known Capizzi for years. Only four prosecutors within the office were listed as 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef countered that while his own campaign "may not have a lot of tangibles, 
we have a lot of intangibles in this race, a lot of support from various 
segments of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef called a press conference Tuesday to stir up interest in his lawsuit 
challenging the Board of Supervisors' authority to appoint Capizzi on Jan. 2 to 
replace Cecil Hicks, who accepted a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will be heard on Friday morning by Superior Court Judge Eileen C. 
Moore. But whatever Moore decides, the issue will likely be carried to the 4th 
District Court of Appeal before it is decided. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef has been joined in the lawsuit by Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. 
Enright. Should the Avdeef lawsuit prevail, Enright would be in line to take 
over duties as acting district attorney until the election. 
</P>
<P>
However, few lawyers at the County Courthouse give Avdeef's lawsuit much chance 
of winning, since county supervisors statewide have been making similar 
appointments for years. The county counsel's office has informed the 
supervisors that Avdeef and his lawyers have incorrectly interpreted the 
applicable government code section. Avdeef himself admits that there is no 
precedent for what he is asking the court to do. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors appointed Capizzi to fill out Hicks' term, which runs to the 
end of 1990. The district attorney elected in June would take over Jan. 1, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Enright so far has not said whether he will run. The other candidate, Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, announced this week that his campaign will be run 
by well-known Santa Ana defense attorney Keith C. Monroe.

D.A. ELEVATES DEPUTY TO HEAD HIS SPECIAL OPERATIONS OFFICE

John D. Conley, who created the sexual assault and gang units for the district 
attorney's office, was named Tuesday as assistant district attorney in charge 
of special operations, a move which essentially makes him the No. 3 prosecutor 
within the office. 
</P>
<P>
Conley replaces Maurice L. Evans, who was recently named by Dist. Atty. Michael 
R. Capizzi to Capizzi's former post of chief assistant. Capizzi was appointed 
by the Board of Supervisors less than a month ago to replace longtime Dist. 
Atty. Cecil Hicks, who accepted a judgeship. On paper, the chief deputy 
district attorney, James G. Enright, is second in line of authority, should 
Capizzi be out of the county. But Enright is a political opponent of Capizzi, 
and most attorneys within the office consider Evans -- and now Conley -- the 
two most powerful prosecutors in the office under Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
The special operations office is responsible for writs and appeals, fraud, 
narcotics, special assignments, training, consumer and environmental 
protection, and the family support sections. 
</P>
<P>
Conley received the prestigious Outstanding Prosecutor award in 1988 from the 
state district attorneys association. The award was given partly because of his 
successful prosecution of Virl Earles, the driver of a boat which crashed into 
a concrete buoy in Anaheim Bay in Seal Beach, killing five people. Conley won 
the case at a second trial after nine jurors had voted to acquit Earles at the 
first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Conley also has gained recognition for setting up and managing the office's 
first sexual assault and gang units. Before, prosecution of those crimes simply 
fell within the felony and homicide panels in the office. Conley's most recent 
assignment has been the dual role of running the juvenile and gang unit 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to have many qualified applicants," Capizzi said in a news 
release about Conley's appointment. "John was picked because he is not only an 
experienced trial lawyer, but a fine manager." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Capizzi's appointment by the supervisors on Jan. 2, legal 
pundits at the courthouse predicted that it would mean promotions for Evans and 
Conley, who have both been close to Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, however, still has a hurdle left to clear. Enright and Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Thomas Avdeef have filed a lawsuit challenging the supervisors' authority 
to appoint Capizzi to the district attorney's post. They claim that the 
district attorney's duties should go to Enright -- as chief deputy -- until the 
June 5 election decides a new district attorney.JERRY HICKS

A WOEFUL JANUARY ENDS WELL FOR KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a month, King Coach Tom Webster has been trying to find a cure for what has 
been ailing his team. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Webster got sick, leaving midway through a game against the New 
Jersey Devils at the Forum after developing flu symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings got well, perhaps finding that elusive cure in a 5-2 victory 
before a crowd of 14,032. 
</P>
<P>
One victory does not end a slump, but this was the club's most impressive 
performance in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The team had a 1-8-2 mark since New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even in their only victory, the Kings had surrendered four goals to the 
Detroit Red Wings, second worst club in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The controversial trade of center Bernie Nicholls to the New York Rangers 
hadn't yet shown much in the way of positive results. One of the new right 
wingers, Tony Granato, has been hampered by a groin injury. The other, Tomas 
Sandstrom, had yet to score. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom scored two of the Kings' five goals, and the club went on to beat the 
co-leaders in the Patrick Division, allowing the fewest goals since beating the 
Vancouver Canucks, 4-1, almost five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This was exactly what we needed," said assistant Coach Cap Raeder, who helped 
run the team in Webster's absence. "I still think we can play a hell of a lot 
better, but it's a start." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings can always depend on the Devils for a lift at home. New Jersey is now 
1-23-6 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't think about the trade," Sandstrom said. "I'm just happy to be out 
there playing. Everything is new after you are traded, but I feel a lot better 
after every game." 
</P>
<P>
For the second game in a row, the Kings started slowly. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't take a shot on goal through nearly the first five minutes. It was 
worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky passed the puck to Sandstrom, who took it on the left side, 
skated across the blue line to the top of the circle and fired in a 35-foot 
shot, the puck flying past the stick of New Jersey goalie Sean Burke at 4:41 of 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Sandstrom, has 21 in 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
The assist gave Gretzky 100 points. He has been in triple figures every year 
since breaking with the old World Hockey Assn. in the 1978-79 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils tied the game 1 1/2 minutes into the second period. Bruce Driver 
took a pass from Alexei Kasatonov, skated up the left side, shot from almost 
the exact same spot Sandstrom had fired from and achieved the same result. 
</P>
<P>
Driver's shot got through, just inside the left post and just outside goalie 
Kelly Hrudey's stick. Hrudey was in position, but reacted too late. 
</P>
<P>
The goal was just Driver's sixth in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings moved back out in front, 2-1, after putting on a passing clinic. 
Defenseman Larry Robinson shoved the puck to the right side. Todd Elik centered 
it for Mikko Makela, who then passed it to Robinson, skating in from the left 
side of the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson took one shot, blocked by Burke, then got the rebound and scored on 
his second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's goal, his seventh, came at 4:15. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils moved back into a tie at 9:53, when John MacLean scored his 
team-high 30th goal, tipping in a shot from the slot by Brendan Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean had gone scoreless for two straight games after collecting goals in 
four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings went back into the lead on a goal that was all Steve Kasper. He took 
a pass from Larry Robinson and found himself alone on the breakaway just across 
the red line. 
</P>
<P>
Kasper skated to the right side of the goal mouth and backhanded the puck in at 
15:33 past a diving Burke for his 15th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings padded their lead with just 28 seconds remaining in the period. Marty 
McSorley made it 4-2 with a shot from the right circle that went by two Devil 
defenders and over Burke's glove. 
</P>
<P>
It was McSorley's 10th goal, equaling his total for last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom scored on a power play in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starved for victories," said Hrudey, who played an excellent game in 
goal, facing 34 shots and stopping 32. In the final period, he made two great 
one-handed saves. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in awhile, he smiled as he spoke to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Webster had to be smiling, too. 
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes 
</P>
<P>
This was the final game for New Jersey right wing Brendan Shanahan before the 
start of a five-game suspension. Shanahan's unscheduled vacation is the result 
of a high-sticking incident with Michel Petit of the Quebec Nordiques in 
mid-January . . . Larry Robinson's two points Thursday gave him 915 for his 
career, tying him for second with Bobby Orr on the all-time list for defensemen 
behind Denis Potvin.

MIKE DOWNEY: DAVIS SHOULD GET HIS DUE: HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Davis did not announce where -- if anywhere -- his football team would be 
moving before last Saturday's vote for the NFL's Hall of Fame. Maybe he 
deliberately waited. Or maybe he couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how much making the Hall of Fame means to Davis, or why he hasn't 
already made it, or how much his herding of the Raiders from Northern to 
Southern California has do to with it. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, I haven't lost one minute of sleep feeling sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, though, let me make a couple of things perfectly clear: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One, no matter what you think of the man, Al Davis definitely belongs in 
the Hall of Fame. His not being inducted is a travesty. He has played an 
important part in the rise of pro football to the status of National Pastime 
1-A. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two, no matter when or where Davis moves the Raiders, it is his business. 
Why? Because it is his business. He runs it. You wouldn't want somebody telling 
you where you had to run your business. It's Al's team; not yours, not mine, 
not Oakland's, not L.A.'s. His. 
</P>
<P>
So, when we get the news -- no matter what it is -- I side with Davis. If he 
wants to take his team back to the Bay Area, fine. Oakland never deserved being 
deserted. If Davis wants to take it to Sacramento, double fine. The state 
capital should have a team. It's a big-league sports town. 
</P>
<P>
Where would I prefer the Raiders to play? 
</P>
<P>
Right where they are. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Oakland's fans whoop and holler for the Raiders in an exhibition 
game there, I made a remark to the extent of: "If they want the Raiders that 
badly, let them have them." Some of the Raider management people took that 
personally. They take a lot of things personally. They see enemies under their 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, the thought of Los Angeles proper not having its own NFL team is not 
a pleasant one. If the Coliseum can be streamlined and converted into an 
intimate setting, then I say: On with the show. I'll start singing, "Stay" in 
Frankie Valli's falsetto, if that's what it takes. Won't you stay, Al? 
Pleeeeeeeez stay. 
</P>
<P>
If he does go, though, more power to him. Los Angeles would get in line with 
St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities seduced and abandoned. Yet, I don't know 
a soul in L.A. who feels sorry for Minneapolis for losing the Lakers, or for 
Brooklyn over the Dodger kidnapping, or Cleveland over the hijacking of the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
So, if the Raiders go, shut up already. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't sit around the way they do in St. Louis and Baltimore and play 
make-believe that the next NFL expansion team is definitely coming your way. 
Don't kid yourselves. It took Minnesota something like a quarter-century to get 
pro basketball back. Some franchises never get recycled. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders announce that they are leaving, and spend another season here as 
lame ducks, then I suggest not squandering good money on tickets. Otherwise, be 
a good loser and wish the next town luck. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to a voter after the Hall of Fame ballots were cast, a guy who said he 
voted for Davis and always does. He told me the anti-Al coalition harps on his 
"negative contributions" to the game, insisting that these more than balance 
out his virtues. Hauling the NFL into court, costing it in the neighborhood of 
$150 million, pioneering a stampede of carpetbaggers -- such behavior continues 
to be used in argument against Davis' election. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you don't have to like Al Davis to think him worthy of the Hall of Fame. 
You can't fault a football man just because he played some hardball. Davis 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
As owners go, George Halas, Paul Brown, Art Rooney and others were more worthy. 
I knew George Halas personally, and let me tell you, this guy is no George 
Halas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he is no Gaylord Perry either. Al Davis played to win but he didn't cheat 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
He may not have been in a league with Halas, but he has been a pretty big 
contributor to Halas' league. 
</P>
<P>
Davis acts as presenter for many of his former Raider players on Hall of Fame 
induction day. Seven, so far. He may be there again soon, when Ted Hendricks 
takes the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, somebody will present him. A man with 30 years in pro ball. Former 
commissioner of the American Football League. Youngest man, at 33, to hold the 
dual positions of coach and general manager. Boss of three Super Bowl 
champions. Employer of the NFL's first black coach in the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mind if Al Davis goes to Oakland or Sacramento. I do mind that he 
hasn't yet gone -- except on someone else's behalf -- to Canton, Ohio.

DRAG RACING: SHIRLEY MULDOWNEY HAD A CAR BUT NO SPONSOR. LARRY MINOR HAD A 
SPONSOR BUT NO TIME. SO, THE TWO HAVE COMBINED THE POSITIVES GOING INTO THE 
WINTERNATIONALS. 
</P>

SAN JACINTO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley Muldowney had a new dragster on order from Al Swindahl, but no sponsor 
to pay the bills as the 1990 National Hot Rod Assn. season approached. It 
appeared that her season might end with the Winternationals, the opening event 
this weekend at Pomona Fairplex. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Minor had a new dragster on order from Al Swindahl and a sponsor on hold, 
but his hopes of coming out of retirement to drive a top fuel dragster were 
frustrated by the pressure of running his multimillion-dollar farming and 
ranching business. 
</P>
<P>
The solution: Minor bought Muldowney's dragster, put the name of his new 
sponsor on its sides and hired the three-time world champion to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd known Shirley since I started racing in 1978, but only as a competitor," 
Minor said. "We were never close friends or anything like that. I'd always 
admired the way she drove, but that was about it." 
</P>
<P>
The first move toward a union occurred last summer during the U. S. Nationals 
at Indianapolis, where Muldowney failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Rahn Tobler, her husband and crew chief, confided to Minor that Muldowney's 
sponsorship deal with Performance Automotive Wholesale was ending after four 
seasons, and said if he ever needed a driver, she was available. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, running another car was the farthest thought from my mind," 
Minor said. He already had one top fuel driver, Dick LaHaie, the 1987 Winston 
champion, and a funny car driver, Ed (Ace) McCulloch. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the 1989 season, however, Minor got the urge to return to 
racing after a year's absence, so he ordered a new dragster. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I might be able to make the Winston Final (last race of the NHRA 
season) last year and maybe the first couple this year," Minor said. "You've 
got to order a car nearly a year ahead if you expect to have it ready for 
Pomona. I started getting a crew together, but shortly before the (Final) I 
realized I couldn't take the time off, so I hired Frank Hawley to drive it in 
that one race. 
</P>
<P>
"That left me with a second car for 1990 and no one to drive it. I had just 
about worked out a sponsorship deal with Paul Pope (owner of Otter-Pops, an 
Arcadia-based fast-freeze product) when Rahn and Shirley called from Palm 
Springs and said they'd like to stop by on their way home. It was early in 
December, and we talked for several hours. The longer we talked, the better it 
seemed for me to have Shirley drive my car." 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney had made a comeback after the U. S. Nationals. She won the 
Fallnationals in Chandler, Ariz., for her first national victory since a 1984 
racing accident that shattered both legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I called Paul to find his reaction to sponsoring Shirley, and he said, 'Great 
idea,' so that's how it all came together." 
</P>
<P>
Minor, 49, had raced his own top fuel dragster from 1983 through the first race 
of 1988, the Winternationals. He was fast qualifier at Pomona in his last 
outing, recording a career-best of 5.180 seconds elapsed time for the 
quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
He won two NHRA national events, the 1983 Cajon Nationals and the 1986 
Mile-High Nationals. He also was the first driver to break the 5.25-second 
barrier with a 5.247 run at the 1987 Gatornationals in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed racing, but when my dad got sick in December 1987, the 
business required more and more time from my brother, Wayne, and myself. When 
Dad was active, I could take off and go racing, but not any more. The business 
is just too demanding." 
</P>
<P>
Minor's Agri-Empire, Inc. is located in San Jacinto, a community of 15,000 and 
the oldest incorporated city in Riverside County. But the empire is far-flung. 
</P>
<P>
He oversees 15,000 acres planted in potatoes within 75 miles of the downtown 
packing shed where 10,000 hundred-weight sacks are processed every day. 
Agri-Empire is the largest grower, shipper and broker of potatoes in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my best customers is Alex Foods, which shows that racers stick 
together. They take 100,000 pounds of potatoes every day, five days a week, 52 
weeks a year, for their salads. Every day, they bring all the leftovers back 
here, where we mix it with potato culls for feed." 
</P>
<P>
The Morales family, which sponsored Alex Foods racing cars, has been a fixture 
in sprint car and Indy car racing for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Their leftovers help feed Minor's 40,000 head of cattle. He owns 65,000 acres 
in Utah, 35,000 in Oregon and 25,000 in Montana, where the cattle are fattened 
for market. He also keeps about 2,200 head in Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be mostly into potatoes, but I'd say we're pretty evenly divided 
these days between potatoes, cattle and land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in these parts since my grandfather came to Moreno Valley from 
Texas, when my dad was 12. When my dad was old enough, he started growing sweet 
potatoes and then he switched to potatoes, just reds and whites. I remember 
when I was a little boy, my dad was out farming all day. We had no employees, 
no equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd make a little money and turn it right over into more acreage. That's how 
he built up the business, scraping every penny he could for more land. He 
worked hard every day of his life." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Minor died last April. 
</P>
<P>
Off-road racing seemed to be a way of life for teen-agers growing up in the 
Hemet-San Jacinto area, so it was no surprise when Larry Minor joined Rod Hall, 
Walker Evans, Jim Fricker and Jim Venable in desert racing. Minor was named 
driver of the year by Four Wheeler Magazine in 1968 after he won his class 
driving a Ford Bronco for Bill Stroppe and actor James Garner in the Mint 400, 
the Stardust/7 Eleven race and the Baja 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great place for growing up. There's so much room to roam," he said. 
"I gave up off-road racing to go into drags in 1984, but my boys are into it 
now. Chris, who is 24, and Larry Gene, who is 22, are both racing trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Minor won the pickup class and finished fifth overall in last Saturday's 
SCORE Parker 400, driving a Chevy truck with Dick Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Minor switched his interest from off-roading to dragsters after watching 
the World Finals at Ontario in 1977 with Jack Bayer, who built the engines for 
his off-road trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw the top fuelers, I wanted in," Minor said. "I bought a 
dragster from Sherm Gunn, but I couldn't get a license in time for the first 
race. I was so gung-ho to get started that I got Larry Bowers to drive it for 
me. The first run was at night, down at Orange County Raceway, and all my 
family was there ready to find out all about drag racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry made a pass, smoked the tires, hit the guard rail, got upside down, 
broke both his arms and destroyed the car. I thought, 'What did I get myself 
into?' and my family totally opposed my driving after seeing the crash." 
</P>
<P>
Minor bought another car from Gunn, put Larry Dixon in it and campaigned for 
two years before he decided he was ready for a top driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said, 'Why don't you talk to Gary Beck?' and he wound up driving for 
me for six years, and for a couple of years there we were just about 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
"Beck moved out to Hemet, and he and (crew chief) Bernie Fedderly built the 
strongest engines in drag racing." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when Minor decided to campaign a second dragster himself, the blue 
Larry Minor Motorsports dragsters dominated their class. When the season ended, 
Beck had won his third U. S. Nationals, set the national record of 5.39 seconds 
at the Golden State Nationals and had posted the 17 fastest times ever 
recorded. Minor had the 18th fastest and Beck had Nos. 19 through 21. 
</P>
<P>
The pair qualified at every race in which they appeared, and met in the final 
round of the Cajun Nationals, where Minor "upset" his No. 1 driver in a curious 
race that saw Minor do everything he could to lose, so that Beck would get more 
points toward winning the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Beck blew the blower belt coming off the starting line, and Minor, when he 
realized something was wrong, hit the brakes to let Beck coast across the 
winner. But he had too much momentum and finished first in the painfully slow 
time of 8.78 seconds to 8.95 for Beck. 
</P>
<P>
"The saddest look I've ever seen on a winner was when Larry won at the Cajuns," 
Beck said. "After we launched, he looked around and couldn't see me, so he 
slowed down. In the victory circle, he looked more like the loser because we'd 
been pointing our major effort toward my car, and he had just beat me out of 
200 points. But it really wouldn't have made any difference, because even if 
I'd been racing someone else, I would have lost them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The win came in only the fourth race of Minor's drag racing career. 
</P>
<P>
"Beck taught me the professional side of drag racing," Minor said. "He and 
Bernie (Fedderly) were years ahead with their engine development." 
</P>
<P>
Fedderly is still with Minor, now doing the engine work for McCulloch's 
Oldsmobile funny car. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always asking me why I have a funny car when I've been a top fuel 
man from the start," Minor said. "Well, I was walking through the pits one 
night at Orange County in 1984 when a couple of guys introduced themselves to 
me. They said they were from Oldsmobile, liked my operation and asked if I 
would be interested in running a funny car. When they told me the (financial) 
numbers, I said 'sure.' 
</P>
<P>
"I got Ace (McCulloch) to come out of retirement, and we've all been together 
ever since." 
</P>
<P>
McCulloch, in his 21st year of funny car racing, clocked the fastest time ever 
in the division, 5.13 seconds, last year at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
When Minor and Beck split toward the end of the 1986 season, Minor needed a new 
driver to fulfill his sponsorship contract with Miller High Life, so he tabbed 
LaHaie, an independent from Lansing, Mich., who had his daughter, Kim, as his 
crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
"LaHaie wasn't real well known then, but I'd liked the way he worked, so I 
hired him," said Minor. "It didn't take him long to prove me right." LaHaie won 
the top fuel championship in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I don't like about having LaHaie is that he keeps his operation 
in Michigan," said Minor. "I like a hands-on operation, which is the way I run 
all my businesses. That's why I have Shirley's car in my shop out here. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, a lot of people have thanked me for keeping Shirley in the game, but 
the truth is I didn't just do it for her. I did it as much for myself as I did 
it for Shirley." 
</P>
<P>
When Muldowney brings her new dragster to the starting line this weekend, her 
fans will be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in her career, she will not be in a pink car. It will be 
dark blue, as are all of Minor's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll still be a little pink," she said from her home in Northridge. "I'll 
wear a pink helmet, and my driving suit will still be pink. I don't care what 
color the car is if it wins." 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney gave the car its first trial run last weekend at Famoso, near 
Bakersfield, but engine problems prevented her from making a full pass. 
</P>
<P>
"The motor sounded great, and we found our problem and expect to have it cured 
by the time we get to the track Thursday (first day of qualifying for Sunday's 
Winternationals). The car is quite a bit different from last year's model, but 
all the changes should be for the better." 
</P>
<P>
The Swindahl-built creation has been stretched eight inches to the maximum 300. 
The motor has been set back eight inches and the driver's seat has been moved 
back 16 inches -- all changes designed to get more horsepower to the huge rear 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of car," Muldowney said. "It should get a lot more traction to the 
race track. I'm excited about the new year. I like the idea of driving for 
Larry Minor, and, if we win some races, it will be the best program I've ever 
had."

ANGELS, HARVEY REACH AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relief pitcher Bryan Harvey, whose 25 saves last season matched the 
second-highest total ever achieved by an Angel pitcher, agreed to a one-year 
contract with the Angels for $332,500 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been two seasons. I think I'm doing pretty well," said Harvey, who 
was 3-3 with a 3.44 earned-run average and 78 strikeouts in 55 innings last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've been pretty fair, and I'm very happy," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey and Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds each averaged 12.8 strikeouts per 
nine innings last season for a major league record. His 25 saves in 32 
opportunities equaled Dave Laroche's second-place mark, set in 1978; Donnie 
Moore set the Angels' single-season record with 31 saves in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In his career, Harvey is 10-8 with a 2.58 ERA, 42 saves and 158 strikeouts in 
136 innings. 
</P>
<P>
With the threat of a spring-training lockout, Harvey may have to wait awhile 
before throwing the first pitch under his new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting around til Feb. 9 (when owners meet and could decide to 
postpone the opening of camps) to see what happens," said Harvey, who left his 
off-season home in Chattanooga, Tenn., to work out with his fellow pitchers at 
Anaheim Stadium. "I'm just getting ready to play. All I can do is be ready."

The 1990 salaries of four Angel pitchers and four other players are due to be 
determined in arbitration hearings that will begin Friday. Pitchers Chuck 
Finley, Scott Bailes, Kirk McCaskill and Bob McClure; first baseman Wally 
Joyner, third baseman Jack Howell, center fielder Devon White and catcher Bill 
Schroeder filed for arbitration and have not agreed to new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
General Managers Fred Claire of the Dodgers and Mike Port of the Angels will be 
among the speakers today at an 11 a.m. press conference at the Gene Autry 
Museum to announce the expansion of the Reviving Baseball in Inner City (RBI) 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, to be funded this year by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los 
Angeles, began in 1987 with the aim of exposing disadvantaged inner-city youths 
to baseball and helping them refine their skills.

FISH REPORT: BIG BASS ARE AVAILABLE AT LAKE CASTAIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's Lake Castaic continues to be the hot spot for largemouth 
bass, except when high winds close the launch ramp, keeping boats off the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Both the upper and lower reservoirs have been productive. Kevin Morris of Sun 
Valley took a 13-pound 4-ounce bass in the lower lake, and Bob Jones of Canoga 
Park caught an 11-pounder in the upper.

FISH CONSERVATIONISTS WELCOME RULING ON WALKER RIVER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fish conservationists are celebrating a decision by a Mono County jury that 
found Nevada farmers guilty of illegally killing thousands of trout in the East 
Walker River when they drew excessive water from Bridgeport Reservoir in the 
fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of three men and nine women deliberated for an hour last week before 
deciding that the Walker River Irrigation District had violated all three 
sections of the California Fish and Game Code cited by District Attorney Stan 
Eller. 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated," said Rick Rockel, CalTrout stream keeper for what was one of 
the state's best trophy trout waters. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Edmondson, regional director for CalTrout, said: "This means they broke the 
law and they're going to have to fix it or they'll have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The WRID owned rights to the water but, the jury found, it: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failed to notify the Department of Fish and Game of the substantial change 
in flow. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Released so much silt into the stream bed that the first mile below the dam 
was ruined for years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failed to account for the immediate welfare of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
The violations are misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $2,000, community 
service time or jail up to six months. A sentencing hearing is scheduled Feb. 
13 in Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see somebody locked up as an example for wanton destruction of our 
natural resources," Edmondson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Eller said that is sometimes difficult "when you're suing an entity." 
</P>
<P>
DFG biologist Darrell Wong said: "I'm more interested in fixing the river and 
getting a long-term solution . . . (such as establishing) a minimum maintenance 
flow and a sediment management plan." 
</P>
<P>
In the three-day trial, Wong testified that the fish population was reduced 
from 3,500 to 5,000 per mile the year before, to about 200 per mile in some 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rockel said, the stream bed insect population and trout spawning 
beds were buried by sediment, which remains. Wong noted that when a similar 
problem occurred in 1977, subsequent wet winters washed out the silt, but now 
the Eastern Sierra is in its fourth dry year. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably will be three to five years before it's back to what it was," 
Rockel said. 
</P>
<P>
A feature of the Southern California Boat Show opening Friday at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center is the new Hobie Power Skiff package. The 13- and 
15-footers, designed by longtime Hobie engineer and surfing pioneer Phil 
Edwards, come standard with EZ Loader trailers and Yamaha outboards of 40 or 50 
horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
The 15s offer Center Cockpit ($12,995), Fisherman ($12,495) and Utility 
($10,995) configurations. The 13s cost $8,995. Prices include motor and 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 powerboats and sailboats will be on display, along with 350 booths 
with equipment and services. Hours for the 10-day show are 2-10 p.m. weekdays, 
11 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $6 for 
adults, $3 for children 6-12 and free for children under 6. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego long-range: The big yellowfin tuna of the Revillagigedo Islands are 
cooperating to such an extent for those presently aboard the Royal Polaris that 
all fish weighing less than 150 pounds are being released. 
</P>
<P>
Butch Greene of Los Angeles leads the jackpot race with his 280-pound tuna. The 
boat is scheduled to return on Sunday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 18 passengers aboard the Polaris Supreme returned Monday from a 
16-day trip with 333 yellowfin, 115 wahoo and 132 grouper. Top fish: a 
271-pound yellowfin caught by Billy Shimizu. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest tuna taken aboard the Qualifier 105, which also returned Monday 
after 16 days, was a 196-pound, 7-ounce yellowfin caught by Bill Blosser of 
Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The American Angler, out for nine days, returned Saturday from the Alijos Rocks 
with 372 yellowfin -- 25 weighing more than 100 pounds -- and a few yellowtail 
and dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Cabo San Lucas: Mostly striped marlin and dorado are being caught. Hotel boats 
are reporting one to three stripers a day. Dorado are coming in between eight 
and 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Roosterfish, sierra mackerel and an occasional thresher shark to 150 pounds are 
also included in the catches. The water temperature is averaging slightly over 
70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Blake Jones Trout Derby at the Eastern Sierra's Pleasant Valley Reservoir 
and Owens River will be held March 3. Entry fee: $3 for adults, $2 for 
children. Information: (619) 873-8405. . . . Raahauge's Shotgun Sports at Norco 
will play host to the U.S. Sporting Clays Association's first FITASC tournament 
of the year Saturday and Sunday. FITASC is an acronym for the French name of 
the sport's international governing body. Competition is held in 44 countries 
on five continents.

SOUTHLAND DEER TRAPPED IN NET OF PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mule deer is minding his own business in the back-country of northern Orange 
County when a helicopter swoops low and chases him into a net. 
</P>
<P>
The deer squirms and bleats a pathetic cry as handlers wrap leather hobbles 
around his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be afraid to pull it tight," says Bob Tiegle, a big-game capture 
specialist for the California Department of Fish and Game. "It's not going to 
hurt 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Easy for him to say. 
</P>
<P>
Once bound, the deer is blindfolded to calm him, injected with vitamins and has 
blood drawn. His temperature is taken and a radio transmitter collar is 
attached so the people performing these indignities will know where to find him 
the next time. 
</P>
<P>
"Deer are typically high-strung," says Jon Fischer, a DFG wildlife biologist. 
"They'll make noise, acting like they're hurt, but they're not. I'm sure 
they're scared -- a lot." 
</P>
<P>
If the deer only knew. They will never understand it's all an act of kindness 
designed to protect them from graver, future threats in a battle they cannot 
win and can only hope to survive. 
</P>
<P>
If mountain lions don't get them . . . 
</P>
<P>
If grazing cattle don't eat their browse or trample their cover . . . 
</P>
<P>
If they don't perish from disease . . . 
</P>
<P>
If they don't starve to death . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . They may survive the eight-lane freeways that by the year 2000 will 
crisscross their range. 
</P>
<P>
At least until houses are built. 
</P>
<P>
A planned 23-mile toll road along the Eastern Transportation Corridor of 
northern Orange County was the reason for this project to capture 30 deer 
during the last few days. The state's first toll road in this century will cost 
$840 million and bisect the Santa Ana Mountains to connect the California 91 
and Interstate 5 freeways and open the area to development, including the 
construction of 12,300 homes on Irvine Company land. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Corridor Agencies commissioned P&amp;D Technologies of 
Orange to determine for their state environmental impact report whether the 
deer can live with the road. The study will cost $135,000, including $35,000 
for the helicopter, radio collars and other aspects of the capture operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see deer in Orange County from now on," said Greg 
Gerstenberg, an Orange County-based DFG wildlife biologist who coordinated the 
capture. "We would like to protect these deer." 
</P>
<P>
Hunting is not a threat. The 200 to 300 deer in the immediate study area of 16 
square miles of Irvine Company property are on private land. Bulldozers, not 
guns, are their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Weir Canyon, which is a large oak woodland -- really nice deer habitat -- is 
going to be isolated from the (Cleveland) National Forest," Gerstenberg said. 
"Freeways are basically a complete barrier to animal movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We proposed that they start this deer study to find out where deer cross, why 
they cross and what the preferences of habitat are, so when they do build the 
freeway they can provide mitigation, be it underpasses or whatever can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, if we find out there is some limiting factor, (such as) water or mineral 
licks, we can make sure that's on both sides of the freeway, so they won't want 
to go across." 
</P>
<P>
The deer have been fitted with numbered ear tags and radio collars, each with 
its distinctive beep and a range of about two miles. Their movements will be 
monitored for the next two years, by which time the batteries will die or the 
collars rot away. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Benner, supervising environmental planner for P&amp;D Technologies, 
said the company has had zoologists doing preliminary tracking by "looking for 
deer and signs of deer, such as pellets, tracks . . . (and) identifying areas 
that are good deer habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a feel where the animals are moving to and from. As they move west, 
they go across these canyons that the (Eastern Transportation Corridor) also is 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said: "If we can identify a movement corridor -- a fairly broad area 
that the deer tend to use -- maybe we can get a freeway built that allows for 
movement across that." 
</P>
<P>
There is a proposal to build a bridge for deer across Blind Canyon into the 
proposed Weir Canyon Regional Park, where no immediate housing or commercial 
development is planned. But it will take four or five years to build the 
freeway, and Fischer said, "If they work in an area that has deer, the deer are 
going to move. 
</P>
<P>
"And if this facilitates housing projects on both sides of the freeway . . . if 
it's going to be wall-to-wall housing, the whole study becomes moot because the 
deer aren't going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
But where would the deer go? Generally, a resident, non-migratory herd is slow 
to abandon its habitat, even when pushed. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sitton, DFG wildlife management supervisor for Region 5, said: "We've got 
public land up there in the Cleveland National Forest, but if we lose national 
forest land, we're really going to be hurting. That's where the Cajalco 
development -- the freeway coming over the top -- would be the bad impact. 
That's all these animals have anymore. Development has taken most of the 
private land away from them." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Cajalco project would connect Interstate 15 to Interstate 5 west 
of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Tiegle said it's possible to transplant deer to other ranges. "We have 
relocated animals," he said. "We could put 'em in a trailer and haul 'em off to 
another site." 
</P>
<P>
But that might be a last, desperate resort, when the deer are dodging commuters 
on the freeway or nibbling at the back yard begonias of housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried that before, and the deer generally end up dead within just a few 
weeks," Sitton said. "They don't adjust very well to new habitat or 
environments." 
</P>
<P>
Also, they crowd the limited habitat of the resident deer -- like moving in 
with the in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG also has done some studies over the last six months, including analysis 
of the remains of deer killed by mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals that we're seeing in Orange County are right now on the ragged 
edge of starvation," Sitton said. "They don't look too bad right now. They have 
some weight on them. But the fat content in the bone marrow is down to around 
50% when it should be up around 60% or 70%. 
</P>
<P>
"That means they're not getting proper nutrition and are metabolizing that 
marrow fat. Once they get down to a level slightly lower than right now, you 
start seeing them become more susceptible to disease and injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Then, are these deer doomed? 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is some good weather," Sitton said -- meaning rain. "We're into 
the fourth year of a drought and five inches behind our normal (rainfall) right 
now, and it doesn't look real good." 
</P>
<P>
Rain would be a short-term solution, not a guarantee of the herd's survival. 
Already they compete year-round with cattle for their food. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Burkett, also a DFG wildlife biologist, said the Irvine land has "a lot 
of cattle grazing. A lot of people will pull their cattle off in the wintertime 
and let the green germinate, then put 'em back on in the spring. But even now 
they have their cattle out there." 
</P>
<P>
There is some risk in a deer-capture project, to humans as well as animals. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've got antlers, you've got to be careful," Fischer said. "Accidents 
happen. It would be very easy for a doe to break her leg. But we're learning 
things that enable us to safely capture the animals, (so that) the losses are 
offset by the information we gain." 
</P>
<P>
The nets, hung from free-standing poles, are eight feet high and 100 feet long, 
with a five- or six-inch mesh. They're designed to collapse when deer run into 
them, giving the team time to come out from behind bushes and pounce. 
</P>
<P>
Tiegle said: "Does are easy. Bucks are a lot craftier (and) smarter." 
</P>
<P>
The study was hoping to collar 10 bucks and 20 does but at last count was three 
bucks short. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Wild, a senior veterinary student at Colorado State University, 
supervised the medical procedures at one of the two capture sites. She crashed 
through heavy brush to tackle one large doe herself and seemed unaware that her 
face was scratched and bleeding as she worked over the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure takes 10 to 15 minutes. On one deer, Fischer was concerned that 
its body temperature -- normally 101 degrees -- was getting close to the safety 
limit of 107 from stress. Sometimes they will pour water on a deer to keep it 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 105," said Scott Yoo, a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have the water up here?" Fischer asked. "We'd better get rid of this 
sucker." 
</P>
<P>
But all of the deer appeared to be unharmed as they bounded away. 
</P>
<P>
Those weighed were from 60 to 115 pounds -- smallish for deer generally, but 
Fischer said: "These animals are in good condition. There aren't a lot of 
parasites. And we're getting the first weight information we've had for Orange 
County deer." 
</P>
<P>
The herd also seems to have a good ratio of one buck to every five does. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good ratios," Sitton said, "but the trouble is that we're losing the 
habitat. The way Orange County is growing, they'll be lucky to have any deer in 
the future."

COURT RULES RUTH NAME IS PRIVATE, IMAGE IS NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Book publishers and baseball memorabilia collectors have scored a major victory 
in a court case about who can publish photographs of Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
New York federal appeals court ruled Monday that, although the Babe's heirs own 
his name, they do not own his image. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed against Macmillan Inc. by Ruth's 
daughters, Dorothy Ruth Pirone and Julia Ruth Stevens, claiming that Macmillan 
had illegally used three photographs of Ruth in a 1988 baseball trivia 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Irving R. Kaufman wrote in his opinion: "Ruth was one of the most 
photographed men of his generation, a larger-than-life hero to millions and a 
historical figure in whom interest still runs high." 
</P>
<P>
While Ruth lived, the judge wrote, he was paid by various manufacturers for the 
use of his picture or name in promoting the sale of various products. After 
Ruth's death in 1948, his daughters registered the words Babe Ruth as a 
trademark for "paper articles, namely playing cards, writing paper and 
envelopes," Kaufman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That trademark has been lucrative. Mark Roesler, president of Curtis Management 
Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing agent, said last December that 
fees paid to the Ruth family were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and were 
expected to grow to $1 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs at issue in the case appeared in the 1988 Macmillan Baseball 
Engagement Calendar. The words Babe Ruth are not on the calendar cover, the 
judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar cover has a photo of Ruth helping a small boy with his batting 
grip. Inside the calendar, there is a photo of the Babe saluting Gen. John 
Pershing and a photo of a baseball autographed by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's daughters objected to the use of Ruth's likeness. Their suit alleged 
federal and common-law trademark infringement and unfair competition, 
infringement of the common law right of publicity and violation of the New York 
Civil Rights Law. The New York law forbids the use for advertising or trade 
purposes of any portrait or picture without the consent of the subject if the 
subject is living. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kaufman acknowledged that there is a valuable commodity in a public 
figure's image, but he said that Ruth's daughters had made much too broad a 
claim.

Mark Tillmon scored 25 points, including 16 in the decisive first half Tuesday 
night, as No. 6 Georgetown gained a share of first place in the Big East 
Conference with a 70-48 victory over Seton Hall at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas (16-2, 6-2) never trailed in bouncing back from Saturday's 19-point 
loss to Syracuse and tying Connecticut for the conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, which had lost two of its past three games, built a 36-18 halftime 
lead and never let the margin slip below 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
After Seton Hall (10-8, 3-5) closed to within 43-27, Tillmon scored five points 
in a 10-0 run that gave Georgetown a secure 53-27 advantage with 9:25 left. 
</P>

No. 13 Connecticut 94, Massachusetts 75 -- Chris Smith scored 22 points and 
Tate George added 16 to lead the Huskies in a nonconference game at Amherst, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut (18-3) led 37-33 at halftime, then pulled away as Smith scored 14 
points. The Huskies were ahead by as many as 17 points in the second half and 
Massachusetts (10-8) never got closer than eight.

Leslie Rathbun's second-half performance led Woodbridge High School to a 50-44 
Pacific Coast League girls' basketball victory over Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Rathbun scored 11 of her 23 points in the third quarter to help Woodbridge 
rally from a 22-15 halftime deficit to a 36-30 lead going into the final eight 
minutes of play at Orange High School. 
</P>
<P>
Rathbun, a senior guard who was the Pacific Coast League most valuable player 
last season, made seven of 15 field goals, including one three-pointer, and 
eight of nine free throws. She also had seven assists and 11 of Woodbridge's 23 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie said she wasn't getting her shots (one of five) in the first half and I 
told her the shots were there, but she wasn't looking for the right one," 
Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. "Her control in the second half made the 
difference."

Orange Coach Ed Prange called Rathbun "one of the best (female) players in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge (18-4 overall, 7-0 in league), the county's 10th-ranked team, 
remains undefeated and Orange (13-6, 5-2) holds onto second place. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange, Nicole Champion, made eight of 15 field goals and four of six free 
throws for 20 points and had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense battled all the way and our girls never gave up," Prange said. 
"Woodbridge is just a good team. They made their free throws (including eight 
of 11 in the fourth quarter that ensured the victory) and they maintained their 
poise." BOB BORSUM

MISSION VIEJO'S SLYMEN PLANS TO ATTEND OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Slymen, a defensive tackle at Mission Viejo High School, said Tuesday he 
has made an oral commitment to attend Oregon next fall, but will probably 
redshirt his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
Slymen also considered offers from Cal and Long Beach State, but chose Oregon 
after visiting there last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the players up there redshirt their first season," Slymen said. "It 
should be a good chance for me to get to know the program better and get 
settled academically."

For a little more than a quarter, Newport Christian High School matched baskets 
with St. Margaret's, the third-ranked team in the Southern Section Small 
Schools' poll. 
</P>
<P>
But reality hit with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, St. Margaret's defeated Newport Christian, 71-33, Tuesday 
in an Academy League game at the 15th Street Gym in Newport Beach. It was the 
11th consecutive victory for St. Margaret's (14-4, 7-0 in league). 
</P>
<P>
Newport Christian (5-9, 2-5) kept pace until one minute into the second 
quarter. Led by center Ryan Westendorf, St. Margaret's went on a 24-7 run to 
close the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Westendorf, a 6-foot-7 junior, scored 21 of his game-high 25 points in the 
first half. He made 10 of 14 shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Westendorf was 12 of 23 for the game and also had 21 rebounds. CHRIS FOSTER

Cal State Fullerton and pitcher Huck Flener opened the baseball season 
impressively, leading the Titans to a 6-1 victory over Cal Poly Pomona in a 
nonconference game Tuesday at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, a junior left-hander, allowed two hits and an unearned run in six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Fitzgerald, Rich Faulks and Doug Ketchen each pitched an inning of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, who had four strikeouts, retired the final five batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Flener gave credit for his strong outing to his improved changeup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot better than last year," he said. "(Last year) I threw it, but I 
didn't have as much control. Now I can throw it when I'm behind in the count." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored four runs in the second inning. David Ayala and Mate Borgogno 
each had two-run singles. Borgogno added an RBI single in the fourth, giving 
Fullerton a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' final run came on Domingo Mota's home run over the left-field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finished with 10 hits, including two each by Borgogno and Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very well for the first time out," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell 
said. STEVE KRESAL

TILLMAN GIVES COMEBACK A LIFT WITH KNOCKOUT

Henry Tillman, the 1984 Olympic heavyweight champion whose pro career plummeted 
nearly as quickly as his amateur career had ascended, knocked out former 
Mexican heavyweight champion Gerardo Valero of Tijuana just 1 minute 7 seconds 
into the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout Tuesday night at the Country 
Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, who won the North American Boxing Federation championship in 1986 in 
just his 10th pro fight, lost to Bert Cooper later that year and then was 
crushed by former Olympic team roommate Evander Holyfield in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He later lost to Canadian Doug de Wit -- the man he defeated in the Olympic 
final -- and also lost to little-known Duane Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed out of the ring for a year and a half before launching a comeback 
last December in Florida.

BECKMAN POSTS LOWER PROFITS AND FLAT SALES

<P>
Beckman Instruments on Tuesday reported flat sales and slightly lower profits 
for its fourth quarter and year. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended Dec. 31, the Fullerton-based manufacturer of scientific and 
diagnostic medical instruments said its sales were $785.9 million, a 2% 
increase from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings were $41.9 million, compared to $42.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter, Beckman reported earnings of $10.4 million and sales of $199.7 
million, compared to earnings of $11.2 million and sales of $199.1 million 
during the corresponding period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed its sluggish performance to declining sales to publicly 
funded laboratories and private firms. Beckman Chairman Louis Rosso said many 
corporations were spending more on research and development and less on new 
equipment during the year. He also said publicly funded research labs have 
slowed spending because of cutbacks in their funding. 
</P>
<P>
Rosso said he expected declining sales in the public sector to continue at 
least through the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The instrumentation market in the medical and scientific fields has become 
somewhat soft," said Steven Gerber, medical technology analyst with the Los 
Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.

ROYAL TRUSTCO CUTS GLENFED STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal Trustco Ltd., the Toronto financial services firm that bought the failed 
Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa, has cut its stake in Glenfed Inc. from 
9.44% to 6.7%, or 2.04 million common shares. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trustco must cut its stake in Glenfed, a savings and loan holding 
company, because federal regulation prohibits the owner of one federally 
insured S&amp;L from holding more than 5% of an S&amp;L that it does not 
control, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trustco also owns Pacific First Financial Corp. in Seattle, a savings and 
loan holding company that is managing Pacific Savings, now called Pacific First 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed is the Glendale holding company for Glendale Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trustco sold 836,400 Glenfed shares between Jan. 19 and Jan. 26 for 
$13.02 to $17.02 a share. It plans to sell enough Glenfed shares to reduce its 
stake to below 5%.

<TEXT>
<P>
Community Psychiatric Center's stock lost nearly 6.5% of its market value 
Tuesday after two major brokerages encouraged investors to sell their holdings 
just a day after the company released its annual earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills-based chain of acute psychiatric hospitals saw its stock fall 
$1.625 to close at $23.625 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The New York brokerage of Shearson Lehman Hutton reportedly changed its 
recommendation on the stock from a "hold" to a "sell" order Tuesday. 
Prudential-Bache Securities reiterated a "sell" order it sent out earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts at both firms were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerages were concerned about a slowdown in the growth of fourth-quarter 
revenue, particularly in the company's adolescent treatment units. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Community Psychiatric reported that its earnings rose 14% to $80.4 
million for its fiscal 1989 year ended Nov. 30, from $70.8 million for fiscal 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 figure includes net income from discontinued operations for nine 
months, while the 1988 figure includes 12 months from the dialysis and home 
health divisions, which were spun off in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the year increased 21% to $330.7 million, from $273.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, net earnings declined 3% to $16.5 million, from $16.9 
million for the comparable 1988 period. Revenue rose 11% to $80.1 million, from 
$72.3 million. GREGORY CROUCH

PANEL TO STUDY HOW THE ARTS PUMP UP COUNTY'S ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: IMPACT REPORTS HAVE BEEN VALUABLE TOOLS ACROSS THE U.S. TO HELP MAKE A 
CASE FOR INCREASED PUBLIC SUPPORT BY DEMONSTRATING FINANCIAL BENEFITS TO 
COMMUNITIES. L.A., FOR EXAMPLE, REAPED $5.1 BILLION IN 1985 FROM THE ARTS, A 
STUDY FOUND.

<P>
The Orange County Business Committee for the Arts is planning a study of the 
economic impact of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first survey of its kind in the county, according to local arts 
officials. Similar studies elsewhere have been used to show the fiscal benefits 
of the arts to a community and to help rally more private and public arts 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
James Doti, a professor of economics at Chapman College who will help the 
committee with the study, said he hopes to begin work on the review within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
A top official of the panel, which is set up as a nonprofit agency that 
encourages businesses to support local arts organizations, would not discuss 
the study Tuesday. Asked how the committee plans to pay for the review and when 
it hopes to release the study, executive director Betty R. Moss would say only 
that the project "is in the formation stages." 
</P>
<P>
"We are just not ready at this time to make any public statements," Moss said, 
adding that "we don't want 10,000 calls" about the study. 
</P>
<P>
She said the panel will make a public announcement about the project's progress 
after its annual board meeting Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said he is analyzing similar U.S. studies to determine the best method to 
use and "the breadth and depth" of the local survey. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that such a study would be valuable," Doti said. "I'd imagine 
that many policy makers would find it useful to find out how much of our 
region's economy is affected by the arts." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "assessing" how to keep the costs of the study to "a bare-bones 
minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Weil, director of the Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council, a 
grass-roots group working to form a countywide arts service agency, said an 
economic impact report could be "an incredibly valuable tool" to help make a 
case for local arts funding by demonstrating the financial benefit of the arts 
to the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a report can, for example, show how many jobs both directly and 
indirectly are dependent on arts activity," and the number of dollars generated 
by the arts for local businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, said Weil, an 
independent arts management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
A 1985 study by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce showed that the economic 
impact of the arts in that city that year totaled $5.1 billion. The study was 
used by city officials to help gain support for the Los Angeles Endowment for 
the Arts, a multimillion-dollar program established in 1988 that greatly 
expanded municipal arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
A similar survey recently issued in San Diego County showed that arts groups 
pump more than a quarter of a billion dollars into that economy and return $10 
to the local community for each $1 contributed. 
</P>
<P>
Roella Hsieh Louie, a grants coordinator for the Los Angeles Endowment for the 
Arts, warned, however, that an economic-impact study can be too narrow and 
"elitist." To fully understand and represent the cultural assets and needs of a 
community, social and political dynamics as well as economics must be analyzed, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Orange County arts officials should study "multiculturalism and 
(the needs) of the area's emerging ethnic groups," said Louie, who recently 
addressed a meeting of the Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council.

Demonstrators splashed the marble steps and columns of the House and Senate 
with a red liquid today in a protest of the plight of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The steps, leading to the restricted members' entrances to both chambers, are 
guarded by Capitol police, but the demonstrators rushed behind the officers to 
toss the red liquid, Officer Dan Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about noon, while scores of tourists were on the grounds, 
and hours before President Bush was to deliver his State of the Union address 
to a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Nicols said the two demonstrators face a misdemeanor charge of an act of 
physical violence against federal property. A third demonstrator was arrested 
later on charges of refusing to leave the House steps.

STUDENT DISCOVERS PIPE BOMB ON LOARA HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD

<P>
Investigators are trying to determine the origin of a pipe bomb found on the 
Loara High School football field, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was discovered Tuesday afternoon by a student as he was walking across 
the field, Anaheim Police Lt. John Haradon said. 
</P>
<P>
In what police described as a dangerous move, the student picked up the bomb 
and carried it to the school's administration office, located on the 1700 block 
of West Cerritos Avenue. School staff then notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured someone had tried to set it off the night before and had left it 
there," said Loara Principal Dr. Jerry Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Department bomb squad investigators called to the scene 
by police disposed of the device, Haradon said. Sheriff's Lt. Bill Francis 
described the pipe bomb as "a can full of powder with wires leading from both 
sides." Glenn said the bomb was about 4 inches long. He said the student picked 
up the dangerous device because he didn't know what it was.

A day after the U.S. State Department expressed concern, Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin ordered a temporary halt to the expulsion of Palestinians living 
in the occupied territories without residency permits, a practice that often 
separates husbands and wives. 
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement cited humanitarian reasons for halting the expulsions, 
which have torn apart hundreds of families in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian activists claim the expulsions have been stepped up and are part of 
a long-term strategy to force Palestinians out of the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian uprising against Israeli authority has 
claimed hundreds of lives over the last 26 months.

<P>
A Superior Court judge today denied a request to have a conservator appointed 
for actor Gary Coleman in a case involving allegations of failing mental 
health, parental greed and stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's mother, Edmonia Sue Coleman, sought to have a conservator take over 
the estate and personal affairs of her son, the diminutive former star of 
"Diff'rent Strokes." 
</P>
<P>
But based on Coleman's court appearances, the investigation of a 
court-appointed attorney and her own 30-minute interview in chambers, Judge 
Martha Goldin denied the request, ruling the 21-year-old actor "does not come 
close" to requiring a conservator to look after his affairs.

Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Church, was in 
serious condition today after emergency surgery to stop bleeding in his 
digestive system, state-run media said. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp, 61, was in intensive care at a large provincial hospital in the Praga 
section of Warsaw, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the cardinal's residence said Glemp's "state of health is 
improving." 
</P>
<P>
The official PAP news agency said President Wojciech Jaruzelski visited Glemp 
in the hospital after the surgery Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp has been primate since 1981 and a cardinal since 1983. Under his 
leadership, the church gave support to the banned Solidarity movement and 
participated in the negotiations that led to the union's legalization in April 
and eventually to the dismantling of the Communist hold on power.

BLACK ACTIVIST DIES IN SOUTH AFRICAN JAIL

A black man accused of involvement in guerrilla attacks was found hanged in his 
cell, police said today. He reportedly was a former lover of jailed black 
leader Nelson Mandela's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the police announcement, President Frederik W. de Klerk ordered 
a judicial inquiry into the death, a step not taken after scores of previous 
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers, the 20-year-old man, Clayton Sithole, was a 
former lover of Zindzi Mandela and the father of her child. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates of the family 
said they believe the report is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Sithole and four other suspected African National Congress guerrillas were 
arrested Friday in Soweto, the vast black township outside Johannesburg. Police 
accused the group of killing 10 people, including two policemen, in attacks 
with hand grenades and automatic rifles over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday in his cell at 
John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police station. The police said an 
investigation into the death had started and would include a post mortem by a 
state pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few hours of the police statement, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok 
announced that De Klerk had appointed an inquiry commission headed by a judge 
to investigate Sithole's death. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, welcomed de Klerk's move, 
saying she could not recall such a swift and emphatic response to any of the 
scores of other deaths of detainees which she has monitored in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
She said Sithole's family, who suspected the young man had been mistreated, 
would hire a pathologist of their own to conduct an independent post mortem.

A Coast Guard cutter opened fire on a 250-foot Panamanian freighter suspected 
of carrying drugs in the Gulf of Mexico today, but the vessel escaped into 
Mexican waters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The freighter Hermann took two direct hits but did not stop, said Joe Gibson, a 
Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word on injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said the Coast Guard asked the Mexican government to board the ship and 
inspect its cargo, but he had no word on whether the vessel had been 
intercepted. He said no Mexican vessels were known to be close by. 
</P>
<P>
Before firing, the Coast Guard asked Panama through diplomatic channels for 
permission to use disabling fire and it was granted, he said. The freighter 
took hits in the engine compartment and at the rudder post, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The freighter was registered in Panama and chartered by a Cuban mining company, 
but it was not known who owned it, he said. Havana complained today about the 
incident.

West German leaders today praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
apparent acceptance of reunification as a signal that may instill hope in East 
Germans fearful of the uncertainties of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the Kremlin chief's latest comments on German 
unity "encouraging," and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Gorbachev 
had "correctly analyzed" the volatile situation in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's official news agency ADN said that by making clear his change of 
mind on the German question, Gorbachev "once more confirmed for all the world 
his reputation as a politician of realism." 
</P>
<P>
Support for union with prosperous West Germany has surged among East Germans in 
recent weeks as the depths of their political and economic crises have become 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
East German Premier Hans Modrow acknowledged in a speech to Parliament this 
week that the nation was on the verge of economic collapse and said mounting 
tensions forced him to move up free elections to March 18. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,500 East Germans have been leaving each day, convinced that they 
stand a better chance starting over in the West than trying to rebuild their 
nation, driven to the brink of destruction by 40 years of Communist 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Communist sentiment has swelled among the population of 16 million, 
sparking mass demonstrations and labor strikes to protest the distrusted 
party's continued hold on the reins of power. 
</P>
<P>
A Lutheran pastor gave refuge to former leader Erich Honecker after he was 
released from prison Tuesday, and church officials reported today that their 
humanitarian action prompted insulting phone calls and threats by parishioners 
to leave the church. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, who ruled for 18 years before being forced out of office in October 
by the peaceful pro-democracy uprising, faces trial in March on a treason 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow, a reformer who is more trusted than most of his fellow Communists, was 
forced by the growing hostility toward his still-dominant party to bring nine 
opposition representatives into his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy forces joining Modrow were to submit their proposed ministers 
by today, and three of the parties publicly announced the names of the 
representatives they put forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, who were hesitant to enter into a coalition with the 
political parties blamed for East Germany's current crises, nominated Walter 
Romberg, who has not played a prominent role in the party to date.

The Philippines, rocked by a coup attempt in December, is finding it difficult 
to meet its borrowing target from foreign commercial banks for 1990, Finance 
Secretary Jesus Estanislao said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has tried to raise at least $1 billion in new money from 
commercial banks, but Estanislao told reporters he now expects to get "anywhere 
between $700 million to $750 million." 
</P>
<P>
"This is lower than I would have wanted to see because I want the Philippine 
economy to grow much faster," he said after a meeting with members of the 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time I realize now that there is very little new money for 
medium- and long-term purposes coming from the commercial banks in the 
international markets," he added.

ECONOMIC GAUGE UP 0.8%; RECESSION DANGER DECLINES

<P>
The government's main economic forecasting gauge rose a robust 0.8% in 
December, the Commerce Department said today in a report indicating that the 
nation's sluggish economy can skirt a recession in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in the index of leading economic indicators followed a tiny 0.1% gain 
in November and a 0.3% decline in October. It was the largest increase since a 
similar 0.8% advance last April. 
</P>
<P>
The index, composed of 11 forward-looking statistics designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months into the future, was the latest indication 
that the economy, while weak, can avoid an actual decline in growth. 
</P>
<P>
The December report showed the index up just 0.4% for the year, contrasted with 
an increase of 3.9% for all of 1988. It suggests that economic activity this 
year could be more sluggish than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the statistics contributed to the December gain, led by an increase in 
the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders. 
</P>
<P>
Others showing strength were an increase in plant and equipment orders, higher 
stock prices, a rise in the money supply, an increase in building permits and a 
gain in an index measuring consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drag on the index last month was a drop in the price of raw 
materials. While such a decrease is considered good news for inflation 
prospects, it is counted as a negative in the index because it can also reflect 
declining demand. 
</P>
<P>
Other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a decline in 
orders for consumer goods and a speedup in business delivery times. 
</P>
<P>
The average workweek was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
In advance of the report, some analysts had suggested that the current 
sluggishness is akin to flirting with a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we're very, very close," said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic 
adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "I mean, we're as close to being 
in a recession without being in one as you can be." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chimerine and other economists found themselves agreeing with 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told Congress on Tuesday that, 
while he "wouldn't want to bet the ranch," he thinks the economy will avoid a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Growth through much of 1989 was restrained by high interest rates resulting 
from the Fed's efforts to slow inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit.

Northwest Airlines said today it will spend $422 million over the next five 
years to try to bring more flights in on time, improve in-flight food and 
redecorate its 300 planes. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest President Fred Malek said Northwest, the country's fourth-largest 
airline, wants to become the first choice of more travelers by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Malek did not divulge results of market surveys on how Northwest fares among 
competitors currently, but said the results were "not too good." 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes spending $100 million to serve more meals and add choices to 
the standard fare. About an equal amount will be spent to step up maintenance 
capability and increase spare parts inventories, cutting down on delays due to 
mechanical problems, Malek said.

Sharkey is researching a movie that deals with the Mafia, his publicist told 
the Post. 
</P>
<P>
He wished Gotti, 49, good luck, and Gotti called Sharkey "a good friend of 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
Noting reporters' surprise, Gotti said, smiling, "What do you think, Bruce 
Cutler is my only friend?" Cutler, Gotti's attorney, is defending him on 
charges he ordered the shooting of a union official who allegedly trashed a 
mob-owned restaurant built with non-union labor.

Actor Michael Keaton, the househusband in "Mr. Mom," the cruddy afterlife 
creature in "Beetlejuice" and the caped crusader in "Batman," has filed for

"Michael doesn't comment on his personal life," Keaton publicist Paul Bloch 
said Tuesday in response to the report in this week's issue. 
</P>
<P>
Keaton, 38, and his wife, actress Caroline McWilliams, 44, were married seven 
years ago and have a 6-year-old son, Sean. McWilliams starred in the film

POP STAR BILLY JOEL GIVES MUSIC STUDENTS PEP TALK

<P>
Billy Joel once regretted becoming a singer and songwriter, he said, but his 
doubt "lasted about five seconds." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird gig, there are no two ways about it," the pop star told about 800 
students in a master's class at Philadelphia's The University of the Arts on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask yourself a lot of times if you should be doing something else, 
maybe you should." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old singer, in town for a concert series, made a guest appearance 
at the university to talk about songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Joel told the students they should ignore those who ask, "When are you going to 
get a real job?" "Most artists have had to overlook a lot of that kind of 
pressure," he said. "You do what you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Of his precedent-setting 1987 tour of the Soviet Union, Joel said he noticed 
that Russian kids have an affinity for heavy metal. "All of our (pop) music 
comes from the black experience. . . . their music is from suffering. Heavy 
metal is the music of frustration. That's a frustrating life over there." 
</P>
<P>
Joel said the Soviet tour was "my greatest thrill as a performer" but he 
probably won't be going back because foreign performers are paid in rubles, 
which can not be taken out of the country and "you can't buy anything with them 
in the country."

'LOST' MARX SCRIPTS DRAW FANS

<P>
Fans of the Marx Brothers lined up in the rain to pack a London studio for the 
first public performance in almost 60 years of radio scripts written by the 
manic American comedy team. 
</P>
<P>
The scripts for "Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel," a series about an 
unscrupulous lawyer, were believed lost until they were discovered a year ago 
by a researcher in the Library of Congress in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. bought exclusive performance rights. It recorded 
the first of the series on Tuesday night to rapturous applause from the 
capacity studio audience and will broadcast it later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
British actor Mike Roberts played Groucho Marx playing lawyer Flywheel, 
complete with Groucho's trademark boot-polish mustache and large cigar. Another 
Briton, Frank Lazarus, played Chico Marx playing Flywheel's sidekick Ravelli. 
Because it was a radio show, there was no part for brother Harpo, who was 
always mute in the Marx films. 
</P>
<P>
The series, made for Standard Oil, was broadcast in 1932 in the United States 
but was not recorded. 
</P>
<P>
BBC producer Dirk Maggs said: "They have never been heard since they were first 
produced and finding the scripts was like finding Tutankhamen's tomb."

<TEXT>
<P>
A Miami woman is suing Julio Iglesias on the grounds that he defrauded her of 
royalties from a song they wrote together. 
</P>
<P>
Grecia (Mimi) Korman wants $50,000 in damages, plus interest, court costs and 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
Korman says that in 1978 Iglesias asked her to help write a Spanish adaptation 
of the French song "J'ai Oublie de Vivre" ("I've Forgotten to Live"). She says 
she worked with some of his preliminary lyrics and a month later presented him 
with a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
The song appeared on at least seven albums with Korman and Iglesias listed as 
co-writers, but Korman says Iglesias entered into a contract with the French 
publishers of the song, presenting himself as the sole writer.

LIZ SMITH: NANCY REAGAN'S TURN ON PHOENIX HOUSE FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Reagan is fed up with the magazines Vanity Fair and Los Angeles and with 
this column for comments about her "backing out of her support" for the Phoenix 
House drug program. She says, "Enough already!" 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan insists she did not "defect" or "back out" of this project, which 
was to build a drug treatment center in L.A. (Activists who didn't want the 
center in their neighborhood threatened to picket the Reagan house in Bel-Air.) 
Mrs. Reagan says she simply took her name off the project because she 
reconsidered and because she felt she was overextended and exhausted. She had 
just suffered a bout with pneumonia at that time, which very few people 
realize. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Nancy Reagan: "I returned to California and found out how strongly 
local people here felt about the center being built. It just did not seem 
feasible for me to go on. I had already raised $5 million for Dr. Mitch 
Rosenthal and the Phoenix House. I did not take any of this money for my own 
foundation; I tried to secure it all for Phoenix House. And, as for the few who 
pledged who tried to erase their pledges after I withdrew my name -- well, I 
have worked hard to convince them not to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not withdraw support from the program. I left Phoenix House with all 
that money I had raised. I have never said a word against the Phoenix House, 
which is a great program, nor against Mitch. But, you know, I can't do 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized at the time I was spreading myself too thin. Now I don't believe I 
deserve all this negative publicity when I have worked so hard. I do wish Grant 
Tinker and others who are so exercised had called me before issuing statements. 
I never thought that the 'just say no' slogan would solve the drug problem. How 
silly! It was simply a phrase that caught on, but certainly there is much more 
to do about drugs. Public education and treatment centers are the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me, where does one working for these good causes draw the line? My own 
drug foundation has already given 13 grants, and I am still going to schools 
and centers talking to children and to young people all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked against drugs for eight years in the White House and I will continue. 
But I don't think I deserve to be in the spot the Phoenix House supporters -- 
and the press -- have put me for having decided I was doing too much and for 
removing my name from the building of the L.A. treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
"I am all for everything Tina Brown and Grant Tinker and others can do for 
Phoenix House. If they raise a lot of money from their March 22 gala in 
California, that will be wonderful. . . . But I am tired of being blamed for 
not having done enough myself." 
</P>
<P>
THE HOTTEST strip of celluloid these days is a simple little story about an old 
woman and a black man who becomes her friend. The amazing "Driving Miss Daisy" 
not only won all those recent awards and critical raves, it aced out Tom Cruise 
and "Born on the Fourth of July" for the top box office spot last week. Soon, 
Lili and Richard Zanuck and their partner, Jerry Perenchio, will take the 
Jessica Tandy-Morgan Freeman-Dan Aykroyd movie to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Zanuck Co. is aglow, just like in the good old days. They have "Daisy's" 
playwright, Alfred Uhry, writing their next film, based on Josephine Humphrey's 
novel "Rich in Love," another tale set in the South. 
</P>
<P>
And they have the talented Robert Towne to write and direct another sizzler. 
They paid a million dollars to novelist Kim Rozencraft for her book "Rush," all 
about an undercover narcotics agent in Texas. Now Tom Cruise is interested in 
starring in it.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has named her week-old daughter Bakhtawar, which 
means "one who brings luck" in Persian, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The second child of Bhutto and her husband, Azif Zardari, was born Jan. 25 in 
the southern port city of Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was the first elected leader of a modern government to give birth while 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old prime minister's first child, a son named Bilawal, was born 
Sept. 21, 1988, two months before the first free elections in 11 years that 
installed Bhutto as prime minister. Bhutto campaigned until the final days 
before Bilawal's birth and was back on the hustings a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before her daughter's birth, the prime minister traveled to a dusty 
rural village near Karachi to distribute thousands of acres of government land 
to peasants. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders were critical of the prime minister's decision to have a 
second child, claiming that the country would be leaderless while she 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto transferred authority to her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, a senior minister 
without portfolio, elected member of the National Assembly and co-chairperson 
of the populist Pakistan People's Party.

<P>
In a week when repeats and three-peats have become the prevailing topic in pro 
sports, golfer Mark O'Meara will take his shot at deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara is the defending champion at this week's Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, 
which begins Thursday over the Pebble Beach, Cypress Point and Spyglass 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, who had his best season on the tour last year with earnings of 
$615,804, sank a 10-foot birdie putt on the final hole at Pebble Beach last 
year to edge Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
One of the leading money winners on the tour the past six years, O'Meara said 
today beating Kite and the other 178 pros in this week's field is a tougher 
assignment than what Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers faced in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers can do it, but it's a little tougher out here," he said. There's a 
hundred and eighty guys trying to win this tournament. The competition is 
getting tougher every year." 
</P>
<P>
The challengers this year include Paul Azinger, Peter Jacobsen and Tommy Armour 
III, winners of three of the four tour events so far this season. Azinger won 
the Tournament of Champions, Jacobsen ended a six-year drought with a win at 
the Bob Hope Classic and Armour scored a five-shot win last week at the Phoenix 
Open.

EMMITT SMITH OPTS TO ENTER NFL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SCOUTS RATE FLORIDA JUNIOR TAILBACK AMONG TOP PROSPECTS AND A CERTAIN 
FIRST-ROUND PICK.

<P>
Florida tailback Emmitt Smith today became the fifth prominent college 
underclassman to give up his college eligibility in a bid for this year's NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
The teary-eyed junior informed his parents, teammates and Coach Steve Spurrier 
of his decision not to return for his senior year shortly before a news 
conference and said he was giving up his chase for the Heisman Trophy to pursue 
an "opportunity of a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
"Every guy has a dream of being in the NFL. I'm not going to stand here and 
give you a sob story about my family needing money because I feel like they 
don't really need money," Smith said. "It's a personal goal of mine and I want 
to achieve it in the best way possible. 
</P>
<P>
"This past season has helped me increase my stock (in the draft) and I don't 
want to risk the chance of decreasing it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith rushed for 1,599 yards and 14 touchdowns last fall and finished the 
season with 3,928 career yards -- fifth on the SEC's all-time list -- and 36 
touchdowns. He holds 56 school records, including rushing yards and TDs, and 
finished ninth in the Heisman balloting as a freshman and seventh in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I'd be standing here after three years saying I'm leaving to 
go to the NFL," he said. "But I felt like last season is the best I've had in 
college, and I'm the healthiest I've been. I didn't win the Heisman and I 
didn't win a (SEC) championship, but I feel I've done everything I could do 
except graduate." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-feet 10-inch, 202-pound tailback plans to remain in school this semester 
and vowed to return to obtain his degree between pro seasons. Smith did not 
face a deadline to declare himself eligible for the NFL until later in the 
spring, but said he wanted to end speculation about his future so he could 
enjoy life as a student again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hectic for myself and my family," he said, adding that he made up 
his mind to leave Florida last weekend but did not reveal his plans until just 
before the news conference he arranged on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith joins Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, Arkansas fullback Barry Foster, 
Georgia tailback Rodney Hampton and former Tennessee running back Reggie Cobb 
in publicly declaring for the NFL draft. However, he said he has been told that 
nearly 40 college juniors have petitioned for early entry to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
NFL scouts rate Smith as one of the top running back prospects and a certain 
first-round pick. The tailback said he has not signed with an agent and did not 
consult with anyone about his value in the draft before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft's been very strange the last three years, very unpredictable," he 
said, adding that he does not have a preference for where he wants to play in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to play anywhere I'm drafted. I just want to play."

BRETT STUNS ALL WITH SHARP DEMAND FOR MORE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CAMERON, KANSAS CITY STAR AND TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas City Royals superstar George Brett has stunned his employers, teammates 
and fans with a sharply worded demand for a heftier contract. 
</P>
<P>
Brett's remarks, which became public after an interview with the Spokane 
(Wash.) 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman-Review, included a suggestion that he should be traded if the Royals 
will not renegotiate his current deal of $1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Brett also listed six teams -- Los Angeles, Boston, St. Louis, San Diego, Texas 
and the Chicago Cubs -- he would be willing to play for if the Royals want to 
trade him rather than pay him. 
</P>
<P>
Brett signed a so-called lifetime deal in 1984, an arrangement that includes a 
$1.5-million salary through 1991 with options for two years beyond that. 
Real-estate deals and other considerations were included that would keep Brett 
on the Royals' payroll indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
But Brett, 36, apparently has been chafing over huge salaries being paid to 
players without records approaching his own. So last Friday, on a business trip 
to Spokane, Brett made his demands known to the Spokesman-Review, which ran the 
story Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that, yeah, I did sign a contract," Brett was quoted as saying. 
"I've got to play out that contract, and I will honor that contract, but right 
now I'm not looking forward to going to spring training unless my attitude 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Brett characterized his relationship with the Royals as shaky and said the 
contract problems are disturbing his off-season conditioning routine. 
</P>
<P>
Royals General Manager John Schuerholz confirmed that he had spoken with both 
Brett and his agent-brother Bobby in a frantic 24-hour period that began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to George very briefly," Schuerholz said. "At the moment, that's all 
I will say on the subject. I intend to talk to him again."

McLaren, whose cars have won world championships in four of the last six 
seasons, has been feuding with FISA since November when Senna was fined for 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, FISA President Jean-Marie Balestre said Senna will not be granted a 
license to compete in Formula One unless he retracts allegations that last 
year's championship was manipulated in favor of Frenchman Alain Prost, at the 
time his McLaren teammate. Senna, a Brazilian, won the 1988 drivers' world 
championship but finished second last year to Prost, who moved to Ferrari at 
the end of the season.

San Francisco 49ers cornerback Tim McKyer suffered minor injuries in a traffic 
accident Tuesday while he was en route to the Super Bowl champions' training 
camp for their final season meeting. 
</P>
<P>
McKyer, 26, was treated at the Stanford University Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said the defensive back was alone in his auto on 
Interstate 280 when he made a lane change, triggering an accident involving two 
other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Glenn Wood said there was no alcohol or drugs involved in the crash. 
"The roadway was wet, and it was drizzling at the time of the accident," Wood 
added.

BASEBALL MYTHS; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T TRY TO HIT A RISING FASTBALL WITH A CORK BAT, PHYSICIST SAYS 
</P>

Cork-filled bats are nothing for pitchers to fear, there is no such thing as a 
rising fastball and ground balls do not pick up speed bouncing over artificial 
turf, says a Yale physicist in a book that gives a scientist's spin on 
America's favorite pastime. 
</P>
<P>
"The flight of balls, the liveliness of balls, the structure of bats and the 
character of the collision of balls and bats are a natural province of physics 
and physicists," says Robert K. Adair in "The Physics of Baseball," published 
this month by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
But "in all sports analyses, it is important for a scientist to avoid hubris 
and pay careful attention to the athletes," writes Adair before stepping up to 
the plate with his calculations, worked out mostly on a personal computer using 
simple BASIC programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If players think they hit better after illegally drilling a hole in their bat 
and filling it with cork, they must be taken seriously. The reason they give 
for their 'improvement,' however, may not be valid." 
</P>
<P>
Adair wrote the book at the urging of the late Bart Giamatti, who, as president 
of the National League, had asked his old Yale friend in 1987 to advise him on 
a few elements of baseball physics. Declining to be a paid consultant, Adair 
instead was bestowed with the title "Physicist to the National League." 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings he reported to Giamatti, who later became baseball 
commissioner, were that illegally modifying a baseball bat by drilling a hole 
in it and stuffing cork or rubber inside is, in effect, a crime without a 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Adair, who compared the weight and other characteristics of a Louisville 
Slugger before and after it had been filled with cork, concluded that the 
illegal modification provides the hitter no benefit that he cannot generally 
obtain through a legally constructed bat. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he found that while drilling a hole in the bat will make it lighter, 
the energy of the cork or rubber used as a filler cannot be effectively 
transferred to the ball. Therefore, the extra material will only slow the bat 
down a little, slightly reducing the distance the bat hits the ball. 
</P>
<P>
For fans who take their statistics seriously, the 106-page book places a whole 
new realm of intriguing facts and figures at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, did you know that: 
</P>
<P>
* There is no such thing as a rising fastball. Backspin on a ball will only 
make it fall less than it would otherwise as it crosses the plate. As far as 
the hitter is concerned, however, "it's real and not an illusion" because it is 
seen as a higher pitch, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
* Ground balls cannot possibly speed up as they bounce across artificial turf 
infields. Long home runs are typically hit so the initial backspin is near 
2,000 r.p.m., and ground balls have similar rates of overspin. Ground balls 
would not speed up even with an overspin as great as 4,000 r.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* From the perspective of the batter or pitcher, a wide-breaking curve ball 
thrown at 70 m.p.h. with a counterclockwise spin rate of 1,600 r.p.m. and aimed 
toward the inside corner has curved 14.4 inches to pass over the outside 
corner. But the largest deviation from a straight line from beginning to end is 
only 3.4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
* Large hands and strong wrists do not a long-ball hitter make. The 
contribution of the hands and wrists to the energy of the bat is almost 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
* The collision of a ball on the bat lasts only about 1/1,000th of a second. 
But the force on a ball hit for a long home run reaches a value of nearly 8,000 
pounds, compressing the ball to about half its original diameter. 
</P>
<P>
* A humid day at the ballpark will not necessarily turn home-run balls into 
long outs. Humidity, in and of itself, has little effect on the ball's flight, 
since water vapor is actually a little lighter than air. Balls stored under 
conditions of high humidity, however, will gain some weight through the 
absorption of water and their elasticity will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a look at the reputed advantages of aluminum bats, Adair concludes that 
they "will surely hit a ball appreciably farther than a wooden bat." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of how far a baseball can be hit, Adair joins others who have 
questioned the accuracy of accounts that said Mickey Mantle hit a ball 565 feet 
in 1953 and Babe Ruth sent a baseball traveling 600 feet in 1919. According to 
his calculations, the maximum distance a ball can be hit is 450 feet under 
normal conditions and 550 feet when other conditions are taken into account.

<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER BATTLING DRUGS AND DEPRESSION, THE FORMER DODGER SHORTSTOP 
FINALLY FEELS PART OF A TEAM -- AND IMPORTANT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Maury Wills was about to tee off at Los Coyotes Golf Course when he saw a 
camera crew trudging toward him. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dodger Day at the Buena Park course, that October day in 1972. So Wills 
thought the camera crew was coming to interview him, to get a look at his 
swing. You know, do one of those cute features. 
</P>
<P>
Wills hit a strong drive down the middle of the fairway and, when he looked up, 
the camera was rolling. Feeling proud, he strode to the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"Maury," the reporter said, "you've just been released by the Dodgers. Do you 
have any comments?" 
</P>
<P>
Wills was shaken, his insides screamed and his mind began to race. He said all 
of the right things, but the words didn't come from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
This was exactly the way Wills had not wanted it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't the Dodgers assured him they would tell him in advance, that he wouldn't 
find out from the media, or from a car radio? Maybe he would even have a news 
conference, as Willie Mays and some other players had. Hadn't the Dodgers 
assured him of that? 
</P>
<P>
And then, resentment set in. 
</P>
<P>
"The best years of my life, genetically speaking, were when I was young, 
productive and strong, performing away at life and trying to perfect 
something," Wills said of being released. 
</P>
<P>
"But for the amount of time I really enjoyed, the rewards are very few. And 
now, I'm on my way down, going through hell, trying to hold on as an older 
player. And now, I'm out of the game and I'm trying to make this transition, 
and they don't need me anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Some baseball players, after their career, go on to have nice normal 
productive lives, but a lot of us fall prey to disaster, because (life after 
baseball) is the (real) big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Wills spent 8 1/2 years in the minor leagues before he made it to the majors. 
In 1959, he was called up by the Dodgers to replace injured shortstop Don 
Zimmer. The Dodgers traded him to Pittsburgh in 1967, and he also played 47 
games for Montreal before returning to the Dodgers in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
As hard as Wills worked at being a player, he has struggled far more since his 
playing days. Merely trying to deal with life. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, merely trying to get through a day. 
</P>
<P>
 If I could do it all over again I might change it and be something else. If I 
could look in a crystal ball, maybe I wouldn't have worked so hard to be as 
good as I was. Maybe it wouldn't have been so important to me to win. Because 
the reward of the ring and the World Series share does not measure up to the 
disaster that I have been through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maury Wills, Jan. 18, 1990 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as though he became impoverished, unless poverty is measured as a 
lack of contentment. By 1981, Maury Wills as poor. 
</P>
<P>
He had been the most exciting player on the base paths since Jackie Robinson. 
In 1962, Wills won the league's most-valuable-player award when he stole 104 
bases, breaking Ty Cobb's record of 96 set in 1915. Most baseball experts agree 
that Wills' baserunning style revived base stealing as a major offensive weapon 
and made him a legend in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
His next endeavor, as a broadcaster, also was successful. He was a baseball 
commentator with NBC for six years and then spent another year as the co-host 
for his own show on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980, his boyhood dream of being a manager came true, with the Seattle 
Mariners. This time, however, he was not a success. And when he was fired by 
Seattle after 82 games, on May 6, 1981, Wills says he became a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
For 3 1/2 years, he rarely ventured from his bedroom, the master suite in his 
14-room house in Playa Del Rey. He sat alone, day after day, in total darkness, 
using drugs and alcohol. Somehow, cocaine made him feel right, and made 
everybody else wrong. 
</P>
<P>
At night, he stared at the Pacific Ocean through the big bay window in his 
bedroom until he saw imaginary people looking in on him. Then he put the 
blankets up, leaving them there all day to keep the sunshine out. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when things got real bad, he would find some old black and white 
photographs of himself as a ballplayer, and, in the stillness of the night, he 
could even hear the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
But the cheers had long since turned to jeers and criticism. As a manager, he 
had not only failed in the won-lost column, but in his ability to communicate 
with his players, coaches and the media. He had been erratic and troubled, and 
it reflected on his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Wills now says his troubles were triggered by a broken romance. He says the 
love of his life, whom he declined to identify, broke up with him and ran off 
with another ballplayer, someone Wills had introduced her to. It made him 
crazy. He couldn't concentrate, and he was obsessed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget," Wills said. "I was in Milwaukee in this big suite in the 
hotel. There were rooms all over the place and I'm the major league manager, 
and I cried myself to sleep all night long. Everyone I called back here in 
California that I needed to talk to, I couldn't reach. I couldn't reach her. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time when my disease is surfacing, I'm getting into depression now . 
. . and my irregular behavior is beginning to develop and is coming on." 
</P>
<P>
"So now I go back (to Los Angeles) and the season is over and I can't find her, 
and I went crazy all winter." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after spring training began, in 1981, Wills learned that the woman had 
run off with the ballplayer. He says that pushed him over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Wills says he also became "acquainted" with the drug scene that winter before 
spring training. But he says he did not start using drugs until after he was 
fired by Seattle, three weeks into the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Humiliated and embarrassed, Wills locked himself up in his house. 
</P>
<P>
Then in August, 1983, Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, and 
Don Newcombe, former Dodger pitcher, took Wills to a substance-abuse center. 
Wills didn't want to be recognized, so he registered under an assumed name, 
Donald Claire. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been there about 10 days, and I wasn't really participating, I was just 
there," Wills said. "The first time that I was in a group discussion with other 
patients, I wouldn't look the leader in the eye, because I didn't want to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it was finally my turn to talk. I got a lump in my throat and tears 
welled up in my eyes and I stood up and said, 'First of all, I have to admit to 
you that my name really isn't Donald Claire.' And the whole group looked up and 
said, 'No kidding, Maury!' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a 28-day program, but Wills lasted only 25. He went back to his house 
and locked himself up. And when he ventured out, he got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 27, 1983, Wills, driving a car that had been reported as stolen, was 
stopped and arrested for possessing an estimated $7 worth of cocaine. The auto 
theft charge was dropped by the car's owner, reportedly a friend of Wills, who 
said she had not known that Wills had borrowed her car. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, 1984, the drug possession charge was dismissed because of 
insufficient evidence. But the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
 People say, "Oh yeah, he's OK now. Well, how long is that going to last?" That 
is so cruel. There are no guarantees. I am fighting the greatest battle of my 
life now, and maybe it's what I need to keep me busy. It's an everyday, all-day 
job. I'll never get well, I'll only get better. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maury Wills 
</P>
<P>
Maury Wills says he is clean today -- clean as in drug- and alcohol-free -- and 
he says he has been clean for six consecutive months. He says that is the 
longest time he has been clean since he started using drugs in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
That first trip to the care center was the beginning of many such trips for 
Wills, who is now tested weekly at the Community Health Projects clinic and is 
in therapy with Dr. Joan Elvidge. The Dodgers pay Wills' rehabilitation 
expenses, and weekly reports are sent to Claire. 
</P>
<P>
Wills is working as a public-relations agent for Cellular Dynamics Telephone 
Company in Inglewood. He plays golf, has lunch and sign autographs for clients. 
He says he feels a part of the work team, the first time he has ever felt a 
part of any group. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt a part of it as a major league baseball star, " Wills said. "I 
had 90,000 people in the Coliseum cheering, 'Go! Go! Go!' and at Dodger Stadium 
there were 56,000 and another 2,000 in the parking lot waiting for my autograph 
after the game. And I've gone home and cried myself to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's so important to me to show I am really involved with this 
company. I'm not somebody they (the company) are exploiting, putting out there 
and pasting up like with so many athletes -- with car dealerships and such. 
It's not like that here at all." 
</P>
<P>
Wills, along with Mike Celizic, a writer for the Bergen (N.J.) Record, is also 
writing a book that is expected to be published in June. 
</P>
<P>
At 57, Wills appears to be as fit as ever. He still has that gray patch of hair 
in front, but now it blends in better. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Wills says, for maybe the first time in his life, he is finding 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, I left God, He didn't leave me," said Wills, whose 
father was a Baptist minister. "When I played, I used to thank God for every 
stolen base, every hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, as long as I have God with me, to guide me and love me, as long as I stay 
in contact with God, I will love myself and be good to myself this time, and 
not let myself fall prey to things again. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how to recognize danger signs of things that are not good for me and I 
don't involve myself with it. I go into things now with my partner, my higher 
power." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things Wills tries to stay away from is talk of his failure to be 
elected to the Hall of Fame. Eligible since 1978, Wills came closest to 
election in 1979, when he received 166 votes, or 51%. That year, 324 votes were 
needed for election. 
</P>
<P>
The votes are cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
To be elected, a player must receive 75% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to make a conscious effort to try to stay clean and sober just to get 
through the voting period -- if that's what made the difference -- so that 
maybe I could be elected," Wills said. "But not making it affected my 
self-esteem, and, as each time went by, I would sink more and more." 
</P>
<P>
The number of votes cast for Wills dropped significantly after he was fired by 
the Mariners -- from 163 votes in 1981 to 91 in 1982. The most he has received 
since is 127 in 1988 -- after a period during which Wills was somewhat visible 
again in the baseball community, although mainly at baseball card shows. Each 
of the last two years, Wills has received 95 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't received much consideration on Hall of Fame voting, and one thing 
that hurt him was his problems as a manager," said Allen Lewis, who covered the 
Phillies for the Philadelphia Inquirer when Wills was a player, and who is also 
a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably unfair to penalize him as a player for what happened to him as a 
manager, but people are human. He didn't play that long, perhaps too few 
outstanding years to get him in (as an overall player). But he influenced the 
game without question, and if he makes it, it would be because he helped change 
the game and made speed important." 
</P>
<P>
If Wills fails to make the Hall of Fame in the next two years, he will have to 
wait three years before he can be considered for election by the Veteran's 
Committee, which is composed of 18 members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wills says, he beginning to seriously doubt that he will ever be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about Maury Wills that bothers people and diminishes their 
respect for me, and I don't know what it is, but it has always been this way," 
Wills said. "Maybe it's that I was arrogant and cocky. But it has been a part 
of the problem and helped to contribute to my behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not healthy for me to try to take someone else's inventory and think, 
'Why?' I had to let go of wanting to be in baseball in some capacity and let go 
of wanting to be in the Hall of Fame. I had to surrender and this is what 
helped me to get turned around. There is less rejection this way and a lot of 
my fears have left me." 
</P>
<P>
Wills doesn't think he is capable of having an intimate relationship again. 
"Relationships and sex, that's what got me messed up in the first place," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Wills also no longer aspires to a managing career, but he would like to be an 
instructor. He believes that he is one of the best instructors on baserunning 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
He would be content, he says, simply to spend a few weeks a season working with 
players. He doesn't need any more than that now, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position where having a higher power in my life allows me to have 
clarity, and gives me the acceptance to feel a part of it now," Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in situations where people have been raving over me, but that is 
Maury Wills the baseball player, the base stealer. Nobody ever knew Maury Wills 
personally. I didn't even know myself because I got wrapped up in the hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, all the years that I was highly acclaimed, somehow, I was always 
reminded that still, I was just a nigger, just a baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is merely Maury Wills, hoping that being Maury Wills is enough.
