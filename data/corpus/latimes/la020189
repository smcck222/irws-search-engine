UTILITY MERGER STRONGLY OPPOSED BY SAN DIEGANS

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans are strongly opposed to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s proposed 
merger with Southern California Edison, but they also have serious doubts about 
a public takeover of the utility, a Times poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, however, nearly half of those questioned said they are undecided 
about SDG&amp;E's merger plans, despite months of acrimonious public debate. 
The large percentage of undecided residents offers advocates of both the merger 
and the buyout an opportunity to mobilize support behind their respective 
proposals in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the poll suggests that SDG&amp;E and Edison executives may face a 
tougher selling job than supporters of a public takeover of the utility by the 
San Diego County Water Authority. Among San Diegans who have made up their 
minds on the issue, the merger is opposed by a 4-to-1 margin, while the public 
buyout option was disapproved by only a very narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor for those who are undecided will be which option is more likely 
to produce lower utility rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merger vs. Buyout 
</P>
<P>
When asked which alternative they would prefer if rates were guaranteed to go 
down, the poll's respondents favored the merger over the buyout by 45% to 28%. 
Concern that governments are ill-equipped to run utilities -- raising the 
specter of higher rates -- was the major reason cited in opposition to 
municipalization of SDG&amp;E. However, by a 3-to-2 margin, those polled also 
expressed skepticism about the likelihood of utility rates being reduced under 
an Edison takeover. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's historical anti-Los Angeles bent surfaced as one of the major 
reasons why people oppose SDG&amp;E's merger with Rosemead-based Edison. 
Disapproval of the public buyout plan, meanwhile, stemmed in part from the 
widespread concern that municipalization would increase bureaucracy and be an 
unwelcome government incursion into private business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that San Diegans have over the years consistently criticized 
SDG&amp;E for high rates and mismanagement, the poll showed that, by a more 
than 4-to-1 margin, people prefer its present structure to either the merger or 
a public buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"If people had their druthers, SDG&amp;E would stay the same and these two 
other proposals would just go away," Times pollster I.A. Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday of 719 people 
throughout San Diego County. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or 
minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Public sentiment won't determine whether or not the merger occurs, but it will 
be an important backdrop to the Public Utilities Commission's review of the 
SDG&amp;E-Edison deal. The public's attitude also could influence the position 
taken by local politicians on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of both the merger and a public buyout said they were encouraged by 
the poll's findings. Not surprisingly, both sides also argued that the results 
bode ill for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing that comes through in those numbers is that the public doesn't 
want this merger with Edison," said San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who has 
vigorously opposed the proposed merger since it was announced last fall. "The 
fact that people are most interested in what happens to rates also is good from 
the standpoint of a public takeover. If people vote their pocketbooks, that's a 
battle we'll win." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Michael Peevey, Edison's executive vice president, dismissed 
the strong opposition to the merger as "not very surprising, given the 
hostility of some politicians and other people" who, he contends, have 
dominated public debate on the subject so far. Predicting that the opposition 
will lessen "when we make our case," Peevey drew encouragement from the poll's 
finding that San Diegans prefer the merger over a buyout, assuming both options 
would insure lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
"That's extremely pleasing, because what it says is, all things being equal, 
the public would like to see SDG&amp;E stay under private ownership," Peevey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With extensive governmental reviews of SDG&amp;E's future ownership just 
beginning, the Times poll showed that those studies, which could last as long 
as two years, have an enormous potential for shaping public attitudes. 
Forty-five percent of those questioned said they neither support nor oppose the 
$2.4-billion buyout offer from Edison's parent company, SCEcorp., while 50% 
were undecided about the possible public takeover by the County Water 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lopsided Margin 
</P>
<P>
However, among those who have made a decision, the merger faces overwhelming 
opposition, although attitudes toward municipalization are relatively evenly 
split, the poll revealed. SDG&amp;E's merger with Edison was opposed by a 
lopsided 44%-11% margin, with two-thirds of the opponents saying they "strongly 
disapprove" of the merger. In contrast, the possibility of a public takeover of 
SDG&amp;E drew a 27%-23% negative response. 
</P>
<P>
The merger's potential impact on local utility rates was the major explanation 
offered both in its support and opposition. Asked for the most important reason 
why they approve of the merger, 56% of the respondents said they believe that 
it would produce lower rates. On the other hand, 49% of the merger's opponents 
said they fear that Edison's takeover of SDG&amp;E would raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
Rates played an equally significant role in determining attitudes toward the 
municipalization proposal, with 43% of that plan's backers arguing that public 
ownership of SDG&amp;E would lower rates, making that response the No. 1 
answer. Among opponents of municipalization, 23% said they believe utility 
rates would increase under public ownership, a finding that ranked third in 
that category. 
</P>
<P>
The two leading objections to a public takeover, the poll found, are the belief 
that governments are ineffective in running utilities and that municipalization 
would increase government bureaucracy, answers offered by 53% and 35% of the 
respondents, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Another 16% described the public takeover plan as inappropriate government 
interference in private business, 10% said it would reduce local governments' 
tax revenues and 6% predicted it would lower the community's charitable 
donations by removing a major corporate donor. In regard to another question, 
public officials' plans to spend more than a million dollars in taxpayer money 
to study the feasibility of municipalization was opposed by a 37%-20% margin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Municipalization Issues 
</P>
<P>
Behind lower rates, the next most important reasons given in support of 
municipalization were that public officials might be more responsive than 
private utility executives (40%) and that it would help protect local jobs 
(30%). 
</P>
<P>
The merger proposal, meanwhile, drew strong support from people who said they 
believe that larger companies generally are more efficient and that Edison has 
access to more reliable energy supplies than SDG&amp;E -- answers that again 
reflect hopes that the merger would generate lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's longstanding antagonism toward Los Angeles was strongly reflected 
in the attitudes of merger opponents. The prospect of a Los Angeles-area 
company controlling a San Diego utility was cited by 46% of those questioned as 
the major reason they oppose the merger, making that factor second only to 
rates. Another 28% said they disapprove of the merger because they believe it 
would eliminate local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The obstacles faced by Edison's public-relations campaign aimed at winning over 
converts to the merger plan were illustrated by a poll finding that many San 
Diegans distrust the company. Although Edison executives have pledged to seek a 
10% rate reduction for existing SDG&amp;E customers within six months of 
approval of the merger, the poll showed that, by a 49%-33% margin, people do 
not take the company at its word on that promise. Similarly, only 5% of those 
surveyed expressed a favorable impression of Edison, compared to 24% for 
SDG&amp;E and 12% for the County Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that, although the merger-versus-buyout debate has been 
Page 1 news for months, it is far from the top item on the public's agenda. 
When asked to list the problems that they believe should receive public 
officials' top priority, the utility issue ranked fourth, with only 10%, 
preceded by crime (45%), the homeless (17%) and sewage (12%). 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the turnaround in public attitudes toward SDG&amp;E, the poll 
detected a longing for preservation of the status quo with the utility -- an 
option recently described by San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts as "getting 
the toothpaste back in the tube." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they favor keeping SDG&amp;E as it is, approving the merger or 
proceeding with a public buyout, 58% of the respondents expressed a preference 
for not changing SDG&amp;E's ownership. Given that choice, only 14% said they 
view the merger as the best alternative and 12% favored a public buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"What that tells the politicians is that the smartest thing would be to oppose 
everything," pollster Lewis said. "The status quo may not really be an option 
any longer, but it's obvious that that's what people would like to see." 
</P>
<P>

The editor of Blythe's twice-weekly newspaper said the state attorney general 
has told him that refusal by the town's only movie theater to admit the paper's 
part-time movie critic may violate California's civil rights law. But, said 
Harold Stanford, editor of the Palo Verde Valley Times, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp has advised him to seek an amicable settlement. Stanford, who has been 
sending critic Cathy Monnett more than 60 miles to Yuma to review films, said 
Van de Kamp has not responded to his request that the state file suit against 
the theater. Monnett was banned from the theater Dec. 14.

The family of brain-damaged singer-composer Barry Sadler has agreed to let a 
Nashville, Tenn., judge name an independent guardian for him, Cuyahoga County 
Probate Judge John J. Donnelly said in Cleveland. Sadler's mother, Bebe, and 
son, Thor, had each asked to be named guardian for Sadler, who is hospitalized 
in a Cleveland suburb. Sadler, best known for his "Ballad of the Green Berets," 
suffered brain damage when he was shot last fall.

A federal judge encountered immediate problems as he began selecting jurors for 
the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North. About 40 of the first 55 
prospective jurors were tentatively dismissed after saying that they had 
watched North's 1987 congressional testimony on television or had read about 
it. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell noted that the government's case 
against North must be based solely on evidence gathered independently of his 
congressional testimony. By the end of the day Gesell had screened only seven 
prospective jurors who said that they had paid little or no attention to 
North's earlier testimony. North, who has pleaded innocent to 12 criminal 
charges, sat at the defense table smiling at supporters.

NEWSMAKERS: REAGAN BOOKS: IT'S MEESE'S TURN

Former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III could write a book about his long association 
with Ronald Reagan. In fact, he has signed a contract with Henry Holt &amp; Co. 
Inc. to do just that, the publishing company announced. The amount of Meese's 
advance was not disclosed. Lottchen Shivers, publicity director for Henry Holt, 
said only that the figure was less than the $5 million that former President 
Reagan reportedly will receive from Simon &amp; Schuster for his own memoirs 
and a book of speeches. The publishing firm said the Meese book, as yet 
untitled, would be published in November. The Henry Holt announcement in New 
York said the book would draw upon Meese's 22-year relationship with Reagan, 
which began at the start of Reagan's political career in California in the 
1960s, but would focus on his presidency. In a statement released through Henry 
Holt, Meese said that much had been written about the Reagan Administration. " 
. . . I feel a responsibility to tell everything I know about the operations of 
the eight-year Administration," he said. Meese, who was named attorney general 
after serving as one of Reagan's top White House aides, resigned last summer in 
the wake of a criminal probe by an independent counsel, which ended in a 
decision not to prosecute. Meese said he had been vindicated, but a recent 
report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility said 
Meese violated ethical standards in his actions on behalf of attorney E. Robert 
Wallach.

 -- It was a close race, but the late Leonid I. Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule is 
now officially dubbed "the period of stagnation," beat out Josef Stalin as the 
most unpopular post-war Soviet leader, according to an opinion poll released by 
the Tass news agency. The December poll conducted by the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences and the U.S.-based firm Market Opinion Research involved 1,000 Moscow 
residents, Tass said. Ten percent said they had a favorable attitude toward 
Stalin, who was responsible for purges that killed millions. Brezhnev received 
a favorable rating from only 7% of those polled. Stalin polled a negative 
rating from 65% and Brezhnev 64%. The remainder had no opinion. The survey also 
showed that Nikita S. Khrushchev was enjoying a revival. Only 12% of those 
polled said they had a negative attitude toward Khrushchev's tenure, which 
ended in 1964. A total of 51% said they had a positive feeling toward him. The 
current Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was not included in the poll.

A Greenpeace ship and a Japanese whaling vessel collided off Antarctica in the 
most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago 
to stop the whale hunt. The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru No. 3 sustained minor 
damage to its handrails, but the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged and 
there were no injuries, Greenpeace spokesman Peter Wilkinson said via radio 
telephone from the Gondwana to Sydney, Australia. In Sydney, the Greenpeace 
coordinator for Antarctica, Lyn Goldsworthy, said the Japanese ship had 
attached a grappling hook to the 1,435-ton Gondwana to pull it out of the way 
shortly before the collision.

About 80 prisoners on a weeklong hunger strike were badly beaten by guards at 
Cuba's biggest jail last week, human rights activists said in Havana. The 
incident at the Combinado del Este jail, on the eastern outskirts of Havana, 
pitted guards armed with truncheons and steel bars against inmates jailed for 
attempting to leave the country illegally, according to a letter distributed by 
the activists to foreign reporters. The inmates were seeking 
prisoner-of-conscience status and the right to receive mail and to have regular 
family visits, among other demands, the letter said. Government officials were 
not available for comment, but they routinely refuse to answer queries on such 
matters.

A state-owned West German steel firm said it has evidence that blueprints 
supplied by its subsidiary for a chemical factory in Hong Kong may have been 
sent to Libya to help build a reported poison gas plant there. The company, 
Salzgitter AG, and the Finance Ministry in Bonn said in separate statements 
that a probe of the Salzgitter subsidiary uncovered a reference to Rabta, 
Libya, in a 1985 letter from Imhausen-Chemie. Imhausen is already under 
criminal investigation for its allegedly pivotal role in constructing the plant 
near Tripoli. "Salzgitter Industriebau, subcontracted by Imhausen-Chemie . . . 
was obviously deceived" about the location of the planned plant, Salzgitter 
said.

HONDURAS GETS 12 U.S. JETS

The United States has delivered the last of 12 supersonic jet fighters to 
Honduras -- a move that Nicaragua views as threatening the military balance in 
Central America, military sources said. Honduras says the F-5 jets, costing a 
total of $75 million, will maintain its traditional air supremacy in the region 
and replace a fleet of aging, French-built Mirage fighters. However, Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega has said his country would be justified in obtaining 
Soviet MIG-21 fighters to counteract the F-5s. Meanwhile, about 600 U.S. troops 
from Ft. Bragg, N.C., have begun a four-week exercise with Honduran troops near 
the Honduran town of La Paz.

House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), in an attempt to show that avoiding a vote 
on a 50% pay raise for members of Congress is a "collective decision," said he 
is conducting a secret survey of House members to ask their views on the 
controversy. He also promised to schedule a vote if a majority of House members 
demand to go on record for or against the proposed pay increases -- from 
$89,500 to $135,000 a year. But Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), the Democratic 
Whip, predicted that there would be no vote despite widespread public 
criticism. Wright and other Democratic and Republican leaders earlier had 
decided to let the raise -- for members of Congress, federal judges and top 
officials of the executive branch -- go into effect without a vote. In a vote 
likely to come this week, the Senate is expected to reject the raise, which 
must be turned down by both houses of Congress or it will take effect 
automatically.

The State Department condemned free-lance missions into Laos, saying such 
forays "are counterproductive to efforts to fully account for Americans missing 
in action." State Department spokesman Charles Redman's statement was a 
response to a protest by the Laotian government about an incursion from 
Thailand in early January, apparently involving one or two Americans. U.S. 
officials could not identify the Americans and said they did not know if they 
had been arrested. Two Americans were held by Laos last fall after crossing the 
border and spreading notices of a reward for delivery of American prisoners 
from the Vietnam War.

A proposal to allow gay and lesbian couples to live in married-student housing 
is being considered by UC Berkeley lawyers and administrators before being 
submitted to Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman, according to a campus housing 
official. Proponents of the proposal claim that UC policy against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation makes the rule allowing only legally 
married couples in that housing unfair to homosexual couples.

PROBLEM ELEPHANT BREAKS COLLARBONE OF KEEPER AT ANIMAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rambunctious female Asian elephant with a history of outbursts attacked an 
animal keeper without provocation Tuesday at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
sending him to the hospital with a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
The elephant, a 26-year-old named Cindy, shoved the keeper with her trunk and 
head. The trainer ended up at the bottom of an 8-foot-deep concrete moat before 
other keepers came to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The keeper was identified as 21-year-old David SaoMarcos of San Diego, who had 
worked at the park for a year and was assigned to the Asian and African 
elephant yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Attack 3 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
SaoMarcos was taken by San Diego paramedics to Palomar Medical Center in 
Escondido, where he was listed in fair condition with a fractured clavicle, 
bruises, cuts and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's incident was the second in which the 8,000-pound Cindy caused injury 
to a Wild Animal Park employee, park spokeswoman Martha Baker said. Three years 
ago, Cindy lashed out at another keeper with her trunk, knocking him to the 
ground and also breaking his collarbone. Cindy has also tussled with other 
keepers at the park during her six years there, but without serious injuries, 
Baker said. SaoMarcos, who does not work directly with Cindy, was cleaning the 
Asian elephant yard Tuesday morning and was pushing a wheelbarrow of manure 
when Cindy "rapidly approached him from across the yard and struck him with her 
trunk and head," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"SaoMarcos tried to get away by going through a gate, but Cindy followed and 
continued to hit and kick him" with her front feet, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, the details get sketchy. SaoMarcos ended up at the bottom of the moat. 
He's not sure if he slipped, jumped or she pushed him," Baker said. "Within two 
minutes, other keepers came to his aid. He was climbing out of the moat, but 
was in great pain." 
</P>
<P>
The elephant was not disciplined after Tuesday's incident, Baker said, because 
about two minutes had passed between the attack and the time other keepers 
arrived, "and she wouldn't have associated any punishment with what she did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to Compare 
</P>
<P>
Baker said she was reluctant to compare Cindy to Dunda, an 18-year-old African 
elephant at the park that became the focus of investigations into the handling 
and discipline of elephants at the facility, renowned for its success in 
breeding endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Dunda was chained by all four legs, pulled to the ground and beaten on the 
forehead with ax handles and the wooden end of elephant hooks over two days 
last year as discipline for striking out at keepers, park officials said. Baker 
said Dunda was disciplined immediately after she lashed out at trainers. The 
San Diego city attorney's office declined to prosecute trainers for the 
incident, which generated intense debate about proper discipline of the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy is on a breeding loan to the Wild Animal Park from Point Defiance Zoo in 
Tacoma, Wash., where she was known as a rogue, having injured trainers there -- 
one so badly that he too had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy was a 2-year-old refugee from a traveling zoo and was the only elephant 
at the Point Defiance Zoo during her 18 years there, said Lily Moore, the zoo's 
assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said Cindy was maladjusted because of her years in isolation from other 
elephants, and said keepers hoped she would not only breed but experience the 
normal hierarchal nature of elephants at the Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
But the park's elephant keepers said Cindy never acclimated to her new 
surroundings and failed to socialize with the other animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bull Doesn't Like Her 
</P>
<P>
The park's breeding bull "does not like her," Baker said. Even before Tuesday's 
attack, the park was planning to transfer her to yet another zoo, thereby 
freeing her stall for a more willing breeding partner. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy's unruly behavior was well known among the trainers and keepers who work 
with the park's elephants, Baker said. "The keepers are very wary around her 
and take extra precautions. Only two keepers will work closely with her. The 
other keepers stay away." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy is not used for rides at the park, nor does she have a role in the park's 
elephant shows, although her trainers have had some success in teaching her to 
lie down and to raise her right foot in a sort of salute. 
</P>
<P>
Baker described Cindy's behavior Tuesday as "totally unexplainable, 
unpredictable and out of the blue." The elephant was not removed from the herd 
of eight other Asian cows and the single bull Asian elephant. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no point in isolating her," Baker said. "She received nothing for 
her activity because, unless you catch them in the act, they can't associate 
that (punishment) with that misbehavior." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Dunda has not misbehaved since she was disciplined, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Sure What to Do 
</P>
<P>
Point Defiance Zoo officials, meanwhile, are not sure what to do with Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a number of facilities as possible relocations for her," 
Moore said, "including bringing her back to Point Defiance. We haven't decided 
what's best for Cindy, and that's our bottom line: what's best for her 
long-term care." 
</P>
<P>
Asian elephants live into their 60s, and are in their prime breeding years 
between 25 and 40, meaning that Cindy is potentially important for the 
endangered species, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy's problem is a result of her upbringing as an only elephant, keepers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She grew up alone, which isn't a good idea because she's a herd species and 
needed to be subjected to normal hierarchical kinds of things that elephants 
establish in a herd," Moore said. "But Cindy didn't have that, and that was 
part of her behavioral maladjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"A parallel would be for a person to be raised to adulthood and never being 
taught manners, and expecting her to be able to behave by the rules. It's 
certainly not Cindy's fault she's got behavioral problems, and it's not the 
fault of the person who raised her here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Find a Good Home 
</P>
<P>
Officials hoped she would do better at the Wild Animal Park, with its herd of 
Asian elephants and more room to roam. 
</P>
<P>
"But the disappointment for them is that she's still a difficult animal, and 
will be, wherever she is," Moore said. "Since she is our animal, we'd like to 
bring her home or find a suitable home for her, but finding a suitable home is 
more than just name-that-zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Among the zoos negotiating for Cindy is the one in Syracuse, N.Y., which has a 
proven breeding bull. 
</P>
<P>
Don Moore, curator of mammals at the Syracuse Zoo, said Tuesday that he is 
still interested in Cindy despite her attack on the keeper. 
</P>
<P>
"These animals aren't like dogs," he said. "They're bigger than Volkswagens. We 
know their danger potential. They are individuals, but they are handleable. In 
Cindy's case, we're prepared for a certain amount of hands-off management."

SCHOLARSHIP STARTED IN HONOR OF EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scholarship fund to help students from the Juvenile Court School system 
interested in attending college has been established in honor of Don Rucker, 
the deputy superintendent of the San Diego County Office of Education. Rucker 
died Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The Don Rucker Memorial Scholarship Fund will provide assistance to such 
students, who attend schools within the Juvenile Court system after referrals 
from probation or social service departments. Most students in the system have 
limited funds and are unable to attend college even when they are to continue 
their study. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker helped begin the Dollars for Scholars program and a San Diego County 
Court School Scholarship Foundation in 1986, and was a longtime proponent of 
encouraging such students to think of higher education. More than 30 Court 
School students have received a total of $6,000 since the foundation was set 
up.

'CLEANING UP SPORTS SYSTEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with great effort that I control the emotions called forth by a reading 
of a recommendation appearing in your editorial. 
</P>
<P>
You suggest that stipends be given to athletes who meet the NCAA standards 
because they are semiprofessionals and make money for the school. Apparently, 
the fact that college sports have become a highly competitive money-making 
system does not strike you as inappropriate. I cannot fathom the mentality that 
accepts commercialization of school sports as the norm, and sees nothing 
objectionable in it. 
</P>
<P>
The root cause of this scandalous condition is funneling of monies from sports 
television, the NFL and the NBA in exchange for the right to exploit and 
trivialize college sports programs. The Times should give its support to the 
solution offered by Ira Michael Heyman, chancellor of the University of 
California, Berkeley: that the NFL and NBA form their own minor leagues for 
player development, and stop using our schools for this purpose. It is no part 
of higher education's mission to produce athletes for the professional sport 
leagues.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the editorial, the author makes some very valid points about the NCAA 
regulations concerning academic eligibility and financial aid for college 
athletes. One of the points, however, must be strongly condemned -- that of 
totally eliminating freshman eligibility. If the goal of the NCAA is to protect 
the interest of "student-athletes," that is the worst move it could make. 
</P>
<P>
For four years at Caltech, I participated in college sports, water polo, 
baseball, and swimming. I also managed to finish my education in less than four 
full years. I would guess that this is what is meant by student-athlete. During 
my first year at Caltech, one of the only things that kept me going was the 
participation in sports, and the camaraderie the team members shared. We 
learned much earlier than most to schedule our time around sports, and to 
schedule our sporting activities around our studies. For many of us, we did 
better because of our commitment to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Caltech does not have the big-time athletic program that was being 
referred to in the editorial, but it is the kind of program that would most 
drastically be affected by eliminating freshman eligibility. I hope that the 
NCAA does not institute such a misguided idea in the near future.

I read with interest your editorial "Cleaning Up the Sports System" (Jan. 23). 
I believe that your call for a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. review of its 
standards and the manner of enforcing them is absolutely required, not only 
from the standpoint of equity regarding black athletes but, as you rightly 
point out, from the standpoint of equity between athletes and students 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
We re-issued our magazine, New Perspectives, in January. This issue is entirely 
devoted to the NCAA's Proposition 48. My own essay, "Rhode's Handicapping: 
Slowing the Pace of Integration," provides considerable documentary evidence to 
support your expression of concern. I do not call for the elimination of 
freshman eligibility, as you do, thinking it well for each institution (or at 
least conference) to decide that for itself. 
</P>
<P>
But you will find support for your idea that athletic merit ought to be 
rewarded proportionately to the gains it brings the institutions. You apologize 
for this as "a radical proposal." I could not disagree more; I think that you 
show yourselves, on this question, squarely in the mainstream of responsible 
opinion!

CONSERVING ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison has maintained a leadership role in energy 
conservation for more than a decade, and our commitment is no less today. 
Reporter Jill Stewart's article "Utilities Shun Energy Savings, Critics Assert" 
(Part I, Jan. 15) ignores several important facts about Edison's extensive 
conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has the most successful electric utility conservation operation in the 
country, encompassing over 50 programs for customers ranging from low-income to 
agricultural to large industrial users. We have more than 300 employees working 
on conservation and over the years have helped our customers save more than 25 
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 alone we assisted over 75,000 residential customers to conserve their 
in-home energy use, more than in any past year. Our conservation 
accomplishments have been widely recognized, including more than 15 awards for 
excellence in the past two years, and both U.S. and foreign utilities come to 
us for advice. 
</P>
<P>
In just the three years 1985-1987, Edison spent nearly $200 million on energy 
conservation programs that saved our customers 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electricity. This is the equivalent of conserving almost 6 million barrels of 
fuel oil per year. Our efforts have already enabled us to eliminate the need to 
construct two major power plants. 
</P>
<P>
At Edison, we are continually investigating state-of-the-art conservation 
technologies, phasing out less effective programs, and initiating and updating 
others. In this dynamic process, a cardinal tenet is that all programs result 
in using electricity wisely. This does not mean using less electricity is 
always the best option. Electric conservation decisions must be weighed 
alongside considerations of air quality benefits, fossil fuel preservation and 
cost-effectiveness for customers. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, for example, calls for 
increased use of electricity throughout the Los Angeles basin because 
electricity is less polluting than some alternatives. Replacing combustion 
engines with electric motors or installing electric industrial processes on a 
selective basis may increase electric consumption. But at the same time, it 
will improve air quality. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Southern California Edison's energy conservation efforts will be 
pro-active and responsive to customers' needs.

SALVADOR GUERRILLAS' OFFER IS WORTH A TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH E. SHARPE, Kenneth E. Sharpe is a professor of political science at 
Swarthmore College.This commentary is based on an article in the winter issue 
of World Policy Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On paper the Salvadoran guerrillas' peace initiative seems to be exactly what 
the United States has been urging for years: to settle the conflict with 
ballots, not bullets. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front says that 
it will support the presidential election this year, urge votes for its allies 
in the leftist Democratic Convergence and accept the results. In return it 
wants security guarantees, fair electoral procedures and a six-month 
postponement of the election, to September. This would give the Convergence 
time to organize a countrywide campaign if popular and political organizations 
are allowed to operate without repression. 
</P>
<P>
Washington officially welcomed the offer as a positive sign, but it remained 
wary -- and rightly so. The guerrillas have violently disrupted past elections, 
demanding negotiations and a part in a provisional government before any 
further balloting. Now, just when they are showing new strength militarily, 
they seem to be making an about-face. Unpredictable as this new twist is, the 
United States cannot afford to ignore the possible opening. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years U.S. strategy has had two parts: military aid to defeat the 
Marxist guerrillas, and political and economic assistance to promote a reform 
Christian Democratic government and ameliorate the repression and poverty that 
ignited the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have neutralized U.S. efforts. They appear able to sabotage the 
economy indefinitely, mount damaging strikes against government forces and 
prevent the army from imposing a military solution. In fact, the army has been 
on the defensive in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S.-backed Christian Democratic government proved corrupt, 
inefficient and unable to cope with the urgent problems that plague the 
country. The economy is deteriorating. Real wages continue to drop; under- and 
unemployment are more than 50%. Land reform has been severely limited, and the 
intended beneficiaries are being driven under by lack of credit, technical 
assistance and marketing support. The armed forces continue to repress labor 
and peasant leaders. Arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture and 
disappearance go unpunished, and death-squad activity has increased. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread disillusionment with the government has set in. The far-right ARENA 
party, long associated with death squads and the oligarchic Establishment, won 
control of the legislative assembly last March and began to dismantle the 
Christian Democrats' tentative reforms. Now ARENA is favored to win the 
presidency, which would polarize the situation still further, threatening the 
bipartisan support for continued aid in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Although this deteriorating situation makes it rational for the White House to 
take the guerrilla offer seriously, the key actors in El Salvador have little 
interest. Jose Napoleon Duarte and ARENA cite insurmountable constitutional 
problems as preventing postponement of the election, an uncharacteristic 
adherence to legal strictures that belies their real objections. The right is 
confident that it can win next month. Giving the left the time and freedom to 
organize would certainly block ARENA from winning a majority on the first 
ballot, and would threaten its position in a run-off. ARENA is probably 
mistaken in thinking that it can create political and economic stability and 
win the war, but it wants to take office and try. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats know that they are doing badly against ARENA, and a 
six-month postponement of the election would allow a unified left to attract 
many Christian Democratic supporters disillusioned with the party's failure to 
deliver on promises of reform, recovery and peace. There is a reasonable chance 
that by September the Democratic Convergence could beat the Christian Democrats 
on the first round, forcing a run-off with ARENA. 
</P>
<P>
The military's prime interest is in destroying the guerrillas and keeping the 
left out of power. A leftist civilian government that would stop the 
institutionalized corruption and punish human-rights abuses gives many military 
commanders a chill. They were hoping that the March election would provide 
enough legitimacy to keep counterinsurgency aid flowing from Congress. The FMLN 
demand that the assassinations, jailings and repression be ended to facilitate 
a democratic vote would give the non-guerrilla opposition space in which to 
challenge military dominance. 
</P>
<P>
Does the initial rejection of the FMLN offer doom it? Not necessarily. All of 
the actors in the capital know that without the $1 million a day in U.S. aid 
the economy and the war effort would collapse. If Vice President Dan Quayle 
makes clear, when he visits San Salvador this week, that the FMLN's offer is 
worth negotiating, there is a good chance of progress. 
</P>
<P>
There are points in the proposal that need to be clarified and negotiated; it's 
not clear, for example, what the guerrillas mean when they say that they are 
willing to "accept the legitimacy of the electoral result," nor is it clear 
whether they will cease urban terrorism like car bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, the initial State Department response was to call the FMLN proposal 
"worthy of serious and substantive consideration." There is good reason for the 
United States to urge its reluctant allies in El Salvador to test the FMLN's 
intentions. Eight years of U.S. efforts to win the war and create a centrist 
alternative have failed. If the election were postponed, the worst that could 
happen is that the situation would be back to where it is today. But there is 
the possibility that it might be better -- that the FMLN offer might be the 
start of national reconciliation and peace.

Everything used to be so simple. I was young. School was easy; I mastered long 
division and even geometry. I spent hours in front of the TV with friends. I 
negotiated an equitable settlement with my parents whereby I took a shower only 
every other day. 
</P>
<P>
My family had a house in the mountains. It was by the lake. Over the summer I 
would sail my 12-foot Sunfish. And that was simple, too. During those hot days 
my mom made me iced tea in the morning. I walked down to my slip by the lake 
and put up the sail. Sometimes I even attempted this maneuver after I untied 
the small boat from its protective dock; I challenged the lake to rock me as I 
secured the large sheet of orange nylon. Occasionally a gust of wind tipped the 
boat and I found myself swimming in the warm water. After righting the boat, I 
applied a fresh coat of tanning lotion. The sun was always shining. 
</P>
<P>
I learned to call the single rope used to control the sail the "sheet" and the 
large pole that held the sail in place the "boom." There were also "tacks" and 
"jibs" and "coming about." When I called the rudder a "tiller," the respect of 
my fellow sailors grew. 
</P>
<P>
I would spend the whole day out on the water. When it got windy I could achieve 
extra stability by leaning over the side of boat. As I sailed I held the sheet 
in one hand and the tiller in the other. There was a satisfying directness 
about the endeavor; I had complete control of my destiny. With a jerk of the 
wrist I could come about or direct myself toward the island in the middle of 
the lake or head back home for dinner. Instant satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
But I have grown, and times have changed. Several months ago I went sailing in 
a 70-foot yacht in San Francisco Bay. My college dormitory organized the trip. 
It was my first time sailing a big boat. What a difference! We achieved 
unheard-of speeds. The boat was majestic; a friend who sailed with me called it 
"sexy." We were equipped with a kitchen and a bathroom and a stereo in the 
living room. The boat had three sails, and its boom seemed to be made from an 
intact tree trunk. There was no need to lean over the side to create extra 
stability. I was finally sailing a boat built for men. 
</P>
<P>
The day was rainy and cold. The bay was rough. After some prodding the captain 
allowed me to take hold of the large wooden wheel. But I could not sail the 
yacht alone. The captain barked orders to the crew, and they controlled the 
masts. He told me precisely the angle and direction to turn the wheel. I was 
not in control; I did not even understand what was going on. I had to depend on 
others for both guidance and assistance. But the inter-dependence required to 
sail the yacht did not temper the thrill. I returned to the bay within a month. 
</P>
<P>
My experiences with sailing have mirrored my struggles with maturity. When I 
was young I had only modest goals, quickly and easily achieved. I held the 
tiller in one hand and the sheet in the other. Now that I am older I seek 
richer challenges and rewards. My boat has become larger; I cannot do 
everything myself. My life, like my sailing excursions, has become more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Awhile ago my dad called me. "We've decided to sell your sailboat," he said. I 
protested. I tried to reason with him. I begged. But he was right: I did not 
spend summers at home anymore. I rarely used the Sunfish. It was time to put 
aside childish things. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he relented. He did not sell my last 12 feet of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, regardless of the career-oriented projects on my agenda, I will 
sail my little boat. I will make time. I've had a taste of adulthood, and I'm 
not ready to concede to it entirely.

BACK INTO THE THICKET WITH BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
CAPITAL-GAINS BREAK WOULD UNDO FAIRNESS OF TAX REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON J. PEASE, Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) is a member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, and he served on the conference committee for the 1986 tax-reform 
bill. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a presidential candidate, George Bush pushed for restoring the tax break 
that gave a preferential rate to capital gains. He argued that it would 
increase jobs, promote risk-taking and raise revenue. 
</P>
<P>
If such a simple change to the tax code would accomplish all that, why isn't 
everyone jumping onto the bandwagon? What Bush didn't mention was that his idea 
would undo half of the principal deal that made tax reform a reality. We traded 
tax breaks used by the few for lower marginal tax rates for all. Now President 
Bush proposes to reinstitute the capital-gains break, but no one expects him to 
offer a marginal rate increase at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Heading down that path would be a significant break with the Reagan 
Administration. Congress and President Ronald Reagan found common ground by 
coupling changes in the marginal rate structure with the closing of loopholes. 
This process steadily ratcheted down rates and shut down special-interest 
provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. 
</P>
<P>
There are sound tax policy and equity arguments for maintaining the status quo. 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 set marginal rates so low that the rationale for a 
preferential capital-gains rate no longer made sense. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the preference say that we need the lower rate to encourage 
investors to provide venture capital to risky enterprises, but such investment 
is only a tiny slice of the capital-investment pie. Certainly you could risk 
investing $10,000 in a new business that might fail. However, you could also 
put your $10,000 into IBM stock, gold coins or land. Under the old tax law you 
got the same preferential rate on a gain from either type of investment. 
</P>
<P>
When you take a look at the equities, though, you cannot avoid the fact that 
capital-gains realizations are concentrated among highest-income taxpayers. A 
survey of 1986 tax data by the Internal Revenue Service revealed that 77% of 
net long-term capital gains were realized by taxpayers with incomes of more 
than $75,000 (only about 3% of all taxpayers). The survey shows that 57% of net 
long-term capital gains were realized by taxpayers with incomes of more than 
$200,000 (a minuscule 0.3% of all taxpayers). 
</P>
<P>
It is plain that any reduction in the rate for capital gains would directly 
benefit the very wealthiest of taxpayers. Since preference advocates promote 
the differential as a boon to investment rather than to investors, logic and 
common sense dictate that this kind of proposal be linked to an increase in the 
marginal rate for upper-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Tax policy and equity are not the only considerations. Today changes in the 
Internal Revenue Code have to be evaluated for potential effect on the deficit. 
We can't afford to make the deficit worse. 
</P>
<P>
Even expert opinions on this issue are inconclusive. Reputable studies predict 
very different revenue consequences for a restored capital-gains rate. The 
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis of a 15% maximum rate (the 
current maximum rate is 28%) predicted a $41-billion revenue loss over five 
years. On the other hand, Harvard Prof. Lawrence Lindsey estimates a three-year 
gain of $31 billion on the same change to a 15% rate. 
</P>
<P>
Historical evidence is no help, either. The Kennedy rate cut of 1962 generated 
revenue. However, when the 1981 tax bill lowered the capital-gains rate from 
28% to 20%, a Treasury Department study concluded that it had cost the 
government more than $300 million in the first two years alone. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the revenue effect of such a fundamental change in the 
current structure is unknown and unpredictable. With Gramm-Rudman waiting in 
the wings, can we afford to guess wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, no guessing is required. This is one instance when Congress and the 
President should keep their hands off. The preferential rate for capital gains 
was justified under an income-tax system based on high marginal rates and a 
multitude of adjustments, deductions and preferences. As a result of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986, which took the opposite approach, that justification 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
There is no notion more central to tax reform than the idea that individuals 
with similar incomes ought to pay similar amounts of tax. No principle is more 
deeply embedded in our tax structure than that the tax burden be distributed 
based on the ability to pay. Our old tax system paid lip service to those 
concepts but allowed those who could reduce their tax liability to do so and 
required those who could not do so to pay higher rates than necessaryin order 
to compensate. If we re-establish a capital-gains preference, we would be right 
back on the path that led us to the pre-1986 tax mess.

<P>
Ruby Mae Brown remains in jail because she refused Tuesday to turn over her 
assault rifle and other guns to authorities after making death threats against 
officials trying to shut down her animal kennel. 
</P>
<P>
Brown refused to attend her bail review hearing before San Diego Municipal 
Judge E. Mac Amos Jr., and waived her presence, which can be done in a 
misdemeanor case. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Dawn Beebee, told the court that Brown said her weapons are in 
storage somewhere and not in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
Amos said, however, that he wanted her to give up those weapons. He said he 
would release her on her own recognizance only after she turns over the guns 
and only if she agrees to not possess any firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Brown faces trial Feb. 7 on 285 misdemeanor counts of animal abuse, failure to 
keep a clean kennel and other administrative violations stemming from her 
operation of Kelly's Pet Hotel on West Morena Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Brown told television and newspaper reporters last week at a county licensing 
hearing that she would kill if her animal license were taken from her. 
</P>
<P>
"My life isn't worth it," Brown said. "But I won't take mine alone, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Fritz Ortlieb said he wants to shut down her kennel. It was 
raided last week, and many animals were found sick among the feces lying around 
the shelter. Brown has denied that she mistreated any animal. She is being held 
without bail.

The campus at Patrick Henry High School in San Carlos will remain open for 
students to leave during lunch period, although two San Diego Unified School 
District board members said Tuesday that they favor changing district policy 
and closing campuses during lunch at all high schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
At a closed campus no students would be allowed to leave the school grounds 
during lunch periods. 
</P>
<P>
A school committee from Henry studied the matter at the suggestion of many 
parents and board member Jim Roache. The panel recommended Tuesday that the 
school remain an open campus, despite an overwhelming desire on the part of 
teachers and parents for closing. Roache and colleague Shirley Weber questioned 
the conclusions drawn from the data and were joined by several parents who said 
a closed campus would lessen drug and alcohol use during lunch and promote 
school pride. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and business people from Tierrasanta attacked the report, especially 
the contention that costs would increase with closed campuses because more 
security guards would be need. Tierrasanta residents also favor closing Serra 
High School during lunch hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although Supt. Tom Payzant said he will not initiate a change in districtwide 
policy, Tierrasanta residents could ask for a study of Serra High leading to a 
closed campus, or Weber and Roache could propose an overall policy change or a 
school-by-school option.

BURBANK OKS DEVELOPER'S MALL PROPOSAL

<P>
The Burbank City Council on Tuesday voted to negotiate with Alexander Haagen 
Co. for development of a major shopping complex on 41 acres of downtown 
redevelopment property. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted unanimously for the Haagen plan, which calls for an 
enclosed two-level mall with offices, hotels and restaurants. The $160-million 
shopping center would be anchored by the Ikea furniture store, and by Buffums 
and Sears, Roebuck department stores. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will negotiate with Haagen in the next two months to work out 
financial arrangements and to refine the development plan. A final plan will be 
voted on by the council once negotiations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to reject another proposal that included a $981-million 
retail, office and entertainment complex with a three-level mall and a dolphin 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Bud Ovrom said the Haagen project would give the city a solid 
retail base downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The city has tried to develop the downtown property for almost 20 years. The 
site is at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. last year abandoned a proposed $611-million 
retail-entertainment center on the site. Disney officials said their project 
would have been too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen is a major developer of shopping malls in Southern California. The firm 
recently completed the $125-million Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza in southwest 
Los Angeles.

COUNTY PULLS ANIMALS OUT OF PIERCE, CANCELS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials have canceled an animal care agreement with Pierce 
College after learning that students were using the animals to practice 
veterinary procedures, including the insertion of catheters and intravenous 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce P. Richards, assistant director of the county's Department of Animal Care 
and Control, said Tuesday that 14 animals were taken from the Woodland Hills 
campus last week. He said they were removed after shelter officials decided 
that Pierce College had violated an informal agreement from 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying the animals we removed were in pain or traumatized," Richards 
said. "But we never agreed to let the students use them to learn how to insert 
catheters or intravenous tubes, or take X-rays or blood." 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the county's agreement with Pierce, spelled out in a letter from 
the college, did not allow the practice of veterinary procedures. The county 
provided 24 animals annually, all of them dogs or cats from the county's Agoura 
Hills shelter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treatment Explained 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by Phil Des Marteau, director of the college's animal health 
technology program, explained the treatment of animals the college had received 
from the Veterans Administration hospital in West Los Angeles. Richards said 
county officials inferred that cats and dogs from the shelter would be treated 
in a similar manner. 
</P>
<P>
Animals from the VA were treated for any ailments they had, the letter said. 
Students "give them their vaccinations, and blanket them with loving 
attention." In return, the letter said, students "learn how to give injections, 
how to restrain properly, and how to make critical evaluations of the animal's 
health." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that "at no time are the animals experimented on or are 
they used for any research project." 
</P>
<P>
Des Marteau declined to comment Tuesday. Other college officials could not 
explain what authority the college had to practice veterinary procedures on the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Liz White, an instructor in the health technology program, said the animals 
were always anesthetized before undergoing any procedures that could be 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see what the problem is; we've been doing these procedures humanely 
for years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mick Sears, chairman of the college's agriculture and natural resources 
department, said animals at Pierce have "always been well cared for. The 
inference that we are mistreating animals is patently false." 
</P>
<P>
White said removal of the animals could affect the school's ability to train 
veterinary assistants unless another source of dogs and cats is found. The 
two-year animal health technology program, which is accredited by the American 
Veterinary Medical Assn., requires students to work with live animals in the 
school's laboratories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The school has no other regular source for animals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richards said withdrawal of animals in the county's care from the program 
is necessary to "continue to hold the public's trust." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills and Westlake Village, which contract with the Agoura Hills shelter 
for animal care and control services, have specific policies prohibiting 
medical experimentation on animals collected in their jurisdictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not medical experimentation but we have the public's confidence to 
consider, in addition to the fact that they're not doing what's stated in the 
1982 correspondence," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
After living in Pierce College's kennels for three weeks to three months, 
animals are returned to the Agoura Hills shelter, Richards said. Homes are then 
found for many, although some are destroyed if they are not adopted after a 
week or more. 
</P>
<P>
White pointed out that one effect of the Pierce program is to extend the lives 
of animals that otherwise might be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the problems at Pierce came to their attention through a 
newspaper classified ad last month seeking homes for "desperate dogs used in 
research at Pierce College." It said they had "10 days to live." The ad, placed 
by a person that county officials identified as Genora Hall, said that if 
people did not adopt the dogs, they "will be taken to the pound to die." 
</P>
<P>
Richards said that the ad was placed by someone unfamiliar with Pierce's 
program and that it misstates what happens to the animals. Hall could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ad was erroneous, it prompted the county to look into the program 
and uncover the problems, Richards said.

NEW YORK OPPONENT SAYS PHOENIX HOUSE IS 'TOUGH'

<P>
A salesman who helped lead an unsuccessful fight against Phoenix House in his 
New York community warned Lake View Terrace residents Tuesday that it will be 
difficult to stop the firm's Nancy Reagan Center for drug-abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Tramonti said the Phoenix House drug center, which opened in 1981 near 
his house in Shrub Oak, N.Y., has caused few problems. But he said he objected 
to the "pure arrogance" of the company in not checking with the community 
before deciding to start a drug treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
"They are an organizational juggernaut," Tramonti said at a news conference 
called by the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. "They're tough." 
</P>
<P>

210-Bed Center

<P>
Phoenix House has proposed putting the 210-bed center, where the former First 
Lady will have an office, in the vacant Lake View Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Visiting this site, I think we're lucky in Shrub Oak," said Tramonti, who was 
in Los Angeles visiting sick relatives. "At least we have space between us and 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In Shrub Oak, a community of 3,500 people north of New York City, the 
250-student Phoenix Academy is housed in a former Jesuit seminary. The 
buildings are about 500 yards from the nearest houses, while the Lake View 
Medical Center buildings are within about 40 yards of houses. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House representatives could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Mitchell S. Rosenthal, company founder and president, has said hard feelings in 
Shrub Oak and other communities are based on misconceptions about the firm's 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel good about causing worry about people's homes and their 
children," he said after a public hearing in Lake View Terrace in January. "But 
most of the fears and concerns are imaginary." 
</P>
<P>
Complimentary letters from the Yorktown Police Department, which patrols Shrub 
Oak, and town Supervisor Nancy Elliot were submitted to the city of Los Angeles 
with Phoenix House's application for a permit to operate the Lake View Terrace 
center. Elliot said she opposed the center at first but later changed her mind 
after problems did not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis Snow, vice president of the homeowner group, said Tramonti's comments 
confirm that Phoenix House would not be a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"It does show we're not running around like Chicken Little," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loophole in Law 
</P>
<P>
Tramonti helped lead Shrub Oak residents who fought Phoenix House. But when the 
town would not grant Phoenix House a permit to open its center, the company 
found a loophole in state law that allowed the center to open as a branch of 
New York City's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Tramonti offered few facts Tuesday to support his claims that Phoenix House has 
broken promises to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The center has not admitted Shrub Oak drug users despite promises to clean up 
the community's drug problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House representatives have said they were forced to revise plans to 
treat Shrub Oak youths because they could not get the permit from the town. 
Because the Phoenix Academy is licensed as a New York City school, its clients 
must be former or current students of that district, company officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tramonti said supervision at the center has sometimes been lax. He said he has 
seen adolescents wandering on country roads near his house two or three times 
in the eight years since the center opened. He said some of them claimed to be 
Phoenix House clients and appeared to be high on drugs. He said he never 
reported the incidents to authorities.

2 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN DRUG-RELATED SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-age gang members were arrested Tuesday in the drug-related slaying of 
a Studio City man three months ago in a Pacoima alley, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a 16-year-old from Sepulveda and a 17-year-old from Pacoima on 
suspicion of murder in the shooting death of Gary Bolden, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. Bolden, 44, died Oct. 27 in an alley in the 12900 block of Foothill 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after police served search warrants at 7 a.m. Tuesday at 
nine locations in the Pacoima and Sepulveda areas, Ferrand said. Investigators 
believe the locations were used by members of a drug-selling organization 
involved in the slaying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are being held without bail at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Bolden was trying to enter the drug business in the area 
when he was killed and robbed by the two suspects, Ferrand said. The suspects 
are members of a gang competing for drug business in the same area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested was Sam Ferrell, 19, of Pacoima, on suspicion of possession of 
cocaine for sale. He was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail at the Van Nuys 
jail. Police found several weapons, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of 
cocaine in the searches, Ferrand said.

2 DETECTIVES ALMOST HIT BY CAR; DRIVER ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sun Valley man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and grand theft 
Tuesday night after he tried to run over detectives who were gathering 
information for a search warrant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Glendale detectives went to the home of Stephen Urquidez in the 7700 block 
of Shadycove Avenue about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday to "scan out the area" for 
information to obtain a search warrant, Police Sgt. Mike Rock said. He said 
Urquidez, 26, is suspected of stealing an automobile in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives, who were in street clothes, were approaching the house when 
Urquidez, who had just driven up, backed into the street and tried to run over 
them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives fired at Urquidez, who drove away, police said. He was 
apprehended about an hour later in the 2300 block of Cove Way in Silver Lake, 
Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidez was being held without bail in the Glendale Jail.

DEEP IN SLUMP, KINGS BURIED BY FLAMES, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These things happen. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to the Calgary Flames, 8-5, Tuesday night before a sellout crowd 
of 16,005 at the Forum, the Kings have a winless streak of 7 games (0-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
It happens. Even Wayne Gretzky said so. It happened to the Edmonton Oilers last 
year, when they were on their way to the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we went five or six without a win," Gretzky said. "It happens. It's 
part of professional sports." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who had a goal and three assists, was swarmed by reporters and camera 
crews when he finally stepped into the locker room after the game. It was a 
pretty empty place for a while, as the players took long showers and pondered 
the slump. 
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall smiled as reporters approached and fired off a list of 
answers, not needing the questions: "No . . . Not now . . . Everything's fine . 
. . I'm not worried." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his guests, who included Jack Nicholson and Mary Hart, 
stayed until the end. And golfers Craig Stadler, Dave Stockton and Hale Irwin 
were standing by him in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"See?" he said. "We're still OK." 
</P>
<P>
But all the folks who recently joined McNall on his silver-and-black bandwagon 
are coming out to see the Kings win. Almost won't make it over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Kings played a wild, entertaining game. But again they came up 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The game had a magic moment of hope when Gretzky tied the score, 5-5, in the 
third period. He waited at the right corner of the Flames' net to put his touch 
on a pass from Luc Robitaille and sent the puck in behind Flames goalie Mike 
Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
That was with just 7:13 to play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
But before the Kings could score the winning goal or even make it to overtime, 
the Flames struck for three more goals. 
</P>
<P>
Hakan Loob scored the go-ahead goal at 18:05, and Joe Mullen gave himself a hat 
trick just 12 later. And with 28 seconds to play, Joe Nieuwendyk scored on the 
Kings' empty net to complete a hat trick, too. 
</P>
<P>
Those were very polite guests who sat with McNall until the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are on a long, tough stretch that started on the road and has lasted 
through the first two games of this home stand. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't won a game since Jan. 14. The highlight of the stretch was the 4-4 
tie at Washington -- and that was a game that they had won and let get away. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, a seven-game winless streak would be considered normal. Now, 
since the Kings are in danger of slipping out of second place in the Smythe 
Division, it's a slump. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, the Kings fell to 27-21-4, and Calgary strengthened its hold on 
the Smythe Division lead by raising its record to 34-11-8, tied with Montreal 
for the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are now 18 points out of first place and are trying to hold on to 
second place. They want to finish ahead of Edmonton so that they will have the 
home-ice advantage for the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a positive slant on the game, which followed a tough 7-6 loss to the 
Oilers Saturday night, Gretzky offered: "Well, the same as the last game, we 
battled back and battled back. We didn't quit. We spotted two of the best teams 
in the league a lead and then battled back to be in position to win." 
</P>
<P>
With the Kings trailing, 5-3, Bernie Nicholls launched the comeback attempt 
with a turn-and-fire goal at 5:04 of the third period that closed the gap to 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
That was Nicholls' second goal of the night. He had gotten the Kings started 
with the first goal of the game, knocking a bouncing puck out of the air and 
past Vernon at 6:58 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
But it was 3-1, Flames, by the end of the period. Calgary came back to score 4 
on 4 (Nieuwendyk), short-handed (Nieuwendyk again) and on the power play 
(Mullen). 
</P>
<P>
Also in the first period, Bob Kudelski of the Kings received a game misconduct 
on a 5-minute major for high sticking. The victim in the incident was Flame 
center Doug Gilmour, the same player who drew a high-sticking and 
game-misconduct call against King defenseman Steve Duchesne the last time these 
teams met in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour is getting good at that call. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, the Flames went up by three goals, 4-1, when Theoren 
Fleury reached around Ken Baumgartner to score with just over 3 minutes played. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored the next two goals on power plays -- they had four power-play 
goals in the game -- to get back in it. Mike Allison took a pass from Gretzky 
and scored on a 30-foot slapshot right down the middle at 10:54, and Duchesne 
took a pass from Gretzky and slapped it in from the top of the right circle at 
17:58. 
</P>
<P>
But before the period was out, the Flames added a goal that really irritated 
the King fans. Mullen scored at 19:32, putting the Flames up, 5-3, while most 
of his teammates were in the crease with King goalie Mark Fitzpatrick. 
Fitzpatrick said that one Flame was sitting on him when the puck went in. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek, when asked if the team was trying too hard, maybe 
pressing, answered: 
</P>
<P>
"We might have tried to do a little too much. But I can't say we're pressing. 
The frustrating part is that it was right there for the taking, and we didn't 
capitalize on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron Duguay, the only player on the Kings' roster who does not wear a helmet, 
was shaken up just 36 seconds into the game when he was checked hard by Dana 
Murzyn and knocked to the ice. The back of Duguay's head bounced off the ice. 
He was helped off the ice but was not taken to the hospital. He did not return 
to the game, but he was alert and seemed to be OK. . . . Dave Taylor, who is 
still unable to play because of an inflamed knee, was at the game in street 
clothes. Igor Liba also missed the game because of a mildly separated shoulder. 
. . . The sellout was the fourth straight and 14th of the season for the Kings. 
. . . Steve Duchesne now has 17 goals and 56 points, both career highs.

BANK OF AMERICA TO ELIMINATE UP TO 175 POSITIONS STATEWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bank of America said Tuesday that it has begun a new round of job cutbacks in 
its corporate banking department, a move that could eliminate up to 175 
positions statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America spokesman Ron Owens, while declining to specify how many jobs 
will be eliminated, said the cuts will come over the next several months 
through layoffs, attrition and "redeployment." 
</P>
<P>
One Bank of America corporate loan officer in San Diego, who asked not to be 
identified, said redeployment is a term being used to describe the practice of 
offering certain employees jobs the bank knows they will not accept, prompting 
them to quit. That way, the loan officer said, Bank of America can avoid making 
severance payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer Offered 
</P>
<P>
The officer, a four-year veteran of the bank, said he was offered a transfer 
Tuesday to a job at a Bank of America retail branch in a San Diego suburb but 
no severance package if he resigned. Even so, the officer said, he would 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Another San Diego employee, a 13-year veteran of the bank who also requested 
anonymity, said he was summarily laid off Tuesday and given a severance pay 
package. He said the elimination of his job and others was part of the bank's 
effort to get rid of as many high-salaried employees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said the job cuts reflect the bank's efforts to "streamline our 
commercial banking activities" and to cut non-interest expenses, which are high 
compared to those of its counterparts in the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Williams, a bank analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said 
non-interest expenses for the bank's parent company, BankAmerica, were 70.8% of 
revenues in 1988, significantly higher than industry bellwether Wells Fargo's 
64.5% and Security Pacific's 67.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Job cuts are often the easiest way for a bank to reduce expenses, Williams 
said, and Bank of America has cut its work force sharply over the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company's employment at the end of 1988 stood at 53,700, down from 
59,500 at the end of 1987 and from 78,067 at the end of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said BankAmerica has also reduced jobs through the sale of assets, 
including the Charles Schwab discount stock brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica's assets as of Dec. 31 stood at $94.6 billion, up from $92.8 
billion at the end of 1987, but down from $118.5 billion at the end of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"They have further to go, but they are moving in the right direction" in 
reducing expenses, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said it may take several weeks to determine how many jobs are cut in the 
corporate banking department because it may take that long for the employees 
offered transfers to decide whether to accept them. Owens declined to estimate 
the cost savings that the bank is anticipating from the job cuts.

Commodore International Ltd., said its second-quarter profit increased 38% to 
$38.2 million as sales rose 24% to $349 million. Income before an extraordinary 
item for the quarter ended Dec. 31 increased 74% to $38.2 million. The West 
Chester, Pa., computer maker cited a strong performance by its European 
operations, which accounted for slightly more than 70% of its total sales in 
the quarter, and strong sales in all three of its product lines.

Control Data Corp. posted a profit of $1.7 million in 1988 against 1987 profit 
of $19.3 million. The Bloomington, Minn.-based computer maker said poor results 
at its mainframe and supercomputer operations, its mainstay business, and its 
semiconductor subsidiary offset gains in the company's disk-drive subsidiary 
and many of its services operations during 1988. For the fourth quarter, the 
company posed a $12.8-million loss.

ROGER SIMON: REAGAN: THROWING THE BOOK AT HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until a few days ago, my life and Ronald Reagan's life had some shocking 
similarities: 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Illinois and I was born in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in this century; I was born in this century. 
</P>
<P>
He became governor of California; I have been to California. 
</P>
<P>
He became President; I have voted for President. 
</P>
<P>
Eerie, no? 
</P>
<P>
And even though it is childish and wrong, I couldn't help but constantly 
measure my accomplishments against his. (He had his own plane; I had my own 
car.) 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, he really did me in. When I learned that we were both 
working on books, I figured it was yet another case of the weird kismet that 
has connected our lives. 
</P>
<P>
And then I found out how much he is getting for his book: Around $4 million for 
his memoirs, plus another million for a collection of his speeches. 
</P>
<P>
This is somewhat more than I am getting for my book. And my first reaction to 
this news was jealousy. Which was followed by my second reaction: more 
jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
Since I am thoroughly ashamed of my thoughts, I figured I would share them with 
you: 
</P>
<P>
Thought No. 1: Ronald Reagan was the President who couldn't remember things. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure you remember this. During the Iran-Contra scandal, he constantly said 
he couldn't remember what he approved when. Ed Muskie, a member of the Tower 
Commission that investigated the scandal, said of Reagan's testimony to that 
body: "What he didn't remember astonished us." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he couldn't remember when he had approved the first shipment of 
arms to Iran, Reagan replied: "Everyone who can remember what they were doing 
on Aug. 8, 1985, raise your hand. I think it's possible to forget." 
</P>
<P>
But if he forgot all this stuff, how is he going to write a $4 million book 
about it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: He must have taken notes. 
</P>
<P>
Thought No. 2: Ronald Reagan was the President who didn't take notes. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation following the Tower Commission report, Reagan 
said: "One thing still upsetting to me, however, is that no one kept proper 
records of meetings or decisions (of the National Security Council). This led 
to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arms shipment before or after 
the fact." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't take notes. Nobody else took notes. So this part of his book, the 
greatest scandal of his presidency, should be a very short chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Thought No. 3: Ronald Reagan was the President who, according to his aides, 
never knew what was going on in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Book after book by the people who worked for him has said that he was 
"detached" or "out of the loop" or "delegated" away his authority. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to James Cannon, former aide to White House Chief of Staff 
Howard Baker, Reagan was so "detached" that high level White House aides 
considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, "Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984-88," Cannon is 
quoted as saying: "They (aides) told stories about how inattentive and inept 
the President was. He was lazy; he wasn't interested in the job. They said he 
wouldn't read the papers they gave him -- even short position papers and 
documents -- all he wanted to do was to watch movies and television at the 
residence." 
</P>
<P>
Thought No. 4: Ronald Reagan was the President who even had his "ad-libs" 
scripted for him. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to his publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, Reagan has decided "he 
is going to write it (the book) himself." 
</P>
<P>
Thought No. 5: Ronald Reagan is going to make a fortune off this book. 
</P>
<P>
And I am happy for him. Having got all my mean and jealous thoughts off my 
chest, I now feel liberated. So I called my agent, Rafe (Agent to the Stars) 
Sagalyn, to ask the key question: Can anyone sell enough books to earn a $4 
million advance? 
</P>
<P>
"The short answer is yes," Rafe said. "Simon &amp; Schuster also probably got 
world rights and paperback rights for that kind of money, which will help. And 
if I were them, I'd print a special leather-bound, slip-cased edition, maybe 
3,000 to 5,000 of them, and sell those for $200 or so each. That would help. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, however, the First Ladies have outsold their husbands. Rosalynn 
outsold Jimmy and Betty outsold Gerry. Nancy's book will be out this fall. She 
got $3 million for hers." 
</P>
<P>
(But look at it this way: She's been running the country for the last eight 
years. Sorry, that just sneaked in. I am thoroughly ashamed of myself.) 
</P>
<P>
But how many books, I asked Rafe, does it take to earn $4 million? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say about 500,000 copies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, I said, that sounds like a lot of books to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yes and no," Rafe said. "Last year, the 'Eight Week Cholesterol Cure' 
sold a million." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what makes this country so great: Not only can anyone be President; 
anyone can write a best seller.

CHARTING A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS IN THE '60S

Godspeed: Hitchhiking Home by Laurel Lee (Harper &amp; Row: $15.95, 251 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Ann and I try to tell our 12-year-old son, Adam, what it was like in 
the '60s. We talk about our generation's restless but earnest striving for good 
values and good works -- but we are circumspect about the sex and the drugs. 
Now I can safely hand him a copy of Laurel Lee's "Godspeed" -- an antiseptic 
account of the life and times of a searcher after beauty and truth in Berkeley, 
Haight-Ashbury, Venice, Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska during those 
tumultuous years. 
</P>
<P>
Lee reminds us of the silliness, the vanity and the sometimes dangerous 
promiscuity -- moral, spiritual and intellectual -- of the '60s. She is 
generous in opening herself and her foibles to our scrutiny, a gesture that is 
childlike both in its innocence and its self-absorption. And she is successful 
at capturing some of the absurdities of the hippie ethos. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do I need to remind you of our agreement?" asks her companion, a bad poet 
and a rather fainthearted student of enlightenment, as they seek out a forest 
retreat where they will fast and meditate. "Look, Laurel, it's no drugs or 
food, and we stay here until we blast through all these things that our flesh 
is always demanding." 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know that I am dying and all the significant meals of my life 
are now passing before my eyes," replies Lee, who depicts herself as funnier, 
more alert and vastly more articulate than the mythic "hippie chick." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reverence for Language 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, we are continually reminded that Lee is not a hippie chick at all. For 
one thing, she carries a joint in "the natural pocket in my bra between my 
breasts" -- an article of clothing that one did not often find in the Haight in 
1967. More important, she has a reverence for language -- and especially the 
language of spiritual revelation -- that prefigures the work she will do as a 
writer. (She is the author of several well-regarded inspirational books about 
her own struggles against disease and despair: "Walking Through the Fire," 
"Signs of Spring" and "Mourning Into Dancing.") Even as a young woman on the 
road, she is given to bursts of overwrought metaphor and overheated simile that 
reveal her powerful literary ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting a restaurant job is a lot like hitchhiking," she tells Richard Lee, 
the man she will eventually marry, after they embark on a plan to make money 
for a pilgrimmage to Alaska. "I just step into the slow-moving vehicle of a 
cafe and make words like an extended thumb asking for employment." 
</P>
<P>
"Godspeed" is assembled from the diaries that young Lee kept during her 
odyssey. Her prose is ornate, lyrical, sometimes overwritten; her focus is 
firmly fixed on herself, her husband and their spiritual progress. We are 
given, too, an assortment of her rather too whimsical line drawings and a 
scrapbook of grainy black-and-white snapshots that confirm our impression of 
Laurel and Richard as happy wanderers of the hippie era who happen across God. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, we are not terribly surprised when Lee idly picks up a Bible -- her 
customary reading, a book of Zen aphorisms, is fortuitously out of reach -- 
and, after glancing at a few passages from the Sermon on the Mount, she is 
moved to a moment of spiritual revelation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the garment of Christ being pulled over our shoulders," she says of her 
husband and herself at that moment. "I am new, and what we are together can be 
a new configuration of a couple too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'May I Make the Angels Smile' 
</P>
<P>
Her calling does not dampen her sense of whimsy, her rhetorical excesses, or 
her preoccupation with herself: "I'm your daughter, at duty," she prays. "Put a 
dove on my shoulder. May I make the angels smile." Indeed, we hear very little 
more about her beliefs, or the impact of her faith on her lfe, as she and 
Richard persist in wandering up and down the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, all of "Godspeed" is a latter-day pilgrim's progress, although I 
never really understood what Lee and her husband were seeking. Alaska is their 
destination and their cherished goal -- they imagine that they will homestead 
in the frozen wilderness -- but, along the way, the Lees encounter drug dealers 
and "Jesus freaks," Salvation Army missions and hippie encampments, and their 
own illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are both candidates for never-never land," she reflects. "I remember it's 
the second star to the right, and Peter Pan took the boys there who never 
wanted to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
"Godspeed" is, of course, only one tiny fragment of the collective generational 
crisis that we call the '60s -- and a rather odd fragment at that. Lee largely 
neglects the other variations on her theme of self-discovery and 
self-expression in the '60s -- radical politics, for example, are wholly absent 
from "Godspeed," and so is any encounter with the sexual and chemical excesses 
of that era. Even her treatment of self-revelation through faith is somehow 
unsatisfying. To Adam, and to any reader of Lee's book, I would say, yes, 
"Godspeed" is part of the story of what it was like in the '60s, but it is not 
the whole story.

'RAISIN' RETAINS ITS POWER ON 'PLAYHOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you loved the Roundabout Theatre's 25th anniversary production of Lorraine 
Hansberry's "A Raisin in the Sun," you'll love the television clone that is 
showing up tonight on "American Playhouse" (8-11 p.m., Channels 28 and 15). 
</P>
<P>
Like its stage predecessor (which came to the Wilshire Theatre in April, 1987), 
it is a powerful reminder of the loss we all suffered when Hansberry died of 
cancer in 1965 at the age of 34. 
</P>
<P>
"Raisin," Hansberry's first and major work for the stage, was in the truest 
sense a seminal black play. It remains one of the strongest, having exploded on 
Broadway in 1959 with the force of a hurricane -- well before the civil rights 
movement of the '60s was a fact and before there was an identifiable movement 
known as black theater. 
</P>
<P>
It has since been filmed and musicalized ("Raisin"), but never with the same 
force that drives the play, which is still as human, compelling and exceptional 
today as it was 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The "American Playhouse" production, directed by Bill Duke, acknowledges the 
debt it owes to Harold Scott's staging of the Roundabout anniversary 
production. With one exception -- the masterful casting of Danny Glover as 
Walter Lee -- it also employs the same actors in all key roles. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that this television version is every bit as accomplished and 
perhaps more vivid than its theatrical counterpart, thanks to the camera's 
probing eye and its ability to give us this family's turbulence at close range. 
The stage version billed itself (not incorrectly, as it turned out) as 
"definitive." This "American Playhouse" version is entitled to the same 
adjective for the same reason: It earns it. 
</P>
<P>
"Raisin in the Sun" is, for any who have not yet encountered it, the 
emancipation of the Younger family, living in a Chicago walk-up too small to 
adequately contain them, let alone their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Lee (Glover), a chauffeur, doesn't dream; he virtually salivates at the 
idea of becoming his own boss by owning his own liquor store. His pliant wife, 
Ruth (Starletta DuPois), would settle for having enough room so their son 
Travis didn't have to sleep on the couch. Walter Lee's sister, Beneatha (Kim 
Yancey), is the rebel of the piece, with a questioning mind and spirited 
ambitions to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of this motley crew is Lena (Esther Rolle), a devotedly moral woman, 
soon to collect the proceeds of a small insurance policy that threatens to tear 
the family asunder. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Lena does what she thinks is best with the money. This is not 
necessarily Walter Lee's idea of what is best. The disagreement turns the 
household on its ear, bringing up issues of dignity and black pride, 
self-affirmation and, in the profoundest sense, civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Hansberry weaves matters of personal and political conscience into a textured, 
vibrant piece. The characters all grow and change in fascinating and even 
breathtaking ways, especially the super-bright Beneatha, who rejects her 
wealthy "assimilationist" suitor George (a disdainful Joseph C. Phillips) to 
embrace a visiting Nigerian with a sunny disposition (Lou Ferguson) who, among 
other things, arouses her interest in her African roots -- a bold new concept 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Glover's insistent performance as Walter Lee, the intensity of his 
conflicts with his wife and mother (played by Rolle with the serenity and 
wisdom of a struggling Solomon) that is central to the production. He is 
consumed by his dream, devoured by it, a raging bull in the china shop of his 
emotions, who nearly destroys everything he should hold most dear before being 
bullied back to his senses. He does the right thing in the end (just barely), 
in a gesture that manages not to feel too pat. 
</P>
<P>
As the family moves into the next phase of its life, there is relief, but the 
small craft warnings are up. Who said the turbulent '60s began with Rosa Parks' 
refusal to go to the back of the bus? Unbeknown perhaps even to Hansberry, they 
began with Lena Younger's purchase of a small house in a white suburb of 
Chicago -- and her family's formal intention to occupy it. 
</P>
<P>
In the theater, "Raisin in the Sun" was gripping, but a long sit at 3 1/2 
hours. The only criticism of Scott's direction was that it could have been 
swifter. 
</P>
<P>
Director Duke's version for "American Playhouse" revs up the tempo and contains 
the play without sacrificing a single significant moment of it.

Flu has hit the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Orchestra Manager Nancybell Coe 
reports that 10 of the orchestra's 75 instrumentalists scheduled to play a 
Beethoven/Schubert program last week were out with the flu bug. The sick group 
included Principal Concertmaster Sidney Weiss. "Because the program did not 
require a full orchestra, and because only one player was taking the week off 
anyway, we had to hire only two substitutes," says Coe. What will happen when 
the Philharmonic meets today for its first rehearsal of this week, no one is 
predicting. . . . ALEENE MacMINN

Two different groups of Japanese art lovers/investors are bidding on the house 
where Vincent van Gogh was born. They want to transform the building, now a 
real estate agent's office, into a museum dedicated to the Dutch painter. Van 
Gogh, who was born in 1853, spent his childhood in the house in the small 
southwestern village of Zundert in the Netherlands, but is not believed to have 
worked there. One of the groups is bidding for the property with a Belgian 
businessman, who has already bought a house in the southern French village of 
Auvers-sur-Oise where Van Gogh committed suicide in 1890. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: REGGAE'S HEAVYWEIGHTS DON'T 
GO LIGHT ON LYRICS 
</P>

Two of Jamaica's most acclaimed musical exports, Burning Spear and Pato Banton, 
will headline this year's Bob Marley Birthday Celebration. The ninth annual 
tribute to the late, great reggae pioneer will be held Saturday night at the 
California Theatre in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Burning Spear, whose real name is Winston Rodney, is the heir apparent to 
Marley as the social conscience of reggae music. Unlike most contemporary 
reggae artists, who prefer to sing about love, sex and ganja (marijuana), the 
41-year-old Rodney concerns himself primarily with weightier topics. 
</P>
<P>
In most of his songs, he either rails against the evils of oppression -- black 
Jamaica's history of slavery -- or hails the virtues of achieving mystical 
transcendence through the Rastafarian religion. Rodney will appear with the 
nine-piece Burning Band from St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Pato Banton is no lightweight, either. Although the Birmingham, England, native 
first found success on the British charts a few years ago with such infectious 
dance tunes as "Allo Tosh" and "Mash Up the Telly," his music has since become 
increasingly topical. 
</P>
<P>
On "Never Give In," his 1988 U. S. debut, Banton sings about everything from 
apartheid in South Africa ("Sometimes I cry for my people in South 
Africa/Brutalized and persecuted by apartheid law/Living under the rule of a 
mass murderer/Who goes by the name of Mr. Botha") to poverty in Jamaica 
("Because of the government joke system/A lot of families find it hard to make 
a livin'/To be young and unemployed is an everyday thin'/That's why so many 
youths gone ragamuffin'. ") 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill is Don Carlos, a founding member of Black Uhuru. Since going 
solo a few years ago, Carlos has released nearly a dozen albums in Jamaica, 
Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bob Marley Birthday Celebration will also feature an exhibition of Jamaican 
handicrafts and jewelry and a slide show chronicling Marley's career. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest dance craze of the 1960s began in the eighth month of that decade. 
In August, 1960, a young black man from Philadelphia named Ernest Evans -- who 
a year before had quit his job as a chicken plucker in a local poultry shop, 
rechristened himself Chubby Checker (in emulation of the similarly built Fats 
Domino), and signed with Philly's Cameo-Parkway Records, under whose label he 
topped the charts with his version of "The Twist." 
</P>
<P>
The song was written, and originally recorded as a B side, by rhythm and blues 
singer Hank Ballard in 1958. But it was Checker's interpretation that became a 
hit -- one that soon had teen-agers all over the world dancing to "The Twist" 
and countless other rock acts jumping on the bandwagon with their own 
variations of the tune. 
</P>
<P>
There was Danny and the Juniors' "Twistin' U. S. A.," Jimmy Soul's "Twistin' 
Matilda," the Marvelettes' "Twistin' Postman" and Sam Cooke's "Twistin' the 
Night Away." There was the Beatles' "Twist and Shout" and Gary U. S. Bonds' 
"Twist, Twist Senora." There were even three follow-ups by Checker himself: 
"Let's Twist Again" in 1961, "Slow Twistin' " a year later and 1963's "Twist It 
Up." 
</P>
<P>
Checker, who will appear Thursday night at the Bacchanal nightclub in Kearny 
Mesa, subsequently promoted several other, less successful dance crazes in 
songs like "The Hucklebuck" (which went to No. 14 in October, 1960), "Pony 
Time" (No. 3, January, 1961), "Limbo Rock" (No. 2, September, 1962) and "Let's 
Do the Freddie" (No. 40, May, 1965). 
</P>
<P>
But, by the late 1960s, the hits had stopped coming, the toes had stopped 
tapping and Checker found himself relegated to has-been status. For the next 
two decades, he was a mainstay on the oldies circuit, regularly touring the 
country with rock revival shows. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, Checker's remake of "The Twist," with rap group the Fat 
Boys, put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 20 years. Ever 
since, he's once again been a top concert draw, this time attracting a whole 
new generation of fans. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Veteran singing duo the Righteous Brothers, whose mid-1960s hits 
include "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' " and "(You're My) Soul and 
Inspiration," have picked San Diego as the site for their second retro-rock 
diner. Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield have yet to settle on a name, but they've 
already settled on a location: next to the abandoned Loma Theater on Rosecrans 
Street in Point Loma. The combination restaurant-nightclub, modeled after the 
one the pair built a few years back in Orange County, is scheduled to open in 
November. There will be live music five nights a week, including regular 
performances by the Righteous Brothers and other oldies acts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pandoras will appear Saturday night at the Spirit nightclub in Bay Park. 
The all-girl rock group's new album, "Rock Hard," was produced by San Diego 
guitarist Stevie Salas, who spent much of last year on the road with Rod 
Stewart. . . . Local roots-rockers the Beat Farmers have finished recording 
their fourth album, "Poor and Famous," up at Indigo Ranch studios in Malibu and 
are back in town for a brief respite before they head out on tour in late 
March. The LP is due out around the same time on the MCA/Curb Records label.

Enterprise Monday. Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, was at Paramount to do a cameo in "Cheers," and asked to visit the

JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By HERBERT GLASS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospect of dredging up adjectives with which to praise the Juilliard 
String Quartet at the top of its form has become wearying, although "probing, 
lush-toned, technically masterful" could easily be recycled to describe their 
playing of the Beethoven Quartet in B flat, Opus 130, on Sunday afternoon at 
Caltech's Beckman Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
What went awry in their encounter with the Second Quartet of Leos Janacek is a 
good deal easier to describe. 
</P>
<P>
While Janacek's knotty textures were clarified to a quite remarkable degree by 
these brilliant and brainy artists, there were too many slips to make this 
disjunct, ferocious, moonstruck but by no means incoherent thriller achieve its 
full impact on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
First violinist Robert Mann encountered intonational difficulties in the 
opening movement; in the finale, second violinist Joel Smirnoff scrambled his 
strummings on their first appearance whereas they were swamped by Joel 
Krosnick's cello -- which elsewhere proved uncharacteristically faint-toned -- 
the second time around. Leaving only Samuel Rhodes' succulent viola playing 
unscathed amid the Juilliard's losing battle with Janacek. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the excitement of the first movement -- and thereby of the work as a 
whole -- peaked too early. This is, after all, music in which climaxes are as 
common as crescendos in other composers' creations. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with a jaunty, not-quite-elegant traversal of Haydn's 
Quartet in G, Opus 77, No. 1, and the Coleman Concerts audience was sent home 
happy with Beethoven's aforementioned Opus 130, with its brief, jolly second 
ending rather than the massive, nerve-rattling "Grosse Fuge." HERBERT GLASS

BLUE MONDAY AT BILTMORE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday is blues night at the Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar. This time around the 
incumbents were singers Barbara Morrison and Maurice Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, an enthusiastic and personable woman who was once part of the Johnny 
Otis blues family, led off her set with two songs far removed from the blues. 
Steve Allen's "This Could Be The Start of Something Big" is a fine opener for a 
cabaret singer, but it set the wrong mood for Blue Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"A Sunday Kind of Love" was closer to the requisite spirit, but it was not 
until the lady moved into her Aretha Franklin bag that she commanded, and 
received, what she clearly wanted -- respect, as a messenger of a grand 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of her selections were drawn from the song books of other women: 
"Since I Fell for You," a long-ago blues/ballad by Ella Johnson, to which she 
brought the right indigo sensitivity; "Meet Me With Your Black Drawers On," a 
raunchy leaf out of Jeannie Cheatham's book; and the Dinah Washington hit "What 
a Difference a Day Made." 
</P>
<P>
The use of something borrowed for something blue can only take an artist just 
so far. Morrison needs to seek out material with which she can become 
personally identified; certainly her strong, compelling sound is an asset of 
which she should take full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Miller fronted a trio with Dwayne Smith, a somewhat florid pianist who 
now and then dug into the blues with the needed conviction; Laurence Bolden, 
who offered a twangy solo on electric bass; and Dennis Siewell on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Miller moved around the bandstand as if a whole lot were happening. This visual 
proposition was belied by the aural facts, since his vocals -- numbers such as 
B.B. King's "The Thrill Is Gone" -- were somewhat too derivative. His best 
moments came during the finale with a parody of the indecipherable blues lyrics 
of Big Joe Turner. On this he was joined by Morrison as the two of them shook, 
rattled and rolled with true Kansas City abandon. LEONARD FEATHER

RICHARD GOODE PLAYS 4 BEETHOVEN SONATAS AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the active concert repertory dwindles almost from day to day for lack of 
nourishing replenishment, the opportunities for performing specialization 
likewise shrinks apace. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Goode, the American-born and trained pianist who played a Beethoven 
recital in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Monday night, may resent this 
categorization, for he does on occasion indeed play music other than Beethoven. 
But when a pianist records all the Beethoven sonatas, as Goode has done, and 
goes about playing recitals devoted to that composer, he must expect to be 
regarded as a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The Beethoven that Goode offered at his recital did not project an air of 
finality. It did not convince for a moment that this was the last word, or that 
nothing is left to be said on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
It was actually rather understated and repressed Beethoven, that had a good 
deal to do with clean, fluent piano playing, but very little to do with a 
tempestuous composer hurling thunderbolts at heaven and earth. 
</P>
<P>
The four sonatas that Goode selected -- Opus 31, No. 1 in G; Opus 81a in 
E-flat; Opus 101 in A, and Opus 111 in C minor -- were set forth as neatly as 
official blueprints. The designs were clear, the notes and interpretive ideas 
indisputably correct, but the music seldom roused to vivid life. It made 
pleasant listening, it seemed to hold the public attention and it stirred up a 
few bravos. But the style was small, an academic shadow hovered over all and 
passion was a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that may be better than tearing it to tatters. You could honestly say 
that this was civilized, mannerly, polite and unpretentious. But eloquent, it 
was not. ALBERT GOLDBERG

JEAN-PIERRE RAMPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Rampal's program Sunday night at Royce Hall listed a variety of 
Baroque and Classical works for flute accompanied by harpsichord or fortepiano. 
Before the evening was out, the modern keyboard descendant of those instruments 
made an unscheduled appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Assisted at the harpsichord by his longtime associate John Steele Ritter, 
Rampal opened with compositions by Rameau ("Troisieme Concert," in A), J.S. 
Bach (Trio Sonata in E minor), and Cambini (Variations on "Marche de 
Marseillaise"). 
</P>
<P>
Playing from the printed scores throughout the evening, this consummate flutist 
offered an abundance of dulcet sounds and delicate filigree. Suitably 
understated balances and subtle virtuosity distinguished the Rameau and Cambini 
works from a stronger, more substantial approach to Bach. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter moved to the fortepiano for Devienne's Sonata No. 3 in G (1786). Where 
many performances on this instrument leave one disappointed by the relatively 
weak, tinny sound, the use of the fortepiano, in direct contrast to the 
harpsichord, gives the proper context in which to appreciate its revolutionary 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Post-intermission, Rampal greeted the audience with an impromptu, 
tongue-in-cheek speech in which he said he heard "the voice of Mozart" 
(speaking in French) asking him to play his Sonata in D, K. 306, accompanied by 
concert grand piano! 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Wolfgang lobbied via proxy for Pleyel's Sonata in G (1788), since 
both works found Ritter at the modern instrument. In any case, the choice 
proved apt in illustrating the transitional nature of the fortepiano; both 
works benefited from the change. 
</P>
<P>
Here, hints of fatigue were evident in occasional intonation problems and a 
smattering of overblown notes. However, Rampal's full mastery was on display in 
three encores. GREG HETTMANSBERGER

FDA WILL SPEED USE OF KEY AIDS TREATMENT; 
</P>
<P>
EXPERIMENTAL DRUG HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PREVENT MOST COMMON INFECTION THREATENING 
PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S Food and Drug Administration will approve widespread distribution of an 
experimental drug that has been shown to prevent pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia, the most common life-threatening infection seen in AIDS patients, 
agency officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The action, expected to be announced within days, will allow between 50,000 and 
100,000 patients with AIDS or pre-AIDS immune system abnormalities to have 
access to aerosol pentamidine months before the drug receives final FDA 
approval to be marketed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Advance Seen 
</P>
<P>
Leading AIDS physicians hailed the decision as a significant therapeutic 
advance for AIDS patients, which may save money, decrease hospitalizations and 
perhaps tame one of the most feared complications of the disease. Wider 
distribution of aerosol pentamidine "is going to change the face of AIDS," 
predicted one knowledgeable physician. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most experimental drugs, the patients will have to pay for aerosol 
pentamidine. The price is still to be determined and most health insurance 
programs, such as the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, have yet to 
decide whether they will cover it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have something that is fairly imminent," said Don McLearn, an FDA 
spokesman, responding to an inquiry from The Times. McLearn confirmed that the 
plan will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA decision is based on the still unannounced results of a 400-patient 
study in San Francisco. That study has shown that a monthly 300-milligram 
pentamidine treatment -- administered as an aerosol spray -- is highly 
effective both in preventing initial cases and recurrences of the deadly lung 
infection, sources familiar with the results said. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS physicians with knowledge of the decision declined to be quoted by name 
until after it is formally announced. "The most common infection seen in AIDS 
will become a very uncommon infection," one said. "It may make people live 
longer and live better lives because they are not going to be ill with 
recurrent bouts of pneumocystis." 
</P>
<P>
"It is really important," said another leading AIDS physician, who pointed out 
that because aerosol pentamidine appears to have no serious side effects, it 
should be "easy to use" with AZT, the antiviral drug that has already been 
shown to prolong the life of some AIDS patients. About 50,000 patients with 
AIDS or pre-AIDS conditions are estimated to be taking AZT, according to FDA 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under the FDA plan, LyphoMed Inc., of Rosemont, Ill., the drug's manufacturer, 
will be granted a treatment IND (investigational new drug application) for 
aerosol pentamidine, the sources said. Details of the company's distribution 
program are still being formulated. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment IND program allows certain experimental drugs to be made 
available to seriously ill patients before the FDA grants final approval to 
sell the drug commercially. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, companies granted treatment INDs are allowed to recover their 
costs by charging patients, although they may not promote or advertise the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
LyphoMed has marketed pentamidine, in an intravenous dosage form, since 
October, 1984, for the treatment of pneumocystis cases. The cost to pharmacies 
is about $100 a vial, although patients may be charged much more. 
</P>
<P>
The drug company will now be able to make the drug available to two additional 
groups -- AIDS patients who have already had pneumocystis cases as well as 
individuals who have never had pneumocystis but are infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus and have "T-4" white blood cells counts of 200 or below, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol pentamidine already is believed to be used by thousands of AIDS 
patients, either in controlled clinical trials or under the supervision of 
their personal physicians. But, based on the results of the new San Francisco 
study, many have been using less effective doses of the medication and 
potentially less effective delivery systems. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental treatments are given by dissolving pentamidine powder designed 
for intravenous administration in sterile water. The patient then inhales the 
medicine through an inexpensive device that disperses the medication into a 
fine mist. 
</P>
<P>
The new 400-patient study was conducted by Dr. A. Bruce Montgomery, Dr. Gifford 
S. Leoung, other San Francisco General Hospital physicians and a group of 
community physicians in San Francisco who treat AIDS patients. Preliminary 
results were presented at the international AIDS meeting in Stockholm in June. 
</P>
<P>
The study tested three doses of aerosol pentamidine over an 18-month period. It 
found that the most effective dose was the monthly 300-milligram treatment. The 
doses found to be less effective were 150 milligrams every two weeks, which is 
currently the most commonly used dose in the United States, and 30 milligrams 
every two weeks, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
For patients with previous pneumocystis cases, the overall relapse rate at one 
year was about 10%, compared to the predicted relapse rate of 60%. Even 
patients who received the lowest dose of aerosol pentamidine had a relapse rate 
of only 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Similar results were found for patients who had never had pneumocystis, 
although the difference between treatment groups was not as great for these 
patients because fewer of them became sick. 
</P>
<P>
"The results became clear within the last several weeks," one source said. 
"People who came down with pneumocystis tended to have mild cases and the 
mortality rate was very low, about 4%. This suggests some sort of protective 
role for all doses." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and patients are being notified of the results and all the 
patients will be switched to the 300-milligram dose. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sources said the study demonstrated the effectiveness of a 
delivery system known as the "Respigard II nebulizer," which is one of several 
devices that have been used to administer aerosol pentamidine. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has granted treatment IND status to eight drugs, including the AIDS 
drugs trimetrexate and ganciclovir, since the program was started in 1987. In 
addition, AZT, or azidothymidine, was made available to more than 4,000 AIDS 
patients before it received final marketing approval in 1987.

TOWER'S 'MORAL CHARACTER' HIT BY CONSERVATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush 
Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel 
Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition 
-- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married," 
conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
"I encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to 
temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator. But several 
members conceded that, while their former colleague may not be the ideal 
candidate for the Pentagon's top job, he probably will win Senate approval 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee, and a shortage of 
witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge," said committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation, testified that 
Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of 
belt-tightening and management reform. In an extraordinary challenge to Tower's 
nomination, Weyrich also suggested that Tower's moral shortcomings could make 
him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments "to bring pressure on the 
United States government and on him personally. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from 
someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life," Weyrich said. 
"Private morals have public effects." 
</P>
<P>
Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, 
including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 
1984. He has been dogged by reports that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer 
and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary 
austerity that the Pentagon faces. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush 
called the talk "a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless." Saying that 
"Nixon went to China," Bush added that Tower's record of support for Pentagon 
spending hikes could be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
But Weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of Tower's fitness for the job, 
after two days of testimony last week in which Tower won broad praise from 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Contractors 
</P>
<P>
Fulbright Institute scholar William C. Jackson Jr. and William G. Phillips, 
president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense, 
joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination. Phillips echoed 
Jackson's complaint that Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past 
support for big defense budgets raise "serious doubts that John Tower is the 
best man for the job . . . at this time in our history." 
</P>
<P>
A leading committee Democrat acknowledged this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I . . . wondered why the President of the United States chose John Tower for 
this job, given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of 
wrongdoing," said Nebraska Sen. James J. Exon. "But the facts of the matter are 
that he has." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), in clarifying the grounds on which Senate 
committees may assess presidential nominees, told witnesses that "it is not a 
function of the Senate to say that this individual, this nominee, is the best 
man qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich also told the committee that President Bush's transition team "received 
hundreds of letters" opposing Tower's nomination, some of which "contain 
specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of Mr. Tower." 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session of the committee, Weyrich was unable to add to his own 
observations with more than hearsay, according to Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.). 
Weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or 
content of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
But the allegation, reviewed in advance by the committee, prompted Nunn and 
Warner, the panel's ranking minority member, to write White House counsel C. 
Boyden Gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the FBI and 
addressed in the bureau's report to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Wallop, a Tower supporter and a leading Senate conservative, termed it 
"troublesome" that "innuendoes have been made, the insinuations are on the 
table, but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable." 
</P>
<P>
In open testimony, Weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among 
conservative activists that Tower is not committed to the Pentagon's "Star 
Wars" missile defense program. 
</P>
<P>
"He considers SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative) a bargaining chip," 
Weyrich said. "We don't." 
</P>
<P>
The panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week, Nunn 
said, and expects to meet once more today to consider Tower's nomination.

DOUBTS KEY PART OF DEFICIT PLAN, FED CHIEF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, questioning what is expected to 
be a key element of the Bush Administration's deficit-reduction plan, said 
Tuesday that he does not believe interest rates will drop sharply this year. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it is realistic for the Administration to rely on a forecast 
that short-term interest rates will fall at least 2 percentage points from 
current levels while the economy maintains its healthy growth rate, Greenspan 
told the Joint Economic Committee: "Technically . . . it is feasible. Is it 
probable? No, it is not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counting on Lower Rates 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is counting on declining interest rates to slice $9 billion 
from the deficit next year by reducing interest payments on the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dispute on interest rates, Greenspan went out of his way to play 
down reports that he and President Bush disagree significantly on economic 
policy. Last week, after Greenspan said that the Fed would maintain relatively 
high interest rates to help curb inflation, Bush told reporters that he did not 
want the Fed to "move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
"There is far less here than meets the eye," Greenspan contended. Whatever 
differences exist between the Fed and the Administration, he said, "are quite 
minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan's doubts about the economic assumptions underlying the 
Administration's budget blueprint are sure to keep the controversy alive. 
</P>
<P>
White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman has indicated that the Bush 
Administration plans to rely on the Ronald Reagan Administration's economic 
forecast in developing its own budget proposals, primarily because it has no 
time to prepare an alternative before Bush's scheduled Feb. 9 economic policy 
speech to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing Automatic Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit law, Congress and the White House are required 
to reach agreement on a budget plan that would reduce the deficit to $110 
billion for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Failure would result in 
automatic, nearly across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the 
deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no changes in current spending and tax policies, the Reagan 
Administration predicted, the deficit will reach $127 billion next year. It 
called for a variety of measures that it said would reduce the deficit to $92 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
To produce those deficit estimates, Reagan's budget forecasts that the economy 
will grow by 3.2% this year and that 91-day Treasury bills will pay an average 
of 6.3% interest during 1989, sharply lower than the current level of 8.3%. The 
Administration also counted on a drop in long-term interest rates to an average 
of 8.3% from the current rate of about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
However, most analysts do not believe interest rates can fall significantly 
unless the economy's growth slows from its current pace of about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, lower growth depresses tax revenues, and the deficit would probably 
rise more as a consequence of that than it would fall as a result of declining 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of slower economic growth to curtail inflation could provoke a 
confrontation between the Federal Reserve and the Bush Administration later 
this year," David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in 
Chicago, contended. "If economic forecasts are revised to incorporate 
projections of only 2.5% growth with T-bill yields of 8% to 9%, federal deficit 
estimates could easily rise into the $160-billion to $180-billion range." 
</P>
<P>
Because the federal government pays interest on more than $2.6 trillion in 
existing debt, interest rates that exceed projected levels would add 
significantly to federal interest costs, estimated at about $165 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its projection of falling interest rates, the Administration 
forecasts that interest payments will rise to $170.1 billion next year because 
of increases in the amount of outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
If interest rates average just 2 percentage points higher than expected in 
1989, interest payments would jump an additional $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If a rise in interest rates were accompanied by an increased inflation rate, 
that would help with the deficit by generating additional government revenues. 
But Greenspan sought to throw cold water on that possibility as well, repeating 
last week's testimony that the Fed remains determined to reduce inflation from 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Greenspan said, the Fed and the Administration remain in close 
contact on economic policy matters. Greenspan repeated his backing for Bush's 
plan to rely primarily on spending cuts to reduce the deficit and offered 
support for Bush's controversial proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate 
on investment profits. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he had met with Bush in December and that he speaks with 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady "on a continuous basis. . . . I have no 
concern about the issue of communication with President Bush."

ADMINISTRATION SEEKING TO MASK BUDGET DEFICIT, GRAY DAVIS SAYS

<P>
State Controller Gray Davis charged Tuesday that the Deukmejian Administration 
is trying to "walk away" from legally binding contracts in order to mask a 
deficit in the state budget for the fiscal year that ended last June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who contends that the state ended the 1987-88 fiscal year with a deficit 
of between $83 million and $343 million, said in a letter to Finance Director 
Jesse R. Huff that the Administration's moves could leave the state liable for 
a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration so far refuses to acknowledge the deficit. Huff, hoping to 
save $80 million and allow the Administration to officially close the books on 
the 1987-88 fiscal year in the black, in January ordered all state departments 
to break contracts for goods ordered last year that have not yet been received. 
He insists that the Administration is on solid legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
The controller's letter, hand delivered to Huff's office Tuesday, escalates 
what has been a running dispute between Davis, a potential Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate, and Gov. George Deukmejian over what Davis claims is 
the governor's attempt to falsely portray himself as a good fiscal manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Larger Problem' 
</P>
<P>
Davis, during an interview, said, "The Administration is manipulating its 
numbers in a way that diminishes the state's credibility and may invite a 
larger problem in the future. All the governor need say is there is a problem 
and here is my solution. Instead, acting apparently out of misplaced pride, he 
is trying to mislead the public as to the true condition of the state's 
finances." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Press Secretary Kevin Brett said the Administration's cancellation 
of the contracts is "perfectly appropriate" and was "well researched before it 
was taken." 
</P>
<P>
Brett also accused Davis of trying to "beat a dead horse to death" in the 
interests of furthering his gubernatorial ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously cares more about his gubernatorial aspirations then he does about 
the state's AAA bond rating and its excellent fiscal reputation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Huff, Brett said the state is operating in the black. 
</P>
<P>
The budget Deukmejian introduced in January shows the state ending the 1987-88 
fiscal year, during which there was a sharp drop-off in tax revenues believed 
caused by changes in federal tax law, with just $3.6 million in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also anticipates that the state will end the current fiscal year 
with even less of a reserve, $3.2 million. But that could turn into a deficit 
as well if Davis is right, because the financial obligations for the prior year 
will carry forward into the current year. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating the budget picture is an accounting change incorporated in 
Deukmejian's latest budget proposal that saves the state, at least on paper, 
$258 million by shifting special reserve funds forward from one budget year to 
the next. A staff report by the Commission on State Finance said that if the 
accounting change had not been made, the state would have ended 1987-88 with a 
deficit of $97 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cancel Contracts 
</P>
<P>
Huff concedes that the state could end the year with a deficit if he is unable 
to cancel the $80 million in contracts that still remain open from the 1987-88 
fiscal year. The contracts are for major pieces of equipment and other items 
that still have not been delivered. Huff is confident that the money will be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
The finance director's action ordering state departments to cancel the 
contracts came after Deukmejian Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost declared in a 
memo that it had become "apparent that a very substantial amount of funds have 
been encumbered and that the eventual liquidation of these obligations has not 
been accomplished in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, in his letter to Huff, advised the Deukmejian budget chief to withdraw 
his order or, at the very least, "consult with the attorney general's office to 
develop reasonable guidelines as to which contracts may be canceled without the 
state incurring liability." 
</P>
<P>
"To do otherwise may result in substantial costs to the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said the order will not be withdrawn.

U.S. POPULATION: BOOM TO BUST?

The population boom appears headed for a bust in the United States, with Census 
Bureau experts projecting Tuesday that the number of Americans will stop 
growing in 50 years and then begin to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
The prime reason: A decline in births as the post-World War II baby boom 
matures. 
</P>
<P>
The aging of that giant generation means that never again will America have as 
many women in the prime childbearing ages of 18 to 34 as it now does, census 
demographer Gregory Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
"After 1995 the population may grow more slowly than ever before -- more slowly 
than even during the Great Depression of the 1930s," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
His study estimated that the nation's population could rise gradually from the 
current 247 million to a peak of nearly 302 million by the year 2038 and then 
begin to decline. 
</P>
<P>
That is the middle projection of a series of some 30 different possibilities 
included in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest growth estimate would have the population peak at 264.5 million in 
the year 2020 before starting to decline, while the high-growth scenario would 
have the nation at 501 million and still growing in 2080. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, each woman has a lifetime average of about 1.8 births, while it 
takes 2.1 to keep the population stable. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing keeping the number of births up is the sheer enormous number of 
women of childbearing age," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
But those baby boomers are now heading into older age groups that tend to have 
fewer children, while a much smaller group of young women is coming along into 
the childbearing ages. 
</P>
<P>
Already the number of women aged 18 to 34 has begun to decline, the study said.

17 DIE IN CRASH OF JET TANKER

A refueling tanker jet bound for Hawaii crashed in a ball of flame Tuesday as 
it took off from Dyess Air Force Base, killing at least 17 people aboard, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich., where the 
flight originated, said the plane's passengers included spouses of military 
members or retired military members. No children were believed to be on board. 
</P>
<P>
The crew of the KC-135 tanker "never got it off the ground," said Vernon 
Wright, 19, who saw the crash. "The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of 
the smoke." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the plane as it was coming down," said Skeet Jackson of Abilene. 
"Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to the left and crashed, 
and then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go up." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Lt. Col. George Peck at Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha 
said that at least 17 people were killed. He added that there was no evidence 
the crew had radioed for help before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was on a training mission from Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base, 
Hawaii, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Washington said the plane was almost fully loaded with jet fuel, 
carrying 155,000 pounds, including its own fuel and fuel to be transferred to 
some F-16 fighter jets as they crossed the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said the tanker crashed near the south end of the base 
runway, near U.S. 277 and about 6 miles southwest of Abilene. 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance record for the plane, powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney jet 
engines, was not yet available, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second crash at Dyess in less than three months. A B-1B bomber 
crashed there Nov. 8, a B-1B bomber crashed there after its crew of four bailed 
out to safety.

S. KOREA CORRUPTION PROBE RESULTS IN 47 ARRESTS; 8 ARE CHUN RELATIVES

<P>
The prosecutor's office announced Tuesday that it has concluded an 
investigation of corruption under Chun Doo Hwan, the former president of South 
Korea, after arresting 47 people, including eight of Chun's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were brought against Chun, and the prosecutor's office said it will 
not delve into allegations of fund-raising irregularities involving Chun or his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
The political opposition, which is conducting a separate fact-finding inquiry 
in the National Assembly, quickly attacked the integrity of the criminal 
investigation and renewed calls for the appointment of a nonpartisan special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies 'Outside Influence' 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutors could not even touch the essential issue in (Chun regime) 
corruption because of its ties to the current administration," said Kang In 
Sop, vice president of the Reunification Democratic Party. "It's our impression 
that those who are close to (President) Roh Tae Woo have been exempted from 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Park Chong Chul, a senior prosecutor heading a special investigative team 
responsible for the investigation, denied that there had been any "outside 
influence" on the prosecutor's office, which technically is under the direct 
control of the president. 
</P>
<P>
"The probe may not have covered all suspicions -- that was partly due to the 
limit to investigation of political funds," Park told reporters. "But we 
believe we have done our best." 
</P>
<P>
Park said his special investigative team of 135 people was being disbanded 
after arresting 47 suspects and indicting 29 others without detention in 
connection with 19 cases of bribery, embezzlement and coercive fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation will continue, however, on two unresolved cases -- 
allegations that Lee Keun Ahn, a police captain who has gone into hiding, 
tortured political suspects including prominent dissident Kim Keun Tae, and 
allegations of embezzlement against Yoon Sok Min, former president of Korea 
Shipping Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on Chun's relatives and cronies began shortly after Roh's 
inauguration nearly a year ago with the arrest of Chun Kyung Hwan, 46, younger 
brother of the authoritarian and unpopular former president. The inquiry 
culminated last Friday with the arrest of Chang Se Dong, formerly head of 
Chun's presidential security command and later his intelligence chief. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Chun's case has been the only one to go to trial so far. He was 
convicted of embezzlement as head of the Saemaul Movement, an official rural 
development agency, and sentenced to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Chun's older brother, Chun Ki Hwan, 59, was arrested in connection with graft 
related to the operation of Seoul's central fish market; two cousins, a 
brother-in-law and a nephew were among others in the clan charged with various 
financial wrongdoings. 
</P>
<P>
Two former Cabinet ministers and a ruling party National Assembly member were 
also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donations for Institute 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Chang, once one of the most powerful men in South Korea, 
centered on allegations that he and others extorted "donations" from private 
businesses to support the Ilhae Institute, a private foundation that Chun 
reputedly had intended to use as a power base after stepping down last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
After public furor mounted over disclosures of corruption and abuse of power 
during his rule of nearly eight years, Chun was forced to make an emotional 
apology to the nation last November and retire in disgrace to rural exile at a 
Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
President Roh subsequently appealed for forgiveness of Chun, once his political 
mentor and classmate in the Korean Military Academy. Public opinion has since 
been divided as to whether Chun should be pardoned or prosecuted. A majority of 
South Koreans believe that Chun should at least be forced to testify about his 
alleged misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
It was far from clear whether the controversy will wind down after Tuesday's 
announcement by the prosecutor's office, which came while all three major 
opposition leaders were traveling outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Probe of 5 
</P>
<P>
The three leaders -- Kim Dae Jung, Kim Young Sam and Kim Jong Pil -- agreed 
last week that they would not be satisfied with the results of the criminal 
investigation unless allegations against five other key figures linked to Chun 
were also fully explored. Among the five are Chung Ho Yong, commander of a 
division of paratroopers involved in the brutal suppression of the 1980 Kwangju 
uprising; Lee Hee Sung, former martial-law commander under Chun, and Ahn Mu 
Hyok, a former intelligence chief. 
</P>
<P>
Roh's ruling Democratic Justice Party has rejected the opposition demand for 
the appointment of a special prosecutor under supervision of the National 
Assembly, saying such an arrangement would violate the constitutional 
separation of the three branches of government.

RABIN CONTINUES TO SEEK OPENING FOR TALKS WITH ARABS

Washington should press the Palestine Liberation Organization to desist from 
threatening Palestinians who take a line independent of the PLO in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip so that Israel can find local partners for peace talks, 
Israeli Defense Minster Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin has embarked on a solo effort to get talks going with local Palestinians 
while excluding the PLO. Although the local Arabs might include some with links 
to the organization, Rabin believes that they will be more willing to 
compromise because they are influenced by home-grown concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In his comments, Rabin scorned the PLO's members as people living in comfort 
abroad, a clear effort to distinguish them from local Arabs living under 
Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is the responsibility of the United States in its dialogue with 
the PLO, (in) Tunisia and hotels all over the world, to stress that the 
interpretation of the United States of terror is intimidation and threats to 
those who reside in the territories," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza "do not do what they think (is right), 
because, as Mr. Arafat threatened somebody in the territories, if you call for 
any stop in the uprising, he will fire bullets into (your) body," Rabin 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arafat Threat 
</P>
<P>
Rabin was referring to a threat by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat against 
Palestinians proposing a truce in the intifada, as the Palestinian uprising in 
the occupied territories is known in Arabic. The threat was widely taken to be 
aimed at Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, a Christian Arab, who made such a 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin has opened exploratory talks with local Arab leaders, including some with 
clear PLO links, in hopes of easing pressure on Israel to negotiate with the 
PLO abroad, the defense minister and other top Israeli officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is under intense international pressure to open some sort of dialogue 
with the PLO. Israel's main ally, the United States, has begun exploratory 
talks with the organization, while European nations friendly with Israel have 
received Arafat in their capitals to encourage negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure comes at a time when Israel's handling of the Arab uprising, now 
in its 14th month, is under heavy criticism at home and abroad. The uprising 
shows no sign of being brought to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Israel should pursue links with "all elements of the population in the 
territories as a positive process toward shifting the focus of interest away 
from the PLO outside," Rabin told Israeli reporters recently. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for Israel to declare to whom it is willing to talk and what 
it is willing to talk about. We cannot restrict ourselves to a policy of merely 
confronting violence in the territories with force," Rabin has also declared. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin recently sent a representative to speak with Faisal Husseini, a top PLO 
operative in the West Bank, before Husseini was released from prison Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The representative, Shmuel Goren, the coordinator of Israeli policy on the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, forwarded ideas from Rabin on ways to end the Arab 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, in comments made upon arriving at his Jerusalem home, refused to 
offer himself as a substitute for the PLO leadership. Israel should "go 
immediately and start talking to the PLO," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Husseini was inclined, setting himself up in place of the PLO could be 
dangerous; the PLO has long opposed, sometimes with bullets, any parallel Arab 
leadership in the West Bank or Gaza. The organization favors the convening of 
an international peace conference in which it would be a full negotiating 
partner. The PLO, whose leadership is based in Tunisia, wants to establish a 
Palestinian state alongside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli political observers were skeptical of the chances that Husseini could 
be a vehicle for talks free of the PLO. They saw in Rabin's proposals a 
variation on a previous policy -- the search for local leaders who might accede 
to Israel's quest to keep large parts, if not all, of the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin's ideas center on letting Arabs choose their own negotiators through 
elections in the West Bank and Gaza. The PLO is demanding Israeli withdrawal 
from the territories before elections are held, preferably under U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The opening to Husseini, as embryonic as it was, created a storm of debate in 
Israel. The government, which is an uneasy coalition of members of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rightist Likud Party and more dovish members of the 
center-left Labor Party, split sharply on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing politicians charged that contact means eventual acceptance by Israel 
of a Palestinian state proposed by the PLO. Members of the Labor Party, 
including Rabin, say it is time to talk with someone, lest Israel risk 
continuation of an unfavorable conflict with restive Arabs in the West Bank and 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
At the earliest, Israel is not expected to come up with a formal peace proposal 
until sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has reacted to Rabin's initiative ambiguously in public. He has, 
however, stopped short of condemning the move, which his spokesman, Avi Pazner, 
says is tantamount to approval. 
</P>
<P>
Pazner emphatically denied that the move represented a step toward direct 
contact with the PLO. Shamir has vowed never to talk with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no," Pazner said. "This is not contact with the PLO. 
We are looking for a Palestinian to whom we can talk, a valid interlocutor who 
is here and not abroad." 
</P>
<P>
In confronting the obvious paradox in talking to someone who belongs to the PLO 
in order to avoid talking to the PLO, Pazner resorted to hair-splitting. "We 
think he is not a formal member," he said. "In any case, it is what we talk 
about that counts."

ISRAEL'S EBAN URGES TALKS WITH ARABS

<TEXT>
<P>
Abba Eban, the former Israeli foreign minister, urged Tuesday that Israeli 
officials meet with Palestinian leaders in an effort to end the Palestinian 
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Eban spoke at a private conference here, set up by the Netherlands-based Middle 
East Dialogues organization, on the Israeli-Palestinian problem. He did not 
refer to the Palestine Liberation Organization by name, but several PLO 
officials were present. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, which recently began a dialogue with PLO officials, 
should have made the contact sooner. He criticized the "curious mystique of 
avoiding contact" with antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, Eban said, had "weakened its influence and position" in the Middle 
East by "refusing to explore the Palestinian reality." But now, he said, 
Washington has "happily abandoned that policy," and he added, "Better late than 
never." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Eban shrugged off the possibility that he could be charged with 
breaking an Israeli law that forbids Israeli officials to contact members of 
the PLO because it is considered a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
Eban was foreign minister in a number of Labor Party governments. In recent 
years he has been something of a prophet without honor in Israel, cast into the 
political wilderness and denied the seat he held for years in the Knesset, or 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the conference were Ran Cohen, a colonel in the Israeli army 
reserve and a left-wing member of the Knesset, and Meis Pail, a retired colonel 
and former Knesset member. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Palestinians in attendance were Bassam abu Sharif, a spokesman for 
PLO leader Yasser Arafat; Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO East Jerusalem 
newspaper Al Fajr; Sari Nusseibeh, a professor at Birzeit University in the 
West Bank town of Ramallah, and the PLO's representatives to the Netherlands 
and the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Eban told the conference that the intifada, as the Palestinian uprising is 
called in Arabic, is damaging Israel's international image. He said it 
represents "the kind of situation any rational statesmanship would replace with 
a new regional order."

The Palestinians need a state of their own, he said, one that could "coexist 
side by side" with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Eban said that the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 was "one of the 
momentous events" in Middle East history and shows that "irreconcilable 
conflict" is not inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Sharif, the PLO spokesman, said he hopes that the United States will help 
show Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that there is no way to end the 
intifada except "to sit down and talk." 
</P>
<P>
He said the PLO is prepared to enter negotiations for a peace settlement with 
"no preconditions." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Abu Sharif warned, the uprising in the occupied territories will 
continue, because the Palestinians are "not going to accept slavery." 
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israelis to "lay down their arms to make peace." 
</P>
<P>
A major purpose of the conference is to develop, through an Israeli-Palestinian 
dialogue, ideas on the sort of contribution the Common Market can make to help 
solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian diplomat, Tahsin Basheer, complained that European countries "cared 
more about human rights in Afghanistan" than in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to work hard to reach the goal of peace," Basheer said, "before 
the next war."

FOR GORBACHEVS, $28,000 SALARY GOES A LONG WAY

Mikhail S. Gorbachev is no millionaire, according to a leading Soviet magazine 
editor, but no one should be shocked that his wife, Raisa, can afford 
expensive, fashionable clothes now and then. 
</P>
<P>
As head of state and general secretary of the Communist Party, Gorbachev brings 
home an annual salary of "something around 18,000 rubles" -- or $28,000 at the 
inflated official exchange rate -- Vitaly A. Korotich, editor of Ogonyok, said 
in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most Western leaders earn far more, including President Bush, who makes 
$250,000. But many Soviet citizens, dissatisfied with their own meager 
salaries, often take great delight in sitting around the dinner table and 
making snide remarks about the Kremlin leader's American Express card and Raisa 
Gorbachev's haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask, if Gorbachev doesn't make so much money, where does his wife get 
so many dresses?" Korotich said in an earlier interview with a Moldavian 
newspaper. "But that is not a serious question because Mikhail Sergeyevich is 
not so badly paid -- he gets more than 1,500 rubles a month. Why shouldn't his 
wife buy a new dress?" 
</P>
<P>
Korotich said that members of the ruling Politburo are paid between 1,200 and 
1,500 rubles a month but that the highest salaries in the government go to the 
leading generals and marshals in the Defense Ministry, who earn as much as 
2,000 rubles a month. 
</P>
<P>
Although such information is not generally published in the Soviet press, 
Korotich said it is not regarded as a state secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders get free transport and very often food that is cheaper than 
ordinary," Korotich said. "I stand for a position where our chiefs will receive 
a real salary -- maybe as much as what Bush makes -- but they will pay for 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's book, "Perestroika," published in the United States by Harper and 
Row, reportedly earned him $600,000 in American royalties. Korotich said the 
Soviet leader donated the money to the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev's salary appears low by Western standards, the Soviet leader's 
"more than 1,500 rubles a month" is at least seven times the average Soviet 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
In a society where times are hard, even slight differences in living standards 
spark bonfires of envy. What is more, unlike ordinary Soviet citizens, the 
Gorbachevs do not have to stand in line for goods that are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's perks of office are far more considerable than his straight pay. 
They include an apartment in Moscow, a house in the woods outside the city and 
a vacation place in the Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, despite his own penchant for the occasional tailor-made English 
suit or raffish felt fedora, is decidedly not a member of the Soviet 
millionaires' club. 
</P>
<P>
In an article published last year in the labor newspaper Trud, a leading 
economist said that of the "several thousand" millionaires in the Soviet Union, 
almost all are either artists and writers, who earn foreign royalties, or 
mobsters and black marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
Korotich did not say where he got his information on Gorbachev's finances.

A Miskito Indian who hijacked a Colombian airliner carrying more than 120 
people was arrested with four accomplices Tuesday at San Jose's international 
airport, Costa Rican officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Demanding to be flown to Miami, the hijacker had doused one passenger with 
gasoline and threatened to set fire to the jet shortly after takeoff from a 
Colombian island, the pilot said. However, there were no serious injuries 
reported during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Antonio Alvarez told reporters the hijacker asked to hand 
himself over to Costa Rican authorities after the Boeing 727 landed at San 
Jose's Juan Santamaria Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He identified the hijacker as Albin Anthony Siu Moses, 24, a Nicaraguan Miskito 
Indian who was living in Colombia. The Miskitos have been fighting a guerrilla 
war against Nicaragua's government. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the hijacking was not given. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Jaime Perez told reporters the hijacker jumped up from his seat after the 
plane took off from San Andres Island, bound for Medellin, Colombia, and 
threatened to set fire to the plane. A crew member reportedly subdued him 10 
minutes before the plane landed.

REFUGEES GIVEN 20 DAYS TO SEEK ASYLUM OUTSIDE S. TEXAS 
</P>

<P>
Central American refugees were given a 20-day stay Tuesday to apply for 
political asylum without fear of being trapped in the Rio Grande Valley, and 
the federal judge presiding over the case strongly chastised immigration 
authorities for allowing illegal aliens to live in abject squalor while their 
fates are being determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to view the kind of disgrace and kind of problem created by this 
policy," said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela. "It is not my intent to sit 
back and be a spectator in my community and my country. I am disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Judge Vela said he was inclined to agree with immigration 
authorities on the major issue of Tuesday's hearing -- that the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service does not have to go through a complicated process before 
imposing new regulations on how the asylum process works. If Vela does remove a 
temporary restraining order now in effect, the INS could begin holding 
political asylum applicants in South Texas within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's indication that he would probably side with immigration 
authorities, despite the admonishment, caused government lawyers to declare a 
victory of sorts. But they also said that immigration officials in the new Bush 
Administration would look closely at practices that led to the refugees' suit 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in this dusty border town, one of the major points of entry for 
Central American refugees, was how they would be treated while applying for 
political asylum. Last December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
issued a new set of rules, based on the claim that almost all political asylum 
applications from Central American countries are frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among those new rules was that illegal aliens must wait at their point of 
entry for the asylum applications to be processed. That, in turn, led to a 
buildup of illegal aliens in the Brownsville area. At one point, hundreds of 
aliens were living in open fields and an abandoned motel, many of them with no 
warm clothing and little to eat. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9, Judge Vela issued a temporary restraining order that allowed the 
refugees to leave South Texas and apply for asylum in other parts of the 
country. Since issuing that order, more than 6,000 refugees have filed for 
asylum and left South Texas. According to INS figures, about half of them have 
gone to Miami, while an estimated 10% traveled to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, immigration officials tried to paint a picture of refugees 
as people who would disappear once allowed to leave the Rio Grande Valley, 
while a lawyer for the refugees said the government was largely responsible for 
the number of Central American aliens, particularly Nicaraguans, who were 
crossing into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Hausman, a Justice Department lawyer, said that huge numbers of aliens 
would be lost in the system, and one of his examples cited California 
statistics that of the 1,417 asylum applications in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, only 74 had appeared to pursue their cases. 
</P>
<P>
"They can potentially disappear among the 240 million Americans," said Hausman. 
"They need not pursue asylum." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Policy Hardens 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rubin, a lawyer for the refugees, contended, meanwhile, that the 
hardening of the immigration policy was essentially a change of heart by the 
American government. He contrasted the new INS policy with that in 1987, when 
84% of the Nicaraguans who applied were granted political asylum. He said the 
same figure for 1988 was more than 50%. And now, he said, the policy is to keep 
them out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin also contended there should have been much more public debate on the new 
INS policy before it was put in effect, asserting that refugees, local health 
officials and a local shelter had known nothing of the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the new rules "interfere with the ability to file for asylum and the 
ability to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, these people were forced to sleep out in the rain and cold while they 
attempted to file an application for asylum," he told the judge. "This policy 
is designed to starve people out of the asylum process." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the arguments by both sides, Judge Vela told immigration 
officials that he would not stand for any more of the conditions in Brownsville 
that brought national attention to the refugees held here under the new rules. 
He said that if conditions did not improve, he would immediately grant another 
request for injunctive relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I insist that you take off your adversarial hat," Vela told immigration 
lawyers. He also said he did not agree with the new immigration policy, but 
would probably have to lift the restraining order because the INS seemed to 
have followed the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
William Joyce, an INS lawyer, said after the hearing that he believes there 
will be another surge of new refugees once word is out that only 20 days are 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you might see a lot of Central Americans coming through here in the 
next three weeks," he said.

SACRAMENTO'S RARE FALCON HAS FRIEND IN HIGH PLACES

The rare peregrine falcon that took up residence in the capital last fall has 
been sighted in the company of a second falcon, giving state wildlife officials 
hope that the birds will nest and raise a family on the roof of their building. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence M. Eagan, undersecretary of the state Resources Agency, said Tuesday 
that the two birds were observed "soaring and darting in tandem" outside the 
agency's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a surprise to see two of them, especially in the downtown area," said 
Gordon Snow, an assistant secretary of Resources who watched for half an hour 
Monday as the birds circled outside his 13th-floor office. "Seeing two of them 
tells me perhaps they're going to set up housekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
The falcons' maneuvers in the capital on Monday undoubtedly struck fear into 
the hearts of the local pigeon population. The city birds, much smaller than 
the falcons, could be seen scattering in all directions to avoid being taken on 
the wing. 
</P>
<P>
The peregrine, considered the aristocrat of birds of prey, is known for hunting 
down other birds and plucking them from the air at speeds of more than 200 
m.p.h. In urban areas, falcons have been known to eat an average of a pigeon a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The capital's first falcon, believed to be a female, was sighted last September 
after one state official found the head of a teal duck on the sidewalk near his 
office. A variety of other bones and pigeon parts were later discovered on the 
roof of the Resources building, where the rare bird was roosting. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the Resources Agency is responsible for overseeing the recovery 
of the peregrine falcon, as well as other endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
The peregrine falcon, like other large birds of prey, was nearly wiped out in 
the 1960s by the pesticide DDT. The insecticide, which is passed up through the 
food chain, causes the shell of the peregrine's egg to crack easily, making 
reproduction nearly impossible. In 1970, state biologists could find only two 
breeding pairs of peregrines in California. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 83 pairs are known to nest in the state, including some that have been 
raised in captivity and set free in Los Angeles, where they roost on 
skyscrapers and thrive on a diet of pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
"The peregrines are coming back, I think," Snow said optimistically. "It's not 
nearly as critical as it once was." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the first falcon arrived in the fall, wildlife officials have hoped 
that the bird would find a mate and nest on the roof of the 16-story Resources 
building, one of the tallest in the Capital. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a real kick if they did set up a family up there," Eagan said.

GREENPEACE VESSEL SEEKING TO BLOCK WHALING COLLIDES WITH JAPANESE SHIP

A Greenpeace ship and a Japanese whaling vessel collided Tuesday off Antarctica 
in the most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a 
week ago to stop the whale hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru No. 3 sustained minor damage to its handrails, 
but the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged, Greenpeace spokesman Peter 
Wilkinson said. There were no injuries, he said, speaking by radio telephone 
from the Gondwana. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the Greenpeace coordinator for Antarctica, Lyn Goldsworthy, said the 
Japanese ship had attached a grappling hook to the 1,435-ton Gondwana, which 
has a crew of 19, to pull it out of the way, and that "in the maneuvering that 
resulted, the Japanese boat collided with the Gondwana." 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a whaling official said Tuesday that attempts by the environmental 
group to block the whale hunt are endangering the lives of crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrorism, the same as that opposed by the United States and other 
countries," said Takehiro Takayama of the Tokyo-based Japan Whaling Assn. "They 
have no concern about human life." 
</P>
<P>
Japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific 
research to determine the size of whale stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace contends that the research is an attempt to circumvent a moratorium 
on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission and that 
most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson estimated that Japanese harpooners have already taken between 50 and 
55 Minke whales this season, about 10 of them since the Gondwana caught up with 
the whaling fleet a week ago.

CHARGERS TALK WITH ROLAND, NOW MAY WAIT 
</P>

<P>
The Chargers continued their search for a head coach Tuesday by interviewing 
Chicago Bears running backs coach Johnny Roland but they probably won't make a 
decision until next Tuesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Roland met in the morning and afternoon with Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' 
director of football operations. Roland also was supposed to meet with team 
owner Alex Spanos. But a bout with the flu forced Spanos to leave the Chargers' 
stadium offices at mid-day and return home to Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Roland described his meetings with Ortmayer as a "feeling out" process. But he 
made it clear he hoped the Chargers' interest in him isn't just because he is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"I explained to them I don't want this to be a charade," he said. "If their 
interest is genuine, I want full consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Does Roland think the Chargers' interest so far is genuine? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a mind-reader," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roland said he has "no problem" with the Chargers' expressed desire to keep 
several of their current assistants in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' short list of candidates to replace Al Saunders now appears to 
include Roland, Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn, Redskin assistant Dan 
Henning and Mike White, former Illinois and Cal coach. 
</P>
<P>
But final selection is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer will be busy the rest of this week drawing up his 37-man "protected" 
list and then traveling to Indianapolis where he will spend Thursday through 
Sunday evaluating college talent at the annual scouting combine workouts in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-man list is the NFL's response to anticipated anti-trust problems 
stemming from the league's court battle over free agency with the NFL Players 
Assn. The Chargers have 62 players under contract, 25 of whom they will have to 
leave unprotected from Feb. 2 until April 2. Those 25 will be unconditional 
free agents, free to negotiate with other teams. Just as the Chargers will be 
free to negotiate with players left unprotected by other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Chargers would actively bid for unconditional free agents, 
Ortmayer said: "We'll go after need before we go after youth. We can find youth 
24 days later (in the NFL draft.)" 
</P>
<P>
At the combine workouts, Ortmayer will have to focus on players available for 
that draft. He will return to San Diego Sunday night. He and Spanos could 
decide on the new coach Monday and announce the decision at a press conference 
Tuesday. It's not an unlikely scenario. 
</P>
<P>
The candidacy of White continues to gain momentum. One of White's biggest 
supporters is former San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh; Walsh's opinion is said to 
be highly valued by Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, White said he would have no problem accommodating the Chargers' 
desire to retain several of their current assistants in order to keep 
continuity. He also said he would move immediately to retain Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
White's strength is on the offensive side of the ball. If named Charger coach, 
he would call his own plays. Like Walsh, he works especially well with 
quarterbacks.

"If they hire me," he said Tuesday, "I would have to think that (quarterback 
expertise) would be one of the reasons." 
</P>
<P>
But White stopped short of evaluating the Charger quarterback situation, 
saying, "I don't want somebody to misconstrue and say, 'Who does that guy think 
he is? He doesn't even have the job yet.' "

Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dave Levy, the Charger tight ends coach last season, has accepted a position as 
an offensive assistant with the Detroit Lions. Jerry Wampfler, the Charger 
offensive line coach, interviewed in Cleveland Tuesday for an offensive line 
opening there . . . Chicago assistant Johnny Roland will be in Indianapolis 
later this week at the scouting combine workouts. So will Steve Ortmayer. If 
the Chargers, want to continue talks with him about their head coaching job, 
they can do so there.

NFLPA FAILED TO COLLECT ALL ITS DUES, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Football League Players Assn., which owes $1.4 million to a 
variety of banks and creditors, received dues from only about a fourth of its 
members in 1987, the year of the 24-day strike, according to financial 
statements filed with the Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said Tuesday that a majority of the nearly 1,600 players have 
now paid their dues. 
</P>
<P>
According to the union's financial statement for the period from March 1, 1987, 
to Feb. 29, 1988, filed Jan. 23, the organization received $877,441 in dues, 
compared to $3.7 million for the 1986-87 period. 
</P>
<P>
Dues for the earlier period were $2,400 per player compared to $2,000 for 
1987-88. Despite the decrease, only 438 players paid. 
</P>
<P>
But Gene Upshaw, the union's executive director, said Tuesday that the period 
covered was one in which there was no automatic dues checkoff -- by which the 
teams automatically pay dues to the union from the players' paychecks. As a 
result, players had to make direct payments to the union. "We didn't even start 
collecting dues until December," said Upshaw, whose salary of $164,847 during 
the period represents a 4% increase over the previous year. "The period in the 
report ends March 1 and we kept on collecting dues. We have a majority of 
players paying now." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw is the union's highest-paid employee, receiving a total of $182,156 in 
salary and expenses. His assistant, Doug Allen, received $89,136, of which 
$67,350 was salary, and Frank Woschitz, the public relations director, received 
$57,760 in salary and $22,096 in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The financial statement was made a month after two reports that Labor 
Department officials had passed information from their NFLPA audit to the 
Department of Justice for possible action. Neither agency has commented on the 
allegations, and Upshaw and Allen said 2 weeks ago that what was reported as a 
$100,000 loan to Upshaw in the reports was no more than deferred payment. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mention of that payment in the financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Berthelsen, the union's general counsel, is not listed in the statement 
but his salary is part of professional expenses, which total $494,139. 
</P>
<P>
The financial report, due May 29, was filed 8 months late, not atypical for the 
NFLPA, which in the past has filed its reports even later. The report shows 
that the union, which dismissed 17 of its 36 employees during the period, had a 
net loss of $310,000, which Upshaw said is largely on paper because it was 
forced to list future severance pay.

STRUGGLING WATSON IS STILL THE SAME PERSON WHO DOMINATED TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it is more difficult for a professional golfer who was used to winning 
major tournaments to adjust to also-ran status, however impermanent, than 
someone who hasn't won at all. 
</P>
<P>
When Tom Watson walked off the practice putting green Tuesday at the Riviera 
Country Club, there were several reporters waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Watson is a prominent figure on the tour and for many years was 
dominant. He has won 5 British Opens, 2 Masters and a U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
His shootouts with Jack Nicklaus are part of golf lore. 
</P>
<P>
But his name hasn't appeared on the leader board with regularity in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Watson didn't win on the Tour in 1985 or 1986. He won the Nabisco tournament in 
1987 and finished second to Scott Simpson in the U.S. Open that year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year was not a memorable one for Watson, though. He didn't win on the Tour 
and was 39th on the money list, although he did earn $273,216. 
</P>
<P>
And he isn't off to an auspicious start this year. He finished 20 strokes 
behind winner Mark Calcavecchia at Phoenix and didn't make the cut last week in 
the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back at Riviera, preparing for Thursday's start of the Nissan Los 
Angeles Open, which he won in 1980 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Watson was accommodating to reporters Tuesday, as he was when his winning and 
high finishes were common. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the tennis players," he said. "They're bad-mouthing the line calls. I 
don't like it any more than you do. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, they're playing for an enormous amount of money, and when 
somebody takes that call away that they think is unfair, they get upset. I 
don't condone it. I condemn it." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said when he started on the Tour in 1971, the players weren't always 
trying to do the best they could. 
</P>
<P>
"There just wasn't enough money to play for," he said. "At that time, they only 
paid through 30 or 40 spots. Even if you made the cut, a lot of times you 
wouldn't make any money. If you shot a 78 on Saturday, what was the point of 
trying to shoot 64 on Sunday? Go out and find a party." 
</P>
<P>
Watson conceded that many good players are coming out of college now and 
improving the quality of the Tour. "The thing that lures them is the money," he 
said. "When you can make $180,000 in a week (the winner's share in the L.A. 
Open), it gets your attention and makes you bear down." 
</P>
<P>
Watson was reminded, not unkindly, that it has been estimated that a pro 
golfer's best years are between ages 30 and 40. Watson will be 40 in September. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he were concerned about that aspect, Watson said: "Sure, I'm 
concerned. I hope there is some powder left in the shell." 
</P>
<P>
Watson has made more than $4 million in his 18 years on the Tour, second only 
to Nicklaus. Yet he says winning is still the main motivation. "I don't buy the 
idea that a person just likes to make a living out here, even though they can," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Watson is more concerned with his putting stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Crenshaw told me two things: 'Hit the ball solid on your putts and keep 
your head down.' That's probably all it is." 
</P>
<P>
Simple, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The pro-am portion of the L.A. Open begins today at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
Among the celebrities in the field are Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, 
comedian Tom Smothers, former National Football League star O. J. Simpson and 
former major league baseball stars Ernie Banks and Steve Garvey.

NEWSWIRE: LETTERS TO JUDGE SAY KIMBALL IS TROUBLED, REMORSEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letters to a judge on behalf of Bruce Kimball portray the 1984 Olympic diver as 
remorseful, devastated and embattled by alcohol problems for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, 25, has had nothing to say publicly in his defense since his speeding 
sports car killed two teen-agers and injured four in Brandon, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained his silence through a lengthy hearing Monday before Hillsborough 
Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe, who sentenced him to 17 years in prison followed 
by 15 years' probation on alcohol-related manslaughter and injury charges. 
</P>
<P>
In his own letter, Kimball told Coe that he has been fighting alcohol problems 
since he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
Coe received an estimated 50 letters, most from friends and family, supporting 
Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
They described how Kimball was traumatized by a 1981 accident in which he was 
the victim of a drunk driver and how he rebounded from the near-fatal crash 
that left his face shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"When he saw the teen-agers on the road that night in August, he was in total 
shock and disbelief," his father, Dick Kimball, wrote. "And I'm sure the pain 
of his accident must have immediately come to mind."

WORLD ALPINE SKI CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN PAM FLETCHER FIGURES AS THREAT IN DOWNHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
VAIL, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's all downhill at the World Alpine Ski Championships for the rest of this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors from every major skiing nation in the world -- and some not so 
major -- made their first official training runs down the high-speed courses at 
Vail and Beaver Creek Tuesday, and as usual, it was difficult to tell which 
racers were going all out and which were just trying to get the feel of the 
best line, or applying the brakes at the bottom to sandbag their times. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pam Fletcher of the U.S. ski team, who obviously likes the course on 
Vail Mountain, showed that she will be a threat in the regular women's downhill 
Sunday when she posted the second fastest time in the afternoon, after being 
eighth in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who turned 26 Monday, won a World Cup downhill here in 1986 and 
finished third in '87. She broke her right leg in a collision with a course 
worker just before the '88 Olympic downhill at Calgary and has been slow in 
regaining her form. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said Tuesday: "I'm skiing the best I can right now. The knee isn't 
perfect, but it's not really bothering me either. I'll just give it all I've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
The men's course at Beaver Creek drew conflicting comments from the Swiss 
skiers who finished 1-2 at Calgary. Peter Mueller, the silver medalist, said 
that the organizers had taken out too many bumps since last March's World Cup 
race and claimed, "It's too easy now." 
</P>
<P>
But Pirmin Zurbriggen, the Olympic gold medalist, disagreed, saying, "It's 
good, I like it. They took the bumps out of the flats, but there are still 
plenty of other jumps." 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen hopes to be able to ski faster than his main rival, Marc Girardelli 
of Luxembourg, in the men's combined downhill Friday and take the combined 
medal, although Girardelli holds a comfortable lead after Monday's combined 
slalom. Girardelli was third in the slalom and Zurbriggen 11th, but the 
difference in their times was only .78 of a second, not an insurmountable 
margin under the complicated scoring system used to determine combined 
placings. 
</P>
<P>
The two will also be among the favorites in the regular men's downhill 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's combined event, which will wind up with the combined downhill 
Thursday, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who has been nearly invincible in 
World Cup technical events so far this winter, will be trying to hold off the 
challenge of America's Tamara McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
They were 1-2 in the combined slalom, separated by just .12 of a second, and 
were relatively close to each other in Tuesday's downhill practice times. 
</P>
<P>
Downhill training will continue today for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
A huge turnout of spectators is expected to make the trip through the 
Eisenhower Tunnel and over Vail Pass from Denver for the two regular downhill 
races this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the schedule calls for the women's slalom Monday, the men's super-G 
Tuesday, the women's super-G next Wednesday and the men's giant slalom next 
Thursday, followed by an open day. The women's giant slalom and the men's 
slalom are set for the final weekend, Feb. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee announced Tuesday that no safety violations were 
involved Monday in the accidental death of the Duke of Cadiz, Alfonso de Borbon 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eagle County Sheriff A.J. Johnson refused to support or refute those 
contentions until he completes his investigation of the accident. Johnson said 
that the investigation would take about one month. 
</P>
<P>
The duke, 52, a first cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain and an official of 
the International Skiing Federation (FIS), was killed when he skied into cables 
supporting the finish banner at the bottom of the men's downhill course at 
Beaver Creek.

WEAVER STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES, WINS BY KNOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cus D'Amato, mentor of Mike Tyson, died before his fighter became heavyweight 
champion. But he left Tyson with some advice: Don't ever fight Mike Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the story Weaver, a former World Boxing Assn. heavyweight 
champion, tells when people ask why he is making a comeback at 37 with the hope 
of eventually facing Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain. If D'Amato had been at the Reseda Country Club Tuesday 
night, he would have had the same advice for Bobby Crabtree. 
</P>
<P>
Crabtree, a 208-pounder from Fort Smith, Ark., was Weaver's opponent in 
Weaver's first appearance in the ring since last April. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brief appearance. Weaver knocked Crabtree out at 2:58 of the third 
round of Tuesday's scheduled 10-round main event. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver first hurt Crabtree (36-16-2, 28 knockouts) with a body blow off the 
left hand, then followed with a flurry that caused Crabtree to crumple to the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Crabtree tried to stumble to his feet, but he fell partly through the ropes. He 
did manage to finally get to his feet, but, by that point, his manager, Beau 
Williford, signaled to referee Rudy Jordan that Crabtree had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
Crabtree has been in the ring with another heavyweight of note, former champion 
George Foreman. Crabtree lasted seven rounds with Foreman in 1987, the longest 
of anyone during Foreman's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"Weaver showed me some punching power tonight," Crabtree said, "but not as much 
as Foreman. Ain't nobody hits like that old man." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, a Diamond Bar resident, plans to continue his comeback with a fight a 
month if possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If Foreman can do it at 41," Weaver said, "I can do it at 37." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, who weighed 218, improved his record to 43-13 with 36 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
The sellout crowd of around 900 saw what was billed as a first -- four brothers 
on the same card. Mike was joined by the Weaver triplets. Middleweight Lloyd 
and junior middleweight Floyd were both winners. The only loser in the family 
Tuesday was super middleweight Troy.

SCOTT OSTLER: THESE CLIPPERS HAVE BEEN MANY YEARS IN THE UNMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all due disrespect to the Miami Heat, it's time we recognized the L.A. 
Clippers as the worst team in professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat features a worse record, but that organization sprang into existence 
just months ago, whereas the Clippers have been around a long time. This is a 
team that has been decades in the unmaking. 
</P>
<P>
It's just as well that the Clippers aren't struggling their way up into the 
middle of the NBA pack, because this is Hollywood, baby, a town that will not 
tolerate mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
Any attacks on the Clippers at this time are unfair, because they recently lost 
their best player and fired one of their best coaches, but who said life was 
fair? 
</P>
<P>
I watched the Clippers crumble on TV Monday night, losing to the Atlanta Hawks. 
The Clippers were out-scored in the second half by 27 points, on their home 
court. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the telecast, play-by-play man Ralph Lawler noted that the 
Clippers "come into this game with a 14-game winning streak, make that losing 
streak." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, a guy can dream. And make that 15 now, Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Clippers' offense fell apart like a bad alibi. Lawler noted 
that the new coach, Don Casey, explained that he had the Clippers working so 
hard on defense in practice the previous week that the offense may have 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers are like the college football player who showed his coach his 
latest report card: 4 F's and 1 D. 
</P>
<P>
"Son, looks like you've been spending too much time on one subject," the coach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that you can blame Casey. He's a defense-oriented coach, and had he not 
drilled the Clippers on defense, the Hawks might have gone for 200 points 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Casey took over a week ago, after Gene Shue had been fired a week earlier. The 
Clippers discovered they didn't like Shue's style, although apparently he is 
the same Gene Shue who coached the Clippers from '78 to '80. 
</P>
<P>
Shue has a bright future. For one thing, it's unlikely he'll be hired again to 
coach the Clippers. For another thing, the previous two coaches fired by the 
Clippers, Jim Lynam and Don Chaney, have gone on to great success. 
</P>
<P>
Lynam currently is coaching the Philadelphia 76ers, a strong second-place team 
in the Atlantic Division, and Chaney's Houston Rockets are in second in the 
Midwest Division. Being fired by the Clippers, it would seem, builds character, 
and maybe IQ. 
</P>
<P>
You have to like Casey's style, though. One of his first moves was to appoint 
Benoit Benjamin co-captain of the team, joining captain Quintin Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, this is like naming Morton Downey Jr. headmaster of your charm 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Shue had long since given up on Benjamin, and with no small justification. Shue 
benched Big Ben more than once, and often begged team ownership to trade, sell 
or waive Benoit. 
</P>
<P>
Casey tried a different approach. Give the big guy some responsibility, a 
position of leadership. Challenge him to grow up and live up to his physical 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long shot, but when you're in Casey's shoes there aren't many short 
ones. He has to work fast, turn the team around in a couple of months, or be 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what that team really needs is stability," Chaney told me last week. 
"They're a very young team. You're not going to win this year because they're 
too young. What they (management) need to do is show patience and tolerance. 
You can't make (coaching) changes every year or 2. You have to let the players 
grow with the coach." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney hints that some of the team problems might come from a level or two 
above the coach. Not a bad theory, considering that the Clippers were terrible 
when Benoit Benjamin was in grammar school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was there, there was a panel, basically (making all decisions)," Chaney 
said. "There were four people, plus me. Unwieldy? Definitely. You can't have 
five people making decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally your head coach and your general manager, Elgin Baylor, would make 
player decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"(Owner Donald) Sterling and (president Alan) Rothenberg should stay out of 
it," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Maybe because this is the team that traded away Byron Scott, Terry 
Cummings, Michael Cage and James Donaldson, with a poor overall return. Cage is 
currently eighth in the league in rebounding, Donaldson is 13th, Cummings is 
averaging 24 points and Scott has done well with some other NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' organization -- excuse the oxymoron -- is the one that wasted 
several years, players and dollars on Badfoot Bill Walton. Sterling is the guy 
who turned down a coin-flip deal with Jerry Buss, a flip that might have given 
the Clippers a rookie named James Worthy. Instead the Clippers got nobody. 
</P>
<P>
This is the team that apparently is at least considering an offer to trade Ken 
Norman, a nice-looking second-year forward, for Mark Aguirre, a 29-year-old 
almost-superstar who has made a colorful career out of feuding with coaches. 
</P>
<P>
What the Clippers need to do is what Chaney suggests: Keep the players they 
have -- with one possible exception -- find a coach the players can grow with, 
and let the new coach and Baylor make the moves. 
</P>
<P>
For a new coach, how about Paul Westhead, currently at Loyola Marymount? You 
want a running coach? He'll run your ears off. 
</P>
<P>
Good with kids? What do you think he's coaching now? And he learned a lot 
through his mistakes when coaching the Lakers and Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard call whether I'd have any interest in that (Clipper) job," 
Westhead said last week. "Right now, I'm totally captivated by what I do. I'm 
really happy with this situation." 
</P>
<P>
You hate to see a guy that happy. Make him an offer, Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Or, make Benoit Benjamin your player-coach. You have no place to go but up.

WITH MACLEAN APPEARING WEAK, UCLA COACH ORDERS BLOOD TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Don MacLean OK? 
</P>
<P>
It depends on who is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling fine," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harrick thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA basketball coach, concerned that MacLean lost 10 pounds last month as 
the Bruins played 6 of 8 games on the road, ordered blood tests this week for 
the freshman forward, who is UCLA's No. 1 scorer and No. 2 rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said that MacLean appears weak and run-down. 
</P>
<P>
"His shot's been flat," Harrick said. "He just seems to progressively be just a 
little bit off. He's missed some shots that he never missed before, and he's 
not quite as fast to the ball rebounding and defensively -- just little things 
that I've noticed. And I'm concerned about that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed it for a long time. I just hadn't said anything about it. I 
talked to his mother about it after the Arizona State game and she noticed it, 
too. She said, 'Oh, yeah, that's not the same kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested that MacLean's symptoms sounded like mononucleosis, 
Harrick said: "That's what bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean practiced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks I'm nuts," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean will be examined today by assistant team physician James Puffer. Test 
results will be known Friday.

L. A. BAPTIST PAIR ANCHOR VICTORY OVER VILLAGE CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What started out as the J. D. Strong show segued into the Reid Chobanian hour 
as L. A. Baptist took a 61-52 Alpha League victory over Village Christian at L. 
A. Baptist and pulled to within 1 game of the first-place Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
Strong got the Knights off to a fast start with 2 steals, 2 rebounds and 8 of 
his team's 15 points in the first quarter. But ultimately, it was Chobanian who 
was the difference for L. A. Baptist. The forward scored 11 of his game-high 17 
points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this game for myself and the team," Chobanian said. "I felt I was in 
the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist (16-6, 4-3 in league play) took a 32-28 halftime lead, but 
forward Mike Curl turned the momentum, scoring 9 points in the third quarter to 
pull Village Christian into a 41-41 tie by the end of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian (8-10, 5-2) came out in the fourth quarter to take a 
four-point lead behind the shooting of Scott Danielson, who fouled out with 45 
seconds to play, and David Brownfield. 
</P>
<P>
Curl fouled out with 3 minutes to play, leaving Village Christian with little 
offense. L. A. Baptist proceeded to build a margin that Village Christian could 
not bridge behind the shooting of Dave Unter -- who finished with 13 points -- 
and Chobanian. ROCKY PINHEIRO

CRESPI SETTLES INTO SECOND AFTER SURVIVING RALLY, 68-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Allen Freemon can heat up faster than an electric blanket. 
</P>
<P>
And when the St. Francis High guard catches fire, as he did in the fourth 
quarter Tuesday night against Crespi, he can burn you. 
</P>
<P>
But he is no Superman. 
</P>
<P>
Freemon's desperation 3-point shot with 1 second remaining was blocked by Pat 
Brady, preserving the Celts' 68-65 Del Rey League victory at St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Only the finishing touches were lacking on a furious rally engineered by 
Freemon, who made 5 consecutive shots, including 2 3-point baskets, to bring 
the Golden Knights back from a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Freemon 
finished with a game-high 25 points -- 13 in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be coming down here was fun, a sure win," Crespi Coach Paul Muff 
said. "But no lead is comfortable against them." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (10-9, 5-2 in league play) clinched second place with the victory. St. 
Francis (12-9, 3-4) must defeat St. John Bosco on Friday to clinch the league's 
third and final playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do anything about this game," St. Francis Coach John Jordan said. "We 
just have to get ready for St. John Bosco." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Knights had little success against Crespi in the first half. Matt 
Luderer scored 16 first-half points as the Celts took leads of 20-5 after the 
first quarter and 34-25 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Freemon, hounded by Chris McGee, scored only 7 points in the first half on 
2-of-8 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi, led by center Ken Lynch (16 points, 20 rebounds, 2 blocked shots), 
still led comfortably, 49-37, after three periods. But the St. Francis press 
forced 6 fourth-quarter turnovers and Freemon led the Golden Knights' 
resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi missed 7 of 9 free throws in the final 1:12 and St. Francis drew to 
within 68-65 on a basket by Jeff Dyrek with 26 seconds to play. After Crespi's 
Rasaan Hall missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 22 seconds left, the Golden 
Knights missed 3 shots before calling time out with 1 second remaining. But 
Brady blocked Freemon's 3-point attempt at the buzzer to preserve the Crespi 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the game didn't have a few more minutes," Muff said.

OJAI VALLEY INN LANDS SENIORS' TOURNAMENT SPURNED BY LOCAL CLUBS

The GTE West Senior Golf Classic, blown off the Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi 
Valley by 2 years of ego-flattening winds, has landed at the Ojai Valley Inn 
and Country Club in Ventura County and will be played Dec. 1-3, tournament 
officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
The new site of the event is 30 miles east of Santa Barbara and just a mile 
from Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
The course -- built in the 1920s -- was designed by Billy Bell and George C. 
Thomas Jr., the same architects who designed Riviera Country Club, Bel-Air 
Country Club and Los Angeles Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which has attracted the top seniors players, including Arnold 
Palmer, Billy Casper, Chi Chi Rodriguez and Gary Player, was played at Wood 
Ranch the past 2 years. But the powerful winds that often rake the Simi Valley 
layout caused many players to complain about the course. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament officials offered the event to 2 other Valley-area country clubs -- 
North Ranch in Thousand Oaks and Lakeside in North Hollywood -- but the boards 
of directors at those clubs rejected the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The new winter tournament is expected to have a field of 72 senior golfers.

Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn, a Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star the past 
3 seasons, is expected to be out for 3 weeks because of a strained left arch. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who has scored 20 points this season, hurt his arch during the Sockers' 
4-3 overtime loss in Dallas Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was originally thought that Quinn had torn a muscle in his foot and might 
miss up to 6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron Newman also said that it is unlikely the Sockers will sign former 
Cleveland Force defender John Stollmeyer to replace recently retired Gary 
Etherington. 
</P>
<P>
Stollmeyer is a member of the United States national team, and Newman said he 
would miss nearly half of the Sockers' remaining games if he were signed. CHRIS

MEETING IN SEASON BASEBALL OPENER TAKES EDGE OFF USD-SDSU RIVALRY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight's 60th game between the San Diego State and University of San Diego 
baseball teams will be more like a spring training affair than a long-standing 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
When the teams play at 5 p.m. at San Diego State's Smith Field, it will be the 
first time either has opened its season with the other. And at this stage, 
players are still working into shape. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played one scrimmage and the alumni game, and that's not really enough 
to get a handle on it," USD Coach John Cunningham said. "You like to play a few 
practice games in January before you get into the regular season. The guys are 
anxious to get out to see what we can do against other people." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State, ranked 15th nationally by Baseball America, leads the series 
35-23-1. But a rivalry that has been spirited over the years is diluted because 
of the opening-season date and the importance of conference play later. 
</P>
<P>
"You approach it like your season opener whether it's San Diego State or a 
Division III opponent or an NAIA school, it doesn't make any difference," 
Cunningham said. "The first game, you don't know how anybody is going to react. 
It's opening day jitters whether you're a senior or a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you can say the rivalry is as intense as when we were 
independent, and they were Division I and we were Division II. We both have our 
own conferences, and that's what we're getting ready for. But I'm sure we both 
would like to win, that's why we play." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, in his 26th year at USD, has 18 lettermen back from a 28-28 team 
that finished fourth (9-14) in the West Coast Athletic Conference and has a 
solid infield returning. 
</P>
<P>
The real story for Cunningham is finding replacements for three departed 4-year 
starters. Lost are catcher Dave Rolls, last year's WCAC co-player of the year, 
first baseman Sean Baron and outfielder Mark Trafton. They combined to hit .358 
with 146 runs, 164 runs batted in, 41 doubles, 9 triples and 32 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Those three hold virtually every offensive record we have," Cunningham said. 
"They are probably three of the finest players we've ever had at one time for a 
4-year period. That's what is kind of exciting about this club. We have six 
3-year starters . . . they've been playing second fiddle to those three guys 
who graduated." 
</P>
<P>
Among those are team captain Andy Roberts at third, Chris Bwy at second and 
Chuck Graham. Graham, scheduled to catch this season, injured his knee and will 
be the designated hitter. Sean Gousha, a freshman from Orange Glen High School, 
will catch. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, San Diego State Coach Jim Dietz, in his 17th year, returns a 
veteran team after gong 47-18-1 to win the Western Athletic Conference regular 
season championship (21-6) but failing to be recognized for an NCAA tournament 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA said the Aztecs had a weak schedule, so Dietz went out and beefed it 
up to include games against three teams that played in last spring's College 
World Series (Fresno State, Fullerton State and Florida) and just one Division 
II opponent (UC Riverside).

<P>
The biggest loss was shortstop Steve Montejano, a 4-year letterman who was a 
first-team all-WAC selection. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive returners include batting leader Harry Henderson (.391 average), 
outfielder Jeff Barry (.316, 35 stolen bases in 39 attempts) and third baseman 
Lance Pinnell (.323, 46 RBI, 11 doubles). 
</P>

Eight returning pitchers accounted for 45 of the Aztecs' victories and all 12 
of the team's saves last year, posting an era of 3.95.

PATRICK HENRY'S KENNY CAESAR FINDS HIS HOME AT LONG RANGE

Move the free-throw line back a handful of feet, and Kenny Caesar would 
probably be just fine. As it is, he might have to be content pumping in 
3-pointers like nobody's business and taking his lumps at the line. 
</P>
<P>
Caesar, a rather imposing 6-foot 3-inch point guard for Patrick Henry, was 6 
for 6 from 3-point range Tuesday during his team's 55-35 drubbing of host La 
Jolla in a nonleague boys' basketball game. He finished with a game-high 23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But from the free-throw line, he was 1 for 3. 
</P>
<P>
What gives? 
</P>
<P>
"In practice I can make 30 in a row," Caesar said. "But in the game, you have 
that one shot. You can't shoot 10 in a row. I don't want to shoot an air ball 
or something embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. The 3-pointers count for three times as many points anyway, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable taking my shots from the outside," Caesar said. 
"Everybody has told me I should be shooting more." 
</P>
<P>
It helped Tuesday. Terence Hamilton, Patrick Henry's star forward and scoring 
leader, wasn't in his usual groove. He finished with 12 but was playing hide 
and seek with his touch the whole game. La Jolla center Kyle Kupiec also 
contributed to Hamilton's problems with strong defense. So Caesar took matters 
into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed that," said Patrick Henry Coach Fritz Ziegenfuss, whose team 
improved to 11-8. "Terence had his worst shooting game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla (12-7), which lost to Patrick Henry by just 7 earlier this season, was 
mired in difficulty from the start. Point guard David Berteaux was recovering 
from food poisoning and didn't have the usual snap on his jump shot. And 
forward Adam Kleid went down in the first quarter with an ankle sprain and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure if you take both Adam and David out of the lineup, you've taken out 
34 points," La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: DUSK IS FALLING ON THE DAY OF THE RAIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever happened to the corporate raider? Only a few years after they were 
featured on magazine covers as business geniuses -- or ruthless predators -- 
who were changing corporate America, the raiders are loping into the sunset 
like gunslingers of the old West when the towns turned into cities. 
</P>
<P>
The latest news is that Carl C. Icahn, the raider who eventually took over 
Trans World Airlines, settled with Texaco, the giant oil company, and will not 
be mounting a second proxy fight at the company's annual meeting this May. (He 
lost the first proxy fight last year.) The word on Wall Street was that Icahn 
just couldn't get financing to mount a buyout of Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, T. Boone Pickens Jr., general partner of Mesa Limited Partnership, 
stated publicly the other day that he was through with corporate takeovers. 
Pickens, citing the difficulty of doing deals these days, said he may run for 
governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French raider, who hit St. Regis Paper in 1985 
and threatened Goodyear Tire in 1986, hasn't been heard from lately, nor have 
Canada's Belzbergs. Oscar Wyatt's Coastal Corp. is going after Texas Eastern, 
but the proceedings are more of a drawn-out court case than a takeover drama. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is the feverish atmosphere of yesterday: Then a raider would announce in 
the morning that he held shares in a company, other investors would jump on his 
bandwagon, and, by mid-afternoon, the company's stock would be rising in 
anticipation of a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
These days, company management has more room to maneuver and often prevails. 
Polaroid, the instant photo company, is standing off a takeover bid with 
financing from a Wall Street firm set up specifically to help managements under 
siege. Procter &amp; Gamble recently put $1 billion in an employee stock 
ownership plan as a defense against takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better Price' Than Icahn 
</P>
<P>
The changed atmosphere signals good news on the inflation front, at least so 
far as oil prices are concerned. The fact that nobody rushed in to finance 
Icahn means that speculators couldn't count on a rise in the price of oil 
making Texaco's assets more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The change also signals that institutional investors now believe that corporate 
managements know more than outsiders about how to wring value from the company 
-- as happened recently when Texaco sold its Canadian properties for more than 
$3 billion. "They got a better price than Icahn could have," says analyst Bruce 
Lazier of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, a brokerage firm. "Buyers would have 
pushed down the price, knowing Icahn was desperate to sell." 
</P>
<P>
And the change may indicate that investors are becoming more patient -- or 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
In the raiders' heyday -- the early to mid-1980s -- the great delusion was that 
if a company's stock price was lower than the full, liquidation value of its 
assets, that reflected poor management; raiders regularly promised to instantly 
boost the stock price to asset value. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Texaco's asset value per share is $67, according to the research firm 
John S. Herold Inc., while Texaco stock is selling for about $51 -- a 24% 
discount. Yet Icahn couldn't attract financing for a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? Because selling at a discount is normal for companies with natural 
assets, such as oil or timber. "Asset-rich companies always sell at a 
discount," says Texaco President James W. Kinnear, "because it takes time for 
the value to be produced. That's common sense." 
</P>
<P>
But common sense didn't prevail in the early '80s. And there's no use blaming 
the raiders; they only followed a trail blazed by big companies. The oil 
takeover game for example was begun in 1981 by DuPont, the chemical company, 
Seagrams, the liquor company, and Mobil, the oil company, as they fought over 
Conoco. Then U.S. Steel and Mobil fought for Marathon Oil. 
</P>
<P>
Later, big companies would often take advantage of the disruption caused by a 
raider to buy a competing company -- as Champion Papers did with St. Regis 
Paper after Jimmy Goldsmith had attacked it. 
</P>
<P>
Antitrust law didn't change the game, but the courts in Delaware did. (Many big 
companies are incorporated in Delaware). "The courts gave boards of directors a 
lot of discretion, unless a takeover offer was 100% cash on the barrel head," 
says David Batchelder, former executive vice president of Boone Pickens' 
company who now has his own merger advisory firm in La Jolla. As a result, the 
merger game has become too expensive for many raiders to play. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't stop the game, of course; there are still a lot of takeovers. In 
1988, according to IDD Information Services, more than $300 billion changed 
hands in 3,637 transactions. 
</P>
<P>
But now it's more a case of big companies acquiring one another -- Philip 
Morris buying Kraft, for example -- or swapping divisions to gain position in 
the market place. They no longer need the raider. When Western towns became 
urban centers, the day of the gunfighter was past.

A NEW TYPE OF TRUCK BUYER; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTY LOOKS AND EQUIPMENT ARE PUSHING PURCHASES BY WOMEN TO RECORD NUMBERS. 
THE TREND IS GAINING STEAM.

<P>
When Mary Lou Branch got rid of her Audi last fall, she says she went in for 
something "much more exciting" than the luxury import. Something equally as 
comfortable, she said, something with easier handling and "a better-looking 
interior" to boot. 
</P>
<P>
She bought a truck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 1988 Jeep Cherokee," said Branch, an Irvine secretary who traded in her 
car in October. "I had checked into a station wagon, but the old family 
vehicles seem to be getting replaced. The Jeep seemed to be nice, so -- I don't 
know -- I guess I just decided on a change." 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, she also became one of an increasing number of women who 
are eschewing expensive cars in favor of sleek, new light trucks -- pickups, 
vans and sport utility vehicles -- that have overwhelmed the U.S. automobile 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Young and old, married and single, women across the United States have been 
purchasing light trucks in record numbers over the past few years, drawn 
primarily to a look they say is as appealing as the best of luxury cars without 
diminishing traditional truck qualities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
936,000 Sales to Women 
</P>
<P>
"A man that buys a B-350 full-size pickup buys it to haul," said Elaine 
Pearson, a senior truck planner at Chrysler. "A woman would buy it for the same 
reason, but women also like the image. Trucks are becoming sportier and better 
equipped: They have power locks, power windows, rear defrosters. A few years 
ago, trucks were pretty Spartan . . . They're more user-friendly now." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, about 936,000 light trucks were sold to women in 1988, 
representing 19% of total light truck sales, according to industry estimates. 
That includes 327,000 compact vans and 214,000 compact sports utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Such presence in the light truck market is a far cry from what it was during 
the 1970s, when studies indicated that women accounted for only about 2% of 
light truck buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this boost in women purchasers accompanies an overall boom in the 
light truck industry. Light truck sales set their fourth-straight record during 
the 1988 model year, rising 4.51% to 4,838,538. Sales for the 1987 calendar 
year also rose, to 4,962,938 units, up from 4,875,708 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as dramatic as the rise in women light truck buyers appears, it is a leap 
that industry analysts predict will be dwarfed by figures 10 years from now. 
"Our projection for female truck ownership for the year 2000 is somewhere over 
30%," said Richard Anderson, the market planning manager for Ford's light truck 
division. "They are a very important part of the market." 
</P>
<P>
Women are having their greatest impact in the compact sport utility market, 
where they already account for 30% of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upscale Market 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the 81,349 Suzuki Samurai utility vehicles purchased last year, 
nearly 40% of them were bought by women, prompting Jean Pellegrino, an analyst 
at J. D. Power &amp; Associates, to declare the trendy vehicle "the outstanding 
leader among sales to women." 
</P>
<P>
Women also buy about 20% of the pricier Dodge Raider, Chevy Blazer and Jeep 
Wagoneer models sold each year, according to Pellegrino. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are quick to note that these expensive specialty trucks are being 
bought by professional women who can easily afford high-priced automobiles. 
"It's that whole yuppie thing that has driven the light truck market upscale," 
remarked Pearson. "That's why the sport utilities sell well." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in spite of the hefty sums now going toward the sleek sport utility 
vehicles -- the Jeep Cherokee, the Bronco II, Nissan's Pathfinder and the like 
-- industry observers credit the relatively cheaper compact vans and mini-vans 
for spurring the light truck craze among women. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, women account for 22% of compact van sales -- which coincidently 
have leaped 22% in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, compact vans have displaced station wagons as the vehicle most 
popular with American suburban families. Keying this upsurge, observed car and 
truck dealers, are women homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Married women seem to be coming in more and more," said Harold Peters, the 
sales manager of La Brea Dodge in Los Angeles. "They definitely like the 
Caravan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Buy Full-Size Trucks 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of housewives buy the Aerostar," added Terry Emerson, a salesman at Los 
Feliz Ford in Glendale. "They seem to love it. They can use the vans for the 
kids, to haul groceries, all kinds of things. The Aerostars are popular with 
some couples, too. The vans are what the station wagon used to be." 
</P>
<P>
But, despite their importance to the overall market and most individual models, 
women seem to have had little effect on the full-size pickup market, which has 
traditionally been men's turf. There, women account for only 5% of the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say price" is one of the major reasons the full-size pickup trucks 
don't sell well to women, said Pellegrino. "Handling is another. Most of these 
women are younger, and they don't have a need for a full-size truck." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, interest among women in the other models has provided truck 
makers more than enough incentive to tailor their vehicles to the needs of both 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of women drivers, for example, most of the makers of 
mini-vans and compact trucks have lengthened the tracks that seats slide along 
so that the seats can be moved closer to the steering wheel. They have also 
added power locks and windows, lowered the steps to make it easier to get in 
the trucks and positioned the steering wheel to better conform to the 
dimensions of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, as part of their attempts to better understand women buyers, some 
truck makers have developed or revamped marketing teams to pinpoint the 
specific needs of female customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Women's Marketing Manual' 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, for instance, has restructured its 10-year-old women's marketing 
group to draw on the expertise of executives throughout the auto concern. 
</P>
<P>
"We do from time to time identify typical things a woman can't reach because 
it's made for someone bigger," said Chrysler's Pearson. "Broken fingernails (on 
truck dashboards) are a pet peeve we hear about a lot, too. We try to correct 
things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said Ford now publishes a "Women's Marketing Manual" for its 
employees. "We try to impress on our sales force that women are a very 
important part of the market," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Such attentiveness and modifications to trucks and vans -- along with price a 
range of $10,000 to $15,000 -- have combined to create vehicles with wider 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"My Bronco is really cute," said Kate Collins, a real estate appraiser in 
Burbank who gave up a BMW for a Ford Bronco II. "I also own a horse and a dog, 
and I like to take my dog with me to the barn where my horse is. With the 
truck, I have room to take my dog and throw a bale of hay in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still have it more for comfort than anything. It rides better than my 
BMW." 
</P>
<P>
Added Emerson of Los Feliz Ford: "Women love these trucks. Everywhere I've been 
it's like that, especially with those Wranglers and Jeeps and small pickups. 
Whenever I ask them why they want a truck, they go, 'Because it's cheap, it's 
sporty and it's the trend.' "

SETTLEMENT IN B OF A HOLDERS' SUIT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court Tuesday approved the settlement of a shareholder 
lawsuit against BankAmerica, clearing the way for the distribution of $21.1 
million to about 35,000 stockholders and former stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in San 
Francisco, unanimously affirmed a settlement approved by a federal judge in Los 
Angeles in January, 1988. A former bank employee had filed an objection to the 
settlement, but the court rejected his arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement resolved a series of lawsuits brought by shareholders who had 
accused the parent of Bank of America of concealing its financial problems in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"People are likely to begin receiving their money later this year," said 
Richard Greenfield, one of the attorneys who sued the San Francisco-based 
banking company. 
</P>
<P>
The money will go to people who have filed claims showing that they purchased 
BankAmerica stock between March 8, 1984, and Aug. 1, 1986. Legal fees of about 
$3 million will be subtracted from the $21.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also provides that BankAmerica receive $39.25 million from its 
former insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau, Wis. The insurer will also pay 
the bank an additional $8.2 million to cover a portion of the losses suffered 
by Bank of America in an unrelated mortgage-backed securities scheme in 1985.

A firm owned by former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali filed suit in 
federal court in Los Angeles, seeking more than $550 million from two companies 
that allegedly signed contracts for big batches of Muhammad Ali shoe polish but 
then refused to accept them. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, names the 
K mart Corp. and Melville Corp. and alleges racial discrimination, breach of 
contract, emotional distress, conspiracy and antitrust violations. Spokesmen 
for the two companies declined comment.

Eastern Airlines rejected binding arbitration in the 16-month-old contract 
dispute with its largest union. The National Mediation Board began mediating 
the Eastern-Machinists talks a year ago. Under its rules, the refusal of one of 
the parties to submit to binding arbitration will lead to declaration of an 
impasse. That triggers a 30-day "cooling-off period." If there is no 
settlement, the union may strike and the company may impose its own work 
conditions on the union employees.

HOMECLUB ENLISTS NEW AD AGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIS, BALL &amp; COLOMBATTO THE VICTOR IN STIFF COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most sought-after pieces of business in the Los Angeles advertising 
market -- the $15-million HomeClub account -- has been won by a Los Angeles ad 
agency, the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto, the firm that created the popular "Mac Tonight" 
ad campaign for McDonald's, emerged the winner after a harrowing review that at 
one time included more than 50 Los Angeles ad agencies vying for the business. 
</P>
<P>
By early spring, TV viewers will no longer hear HomeClub's familiar ad slogan, 
"Save on everything every day," said Sean Lee, president and chief executive of 
the Fullerton-based HomeClub. Instead, the nation's second-largest home 
improvement chain said it now plans to do battle with No. 1 Home Depot by 
talking less about low prices and more about variety. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that campaign was too one dimensional," Lee said. "There's more to 
life than prices." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee reluctantly conceded that HomeClub's current hard-hitting ad campaign 
that compares its low prices to that of rival Home Depot has been extremely 
successful. Indeed, that campaign was so successful that Home Depot recently 
reacted by luring away the Los Angeles agency that created it, Admarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, HomeClub's new agency also said that ads about low prices are 
becoming old hat. "Advertising low prices is not unique to this category," said 
Brad Ball, president of Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto, which now plans to hire 
six employees to handle the new business. "We're going to break out of the pack 
and attack." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Scare Customers 
</P>
<P>
Analysts who follow the big home improvement chain agree that ads bragging 
about lower prices are beginning to sound like broken records. "These stores 
have all identified themselves as having low prices," said Bo Cheadle, general 
partner at the San Francisco-based investment firm Montgomery Securities. 
"People need to hear some reason other than price to go there." 
</P>
<P>
After all, the massive size of the stores -- and the large crowds that shop 
there -- can often scare many potential customers away. "The guy who just wants 
a hammer and nails to fix a broken fence sure isn't going to walk in to one of 
these," Cheadle said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to help coax that customer into HomeClub, Lee said, his company is eyeing 
an ad campaign that will instead focus on the convenience of getting everything 
at one store -- and the wide assortment of goods. 
</P>
<P>
But the real catalyst behind HomeClub's move was some recent actions by its 
chief rival, Home Depot, and HomeClub's former Los Angeles advertising agency, 
Admarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Admarketing quit the $15-million HomeClub ad business to take 
on the $25-million account of Home Depot, the Atlanta chain that is the 
undisputed industry leader. The move not only forced HomeClub to seek out a new 
ad firm, but also to rethink its marketing strategy. At the same time, HomeClub 
filed suit to try to block Admarketing from creating ads for Home Depot for one 
year. That suit has yet to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boom in Southland 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business continues to boom for retailers that service the nation's 
estimated $90-billion home improvement sector. And giants such as Home Depot 
and HomeClub are all vying for a bigger piece of it. After all, the major 
chains still account for less than 15% of all home improvement sales -- most of 
which are handled by hardware stores and small suppliers at strip centers. 
</P>
<P>
The home improvement business is growing especially fast in Southern 
California, where the escalating real estate market has persuaded many 
homeowners to fix up their own homes instead of moving. Indeed, industry 
experts say that Southern California homeowners spent an estimated $10 billion 
on home improvements last year. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 stores in Southern California and five more planned here over the next 
year, HomeClub says it plans to bolster its local advertising. And while its 
new ad agency certainly doesn't want to lay a brick with its first ad campaign 
-- it might have to. 
</P>
<P>
After all, bricks are HomeClub's best-selling item -- with sales of some 13 
million bricks annually. "Don't be surprised," joked ad man Ball, "if that 
doesn't end up in the theme line."

<P>
The Bush Administration, still struggling over options for financing the 
bailout of troubled savings institutions, sought Tuesday to resuscitate its 
plan to tax depositors -- by repackaging it as an increase in the federal 
deposit insurance premium charged to S&amp;Ls and banks. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the proposal is among a series of options that 
will be sent to President Bush later this week, in time for him to make 
preliminary recommendations to include in his Feb. 9 budget revisions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say increasing the federal insurance premiums would have essentially 
the same impact as a direct tax on depositors, because banks and S&amp;Ls 
almost certainly would pass on most or all of the cost to depositors through 
fees or lower interest on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
However, it would presumably be more politically salable than the scheme for 
direct taxes on depositors, which has already been castigated by members of 
Congress. White House aides continue to back both proposals, but officials 
concede that the depositor-tax plan is crippled. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Administration officials said Tuesday that any Bush proposal to 
deal with troubled S&amp;Ls is also likely to contain a spate of new reform 
measures designed to reduce prospects that the current crisis might reemerge. 
</P>
<P>
They said these include increasing the minimum amounts of capital that thrift 
institutions must maintain to back up their outstanding loans and toughening 
regulation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and other federal regulatory 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as a divided Senate Banking Committee split sharply over 
whether to push for an immediate infusion of funds to shut down crippled 
S&amp;Ls or to opt for a longer-term package that includes tougher regulation 
and reform of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), calling for a prompt cash infusion, warned that 
Congress must act "as fast as we can to stop the hemorrhaging" or costs will 
escalate substantially and will push some S&amp;Ls "to the brink." 
</P>
<P>
But panel Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), supported by conservative 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), opted for a more comprehensive package that would 
include restructuring the troubled industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our only real lever to bring about fundamental changes is to do this as a 
package," Riegle said. And Gramm warned the panel that without "pressure" from 
the financial crisis, Congress would not be able to enact regulatory reform. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced new regulations Tuesday 
that will sharply restrict the ability of insolvent S&amp;Ls to invest in 
so-called junk bonds -- bonds that pay high interest rates but carry more risk 
than investment-grade bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which regulates about 3,000 federally insured S&amp;Ls, said its 
new guidelines will prohibit insolvent S&amp;Ls from making new investments in 
junk bonds and will require them to sell their current holdings unless they are 
approved by bank board regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Solvent but shaky institutions that do not meet capital requirements will be 
required to get government approval before buying junk bonds. Existing 
regulations permit the purchase of junk bonds, but institutions can invest no 
more than 5% of their portfolios in a single fund. 
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, junk bonds have been a profitable investment for 
many S&amp;Ls. Analysts worry, however, that if the issuing companies default 
during an economic downturn, S&amp;Ls will be stuck for a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the S&amp;L problem dominated comments by members of 
congressional banking committees Tuesday. House Banking Committee Chairman 
Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said he strongly opposes any new charge on checking 
and savings accounts, whether imposed as a direct tax on deposits or as an 
increase in insurance premiums paid by institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In Senate Banking Committee testimony, the panel heard a pessimistic review of 
the S&amp;L problem from Lowell L. Bryan, a director of McKinsey &amp; Co., who 
predicted that it now would cost at least $100 billion to close or sell ailing 
savings and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
In similar testimony 15 months ago, Bryan had forecast that $100 billion was 
the maximum that would be needed to resolve the problem. "Now," because of 
rising interest rates, "$100 billion is a minimum figure," Bryan told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Premiums 
</P>
<P>
Bryan's figures substantially exceed the estimates of the Bush Administration, 
which figures that the total S&amp;L rescue effort will eventually cost only 
about $90 billion -- some $40 billion of which has already been spent during 
bailout operations in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The latest of the options that the Administration is considering would increase 
the premiums on federal deposit insurance paid by both S&amp;Ls and commercial 
banks. Banks now pay one-twelfth of 1% of their deposits, while S&amp;Ls pay 
about 2 1/2 times that rate. 
</P>
<P>
However, some officials cautioned Tuesday that the plan to tax depositors 
directly still has not been formally rejected and that it will be considered by 
Bush with three or four other proposals being compiled by the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
There were some indications that the Administration may seek to combine 
portions of both proposals -- that is, couple a much reduced direct fee on 
depositors with a small increase in the premiums charged to federally insured 
lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both Administration officials and congressional leaders say 
taxpayer money will probably wind up financing the bulk of the bill for the 
bailout, no matter which options Bush ultimately chooses. 
</P>
<P>
That is how the financial community wants it. The S&amp;L and banking 
industries Tuesday reaffirmed their strong opposition to any increase in their 
insurance costs, whether through a tax levied on consumers or through a boost 
in the industry's premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Assn., had no use for 
the increase in the insurance premium charged to financial institutions. "We 
think it's the same idea just repackaged, and it's a bad idea," she said. "It's 
still a consumer tax, once removed." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Webber, president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, agreed. The 
higher S&amp;L charge is already too onerous, he told reporters. "We just can't 
afford it," he said; "we would like to pay less."

N.J. SEEKS TO BAN DREXEL IN CASINO DEALS; 
</P>
<P>
NEVADA IS REVIEWING SUITABILITY AS LENDER

The damage that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. may suffer from criminal charges 
began to spread Tuesday as New Jersey gaming officials asked the state's Casino 
Control Commission to bar the investment firm at least temporarily from doing 
business with Atlantic City casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel estimates that it has provided 70% of the long-term financing for the 
New Jersey gaming industry since casino gambling started in Atlantic City in 
1979. Most of the financing was provided through the sale of high-yield, 
high-risk "junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Nevada's top gaming regulator said in an interview 
that his state's authorities also are examining Drexel's suitability as a 
lender to casinos. But he declined to predict whether Nevada will take any 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed Tuesday with the New Jersey casino commission, Anthony J. 
Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, said he 
was seeking to ban Drexel from financing any casino deals because of the six 
criminal charges filed against Drexel by the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
Manhattan on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Parrillo asked for the ban while a review is completed of Drexel's November, 
1987, application for a casino service industry license, which is required of 
companies doing business with casino operators. Under New Jersey law, 
applicants normally may continue to conduct that business while their 
applications are pending. But Parrillo said the right can be revoked if the 
firms are accused of serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Active in Nevada 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Parrillo said Tuesday's action was "designed to effect 
a severance of Drexel from casino business in New Jersey" until the criminal 
case is disposed of and the state's license application has been fully 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also is heavily involved in financing the gaming industry in Nevada. Its 
combined financing of purchases, construction or reorganizations of Las Vegas 
and Atlantic City casinos is estimated at $5 billion. William Bible, chairman 
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said in an interview that the board was 
collecting information on the pending criminal and Securities and Exchange 
Commission charges against Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Bible said the Nevada board's review was in connection with Interface Group 
Inc.'s application for a license to operate the Sands hotel-casino in Las 
Vegas. Drexel provided much of the financing for the Massachusetts-based 
company's recent purchase of the Sands for $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bible said that if the board finds Drexel an unsuitable lender in the Sands 
deal, it would "send a message" that the board might not approve similar deals 
involving Drexel. But he said he didn't know yet if such action was likely. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel is expected to plead guilty to the six federal criminal charges in New 
York as soon as it completes talks with the SEC on settling separate civil 
charges of stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. Criminal 
indictments are expected to be filed against junk bond king Michael Milken and 
several other Drexel employees. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the fallout from Drexel's decision to plead guilty to criminal charges 
has been relatively mild. The New York City government and the state of 
Wisconsin banned the firm from participating in the sale of a small number of 
new issues of municipal bonds. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
barred the firm from underwriting junk bond issues to bail out insolvent Texas 
savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Market Share 
</P>
<P>
And one prominent corporate client of Drexel's, Stone Container Corp., 
reportedly has said it is unlikely to hire Drexel again to bring to market new 
issues of securities because of the criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the overall effect on Drexel's profits is believed to be negligible. 
Despite the publicity surrounding the investigation of the firm, last year it 
increased its dominance of the hugely profitable junk bond business to a 42.8% 
share of the market from 40% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear whether the New Jersey action or possible action in Nevada 
might have a more significant effect on the firm. A Drexel spokesman declined 
to say how much profit the firm has earned from its investment banking services 
to Atlantic City casino companies. But the documents filed by New Jersey gaming 
officials state that the firm has earned fees "in excess of $120 million" over 
the past 10 years from the companies. If so, that would represent only a tiny 
portion of Drexel's profits. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Drexel noted Tuesday that the firm would be granted a 
hearing by the New Jersey commission before it acts on Parrillo's request 
within the next few weeks. The firm said that "since Drexel has provided more 
than $2.5 billion of capital -- 70% of all permanent funds raised -- for the 
New Jersey gaming industry, we know that public confidence and trust in the 
regulatory process is essential." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said that, based on new procedures it will be implementing on its own 
and because of the current negotiations with the SEC, "we believe that we will 
be able to qualify for licensure shortly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reversed Position 
</P>
<P>
Parrillo declined to estimate how long the full review of Drexel may take. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel initially balked at New Jersey gaming authorities' request that it apply 
for a license. The firm originally had maintained that it wasn't required to do 
so under New Jersey law. But it reversed its position in 1987 and filed an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big deals that Drexel has helped finance in Atlantic City were Golden 
Nugget Inc.'s construction of a casino in 1980. Since then, Drexel has been 
involved in many transactions, including marketing securities worth more than 
$1.3 billion to finance Holiday Inns Inc.'s casino ventures, and securities 
worth $325 million in 1988 to finance Griffin Resorts Inc.'s acquisition of 
Resorts International Inc.

A California computer firm has agreed to pay $7.4 million to settle claims that 
one of its units improperly charged the Pentagon on contracts, the Justice 
Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The department said it had reached the agreement with Computer &amp; 
Communications Technology Corp. of San Diego and the subsidiary, Zeta 
Laboratories Inc. of San Jose, to settle a government claim that the Defense 
Department was defrauded on contract charges between 1983 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged improprieties were discovered in June, 1986, when Whittaker Corp. 
acquired Zeta from CCT, the department said. Whittaker canceled that deal. 
</P>
<P>
The companies agreed to pay $1 million plus interest in four installments and 
remit the balance after CCT sells the Zeta subsidiary.

STOCK PRICES, REBOUNDING IN LATE TRADING, CONTINUE RALLY; DOW UP 18

The stock market finished higher Tuesday after rebounding briskly late in the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials jumped 18.21 to 2,342.32, its highest 
close since the October, 1987, market crash and its third-straight finish over 
2,300 since the collapse. The widely watched blue chip barometer had lost as 
much as 15 points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a market that shows resilience," said Monte Gordon, director of 
research at Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The comeback reinforced market players' belief that many foreign investors and 
U.S. institutions have been reassured by a strong dollar and apparently sound 
economy -- and are ready to jump on the Wall Street bandwagon that began 
rolling last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I remain bullish on the market," said Peter DaPuzzo, manager of the retail 
equity group at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "I think the ingredients are still 
there for the market to continue with the rally." 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 194.05 million shares, up from 167.83 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market weakened early Tuesday from profit taking in the 
aftermath of last week's impressive rally, which continued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's bullish enthusiasm also was dampened somewhat by comments Tuesday 
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, analysts said. Among other 
things, Greenspan told Congress' Joint Economic Committee that the potential 
threat of inflation persists in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
After the market tested lower levels, however, it bounced back late in the day 
and again showed the strength marking its recent rally. As the Dow Jones index 
of 30 industrials fell toward the 2,300 level, a massive buying surge was 
triggered. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices ended mixed in Tokyo, helped by last-minute buying that wiped away 
early losses. The 225-share Nikkei index firmed 13.80 points to 31,581.30, 
against Monday's 111.57-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the depressing effect of early weakness on Wall Street, share prices on 
the London stock exchange continued to surge ahead. At the close of trading, 
the Financial Times 100-share index was up 8.9 at 2,051.8. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar surged to three-month highs after Greenspan said the U.S. trade 
deficit would shrink in coming months without a decline in the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices, meanwhile, fell to their lowest level in two years, continuing the 
downward trend that began last Friday when they broke below $400 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also said the Fed's efforts to boost interest rates would not lead to 
a recession but would extend the current expansion by keeping inflation under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers took the remarks to mean that the U.S. central bank was 
unconcerned by the dollar's recent rise and was willing to keep interest rates 
tight, something that would make dollar-denominated investments attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Greenspan today," said Kathryn Curtin, assistant treasurer of the 
National Australia Bank Ltd. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers have been focusing on firm U.S. interest rates this year rather than 
the budget and trade deficits that preoccupied them last year. 
</P>
<P>
The price of gold fell sharply in New York after having been little changed 
earlier in the Far East and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The (precious) metals have just done nothing for so long and they have to test 
their lows before they can go higher. . . . It's a matter of water seeking its 
proper level," said Alan Posnick, senior vice president of MTB Banking Corp. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $391.60 an ounce from $395.30 Monday. Later, Republic National Bank of New 
York said bullion was bid at $390.80 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from 
$394.35 late Monday.

The onslaught of colder weather and an expected drop in meat demand during Lent 
influenced futures prices for some farm commodities, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean prices were up sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were bolstered by unexpectedly high weekly export inspection figures and 
a report from Sparks Commodities, a private crop analyst, that pegged 
Argentina's soybean crop lower than U.S. Agriculture Department estimates, said 
Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>

"A weather forecast calling for bitter cold temperatures in wheat growing areas

Livestock and meat futures prices were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile

</P>
<P>
Cash prices were helpful for both cattle and hog futures, said Jerry Gidel,

ATARI SUES NINTENDO, ACCUSES RIVAL OF MONOPOLIZING GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Nintendo of America, maker of the red-hot video game system, was sued Monday 
for $250 million by archrival Atari Corp., which accused Nintendo of unfairly 
monopolizing the billion-dollar video game market. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the second in as many months charging Nintendo with illegally 
locking competitors out of the lucrative and fast-growing video game market. In 
December, Atari Games Corp., which is unrelated to Atari Corp., filed a similar 
suit for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that if the legal maneuvers are successful, Nintendo stands 
to lose the hold it has on up to 85% of what analysts estimate will be a 
$2.3-billion market for video games this year. 
</P>
<P>
A Nintendo spokeswoman said late Tuesday that the company was unaware of the 
Atari Corp. suit and could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
Filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Atari Corp.'s suit alleges 
that Nintendo has monopolized the video game market by preventing creators of 
games licensed for for Nintendo systems from selling those games for use on 
competing video game systems, such as those make by Atari. 
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, Atari says "developers are faced with the choice between 
selling games only to Nintendo customers or not selling." As a result, Atari 
says game creators -- fully aware of Nintendo's strong market position -- 
"yield to coercion from Nintendo" and leave Atari and other manufacturers of 
video game consoles unable to obtain many popular games for use on their own 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
An Atari official likened the arrangement to a computer manufacturer ordering a 
software publisher not to create a version of a popular program that could 
operate on a competitor's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply doesn't happen that way in the computer world, and it shouldn't 
happen in the video game world either," said Joshua Tropper, an attorney for 
Atari Corp. "We want customers to be able to buy hot games that can be played 
on our systems, not just Nintendo's." 
</P>
<P>
At issue, Tropper said, is the licensing agreement that Nintendo requires game 
developers to sign. The developer agrees that it will not create versions of a 
video game to operate on rival systems, such as Sega or Atari. The three video 
game systems each use separate operating systems, and games for one machine 
cannot be used on a competing one. 
</P>
<P>
The suit from Atari Games -- a creator of video games, not video game consoles 
-- charged that Nintendo freezes out rival game makers by requiring them to put 
their games on Nintendo-made game cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nintendo, which also publishes games produced by its own staff, says 
the requirement ensures high quality standards for all games designed for its 
systems, Atari Games said it effectively allows Nintendo to ration the number 
of games produced by rival game creators. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Games has further challenged Nintendo by producing games on its own that 
can operate on the Nintendo system. Nintendo has challenged the move as an 
illegal appropriation of the proprietary technology in its game systems.

DWP RECEIVES BAD NEWS FROM SNOW READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MAMMOTH LAKES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two water surveyors pushed the hollow aluminum tube vertically into the 
snow, pulled it out and read the bad news for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not much," said Terry Beitler of the city's Department of Water and 
Power as he looked at the tube filled with snow. 
</P>
<P>
Beitler and his partner, Chuck Maurer, were measuring the snowpack on the 
eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, which provides Los Angeles with much of its 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings confirmed that the pack was smaller than it has been since the 
drought of 1976 and 1977. And there was more bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Inside their hollow pole they also found the wrong kind of snow. It was powdery 
snow with much less water than the wet, heavy snow -- called Sierra Cement -- 
that usually hits the mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
Beitler and Maurer were participating in the first of the three major snow 
surveys that will be made in the Sierra Nevada before the spring thaw. Other 
crews began similar measurements Tuesday throughout the mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
All confirmed what every skier knows: Not much snow yet this winter. A dry 
January in the Sierra has raised fears California may suffer a third year of 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's DWP survey, 10,000 feet up Mammoth Mountain, showed that the snowpack 
on the eastern side of the Sierra was only 70% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water for Aqueduct 
</P>
<P>
From these mountains flows the water for the aqueduct from nearby Owens Valley 
to Los Angeles. This is Los Angeles' cheapest, most plentiful and purest water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the city water comes from wells in the San Fernando Valley, some of 
which are polluted, and from the Colorado River and Northern California sources 
of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles' rainfall has been about 85% of normal so far this winter, 
making the drought seem remote, around Mammoth Lakes 285 miles northeast of the 
city precipitation has been 37% of normal, a DWP official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a lot of rain in Los Angeles, but it has no correlation with how 
much water we have because we get our water here," said Randy Neudeck, a DWP 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Without a sharp increase in snowfall, officials said, DWP reservoirs will be 
below capacity at winter's end. At present, they said, DWP reservoirs are at 
70% of capacity; Northern California reservoirs at 65% and Colorado River 
reservoirs at 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the situation is the powdery nature of the eastern Sierra snowpack 
caused by atmospheric conditions, according to Duane Buchholz, assistant 
aqueduct engineer. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident when Beitler and Maurer pulled out the tube after pushing it 
more than 40 inches into the snow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snow Course' 
</P>
<P>
They did their work on a snow course, a flat area where snow has been measured 
the past 52 years to provide an accurate record of snow patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath the snow was a snow pillow, a large rubber sack filled with 
antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
As the snow presses down on the pillow and the antifreeze, instruments are 
activated, telling the depth and weight of the snow. These pillows are placed 
throughout the Sierra, some capable of sending their information to satellites 
and then to laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
But every pillow must be checked by surveyors. Some must snow-shoe or ski to 
remote survey points. 
</P>
<P>
After weighing the snow-filled tube, Beitler said it contained enough water to 
reach a level of seven inches in the tube if it were melted. 
</P>
<P>
In past years with the snow heavier and wetter, a similar amount of snow would 
have contained about three times as much water. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said this means that the runoff from the eastern Sierra into the 
creeks and the natural underground reservoirs of the Owens Valley will be below 
normal again this year unless February and March are especially stormy months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Normal for Sierra' 
</P>
<P>
Nobody up here is ruling that out. After swapping stories with other DWP 
workers on the Sierra's eastern slope, Beitler said, "The longer I live up 
here, I realize there is nothing normal for the Sierra." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Department of Water and Power, like other water agencies around 
the state, are preparing for a third year of drought. 
</P>
<P>
They intend to continue to sell the city's conservation program, which 
generally is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
And they intend to launch a three-year program of cloud-seeding along the 
eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said tests and cloud-seeding operations in 24 countries over the 
past 30 years have shown that precipitation can be increased from 5% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $100,000 for a year of cloud seeding in this area, they said.

POLICE REFORMS WILL BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council agreed Tuesday to study a proposal by a group of 
clergymen who demanded reforms in the Police Department to address allegations 
of racism and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Calling themselves the "Concerned Clergy of Long Beach," more than a dozen 
ministers and rabbis asked the council to beef up human relations training for 
officers, open a police substation in a minority neighborhood and create a 
citizen oversight panel to hear police brutality complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Their demands arise from a Jan. 14 incident in which a white police officer 
allegedly cursed at a black man and pushed his head through a plate glass 
window during a confrontation. The incident was taped for NBC's "Today Show," 
which was doing a story on an anti-police brutality group that was conducting a 
"sting" operation to demonstrate police abuses.

SUICIDE ENDS 4-HOUR STANDOFF WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman in Malibu shot and killed himself Tuesday after threatening to shoot 
his mother and sister during a 4 1/2-hour standoff that created a massive 
traffic jam on Pacific Coast Highway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's Special Weapons Team entered the home, located 
on the highway near the exclusive Malibu Colony, about 12:30 p.m. and found 
Mitchell McClellan Roberts, 25, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, 
Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after 8 a.m. when the Malibu sheriff's station 
received a call from Roberts' frantic sister, who said he had threatened to 
kill her and their mother following an argument, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The two women fled the home unharmed, but when deputies established telephone 
contact with Roberts, he vowed to kill anyone who interfered with his plans to 
commit suicide, Ramirez said. They subsequently heard a gunshot and the line 
went dead. 
</P>
<P>
During the incident, deputies surrounded the home and evacuated nearby 
residences, while the California Highway Patrol blocked the highway.

WASTE INCINERATOR DISPUTE PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dispute over whether the state's first full-scale commercial hazardous 
waste incinerator can be built in Vernon without an environmental impact study 
was put on hold Tuesday pending a hearing March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which had said it would not 
renew previously granted construction permits expiring today, agreed to extend 
those permits until the hearing date set by Superior Court Judge Dzintra 
Janavs. 
</P>
<P>
California Thermal Treatment Service agreed to take no new action toward 
construction of the incinerator in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing was on the company's application for a temporary restraining 
order to prevent the AQMD from failing to renew the permits it originally 
issued with the declaration that a full-scale environmental study was not 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles and various environmental groups have protested the 
lack of an environmental impact study, however, and in December the AQMD 
reversed itself, informing the company that the permits would not be renewed 
without a study and tougher emission controls.

COUNTY MAY TIE FUNDS TO TRAFFIC LIGHT COORDINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors sought Tuesday to put some political muscle 
behind efforts to control traffic congestion, voting to explore a proposal to 
withhold county road funds from local cities unless they agree to synchronize 
their traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which could affect $10 million that the county distributes each year 
to cities, won the unanimous backing of supervisors and reflected the 
frustrations of county officials who must deal with myriad communities in 
trying to coordinate traffic signals. The county Department of Public Works is 
already involved in some 13 traffic projects and has identified 80 major routes 
for traffic synchronization, said director Thomas A. Tidemanson. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he cited a boulevard that has 75 traffic signals in nine 
different cities. But when Tidemanson told supervisors that some cities have 
been reluctant to work with the county in coordinating traffic, the board 
proposed withholding the dollars as "a big stick" approach aimed at persuading 
cities to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time we send the message to these cities that they no longer will 
get this money from the county without any strings," said Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Ed Edelman. "We have tremendous traffic and gridlock in this county, 
and we can't widen the streets as we once did because we don't have the funds 
we once did, so we have to use advanced techniques to move traffic using 
existing signals." 
</P>
<P>
Tidemanson said the money the county distributes to cities comes from its 
percentage of gasoline tax revenue. The funds are distributed based on a 
population and street mileage formula, he said. In addition, the supervisors 
agreed to seek additional money for the synchronization program by turning over 
operation of the county's freeway call box system to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. The commission is seeking to acquire the call box 
system as part of a new program for improved handling of freeway emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been requesting $2 million for the call box system, but thus 
far, the commission has offered only $1.1 million. On Tuesday, the Board of 
Supervisors agreed to urge its appointees on the commission to push for the 
high figure.

ANTI-AIDS BIAS PLAN SURVIVES OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a proposed anti-AIDS discrimination ordinance for Los Angeles 
County showed up in force Tuesday intent on forcing the Board of Supervisors to 
overturn its support for a law that they claim would compel health-care workers 
and others to run the risk of contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest public protest so far to the anti-discrimination law, but 
there was no indication that the public lobbying had changed any minds. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors tentatively approved the sweeping ordinance in a 3-2 vote more than 
two weeks ago. It would bar employers, landlords, schools and businesses in the 
county's unincorporated areas from discriminating against those who have or are 
suspected of having acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which is to be be up for final vote next Tuesday, would make it 
illegal to exclude AIDS victims, people infected with the AIDS virus or those 
an employer suspects of carrying the virus from jobs and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is milder than similar laws, in Los Angeles for example, that 
call for special enforcement by the city attorney's office. The county law 
would leave it up to individuals to initiate complaints through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Forcing People' 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ordinance contend that the county proposal is untenable and 
protects AIDS victims at the expense of health-care professionals, restaurant 
workers and others who fear that even nonsexual contact with an infected person 
can spread AIDS. Under the proposed county law, people with such fears could 
not legally refuse to treat or serve people with AIDS or who are suspected of 
having AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop the AIDS epidemic, but not by forcing people to become exposed 
(to the virus)," said Leslie C. Dutton, president of the American Assn. of 
Women, an archconservative organization. 
</P>
<P>
LaVonne Wilenken, a registered nurse and president of the California Nurses for 
Ethical Standards, told supervisors that her experience in hospital maternity 
wards shows that even such precautions as using protective gloves are 
inadequate in safeguarding health-care workers from infected blood or other 
fluids. 
</P>
<P>
"I have little children at home, and I love my job," said Wilenken, "but I'm 
here to tell you that we're not protected, and . . . what's going to happen is 
I'm going to have to quit doing what it is that I love." 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus is spread primarily through exchanges of semen and blood, 
usually through sexual contact or contaminated hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, the American Medical Assn. and other 
professionals have said that doctors and nurses have a professional 
responsibility to provide care for people with AIDS and that the risk of 
infection is minimal if proper precautions are observed. A small number of 
health-care workers have contracted the virus through accidental punctures from 
needles contaminated with infected blood. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the county Commission on AIDS, which pushed for the ordinance, have 
said the law is needed to quickly resolve discrimination complaints and to 
ensure that those afflicted with AIDS do not hide their infection because of 
fears that they will be victims of bias. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, who chairs the United AIDS Coalition, an umbrella group for 
organizations that help AIDS sufferers, backed the proposed law and said 
Tuesday that it would send a strong message that "all human life is valuable 
and worthy of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
In postponing a final vote until next week, board chairman Ed Edelman sought to 
ensure that the three supervisors who originally backed the ordinance would be 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, a conservative, had joined his liberal colleagues, 
Edelman and Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, in approving the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Dana was out of town Tuesday, so opponents of the proposed law, which included 
a number of black constituents from Hahn's South-Central Los Angeles district, 
zeroed in on him in hopes of persuading him to reconsider his vote. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn remained silent in the face of their pleadings, however, and later his 
chief deputy, Mas Fukai, said his boss has no intention of switching his vote.

L.A. COUNCIL TAKES 1ST STEP TOWARD A BAN ON SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a rash of killings involving the AK-47 assault rifle, the Los Angeles City 
Council on Tuesday moved to ban the sale and possession of military-style 
semiautomatic weapons within the city. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous action gave the city attorney one week to draft a law. But even 
its main sponsor, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, conceded that the ordinance may 
be vulnerable to legal attack. Yaroslavsky added, however, that even if 
unenforceable, the city ban will offer a symbolic boost to state efforts to 
outlaw the high-powered rifles. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Councilman Nate Holden, the council also called on President 
Bush to order a ban on importing assault weapons and urged local gun dealers to 
agree to stop selling such rifles as the AK-47, Uzi and AR-15. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Holden and a Los Angeles radio station have offered up to $300 
for each rifle turned over to police. So far, 68 have been collected, police 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's council votes came on the heels of several recent shootings in which 
assault rifles were involved. The most prominent incident was a Jan. 17 tragedy 
in which five Stockton schoolchildren were slain by an AK-47-toting gunman, 
Patrick Edward Purdy, who later fatally shot himself. Twenty-nine other 
students and a teacher were wounded in the hail of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
An Uzi-toting man was shot to death Tuesday in Long Beach in what police 
believe was a drug transaction. An armed man shot the unidentified 25-year-old 
victim in the 6300 block of Long Beach Boulevard, police said. The victim 
attempted to raise his Uzi to firing position but was unable to when the weapon 
became entangled in his clothes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council acted a day after two local lawmakers, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), proposed 
making it a felony to sell, manufacture, import or possess semiautomatic 
weapons such as the AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi. Assemblyman Johan Klehs, 
(D-San Leandro), meanwhile, proposed boosting the two-year minimum prison 
sentence to life behind bars for a person convicted of assaulting anyone with a 
military-style rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statewide anti-weapons measures have received initial support, 
they are expected to face strong opposition from pro-gun advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the likely legislative battle in Sacramento, Yaroslavsky said a 
city ordinance could serve as a stopgap measure until the state acts. He said a 
state law would be preferable because a local ban could not stop a Los Angeles 
resident from buying a rifle in a nearby city. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky predicted that a local ban on such weapons might face legal 
hurdles, however. While confident that a ban on sales of semiautomatic weapons 
would fare well in the courts, he said an outright prohibition on possession of 
such guns may be vulnerable to a legal challenge. That is because state law 
would preempt any local ordinance on possession, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we approve such an ordinance locally, let someone sue us," Yaroslavsky 
said. "Let someone sue and say that the city of Los Angeles does not have the 
right to protect the public health and welfare of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He'll Take the Chance 
</P>
<P>
"Let the (U.S.) Supreme Court say to the second largest city in the United 
States that it does not have the right to ban the sale of weapons of war to its 
citizens," Yaroslavsky added. "I'm willing to take my chances." 
</P>
<P>
Kent DeChambeau, a Sacramento-based lobbyist for the 40,000-member California 
Rifle and Pistol Assn., said that any Los Angeles ordinance banning possession 
of semiautomatic weapons would be invalid on its face. He added, however, that 
it is not clear whether the city can outlaw the sale of such assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
DeChambeau branded as "headline grabbing" the Los Angeles City Council action 
and said the real battle should be conducted in the state capital, rather than 
in individual cities. Compton has also moved to ban the sale of semiautomatic 
weapons. DeChambeau added that the pro-gun group -- the California arm of the 
300,000-member National Rifle Assn. -- has not decided whether it will actively 
oppose the city's effort. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a local weapons ban has already attracted opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, a conservative Republican who until now has balked at 
most gun-control moves, said he has received letters threatening political 
retaliation if he supports a ban on semiautomatic weapons. Bernson said Tuesday 
that he nevertheless will vote to outlaw military-style rifles such as the 
AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time to 'Speak Out' 
</P>
<P>
"As one who has always supported the right of gun owners within reason, I feel 
the time has come to speak out," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the assault rifles "go way beyond" the type of weaponry favored by 
sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, a semiautomatic weapon is one that fires a round for each squeeze of 
the trigger. Automatic weapons, which fire continuously with one pull of the 
trigger, are already illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief David Dotson told reporters that when Chief Daryl F. 
Gates recently began speaking out against the sale and manufacture of 
military-style semiautomatic rifles, there also was some strong public 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them blistered the phone lines pretty good," Dotson said.

CAVALIERS HAVE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least Chuck Daly can say he saw it first. 
</P>
<P>
One disenchanting evening last summer, Detroit's head coach bolted awake in his 
bed and realized that he had been watching Cleveland play for the National 
Basketball Association championship on the playground of his subconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Daly finds little comfort in the knowledge that his dream was 
right on target. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a nightmare, that dream," Daly said last Monday. "They're for 
real; big time real. I think they're better than anybody in the league right 
now. They're a perfect extension of Lenny Wilkens (their coach) -- how he 
played and how he coaches. No flair, nothing spectacular, just solid, silent, 
assassin basketball, night in and night out. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see," Daly continued. "Golden State is going in there ... with, what, 
eight straight wins? Look out!" 
</P>
<P>
Look out, indeed. The Warriors left Richfield, Ohio, a befuddled 142-109 loser, 
their eight-game winning streak a memory and their brilliant coach, Don Nelson, 
a Cavalier convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings," Nelson said, "but Cleveland is far 
and away the best team that we've played." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavs have turned into a great team almost overnight, shooting to the top of 
a well-balanced league and leaving the established contenders to reexamine 
their own title chances. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to the Bullets Sunday, Cleveland's league-best record is 31-9. 
They are outscoring opponents by nearly 10 points a game. They won 11 straight 
by an average 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
And to think, just five seasons ago Cleveland was a laughingstock, a 
misbegotten franchise that exemplified all that was wrong with the league. 
Under the twisted reign of owner Ted Stepien, the "Cadavers" traded first-round 
draft choices as if they were baseball cards, missed the playoffs six straight 
times and couldn't attract 4,000 fans to home games. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the league intervened, and the Cavaliers were sold to George and 
Gordon Gund, Cleveland natives who own hockey's Minnesota North Stars. The 
Gunds purchased the Cavs on the condition that they'd receive four future No. 1 
draft picks to compensate for Stepien's indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
One pick was used to select Ron Harper, now Cleveland's leading scorer, in the 
1986 draft -- the same draft that brought center Brad Daugherty (at No. 1) and 
point guard Mark Price (in a draft-day trade). John Williams, chosen the year 
before despite his involvement in the Tulane point-shaving scandal, also became 
eligible around that time. 
</P>
<P>
So, Cleveland went into 1986-87 with four solid rookies, and no one doubted 
that the Cavaliers were a team of the future. It's just that no one expected 
them to mature so quickly. A year ago, the Lakers' Magic Johnson called them 
"The team of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Well, welcome to the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Embry was thinking ahead to the '90s when he became Cleveland's general 
manager two days after that 1986 draft. He needed a head coach to nurture all 
that young talent, and it didn't take him long to settle on Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else was available who had the experience or past success that Lenny 
had," said Embry, best remembered as the man who traded Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
from Milwaukee to the Los Angeles Lakers. "You had to respect anyone who had 
done what he's done as a coach and a player." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkens, an all-star point guard with four NBA teams, had already won more than 
500 games as a head coach. In 1969, at age 32, he became Seattle's 
player-coach, succeeding Al Bianchi. Later, he coached in Portland, departing 
the year before the Trail Blazers won the championship. In 1977-78, he took 
over a 5-17 Seattle team and took it to the finals. The next year, he led the 
Sonics to the title. 
</P>
<P>
His record aside, Wilkens had the ideal personality for a young team -- quiet 
and abiding, able to endure the growing pains of rookies while educating them 
on the game's nuances. And Wilkens quickly discovered that he had inherited the 
brightest bunch of players he'd ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you," Wilkens said, "as I got to know them as rookies, I'd sit around 
and we'd talk the game. We'd talk basketball, discussing situations and what 
we'd want to do, what to look for and how to look for it." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, his "quiet assassins" have become a youthful expression of 
Wilkens' patience, intelligence and guile. One reason they've emerged so 
quickly is that his youngest starters, Daugherty (23) and Price (24), are also 
his brightest players, and the offense flows through them. 
</P>
<P>
They're also his most gifted passers. Daugherty, in fact, is the best passing 
center in the game. "There aren't many smarter centers who've played the game," 
said Embry, who played with Bill Russell in Boston. "And I know there aren't 
many who have passed as well as he does." 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty has become adept at finding Price, an extraordinary outside shooter, 
coming off picks, and dishing off to Harper, Williams and Larry Nance. The top 
five scorers all shoot over 50 percent. Harper, Daugherty, Nance and Price all 
average between 18 and 20 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, everyone at this level is physically gifted," said Daugherty. "I don't 
want to finger any teams, but the difference between the good and bad teams is 
having people who are mentally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
That reflects on their stoic, cerebral coach and general manager who, it is 
worth noting, both happen to be black. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this team is finally learning to be a little calmer, more 
mild-mannered, just like Lenny," said backup Craig Ehlo, a reserve on the 
Houston team that lost to Boston in the 1986 finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny is a very smart man," said Tree Rollins, the Cavs' seldom-used, 
million-dollar center. "Like the team, he's intense, but it's sort of a subtle 
intensity. I think we have a subtle confidence about us." 
</P>
<P>
They certainly aren't a revival of Animal House. It would be hard to find a 
more restrained collection of young men. Daugherty's idea of fun is hunting 
snakes in the mountains of his native North Carolina. Price, who signed a 
five-year, $5 million contract before the season, is a Christian singer who 
donates one-tenth of his salary to a church. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, whose mother died when he was seven months old and whose father 
abandoned him soon after, reveres "Coach Lenny" as if he were the father he 
never knew. In Cleveland, they say if Wilkens asked Williams to shovel snow, 
Williams would do it with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to be consistent, and so far we've been able to do that," said 
Price. "We try not to get too caught up in things. But hey, we've definitely 
got some characters." And definitely, some character too. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly before last season's All-Star break that Embry decided that he 
was one major character short. Surveying his team, he realized that it lacked a 
forward who could run, score and, most important, play interior defense. 
Daugherty was not a gifted shot-blocker, and to become a superior defensive 
team, Cleveland needed another front-court defender. 
</P>
<P>
Embry needed Larry Nance. So, over three or four painstaking days last 
February, he sealed a deal that transformed the Cavaliers into a contender. He 
sent three backups -- center Mark West, forward Tyrone Corbin, and rookie point 
guard Kevin Johnson -- to Phoenix, getting Nance and Mike Sanders in return. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought Nance would also provide some veteran leadership for us," Embry 
said. "One thing you fear when you have a young team is the younger players 
coming together without influences other than themselves ... You hope one of 
them will emerge as a leader, but when they're all the same age, it's difficult 
for one to step to the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
Nance, who had seen good and bad times with Phoenix, including the regrettable 
drug scandal of 1987, saw it as "a new life." But upon his arrival, Cleveland 
lost 11 of 14, and people wondered about Nance, who began wondering himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be helping us win, and we were losing," said Nance. "That 
was the roughest time of my career, trying to handle why, because I felt I 
could fit in with any team. I felt we were losing because of me." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkens sat Nance down, telling him to relax and play his game. He also had a 
heart-to-heart with Williams, who had been a starter throughout his brief 
career. Wilkens asked Williams to become his sixth man, though he could remain 
a starter if he wished. 
</P>
<P>
"What Coach Lenny did was treat me like a man," Williams said. "And that's why 
I went to the bench to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who had been a 6-6 center at UCLA, took Williams' spot in the lineup, 
giving Cleveland a defensive stopper at the small forward. With the versatile 
Williams coming off the bench, Wilkens was now able to adjust his lineup for 
any circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers went 11-2 down the stretch. Although they lost to Chicago in the 
first round of the playoffs, they carried their regular-season momentum into 
this season. They went 8-0 in the preseason, and by mid-December had the 
league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
With Nance (the league's sixth-leading shot blocker) leading the way, the 
interior defense has been the primary reason. The Cavs have held 20 opponents 
under 100 points, and they lead the league in blocked shots per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Number one, we've got five guys willing to play defense," Wilkens said. "That 
allows us to double-team, to trap, and to pick up full-court when we have to. 
We're doing it more because guys understand where the help is coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland is also a trifle defensive about its unanticipated emergence. Like 
the New York Knicks, who host the Cavs Thursday, Cleveland prefers to downplay 
their sudden prominence and deflect any championship talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think those feelings are too prevalent now," Daugherty said. "You 
can't start to reach out and touch something you've never been close to before. 
I think the media is setting us up for a fall by creating all this hoopla and 
expectation. But we can't be concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
The league is getting concerned, though, because this young Cleveland team can 
only get better. For people like Chuck Daly, that's the greatest nightmare of 
all.

DERRICK KELLY WINS NABF WELTERWEIGHT TITLE AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derrick Kelly won a championship and Hector Lopez won the first bout of his 
comeback and TV announcer/boxer Ruben Castillo may have been knocked back 
behind the microphone when he lost a decision in another comeback bout at the 
Forum Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a Los Angeles welterweight who is 18-1 and ranked eighth in the world by 
the World Boxing Council, beat Luis Santana (38-8) on a 12-round unanimous 
decision to win the North American Boxing Federation welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez (18-1), who won an Olympic Games silver medal in Los Angeles in 1984 when 
he was a 17-year-old Glendale Hoover High junior, registered a 10-round 
unanimous decision over Rogelio Lopez (16-7). 
</P>
<P>
Hector Lopez was boxing for the first time in 7 months, having spent part of 
that time in jail on kidnap charges involving his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Through those 7 months, Lopez retained his No. 1 WBC featherweight ranking, but 
he looked a bit less than that Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hector was much the harder hitter against Rogelio, staggering his opponent 
several times. But he was unable to put him away. Or even down. Hector Lopez 
piled up a huge points lead with his quicker feet, leaping right hands, 
countering left hooks and left jabs for the first six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hector then appeared to have decided that he couldn't stop Rogelio, and 
switched to a movement strategy. Hector also seemed to run out of gas in the 
later rounds, and even he admitted he lacked sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the judges scored it 98-94, 98-92 and 99-91 for Hector. The Times 
card was 99-90. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired, and I wasn't sharp," he said. "I hurt my left hand -- the main 
knuckle -- in the sixth round, so I kind of backed off from slugging with him 
then," Hector said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogelio Lopez, while he came up short in punching power and quickness, may have 
won the courage award. Hector, until he gave up trying to knock out Rogelio, 
landed some thumping shots to Rogelio's head, particularly in the third and 
fourth rounds.

HARRIS' SPREE ENDS; CLEVELAND ROLLS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a game played at a snail's pace to put the brakes to Lucious Harris' 
hot streak. The Cleveland High forward was held to 10 points in a 45-42 North 
Valley League victory over Taft last week, ending a streak of 11 consecutive 
starts in which he had scored 20 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
Harris started the roll in mid-December with 29 points against Crossroads and 
continued the streak in the Las Vegas Holiday tournament in late December. 
Harris was named the tournament MVP and the Cavaliers won the 30-team 
tournament with a 5-game sweep. In the first game after returning home, Harris 
was ill and did not start in a nonconference game against Gardena, yet he came 
off the bench and scored 13 points in 1 1/2 quarters of play. 
</P>
<P>
Before the win over Taft, in which the Toreadors intentionally slowed the 
tempo, Harris averaged 28.4 points in 5 Northwest Valley Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
The senior started another streak with a 21-point performance in Friday's win 
over Kennedy. He is averaging 21.4 points and has scored in double figures in 
all 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Cleveland (17-2) extended its winning streak to 14 with an 82-42 
thrashing of Kennedy last Friday. The Cavaliers are averaging 85.4 points a 
game and allowing 59.8. They have scored more than 80 points in 13 of 19 games, 
90 or more in 7 games and 100 or more in 3 games. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood (12-4) has won 8 consecutive games and has a 10-1 record with 
Dana Jones in the lineup. The Huskies were 2-3 when the 6-6 junior center was 
sidelined by a sprained left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa has won its 10 league games by an average of 13.9 points. 
Interestingly, the Spartans' 2 closest games -- victories by 1 and 7 points -- 
were against Oxnard, which has lost 8 of 10 league games. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Newbury Park's leaders in 3-point shooting are Chris Falzone (22 of 
51, 43.1%), Wayne Cook (22 of 52, 42.3%) and Tim Lane (11 of 26, 42.3%). The 
rest of the Panthers have made only 14 of 61 for 23%. . . . Burroughs point 
guard Marnie Calderon has made 38 of 79 (41%) 3-point shots.

SALLIE BINGHAM STRIKES BACK;

THIS DAUGHTER OF A DYNASTY HAS PENNED AN EXCORIATING MEMOIR, ONE HER FAMILY 
VOCIFEROUSLY DISPUTES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was growing up on a secluded estate in Louisville, Sallie Bingham felt 
the presence of "this lurking something" in the Big House, the family name for 
the grim mansion on the Ohio River that housed her aristocratic tribe. 
</P>
<P>
When she went back last year for the funeral of her father, newspaper publisher 
Barry Bingham Sr., she felt it again, she said. "It's still there . . . the 
hovering presence of something unexplained that has malevolence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Blood Vendetta 
</P>
<P>
Leaning back in an easy chair, surrounded by the sophisticated rusticity of the 
farmhouse she shares with her third husband here, Bingham's dark memory clashes 
with the sunny winter day. Down the road in Louisville there are those -- most 
especially her mother, brother and sister -- who would argue that Sallie 
Bingham's recollection also clashes with reality and that she is bent on 
trashing her family name in a blood vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
At 52, Bingham -- a novelist, playwright and now a memoirist -- is the maverick 
of Kentucky's Bingham clan, until three years ago owners of the state's major 
newspapers, a television station, a radio station, a printing firm, a family 
with direct links to Presidents and influence far beyond the borders of their 
small state. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who writes, runs a foundation for women in the arts, and raises 
chickens and sheep on 400 acres of rolling, oak-spotted land often has been 
cast as the villain in the $434 million sell-off in 1986 of the Bingham media 
kingdom that included the influential, Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the 
Courier-Journal. After prolonged behind-the-scenes bickering with her brother, 
Barry Jr., Bingham chose to sell her 15% share of the companies, a decision 
that often has been portrayed as precipitating her father's decision to divest 
the family of its wellsprings of fame and fortune. It was the end of one of the 
last family-owned media dynasties in this country, a dynasty that exercised 
liberalism in a conservative state and made progressivism and rectitude its 
family credo. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie Bingham's share of the divestiture was $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
And that should have been that. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie Bingham did not retreat behind a wall of money. She just completed a 
book, "Passion and Prejudice," about her family, a book that is part memoir, 
part feminist tract and part angry retaliation against her mother, Mary, her 
brother, her dead father and her dead grandfather. For her, the book seems to 
be a necessary walk through the past to cast her own perspective on her family 
and her role in its sometimes fantastic story. 
</P>
<P>
The book proved "valuable for me . . . because it was me saying this is what I 
feel and I'm going to write it down. People will have different opinions about 
it, but I stand behind it, this is what I feel," Bingham said. 
</P>
<P>
"Passion and Prejudice" also is her attempt to come to terms with her father, 
whom she did not know well and who contributed, somehow, to the spirit of the 
Big House. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a shadowy presence all the time I was growing up, so that it's very 
hard to re-create that kind of person," she said. "I had to depend on what I 
could remember, which was very mystifying because, of course, he had this 
enormous charm that everybody responded to. . . . When I tried to go into 
detail, to say, who is this man, not only in relation to me but in relation to 
other people and in relation to the world, that strange vagueness kept coming 
in. Someone who is so charming, everyone loves, wonderful, good-looking, 
energetic. But who is he?" 
</P>
<P>
But what the 520-page volume seems most likely to do is rekindle public 
scrutiny of a family that has been the subject of two other recent books and 
will be the subject of at least one more. It has already triggered family and 
community scorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Passion and Prejudice" is a tale of a cloistered rich girl's woe. It details 
Bingham's childhood of servants and family secrets. It chronicles her 
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to escape from her family. It resurrects old 
scandals and hints at possible involvement by her father with the Central 
Intelligence Agency. It charges that the family masked private conservatism in 
matters of race and class behind a facade of public liberalism and benevolence. 
</P>
<P>
It laments a family that chattered constantly but never talked about its 
feelings toward one another. It recounts the bizarre deaths of her brothers 
Worth and Jonathan -- the first killed by a surfboard laid across the back of a 
convertible that snapped into the back of his head when it struck a parked car 
and the second electrocuted while splicing outdoor lights into a power line. It 
recounts other deaths, too, that form the tapestry of tragedy against which the 
Binghams won fame, wealth and power. It mourns the women who Bingham contends 
brought the family riches, strength and position but were always held back from 
power and glory by domineering, calculating men. It chronicles her own 
evolution from a sheltered childhood to becoming a writer, a feminist, an 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
The book's driving force is anger, Bingham said. "My anger goes way back to the 
feeling of being disprized as a child," she explained. "Any girl growing up in 
a dysfunctional family, I think, has a great deal of anger. In a sense, I never 
had parents and that's something I've come to terms with. But the anger that 
fueled the book is really 50 years of anger." 
</P>
<P>
Advance copies of the subjective family history, which will be published Friday 
by Alfred A. Knopf, already have caused a stir in Louisville where longtime 
Courier-Journal cartoonist Hugh Haynie 10 days ago compared "Passion and 
Prejudice" to Pinocchio, the children's character whose wooden nose grows 
longer each time he tells a lie. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Nolan, the Courier-Journal's managing editor who worked with Bingham when 
she was the newspaper's book page editor, said that the continuing controversy 
over the Bingham family is beginning to wear thin. "I think a whole lot of 
people are getting tired of the subject," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging Bingham 
</P>
<P>
After reading "Passion and Prejudice," Nolan said she "wondered if we (herself 
and Bingham) had been working in the same building." She challenged Bingham's 
version of her hiring as the Courier-Journal's book editor, saying that Bingham 
got the job because of family influence, and that the previous editor "was not 
removed because she was not doing a good job." Nolan, the first woman managing 
editor of a major metropolitan newspaper, also said she disagreed with Sallie's 
allegations that the Binghams had not done enough to hire and promote 
minorities and women at their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most notably, the family itself has issued a dossier disputing nearly 
every major point -- and many minor ones -- made by Bingham. The bound file 
containing nearly 300 separate points of dispute, supporting documents and a 
29-page summary has been sent to every major publication in the country that 
might review "Passion and Prejudice." In a cover letter signed by Mary, sister 
Eleanor, Barry Jr. and his wife Edith, the family declares, "For whatever 
reasons, Sallie's view of the family history is maliciously skewed. Her claims 
rest on unsupported assertions, erroneous suppositions, leaps of logic, and in 
some cases, outright fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sallie Bingham's dark suspicions about her family, the Binghams 
note elsewhere in the file that the book "seems less 'a family memoir' than a 
flight into fantasy supported by mystical conjectures and assertions that, more 
often than not, bear no relation whatever to fact." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a previous book that the Binghams challenged before publication, the 
cover letter also says, "We would like to make clear at the outset that we have 
in no way attempted nor will we attempt any type of restraint of publication of 
this book. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropped Publication 
</P>
<P>
In the previous instance, McMillan Publishing Co. dropped publication of David 
Chandler's "The Binghams of Louisville: The Dark History Behind One of 
America's Great Fortunes" after Barry Bingham Sr. rebutted the book's 
allegations with documents weighing a total of 8 pounds. Chandler's theory was 
that Judge Robert Worth Bingham founded the family fortune in 1917 when he 
"murdered his second wife for money." Mary Flagler Bingham, at the time the 
richest woman in America, bequeathed the judge $5 million. Chandler's book was 
later published by Crown. 
</P>
<P>
"Passion and Prejudice," for which Bingham said a second printing is already 
planned, has been chosen as an alternate selection of the Book-of-the-Month 
Club. Bingham herself will be traveling all over the country this month to 
publicize it. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview last Friday in the front room of her farmhouse, Sallie 
Bingham seemed more hurt by what she called the "vicious" and "devastating" 
broad strokes of the newspaper cartoon than by her family's counterattack, or 
by other critics who want to deal in fine details. She said she unsuccessfully 
has demanded a retraction of the cartoon and had written a letter to the editor 
protesting the drawing "that perfectly clearly implied that I was a liar and 
the book was nothing but lies." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, she seems unfazed by her family's ire, at least initially. When 
she learned of the dossier, "Well, frankly, I laughed," she said. "I thought, 
here they go again . . . and I thought how do they have the time and the 
energy. . . . And when you think of mailing that all over the country, every 
magazine, every newspaper. I asked them to let me see the list. I haven't seen 
it yet but that must be a formidable list. Why do that? Why not use the money 
another way? Why not give it to the homeless? Because this is not going to have 
the desired effect of making people doubt the book. People usually in my 
experience want to form their own opinions." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the interview though, Bingham's attitude of jaunty defiance toward her 
family cracked a bit. Asked if she would re-establish contact with her family, 
she said, "No, I really wouldn't want to see them. I've had a couple of very, 
very painful encounters which have reduced me to tears." A catch in her voice 
made her pause. "As you can see, it's causing me some feeling now," she 
continued, displaying the only flustered moment during a long interview. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she had talked to her publisher's lawyers and they had found in 
all, "one adjective in my book and part of one sentence that they felt needed 
to be changed for the next edition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs to Be Rewritten 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the family contends that most of the book needs to be 
rewritten. The document rebuts, with long lists of editorials published in the 
Courier-Journal, Bingham's charges that her family hid biases about race, sex 
and other social issues, and disputes that Barry Sr. had any ties with the 
American intelligence community. The brief -- which also alludes to the theory 
advanced by Chandler -- says that, among other things, Sallie got the cooling 
system in the Big House wrong, that it was not "metal fans suspended over pans 
of water" as she writes but actually "an ammonia compressor in the basement." 
More importantly, the family says medical tests prove that Judge Bingham "did 
not have syphilis as Sallie Bingham would have the reader believe." 
</P>
<P>
The family quotes medical testimony that the judge's wife, Mary Lily, was not 
poisoned, adding that the notion is an old, discredited contention that has 
been repeatedly raised over the decades, as well as by Chandler and by Sallie 
Bingham. (Members of the Bingham family declined to be interviewed personally, 
saying that their written response to the book is sufficient. However, in a 
statement issued through her attorneys, Mary Bingham said, "Our response to 
this work is an appeal to the conscience of institutions we respect and admire, 
and our purpose stems only from what we see as a responsibility to provide a 
true and accurate historical record of the Bingham family.") 
</P>
<P>
In its challenge to Bingham's book, the family says that the pattern of big and 
small errors "can only suggest the need for careful evaluation of the author's 
credibility and her lack of supporting documentation." "Passion and Prejudice" 
contains a bibliography but no footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alex S. Jones -- winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his 
reporting for the New York Times on the dissolution of the Bingham enterprises 
and now at work on a book about the subject with his wife, Time magazine 
associate editor Susan E. Tifft -- said in a telephone interview that "Passion 
and Prejudice" is "a fascinating blueprint to her (Sallie Bingham's) psyche but 
as history it is worthless." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation or Documentation? 
</P>
<P>
Based on his reading of "Passion and Prejudice," Jones said that Bingham seemed 
to have done little research and sometimes relied on her own speculation rather 
than documentation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Jones said that Bingham apparently did not check the voluminous 
documentation of the death of Judge Robert Bingham's first wife, Eleanor, 
killed in 1912 when the car in which she was riding was struck by a trolley. 
Others previously had been killed at the site where Eleanor died and the hazard 
of the crossing was a scandal of the time, Jones said, asserting that the death 
was clearly an accident. But Bingham, he said, plays up the potential for 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, at the conclusion of the section in which she wonders if Eleanor 
committed suicide by jumping on the tracks, Bingham writes, "It is only 
speculation. No one alive today can or will explain why Eleanor Miller Bingham 
vanished so completely." 
</P>
<P>
Bingham admitted that some of the issues she raises in the book are unproven. 
She said her speculation that her father had longstanding ties to U.S. 
intelligence is "an educated hunch and I try to express it as that." 
</P>
<P>
She explained: "As I tried to re-create him (her father) in my mind I couldn't 
explain certain things to myself. What was he doing in England in World War II? 
Was he really part of the D-Day invasion, because he told it so many different 
ways. What was he doing in Guam when mother was so desperate to have him home?. 
. . It is another book. There's not much here but it is another book. And I 
felt I owed it to myself to say there is a question. . . . I was fascinated to 
find out about six months ago that the woman who had been doing research with 
me in Washington said the Navy Department had no record that he had ever 
served. . . . That's the kind of thing that makes you wonder. It doesn't prove 
anything except that I think there's something unexplained about his career." 
</P>
<P>
Writing "Passion and Prejudice" was a cathartic experience that devoured "many 
sleepless nights," Bingham said. "Often I would just sit there and cry. . . . I 
would sit down and write a 'graph and think, 'Oh God, obviously I'm avoiding 
everything,' and start over. I had to admit how upset I was, how hurt I was." 
</P>
<P>
Her estrangement from her family dates back practically to her birth, Bingham 
said. She remembers a "beloved" governess telling her when she was 3 or 4 "that 
mother felt that I somehow didn't look like a Bingham. . . . I was so puzzled 
because we're all blonds, shall we say, Hitler's favorite color. So it wasn't 
that I suddenly had turned out to be black. I never did understand really what 
that meant but it gave me the feeling that somehow I was different." 
</P>
<P>
And in her circle, Bingham was different, she said, looking back at her youth 
from a secure middle age. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been such a relief to me to be 52, to like being 52, not to fuss about 
whether I've got wrinkles or I've got gray hair, or people think my teeth are 
ugly," she said. ". . . Looking back on it, remembering what it was like for 
young women that I knew in the '50s to be considered beauties, that was quite a 
sizable burden. You had to make your debut. You had to spend a lot of time 
going out to parties, talking about clothes. And I saved a lot of time and 
energy. I spent a lot of time and energy then learning how to be a writer." 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to Kentucky in 1977 after two failed marriages, Bingham said 
she had second thoughts almost immediately. "I remember my feelings of both 
pleasure and dismay when I would ride in the back seat of the car -- I was in 
my early 40s -- with my parents going to parties. I would think, 'My God, I 
didn't do this when I was 17. What am I doing? Why am I here?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continuity and Stability 
</P>
<P>
She stayed mainly because she wanted continuity and stability in the life of 
her sons, Bingham said, as well as remaining in the region that inspires her 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
And she intends to stay, Bingham said, no matter how tough the opposition 
becomes. "I am sure there are many committees (to run her out of town) but they 
won't succeed," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
As for her family, Bingham believes that writing the book gave her a valuable 
insight into other members' behavior. "Well, I understand their lack of free 
will," she said. "Here they apparently had everything, as so many people say. 
But what I think -- and I just speak now of them in a conglomerate because they 
all signed that cover letter -- they really ultimately lacked the ability to 
act as individuals and that's tragic." 
</P>
<P>
But Bingham said there are some things she may never understand, such as the 
deaths of her two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I take a leaf out of my mother-in-law's life. . . . She lost one of her sons 
at an early age to a brain tumor and she said it was the will of God," Bingham 
said. "Now that's a faith that I don't have but it's what I try to reach toward 
because I think it's really the only light at the end of the tunnel. . . . To 
us it seems such an unmitigated tragedy, for such young men particularly. But 
there was a reason for that, which we'll probably never know. That's what I try 
to hang on to." 
</P>
<P>
Then she added that occasionally she has a glimmer of an explanation as to why 
her brothers died. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes think that the suffering that both Worth and Jonathan were going 
through, or would have gone through in order to keep up the myth, would have 
made life intolerable for them. I feel so strongly that this myth is so cruel 
to the people that have to uphold it." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, too, she said, she has started going to church again. "I'm trying to 
find my way back. I need it," she said.

<P>
'WANDA'S' DARKHORSE CHARLES CRICHTON AMONG GUILD NOMINEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director Steven Spielberg, clad in his signature black leather jacket and 
baseball cap, couldn't help raising an eyebrow as he opened the envelope 
containing the names of the nominees for the prestigious Directors Guild of 
America award for best film direction Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"There are surprises," he said, breaking into a smile, "a couple of happy ones 
too." 
</P>
<P>
That was an understatement. In one of the most unexpected moves in its recent 
history, the 9,000-member Directors Guild included among its five nominees the 
78-year-old British director Charles Crichton for his work on "A Fish Called 
Wanda." 
</P>
<P>
Crichton, one of the seminal figures of Britain's Ealing Studios, won the 
guild's best film director award in 1952 for "The Lavender Hill Mob," but for 
the past 30 years he has worked mostly in British television. 
</P>
<P>
Despite "Wanda's" surprise box-office success, the film had been virtually 
ignored by the various groups that bestow awards in advance of the Oscar 
nominations. And most of the attention in reviews of the film was given to its 
star, John Cleese, the Monty Python veteran who wrote the script for "Wanda." 
</P>
<P>
The other nominees for the guild's feature direction award, which will be 
announced at a dinner March 11, were more predictable: Alan Parker for 
"Mississippi Burning," Barry Levinson for "Rain Main," Robert Zemeckis for "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit" and Mike Nichols for "Working Girl." Parker was nominated 
in 1978 for "Midnight Express," and Nichols has been tapped twice by the guild: 
He was nominated in 1966 for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and he received 
the guild's award the following year for "The Graduate." 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" and "Working Girl" received best picture awards at the Golden Globes 
Saturday night. "Mississippi Burning" received the National Board of Review 
awards for best picture and best director. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising omission from the nomination list was Clint Eastwood, who received 
widespread critical acclaim for "Bird," a film based on the life of jazzman 
Charlie Parker. Just two days before, Eastwood had won a Golden Globe award for 
"Bird" from the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleasantly surprised with Wanda," Spielberg said during the short press 
conference. "But I also had my fingers crossed behind my back that Eastwood 
would be nominated. I thought 'Bird' was an outstanding directorial 
accomplishment, an outstanding movie." 
</P>
<P>
Other notable omissions include Lawrence Kasdan, who directed "Accidental 
Tourist," which won the New York film critics' top film award; Stephen Frears 
for "Dangerous Liaisons"; Sidney Lumet for "Running on Empty"; and Philip 
Kaufman, who won a best director award from the National Society of Film 
Critics for "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." 
</P>
<P>
After announcing the awards, Spielberg also confessed that he was a little 
surprised -- and very pleased -- by the inclusion of his protege, Zemeckis, in 
the list. Zemeckis directed "Back to the Future" for Spielberg, and Spielberg 
was an executive producer on "Roger Rabbit." "I'm very happy for Bob," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Directors Guild award for outstanding directorial achievement is a 
bellwether for the Academy Awards. Only three times during the guild's 40-year 
history of bestowing its award have winners not gone on to win the Academy 
Award as well. 
</P>
<P>
One of those exceptions involved Spielberg, a six-time guild nominee. Spielberg 
became the only director to win the guild's award and not receive an Oscar 
nomination when his work on "The Color Purple" was overlooked by the director's 
branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It blunts the blow when you've been recognized by one voting group," Spielberg 
said in a brief interview after the announcement. "Every (Directors Guild) 
nomination has been the biggest thrill." 
</P>
<P>
The other exceptions were Francis Coppola, who won the directors' award for 
"The Godfather" in 1972 and lost out to Bob Fosse ("Cabaret") for the Oscar, 
and Anthony Harvey, the 1968 guild winner for "The Lion in Winter," who lost to 
Carol Reed ("Oliver") in the Academy voting. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bernardo Bertolucci won the guild's award for "The Last Emperor" 
before going on to win an Oscar. Oliver Stone won both awards the previous year 
for "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
Crichton's 1946 "Hue and Cry" was the first of a series of comedies that helped 
Ealing Studios define British humor for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Before teaming up with Cleese on "Wanda," Crichton made documentaries for 
Cleese's industrial training film company, Video Art. In "Wanda," Crichton and 
Cleese developed a madcap crime comedy not unlike Crichton's "The Lavender Hill 
Mob." This time, though, they used the plot as a vehicle to highlight the 
cultural differences between Americans and Britons. 
</P>
<P>
"Wanda" received rave reviews when it was first released here last summer. But 
even its distributor, MGM/UA, didn't expect the film to be a box-office hit. So 
far, the film has grossed more than $60 million in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the members of the Directors Guild are directors of feature 
films or of TV shows, movies and commercials. The other members work in the 
industry in such capacities as production and technical coordinators. Members 
of all branches of the guild vote to nominate for best feature film direction. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the guild will announce nominations for its TV director awards.

ROBERT HILBURN: AMERICAN 'MICHAEL' AWARDS: MORE ADVERTISING THAN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was fitting that Diet Coke launched its high-powered George Michael ad 
campaign on the American Music Awards telecast. 
</P>
<P>
The annual pop special itself is simply one long -- very l-o-n-g -- commercial. 
</P>
<P>
When pop stars (including Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) weren't seen hawking 
beer in conventional commercials during Monday's three-hour event, they were on 
stage hyping themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike next month's Grammy Awards ceremony, where the emphasis is on artistic 
achievement, the American Music Awards is simply an excuse for a television 
program. No sin in that, but it does make performers look a bit silly when they 
shed tears and repeatedly thank God for their trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The "awards" are based on results of a national popularity poll conducted among 
approximately 20,000 music fans -- which helps explain how Whitney Houston 
could defeat Tracy Chapman for recordings in 1988 and how the "Dirty Dancing" 
sound track could defeat anything. 
</P>
<P>
If Dick Clark Productions gave out the pyramid-shaped trophies at a private 
dinner, they would be lucky to have enough stars on hand to generate one good 
trade publication publicity photo. 
</P>
<P>
Because the awards are handed out on prime-time television, however, artists 
scurry for seats. The lure: 60 seconds or so for the winners at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
If that exposure isn't enticing enough, superstars can look forward to special 
awards and -- crucially -- extra time. 
</P>
<P>
Two special awards and 16 minutes of exposure were enough to lure the normally 
reclusive Michael Jackson to the Shrine Auditorium stage, where another 
superstar, comedian Eddie Murphy, obediently narrated a gushing 
mini-documentary of Jackson's recent "Bad" tour. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Jackson had to fight to get the 16 minutes and the awards. The 
show's producers would have given him 26 minutes because it's a coup having 
Jackson involved at all. 
</P>
<P>
Even Murphy, whose persona is based on his ultra-confident manner, seemed 
intimidated by Jackson's transcendent fame. 
</P>
<P>
When the pop star stepped to the microphone to accept the awards, he discovered 
the stand was too low. After trying to bend over awkwardly to reach the 
microphone, the unnerved Jackson stepped back and asked Murphy to adjust the 
stand for him. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy moved forward like an eager stage hand before remembering that he, too, 
is a star and that it wasn't his job to fix the microphone stand. 
</P>
<P>
In Murphy's only spontaneous -- and funny -- remark, he quipped, "(Michael) 
said, 'Eddie pull it up,' like I was working for him . . . and I started to do 
it, too, 'Yes Michael.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Willie Nelson also received a special award (and 9 minutes of TV time), 
the evening's co-star was the other Michael -- George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Jackson's 16-minute salute served in the end to further enhance the 
status of his pop rival from Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed Diet Coke commercial didn't have much fizz: scenes of a 
matador preparing for battle juxtaposed against scenes of pop star Michael 
getting ready to face his fans on stage. 
</P>
<P>
But the English pop star's victories in three American Music Awards categories 
(most popular R&amp;B album, male R&amp;B singer and male pop/rock singer) did 
leave their mark. 
</P>
<P>
Because Michael Jackson was also nominated in the two latter categories, the 
message for millions of viewers was that George Michael -- despite all the 
excitement of the 16 minutes of "Bad" tour footage" -- was the more popular 
record-maker in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Equally impressive was the graceful way the young Englishman handled himself at 
the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Though his "Faith" album has sold more than 6 million copies in the United 
States alone, Michael is still struggling to win credibility as an artist -- a 
goal made more difficult by his former membership in the lightweight British 
pop duo Wham! 
</P>
<P>
Michael may be reading more into the awards than the voting decrees, but there 
was a disarming sense of genuine humility in his remarks each time he accepted 
an award. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to say that a couple of years back when I split the (duo), I 
knew I had a tough job ahead of me . . . and I thought that maybe people 
weren't going to give me much of a chance," he said in his final visit to the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I'd just like to thank everybody . . . for giving me that chance and 
letting me prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
If the head-to-head competition between the two Michaels produced a true moment 
of drama in an evening of unabashed self-promotion, most of the telecast was as 
flat as the Diet Coke spot. 
</P>
<P>
With the array of stars on stage (from country's Randy Travis to rap's D.J. 
Jazzy Jeff), one certainly got a look at the range of commercial pop music 
these days. But it was surface rather than substance. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Guns N' Roses' defiant rendition of "Patience," the live 
performances (ranging from Rick Astley and Sade to the Miami Sound Machine and 
K.T. Oslin) were uneventful, and the evening's co-hosts (Kenny Rogers, Anita 
Baker, Rod Stewart and Debbie Gibson) were uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next year the producers ought to acknowledge the program's TV-show 
foundation and invite Oprah, Phil and Geraldo to co-host. That'd probably boost 
ratings -- and those three certainly know the realities of television 
self-promotion.

BARENBOIM CONFIRMED FOR CHICAGO PODIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Barenboim, the 46-year-old conductor/pianist fired from Opera de la 
Bastille in Paris two weeks ago, has been named the next music director of the 
Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Barenboim, who will immediately assume the title of 
music director designate, takes up the directorship for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Georg Solti, the highly acclaimed music director of the Chicago Symphony 
for the past 20 seasons, will become music director laureate. Solti, 76, told 
orchestra officials in 1986 that he wished to step down after the orchestra's 
1990-91 centennial season, according to the orchestra's announcement. Barenboim 
almost immediately became the rumored front-runner for the position, but 
official announcement of it was delayed because of Solti's desire not to spend 
too many years as a lame-duck director with a publicly named successor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most difficult decision of my life . . . I was in tears," Solti 
said Monday at a press conference in Chicago. "Still, it is the only right 
thing to do. You must not stay too long." 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim is no stranger to the Chicago Symphony. He first conducted it in 
1970, and has made more than 30 recordings with the orchestra, including the 
Bruckner and Schumann symphony cycles. He comes to the CSO from 13 years as 
music director of L'Orchestre de Paris, another position where he succeeded 
Solti. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known him (Barenboim) and have been closely involved in his development 
as a conductor for many years, and he is my first choice," Solti said in the 
Chicago announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Solti has also supported Barenboim in his dispute with Pierre Berge, who fired 
the conductor from the new Opera Bastille, scheduled to open on the 200th 
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. Solti was one of the 
world-class musicians signing a petition to Culture Minister Jack Lang, 
suggesting they might cancel their performances with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues in the affair are Berge's charges that Barenboim was paid too 
much, and was turning opera-for-Everyman into a high-priced, elitist endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor may become open to similar controversy in Chicago. According to 
published reports of his response to the appointment, Barenboim said: "If it 
doesn't sound too arrogant, I really would like to take culture out of the 
entertainment world in Chicago. It has all the conditions for being a great 
cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim's Paris wages were $1.1 million. Chicago officials have declined to 
specify what he will earn on his three-year contract.

AFTER 19 YEARS, MAKAROVA RETURNS TO KIROV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Natalia Makarova is like an atom. She is tiny, but as powerful as a nuclear 
reactor. And the night before her historic performance here with the Kirov 
Ballet, the 49-year-old never-say-die prima ballerina was a walking, talking, 
chain-smoking time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
How does it feel to be invited back to dance at Kirov Theater almost 19 years 
after her defection in 1970? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will collapse soon," she replied without humor. 
</P>
<P>
For nine days now, Makarova, a longtime resident of San Francisco, has been 
swimming in a riptide of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since she left that she has seen her mother, stepfather 
and stepbrother. It is the first time she has seen her old friends. It is the 
first time she has stepped back onto the soil of her homeland, never mind the 
stage of the Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
And she is doing all of this ("looking at my place at the barre where I used to 
do exercises, seeing all my old friends and remembering funny things, crying -- 
everyone who sees me cries, and I cry too,") under the intense scrutiny of both 
the Soviet and Western press. 
</P>
<P>
Makarova is the first defecting Soviet artist to accept an invitation to 
perform in her motherland. And as such she stands as a symbol of changing 
attitudes in the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
In between the non-stop phone conversations with friends and family, the dinner 
parties, the never-ending press interviews and rehearsing with the Kirov, she 
has managed only three hours of sleep a night, her American husband, 
businessman Edward Karkar, pointed out. And this in itself is a wonder 
considering she was also participating in Leningrad's first international film 
festival, where two days ago she translated a screening of the 1987 BBC series 
"Ballerina" that she wrote and hosted. 
</P>
<P>
Her invitation to participate in the film festival was the original reason she 
came to Leningrad. The Kirov invitation was arranged by the theater on the 
heels of the announcement that she was coming back to the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
And so Wednesday, the bone-tired ballerina, who since her defection has danced 
most frequently with the American Ballet Theatre and London's Royal Ballet, 
will step on to the Kirov theater stage to dance in one of the most emotional 
performances of her life, before a Makarova-mad audience. 
</P>
<P>
How does she feel about her upcoming performance under these circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to think about it" she said, poking at the cold Chicken Kiev on her 
plate, brought up to her two story suite of rooms at Leningrad's Pribaltiyskaya 
Hotel, despite the fact that Soviet hotels, as a rule, do not provide room 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been so tense all this week. I've had no break. But I will take time to 
concentrate on it later," she said about Wednesday's performance that will be 
filmed by the BBC for a documentary it is producing on the Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
Makarova will dance two pas de deux with French dancer Alexander Sombart from 
John Cranko's ballet "Onegin." 
</P>
<P>
Though Makarova chose it, she said, because it is a Russian story and one of 
her favorite ballets, it is an ironic, if not symbolic, choice. In the ballet 
her character, Tatiana, is rejected by the man she loves, only to have him 
change his mind many years later. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the rejection by the Soviet Union after Makarova defected was 
profound, despite her protests that she did it on a whim: "I was bored, I 
wanted to explore the world," she said, declining to discuss the politics of 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
It was only last year, "after a long period of oblivion in her home country," 
according to the official Soviet news agency Tass, that Makarova's name was 
again included in the authoritative Soviet reference book "Leningrad Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would compare defecting to betraying the country," explained the 
Kirov ballet's chief choreographer and artistic director Oleg Vinogradov. 
"There are not many to support these new changes," lamented the politically 
outspoken former dancer who was the driving force behind Makarova's comeback. 
But, Vinogradov added positively, that he considers the fact that the 
government has allowed Makarova to return as a symbol of "the humanizing of all 
processes and policy in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
"We are striving for an ideal that no one would want to leave our country, and 
on the contrary all those who left would like to come back," said the acclaimed 
choreographer whose newest work, "Petrushka," will premiere March 21 in 
Glasgow, Scotland, and whose first dance piece was choreographed expressly for 
Makarova when the two were in ballet school. 
</P>
<P>
While an invitation to return to Leningrad to perform with the Kirov has been 
in the works since Makarova danced with the company on its tour in London last 
August, the permission was granted suddenly. "I was phoned by the Soviet 
ambassador to London (where Makarova maintains an apartment) on Jan. 20, and on 
Jan. 22 I was here," she says, reflecting on the whirlwind of days behind her 
now.

TOWER SAYS HE'S NO DRINKER AND IS A 'MAN OF DISCIPLINE'; 
</P>
<P>
HE ANSWERS HIS CRITICS PUBLICLY

<P>
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, given a chance today to answer his 
critics in public, denied to senators that he has a drinking problem and 
described himself as "a man of some discipline." 
</P>
<P>
In a fourth day of public and private testimony to the Senate Armed Services 
Committee he once headed, Tower was asked directly by Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
to describe his view of alcohol and whether he had a drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I have none. I am a man of some discipline," the former senator replied. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich, the chairman of Coalitions for America, 
told the committee Tuesday that he had seen Tower drunk "on numerous occasions" 
in the past and also in the company of women to whom he was not married. 
Senators later said that behind closed doors Weyrich could not offer the 
specifics to make his allegations anything more than "hearsay." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Zero Tolerance' Policy 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee in response to a question about his attitude toward 
women that as defense secretary he would have a "zero tolerance" policy for 
sexual harassment in the armed forces. He also mentioned that he does not want 
to see military women in combat. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding alcohol, Tower said, "I think it is essential that the secretary of 
defense be at all times capable of exercising the duties and responsibilities 
of the office, some of which are more sensitive and critical than the general 
public realizes. And therefore I think there should be zero toleration of 
anyone . . . who has an alcohol problem." 
</P>
<P>
Tower was able to answer his critics publicly after a nearly two-hour closed 
session with the committee this morning. In the open forum, he responded to 
what were likely to be a final round of questions, including queries about 
potential conflicts of interest. He pledged in the wake of his recent defense 
consulting work to avoid even the perception of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn punched his own hole in another Weyrich allegation -- that President 
Bush's transition team had received letters with specific allegations about 
Tower's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reports Checked by FBI 
</P>
<P>
Nunn produced a letter from White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that said no 
letters could be found with specific claims of misbehavior by Tower. It also 
said every allegation heard about Tower was given to the FBI for checking. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of when the committee would vote on Tower's 
nomination. Nunn cautiously declined comment about whether the nomination was 
in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower controversy began when Weyrich, one of three people testifying 
Tuesday against him, challenged his "moral character" in open session. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition, 
a lack of sobriety, as well as with women to whom he was not married," Weyrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I encountered him frequently enough to the point that it made an impression," 
said Weyrich, who worked as a staff member in the Senate when Tower was a 
senator. "I did encounter this on a number of occasions."

Federal investigators concluded today that a pilot's use of cocaine contributed 
to the crash a year ago of a Colorado commuter plane that killed nine people, 
including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said cocaine use by pilot Stephen 
Silver, 36, led to his ineffectively monitoring the aircraft's descent into 
Durango. Co-pilot Ralph D. Harvey, 42, who was also killed, was controlling the 
plane at the time. Board investigators said it is the first time that cocaine 
use by a pilot of a commercial aircraft has been blamed for a crash.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today offered to withdraw Israeli troops from 
some cities in the occupied territories if Palestinians accept autonomy as a 
step toward solving the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
It was Shamir's most conciliatory statement yet on Israel's future role in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip but was quickly rejected by the PLO on the grounds it 
is just a retread of the Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
"I advise Mr. Shamir to stop digging into his old stock and bringing out these 
goods which are out of date. . . . No Palestinians or Arabs will speak to him 
on this basis," PLO spokesman Ahmgd Abderrahman said in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining his plan, Shamir told reporters: "At a certain stage, when there is 
autonomy, the army will leave several urban centers and be focused in some 
other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir pointed out that a troop redeployment was called for in the 
U.S.-brokered Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 accords call for electing local Palestinian representatives to hold 
peace talks with Israel, along with representatives of Egypt and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
There would then be a five-year period of autonomy, followed by further 
negotiations on the final status of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO and many Palestinians in the territories occupied in the 1967 Middle 
East War reject the Camp David accords and the concept of autonomy, maintaining 
these ideas are intended to circumvent the PLO and contradict Palestinian 
demands for an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said the most crucial step in the peace process is to begin 
negotiations. "Once we get to this stage, positive results will come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that Israel will not speak to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and will not accept an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir outlined his views as paralleling the Camp David accords, which led to 
Israel's peace treaty with Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"The peace process will be comprised of two stages," he said. "First an interim 
condition and this will include full autonomy. In the second stage (there will 
be) direct negotiations without preconditions between Israel, Palestinian Arabs 
and Arab countries." 
</P>
<P>
During a speech earlier to rabbis from the Israel Bonds organization, Shamir 
lambasted PLO leader Yasser Arafat and called recent international recognition 
of the Palestinian group "the bizarre Arafat festival." 
</P>
<P>
"The object of the massive PLO disinformation campaign was to persuade an 
ignorant and naive world that in fact they have legitimate national rights in 
our land and that they are the paragons of peace in this area. Nothing is 
further from the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO won significant diplomatic gains, including the end of a 13-year U.S. 
ban on talks with the group, after Arafat in December recognized Israel and 
renounced terrorism.

In the latest development in a decade-old controversy, the Environmental 
Protection Agency today proposed a ban on a popular chemical used to make 
apples appear more appealing and to increase shelf life, citing "an inescapable 
and direct" link to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, however, stopped short of ordering the chemical, which is marketed 
under the trade name Alar, immediately off the market because it said it does 
not consider the health risk severe enough for such action. The rule review 
process could take 18 months, it said.

CHILL DIPS TO MINUS 80, NORTH ROCKIES TO PLAINS

A frigid mass of supercold Alaskan air whipped by high winds plunged wind 
chills down to a dangerous 80 degrees below zero in the northern Rockies and 
Plains today, brought rare snowfall to Seattle and spread winter's "big chill" 
as far south as Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst of the winter but we knew it was coming down from Alaska so 
we are ready," said Virginia Hull of Williams, Minn. "It was 31 below this 
morning and we're expecting wind chills of 50 to 60 below this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Russell, Kan., tumbled 72 degrees from 84 on Tuesday to 12 
degrees today. Valentine, Neb., plunged from 70 to zero in 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like somebody opened the refrigerator door," said Jerry Maul, a 
service station manager in Lincoln, Neb., where the temperature went from 72 
degrees Tuesday to 10 today. 
</P>
<P>
High winds whipped light snow and drifts into ground blizzards and sent wind 
chills to 80 below at Minot, N.D., 75 below at Cut Bank, Mont., 66 below at 
Williston, N.D., and 65 below at Jamestown, N.D., and Butte, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Wind chill advisories also were in effect for Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and 
Nebraska as the cold wave pushed across the Mississippi Valley and the Plains 
as far south as Oklahoma, where the temperature fell from 80 degrees on Tuesday 
to 20 by today. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Warnings Issued 
</P>
<P>
Light snow fell over parts of the northern Plains and northern Rockies, and 
winter weather and storm warnings were issued from Washington to Minnesota. Up 
to 6 inches fell in parts of Washington, with lesser amounts in Montana, Idaho 
and North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Snow even dusted Oregon's northern beaches, which usually are rain-swept at 
this time of year. "This is like sprinkling sawdust on cake," said John Mert, 
34, of Cannon Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's temperature dropped to 20 degrees and Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport closed at 6:30 a.m. today until snow-slick runways could be cleaned. 
Howling winds on Puget Sound halted ferry runs to the San Juan Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusting to 70 m.p.h. slammed into the Reno-Carson City, Nev., area this 
morning, knocking out a transformer and power for about 4,000 residents north 
of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The winds set off burglar alarms at businesses in Reno and prompted the Nevada 
Highway Patrol to close a section of U.S. 395 between Reno and Carson City to 
campers and trailers.

The "red tide," poisonous algae from the Gulf of Mexico, killed hundreds of 
bottlenose dolphins along the Atlantic Seaboard in 1987 and 1988, scientists 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The algae were carried by small fish, menhaden or Spanish mackerel, that were 
eaten by the dolphins, weakening the mammals' cardiovascular and immune 
systems, according to Dr. Joseph Geraci, a veterinarian and professor of 
wildlife diseases at the University of Guelph in Canada. Geraci led a team of 
more than 100 scientists, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, in an 18-month study of the dolphin deaths.

NORTH JUDGE WEIGHS ACTION AGAINST ABC;

ASSAILS AIRING OF TESTIMONY, HINT ON ELUDING JURY DUTY

The federal judge overseeing the Iran-Contra case said today he is considering 
a contempt action against ABC News for a report about the start of Oliver L. 
North's trial that used his immunized testimony. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell noted the network's Tuesday evening news 
broadcast carried a portion of North's 1987 testimony to Congress about the 
foreign policy affair. ABC reporter Tim O'Brien said in his report that anyone 
seeing that testimony would be excused as a juror. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said O'Brien "took pains to advise the public that if they looked at 
(his report with North's testimony), they'd be excused from jury service." 
</P>
<P>
"I have not decided whether or not this is the appropriate basis for a contempt 
action," the judge said sternly, and he told prosecution and defense lawyers to 
question potential jurors intensely about their recall of North's appearance 
before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell is dismissing as a juror anyone who acknowledges reading about, watching 
or listening to North's testimony to Congress about the 1985-86 U.S. arms sales 
to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Broadcast 
</P>
<P>
George Watson, ABC's Washington bureau chief, defended the broadcast, saying, 
"I don't see how we can report on issues before the court without going back to 
the public record of what Colonel North has said on the subject himself." 
</P>
<P>
"If that causes a problem for jurors, that must be addressed by Judge Gesell 
himself," Watson said. "We are very mindful of the rights of Colonel North or 
any defendant to a fair trial, but we have a responsibility . . . to report 
what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
North, 45, faces 12 felony charges, including lying to Congress, destroying 
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. If convicted on all charges, the 
former White House aide and retired Marine lieutenant colonel faces 60 years in 
prison and $3 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection resumed today with another 52 potential panelists asked to 
complete a questionnaire about their knowledge of North's case. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven people have been selected so far for the final jury pool, a group of 
about 50 people from which the ultimate panel of 12 jurors and six alternates 
will be selected.

An unwed couple expecting their third child "are creating children for the 
welfare rolls," a federal judge said in blocking their request to overturn an 
agency's ban on housing unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux also suggested that Dana Dagnese leave 
the family so that Susan Arsenau and the children could meet the housing 
authority's regulation, said Steven Brown of the American Civil Liberties 
Union's Rhode Island chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who have lived together six years, filed a federal lawsuit two 
weeks ago saying the authority's decision to deny them emergency housing 
violated their rights to "freedom of association, family privacy and equal 
protection of laws." The couple were seeking a preliminary injunction Tuesday. 
No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a couple in an illicit relationship, who are creating children for the 
welfare rolls, while others who qualify for housing are shunted aside," the 
judge said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't the court look silly asking the authority to foster these people and 
allow them to continue an illegal relationship?" 
</P>
<P>
Dagnese, who has been separated from his wife for almost a decade, is awaiting 
completion of his divorce, Brown said. He and Arsenau have a 3-year-old 
daughter and a year-old son and are expecting a child in March.

Southbound motorists on the San Diego Freeway in Huntington Beach hit a real 
gusher Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was that the gusher hit them. 
</P>
<P>
They were cruising along about 2 p.m., enjoying warm, clear weather, when a 
spout of water suddenly arched onto the freeway, catching the first wave of 
drivers unaware and drenching their cars. The hundreds behind them swerved to a 
standstill, then slowly resumed their progress, edging toward the center 
divider to avoid the spray cascading into lanes 2, 3 and 4 of Interstate 405. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected incident developed when an expansion joint on a 21-inch water 
line broke at the Newland Street overpass, authorities said. Some of the water 
poured into a flood-control canal, but the rest arched onto the freeway and 
spilled across all four southbound lanes, according to a California Highway 
Patrol dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The broken water main was carrying water from the Orange County Metropolitan 
Water District to the Huntington Beach Water District, officials said. Jeff 
Renna, superintendent of the Huntington Beach Public Works Department, said the 
pipe was put in about 1955, and the rubber part of the expansion joint could 
have just worn out. 
</P>
<P>
District employees shut off the gushing water after about 30 minutes. Repairs 
should be completed by Thursday, authorities said, and no one in the city was 
expected to be without water because of the break.

FREEWAY SNARLED AFTER CORVETTE, BIG RIG COLLIDE

<P>
A Huntington Beach man was injured and morning traffic on the southbound San 
Diego Freeway was stymied for 2 hours Friday after a tractor-trailer rig and a 
car collided in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The 5:45 a.m. crash forced police to close all but the slow lane and a car-pool 
lane that is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Bill Jacques said a Camaro sideswiped the 
rear of the truck as it entered the freeway from the San Gabriel River Freeway. 
The 65-foot truck swerved across three lanes and collided with a Corvette, 
which was crushed beneath the big rig's front end and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette driver, Gary Hedge, 27, of Huntington Beach, escaped the fire but 
suffered a 6-inch gash on his head that required 30 stitches. The truck driver, 
Charles Loquet, 60, of La Puente, doused the flames with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
Several other minor accidents then occurred on the northbound and southbound 
sides of the freeway because of sudden stops from rubbernecking, CHP Officer 
Leslie Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The Camaro's driver left the scene and has not been identified.

A 13-year-old girl was killed Tuesday afternoon after the car in which she was 
riding turned left in front of a pickup truck and was struck broadside, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger in the car, a 19-year-old Anaheim man, was in very critical 
condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard 
said. The names of both the girl and the man were being withheld until their 
families could be notified.

The driver of the Camaro, Hermilo Sanchez, 18 of Anaheim, and the driver of the 
pickup, Darren Renison, 19, of Anaheim, were taken to Placentia-Linda Community 
Hospital in Placentia, police said. Both were treated for minor injuries and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the Camaro was westbound on Miraloma Avenue at 2:45 p.m. 
when it turned left in front of the pickup at Red Gum Street. The pickup 
swerved to avoid the Camaro but slammed into the car's side, investigators 
said. 
</P>

The accident remains under investigation.

<P>
A construction crew rebuilding a Laguna Beach hotel accidentally broke a sewer 
line on Tuesday, causing thousands of gallons of raw sewage to flood into the 
ocean north of Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The north portion of Main Beach was closed after the 9:30 a.m. pipeline rupture 
and will remain closed for at least a day, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the construction crew was working on the renovation of the Inn of 
Laguna on North Coast Highway when it hit the line. He said it took until about 
1 p.m. to stop the flow of sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was considerably smaller than one last May on the same beach. Then, a 
1-mile stretch of shoreline from Main Beach to Cleo Street was closed for 2 
days after 1 million gallons of raw sewage spewed into the ocean when a pump 
station was knocked out by an electrical failure. That spill was one of the 
largest in county history.

Neuman, 42, has coordinated UCI's $350-million expansion, a project expected to 
add more than 20 major complexes to the campus by 1992. The new buildings, 
which contrast with the modernistic concrete boxes that formed the early 
nucleus of the campus, include the Italianate-style Alumni House, the Cubist 
Student Services Building and the Pop-Modernist Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
As university architect at Stanford, Neuman will oversee design of campus 
buildings, including a plan to add more than 2 million square feet of space 
over the next decade.

PIONEER OILMAN, RANCHER DIES AT 92; 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE G. KEY WAS ONE OF LAST ORANGE GROWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Placentia native George Gilman Key, who was one of the last orange growers in 
the county, died Monday night at St. Jude Hospital, relatives said Tuesday. He 
was 92 and had been hospitalized for more than a week with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Key was born in 1896 on a ranch that was owned by the Southern California 
Semi-Tropical Fruit Co., where his father, George Benn Key, worked as its first 
superintendent. In 1898, his father built the family home, which is part of the 
historic George Key Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Key moved to the Torrance and Lomita area in 1923 after serving in the Merchant 
Marine. He supervised oil drilling and production in Atwood, Huntington Beach, 
Long Beach and Signal Hill for several oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring in 1945, Key and his wife, Hannah, moved back to the family's 
20-acre ranch, which had been divided among family members. Soon afterward, he 
bought out his brother and six sisters, becoming sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
After the decline of the citrus industry in the 1960s, Key sold most of the 
property, saving 2.2 acres for himself and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He held out longer than any other grower in the area," said Linda Lorenzi, who 
has been the park ranger at the ranch for 4 years. She added that Key collected 
some of the antique farm equipment now on display at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Key sold the ranch to the county for $325,000 on the condition that he 
and his wife could live there for the rest of their lives. Hannah Key died in 
1983 after more than 60 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Key also donated his collection of artifacts, which is on display in two sheds 
and in the 3,800-square-foot, post-Victorian-style house. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a wonderful person," Lorenzi said. "He had an incredible knowledge of 
history. He wrote a book (titled "Early Placentia") that we had published for 
him for his 90th birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his interest in the ranch, Key was heavily involved in the community. 
He volunteered many hours with the local Boy Scouts and the YMCA, and was an 
elder of the Placentia Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
He had been honored many times by Placentia and the county, including the 
naming of a school for retarded children after him in 1979. He was made 
honorary mayor of Placentia in 1977, and received an award of merit from the 
Orange County Historical Society in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great father and very generous," his son, George Jr., said Tuesday. "He 
could do a varity of things. He liked new challenges, and he liked people. Even 
up to the last day he was smiling and talking with his family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
Key, who outlived his brother and sisters, said in a 1984 interview, "I tell 
'em I'm the only apple left hanging on the tree and I'm . . . ready to fall." 
</P>
<P>
A private graveside ceremony will be conducted Saturday at Loma Vista Memorial 
Park in Fullerton. There will also be a memorial service at the Placentia 
Presbyterian Church at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Key is survived by his daughter, Dorothy Jensen, 69; his son, George Jr., 67; 
five grandchildren, and 11 great-grand children.

PILOT ALLEGING 'TORTURE' AT AIRPORT IS ARRAIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside County pilot who flew over former President Reagan's Bel-Air 
Estates home last month and who says he was "tortured" by an Orange County 
sheriff's deputy after landing was arraigned Tuesday on a misdemeanor charge of 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Davis, 43, of Rubidoux appeared briefly before Harbor Municipal Judge 
Selim S. Franklin, who ordered him to return to court March 2 for a pretrial 
conference. Scott D. Raphael, Davis' attorney and also vice president of the 
Orange County Airport Assn., said outside the court in Newport Beach on Tuesday 
that he believes his client will never go to trial because the deputy, whom he 
identified as Charles Shinn, has a "history of harassment at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said he could not comment on 
Tuesday's hearing. However, he has said previously that Davis refused to 
cooperate when the deputy searched him for a weapon and that the deputy had to 
put a wristlock on him to control him. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was ordered to land at John Wayne Airport on Dec. 28 after he and an 
aerial mapping photographer flew over the Reagan home. That airspace was 
restricted whenever then-President Reagan was in residence. However, Davis said 
he received no notice that day about such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that although he was unaware why U.S. Secret Service agents had 
asked him to land at John Wayne, he complied. He says he did not resist the 
deputy who handcuffed his arms behind him on the airfield. On Jan. 5, Davis 
filed a claim -- a legal precursor to a civil lawsuit -- seeking $1 million 
from the county, Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and Gates' department. Davis 
alleges he suffered torn right shoulder muscles when the deputy detained him. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service has said it will not file charges against Davis because 
agents determined that he flew "inadvertently" through the restricted airspace.

COUNCIL RACE QUICKENS IN 5TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of supporters hoisting blue-and-white campaign signs practically cheered 
themselves silly when Laura M. Lake recently announced her plans for a 
grass-roots political assault on Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
"We've beaten Zev before, and we'll beat him again," Lake pledged as she 
formally kicked off her campaign in the shadow of the Westside Pavilion 
shopping center. "We will retake the 5th District block by block and house by 
house." 
</P>
<P>
From that day forward, Lake, the savvy Westwood community activist who poses 
the toughest challenge to Yaroslavsky in the April 11 primary, has been 
tirelessly working to attract the support of a broad range of her fellow 5th 
District activists. But it appears that she has her work cut out for her. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Lake's assertions that his constituents are deserting him, 
Yaroslavsky recently released the names of more than 25 past and present 
community organization leaders who already have committed to backing him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Surrendering' 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't have this many homeowner representatives supporting my reelection 
if there wasn't a certain level of satisfaction," Yaroslavsky said. "I'm not 
surrendering one precinct in this election to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lake when she heard about the names: "I'm not going to get into matching 
lists with him. All that establishes is that he has 25 votes." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Yaroslavsky's list of endorsements will translate into significant 
support on Election Day -- and most political observers believe that it will -- 
remains to be seen. But at the very least, it shows that the councilman, who 
has been vilified by his opponents as a pawn of developers, still enjoys the 
good will of a good many grass-roots activists. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Agay, president of the Westside Community Planning Council and the 
Westwood Design Review Board, is effusive in his praise of Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Performance Spectacular' 
</P>
<P>
"Zev is the best one for the job for a number of reasons," Agay said recently. 
"His performance is spectacular in terms of protecting homeowners and the 
environment. I don't know how we could do better than we have with him." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close, president of the powerful Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., is 
equally impressed. "I think that he has been very effective in our area," Close 
said. "People view him as a leader trying to solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's list shows that he enjoys similar support from neighborhood 
leaders in Benedict Canyon, Century City, Carthay Circle, Beverlywood, Holmby 
Hills, Bel-Air, West Los Angeles, Studio City, Beverly Glen and Melrose-Fairfax 
-- areas that represent a broad cross section of the council district. 
</P>
<P>
His problems come in places where development is especially intensive, such as 
Westwood and the Beverly-La Cienega area. 
</P>
<P>
After dealing with Yaroslavsky on construction of the controversial Ma Maison 
Sofitel Hotel, Diana Plotkin, leader of the Beverly Wilshire Homeowners Assn., 
called him a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destroyed District 
</P>
<P>
"He has completely neglected this community," Plotkin charged. "He has had 13 
years to destroy the 5th Council District, and he has done it." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Brown, who has battled Yaroslavsky over the Westside Pavilion and other 
developments as a leader of Friends of Westwood and the Holmby-Westwood 
Homeowners Assn., says Yaroslavsky has worn out his welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when Zev was sensitive to what was happening," Brown said. 
"Now, when you work with him, you feel like you're getting screwed." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's council foes have been hammering home similar messages for weeks. 
Jack McGrath, who once served as his chief of staff and campaign manager, says 
Yaroslavsky has given tacit approval to growth by failing to stop it. Ryan 
Snyder, a transportation consultant, says 5th District traffic problems are the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest indictment has come from Lake, who blames Yaroslavsky for 
robbing 5th District residents of their quality of life by allowing the area to 
buckle under the weight of commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Things Could Be Better 
</P>
<P>
As she circles the district in her compact car, Lake tells anyone who will 
listen that things could be better. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go over the notorious projects he has been associated with, including 
the Wilshire Corridor, Westwood Village and a string of projects in the Valley, 
you can see that he hasn't been taking care of the district for the last eight 
years," Lake said. "It has been too little, too late." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's opponents say his performance started to decline years ago and 
became especially acute over the past 18 months as he flirted with the idea of 
challenging Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. They contend that his slow-growth 
image, molded on such high-profile efforts as his joint authorship of 
Proposition U, the landmark measure that cut densities citywide, is actually a 
facade. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Brown, president of the Cheviot Hills Homeowners Assn., said she sees no 
evidence of Yaroslavsky's commitment to communities. Instead, she said, she and 
her neighbors must constantly battle development projects independently. 
</P>
<P>
"We're chasing our councilman," said Brown, whose group was involved in recent 
opposition to the expansion of Westside Pavilion. "We're trying to get him to 
play the role that this town needs. We have even had to fight to get people to 
adhere to Proposition U because Zev wasn't doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Disagreements over developmental standards for Westwood Village, the Wilshire 
Corridor and Westside Pavilion are just some of the issues that have placed 
Yaroslavsky at odds with such activists as Lake, a UCLA environmental science 
professor. Yaroslavsky says he has done everything possible to protect those 
areas, including downzoning. But others dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had to take a club and hit Zev on the head and say we didn't want what 
was planned" for Westwood Village, Sandy Brown said. "We weren't getting 
anywhere with him privately. It was not a question of caring. The fact is that 
he is not slow-growth, at least not in the 5th District." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Westside Pavilion 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's splits with certain Westwood factions may also have contributed 
to the undoing of his mayoral bid. In December, Bradley, acting at the behest 
of such Westwood residents as Sandy Brown, vetoed the 105,000-square-foot 
Westside Pavilion expansion plan sponsored by Yaroslavsky on the grounds that 
its connector bridge violated Proposition U development standards. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's supporters called the veto a cheap publicity stunt and said 
Proposition U would have been observed. But a frustrated Yaroslavsky dropped 
his mayoral bid two weeks later, citing unfavorable polling results. 
</P>
<P>
The Westwood Design Review Board's Agay, one of many Westwood activists who 
still stand behind Yaroslavsky, said that in the heat of battle, many people 
forget the good deeds that the councilman has done. 
</P>
<P>
"His plan dramatically downzoned the village," he said. "And the new community 
plan implemented reductions in the size of growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Responsive 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Hunter, president of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. of North 
Hollywood, said Yaroslavsky has always been the most responsive of the five 
councilmen who ended up with parts of North Hollywood during redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
"On our side of the hill, I feel that he has really responded to some very 
difficult issues, especially the light-rail issue," Hunter said. He added that 
Yaroslavsky has taken a stand against it, while others have avoided the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky contends that come Election Day, neighborhood activist supporters 
such as Hunter and Agay will help put him over the top easily. He said Lake's 
support remains limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out on April 11 whether Laura's feelings are shared by other 5th 
District residents," Yaroslavsky said. "I don't think they are." 
</P>
<P>
Lake, however, said the existence of Yaroslavsky's list of supporters raises 
questions about his confidence. "The fact that he has compiled this list shows 
that he is very much on the defensive," she said. "He's running scared."

TEN BASKETBALL STARS NAMED COUNTY'S BEST OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Lewis was the scoring sensation and Rich Branning was a point guard 
extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
LeRon Ellis was the graceful center, and Wayne Carlander was a powerful 
blue-collar forward. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Beeuwsaert was the ultimate team player, and Mark Wulfemeyer was a legend. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, some of the Southern Section's most talented basketball 
players have gained fame, notoriety and scholarships to some of the nation's 
top major colleges while playing for Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
County players dot the section's career scoring list with five listed among the 
top 11 players who have competed in the past 76 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wulfemeyer of Troy, the most electrifying player in county history, is 
second on the list with 2,608 points in 4 seasons. The Wulf averaged a stunning 
27.5 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Tom Lewis (Mater Dei) is fourth at 2,456 points, Wayne Carlander (El 
Toro-Ocean View) sixth at 2,314 points, Adam Keefe (Woodbridge) eighth at 2,212 
points and Johnny Rogers (La Quinta) 11th at 2,012 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has extensively covered the county's best players for the past two 
decades, and began selecting an all-county basketball team 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria for picking the all-star teams have always followed a simple 
formula: The 10 best players regardless of position have been selected with no 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
Following this formula, for the sake of a good argument or some great memories, 
here is The Times' all-Orange County high school basketball team covering the 
past 20 years -- which was based solely on the athletes' high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RICK ABEREGG 
</P>
<P>
Aberegg was a seasoned veteran by the time he reached Katella, having played 6 
seasons on traveling all-star teams for Pete Liapis at the Fullerton Boys Club. 
</P>
<P>
Aberegg was starting on sixth-grade teams as a third-grader and lost only 1 
game in 6 years of youth basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He teamed with another standout guard, Bob Sherwin, at Katella in 1969 to lead 
the Knights to the 2-A championship game in his junior year. Katella lost to 
Verbum Dei, 90-87, in what some consider the greatest basketball title game in 
Southern Section history. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 32 minutes of craziness," Aberegg recalled. "Both teams pressed the 
entire game. Defense created a lot of the points. The next year was my team and 
it was the most fun I ever had playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Aberegg later starred at Fullerton College with Sunny Hills' Brad McNamara and 
transferred to Cal State Long Beach where he played for Jerry Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
Aberegg, 37, plays for fun in an Anaheim recreation league where he admits he 
has developed a liking for the 3-point shot. "It's nothing to make those," he 
said. "Where were they when I played?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MATT BEEUWSAERT 
</P>
<P>
Was there anything Matt Beeuwsaert couldn't do? 
</P>
<P>
"He did everything for us," said Gary McKnight, Mater Dei coach. "He brought 
the ball up the court. He scored. He rebounded. Plus, he was a great kid who 
always put the team ahead of himself." 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert was named the Southern Section's 4-A Player of Year in 1982 after 
leading Mater Dei to its first of five 4-A championships as a junior, but his 
overall game suffered his senior year when McKnight moved him to point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert's scoring, rebounding and field-goal percentage marks dropped from 
the previous year as the spotlight shifted to center Tom Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back, the moves only broadened my game," he said. "I looked at the 
added responsibilities as a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert started for three seasons, earning All-Southern Section honors each 
year. Digger Phelps signed him without ever seeing him play a game. 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert went to Notre Dame, the school he said he always wanted to attend, 
but left after his sophomore year because of lack of playing time and is now 
starting for the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RICH BRANNING 
</P>
<P>
Branning always seemed to be a step ahead of opposing defenses. He had the rare 
quality of seeing the entire court and making split-second decisions while 
running the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I get more enjoyment out of making a nice pass than I do making a basket," he 
once said. "I get more of a feeling of being involved with the team by passing 
than I do shooting." 
</P>
<P>
"By far, the best high school point guard I've seen," said Steve Popovich, 
Marina coach. "The only one who comes close is (former Verbum Dei star) Roy 
Hamilton." 
</P>
<P>
Many thought Branning and Hamilton would be matched in the 4-A championship 
game in 1975, but Palos Verdes upset Verbum Dei in the semifinals and then beat 
Marina in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
Branning developed into a scorer his senior year, averaging 27.4 points per 
game, but Marina was upset in the first round of the playoffs by Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
"Rich had two bad ankles, a 104-degree temperature and we never had a chance," 
Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WAYNE CARLANDER 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harris, Ocean View coach, claimed he always knew when Wayne Carlander was 
going to have a big game because his knees were shaking during warmups. 
</P>
<P>
One particular night, Carlander's knees were rumbling. Playing against 
arch-rival Katella, Carlander scored 50 points and had 19 rebounds in what many 
consider the best single-game performance in county history. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "The Franchise" at Ocean View, Carlander once had 33 rebounds in a 
game as a senior and ranks fourth on the section's career list with 1,325 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The lefthander seldom displayed emotion and rarely spoke, but he never backed 
off. He wasn't the quickest player, but no one questioned his competitive 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Carlander was also an iron man. He never missed a game in high school or 
college, starting every game in four years at USC where he became the career 
scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
Carlander attend El Toro as a freshman, then transferred to Ocean View where he 
played from 1978-81. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LeRON ELLIS 
</P>
<P>
A Renaissance man at Mater Dei, Ellis cooked gingerbread houses, auditioned for 
the school play and even doubled as a hole man in water polo when he wasn't 
busy leading the Monarchs to the State Division I title as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was named the state's player of the year in 1987 after averaging 23 
points, 10 rebounds, 4 blocked shots and 2 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
"The most graceful big man I've ever seen in high school," McKnight said. 
"There wasn't anything he couldn't do athletically." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis proved McKnight's point by high jumping 6 feet 8 inches in his only track 
meet as a senior. He was also the water polo team's leading scorer that season. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some questioned his intensity, aggressiveness and mental toughness. He 
proved the doubters by starting seven games as a freshman at Kentucky last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"LeRon probably can run the floor as well as any big man I've ever seen," said 
Kentucky Coach Eddie Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ADAM KEEFE 
</P>
<P>
The victories, scoring and rebounding exploits and MVP trophies were great, but 
Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon said one of the great tributes to Keefe was that 
he never heard an opposing coach, player, member of the media or teacher say a 
negative thing about the redhead. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a reflection upon his family and the way he was raised," Shannon said. 
"He's a class guy. When it came time to sign with a college, he didn't give 
academics lip service." Keefe signed with Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe, along with talented teammates David Townsend and Vince Bryan, led 
Woodbridge to the State Division II championship as a junior in 1987, but was 
two games shy of repeating as a senior with a less talented supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe worked diligently to become a good player, playing in hundreds of summer 
league and pickup games. "A workaholic," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe is almost certain of being selected to the all-Pacific 10 freshman team 
and there is a good possibility he will be selected to play for the West team 
in the Olympic Festival this summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOM LEWIS 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized player in the county's most publicized program, Lewis 
helped Mater Dei compile an 86-5 record in three brilliant seasons. Mater Dei 
finished 29-0 in 1985, the only county school ever to finish undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis once scored 20 points in a quarter against Banning in the Tournament of 
Champions and most of those came during a 4-minute stretch in which Mater Dei 
used a fullcourt press. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was strong, quick, and above all, determined. He could score inside, 
outside or from 3-point range. He played in three straight championship games 
and the only player who ever stopped him was DeMatha's Danny Ferry, now 
considered one of college basketball's best players. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also made headlines off the court during a troubled recruiting period 
before finally signing with USC, turning down offers from Kentucky, Maryland, 
Nevada Las Vegas, Syracuse and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
If one player were to be selected as the county's best over the past 20 years, 
Lewis would win the honor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHNNY ROGERS 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Rogers, a prolific shooter, was described as "a guard trapped inside a 
center's body." Former USC Coach Stan Morrison once called Johnny Rogers "the 
best shooting big man I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
J.R. could flat-out shoot. He never brought the ball down below his numbers and 
seldom put the ball on the floor. He scored 40 or more points nine times during 
his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers shot 60.6% from the field and 78% from the foul line as a senior. He 
scored 40 and 45 points in playoff victories over West Covina and Dominguez 
that season. In his junior year in 1980, he led his team to the 3-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers signed with Stanford, transferred to UC Irvine for his junior and senior 
seasons and then was drafted on the second round by the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
He played two seasons in the NBA before signing with Real Madrid of Spain, one 
of the best club teams in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JACK TUZ 
</P>
<P>
Students would chant, "Jack Tuz is what it's all about" whenever Tuz made a 
difficult play look routine. 
</P>
<P>
He had a memorable dunk against Long Beach Poly's Dino Gregory in the 
Tournament of Champions as a senior that dazzled the media and college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the players I coached, he had the most physical abilities," said former 
Corona del Mar Coach Jack Errion. "He was strong, could run like a deer and 
really jump." 
</P>
<P>
Tuz averaged 16.4 points as a senior, leading Corona del Mar to its first 
Southern Section title in 1977 with a 56-50 overtime victory over Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARK WULFEMEYER 
</P>
<P>
Football star Mickey Flynn of Anaheim and guard Mark Wulfemeyer of Troy are the 
county's legendary prep stars. 
</P>
<P>
Wulfemeyer, a 4-year starter from 1970-74, played with a style and flair that 
no one since has come close to matching. 
</P>
<P>
Last-second shots? Wulfemeyer was the master, frequently hitting halfcourt 
shots at the buzzer to end a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ball-handling skills? Wulfemeyer could dribble faster than most of his 
opponents could run. He faced every gimmick defense devised and averaged 27.5 
points every time he suited up. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with USC and several weeks later with the Angels, both of which he 
said he would change if given the opportunity to do over again. 
</P>
<P>
"But I had a lot of fun playing the game, and no one can take that away from 
me," he said. "I'm having a lot of fun coaching my son these days. He's going 
to be a good athlete some day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
HILL IS NOW THE TALK OF THE TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Stacey Augmon wanted was a little bit of friendly conversation. 
</P>
<P>
After all, if Augmon, a former Olympian and Nevada Las Vegas' star forward, and 
Cal State Fullerton guard Mark Hill were going to share the floor of the Thomas 
&amp; Mack Center for 40 minutes, they might as well be sociable. Right? 
</P>
<P>
So Augmon talked. And talked. And talked. According to Hill, the dialogue went 
something like this: 
</P>
<P>
Augmon: "In your face! In your face! In your face! You guys can't buy a win." 
</P>
<P>
Hill: Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon: "What a brick. Get a team, why don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Hill: Silence. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went on Jan 16, up and down the floor of the Thomas &amp; Mack -- an 
arena generally known as the place where the teams of the Big West Conference 
go to lose. Augmon was aiming his up-close-and-personal court banter at Hill's 
concentration, and he was using all the weapons at his disposal -- especially 
UNLV's top 20 ranking and Fullerton's then-winless conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon was talking, but Hill wasn't listening. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Augmon's chatter might have rattled Hill, who readily admits that 
at Harbor College -- where he was a 2-time first-team All-Southern California 
Athletic Conference selection -- his temper often used to get the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
But not against UNLV, and rarely at all anymore. Hill was determined to show 
Augmon and the Runnin' Rebels that he had turned over a new leaf. Augmon was 
running into the new and improved, level-headed Mark Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Augmon was trying to get into a street-talking match," Hill said. "But I don't 
do that anymore. I just told him, 'Jeez, play ball!' Basketball isn't about all 
that talk." 
</P>
<P>
Hill proved his point, even though Fullerton lost the game, 66-63, on a shot at 
the buzzer by UNLV's Greg Anthony. Hill fired away from the outside and scored 
19 points that night. His teammate, forward Cedric Ceballos, scored 31. Augmon, 
who was guarding Ceballos, scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fans would be surprised to learn that Hill, a smooth and serious 
junior, ever had a problem with composure on the court. Especially after Hill, 
who is averaging 16 points a game, emerged as the Titans' most consistent 
all-around player earlier this season when Ceballos was going through a 4-game 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has scored 26 points in a game twice this season, against New Mexico State 
and Utah State. Against New Mexico State, he had a career-high 6 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his 3-point accuracy -- he is hitting 44% -- Hill's particular talents 
include an ability to use his vertical leap to shoot over opponents, and an 
ability to hang on his shot, drawing a foul. 
</P>
<P>
Hill stepped into some pretty big shoes when he cracked Fullerton's lineup as 
the starting shooting guard. For 4 years, that slot had belonged to Richard 
Morton, who averaged 22 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Even Fullerton Coach John Sneed had his doubts that Hill would be able to shake 
off the temperamental reputation he had been branded with at Harbor. But after 
watching Hill this season, Sneed said he has readjusted his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark is tougher mentally now," Sneed said. "He doesn't get frustrated on the 
court as much anymore. He used to go in the tank and get upset when things 
weren't going his way. Now, he just plays through those things. He's made great 
strides in keeping his composure." 
</P>
<P>
Hill admitted that he once reached his breaking point before he could get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
That point came about last season, midway through the SCAC schedule, in a game 
between Harbor and Mt. San Jacinto, both undefeated at the time. Hill, who was 
the SCAC's scoring leader at 23 points per game, had been waging a battle of 
words all evening long with Mt. San Jacinto swingman Jerry Robinson. About 
three minutes into the second half, with Harbor ahead, Robinson connected with 
an elbow underneath Hill's chin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a flagrant elbow, so I went after the guy," Hill said. "I just reacted. 
I grabbed him with both hands by his throat and just shook him." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson swung back, but only grazed Hill's face. It took both benches, the 
referees and the police to separate the two players. After a 10-minute delay, 
Hill was ejected, and with the Seahawks' most dangerous weapon out of the game, 
Mt. San Jacinto rallied for an 85-79 victory. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Harbor coaches Ken Curry and Jim White were furious. Curry 
blamed the loss on Hill and was quoted as saying Hill had a lot of maturing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches were really upset at me," Hill said. "I could see my college 
career flashing in front of my eyes. So I apologized personally to the police 
officers that were involved and to the president of the school." 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, Hill's self-command improved game by game. He inked "HAVE 
POISE" on the backs of his high-tops so that he could see the words when he was 
on the bench during timeouts. And he tested his temper on things in everyday 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to keep my cool, just going through the motions on things that 
happen every day," Hill said. "It made me a stronger person. It would have to 
take something really drastic to get me to go off like that again." 
</P>
<P>
That's all to the Titans' benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"From Oct. 15, he's become the biggest surprise," Sneed said. "He ended up as 
the starter and he's been an overachiever on the Division I level." STUART 
MATTHEWS

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE BEATS PEPPERDINE IN TENNIS FOR FIRST TIME IN 13 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite losing its No. 1 singles player, Trevor Kronemann, for a portion of the 
match, fifth-ranked UC Irvine rallied to defeat 12th-ranked Pepperdine Tuesday, 
5-4, in a men's nonconference tennis match at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Irvine's first over Pepperdine in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann turned an ankle just prior to his singles match and had to forfeit. 
But later, he teammed with Mike Briggs to defeat Kevin O'Neill and Christophe 
Van De Weghe, 6-4, 6-3, to cap an Irvine rally. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine trailed, 2-4, after the singles portion of the match, but swept the 
doubles to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Kronemann/Briggs, Irvine received doubles victories from No. 2 Mark 
Kaplan and Richard Lubner, defeating Grant Saacks and David Wells-Roth, 6-4, 
5-7, 6-2, and No. 3 Mike Cadigan and Aaron Stolpman, defeating Tomer Zimmerman 
and Mark Hansen, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In Golden State Athletic Conference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 103, Point Loma Nazarene 95 -- Jeff Bickmore scored 
a career-high 37 points and had 13 rebounds, Todd Dixon and Terry Scruggs each 
scored 15 points to lead SCC (19-2, 7-0) at Pt. Loma. 
</P>
<P>

TITANS BEAT CHAPMAN IN THEIR BASEBALL OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton rallied for 3 runs in the seventh inning on its way to a 
6-3 victory over Chapman in a nonconference baseball game Tuesday in front of 
about 250 at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
It was the season opener for Fullerton, which finished third in the College 
World Series last season. Chapman is 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton rally came at the expense of Chapman pitcher David Bird, a junior 
left-hander from Sonora High School. Bird appeared in control over the first 6 
innings, allowing 2 runs and 6 hits. 
</P>
<P>
He had thrown 106 pitches through 6 innings and Chapman Coach Mike Weathers 
said it was a gamble to let Bird continue in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to stretch him out," Weathers said about Bird. "He pitched a good 
game for the first 6 innings but he got tired and went to the fastball too much 
in the seventh." 
</P>
<P>
Bird's problems started with the first hitter. Rex Peters hit a home run to 
left to tie it, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Gonzales followed with a single to center and then Brent Mayne singled to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Rod Klopfer then bunted back to Bird, who looked at third but 
decided to go to first -- only to have disaster strike. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman first baseman Mike Guiseffi, who had charged on the bunt, was about 5 
feet from the bag when he caught the ball. Klopfer was credited with a single 
and Fullerton had the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ramirez followed with a single, good for one run, and Fullerton led, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bird was replaced by Matt Patuano, who allowed a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter 
Trevor Neighbors before retiring the side. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got its final run in the eighth on a single by Peters, a throwing 
error and an RBI single by Brent Mayne. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne, who hit .393 last season and Peters, who hit .330, were each 3 for 5 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman shortstop Randy Graves had 3 hits and Klopfer and Mate Borgogno had 2 
hits for Fullerton, which had 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans did leave 11 runners left on base, though, including 7 by lead-off 
hitter Bobby Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the way we swung the bat," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell 
said. "But we have to have a lot better production with men on base." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman had taken a 2-0 lead in the second. Jeff Kidwiler singled with 2 out 
and Tony Gardea followed with a home run, his first this season, over the 
left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got a run back in the fourth on a double by Klopfer, who went to 
third on a double play and scored on a balk. 
</P>
<P>
Graves tripled in the fifth for Fullerton and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman took a 3-2 lead in the sixth on a triple by Ken Briggs and a sacrifice 
fly by Rod Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Robinson, a sophomore right-hander from Troy High School, worked the 
final 3 innings allowing a hit and 2 walks for the victory.

MAN HELD AFTER RAID ON SUSPECTED BOILER-ROOM SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach home was raided early Tuesday morning and an occupant was 
arrested on suspicion of grand theft for allegedly operating a precious-metals 
boiler-room scam and bilking investors out of about $100,000, Newport Beach 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Matthew Dickey, 24, is suspected of running a telemarketing scheme called 
Eastern Financial Services (EFS) from a variety of apartments and condominiums 
and the house that was raided, Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation started in Newport Beach and ended up in Huntington Beach, Newman 
said. U.S. Postal Service agents and Newport police participated in the raid on 
the house at 10202 Beverly Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey, 24, was held on $100,000 bail. The scheme that Dickey is accused of 
masterminding was in operation from August, 1987, to December, 1988, Newman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"EFS salesmen would apparently make unsolicited phone calls to potential 
investors nationwide, using what investigators are describing as high-pressure 
sales tactics to induce clients into investing money with EFS," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Clients from New York, Delaware, Texas, Arizona and Ohio sent money to EFS 
based on their understanding that it would be used to buy leverage contracts on 
platinum and silver. 
</P>
<P>
"It is alleged that Dickey then converted these funds from the clients to his 
own personal use and was not investing them as promised," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport police and postal agents started investigating Dickey in June, tracing 
him from condominium to condominium. Postal Inspector Kacy R. McClelland said 
authorities believe that Dickey had dealings with about 10 would-be investors. 
</P>
<P>
"He used all kinds of aliases," McClelland said, "and he moved around 
frequently."

EIP MICROWAVE POSTS LOSS FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EIP Microwave, Newport Beach, reported a loss of $192,000 for its first quarter 
ended Dec. 31, 1988, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of $729,000. Sales 
rose 26% to $3.1 million from $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The current year's first-quarter loss included a pretax charge against 
operations of $1.1 million resulting from the write-down of certain assets 
associated with the company's realignment of technical, financial and 
management resources. Partially offsetting the loss was a gain of $748,000 
resulting from an accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
The company manufactures microwave test and measurement instruments used in the 
defense and telecommunications industries.

ANAHEIM CONVENTION OF PROCESSORS; 
</P>
<P>
BUYOUT FRENZY THROUGH '89 SEEN IN FOOD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flurry of big-name buyouts and mergers that began last year among U.S. food 
manufacturers should continue at the same frenzied pace in 1989, industry 
executives and financial experts said Tuesday in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
With Wall Street money managers sitting in a $25-billion pool of investors' 
funds, analysts believe that there is enough money available to fuel up to $250 
billion in corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can bet some of that money is going to be used this year," said Porter 
Morgan, vice president for marketing of the American Stock Exchange, speaking 
to 400 members of the National Assn. of Food Processors. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and a panel of food industry executives agreed that buyouts and mergers 
-- such as the giant RJR Nabisco and Pillsbury deals -- will continue at 
roughly the same pace as last year because big companies have found that it is 
cheaper to increase profits through mergers rather than make large investments 
in researching new products, modernized processing plants and market expansion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undervalued Stock Prices 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most stock analysts believe that stock prices of some food 
companies are significantly undervalued, making them more attractive takeover 
targets for investors, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
"That $25-billion equity pool is waiting, looking for a home. It is looking for 
the right deals," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the increased merger activity could rob the U.S. Treasury of tax 
dollars and research into new food products has slowed, most leveraged buyouts 
and mergers have improved the health of the companies involved and have not 
adversely affected consumers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan backed that assessment with preliminary results of a survey in which the 
American Stock Exchange asked 70 middle-size companies involved in recent 
buyouts and mergers whether the deals turned out to be good for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority, Morgan said, were as strong or stronger than before the 
merger and had not sold off assets or closed plants, debunking the myth that 
buyouts lead to layoffs and reduced productivity. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, most of the companies said their research and development 
activities for new products had slowed because managers were more concerned 
with paying off huge debts incurred by the company in the buyout and merger 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly $100 billion was loaned by U.S. banks to leveraged buyouts and mergers 
in 1988, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are too many defaults and failures after mergers, or if interest 
rates shoot up, the banks could be facing a crisis that could be called their 
next 'Third World debt crisis,' " Morgan said. "I believe the Congress ought to 
look at the capital-gains issues." 
</P>
<P>
Because companies can write off some debt they incur in a buyout, the total 
loss to the country's tax rolls could run into the billions of dollars, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The downside, however, is not enough to discourage new mergers in the future. 
"They are lucrative, and how do you say no to a deal the size of RJR Nabisco?" 
Morgan asked, pointing out that bankers, brokers and lawyers will reap roughly 
$500 million in fees from that deal alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry executives in Anaheim speculated that Gerber Products Inc. and 
Borden Inc. are likely 1989 takeover targets.

MAI EXTENDS OFFER, SAYS 72.6% OF PRIME SHARES ARE TENDERED

<P>
MAI Basic Four said Tuesday that 72.6% of Prime Computer's common stock 
outstanding has been tendered under its $970-million takeover offer for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the company extended its offer until midnight EST on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
As of midnight Monday, 33 million Prime common shares had been surrendered, 
together with 1.9 million shares already owned by MAI and an affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
MAI has said its offer is contingent upon at least 67% of Prime's 61.8 million 
common shares and equivalents being tendered. When all types of Prime shares 
are taken into account -- including bonds convertible into stock -- only 57% of 
Prime's shares have been tendered. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin computer company, launched its $20-a-share buyout offer on Nov. 
15. Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer manufacturer, has strongly resisted 
the offer. DAVID OLMOS

PIANO TO SHOW FINAL MUSEUM PLAN IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian architect Renzo Piano will unveil his final design for the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum's new building on March 28 during a lecture at UC Irvine, the 
last in a four-part series of evening talks about museum design by 
internationally prominent architects. "Artworks or Containers: Issues in 
Contemporary Museum Architecture" is being jointly sponsored by Newport Harbor 
and the Architecture Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The series will open Thursday with a talk by Richard Meier of Richard Meier 
&amp; Partners, which has offices in New York and Los Angeles. Meier has said 
that he tries "to clarify and redefine a sense of order within society." His 
buildings are known for their simplicity and their crisp white surfaces, 
careful distinctions between solids and open spaces, and the lack of applied 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to numerous residences, medical facilities and commercial 
buildings, Meier's firm has designed the Museum for Decorative Arts in 
Frankfurt, West Germany; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the Museum of 
Modern Art in Florence. More recently, Meier has been working on the design of 
the new J. Paul Getty Center headquarters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Feb. 23, the speaker will be Ricardo Legorreta of Legorreta 
Arquitectos, Mexico City. Legorreta is celebrated for his return to the "wall 
culture" of his Mexican heritage, with its accent on solids rather than open 
spaces, its emphasis on privacy and the use of vibrant color. 
</P>
<P>
Legorreta's firm, which competed against Piano's for the Newport Harbor design 
commission, has designed the Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose as well as 
numerous hotels and offices in Mexico, actor Ricardo Montalban's house in Los 
Angeles and the Tustin Market Place (where his controversial bright purple 
walls were repainted after a flurry of complaints last December). 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, March 9, the speaker will be Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelblau Firm, 
which has offices in Vienna and Los Angeles. Prix's firm (founded in 1968, when 
the young principals were caught up in the fever of student uprisings in 
Europe) is something of a curiosity in architectural circles because of its 
improvisatory working habits, similar to those of experimental musicians in 
rock clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to catch the psychic qualities of the space," Prix recently told an 
interviewer. Coop Himmelblau makes use of surrealist-inspired "automatic 
writing" ("We close our eyes and let the pencil record our feelings," Prix 
said) and creates designs through silent consensus ("We discuss issues but 
never the design itself"). 
</P>
<P>
Coop Himmelblau's varied projects include a theater renovation, offices, a 
school, a bar, a town plan and a private residence called Open House in Malibu 
-- which they dreamed up before even trying to find a client who would 
understand and accept it. The firm has yet to design a museum, however. 
</P>
<P>
Finally on March 28, Piano -- designer of the Menil Collection Museum in 
Houston and co-designer of the Georges Pompidou Cultural Center in Paris -- 
will speak about his working process. 
</P>
<P>
Piano, of Genoa, is noted for his flexibility in dealing with vastly different 
client needs. He has said that he attempts to "apply the pleasure of discovery 
in the specific design and detail of each part of the buildings" he creates. 
</P>
<P>
 All lectures will be in the Main Lecture Hall, Nelson Research Building, UC 
Irvine, at 7:30 p.m. Admission: $15 per lecture. Reservations suggested. 
Information: (714) 557-7769.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: '10TH SYMPHONY' NEEDS A BEETHOVEN TO MAKE IT 
WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the Orange County Performing Arts Center tonight and Thursday night, Keith 
Clark will lead the Pacific Symphony through Beethoven's "Tenth Symphony." 
Surprised that such a work exists? You're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the work is not a full-fledged symphony. And no one says that it is 
really by Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
It consists of just one movement -- lasting about 15 minutes -- as 
reconstructed from the composer's widely scattered sketches, fragments and 
jottings. It was put together last year by Barry Cooper, 39, a professor of 
music at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who reportedly spent 5 years surveying 8,000 pages of sketches, 
maintains (in a statement distributed by the symphony) that "there is more than 
enough thematic material for the first movement in Beethoven's sketches, so 
that a realization of it does not include any significant new motives, just 
developments, extrapolations and continuations." 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics reacted with caution at the work's premiere by the Royal 
Liverpool Philharmonic, directed by Walter Weller, on Oct. 18. (The U.S. 
premiere was given by Jose Serebrier and the American Symphony on Oct. 23. 
George Cleve and the San Jose Symphony offered the California premiere in 
November. There is a recording by Wyn Morris and the London Symphony.) 
</P>
<P>
One London critic called it "a short-lived wonder which will disappear into 
justified oblivion." Critic and scholar Andrew Porter, in the Nov. 28 issue of 
the New Yorker, agreed that the work is "unconvincing." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an essay 'in the manner of Beethoven,' which again and again bumps over 
the switches, lurches, noodles through development sections," Porter wrote. 
"Some of it sounds more like Schumann imitation." 
</P>
<P>
One might well wonder: If Beethoven felt he had something left to say in a 
symphony, why -- after finishing his monumental Ninth in early 1824 -- did he 
spend the rest of his life (2 1/2 years) writing only string quartets? 
</P>
<P>
Still, as news spread of his final illness (he would die of jaundice and 
ascites on March 26, 1827), the Philharmonic Society of London sent him a 
get-well gift of 100 pounds. Touched deeply, he told the society that 
"sketches" for a Tenth Symphony were "already in my desk." 
</P>
<P>
After his death, though, his sketchbooks were ransacked by souvenir hunters and 
widely scattered, not to be re-collected until late in the 19th Century, and 
even then pages remained missing. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars say fragments of many uncompleted works, including other symphonies, 
can be found among the sketches that survive. 
</P>
<P>
It just takes a Beethoven to put them together. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Clark will conduct Barry Cooper's reconstruction of Beethoven's "Tenth 
Symphony" tonight and Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Also on the program: Brahms' First 
Piano Concerto, with soloist Horacio Gutierrez, and Joseph Schwanter's "New 
Morning for the World," with text by Martin Luther King Jr., narrated by 
baritone William Warfield. Tickets: $9 to $49. Information: (714) 556-2787.

WORKS OF THE 'JEWISH BACH' PERFORMED BY KOL ECHAD CHORALE AND ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you haven't heard of David Nowakowsky, you aren't the only one. The 
19th-Century composer and synagogue musician is not listed in either the New 
Grove or Baker's dictionary. Thus, Sunday's program at Temple Bat Yahm in 
Newport Beach offered a rare opportunity to hear music by a man one writer 
calls the "Jewish Bach." 
</P>
<P>
But, aside from the fact that Nowakowsky put his talent into the service of his 
faith, there is little to justify the sobriquet. His music is harmonically 
static, rhythmically bland and only sometimes contrapuntal. It does effectively 
integrate the modal and melodic elements of Jewish chant into a harmonic style 
akin to a number of Russian composers of the 19th Century but is bogged down by 
repetition and predictability. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Alan Weiner effectively led the Kol Echad Chorale and Orchestra in 
six of the composer's works. Aside from a few minor pitch problems, the 
25-voice volunteer choir sang with considerable polish. The orchestra was 
first-rate, and one should single out concertmaster Mark Kashper, who delivered 
the important violin solos with virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor David Lefkowitz proved an impassioned soloist in five of the works. 
Unfortunately, the New York-based cantor produced a thin sound, exhibited 
limited fluency in melismatic passages and had a distracting tendency to shift 
from side to side continuously. 
</P>
<P>
Before intermission, baritone Nathan Lam served as cantor in Milhaud's 
infrequently heard Service Sacre. Lam sang with a clear, resonant sound and 
fine expression but ran into pitch problems in his upper register. The work 
exhibits both reflective calm and Gallic exuberance, but seems to go on 
forever; there is simply too much music and too little variety.

General Motors Corp. said Tuesday that it had agreed on a multimillion-dollar 
settlement to end a 6-year-old class-action lawsuit claiming that the leading 
auto maker discriminates against salaried black employees. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, if given final approval by a federal judge in Detroit, could be 
worth up to $40 million over the next 10 years to 10,000 current and former GM 
employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, spokesmen for the plaintiffs said. 
</P>
<P>
GM, the largest U.S. company, said the agreement calls for payment of about $3 
million in immediate grants to former employees and pay raises for 1,000 
current staff members. 
</P>
<P>
GM has about 8,400 blacks on its U.S. salaried staff of about 90,000, not 
counting the company's financing units, GM spokeswoman Patricia Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit-based GM agreed to set up a new affirmative action monitoring system to 
assure that blacks among its white-collar staff get equitable treatment in 
future promotions and raises. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all salaried employees -- black or not -- will be covered by a new 
system in which they can appeal their supervisors' performance appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the auto maker nor the plaintiffs conceded the other side's legal 
claims in agreeing to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs said GM's old performance appraisal system, scrapped in late 
1987, has hurt black employees since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had a serious chance to win their case charging systemic bias 
when a judge agreed two years ago to hear the suit as a class action covering 
all black salaried staff in the three affected states, civil rights lawyer 
Dennis James said. The ruling would allow representative witnesses and 
statistical evidence in the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Detroit attorney said an actual trial would have taken "the better part 
of a year," with appeals of any ruling postponing the final resolution of the 
dispute for many years. 
</P>
<P>
As for the settlement, "This decree will help blacks attain their rightful 
places in the upper management of General Motors and help ensure fairness in 
the decision-making process," said the Rev. James Kennedy, a lead plaintiff who 
retired after 31 years with the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
GM Vice President Richard O'Brien said in a statement that the auto maker is 
"proud of our track record regarding equal employment and affirmative action, 
and I believe this agreement will further strengthen and support our existing 
programs and policies in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said the agreement, contained in a five-year consent decree, calls for 
the following: 
</P>
<P>
* GM payments from a $1.6-million fund to about 2,800 former employees. 
</P>
<P>
* Raises averaging $1,000 a year for about 1,000 of the 6,800 current black 
staff in the three states whose pay is most out of line with their "statistical 
white counterparts." 
</P>
<P>
* A new "group monitoring system" for promotions to last five years and 
"leading to an estimated increase of 25% in black promotions." 
</P>
<P>
* A monitoring system for discretionary pay raises for five years to ensure 
compliance with the decree's statistical formula. GM agreed to pay a penalty if 
it fails to meet specificed affirmative action goals. 
</P>
<P>
* A new "individual monitoring system" giving all GM salaried employees a way 
to appeal supervisors' rating of their work. 
</P>
<P>
* A one-time distribution of $325,000 to be divided among 82 "anecdotal" and 
potential witnesses and plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
* GM to pay all of the plaintiffs' costs and fees in the suit, which James put 
at more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said the cumulative value of the settlement could range from $20 
million to $40 million, depending on GM's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
The figures cover increases in black employees' current and future pay rates, 
benefits that are based on pay rates and their chances for promotion to higher 
paying jobs, James said, adding: "These are raises they otherwise wouldn't have 
gotten."

Duff &amp; Phelps has upgraded its ratings on the long-term and short-term 
securities of BankAmerica in response to the San Francisco banking company's 
financial performance in 1988 and high expectations for the current year. The 
Chicago-based ratings agency said the improved ratings reflected "significant 
improvement in operating profitability, continued progress in asset quality and 
further enhancement of the capital base" at the parent company of Bank of 
America, California's largest bank. Senior debt was raised a notch to 
D&amp;P-7, equivalent to low single A, and short-term certificates of deposit 
went up to Duff 1-.

Ryder System Inc. said today it plans to repurchase up to 15% of its common 
stock on the open market and is exploring the sale of its Insurance Management 
Services Division and other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its board has authorized the repurchase of up to about 12 
million common shares, worth $340 million at the current market price, over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder shares rose $1.25 to $28.25 in active trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
It also said it is holding talks with an "offshore company" that it did not 
identify, on the sale of its freight forwarding and customers brokerage unit, 
Ryder International Freight and Customs Services Inc. In addition, it has 
retained advisers to arrange the sale of its U.S. Packing and Shipping Co. 
freight assembly and distribution unit and Ryder Freight System, a 
full-truckload common carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ryder was selling under-performing units as a response to the 
past year's disappointing earnings after steady profit growth in its basic 
truck-leasing business over the past decade. In the third quarter, its earnings 
edged up to $55.3 million from $52.7 million in the prior quarter. Revenues 
climbed to $1.27 billion from $1.16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The sales of the various units will raise more than $100 million, Ryder 
Chairman M. Anthony Burns said in a telephone interview. The sales are not 
expected to result in any earnings reductions from selling the under-performing 
units at below book value, he said.

Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's biggest auto maker, will sell 30,000 autos a 
year in the United States through Chrysler Corp. beginning in 1991, a Hyundai 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai will sell, through Chrysler's Eagle Division, a four-door sedan with a 
2,400-cubic centimeter engine that will be assembled at Hyundai's newly opened 
plant in Bromont, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has not decided yet whether the model will be the Sonata, currently on 
sale in the United States, or a completely new model. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's Canadian plant, the first Korean auto assembly plant outside Korea, 
has been producing Sonatas since Jan. 13 and will produce about 30,000 Sonatas 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity will increase to 100,000 units by 1991. About 50,000 autos will be 
sold in the United States directly by Garden Grove-based Hyundai Motor America 
and 20,000 units will be sold in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
With the alliance between Hyundai and Chrysler, all three major South Korean 
auto makers will be teamed up with the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Daewoo Motor 
is 50% owned by General Motors Corp. and Kia Motors is 10% owned by Ford Motor 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
GM's Pontiac Division now markets Daewoo's LeMans in the United States.

The U.S. dollar was mixed in nervous European trading today as financial 
markets await results of Friday's meeting of finance ministers and central 
bankers from the seven major industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell slightly in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they expect the dollar to move in a narrow range ahead of Friday's 
meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven and the release that day of U.S. 
unemployment figures. 
</P>
<P>
A trader at a large West German bank said he does not expect any major news to 
come out of Friday's meeting but nevertheless attributed the light trading to 
concern in the market about possible surprise developments. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
surged 1.27 yen to a closing 130.40 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted lower 
at 129.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's levels were: 
1.8725 West German marks, up from 1.8710; 1.5845 Swiss francs, down from 
1.5985; 6.3600 French francs, up from 6.3580; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 
2.1100; 1,367.50 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00; and 1.1895 Canadian dollars, 
up from 1.1840. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.7500 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.7535 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $393 a troy ounce, compared with 
late Tuesday's $394.25.

USX CORP. PROBLEMS CORRECTED, CHAIRMAN SAYS 
</P>

<P>
USX Corp. Chairman David Roderick said today that the company has corrected 
problems in the steel division that had caused steel profits to fall below the 
company's expectations last year. 
</P>
<P>
USX had predicted that its steel profits in 1988 would be about $60 per ton 
shipped. But the US Steel unit, the nation's largest steelmaker, achieved a 
profit of only about $40 a ton shipped. Roderick said the $60 level will be hit 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Declines in tubular steel sales in the second half, higher than expected costs 
and a fire at the large Gary, Ind., steelworks all hurt steel profit levels, 
Roderick said in a briefing on the earnings report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't quite do as well in running our mills in the second half as we did 
in the first half," Roderick said. The start-up of a Fairfield, Ala., steel 
plant cost more than expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
USX took a pretax charge of $101 million against fourth-quarter steel earnings 
to cover the start-up of Fairfield, an adjustment to the costs of its major 
1986 restructuring, retiree labor costs and other items. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the charge the company reported a profit of $158 million on sales of 
$4.4 billion in the quarter, contrasted with a loss of $14 million on sales of 
$4.3 billion a year ago. In 1988 as a whole, USX net income more than tripled 
to $756 million. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Corry, who will succeed Roderick as chairman and chief executive on 
June 1, said USX's earnings outlook for 1989 was better than 1988 but declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Divest Steel 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Corry said USX does not plan to divest its steel 
operations, as some had speculated that it might do when it began a 
restructuring two years ago to avoid a takeover by investor Carl Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
Corry said he could not speculate about Icahn's intentions regarding USX. "He 
can answer that better than I can," Corry said. "We can't say what his 
intentions are." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who holds 11.4% of USX, has not added to his holdings since acquiring 
the stake in late 1986, Corry noted. 
</P>
<P>
Corry said that he is not as close to Icahn as Roderick but that the three men 
meet occasionally to discuss USX. 
</P>
<P>
"Steel is definitely going to continue to be a part of USX," he said. But the 
performance of the USS steel unit since its 1986 restructuring has not been 
tested in an industry downturn, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick said the company will ship 1 million more tons in 1989 than the 12.2 
million in 1988.

STANFORD RECRUITS NO. 1 WHITFIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford University has scored a recruiting coup by receiving a verbal 
commitment from the nation's highest-rated high school offensive lineman, 
according to reports published today. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Whitfield, a 6-foot, 7-inch, 275-pound tackle from Banning High School in 
Wilmington, notified Stanford of his decision on Tuesday, the San Francisco 
Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner reported. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford spokesman Bob Vazquez said today he could not comment on the reports 
until national letter-of-intent day next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen Wallace of SuperPrep magazine in Orange County, which rated Whitfield 
No. 1 among offensive linemen, called it "the recruiting coup of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"For Stanford to turn the corner, they had to get a player like this," Wallace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal finished 3-6-2 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield reportedly chose Stanford over Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama, Georgia 
and Miami (Fla.) and was influenced strongly by the school's Jan. 3 hiring of 
Dennis Green as head coach to replace Jack Elway.
