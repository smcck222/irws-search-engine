CHESLEY PETERSON; WWII ACE IN BOTH BRITISH AND U.S. FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chesley Peterson, who was booted out of the U.S. Army after he lied about his 
age but later became one of the most highly decorated flying aces in both Great 
Britain and the United States during World War II, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Air Force major general died Sunday in Riverside. He was 69 and had 
suffered heart and lung disease for three years, funeral home director John A. 
Lindquist said from Ogden, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was born in Salmon, Idaho, and attended Brigham Young University but 
quit at age 19. He forged a birth certificate to get into military pilot 
training in 1939, but was found out two months later and discharged. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, 
Peterson went to England and joined the Royal Air Force's elite Eagle Squadron, 
a group of foreign volunteers. Flying Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine 
Spitfires in battles with the German Luftwaffe, Peterson advanced to squadron 
commander at age 21 and colonel at 23. 
</P>
<P>
He kept the rank when he moved to the U.S. Army Air Corps to fly P-47 
Thunderbolts in 1943, becoming the corps' youngest colonel. 
</P>
<P>
In more than 200 combat missions, Peterson claimed nine kills and nine probable 
kills, twice parachuting from damaged Spitfires while with the RAF. In a single 
dogfight, on April 27, 1942, over northern France, he downed three Focke-Wulf 
190 German fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Airman magazine said Peterson is the only American fighter pilot to win both 
the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross and Britain's Distinguished Service Order, 
each country's second-highest military decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Lindquist, also a longtime friend, said Peterson did not like the way the Air 
Force was fighting in Vietnam and quit at age 49 rather than take a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson retired to Ogden, where his mother and sister lived, in 1970. For 
medical reasons he moved to an Air Force retirement village in Riverside last 
October and died at March Air Force Base Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife and a son and daughter.

FREDERICK W. WINTERBOTHAM; INTELLIGENCE EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederick W. Winterbotham, 92, a group captain who played a key role in 
exploiting broken German codes in World War II and wrote the best-selling 
memoir "The Ultra Secret." Winterbotham was a pilot in World War I, and in 1929 
was made head of aerial intelligence in MI-6, the British intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, he managed to befriend senior Nazi figures in Germany and gleaned 
information about the Luftwaffe. In 1939, he helped devise a vital new method 
of aerial reconnaissance photography. But his most important work was with 
"Enigma," the top-secret German code system that the British had managed to 
penetrate. Winterbotham's job was to get the information about "Enigma" to 
commanders in the field without revealing to the Germans that their code had 
been cracked. He worked out a system that was successful throughout the war and 
did not become public knowledge until the 1970s. His work made him a confidant 
of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. But he remained an unsung war hero, 
because the cracking of "Enigma" was considered so secret it was not revealed 
for 30 years after the war, when Winterbotham published "The Ultra Secret." In 
London on Sunday.

HAL DRAPER; SOCIALIST SCHOLAR, ORGANIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Draper, 75, a socialist scholar who founded the Center for Socialist 
History in Berkeley and whose writings were credited with inspiring the Free 
Speech Movement at UC Berkeley. Draper's political involvement began in the 
1930s when he became a leading organizer for the Young Peoples' Socialist 
League of a national strike against war. 
</P>
<P>
As editor of the radical periodical Labor Action, Draper and other socialists 
reported on revolts in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China. Draper's 
opposition to American and Soviet militarism drew some criticism from the Left. 
In 1964, Draper, who was working at the time as a librarian at UC Berkeley, 
gained notice for publication of "Berkeley: The New Student Revolt." In his 
book, Draper wrote in support of the Free Speech Movement. Draper also 
published a four-volume study of Marx and Engels' political theories. In

FINE ART OF WATCHING GORBACHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the most established Soviet experts tend to have tarnished credentials 
these days, because they could not tell five years ago where Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev was coming from or where he was going. But amateurs, as we now see, 
are no great improvement -- even if on Tuesday they did perform a service of 
sorts for the world. 
</P>
<P>
The amateurs not only measured the incredibly long shadow that the Soviet 
president has come to cast over the West but they also demonstrated that 
nowadays the merest rumor that Gorbachev has sneezed can make otherwise 
sensible nations reach for their fever thermometers. 
</P>
<P>
For decades the world was carefully taught that Moscow's Communists were so 
brutal and bull-headed that anyone who wanted to reform the party would have to 
shoot his way into it. That was not quite true. But even today, the word 
miracle is the only way that one of the better Soviet experts in America can 
explain how Gorbachev made it to the top of his party's apparatus where he 
could reach up and tug at the thread that may cause communism to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, many of the same experts who failed to predict the advent of 
Gorbachev have spent most of the years since he took office predicting that 
reforming the Soviet economy andthe Soviet society were both impossible and 
that he would soon be on his way either to retirement or to some leaf-raking 
position in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The Cable News Network, which arrived on the scene just a few years before 
Gorbachev, has played an important part in the use of television to teach 
people the world over not to believe everything they hear about Moscow. It 
helped that viewers could not only hear about Gorbachev but also see him doing 
things that the experts said could not be done. It also helped in recent months 
that they could see the people of East Germany peacefully dismantling a 
Communist government that the experts said could only be removed by force. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is not surprising that the same CNN showed the people of the West on 
Tuesday how much they now depend on Gorbachev to outline a future over which he 
actually has little or no control. CNN's report that Gorbachev might resign as 
Communist Party leader caused what the Wall Street Journal called a "frantic" 
scramble to buy American dollars and sell German marks. The White House also 
scrambled to find the meaning of it all. It is a useful reminder of the frailty 
of expertise, even among able amateurs.

While I sympathize with David Rothenberg, I am concerned that the conditions of 
his father's parole represent an injustice to all of the victims of violent 
crimes. What warrants such exceptional safeguards while numerous less 
newsworthy victims share his same fears? Above all, his father is a threat to 
only one person while there are many paroled rapists and robbers who are 
threats to all of society.

STATE OF UNION -- AND WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In most years, a U.S. President might touch base with key members of Congress 
before making surprise announcements in his State of the Union address. On 
Wednesday, President Bush called Mikhail S. Gorbachev before giving his first 
State of the Union speech. And in that address, Bush even worked in a political 
plug for the Soviet boss, pledging to support the movement toward democracy and 
economic opportunity there. 
</P>
<P>
How times are changing. Who can remember when dramatic events raging across the 
world have meant potential benefit for the state of the American union rather 
than fear and foreboding? 
</P>
<P>
Bush did the courtesy of telephoning Gorbachev to alert him that the White 
House now is prepared to negotiate a reduction of troop strengths in Europe far 
below any level previously proposed, down to 195,000 for each superpower. This 
must be welcome news for Gorbachev, who is eager to demonstrate to his critics 
that his reforms are paying dividends, and who is facing growing pressure from 
the emerging democratic governments in Eastern Europe to take his Soviet troops 
home. The proposed withdrawals provide good news for Americans, too. The sooner 
that conventional armed forces can be cut, the sooner the nation can begin to 
reap the fruits of any peace dividend -- the sort of benefits that did not 
appear in Bush's new budget on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the speech's start, Bush said he didn't intend to detail every new domestic 
initiative he plans in 1990. But then he ticked off his proposals pretty much 
like a laundry list. The general goals are good ones -- who can argue with 
proper child care or getting youths off drugs? -- but Bush pushed it by 
claiming that his budget provides adequate funding for those programs. It 
simply does not. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of those domestic needs is scarcely diminished by the dramatic 
intensity of the changing U.S.-Soviet relationship. But somehow all 
contemporary history right now is overshadowed by the astonishing and 
unpredictable developments in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The Bush 
telephone call to Moscow was vivid confirmation of the extreme importance of 
close and mutually informative superpower communications. Perhaps Bush wished 
only to reach out and touch someone. One hopes he succeeded.

SENDING WOMEN TO FRONT LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one in the debate on women in combat seems to be addressing the most crucial 
issues -- love, sex, and family. Simply put, in times of desperate danger, most 
soldiers will place the safety of their loved ones ahead of the welfare of 
their comrades or the execution of their military duties. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively gentle discipline exercized by the U.S. Army has no chance of 
compelling a soldier to value the lives of comrades more than the life of a 
woman he hopes to marry. Nor will the darker side of relations between the 
sexes be suppressed. Sexual harassment, jealousy and infidelity will have 
lethal consequences. Whatever the actual frequency of fragging was in Vietnam, 
it would be dwarfed in the unisex infantry. 
</P>
<P>
All this had become clear to the Israelis when, in 1948, during the War of 
Independence, women were removed from combat duty. Let's learn from them and 
not make the blue-collar people who make up most of the Army pay for the 
fantasies of the intellectual class.

WASHINGTON WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: NEWCOMERS TO CONGRESS ARE CUSTOMARILY ADVISED, 'TO GET ALONG, YOU 
HAVE TO GO ALONG.' THAT'S NEVER BEEN THE STYLE OF MAXINE WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SMITH, Martin Smith is political editor of the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next year is likely a period of considerable adjustment both for the state 
Legislature and Congress. California's state lawmakers will have to learn to 
get along without Maxine Waters. The House of Representatives will have to 
learn to get along with her. 
</P>
<P>
Washington faces the bigger challenge. newcomers to Congress are customarily 
advised, "To get along, you have to go along." Going along with something she 
doesn't like has never been the style of Maxine Waters. 
</P>
<P>
During her 14 years in the Assembly, she has made a name for herself as one of 
the Legislature's most acerbic and outspoken members. She has become legendary 
for her tough advocacy of her causes -- women's issues, programs for the poor 
and minorities and divestiture of investments in South Africa, among others -- 
and her willingness to upbraid her opponents. Despite all the enemies that she 
has created, the force of her personality has made her an important power 
within the lower house, where she serves as Democratic Caucus chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, she's had her eye on the House and has been waiting for 
Rep. Augustus Hawkins, 82, to retire. He announced this week that he will not 
run again, having served in Congress since 1962. She wasted no time in saying 
that she would not seek re-election but would run for Hawkins' seat instead. 
She's a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
This all comes as bad news to a number of Californians already serving in 
Congress. Some prize collegiality, and dislike the combative style she brings 
to lawmaking. Others have previously engaged in disputes with her. There's even 
been some speculation in the state Capitol that Reps. Howard Berman and Henry 
Waxman may privately encourage someone within the district to oppose her in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Delegation insiders say, however, that a stop-Waters enterprise is unlikely, 
especially one initiated by West Los Angeles Democrats Berman and Waxman. It 
would be greeted with such disfavor by the Watts voters Waters seeks to 
represent that it would be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
She'll have her own major adjustment problems after the election. Some 
observers, both in Sacramento and Washington, privately say that she's making a 
mistake in moving to Congress, where she will be only one of 435 House members. 
In the Assembly, she is one of 80 members. Moreover, she'll be a newcomer in a 
House where seniority continues to count for much and where advancement is less 
rapid than in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she is likely to have an early impact in Washington, especially 
within the House Black Caucus, where the "get-along, go-along" spirit remains 
strong with some important members. She's sure to challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
Her absence in Sacramento will be felt by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, whom 
she has served as a top lieutenant -- and sometimes as his liberal conscience. 
As a tough advocate, she has been known to push Brown to move more resolutely 
on programs than he might otherwise have been willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, her departure offers pluses as well as minuses for Brown. One 
admiring Capitol Democrat said that Brown will miss Waters' presence but 
acknowledges many others won't. Brown may have made a mistake in naming her 
caucus chairwoman, a post that calls for someone more skilled at reconciling 
various forces. 
</P>
<P>
That's an understatement. At various times, she's taken on governors, 
presidential candidates and legislators of both parties. She has threatened to 
hold up budgets unless she gets answers to her questions, and she can show a 
particular scorn for Democrats whom she regards as limousine liberals lacking 
any understanding of the problems of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Brown has been spared her tongue. But at least he was chewed-out in 
private.

IS BEGGING PROTECTED SPEECH OR A BLIGHT ON PUBLIC SPACE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you think no new folly can make city life more menacing, some moral 
exhibitionist, wielding judicial power and reeking of liberal self-approval, 
makes matters worse. Meet Judge Leonard Sand. 
</P>
<P>
He recently ruled that the ban on panhandling in New York City's subway 
stations violates the First Amendment because begging is "informative and 
persuasive speech." This latest trauma to the First Amendment suggests that any 
peaceful (although intrusive, annoying and even coercive) conduct that is 
accompanied by speech is constitutionally protected. This is especially so, 
says Sand with a flourish of sentimentality, if the speaker is among the 
unwashed. 
</P>
<P>
First Amendment rights do not vary inversely with the affluence of individuals. 
There is nothing novel about "time, place and manner" restrictions on speech 
(e.g., no sound trucks near hospitals). Yet the city's attempt to limit one of 
the unpleasant, even alarming, experiences of subway travel is deemed 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what society owes in compassionate help to street people is, 
surely, severable from the question of what right the community has to protect 
a minimally civilized ambience in public spaces. However, that second question 
is rarely even reached because all today's controversies are cast as conflicts 
between individual rights and a cold, alien government. 
</P>
<P>
The community, dismissed as a fiction without standing, deteriorates through 
the "broken window" dynamic. James Q. Wilson of UCLA says that if a broken 
window in a building goes unrepaired, the remaining windows will be broken, 
because an unrepaired window sends a message that no one cares. Disorder and 
crime are linked in a developmental sequence. Disorder atomizes communities, 
dissolving the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility. 
</P>
<P>
Beggars -- many of them deranged by alcohol or other drugs or mental illness, 
and dangerous in fact or appearance -- are human "broken windows." But in the 
social analysis spawned by liberalism, the individual is the only reality and 
the community is an abstraction without claims. Judges like Sand are dangerous 
-- physically dangerous -- because their actions feed the anarchic impulse 
toward violent self-help. Harried, frightened citizens have begun assaulting, 
in one instance killing, beggars who, in an atmosphere of pervasive menace, 
are, or appear to nervous people as, dangerous.

The following is an excerpt from the testimony of White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu before the Committee of National Inquiry on the Cartagena 
Incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman: Whose idea was it that the President should go to Colombia? 
</P>
<P>
Sununu: At the time, everyone. It beat meeting the Russians in a hurricane in 
the Mediterranean. However, since the unfortunate incident with the President, 
I've checked with my staff and the Cabinet and they all assure me they were 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
C: There must have been some reason. 
</P>
<P>
S: Of course. To show solidarity with President Barco in his war against the 
Colombian drug lords. To show how close he and Bush are. 
</P>
<P>
C: Did you accomplish that goal at least? 
</P>
<P>
S: Absolutely. The two Presidents spent more than 72 hours alone with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
C: You mean while they were handcuffed together? 
</P>
<P>
S: Yes, but they had a chance to talk each time the tape was taken off their 
mouths so they could eat. 
</P>
<P>
C: Every day there are bombings and shootings in Colombia. Didn't you expect a 
security problem? 
</P>
<P>
S: Certainly. But the Army was busy cleaning the streets in Panama. The CIA has 
its hands full updating "Who's Who in Eastern Europe." The Colombians refused 
to let us deploy the Navy, so the Secret Service had to handle it alone. Nobody 
expected that President Bush would sneak out at midnight for a round of 
horseshoes, but that's the kind of wild and crazy guy he is. 
</P>
<P>
C: And that's when he and President Barco were kidnaped by the Medellin cartel? 
</P>
<P>
S: The perpetrators were Colombians dressed like the Filipino stewards from the 
White House Mess. 
</P>
<P>
C: When was President Quayle notified? 
</P>
<P>
S: Correction. He never actually became President. 
</P>
<P>
C: But he decided to offer himself in exchange . . . . 
</P>
<P>
S: That's another misunderstanding. The secretary of defense ordered him to go. 
</P>
<P>
C: On what basis?

IS BEGGING PROTECTED SPEECH OR A BLIGHT ON PUBLIC SPACE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The homeless plaintiffs argued that begging is a form of speech -- a request 
for help. The Metropolitan Transit Authority responded that begging is not 
speech at all, but rather an act -- and an offensive one to many subway riders. 
Judge Leonard Sand agreed with the beggars: 
</P>
<P>
"The simple request for money by a beggar or panhandler cannot but remind the 
passer-by that people in the city live in poverty and often lack the essentials 
for survival. Even the beggar sitting in Grand Central Station with a tin cup 
at his feet conveys the message that he and others like him are in need. While 
often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic, begging is unmistakably 
informative and persuasive speech." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Sand cited Supreme Court cases which had concluded that organized 
charities which solicit for others do have a First Amendment right to send 
their message, and he reasoned that there can be no constitutional distinction 
drawn between the more refined entreaties of the professional fund-raiser and 
the "more personal, emotionally charged" face-to-face importuning of the subway 
beggar. 
</P>
<P>
The judge recognized that begging is disturbing to many citizens. But he 
rejected the argument of the Transit Authority that government has the power to 
protect its citizens from being forced to confront the cruel reality of 
homelessness and poverty. The principal effect of the prohibition against 
begging, he said, was to keep "a public problem involving human beings out of 
sight and therefore out of mind." Having ruled that beggars have a 
constitutional right to ask for help, the judge then went on to offer some 
protection to those who are solicited. Obviously, any citizen has a right to 
say no to a beggar's plea. The citizen also has a right to be protected from 
repeatedly being harassed, accosted, touched or threatened by a beggar -- or 
anyone else, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
The judge made it plain that government does have the power to enact reasonable 
rules regulating the manner and locations in which begging may take place. 
Indeed, existing criminal statutes already prohibit most of the legally 
objectionable aspects of aggressive begging. The problem with the New York 
subway regulation was that it was an absolute ban to all begging: It prohibited 
even the most polite request directed at the most willing giver. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Sand's decision -- if it is eventually upheld -- may become a Magna Carta 
for our poorest citizens. He wrote: "A true test of one's commitment to 
constitutional principles is the extent to which recognition is given to the 
rights of those in our midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and 
least welcome. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court -- which in recent years has 
received flunking grades when it comes to protecting the poor and the 
disenfranchised -- will understand that freedom of speech includes the right of 
the homeless to beg for sustenance on the subway, as surely as it includes the 
right of corporate executives to lobby for tax breaks in Congress.

INVESTMENT BANKER JOINS L.A. GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. Gear has named Kevin J. Ventrudo, a 31-year-old investment banker, to 
succeed a chief financial officer who walked out in December after the company 
moved to cut his seven-figure salary. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear, the nation's No. 3 sneaker manufacturer, said it wants to tap 
Ventrudo's expertise in arranging financing for growing firms. Ventrudo was a 
vice president in the Los Angeles investment banking division of Merrill Lynch 
Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
As chief financial officer, he replaces Elliott J. Horowitz, whose pay for 1989 
will total about $5 million under a contract that tied much of his compensation 
to the company's pretax earnings. Horowitz, who was with L.A. Gear for five 
years, quit when the booming firm offered him a contract that would have 
substantially reduced his pay by changing the compensation formula. 
</P>
<P>
Gil N. Schwartzberg, chief administrative officer of the Marina del Rey 
company, said that Ventrudo's annual pay would be in the range of $200,000 to 
$400,000 and that he also would be eligible for stock options. Unlike Horowitz, 
Ventrudo will not hold the additional title of executive vice president. 
Instead, he will report to Schwartzberg, one of L.A. Gear's two remaining 
executive vice presidents beneath Robert Y. Greenberg, the company's chairman 
and president. 
</P>
<P>
One of Ventrudo's likely missions is to calm concerns among some investors that 
L.A. Gear is on the verge of stumbling after growing in six years from a small 
shoelace company to a business with annual revenue of $617 million. The 
company's stock, the biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange last year, 
has slid since hovering in the mid-$40s in November. 
</P>
<P>
In trading Wednesday, L.A. Gear's shares fell 75 cents to close at $24.125. 
</P>
<P>
At Merrill Lynch, Ventrudo was involved in managing a secondary offering of 
L.A. Gear stock. The Manhattan Beach resident holds a bachelor's degree in 
economics from Yale University and an MBA from Stanford University. STUART

Seagate Technology Inc.: Second-quarter profit more than quadrupled to $35.8 
million on sales of $690.1 million, more than double the same period of 1988, 
the Scotts Valley, Calif., maker of computer hard disk drives said. The 1989 
results included the operations of Imprimis Technology, which Seagate acquired 
Oct. 2, 1989. Goodwill and other intangibles of about $114 million were 
recorded from the acquisition.

General Dynamics Corp.: The St. Louis aerospace company said 1989 net income 
totaled $293.1 million, down slightly from the $294 million reported in 1988. 
Revenue rose 5% to a record $10 billion. The company attributed the earnings 
decline in part on increased interest expenses and higher development costs for 
the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter.

MAGAZINES: CORPORATE AMERICA FINALLY GETS THE ECOLOGICAL MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is the environmental hoopla resonating through the halls of American business 
"mere corporate ecobabble intended to placate the latest group of 
special-interest loonies?" 
</P>
<P>
Not according to Fortune magazine. In its Feb. 12 issue, Fortune finds that 
corporate America has finally caught on to what the "loonies" have said all 
along: that people don't like seeing their planet assaulted and their children 
poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
In a cover story on business and environmentalism, Associate Editor David 
Kirkpatrick rounds up a passel of big businessmen who agree that "the 1990s 
will be the decade of the environment." Quite a few of them say they are 
willing to do something to clean up that environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows there are a lot of (terrible) polluters," Kirkpatrick said by 
telephone. "What people didn't know -- what I really didn't know -- is that 
companies are doing as much as they are." 
</P>
<P>
One of the companies changing its environmental perspective is Du Pont, which 
has announced that it will voluntarily stop production of ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000, thus forfeiting its leading share 
of the $750-million-a-year CFC industry. 
</P>
<P>
Another example of corporate good citizenship is the Virginia-based Applied 
Energy Services' commitment to planting millions of dollars worth of 
oxygen-producing trees in Guatemala to compensate for a coal-fired plant it 
built in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick also describes McDonald's laudable plastic packaging recycling 
program. He points out that the program arose because the corporation was 
"faced with growing protests over the volume of waste it generates." 
</P>
<P>
Few of the corporations featured in the piece, however, concede that their 
environmental consciousness was raised by 20 years of prodding by activists. 
Some even come across as condescending and self-righteous. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman, for example, urges corporations to take 
such visionary steps as having a continuing dialogue with environmentalists and 
making environmental issues part of decisions. "Do these things," he says 
"because they are the right thing to do, not because somebody forces you to do 
them." 
</P>
<P>
That from a company the National Resources Defense Council accused last year of 
slashing conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, skeptics argue that much of the current corporate interest in 
environmentalism often manifests itself in better public relations rather than 
better anti-pollution policies. Kirkpatrick concedes that "some of the most 
egregious polluters today are now pointing out that they are environmentalists 
too." But he is convinced that for the most part, corporations have decided 
that cleaning up their acts is good business. 
</P>
<P>
While the big environmental groups and big business are schmoozing and dealing, 
though, more localized gadflys remain a nagging problem for big business, 
Fortune points out. As one public relations consultant who specializes in 
"corporate environmental strategy" puts it: "The grass-roots groups are 
concerned about the value of their homes and the health of their children. That 
means they are relentless. In general, unlike the mainstream environmental 
groups, they are not interested in compromise or mediation." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these more uncompromising environmentalists are described in the Feb. 5 
Newsweek, in an article titled "Trying to Take Back the Planet." Naturally, the 
picture from the grass-roots perspective looks a bit different than it does 
from that of the "Big 10" environmental groups that are working with industry, 
and turning the ballyhooed 20th anniversary of Earth Day into, according to 
Fortune, "a veritable biz-fest." 
</P>
<P>
As veteran environmentalist David Brower tells Newsweek reporter Jennifer 
Foote: "Nature is diversified and our movement needs to be. Besides, if we all 
got together and became one efficient organization, Exxon would buy us with 
petty cash." 
</P>
<P>
The global warming of interest to environmental stories is not letting up. Time 
replaced its 1989 Man of the Year cover with a portrait of the Earth. And 
rumors are circulating on the East Coast that the Fortune cover story forced 
the competing Forbes Magazine to pull its own environmental cover. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Forbes ran a widely discussed story headlined: "The Global Warming 
Panic: A Classic Case of Overreaction." The latest story was rumored to have a 
similar theme. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes does have another environmental cover story in the works, said Lawrence 
Minard at Forbes. But he scoffed at the notion that the magazine pulled it in 
reaction to Fortune's story, which he called "weak." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playboy Plays Its Trump Card in March 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of covers. . . . It is a curious statistical fact that only once in 
each decade has Playboy magazine featured a man on its cover. In the '60s, it 
was Peter Sellers. In the '70s it was Burt Reynolds. In the '80s it was Steve 
Martin. And just three issues into this new decade, Playboy has plopped Donald 
Trump on its March cover. 
</P>
<P>
As the subject of the Playboy interview, Trump discusses everything from Leona 
Helmsley -- "She's out of her mind. . . . truly evil human being" to Spy 
magazine, which insists on referring to Trump as "a short-fingered vulgarian." 
(Spy, he says, "is a piece of garbage.") 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the interview by Glenn Plaskin include Trump's view that Japan is 
laughing at America's business stupidity and a rundown of just what Trump would 
do if he were elected President (not that he's interested, mind you). 
</P>
<P>
Also interesting is his opinion that every successful person, including Mother 
Teresa, Jesus Christ, and the Pope have "far greater egos than you will ever 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what readers might suspect, though, Playboy did not, according to 
Managing Editor Jonathan Black, create its cover to appease the sizable ego of 
the Trumpster. Rather, someone at the magazine apparently thinks there are 
readers who find Trump sexy.

JACK SMITH: DESPITE THE GAME, THE DAY WAS WELL-ORCHESTRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
No thanks to the Denver Broncos, but it turned out to be a Super Sunday after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
American culture's great new religious holiday had arrived under a cloud. Weeks 
before, unknowingly, I had agreed to speak for the American Field Service at 2 
p.m. that day in Torrance High School Auditorium. The service is a group that 
supports exchange students in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Too late I discovered that my scheduled talk would coincide exactly with the 
kickoff of the Super Bowl. I phoned the woman who had talked me into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize," I asked her, "that your program is on Super Sunday?" 
</P>
<P>
"I know it now," she said dismally. 
</P>
<P>
That was before the Rams and the 49ers met in the playoffs. I told her that if 
the Rams won, and went on to the Super Bowl, nobody would show up for my talk. 
Certainly not any men. 
</P>
<P>
She said, "I just hope the Rams lose." 
</P>
<P>
I considered that grossly unpatriotic, even though the Rams are from Anaheim, 
not Los Angeles. But I felt the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Rams didn't make it. I was agreeably surprised to see about 
250 people in my audience, including quite a few men. After the introduction, I 
took the microphone at precisely 2:18 p.m., by my watch. That was the 
advertised kickoff time. 
</P>
<P>
I went boldly on. I excused the men, but nobody got up and left. I had taken 
the Broncos and 14 points. I offered to make the same bet with anyone in the 
audience. I got no takers. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over my wife and I drove to our older son's home, in Mar Vista. We 
were scheduled to attend the Master Chorale at the Music Center that evening 
with him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, it was still halftime when we arrived. The game was a blowout. The 
49ers were leading, 27-3. I watched the second half with diminishing interest 
as Denver quarterback John Elway threw two interceptions and fumbled and 
otherwise failed to distinguish himself. 
</P>
<P>
We dined on lox and bagels. My wife and I had won a Super Sunday home-delivered 
deli lunch, but had had it delivered to our son's home instead because of my 
conflicting commitment. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 we left for the Music Center in two cars -- our son, his wife, and their 
three children -- Alison, 12, Casey, 9, and Trevor, 7. I wasn't too sure how 
the children would behave. Trevor is a caution. Just the day before he had 
smashed his nose on a tree limb. 
</P>
<P>
Before the concert we were guests of Bill Mann, a friend of my son's, in The 
Founders room. We were all on our good behavior, as I always am under that 
portrait of Dorothy Buffum Chandler. I didn't even wander into the women's 
restroom by mistake, as I had on two previous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was splendid. John Currie conducted the Sinfonia Orchestra with 
great style, and the choral work was magnificent. They opened with Pergolesi's 
"Magnificat," then sang Morten Lauridsen's "Mid-Winter Songs on Poems by Robert 
Graves." I noticed that my granddaughter was following the words on her 
program: 
</P>
<P>
"She then, like snow in a dark night, 
</P>
<P>
"Fell secretly. And the world waked." 
</P>
<P>
Her brothers were exemplary. At intermission they had Cokes in The Founders. 
When we returned to the auditorium Trevor said, "They took away the piano." He 
had been paying closer attention than we had. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of Haydn's "Mass in Time of War" our son's friend spirited the two 
older children out of the auditorium and took them backstage. I kept my fingers 
crossed. Suddenly we heard a crash. It was definitely backstage. "Oh, my!" my 
wife sighed. "I hope that wasn't Casey." That was probably a sexist remark, 
since it implied that boys are more likely to crash into things than girls. But 
I myself suspected that Casey had banged into the piano. 
</P>
<P>
After the curtain calls, the children were returned to us in time for the 
reception in the Grand Hall, where Maestro Currie appeared, resplendent in 
tails, and also Lauridsen, the young composer, euphoric over the performance of 
his music. There had been a crash backstage, but Casey was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a Super Sunday. But there was no joy in Denver; mighty Elway had 
struck out.

professional baseball, falsely pledged that its users could simulate being a

"just has lists of uniform numbers" -- insufficient information because 
baseball reference books aren't based on the numbers, Kanaga said. Nintendo had

STEPNER'S LOW PROFILE STIRS GRUMBLING BY SOME CRITICS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since filling the new post of San Diego city architect in September, 1988, Mike 
Stepner has kept a decidedly low profile, concentrating more on getting his 
fledgling department organized than on public displays of power. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight months since Stepner was relieved of doing double duty as 
assistant planning director, he has concentrated on assembling a staff of 25 
and assigning it to key areas: urban design, historic preservation, downtown 
planning and special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Although most observers agree that the job of creating the new city architect's 
office from scratch was monumental, some critics believe it's time for Stepner 
to exercise his power, to stand up and be counted when he has an opinion on 
important issues. Already, he appears to have missed a few opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example was last fall, when the City Council approved a high-rise 
apartment tower at State Street and Broadway downtown. The council delayed a 
decision for months before selecting the Huntington, which is bulkier and 
several stories taller than a close runner-up known as 900 State. Both projects 
were well designed. 
</P>
<P>
"In public, he said both were legitimate, architecturally speaking," said 
Councilman Bob Filner, who favored the second-place plan. "But it was my 
impression that his department favored 900 State but was unwilling to say that 
as clearly in public as they would in private." 
</P>
<P>
"I did favor that project," Stepner acknowledges, "but after all the teeth 
gnashing that went on, my considered opinion was that the council was making a 
mountain out of a molehill. They needed to get on with a decision. Either 
project would work. Each needed refinements." 
</P>
<P>
Although Stepner seems to prefer a low profile, Filner and others would like to 
hear his opinions loud and clear. After all, he's often one of the only 
licensed architects on hand -- Councilman Ron Roberts is the other -- when 
important design decisions are made at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had assumed that we would have a design review of major issues that come to 
council," Filner said. "I don't think we're getting that, and I don't know 
why." 
</P>
<P>
Stepner stands by his philosophy, saying he doesn't want to be regarded as 
"some kind of Lone Ranger who rides in to save the day." Instead of such 
immediate flashes of glory, he wants to gradually arrange his priorities, then 
work within the system to realize them. 
</P>
<P>
Part his long-range impact won't be measurable until several complex new 
planning ordinances and guidelines now in the works have been adopted and had 
some effect on San Diego's diverse communities. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his new position, Stepner got off to a soft start on another matter: 
historic preservation. Last year, the council voted against a panel's 
recommendation to create a special historic district to help save several 
Egyptian-flavored Art Deco buildings on Park Boulevard near University Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of such a district came after the owner of the best of the buildings, 
a courtyard apartment complex, hired workers to jackhammer away its delicate 
period ornamentation. Some speculate he wanted to mar the building so it would 
no longer be worthy of a historic designation that might prevent him from 
developing the property with a new, larger building. 
</P>
<P>
(The building has since been sold, and a new owner has vowed to restore it.) 
</P>
<P>
"The district was voted in by the city's Historic Site Board," said Carol 
Landsman, a member of the North Park Community Planning Group and chairwoman of 
the Community Planners Committee, which includes representatives from several 
of the city's community planning groups. Landsman thinks the council's "no" 
vote partly reflects Stepner's performance. "That's a fairly negative 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
But, on this issue, too, Stepner stands by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been handled differently if we'd had more time. One thing was 
overlooked by the council. Those buildings aren't just important as objects, 
but as threads of a neighborhood fabric. Their scale and character added 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he's not counting out an Egyptian historic district. He thinks the idea 
could be revived. 
</P>
<P>
Besides more vocal support for historic preservation, Landsman would like to 
see city funds allocated to surveying and designating historic buildings. Right 
now, such work is done with federal Community Development Block Grant funds, 
which are scarce or, in some years, not available for such work. Landsman and 
other preservationists fear that more fine period buildings will be disfigured 
or destroyed if they aren't soon recognized by the city. 
</P>
<P>
But historic preservation is only one of several important neighborhood issues 
Stepner faces. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more perplexing is the problem of preserving neighborhood flavor 
and scale in the face of new -- and often more intense -- development. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinance being drafted in an attempt to improve the quality of new 
apartment and condominium buildings may indicate Stepner's overall approach to 
architecture citywide. Due for council consideration later this year, the 
ordinance has gradually moved away from specifying elements of architectural 
style and toward controlling broader issues of bulk, height and land use. 
</P>
<P>
Architects, including the members of a citizens Architectural Advisory 
Committee formed by Ken Kellogg to advise Stepner, are applauding this trend, 
while community leaders such as Landsman would like even tighter architectural 
controls on new projects, especially in neighborhoods with a period flavor. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming year, Stepner will have a role in perhaps the most 
significant project of his career: a new downtown civic center. 
</P>
<P>
A design competition has been organized by the city manager's office with help 
from Stepner and his staff. Last fall, Don Hansen, then president of the local 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects, sent a letter to Stepner 
expressing the organization's fear that good design will be secondary to 
economic considerations. Under the "design/develop" competition format being 
used, more than 200 architects who have already submitted their qualifications 
will be narrowed to a list of 18 or 20. 
</P>
<P>
In some kind of mating dance, developers will team with architects. Then each 
of the five or so teams deemed strongest -- in development experience and 
design ability -- will receive $100,000 to create detailed civic center design 
and construction packages. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen credits Stepner with pressing to make design a higher priority, making 
the selection of a "short list" of architects the first event, rather than the 
choice of a developer. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansen and other local architects believe the kind of open, 
architecture-only competition that led to Escondido's impressive new City Hall 
would have been feasible for San Diego's civic center, even if the project were 
several times larger. 
</P>
<P>
Stepner sides with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I failed was in convincing the AIA that we are going with this 
competition process because the city feels it'll get a better project." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some impatience with Stepner's low profile, most insiders have faith in 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's on the verge of stepping forward with leadership," said architect 
David Thompson, president of the local AIA chapter and one of Stepner's more 
vocal critics in the past. "Probably more than anything, I'm disappointed he 
hasn't organized his role faster." 
</P>
<P>
"In time, I would expect that, between his own actions and those of his staff, 
there would be a stronger presence felt throughout the system," said Councilman 
Roberts, who approves of Stepner's concentration on getting organized instead 
of speaking out. "Quite frankly, I think he's shown some good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: Two homes share "Home of the Year" honors from San Diego 
Home/Garden magazine: a 1912 house designed by William Hebbard, restored under 
the direction of architect Bill Hayer, and a contemporary La Costa house 
designed by Randy Robbins and Thomas Elliott of the Austin Hansen Group. The 
houses, and winners of five "Awards of Excellence," can be seen in the February 
issue. . . . Architect Michael Graves' Aventine project in La Jolla recently 
received a satellite dish atop its Hyatt Hotel, visible from Interstate 5. 
Alexey Griforieff, the project architect for Graves' office, called it an 
"unfortunate addition," and said the architects could have concealed it within 
the hotel's arched roof had they known about it during design.

LEGAL VIEW: NEGLIGENCE IS EMOTIONAL ISSUE IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is every parent's worst nightmare. A son or daughter is playing outside near 
the street. Suddenly, you hear a screech of tires, a crash. A speeding car has 
jumped the curb and hit your child. You rush outside and find him unconscious, 
bleeding. You take him to the hospital, but even when he recovers, you never 
forget the moment. The trauma haunts you, leaving you nervous, emotionally 
upset, in need of intensive therapy. 
</P>
<P>
This hypothetical scenario is not only a nightmare for parents, it has plagued 
judges and lawyers for decades as they have tried to determine the legal 
liability of a negligent driver who causes an auto accident. Should that person 
be made to compensate the parent or other relatives and friends for the 
emotional distress arising from the accident? 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the California Supreme Court decided a landmark case, Dillon vs. Legg, 
in which it ruled that a mother who witnessed the death of her child in an auto 
accident may recover from the negligent driver for her emotional distress, even 
though the mother was not in any danger at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Before that case, California refused to award damages for emotional distress or 
shock resulting from danger or injury to another. 
</P>
<P>
In creating the new law, the court focused its analysis on the "foreseeability" 
of the emotional injury. The court said it was foreseeable that a mother who 
was standing next to her son when he was struck by a negligently driven car 
would suffer emotional injuries, and that the driver, therefore, had a legal 
duty to the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, emotional distress is foreseeable in countless instances in which a 
third party is negligently injured. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a friend or an acquaintance may be traumatized after witnessing an 
accident. And parents will suffer emotional distress from a child's injury even 
if they did not witness the accident, whether they arrived on the scene a few 
moments later or simply heard about it by phone. 
</P>
<P>
There had to be limits on the possible recovery, so the Dillon court said 
judges should decide, on a case-by-case basis, what was reasonably foreseeable. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dillon case, the mother actually saw the accident happen and also 
suffered physical damage as a result of her emotional distress. The court noted 
that these were significant factors in finding a legal duty. Later court 
decisions expanded liability to cases in which the plaintiff was not present at 
the moment of impact and did not suffer physical symptoms of the emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the broadened liability involved a mother searching for her 
3-year-old son. She heard someone scream his name and realized that the child 
had fallen into a neighbor's pool. When she arrived on the scene, he was 
already being given cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Even though she was not 
present at the time of the accident, the court allowed her to sue the neighbor 
for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the legal name of this type of 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The law was clarified last April when the California Supreme Court -- in a case 
called Thing vs. La Chusa -- severely limited the types of cases in which 
recovery would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
In simple terms, and without explaining some of the legal technicalities, in 
order to win damages, the court said, a plaintiff must be closely related to 
the injury victim, be present at the scene and aware of the injury at the time 
it occurs, and suffer serious emotional distress beyond what a disinterested 
witness might suffer, and which is not an abnormal response. 
</P>
<P>
What this means for future cases is still open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
The court opted for a "bright line" legal rule to lessen uncertainty and moved 
away from the somewhat vague legal test of "reasonably foreseeable." At the 
same time, however, as the dissenting opinion noted, "it will deny recovery to 
victims whose injuries from the negligent acts of others are very real."

YOUR WHEELS: DEFECT INVESTIGATIONS AT RECORD HIGH IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The auto safety tally for 1989 has come in, and the news isn't particularly 
good for consumers. Last year, 6.7 million vehicles, including cars made by 
virtually every major producer, were recalled by manufacturers because of 
safety defects that needed correcting. 
</P>
<P>
The recalls included 1.7 million General Motors cars with sticking throttles, 
1.4 million Ford Escorts with defective seats, 500,000 Chryslers with rusty 
front-suspension parts, and 408,000 Toyota Camrys with problem seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration boasted that it opened 213 
defect investigations during 1989, a record in the 20-year history of the 
agency. Of the 6.7 million recalls, the agency claims that it influenced 77%. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics beg the question: Are cars safer because more investigations are 
being run, or do cars have more defects than ever? The numbers, critics say, 
show the public is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more defective vehicles out there," says Clarence Ditlow, executive 
director of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group in Washington. "In 
the 1980s, we had a record number of new models introduced, which are always 
prone to problems." 
</P>
<P>
Ditlow has harsh criticism for the federal safety administration, saying it has 
dropped important safety investigations and has imposed fewer recalls than in 
past years. 
</P>
<P>
But safety administration spokesmen defend their record and say a decline in 
recent years in the number of recalled vehicles could have resulted from higher 
quality in new automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been an authoritative national estimate of highway traffic 
deaths that result from safety defects. But academic studies have indicated 
that anywhere from 5% to 33% of the 50,000 highway fatalities each year can be 
blamed on defects, including worn-out tires and improperly maintained brakes. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the lowest estimates, several thousand highway deaths each year can be 
blamed on bad maintenance and defects, a toll that virtually all experts agree 
is simply too high to accept. 
</P>
<P>
Question: On a recent vacation to Colorado and Utah, I noticed that a Texaco 
station was selling premium No. 2 diesel fuel unleaded with an octane rating of 
88. I have never seen a premium or unleaded diesel fuel or one that is 
octane-rated. Can you explain that, please? -- P.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The station either had an erroneous sign or you misread a sign for 
gasoline and thought it was for diesel. Diesel fuel is a much more generic 
product than gasoline. It comes in a single grade, has few additives and 
carries no ratings for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
As you may know, gasoline octane is a measure of a fuel's ability to resist 
uncontrolled combustion inside the engine, a condition that can cause knocking 
or pinging. The higher the octane rating, the more controlled is the 
combustion. 
</P>
<P>
But diesel does not carry an octane rating, and if it did, it would be very 
low, because the whole idea with diesel is that you want very rapid burning. 
Diesel engines do not have spark plugs. Rather, they ignite their fuel by 
simple pressure and heat inside the combustion chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Diesel fuels do have something called a cetane rating, which is a measure of 
its combustion characteristics, but the rating is almost never posted at the 
pump. Diesel engines are not rated for a certain cetane in the same way that 
gasoline engines are rated for octane. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, diesel has few additives. One exception to that rule is an 
additive to retard gum formation during long-term storage.

We finally have a source for sealing wax, which several readers have asked 
about. Esther Tyrrell of El Monte says that Vroman's Bookstore, 695 E. Colorado 
Blvd., Pasadena, (818) 449-5320, carries a fabulous selection of sealing waxes 
in every color imaginable, even in gold, from as far away as Scotland; one 
stick costs about $2.

Bette Lynch of Glendora, who needed some Brunswick yarn to finish a sweater, 
might soon be a sweater girl again. Chloe Schwartz of Bellflower writes that

For Betts Waite of Ventura, who needed a quadruple-magnification round mirror 
with a stand, we have some magnificent news. Joy Forrester of Apple Valley 
writes that she ordered such a mirror with stand from a (free) catalogue put 
out by Comfortably Yours, 61 W. Hunter Ave., Maywood, N.J. 07607. Dorothy Libra 
of Torrance writes that the mirror can be obtained for about $20 from Magic 
Focus, 610 State St., P.O. Box 39, Augusta, Kan. 67010, telephone (316) 
775-2251. And Eleanor Gibbel of Beverly Hills came through with an interesting 
suggestion (assuming Waite wears bifocals): Reverse the glasses, so that the 
bifocal part is on top. This will magnify the vision and will still allow room 
to maneuver the tweezers.

YOUR COINS: SPECIAL BOOKS PAVE THE WAY TO KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Knowledge is the lifeblood of numismatics, and for the serious collector there 
is no such thing as too much knowledge. Talk to other collectors and to 
dealers, keep up with current periodicals and study the characteristics and 
peculiarities of particular coins. 
</P>
<P>
Another road to knowledge is through the wealth of numismatic literature that 
has been produced through the years. In addition to some of the standby 
reference books, such as A Guide Book of United States Coins by R.S. Yeoman or 
the Standard Catalogue of World Coins by Krause and Mishler, there are 
thousands of books on every aspect of numismatics. 
</P>
<P>
What brings this to mind is a letter and catalogue from Art Rubino of Fine 
Numismatic Books. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino writes: "I am a mail-order dealer in rare and out-of-print numismatic 
books and literature, as well as new books in this field. . . . Since a fine 
selection of books on coins and medals is virtually impossible to find, even in 
a large city, I believe that I can be of help to many collectors." 
</P>
<P>
Rubino says his catalogue contains more than 200 pages and is used as a 
reference source for current values for rare and out-of-print numismatic 
literature. The catalogue is reprinted and updated monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Sample listings include "Greek Imperial Countermarks. Studies in the Provincial 
Coinage of the Roman Empire" ($75); "The Coinage of Nepal" ($110); "Byzantine 
Coins and Their Values" ($96); "British Historical Medals 1760-1837" ($120); 
"Handbook of Islamic Coins" ($55); "The Mexican Revolutionary Coinage, 
1913-1916" ($70); "Coinage for Colonial Virginia" ($22), and "Counterfeiting in 
Colonial Connecticut" ($45). 
</P>
<P>
This, as I said, is just a sampling. The titles alone open up many new areas of 
collecting interest. 
</P>
<P>
Catalogues are $15 and are available from Fine Numismatic Books, P.O. Box 9712, 
Santa Fe, N.M. 87504; telephone (505) 982-8792.

Question: I have inherited 20,000 English half pennies (1967) and 4,000 English 
pennies. How can I best dispose of these coins? -- J.B.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: That's a tough one. I'm not sure your coins have much value, especially 
to collectors. You might contact some dealers in foreign coins or a coin 
exchange company such as Deak. Another possibility would be to check with the 
British trade office.

No Longer a Hogan, but Happy: Is revenge sweet? Ask Valerie Harper whose new 
CBS series "City" beat her old NBC show "The Hogan Family" on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Harper won a lawsuit against the "Hogan" producers after they fired her. But 
will Harper's ratings victory continue through the season? The "City" debut 
scored a 13.9 rating and drew a 21% share of the audience, barely edging out 
the Hogan clan, which scored a 13.8 rating and 20 share. Each rating point 
equals 921,000 households. BETH KLEID

Schaufuss Ousted From English Ballet: Noted Danish dancer Peter Schaufuss, 40, 
has been fired as artistic director of the English National Ballet, a post he 
has held since 1984. A National Ballet spokesman reached in London by telephone 
confirmed rumors that there had been problems between Schaufuss and the 
company's general administrator, Richard Jarman. 
</P>
<P>
"For sometime there has been a split there," said spokesman David Palmer. "But 
we've had two recent changes in the chairman of the board, and Pamela Lady 
Harlech has come in to straighten things out. Richard Jarman is still here, but 
his situation has got to be reviewed by the board too." Schaufuss was to dance 
in Southern California with members of the National Ballet at a March 11 AIDS 
benefit at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. BETH KLEID

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: INTAKE OF SOLUBLE FIBER IS IMPORTANT PART OF A PRUDENT, 
LOW-FAT DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The precise role of oat bran as a variable in lowering blood cholesterol is now 
a matter of public debate, but scientists have known for some time that soluble 
fiber isn't the cornerstone of cholesterol-lowering therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Research data has proven that soluble fiber intake, in general, and oat bran 
intake, in particular, when combined with a low-fat diet can influence 
cholesterol levels in the bloodstream. But consumers overlooked that connection 
and instead sprinkled oat bran over everything from pretzels to beer as a 
quick-fix solution to a more complicated problem. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy stimulated by the recently released Harvard study, however, may 
cause consumers to re-evaluate the placement of oat bran in the daily diet. At 
least that's what health experts hope. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard study supports what dietitians and others have said all along: "Oat 
bran is not a panacea . . . sprinkling it on cereals and other foods will not 
provide an adequate supply of the body's total fiber needs." 
</P>
<P>
What it does do, said one cholesterol expert, is prove that "You can't eat 
whatever you want and eat oat bran and expect to lower your cholesterol that 
much. It's best used as part of a prudent diet." 
</P>
<P>
According to the evidence, there has always been a wide assortment of foods, 
besides the much ballyhooed oat bran, and its recently touted cousin, rice 
bran, that lower blood cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Adding 1 1/2 cups of cooked dried beans to the diets of men with elevated blood 
cholesterol has been shown to produce as much as a 19% decrease in serum 
cholesterol; barley also has been shown to have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
And, as recently as last week, a new study from the University of Florida 
suggested that eating a grapefruit every day, along with other pectin-rich 
foods, could have a potential cholesterol-reducing effect and thus reduce one's 
risk for heart disease. In this trial, 15 grams of grapefruit pectin, which is 
found just below the skin in the white interior peel, caused the blood 
cholesterol level of the volunteers to decline about 8% -- without dietary 
change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Environmental Nutrition, a diet and health newsletter, a study of 
five adults in Scotland demonstrated a 10% to 20% reduction in serum 
cholesterol when seven ounces of carrots were added to the diet. One cup of 
chopped cabbage or onions has a similar effect, the newsletter reported last 
July. Psyllium, currently marketed as the laxative Metamucil, also has the 
added benefit of lowering blood cholesterol, when given in regular daily doses. 
</P>
<P>
But, none of these results is especially surprising to scientists, said Jo Ann 
Hattner, clinical nutritionist, Department of Dietetics, Stanford University 
Medical Center. She reports that when studying individuals with an elevated 
blood cholesterol level, usually above 215 milligrams per deciliter, a 20% 
decrease is to be expected when dietary regimens are followed. 
</P>
<P>
It's more difficult to expect dramatic results when the individuals are healthy 
to begin with, she said, as in the case of a Harvard study where the volunteers 
were dietitians with healthy diets and an average blood cholesterol level of 
186 milligrams per deciliter. The inclusion of oat bran, she explained, proves 
most effective when the participants are hypercholesterolemics, people who 
already have a high blood cholesterol level. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems (with oat bran) has been that it was probably overused, 
and overused in a way that was no longer medically beneficial," said Hattner. 
"As a source of fiber in the diet it is just like any other source. . . . 
People who were eating oat bran were not also lowering fat in their diet. They 
were just adding oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
"Clinically, the people who respond the best (to oat bran supplementation 
therapy) are those with a higher blood cholesterol level -- at least 75% above 
the acceptable cholesterol," she said, explaining that the body has a built-in 
regulation system so that if a person already has a low cholesterol level it 
probably won't be influenced much with diet. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that dietitians have always focused on the total fiber content of 
the diet and have encouraged consumers to select from a wide assortment of 
fibrous foods, including grains, cereals, fruits and vegetables to meet the 
recommended daily goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, she said, consumers should seek to include as much as 35 to 50 grams 
of fiber each day, although 25 grams is a good beginning goal for those with 
very low intakes. (The American Dietetic Assn. recommends intakes below 50 
grams to avoid any adverse effects such as decreased mineral absorption.) And, 
the Harvard study pointed out, anyone who makes a drastic change in the amount 
of fiber they eat each day is likely to experience some gastrointestinal 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," Hattner said, "you have to find those sources that you do tolerate 
and you have to start slowly. You can use bran as part of it but you need to 
learn to ask for beans, lentils, whole grains and fruits." When increasing the 
fiber content of the diet is it important to also include at least a quart of 
fluids to prevent constipation. 
</P>
<P>
But there are numerous other reasons to increase fiber in the diet. Lowering 
cholesterol, Hattner said, "just happens to be one of them. It aids in 
digestion, promotes feelings of fullness and, therefore, serves as a diet aid, 
and it has a role in preventing colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"As you increase your fiber (intake), you change the type of foods you eat and 
you ultimately decrease the fats," she said, adding that ". . . fiber is one of 
the most important components of the diet, but it's not ever a good idea to 
single out just one source. Choose from a variety of sources." 
</P>
<P>
Some other suggestions from Hattner: eat raw or slightly steamed vegetables; 
select 100% whole grain cereals, then top with another high-fiber cereal; 
choose whole grains breads; eat popcorn for snacks. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other ways of increasing total fiber in the diet from the 
American Dietetic Assn. Have bean dip and salsa instead of a sour cream-based 
dip. This will contribute two grams of fiber, compared with none for the creamy 
dip. Eat green peas instead of green beans. This provides 7.7 grams fiber vs. 
1.7, and whole-wheat toast with one-half pat butter and one teaspoon jam offers 
about 3.2 grams fiber compared to white with one pat butter, at 0.8 grams. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources of soluble fiber, the type that dissolves to form gel-like 
substances during digestions, are oat products, legumes such as dried beans and 
peas, barley and fruits such as apples, citrus, prunes and figs. 
</P>
<P>
Water-insoluble fibers, those that cannot be broken down by the digestive 
process and thus add bulk to the intestines, reducing risk of colon cancer, 
include: whole grain breads and cereals, wheat bran and the skins of fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a list from the National Cancer Institute of some foods and the amount 
of fiber they provide: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whole grain cereals: All Bran with extra fiber, 13 grams; Fiber One, 12 
grams.

ABOUT WINE: GALLO, BOLLA SEEK TO UPGRADE IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your perception of a product is linked directly to your past experience with 
it, which is why it's hard for a company to change its image from moderate 
quality to super premium. 
</P>
<P>
You can see it all around you. The best minds on Madison Avenue and other ad 
streets write copy seeking to upgrade the image of everything from soap to 
automobiles. Yet no matter how appealing the message is, it's still mighty hard 
for people to accept the fact that something once mundane has gone uptown. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is Gallo, the world's largest winery and a producer since the 
1930s of everyday, basic, down-to-earth table wines. For the last two decades, 
Gallo has tried to persuade the American public that its premium products are 
really much better than jug quality. And many of Gallo's wines truly are 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Gallo ad campaign speaks of one of the company's latest wines in 
glowing terms, and you think the ad is for this wine. But no. Gallo is not 
selling wine here. They're selling image. The last line of the commercial is, 
"It'll change the way you think about Gallo." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that Gallo's image ought to be perceived on a higher plane by many 
Americans than it now is. But old habits and images change slowly and many 
people still equate Gallo with inexpensive wine (which they continue to make). 
</P>
<P>
Another case: Bolla Soave, one of the greatest success stories in wine 
marketing history. At one point a decade ago, a huge amount of this Italian 
white wine was being imported to the United States (more than a half million 
cases), and a lot of people frankly didn't know if Bolla was the producer and 
Soave was the region it came from or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The Soave from the house of Bolla sold so well partly because it was clean and 
innocuous and also because it was inexpensive, less than $5 in most every 
location in the country and a lot less in some of the bombers. And the other 
Bolla wines, such as Valpolicella and Bardolino, were pleasant, simple wines 
you'd order if there was nothing else to drink. No pretense or price-tag 
overkill. 
</P>
<P>
I met the other day with Francesco Bolla, great-grandson of Abele Bolla, 
founder of the company in 1883 and son of the late Franco Bolla. We tasted a 
new line of wines that makes me change the way I think about Bolla. The problem 
is: will Americans buy the idea of a $10 Soave? 
</P>
<P>
I asked that question, somewhat rhetorically, to Francesco, and he smiled a 
knowing smile and said the idea is, he admits, a bit curious in view of the 
fact that Soave is a fairly light-bodied, crisp and fast-finishing wine that 
requires little thought to order or consume. And that has meant that virtually 
every bottle sold in the United States in the last couple of decades has been 
sold at $7 or less. Most of them, a lot less. 
</P>
<P>
The new Bolla Soave is called Castellaro, from the 1988 vintage, and it is 
produced from grapes off a single vineyard -- a vineyard Bolla feels produces a 
unique wine. And indeed it is unique, with a marvelous spiciness weaving in and 
out of a flowery, perfume-y base aroma. The crispness is not austere, though, 
and a lovely textured finish means the wine works well with lighter foods. 
</P>
<P>
Made since 1977, Castellaro now is being sent to this country, and it will test 
the American public's ability to spot a winner even though it has on the label 
that word Soave. (The word Soave is, however, in small print, so it may not be 
noticed by some.) 
</P>
<P>
I compare this wine favorably to the new Arneis wines coming in from Italy, 
wines that sell for $12 to $16 a bottle and also offer a spiciness. (Two 
attractive ones are from Ceretto and Giacosa.) Considering the Castellaro will 
be discounted a bit, it's recommended for those folks seeking an alternative to 
the current wave of heavily oaked Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
More impressive in some ways is another new Bolla wine, the 1986 Creso, a bold 
and brassy red wine. And it is this wine that Francesco and his family (not to 
mention their U.S. marketing agents, Brown-Foreman) are banking will change the 
way you think about Bolla. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting to the wine, I must admit there are three drawbacks for me about 
it, and over the course of the three hours with Bolla at dinner, I kept going 
back to the Castellaro and sipping it, and realizing what a joy it was. Bolla 
was amused by this, figuring I'd simply swoon for the rosso. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Creso is, indeed, a spectacular wine when you consider what it is. 
It is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine (60%) from the Veneto, a region whose 
history is not with Cabernet; it is 30% Corvina, the main grape of the 
light-bodied Valpolicella, and 10% late-harvested Valpolicella grapes. 
</P>
<P>
The wine, aged in French oak barrels (a new trick for many Italian producers of 
top quality vino da tavola), exhibits a fairly rich, quite ripe, cooked cherry 
and blackberry aroma with hints of the toastiness from the barrels. The finish 
is pure silk and lovely to drink now, but it should age handsomely for a number 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
My reservations about this wine are somewhat technical in nature, but they 
gnawed at me on my long drive home that night, and I couldn't reconcile them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The aroma has a definite trace of late harvest character, though late 
harvest wine makes up only 10% of the blend. This aroma is, for me, a little 
too much -- almost like someone tried to make a wine "impressive" rather than 
letting the natural ripeness of the fruit do all the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How long will it age? I'm guessing the wine will be wonderful in two to 
four more years, but since this is the first vintage, we have no clue to its 
age worthiness. Which leads to the biggest drawback of all: price. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At a suggested retail price of $22, this wine is at the upper-echelon of 
Italian red wines -- and it's the first pop out of the winery. It's excellent 
wine, but I wonder if the public will be curious enough to buy it when they see 
it on a restaurant wine list at $50 or so. 
</P>
<P>
A Bolla third wine of interest, a 1986 Jago, which is a single-vineyard 
Valpolicella, is more delicate in nature than the Creso, with a faint anise 
quality. I liked the Jago, but felt the $10 price was slightly high, 
considering what's out there in the marketplace today. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, one sip of Creso will prove the point that a winery once 
considered a producer of merely passable red and white wine can step into the 
major leagues and hit to left. And the other two wines are able pinch-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 Taja (Mahler-Bresse) ($6) -- Here is another find in 
dark red wine. Taja is a red from Jumilla, Spain, made entirely from the 
Monastrel grape variety. The aroma is an interesting combination of the old 
(faintly oxidized) and the new (deep fruit and concentrated mid-palate). It's a 
simple, one-dimensional yet rich wine that goes well with a plate of pasta in 
tomato sauce.

EXPERTS DIVIDED OVER THE BENEFITS OF OAT BRAN; 
</P>
<P>
CHOLESTEROL: CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC DATA MEAN THAT THE CONTROVERSY MAY BE WITH 
US A WHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Consumers could have a hard time sifting through the mushy confusion of the oat 
bran controversy that erupted last week when the New England Journal of 
Medicine reported that a Harvard University study had all but debunked former 
scientific conclusions of oat bran's cholesterol-lowering effect. 
</P>
<P>
For the American Heart Assn., it is not so much a question of oats and oat bran 
as it is a concern about fat in the diet. Other health authorities see the 
problem as one of overall dietary management. 
</P>
<P>
In light of conflicting scientific data and disagreement among scientists 
themselves, relief from confusion over the oat bran controversy may not be 
immediate. But here are comments from health experts that may provide a better 
perspective on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The effectiveness of a diet that lowers plasma cholesterol and consequently of 
reducing one of the risks of heart attack and stroke, is dependent upon proper 
choice of foods relative to fat and cholesterol content. A basic principle is 
that food products from sea and land animal sources contain cholesterol. 
Cholesterol is not found in any plant sources. The average person should limit 
their fat intake to less than 30% of their total calories." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Policy statement from the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We 're confident in the science that relates to grains being an important part 
of the diet, and that includes research on both soluble and insoluble fiber. We 
believe in the research that says that a diet high in fiber and low in fat can 
reduce the risks of chronic diseases. Since oat bran is a good source of 
soluble fiber, the extensive data available continues to support benefits of 
this type of fiber. A diet low in fat and high fiber is recommended by numerous 
health organizations, and ready to eat cereals can easily be part of the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make claims that oat bran reduces cholesterol levels. We do, however, 
point out that oat bran can be part of the low fat high fiber diet that we were 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nancy Roach, manager of corporate publicity, Kellogg Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"The study that was done on oat bran (Harvard University study) was not 
definitive on the basis that the subjects had unusually low cholesterol levels 
for the population of this country to begin with. When you run a study 
measuring metabolic end point and start with a desirable end point, it's hard 
to show improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have cholesterol levels higher than acceptable as far as risk 
factors go, have been shown to benefit when their diet includes fiber that can 
be solubilized in the intestine. Under these conditions, you'll find that 
pectin, guar gum and, in some studies, oat bran, have properties that have been 
shown to lower cholesterol levels, especially in people with elevated 
cholesterol levels. I know it's disturbing in nutritional studies to find 
inconsistencies, but they do occur. That's why it's necessary to look at the 
conditions under which the studies were done. You have to look at the 
population, the diet itself -- was it already low in cholesterol? -- and many 
other factors." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dr. Sheldon Reiser, research leader of Carbohydrate Nutrition Laboratory, 
Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, United States Department of 
Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we should be focusing on lowering saturated fat in the 
diet. There are many other foods besides oat bran that have also shown 
cholesterol-lowering effects. There are lots of studies that show that foods 
high in soluble fiber do lower cholesterol. Americans still need more fiber in 
the diet, but it doesn't have to come from one source only. Beans, legumes, 
peas, fruits, vegetables, carrots, broccoli are excellent sources of good fiber 
of the type that lowers cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Evelyn Tribole R.D., American Dietetic Assn. spokesperson 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We should keep in mind that an increase in dietary fiber, especially from 
grains, has been demonstrated, without question, to be helpful in 
gastrointestinal functions. There is also preliminary evidence that a diet 
higher in water soluble fibers, when substituted for fats, are associated with 
lower risk of colon cancer. The public should not think that by sprinkling oats 
on muffins that are high in fat it is going to help. The primary goal should be 
to reduce saturated fat and dietary cholesterol even if it means a major change 
in the diet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- William L. Haskell Ph.D., associate professor of medicine, Stanford 
University 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I have not read the paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, but have 
heard the reviews. I concur with the information that there has been a hype 
over what a specific bran might or might not do. Soluble fibers can be 
important in lowering blood cholesterol, but large amounts have to be consumed 
to have a significant effect. And I think those concerned with overall diet and 
health should not look to a single food or a single kind of food as a remedy. 
Instead they should follow the dietary principles we have all been told do work 
-- and that is to eat a varied diet. People think it is boring because it is so 
practical, but it makes very good sense for the population as a whole. If, 
however, you have to follow a therapeutic diet, a few oat bran muffins is not 
going to do the trick." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Helene Swenerton Ph.D., nutritionist, Cooperative Extention, UC Davis 
Department of Nutrition 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I am in disagreement with the conclusion (Harvard University study reported in 
New England Journal of Medicine). In addition to the study design factors, the 
fat intake was not carefully controlled. This in itself makes it difficult to 
interpret. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Since the University of Kentucky's first scientific article in 1981 showing 
the cholesterol-lowering effects of oat bran, seven additional published 
studies and three unpublished studies have documented the statistically 
significant cholesterol-lowering effect of oat bran. . . . An important factor 
to consider is that the new study included dietitians and hospital employees of 
Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital who would be more likely to have an enhanced 
awareness of changes in their diet. While it was a placebo controlled study, 18 
of 20 subjects recognized when they were on a high fiber supplement as opposed 
to a low-fiber supplement. This, in itself, indicated that the study was not 
successfully blinded. In addition, it is important to consider the fat intake 
during the Harvard study. Caloric intake during the oat bran period consisted 
of 35.4% fat. This was significantly higher than the fat intake during the low 
fiber period, which was 30%. In other words, when research subjects were on the 
oat bran they increased their fat intake by 18%. That is a large increase." 
</P>
<P>
 -- James W. Anderson M.D., Metabolic Research Group, University of Kentucky 
Medical Center 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"If you eat oat bran and still take in butter, cream and other fats, it won't 
do the trick to lower cholesterol. You can get good soluble fiber and cut down 
on total fat and calories with foods other than just oat bran. If you eat a 
diet high in fiber, especially soluble fiber, such as oat bran and other good 
soluble fiber foods, but also reduce fat and cholesterol, and include some form 
of exercise in your daily regimen, that would make sense. Unfortunately people 
like to hang on to a panacea. There are no magic cures."

Angeles.

BACK TO BASICS: SELECTING CORRECT KITCHEN TOOLS SIMPLIFIES DEALING WITH CITRUS

Any job is easier when using the right tools. Here are some that are helpful 
when working with lemons. 
</P>
<P>
Before using these implements, wash and dry the fruit. The term zest refers 
only to the outer yellow part of the lemon peel, not to the more bitter white 
portion. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the zesting tool, all the implements featured in this 
column are included in the Sunkist Lemon-Aid Kit. To purchase a kit, send $3.50 
(includes tax and postage) to P.O. Box 4587, Overland Park, Kan. 66204. Allow 
four to six weeks for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Individual tools may also be found in most housewares departments and cookware 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Grater -- Remove the outer colored layer of the lemon peel by making quick 
downward strokes on a citrus grater (Step 1), with fine, sharp rasp surfaces. 
Measure the grated zest lightly into a spoon, but do not pack. For easy 
cleanup, place the grater on a sheet of wax paper before beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Zester -- This handy tool has five small holes with cutting edges on the end of 
a blade fastened to a plastic or wooden handle. By pulling the tool down the 
surface of the lemon (Step 2), you can cut fine strands of zest. The cutting 
action of the zester releases the citrus oil, so it is a good idea to work over 
the dish being flavored. 
</P>
<P>
Twister -- Narrow strips or spirals of peel are fast and easy to make with this 
tool. Simply pull it down the side of the lemon (Step 3) or cut in a circular 
fashion around the fruit. Remember that giving the peel a twist before it is 
used releases the fragrant lemon oils. 
</P>
<P>
Faucet -- Also called a lemon spout. Without cutting off the top of the lemon, 
twist this handy device (Step 4) into the stem end until the plastic threads 
are covered. Open the top and squeeze the fruit to extract juice. Snap the cap 
closed for storage. 
</P>
<P>
Juicer -- Lemons yield more juice by bringing them to room temperature. Before 
juicing, roll the fruit on a hard surface with the palm of your hand (Step 5) 
to break the juice sacs. Cut the lemons in half crosswise and ream out the 
juice on a hand or electric juicer.

CULINARY SOS: TREAT GETS NAME FROM TOLL HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I am planning to write a small article on the history of the Toll 
House Cookie for our inter-office newsletter, since everyone is familiar with 
that popular treat. Do you have any information on the subject? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SUSAN: According to the Nestle Co., the trademarked cookie got its name 
from an old toll house on the outskirts of Whitman, Mass. Built in 1709 at the 
halfway point between Boston and New Bedford, Mass., the toll house became a 
haven for weary travelers who stopped for food, drink and rest while they 
waited for a change of horses.

In 1930, the old toll house was purchased by a couple named Wakefield (their 
first name has been lost), who turned the house into the Toll House Inn. Mrs. 
Wakefield experimented with a Colonial cookie called the butter drop do, but 
added tiny bits of semisweet chocolate to the cookie dough, half expecting them 
to melt. Instead, the bits of chocolate held their shape, softening just 
slightly to a creamy texture. Mrs. Wakefield named her discovery the Toll House 
Cookie. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with Mrs. Wakefield's permission, Nestle put the recipe on the wrapper 
of their semisweet chocolate bar. As popularity grew, Nestle, seeking ways to 
make cooking with bits of chocolate easier, started producing a scored 
chocolate bar accompanied by a chopper for cutting the chocolate into small 
bits. In 1939, Nestle offered little pieces of chocolate in ready-to-use 
packages, calling the product Semi-Sweet Real Chocolate Morsels.

THE BUTCHER: A LOT OF GOOD EATING IN VEAL BREAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A letter from a reader recently suggested a new twist on an old subject that 
sounded like something worth sharing -- veal breast. "For years," she writes, 
"I have been buying breast of veal, cutting a pocket along the bone, stuffing 
the pocket with any number of various stuffings, sewing it up and braising the 
roast. Veal breast has provided a lot of good eating for our family. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, my market had veal breast at 99 cents a pound. They were huge -- at 
least 24 or more inches long. I realized what I had been purchasing before were 
pieces. This was such a good buy I bought the whole thing. Then I got home and 
wondered what to do. So I did some 'cutting up in the kitchen.' 
</P>
<P>
"I cut along the bone, removing the spare ribs with the skirt meat attached. I 
wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in the freezer. I stuffed and rolled 
the boneless breast -- Italian-style with hazelnuts. It was marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
"Weeks later after two days of thawing them in the refrigerator, I marinated 
the ribs in a mixture of oil, wine, garlic, rosemary, parsley, salt and pepper. 
My husband barbecued them and they were delicious. I've never heard of 'veal 
spare ribs,' but that's what we had and they were superb. Do other people 
barbecue veal ribs?" 
</P>
<P>
You bet they do. Some of the best barbecue I've ever tasted was a Barbecue Veal 
Breast created for a special tasting of wine and barbecue by Roland Hinni, 
chef, at Benton's Steak &amp; Chop House at the Westin Crown Center in Kansas 
City. I was there as one of the judges for the Royal National Barbecue Contest. 
The purpose of the tasting was to show off a wide range of the best barbecue 
tastes and then pair them with various wines. Hinni decided to depart from the 
barbecue tradition and his barbecue veal breast was the result. 
</P>
<P>
There are those (I am one of them) who would argue that it is not true barbecue 
since it is not cooked long and slow over coals. I would classify it as a 
"barbesauce" but it is delicious. It goes, I found, wonderfully well with 
Fetzer's new light-fresh Red Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>

hours, basting occasionally with pan juices. Add more stock if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
When meat is cooked, transfer to carving board and allow to cool to room 
temperature. When cool (not before or meat will fall apart), remove string and 
carve in 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange slices on heat-proof serving dish into 
which pan juices have been poured. Reheat at 300 degrees. Makes 6 to 8 
servings.

PROSCIUTTO IS BACK FROM THE BAN; 
</P>

GOURMET FOODS: THIS ITALIAN HAM IS AS DIFFERENT FROM MOST AMERICAN IMITATIONS 
AS FRENCH CHAMPAGNE IS FROM MOST SPARKLING WINES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Except for the tall, shuttered windows, the plant doesn't look that much 
different than any other moderately successful agricultural concern. But then 
again, the windows are the key. 
</P>
<P>
For it is these windows that open and shut to capture the cool, dry air that 
blows in from the surrounding hills of the Po River Valley and permits the 
small miracle that is the creation of top-quality prosciutto di Parma. 
</P>
<P>
"In our hams, we have only three ingredients," says Ettore Grisendi, the plant 
manager, "swine from our fields, salt from the sea and the weather." 
</P>
<P>
He hesitates and, not without pride, adds "And the experience and skill of our 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
After an absence of more than 20 years, true Italian prosciutto -- an uncooked, 
dry-cured ham -- is once again available in the United States. Banned in 1967, 
after reported outbreaks of African swine flu fever in Italy, it was recently 
reapproved by the USDA for import. 
</P>
<P>
Though there are scores of different prosciutti made in Italy currently, the 
prosciutto made in this region just outside Parma is the only type available in 
the United States. It is certainly the best-known. Many cookbooks, in fact, 
refer to prosciutto generically as "Parma ham." 
</P>
<P>
So why is true prosciutto di Parma different? 
</P>
<P>
It begins with the pigs, fed partly on the whey left over from the making of 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. They must be raised in the strictly delimited 
region, killed at one of only 350 slaughterhouses and processed at one of 214 
plants. A little quick math reveals that, with a total regional output of just 
more than 8 million hams a year, this breaks down to roughly 150 hams per plant 
per day -- making it a truly artisanal product. 
</P>
<P>
It takes this kind of hands-on work to produce the hams. The secret of a great 
prosciutto's delicate sweetness and buttery texture lies -- as much as any one 
factor -- in the restrained use of salt during the curing process. 
</P>
<P>
The cure takes anywhere from 300 days (the minimum for Italian products) to 400 
days (the USDA-mandated minimum for American sale). The hams are, in fact, 
individually branded with the date processing began. The longer a ham ages, the 
more buttery the texture -- up to a point. Most prosciutto is sold at its best 
from 400 to 500 days old. Only exceptionally big hams, with high percentages of 
fat, can take extended aging, and most of those are claimed at the 
slaughterhouse by important restaurants. A 25-pound prosciutto (the legal 
minimum weight, post-production, is 12 pounds), aged more than 700 days is the 
equivalent of drinking an old Burgundy from an exceptional year. 
</P>
<P>
Serve prosciutto sliced as thinly as possible, accompanied only by figs, melons 
and perhaps shards of true Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. A luxury product 
(Italian prosciutto is selling for around $20 per pound, as opposed to $7 or 
more for domestic), a simple presentation is best. Allow approximately 2 ounces 
(about four slices) per person. 
</P>
<P>
Most recipes that call for prosciutto use only small amounts -- such as a 
stuffing for tortellini in brodo (soup) -- so you can use any scraps left over 
from trimming the slices. Leftover fat will also add a distinctive note to any 
sauteed dishes. Also, if your deli owner orders bone-in prosciutto (it is also 
imported with the bone already removed), ask him to save you the bone. Add it 
to a soup or a pot of beans. It can be reused six or seven times. 
</P>
<P>
When buying prosciutto, look for size and age. What you do not look for is 
brand names. There aren't any. The self-regulating consorzio of ham producers 
has inspectors who check not only plant sanitation and production, but quality 
as well. Hams that do not live up to their standards (about 7% to 8%) are 
discarded. After all, the reputation of an entire industry is at stake, for all 
prosciutto from Parma is labeled only as prosciutto di Parma. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, that says it all. 
</P>
<P>
This is one dressy recipe for prosciutto. I'm using it because it is very much 
like a dish served to me for a very special dinner in the Piemontese town of 
Alba by Sra. Giacosa at her inn, Cascina Reine. Serve it with a good crusty 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
INVOLTINI DI ASPARAGI E PROSCIUTTO (Asparagus and Prosciutto Bundles) 
</P>
<P>
18 choice, thick, fresh asparagus spears 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound Fontina cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound prosciutto, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
Trim, peel, rinse and cook asparagus until tender-crisp. Do not overcook. Drain 
asparagus. Set aside to cool. 
</P>
<P>
Cut cheese into thin slices, using swivel-action vegetable peeler or 
cheese-slicing tool. It doesn't matter if slices are irregular, as long as they 
are fairly even in thickness. Divide slices into 6 equal portions. 
</P>
<P>
Divide prosciutto into 6 equal portions. 
</P>
<P>
Take 3 asparagus and place 1 prosciutto slice under them. Take all but 2 slices 
of cheese from 1 portion of cheese and place it between asparagus stalks. Top 
with 1 1/2 teaspoons butter. Wrap asparagus, using remaining slices from 1 
portion prosciutto. Do not worry if wrap is not perfectly neat, as long as it 
is fairly even in thickness, not too bunched up in spots. Repeat to make 5 more 
bundles. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange bundles in single layer in lightly buttered bake-and-serve pan without 
overlapping. Criss cross 2 slices cheese over each bundle. Dot with remaining 3 
tablespoons butter. 
</P>
<P>
Place pan on top rack of oven and bake at 400 degrees 20 minutes until cheese 
is melted and lightly browned. Remove from oven and let stand several minutes 
before serving. Transfer to serving plates and baste with pan juices. Makes 6 
servings.

MICROWAVE: MOIST AND CREAMY OMELETS IN A FRACTION OF THE NORMAL COOKING TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moist, creamy omelets can be made in the microwave. The best are those made 
with two eggs (one serving) or four eggs (two servings). Larger omelets are 
difficult to handle and won't cook evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few other points to bear in mind if you're to succeed when 
microwaving omelets: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't salt plain omelets before you cook them because you'll toughen the 
eggs. Salt is beaten into the whites for puffy omelets because it helps to 
stabilize them and keep them from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For plain omelets, use glass ovenware or glass ceramic skillet of the exact 
size called for. 
</P>
<P>
To hide the microwave omelet's pale exterior, top with a colorful sauce. 
Omelets don't brown in the microwave and browning dishes aren't practical for 
the omelets because, among other reasons, they take too long to heat. 
</P>
<P>
PLAIN, OR FRENCH, OMELET 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt, about 
</P>
<P>
Dash white pepper 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs briskly with fork until frothy. Melt butter in wax-paper-covered, 
microwave-safe 5 1/2-inch glass ovenware or glass ceramic skillet by 
microwaving on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds. Tilt skillet to coat bottom 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Pour beaten eggs into skillet and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 1 
minute. With rubber spatula, draw partially set edges toward center and tilt 
skillet so uncooked portions flow underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds until omelet is just set and 
top is creamy. Season with salt and white pepper, loosen omelet with spatula, 
fold over on itself and turn out onto warm plate. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Top with favorite cheese, tomato or mushroom sauce. To fill omelet, spoon 
1/3 cup room-temperature minced cooked meat or sausage, boned and flaked fish 
or shellfish, or sauteed mushrooms, onions or sweet peppers onto omelet just 
before folding and turning out. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
Omelet For Two: Prepare as directed, using 4 eggs and 1 tablespoon butter in 
8-inch skillet. Microwave 2 1/2 to 3 minutes as recipe directs, drawing edges 
toward center every minute. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper 
before filling and folding. Turntable will help this large omelet cook more 
evenly. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Fines Herbes Omelet: Add 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh chives, 1/4 teaspoon minced 
fresh chervil and 1/8 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon (or dash of each dried 
herb) to melted butter before adding 2 beaten eggs. Microwave as directed. For 
4-egg omelet, double quantity of herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheese Omelet: Prepare 4-egg omelet as directed. Fifteen seconds before cooking 
is completed, sprinkle with 1/3 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar or Gruyere 
cheese and finish microwaving. Other cheese choices: 2 to 3 ounces soft ripened 
cheese such as Boursin, Brie, chevre, mascarpone or semisoft cheese such as 
crumbled feta, shredded Muenster or mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
The following fluffy five-minute miracle won't collapse when you cut into it. A 
turntable will make the omelet rise more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
SOUFFLE OMELET 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs, separated, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons cold water 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon white pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Briskly beat egg yolks and water with fork and set aside. In separate bowl, 
beat whites until frothy. Add salt, white pepper and cream of tartar and beat 
to soft peaks. Fold gently into yolk mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in wax-paper covered, microwave-safe 1 1/2-quart-round casserole 
(about 2 inches deep) by microwaving on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds. 
Tilt casserole to coat sides with butter. 
</P>
<P>
Pour egg mixture into casserole, smooth top lightly and microwave, uncovered, 
on MEDIUM (50% power) 4 to 4 1/2 minutes until puffed and just set, rotating 
omelet 180 degrees at half time if not using turntable. Loosen omelet with 
spatula, divide in half, using 2 forks, and ease onto warmed plates. Makes 2 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To fill omelet, before turning out, crease center of omelet with spatula, 
top half with 1/3 cup room-temperature minced cooked meat or sausage, boned and 
flaked fish or shellfish, or sauteed mushrooms, onions or sweet peppers. Fold, 
lift from casserole and divide in 2. Because folded puffy omelets do not hold 
much filling, alternate method is to spread turned-out omelet with filling, 
then halve. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

BLOCK ACTS TO EASE TENSION WITH BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday that he has advised his deputies against 
taking "enforcement action in minor incidents" in black neighborhoods because 
of "heightened tensions" after a Jan. 23 incident in which a deputy fatally 
shot a member of the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Sheriff's Department has produced a 15-minute video on the Nation of 
Islam that Block said will be shown to all personnel. The video is designed to 
educate deputies about the Nation of Islam and its goals, sheriff's officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One community activist called the moves "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
One of the main messages in the video, which is narrated by Assistant Sheriff 
Jerry Harper, is that "the avowed goals of their organization (Nation of Islam) 
in some ways are in common with the goals of the Sheriff's Department and law 
enforcement in general." 
</P>
<P>
"Their intention is to get young black men and women out of gangs and to keep 
them off drugs," Harper says in the video, "and to the extent they divert young 
people from drugs, gangs and crime, we support that effort." 
</P>
<P>
Block said in an interview -- his first public statement on the controversial 
incident -- that "the video was made for deputies . . . to make sure they 
understand we are not at war with the Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want a high tension level because in that kind of environment 
terrible things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Block defended the actions of deputies involved in the traffic stop that 
led to the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Some deputies have complained privately that Block did not move quickly enough 
to come to their defense, a source who asked not to be named said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Incident 
</P>
<P>
Block said deputies were being provided with details of the incident in which 
Nation member Oliver Beasley was killed and "have been made aware of the 
tensions in the (black) community and encouraged to proceed accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
"That means if I were a deputy in that particular community at this time I 
would probably avoid taking some enforcement action in minor incidents that 
might otherwise have caused me to take some action," Block said. "That is the 
message going out." 
</P>
<P>
Block did not define what type of incident would be considered "minor" or what 
exactly is meant by avoiding "enforcement action." 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Doug McClure elaborated by saying "that doesn't mean that law 
enforcement action will not be taken when that action is deemed appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"It does mean, when men and women of the department have contact with members 
of the community," McClure said, "that they be aware that what otherwise might 
be a minor kind of incident could easily escalate into something major." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how formally word of Block's advisory was being conveyed 
throughout the department. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Assn. for the Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs said union 
officials did not yet know enough to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad, a spokesman for the Nation's headquarters in 
Chicago, declined to comment on the department's action until he could "hear 
more about what all this really means." 
</P>
<P>
But the news was welcomed by local black community leaders including Danny 
Bakewell, head of the activist group Brotherhood Crusade, which has been 
instrumental in arranging a recent series of meetings between Nation members 
and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is what can happen when people of like minds sit down in a 
rational environment and meet each other and understand each other," Bakewell 
said. "For the first time I and others were willing to stand up and say we're 
not willing to isolate the Muslims and label them as some deranged and 
hysterical group of people that did not have the respect of the black 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bakewell applauded the department's action, calling it 
"unprecedented," he said that "what we need now is to have those kinds of 
messages and videos given out without the caveat of high tensions." 
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in some segments of the black community since the fatal 
shooting, which occurred after a deputy and a trainee stopped a car in the 
unincorporated Athens area south of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grabbed From Behind 
</P>
<P>
The deputies contend the shooting occurred after several men came out of a 
nearby apartment building and grabbed them from behind in chokeholds. 
</P>
<P>
When the trainee had his weapon taken from him, he drew a backup handgun and 
fired five shots. The driver of the vehicle, David Hartley, 18, was wounded in 
the shoulder and Beasley, 27, was fatally shot in the head. An autopsy report 
was unavailable Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Block strongly defended the actions of the deputy and the trainee. 
</P>
<P>
"The individuals who caused this situation to escalate and culminate in the 
tragic way that it did have to accept responsibility for its outcome," Block 
said, "not the deputies who were there and doing their job and placed in a 
situation where they feared for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Block said sheriff's officials will continue to hold meetings with 
community activists and Nation of Islam leaders "in the spirit of trying to 
prevent a reoccurrence of bloodshed and violence, and further confrontations."

1ST 'BEEG MAK' ATTACK LEAVES MOSCOW AGOG 
</P>

<P>
When the doors swung open Wednesday at the first McDonald's restaurant in the 
Soviet Union, thousands of Muscovites poured in to sip "milk cocktails" and 
taste their first "Beeg Mak Gamburgers," picking them apart to marvel at the 
fixin's. 
</P>
<P>
Some expressed wonder at the speedy service -- "only an hour in line" -- while 
others heralded the event as the first evidence that President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average 
Muscovite. 
</P>
<P>
Although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures, 
the arrival of the fast-food chain here -- 14 years after a Canadian McDonald's 
official broached the idea with Soviet officials at the 1976 Montreal Olympics 
-- was without doubt a major event. 
</P>
<P>
Most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it, even though some of them gave 
the Big Mac sandwich a mixed review. 
</P>
<P>
"It tasted very, I would say, unusual," Lubov Sereda, 45, said with a smile. 
"Everything was very soft and mild." 
</P>
<P>
"But those strawberry milk cocktails, well. . . ," her husband put in, flashing 
a thumbs-up sign. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very interesting, that gamburger," Zvetlana Generotova, 25, said, 
leaving with a large paper bag filled with take-out food, also a new concept 
here. "I certainly want my family to try it, at least once." 
</P>
<P>
Russians say "gamburger" because they pronounce Western words that begin with 
"h" as though they begin with "g." 
</P>
<P>
Another customer, Victor Kunyasev, said: "Well, my wife makes better food. But 
it was nice, a good place to take a break and grab a bite to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Some reported waiting up to 1 hour and 45 minutes to be served, but most did 
not seem to mind. In honor of the grand opening, a brigade of workers 
distributed McDonald's flags and pins; entertainers performed on the accordion 
and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the Soviet hammer and 
sickle. 
</P>
<P>
The world's largest McDonald's, with 27 cash registers and a seating capacity 
of 900, brings to Moscow not only hamburgers, french fries and shakes (called 
"milk cocktails" here), but also a living lesson in Western-style marketing. 
</P>
<P>
At training sessions before opening day, cashiers were taught the importance of 
greeting customers cheerfully, of saying "please" and "thank you" -- all of 
which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service 
at most of Moscow's dingy state cafes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very different from anything I've ever done before," cashier Larissa 
Lebedeva said. Lebedeva, 25, who formerly worked as deputy director of a small 
food store, said that "to be this polite and to have everything this clean is 
new for the workers as well as for the customers." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Yahel, from McDonald's in Atlanta, who helped train the 630 Soviet workers, 
said the Soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of 
the world, new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviet workers had never tasted a Western-style hamburger. They 
practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and 
different colored poker chips in place of onions, tomatoes and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is definitely a different world," Yahel said. "Our food and 
our standards -- it's all new. For example, we had to teach our employees that 
when there were still crumbs on the counter, it needed to be wiped off again." 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Soviet workers trained for a matter of days, the four Soviet 
managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs. They 
graduated from the Canadian Institute of Hamburgerology. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow McDonald's will be open for 12 hours a day beginning at 10 a.m. and 
will be able, they say, to serve more than 15,000 customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, though, it stayed open an extra two hours and served a McDonald's 
record 30,000 meals. The previous record for opening-day transactions was 9,100 
in Budapest, Hungary, and the previous record sales for a single day was 14,000 
in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
There is a brass plaque near the entrance that announces, "Soviet Rubles Only." 
Virtually every other foreign firm that has come into the Soviet Union in 
recent years accepts only hard currencies, meaning that it caters primarily to 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's prices are high compared to the state restaurants, where a large 
meal seldom costs more than a ruble. The Big Mac costs 3.75 rubles, or about $5 
at the official exchange rate, and dinner out for the family can come to two 
days' wages for the average Soviet worker. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's employees are paid 1.50 rubles an hour, with a chance for an 
increase of up to 50 kopecks in three months' time. The staff was chosen from 
25,000 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian and American officials who have helped train the Soviet personnel know 
that the allure of working for a Western firm was a drawing factor, but they 
nonetheless expect a 20% turnover rate, twice their normal average. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's invested $50 million in setting up the restaurant and a food 
processing plant in a Moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties 
to sesame-seed buns. Soviet farmers, who are supplying most of the products, 
have been given special training and disease-resistant seed for potatoes and 
cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
The extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much 
as 25% of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all of the planning, some shortages still affect the operation. Coffee 
is not on the menu, for example, because supplies cannot be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture agreement between McDonald's of Canada and the Moscow City 
Council calls for 20 restaurants, though there is no timetable or even a 
definite plan for when or where the second McDonald's will open. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas 
of Russian Orthodox churches, it will be a sign that capitalism is making real 
inroads in the Communist capital? McDonald's officials say it is not a question 
that worries them or their Soviet counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't many ideological discussions during these negotiations," said 
Marc Winer, 43, a native of Nashua, N.H., who is general director of the Moscow 
outlet. "The Soviets understood that the food was going to move very 
efficiently from the field to the mouth. That is more important to them right 
now than almost anything else."

BID TO CONTROL S.D. ATHEIST'S ESTATE FALTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's best-known atheist has a lost a key lawsuit in her fight for 
control of a fortune left by a religion-hating eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
The court defeat leaves the $14-million estate of the late, cranky James Hervey 
Johnson of San Diego -- as well as the oldest atheist publication in the 
country -- in the hands of a church-going Episcopalian and a Mormon, who say 
they intend to carry out Johnson's wishes of "(exposing) religion as against 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
Madalyn Murray O'Hair, atheism's most high-profile leader and self-described 
"most hated woman in America," says that the setback is only temporary and that 
she intends to keep fighting in the courts to keep "atheist money" away from 
those who believe in God. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be badgering them for the next 20 years," vowed the bombastic O'Hair, who 
played a role nearly 30 years ago in outlawing prayer in public schools and who 
also tried to prevent "In God We Trust" from being printed on American 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose even before Johnson, whose exaggerated holistic health ideas 
often compelled him to go long periods consuming nothing more than orange juice 
and condensed milk, died alone of a heart attack at age 87 in August, 1988, as 
he soaked his pain-riddled body in the bathtub inside his austere Hillcrest 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Johnson and O'Hair were rivals. While O'Hair was making headlines 
promoting atheist causes throughout the country, Johnson was quietly amassing a 
fortune by selling family property and using the money to invest in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Johnson assumed control of the Truth Seeker, which at 117 
years is the oldest atheist magazine in the nation, as well as two old atheist 
organizations -- the American Assn. for the Advancement of Atheism (AAAA) and 
the National League for the Separation of Church and State, also known as the 
National Liberal League. 
</P>
<P>
Through the Truth Seeker, Johnson launched racist and anti-Semitic attacks that 
drove many allies away and left him an outcast. But, among all the things he 
detested, one stood out: religion. 
</P>
<P>
And, in his will, filed a year before his death, Johnson demanded that his 
millions be placed in a trust and the income used "to publicize my views on 
religion and health." He selected Lawrence Y. True as the person to control it 
all. True, a bank trust officer, had known Johnson for 25 years but they 
weren't close, talking only a few times each year, and did little business 
together. 
</P>
<P>
True, now in his late 60s, has retired from his job to work full time on the 
estate, which has so far paid him a minimum of $217,000 for his services and is 
likely to pay him about $70,000 a year as caretaker of the trust. True is also 
an Episcopalian active in his Hillcrest congregation. 
</P>
<P>
That fact sent O'Hair into a frenzy. How, she asked, could a Christian and 
believer in religion and God have any idea about promoting atheism? She and 10 
other old-line atheists filed a lawsuit in San Diego federal court, claiming 
they were entitled to control the estate and take ownership of the Truth 
Seeker. The Austin, Tex.-based O'Hair even began printing a duplicate Truth 
Seeker. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson's death, O'Hair formally challenged the will in probate court. 
</P>
<P>
But, one after another, O'Hair's legal challenges have been rebuffed. First, a 
probate judge ruled against O'Hair's lawsuit, which has allowed True to begin 
spending money from the estate. O'Hair appealed and the matter is being 
considered by the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the federal court judge threw out a contention by O'Hair-led 
atheists that Johnson had amassed his fortune by mingling money from atheist 
organizations with his personal accounts. More important, the judge said O'Hair 
and several others could not be made party to the lawsuit. Then, three weeks 
ago, on Jan. 8, the judge dismissed the lawsuit entirely, in part because the 
last remaining plaintiff -- an ally of O'Hair's -- failed to prove he was a 
stockholder in the Truth Seeker. 
</P>
<P>
Still before the federal court, though, is a countersuit filed by Johnson's 
lawyers, accusing O'Hair of racketeering for allegedly conspiring to take over 
the Truth Seeker, AAAA and the National Liberal League, a charge she dismissed 
Wednesday as "a bunch of silliness." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Austin, O'Hair said she is confident that she and 
other atheists will end up victorious despite the recent court defeats. She 
said she plans to embark on a counter legal attack that includes appealing the 
federal court ruling, and, if that fails, she will file another lawsuit in the 
state courts in either California or New York, where the Truth Seeker was 
incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
The legal history of American atheism, she said, shows that the movement's 
defeats at the lower court level have often turned into victory at the 
appellate level. "The only hope we've ever had is at the appellate level," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the legal machinations, O'Hair has written critical letters to 
leaders of the Mormon Church and to the minister of True's church, chastising 
them for allowing members of their dominations to use atheist money. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Johnson's estate moves forward. Last year, it was worth $16.5 
million. Taxes took more than $1 million and fees to attorneys and True have 
consumed at least $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
A probate judge has allowed the remaining $14-million estate to be split into 
two parts; one fourth, or about $3.5 million, will be used to support the Truth 
Seeker, a publication that bears little resemblance to the magazine Johnson 
published, and which, to its critics, has nothing at all to do with promoting 
atheism but is instead a mishmash of New Age philosophy headed by Bonnie Lange, 
a Mormon and Johnson's former friend and housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the estate, about $10.5 million, has been placed in a 
charitable educational trust. Roy R. Withers, Johnson's attorney, said he is in 
the midst of registering the charitable trust with the state attorney general's 
office and applying for tax-exempt status from the IRS. Under the law, annual 
income from the trust, estimated to be about $1 million this year, must be 
disbursed by the end of the calendar year to organizations that promote 
Johnson's views on religion and health. 
</P>
<P>
That will make it one of San Diego's largest charitable trusts, and already, 
said Withers, groups and individuals from throughout the country have contacted 
him about obtaining grants. Withers and True are preparing a brochure on 
guidelines for applicants, who must have IRS tax-exempt status to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting calls from groups in L.A. and Wisconsin. . . . Some are against 
religion and others are into health science," Withers said. "When people know 
you have money to give, you don't have to advertise."

GORBACHEV DENIES HE'LL QUIT AS LEADER OF PARTY

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that he does not intend to 
resign as Communist Party chief, but the nation's media reflected a spirited 
debate over the future Soviet power structure before an important meeting of 
the party leadership early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about a resignation rumor that sent tremors through 
world capitals Tuesday, Gorbachev declared: "I have no intention of doing so 
(resigning his party post). No one has said this, and I certainly didn't make 
any such statement. Any such suggestions are groundless." 
</P>
<P>
Cable News Network reported Tuesday that Gorbachev was considering giving up 
his party post while trying to retain political control through his second 
office as president and head of the nation's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Buttressing Gorbachev's denial, which was made at a photo session with 
Brazilian President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a subsequent news conference: "It's better for 
perestroika when Gorbachev combines these two posts, because as President he 
can influence the party, and as a party member he can influence the 
Parliament." Perestroika is the term used to identify Gorbachev's program of 
political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also denied that a recent flurry of Western speculation about 
Gorbachev's political prospects had weakened the Soviet leader. However, the 
spokesman added, "Maybe (Gorbachev) is a little bit annoyed" by the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's denials, Western diplomats here speculated that the 
resignation rumors may have grown out of a genuine discussion under way in 
senior political circles about possible changes in the balance of power between 
the Communist Party apparatus and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Soviet leaders have reigned primarily through their leadership 
of the Communist Party, which still claims the "leading role" in society. But 
elsewhere in what used to be the Soviet Bloc, the old system has already given 
way. In Poland, for example, Wojciech Jaruzelski gave up his post as party 
leader last year and now exercises his power through an enhanced presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the possibility of a similar change here is occurring at a time 
when Gorbachev's program is under mounting threat from a stagnant economy and 
separatist threats from rebellious republics in the far-flung Soviet empire. 
Those threats, as well as discussion of the future role and structure of the 
party, are on the agenda of next week's plenary meeting of the 250-member 
Communist Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The plenum, which sets policy between full-blown party congresses, has the 
power to install or remove members of the ruling Politburo, which Gorbachev 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The lead-up to such a crucial meeting is typically filled with speculation 
about leadership changes. Combined with the genuine debate about redefining the 
party's role, it provides a natural breeding ground for the Gorbachev 
resignation rumors, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"I find a theoretical discussion completely plausible," one diplomat said 
Wednesday, adding: "I just don't see anything happening by the plenum. But I 
could imagine it by the end of the year," after other changes that would ensure 
no one else could use the party leadership to usurp Gorbachev's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov stressed Wednesday that the question of separating the powers and 
posts of Communist Party chief and president "was discussed very thoroughly" 
nearly a year ago, at the first session of the country's revitalized 
Parliament. A majority of deputies decided they wanted Gorbachev to hold both 
jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the main question raised by a "debate in print" published Wednesday by 
the Communist Party newspaper, Pravda, was whether Gorbachev needs more power, 
not less. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper keyed the debate on its front page with an excerpt from an 
unidentified reader's letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratization often turns into anarchy," it read. "The country and its 
economy are rocking under strikes and unprecedented disruptions in 
transportation and consumer supplies. Innocent blood is being spilled in some 
parts of the country. Did people hope for this when perestroika started? 
</P>
<P>
"But the most discouraging aspect of all is the sight of the central organs of 
power displaying disheartening irresolution under crisis circumstances. Perhaps 
the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Gorbachev) does not have 
enough powers? Then let's raise this issue . . . and resolve it at once. There 
is no time to waste. Perestroika is in danger!" 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Zots, a member of the Central Committee staff, argued for "a 
clearly defined" presidency, freed of subservience to the party. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, it is possible that a plenum of the Central Committee revokes 
his mandate as a (parliamentary) deputy on the party list, and we shall 
suddenly lose our head of state," Zots wrote. Currently, he warned, the Soviet 
president "has no legal protection whatsoever."

LEGISLATION: A LAWMAKER FORGED FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SIGNATURE ON CAMPAIGN

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan endorsed legislation introduced Wednesday aimed 
at closing a legal loophole that allegedly enabled an Orange County legislator 
to forge Reagan's signature on campaign materials without facing criminal 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was introduced in reaction to a recent court decision 
dismissing felony forgery charges against Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) 
for using the unauthorized Reagan signature on 480,000 campaign letters in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The 3rd District Court of Appeal held last week that Lewis' use of the phony 
Reagan signature did not defraud the voters of money or property -- ingredients 
needed to warrant a criminal charge. The court also noted that the state's 
election code held no criminal sanctions for the forged signature. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who helped draft the new bill, said Wednesday 
that he will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court decision stunned many legislators, who said they were afraid 
that it will encourage unscrupulous campaigners to forge signatures of 
well-known politicians and celebrities without fear of sanction. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) called a press conference to 
announce the introduction of a bill to make forging someone's name on campaign 
material a crime that could result in three years in prison and a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also allow the candidate who is victimized by falsified mailers, 
as well as the person whose unauthorized signature was used, to sue to recover 
actual and punitive damages in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said: "President Reagan supports 
Sen. Craven's bipartisan bill because it seeks to protect the good name, 
personal signature and political speech of every citizen. The right to publicly 
endorse or oppose candidates or initiatives is as precious as the right to vote 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
"This right must be safeguarded. President Reagan believes this measure will 
help restore much needed integrity and public confidence in California's 
political process," Weinberg added. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was directing campaign strategy for Assembly Republicans when he 
allegedly had Reagan's signature affixed to about 480,000 letters attacking 
Democrats in six Assembly districts during the waning days of the 1986 
legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis sent the letters after the White House had rejected the use of Reagan's 
name on the material, according to grand jury testimony. The ruse was 
discovered when a number of undeliverable letters began trickling back to the 
White House, which was listed as the return address on the campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
After district attorneys in Los Angeles and Sacramento counties declined to 
prosecute Lewis, Van de Kamp filed charges of felony forgery against the Orange 
County legislator. The appeals court rejected the charges. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lewis' Sacramento attorney accused Van de Kamp, a 1990 Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate, of political motivation in vowing to take the case to 
the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"An announcement on how to proceed in a legal case was made at a press 
conference by a candidate for political office," Dale Drozd said. "I think it's 
indicative that his (Van de Kamp's) decisions in this regard are being governed 
by political considerations, and not by legal analysis, and I think that's 
regrettable."

ABORTION FOES WIN LEGAL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
PROTESTS: A FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSES A SUIT OVER BLOCKADES AT FAMILY PLANNING 
CLINICS. HE ALSO VACATES AN INJUNCTION BARRING SUCH ACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge awarded a major victory to anti-abortion forces 
Wednesday in dismissing a lawsuit which asserted that Operation Rescue's 
blockades at family planning clinics violated the civil rights of women seeking 
to use the clinics' services. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima denied claims by the National Abortion 
Federation and other pro-choice groups that Operation Rescue's actions violated 
a woman's right to travel and her right to obtain an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima also vacated a preliminary injunction he issued March 15 barring 
blockades, thus freeing abortion opponents to reinstitute such actions without 
fear of legal consequences in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great result for us," Operation Rescue attorney Victor Smith said of 
the decision. He said that, while Tashima's decision "is not a world-changing 
decision, it will limit the tools of the opposition to interfere with the 
protests." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Finn, Operation Rescue's Southern California spokeswoman, said "we're 
encouraged that Judge Tashima feels that there are no grounds on a federal 
level to prevent Operation Rescue from saving babies and women from the 
destruction of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Finn said the organization's next major blockade is scheduled for Saturday, 
Feb. 17, but the location has not yet been made public. 
</P>
<P>
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel, the lead lawyer for the 
plaintiffs, said she will ask Tashima to stay his ruling today while she 
appeals it in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel denounced Tashima's ruling, saying it meant, in essence, that "women are 
forever prisoners of their biology." She stressed that Tashima's decision was 
in conflict with a ruling by a federal appeals court in New York last September 
and decisions by federal judges in Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ruling was not a surprise. In September, Tashima had ruled that 
"abortion seekers" are not a special class of people entitled to protection 
under the Ku Klux Klan Act, a 19th-Century civil rights law, which was the 
underpinning of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote: "Although women, under certain circumstances, still have a 
constitutional right to seek an abortion, the courts have never designated 
'abortion seekers' as a class requiring special protection. . . . The court 
holds that women seeking abortions is not a class intended to be protected by 
the Ku Klux Klan Act." 
</P>
<P>
Tashima told the plaintiffs that they could amend their complaint. But he 
expressed doubts about whether they could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorneys filed new papers in the case. But in his decision Wednesday, 
Tashima said they had not met their burden of showing that pregnant women were 
entitled to protection under the 19th-Century law. He said that the ACLU had 
failed to prove that Operation Rescue had animus against pregnant women in 
general, or women as a class. 
</P>
<P>
"Plaintiffs confuse effect with motive," Tashima wrote. "While the alleged 
blockade/rescue actions of defendants may have" the effect described in the 
lawsuit on pregnant women and women in general, in order to qualify for 
protection under the law the ACLU had to show that Operation Rescue was hostile 
toward those groups. 
</P>
<P>
The judge acknowledged that he had a difference of opinion with the New York 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima also said the ACLU complaint did not specify what federally protected 
right, privilege or immunity of the plaintiffs has been infringed by the 
defendants' conduct. He said the plaintiffs, to prevail, would have had to 
demonstrate that the government interfered with their legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also stated that health care clinics were not a protected class under 
the Ku Klux Klan Act. 
</P>
<P>
The statute was enacted during the Reconstruction Era and was designed to 
protect blacks from attacks by racists, but it has been applied to others since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, in criticizing Tashima's opinion, said it was nonsensical to say that 
Operation Rescue did not have animus against women seeking clinic services, 
including family planning counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that women and only women can get pregnant doesn't mean they're 
entitled less protection under the Constitution" than other groups covered by 
the law in question, Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said that if the ACLU's appeal is spurned, she will file a new suit in a 
state court seeking to enjoin Operation Rescue blockades. She said the basis 
would be the state Constitution's right to privacy and the Unruh Act, which 
prohibits anyone from using force or coercion to prohibit someone from 
exercising a lawful right. 
</P>
<P>
"We have constitutional and statutory rights that apply to women in California 
that are broader than federal rights," the lawyer said. "Our clients will not 
go unprotected." 
</P>
<P>
Tashima's decision Wednesday represented a marked shift from his earlier 
rulings in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In March, he issued an injunction against Operation Rescue prohibiting 
blockades. In August, he found Operation Rescue leaders in contempt for 
violating the injunction and ordered them to pay $110,000 in attorneys fees 
incurred in bringing the contempt action on behalf of pro-choice groups. The 
contempt order is not affected by Wednesday's decision.

TEST SPOTS 76% OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CARRIERS 
</P>

<P>
A new test can spot three-quarters of all adults who risk having children with 
cystic fibrosis, and more accurate versions should soon allow routine screening 
of everyone in the United States for this common genetic defect, researchers 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The screening can help parents avoid having children with cystic fibrosis. But 
experts say it also raises ethical and practical questions about who should get 
the test and what should be done with the information it provides. 
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease of young Americans. It 
occurs most often among whites, striking about one of every 2,500 white 
newborns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"People for years have realized that, if we had a good carrier test for cystic 
fibrosis, there would be the potential to test everyone before reproduction to 
see if they were a carrier or not," Dr. Arthur L. Beaudet said. "The evidence 
is at hand that such a carrier test will soon be available." 
</P>
<P>
One in every 25 white Americans carries one copy of the cystic fibrosis gene. 
They are healthy, but if they marry another carrier there is a 1-in-4 chance 
that their children will have cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
The disease causes a variety of symptoms, including abnormal mucous secretion 
that results in lung infections. Although doctors can ease many of the symptoms 
and extend lives, there is no treatment for the underlying disease. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, scientists pinpointed the precise genetic error or mutation 
responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis. The latest study found that 
checking people's genes for this defect can identify 76% of all carriers. 
</P>
<P>
That research, conducted by Beaudet and his colleagues at Baylor College of 
Medicine in Houston, was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
Drs. Lap-Chee Tsui of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Francis S. 
Collins of the University of Michigan, who discovered the cystic fibrosis gene, 
were co-authors of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lap-Chee and Collins pinpointed the mutated gene that accounts for 
about three-quarters of all cystic fibrosis cases, scientists at about 40 other 
laboratories are cooperating to track down the half-dozen or so other mutations 
that also can cause the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Collins predicted that these mutations will be identified within the next year. 
Then doctors should be able to offer screening tests that will identify 95% of 
all carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Experts hope that adults will use the test results for family planning. If 
couples learn that both are carriers, some might decide to adopt rather than 
run the risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. Others might opt to have 
artificial insemination with sperm from a donor who is not a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
If a couple chooses pregnancy, the test can be performed on the fetus, the 
researchers said. If the fetus turns out to have the disease, parents can then 
decide whether to have the baby or to get an abortion.

REFUGEES TRAPPED IN SUDANESE CITY BESIEGED BY REBELS

For a lucky few in the besieged, refugee-jammed Sudanese city of Juba, $350 can 
buy space on a packed cargo plane to Khartoum. For others, there is virtually 
no escape. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees said that the Sudanese army is preventing thousands of frightened 
civilians from fleeing to rebel-held territory outside the town to escape 
shellfire, food shortages and the threat of rebel attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which surrounds Juba, has urged civilians 
to leave before it launches a full-scale attack on the army garrison. 
</P>
<P>
The city holds 300,000 people, two-thirds of them refugees from other areas. 
Few can afford to leave through Juba airport, which is the only permitted 
outlet, according to civilians who have taken the 750-mile flight north to 
Khartoum. 
</P>
<P>
One who arrived Tuesday said he paid $355 to fly aboard a cargo plane packed 
with people, mainly women and children. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign relief officials said authorities in Juba are preventing civilians from 
leaving in the hope that their presence will deter the rebels from launching an 
all-out attack. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees reported short food supplies in the city. 
</P>
<P>
No overland convoys of relief food have reached the city since September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Relief flights of corn and beans from Uganda and Kenya were banned for three 
months until last Wednesday by the Khartoum government, a restriction that has 
allowed only limited supplies to be flown in from Khartoum. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1983 against what it sees 
as the domination of mainly Christian and animist southern Sudan by the 
staunchly Muslim and Arab north.

5 ALBANIANS DIE IN ETHNIC RIOTS IN YUGOSLAVIA

Five ethnic Albanians were reported killed in riots Wednesday in Kosovo 
province, while about 100,000 Slavs rallied at anti-Albanian protests 
throughout Yugoslavia, some firing guns in the air and demanding arms to fight 
in the province. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member collective state presidency, Yugoslavia's highest 
constitutional body, said the situation in the southern province is 
"deteriorating" after eight days of clashes between police and ethnic Albanians 
demanding political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidency has ordered that measures be taken to protect the peace and 
security of inhabitants of villages threatened by inter-ethnic confrontations," 
according to a statement carried by Tanjug news agency. No details of the 
measures were provided. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug, 15 people have been killed since the ethnic Albanians, who 
are the majority in Serbian-ruled Kosovo, took to the streets. Reporters in 
Kosovo say about 26 people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Among Kosovo's 1.9 million inhabitants, ethnic Albanians outnumber Slavs 9 to 
1. 
</P>
<P>
State-run TV described the situation as on "the verge of civil war." 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is an administrative part of Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia. 
Its ethnic Albanians want more autonomy, a stop to political trials, free 
elections, release of political prisoners and lifting of a year-old state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The state news agency Tanjug said at least three people were killed and five 
injured Wednesday in Glogovac, a village 12 miles south of Pristina, capital of 
Kosovo. It said police used a helicopter to disperse "several thousand 
aggressive" protesters there. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Yugoslav television said police shot and killed a man in the village 
of Stanovac. 
</P>
<P>
The television report also showed an anti-Albanian rally of about 100,000 Slavs 
in Titograd. Gunfire could be heard, and speakers implored demonstrators to 
stop firing handguns. Several rallies were also held in Belgrade, the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
At Ivangrad, another 10,000 people demonstrated against "Albanian separatists 
and Slovenian and Croatian leaders supporting them," the news agency Tanjug 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As violence spread through Kosovo on Wednesday, protesters called for military 
intervention to end "the Albanian uprising." 
</P>
<P>
At Vucitrn, 20 miles northwest of Pristina, five demonstrators were reported 
injured, apparently in clashes with police. 
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes were also reported in Lipljan, Titova Mitrovica, Klina, 
Prizren, Kosovska Kamenica and Gnjilane.

Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Church, was in 
serious condition Wednesday but improving after two emergency operations for 
bleeding in his digestive system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp, 61, first underwent surgery Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors discovered a massive hemorrhage in the alimentary canal, which 
comprises the esophagus, stomach and intestines, the state PAP news service 
said. He then underwent a second operation late Tuesday night and early 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"After the (second) operation, the condition of the patient underwent 
improvement. Nevertheless, it is still described as serious," according to a 
joint statement released by doctors and the church. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp is in the intensive care unit of a large public hospital in the Praga 
section of Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
A priest at the cardinal's residence, declining to give his name, said Glemp 
first was taken to the hospital when he felt faint Tuesday and requested to see 
a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
President Wojciech Jaruzelski visited Glemp in the hospital Tuesday night and 
"closely follows the course of Cardinal Glemp's treatment," PAP said. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp, primate since 1981 and a cardinal since 1983, is spiritual leader to the 
more than 90% of Poland's 38 million people who regard themselves as Roman 
Catholics.

HELD FOR 2 YEARS, ITALIAN KIDNAP VICTIM ESCAPES

<P>
A 20-year-old man who spent two years in the hands of kidnapers returned home 
Wednesday to a grateful mother and a cheering crowd of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of honking cars jammed the streets of Pavia, 20 miles south of Milan, 
where Ceasare Casella was reunited with his parents, ending one of Italy's 
longest and most dramatic kidnapings for ransom. 
</P>
<P>
Casella escaped Tuesday when his kidnapers, apparently panicked when they 
learned that police patrols were nearby, left him chained to a pole at a 
mountain stream near a southern village. 
</P>
<P>
National police and paratroopers found Casella around 10 p.m. Tuesday after he 
knocked on the door of a cottage outside the Aspromonte village of Careri to 
seek help. 
</P>
<P>
Casella told police he managed to uproot the pole he had been chained to and 
escape with the chains still around his neck and wrists. 
</P>
<P>
Police brought Casella to Pavia early Wednesday morning in a motorcade after he 
was flown from southern Italy to Milan aboard an air force DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
He was hugged and kissed by his mother, Angela, who last June provoked a 
national outcry when she spent 10 days touring the villages of the 
bandit-ridden Aspromonte region, on the toe of Italy, demanding the release of 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits seized Casella outside his home in Pavia on Jan. 18, 1988, and took 
him to a hide-out in the Aspromonte area. His father, auto salesman Luigi 
Casella, had paid $800,000 to the bandits on Aug. 15, 1988. But the kidnapers 
then demanded $4 million more.

<P>
The pattern, by now, is familiar. Taking advantage of events tumbling his way, 
George Bush has put together a striking proposal that is the foreign policy 
equivalent of motherhood and apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, as he surveyed the political scene, he found on this side of the 
Atlantic a Congress growing increasingly reluctant to foot the bill for 305,000 
U.S. troops stationed in a post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, he found an Eastern Europe throwing off the communist yoke 
and pressuring the Kremlin to pull its troops back to behind Soviet borders. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? Seize the moment. 
</P>
<P>
And so he did. Wednesday night, the President whose foreign policy watchword 
has been prudence, suddenly called on the Soviet Union to join him in agreeing 
to make further massive cuts in the forces arrayed along the thoroughly frayed 
East-West divide -- forces which appear each day less likely to be called to 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush managed to accomplish the announcement in what has become true Bush 
fashion: when it was least expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of the timing of the speech and the circumstances allowing 
us to do this. It was a coincidence of situations," a senior White House 
official said, marveling quietly at both the surprise with which the 
President's plan was greeted, and the fortuitous timing that allowed Bush to 
turn to his advantage events beyond his control in Europe and unrelenting 
pressures at home. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal is "an attempt to catch up with events that are moving very 
fast," a senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's troop cut plan, political analyst William Schneider said, "accepted the 
inevitable" -- that the massive changes in Eastern Europe coupled with U.S. 
budget pressure meant troop levels had to come down. But he did it with a 
"dramatic gesture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Time Is Right' 
</P>
<P>
The twin tracks came together when Bush, in the historic, majestic setting of 
the House of Representatives, declared in his first State of the Union address: 
"The time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to 
move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe -- a coherent 
defense program that ensures that the United States will continue to be a 
catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe 
is essential -- and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military 
presence in Eastern Europe," the President said. "But our troop levels can 
still be lower. So tonight, I am announcing a major new step for further 
reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 
on each side." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union now has approximately 565,000 troops deployed beyond its 
borders in Eastern and Central Europe. The United States has 255,000 troops 
stationed in Central Europe, and a total of 305,000 throughout the continent. 
</P>
<P>
But in the weeks and months leading up to the speech, the Warsaw Pact nations 
have been rocked by the turmoil of popular revolutions. In May, when Bush 
offered a plan to cut U.S. and Soviet troop levels in Europe down to 275,000 on 
each side, Communist governments still tightly tied to the Soviets controlled 
almost all of Eastern Europe. But since then, Communist Party power has been 
diluted, and in some cases ended, in one Eastern European country after 
another, undercutting the welcome given to the Soviet troops that have been 
deployed throughout the region since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, senior members of Congress have begun insisting that the 
President take advantage of these stunning developments to begin withdrawing 
U.S. troops from Europe. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee who for more than a decade has tried to pressure 
succeeding administrations to trim the European force, has argued that the U.S. 
troop strength could be reduced to between 200,000 and 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bettered Critics 
</P>
<P>
All the while, critics objected that the Administration was offering nothing to 
respond to those events. As recently as eight weeks ago, Bush, speaking to 
reporters after his summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
fended off that criticism, saying he wanted to get his May proposal "locked in" 
before he proposed any new troop cut proposal. Now, Bush, in effect, has seen 
the critics' proposed cuts and has gone 5,000 further. 
</P>
<P>
The President's proposal "became a real option a couple of weeks ago," said a 
senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, although 
he insisted the timing "was not something that was rushed by the speech. The 
circumstances allowed us to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The move, Schneider noted, followed what's become the "typical rhythm of the 
Bush presidency." 
</P>
<P>
"A crisis emerges and dominates the agenda, the Administration seems not to 
have a response and they are called timid. Then, all of a sudden, Bush comes up 
with a dramatic proposal." The political impact of the proposal is heightened 
precisely because it comes after the public repeatedly has heard that the 
Administration is not acting. 
</P>
<P>
As much as Bush has told interviewers and others that he disdains managing 
events for dramatic appeal, he appreciates -- indeed seems to thrive on -- the 
inherent ability of a carefully managed presidency to spring surprises on an 
unsuspecting audience, and to take advantage of those surprises. 
</P>
<P>
As he posed for photographers at the start of a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Bush 
was asked whether such a troop cut proposal was in the offing. "The speech 
comes on at 9 tonight and there's going to be a lot of surprises there -- 
maybe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President made the troop cut proposal -- which he discussed earlier in the 
day on the telephone with Gorbachev -- only after his most senior aides 
carefully let out the word that the State of the Union speech would be one 
addressing broad themes of the Bush presidency, rather than providing "a 
laundry list" of specific programs the President wants enacted in the new year 
or startling initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, over a period of about two weeks, they leaked to reporters details of 
each of the domestic programs.

Here is the prepared text of President Bush's State of the Union address 
Wednesday night: 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress: I return as 
a former President of the Senate, and former member of this great House. Now, 
as President, it is my privilege to report to you on the State of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, I come not to speak about the "state of the government" -- not to 
detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor to describe every 
line item in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people 
about the State of the Union -- about our world -- the changes we've seen, the 
challenges we face. And what that means for America. 
</P>
<P>
There are singular moments in history: dates that divide all that goes before 
from all that comes after. Many of us in this chamber have lived much of our 
lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945. The events of 
that year decreed the shape of nations. The pace of progress. Freedom or 
oppression for millions of people around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen forty-five provided the common frame of reference -- the compass 
points of the post-war era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. That was 
our world. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the year just ended -- the revolution of '89 -- have been a chain 
reaction -- change so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the 
world's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Think back -- just 12 short months ago -- to the world we knew -- as 1989 
began. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear, under the thumb of a 
dictator. Today, democracy is restored -- Panama is free. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Just Cause has achieved its objective. The number of military 
personnel in Panama is now close to what it was before the operation began. And 
tonight, I am announcing that -- well before the end of February -- the 
additional numbers of American troops -- the brave men and women of our armed 
forces who made this mission a success -- will be back home. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to open a dialogue 
with the communist rulers of that country. Today, with the future of a free 
Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish government. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner in 
Prague. Today, it's Vaclav Havel -- president of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
And one year ago, Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide. 
He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. Today -- less 
than one year later -- it's the wall that's history. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable events -- events that fulfill the long-held hopes of the American 
people. Events that validate the long-standing goals of American policy -- a 
policy based on a single, shining principle: the cause of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
America -- not just the nation -- but an idea, alive in the minds of people 
everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of a 
widening circle of freedom -- today, tomorrow and into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these 
shores -- and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation -- this 
idea called America -- was and always will be -- a new world. Our new world. 
</P>
<P>
At a workers' rally -- in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague -- 
the idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to 
speak at the factory gates. He begins his speech to his fellow citizens with 
these words -- words of a distant revolution: 
</P>
<P>
"We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among 
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that, here at home, freedom's door opened long ago. The 
cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: Democracy. 
Competition. Opportunity. Private investment. Stewardship. And of course, 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours -- a system 
second to none -- and make it better. 
</P>
<P>
A better America, where there's a job for everyone who wants one. 
</P>
<P>
Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in 
safe and loving care -- and where government works to expand child care 
alternatives for parents. 
</P>
<P>
Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
Where "Made in the U.S.A." is recognized around the world as the symbol of 
quality and progress. 
</P>
<P>
Where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work, and to 
contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American mainstream 
includes all of our disabled citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Where everyone has a roof over his head -- and where the homeless get the help 
they need to live in dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers -- and where 
all of them make the grade. 
</P>
<P>
Where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out to our hostages 
-- our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
That's part of the future we want to see -- the future we can make for 
ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our horizon 
-- commit to the long-view. Our plans for the future start today. 
</P>
<P>
In the tough competitive markets around, America faces great challenges and 
great opportunities. We know that we can succeed in the global economic arena 
of the '90s, but to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes 
-- some crucial investments in ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Yes -- we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined to 
encourage the creation of capital -- capital of all kinds. Physical capital: 
Everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, 
all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services. 
Intellectual capital: The source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And 
of course, our human capital: The talented work force we'll need to compete in 
the global market. 
</P>
<P>
And let me tell you: If we ignore human capital -- we lose the spirit of 
American ingenuity -- the spirit that is the hallmark of the American worker. 
And the American worker is the most productive worker in the world. 
</P>
<P>
We need to save more -- expand the pool of capital for the new investments that 
mean more jobs, more growth. That's the idea behind a new initiative I call the 
Family Savings Plan, which I will send to the Congress tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
We need to cut the tax on capital gains -- encourage risk-takers -- especially 
those in our small businesses -- to take those steps that translate into 
economic reward, jobs and a better life for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment is 
there. The money is there. It's there for Research and Development, R&amp;D -- 
a record high. It's there for our housing initiative -- HOPE, to help everyone 
from first-time home buyers to the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids 
drug-free: 70% more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space 
exploration -- and it's there for education: another record high. 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing: Last fall at the education summit, the governors and I 
agreed to look for ways to help make sure kids are ready to learn -- the very 
first day they walk into that classroom. I've made good on that commitment -- 
by proposing a record increase in funds -- an extra half a billion dollars -- 
for something near and dear to all of us: Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
Education is the one investment that means more for our future because it means 
the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not simply a 
matter of spending more. It is a matter of asking more -- expecting more -- of 
our schools, our teachers, of our kids, and our parents and ourselves. That's 
why tonight I am announcing America's education goals -- goals developed with 
the nation's governors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less 
than 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And we're going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something: In 
critical subjects -- at the 4th, 8th and 12th grades -- we must assess our 
students' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world in math and 
science achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every American adult must be a literate worker and citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it 
possible for our kids to learn -- every school in America must be drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at stake. 
This nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education. 
</P>
<P>
These investments will keep America competitive. And I know this about the 
American people: We welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity and energy 
-- our experience and technology -- our spirit and enterprise -- against 
anyone. Let the competition be free -- but let it be fair. America is ready. 
</P>
<P>
Since we really mean it -- and since we are serious about being ready to meet 
that challenge -- we're getting our own house in order. We've made real 
progress. Seven years ago, the federal deficit was 6% of our gross national 
product. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1% of 
the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
That budget brings federal spending under control. It meets the Gramm-Rudman 
target, brings that deficit down further, and balances the budget by 1993 -- 
with no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And let me tell you, there's still more than enough federal spending. For most 
of us, $1.2 trillion is a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must when 
it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and grandchildren. We 
will start paying off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
And there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship -- 
the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental 
Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not more bureaucracy, not more red tape -- 
but the certainty that here at home, and in our dealings with other nations, 
environmental issues have the status they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our 
environment, with over $1 billion for global change research. And a new 
initiative I will call "America the Beautiful" -- to expand our national parks 
and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
And something else: something that will help keep this country clean, from our 
forest land to our inner cities, and keep America beautiful for generations to 
come -- the money to plant a billion trees a year. 
</P>
<P>
And tonight, let me say again to all the members of Congress: The American 
people did not send us here to bicker. There's work to do -- and they sent us 
here to get it done. And once again, I offer my hand to all of you. Let's work 
together to do the will of the people. Clean air. Child care. The Educational 
Excellence Act. Crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill. 
Transportation policy. Product liability reform. Enterprise zones. It's time to 
act together. 
</P>
<P>
And there's one thing I hope we'll all be able to agree on. It's about our 
commitments. I'm talking about Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
To every American out there on Social Security, to every American supporting 
that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they retire: We made a 
promise to you -- and we are going to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
We rescued the system in 1983 -- and it's sound again. Our budget fully funds 
today's benefits -- and it assures that future benefits will be funded as well. 
The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
There's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful consideration 
to the recommendations of the health care studies now underway. That's why 
tonight, I am instructing Dr. Louis Sullivan -- secretary of health and human 
services -- to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the 
quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system. I am 
committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control. 
</P>
<P>
The "state of the government" does indeed depend on many of us in this very 
chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must maintain 
the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals. I 
have been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country. Every one 
of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not 
next week, not tomorrow, but right now. 
</P>
<P>
The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor -- claim the 
problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when there's 
trouble -- lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need. 
We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, 
help them with their homework, and pass along the values we learned as 
children. That's how we sustain the State of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
Every effort is important. It all adds up -- it's doing the things that give 
democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are -- and who we will be. 
</P>
<P>
And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea -- so long as we 
live up to the American ideal -- the State of the Union will remain sound and 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
And to those who worry we have lost our way -- well, I want you to listen to 
parts of a letter written by James Markwell -- Pfc. James Markwell, a 
20-year-old Army medic of the 1st Battalion, 75th Rangers. It's dated Dec. 18 
-- the night before our armed forces went into action in Panama. It's a letter 
servicemen write -- and hope will never be sent. Sadly, Private Markwell's 
mother did receive this letter. And she passed it on to me. 
</P>
<P>
Here is some of what he wrote: "I have never been afraid of death, but now he 
is waiting at the corner. . . . I have been trained to kill and to save, so has 
everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, yet. . . . Do not 
mourn for me, revel in the life that I have died to give you. . . . But most of 
all, don't forget that the Army was my choice. Something that I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and ensure that you are free to 
do what you want and live your lives freely." 
</P>
<P>
Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama, and one of the 
first to fall. 
</P>
<P>
He knew what he believed in. He carried the idea we call America in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There is 
a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a need for 
leadership that only America can provide. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry 
Truman predicted such a time would come. He said: "As our world grows stronger, 
more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the iron curtain, then 
inevitably there will come a time of change within the communist world." 
</P>
<P>
Today, that change is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years, America and its allies held communism in check, and 
ensured that democracy would continue to exist. Today, with communism 
crumbling, our aim must be to ensure democracy's advance. To take the lead in 
forging peace and freedom's best hope -- a great and growing commonwealth of 
free nations. 
</P>
<P>
To the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new 
consensus at home and abroad -- a common vision of the peaceful world we want 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
Here in our own hemisphere, it's time for all the people of the Americas -- 
North and South -- to live in freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In the Far East and Africa, it is time for the full flowering of free 
governments and free markets that have served as the engine of progress. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. So 
that continent -- for too long a continent divided -- can see a future whole 
and free. 
</P>
<P>
And it's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union -- to 
endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy 
and economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
We are in a period of great transition, great hope, yet great uncertainty. We 
recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see 
little change in Soviet strategic modernization. Therefore, we must sustain our 
own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement 
to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe -- a 
coherent defense program that ensures the U.S. will continue to be a catalyst 
for peaceful change in Europe. I've consulted with leaders of NATO -- and in 
fact, I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev, just today. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe 
is essential -- and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military 
presence in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But troop levels can still be lower. So tonight, I am announcing a major new 
step -- for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and 
Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side. 
</P>
<P>
This number reflects the advice of our senior military advisers. It is designed 
to protect American and European interests -- and sustain NATO's defense 
strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms-control talks -- conventional, 
chemical and strategic -- must now be our goal. That time has come. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: In many regions of the world 
tonight, the reality is conflict -- not peace. Enduring animosities and 
opposing interests remain. Thus the cause of peace must be served by an America 
strong enough -- and sure enough -- to defend our interests and ideals. It's 
this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire the Revolution 
of '89. 
</P>
<P>
Here at home -- and in the world -- there is history in the making -- and 
history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at 
the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen 
workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall crosses 
rise up from the stones. Atop each cross, an anchor -- an ancient symbol of 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of change 
-- a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart of the 
idea that is America. 
</P>
<P>
Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchor has always been 
faith and family. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few days of this past momentous year, our family was blessed once 
more -- celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th 
grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at home and abroad 
seemed manageable -- in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know what you're thinking: That's a grandfather talking. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year -- 
across this country, and everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe. All 
kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding young environmentalists I 
met this month, who joined me exploring the Florida Everglades. The Little 
Leaguers I played catch with in Poland -- ready to go from Warsaw to the World 
Series. Even the kids who are ill or alone -- God bless those boarder babies, 
born addicted to drugs -- coping with problems no child should have to face. 
</P>
<P>
But, you know, when it comes to hope and the future: Every kid is the same. 
Full of dreams. Ready to take on the world. All special because they are the 
very future of freedom. To them belongs this new world I've been speaking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
So tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Let me start with my 
generation -- the grandparents out there. You are our living link to the past. 
Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged, at home and abroad. Of 
sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well 
-- because every American has a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Parents: Your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell them of 
faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them that of all 
the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious legacy. And of 
all the gifts then can give, the greatest is helping others. 
</P>
<P>
And to the children and young people out there tonight: With you rests our hope 
-- all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your vision 
on a new century -- your century. On dreams we cannot see. On the destiny that 
is yours -- and yours alone. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, let all Americans -- all of us together here in this chamber, the 
symbolic center of democracy -- affirm our allegiance to this idea we call 
America. And let us all remember that the State of the Union depends on each 
and every one of us.

GOALS PROVING ELUSIVE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: THE MANY CONFLICTING IDEAS ON HOW TO REVAMP THE SYSTEM ARE ONLY ADDING 
TO THE GROWING CRISIS.

<P>
In setting ambitious achievement goals for science education, President Bush in 
his State of the Union address Wednesday night spotlighted one of the nation's 
most thoroughly documented problems. The abysmal state of science education has 
been chronicled by more than 300 studies in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the hard part: There are as many conflicting ideas on how to revamp 
the system as there are reports. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what the goals are. But we still don't know how to achieve them," said 
James Rutherford, a leading science educator. "One reason we can't make any 
headway is we haven't had a clear national strategy on how to get from where we 
are to where we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there is disagreement on virtually every issue, such as whether to 
encourage or ban the use of calculators and computers, whether to concentrate 
on basic science literacy for all or for only the best and brightest, whether 
to delay math training until students master reading and writing and whether to 
focus resources on mentoring and other support systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement on Need 
</P>
<P>
The only consensus is on the critical need for more federal leadership and 
funding. But while the new Bush budget proposals represent a start in that 
direction, there is a long way to go, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week the private Economic Policy Institute here, in an analysis of 
education spending from kindergarten through grade 12, put the United States in 
14th place among 16 industrialized nations in such spending as a percentage of 
national income, ahead of only Ireland and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning crisis in science education is unprecedented since the Russians 
launched Sputnik in 1957 and triggered a new emphasis on science education. 
</P>
<P>
The concern comes amid foreboding forecasts that the overwhelming majority of 
new workers entering the work force by the year 2000 will be female, black and 
Latino -- groups that have fared the worst in science education. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is reason for hope, judging from the few nascent attempts to 
restructure science education around the country, including some in California. 
</P>
<P>
Sets Goal to Be Best 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the President simply declared, without getting into specifics: 
"By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world in math and science 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also mentioned several other "education goals" to be achieved by that 
year, including a high school graduation rate of "no less than 90%." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of details, educators were pleased by Bush's mention of 
education, in general, and the goal he set for science and math, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a refreshing breeze," said Bill G. Aldridge, executive director of the 
National Science Teachers Assn. "We certainly don't need any more studies." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what some of those studies show: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 29% of all high schools have no physics teacher, 17% no chemistry teacher 
and 8% no biology teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The typical high school biology textbook introduces more new words than the 
first two years of a foreign language class. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Student disenchantment with science appears to take hold about the 8th 
grade. While 5th graders rank 8th among industrialized nations in science, by 
the time they reach 9th grade, they have dropped to 15th, according to National 
Science Foundation data. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of high school students who enter college intent on pursuing a science 
career, 40% drop out after the first course and 60% by graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- College enrollment in science courses is at an all-time low and industry 
already is feeling the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerospace Industries Assn. said that 67% of its members -- including most 
of the top Pentagon and NASA contractors -- are suffering from a shortage of 
scientists and engineers. And 55% report a shortage of skilled production 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the NSF predicts a shortfall of 560,000 scientists and engineers by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
To meet such a demand if the graduation rate for white males in those areas 
remained steady, U.S. colleges and universities would have to graduate twice as 
many women, five times as many blacks and seven times as many Latinos -- 
beginning this year, says the congressionally chartered Task Force on Women, 
Minorities and the Handicapped in Science and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
In the Administration's new budget, the NSF would get a 14% increase, to $2.38 
billion, including $251 million for science education. Moreover, according to 
White House Science Adviser D. Allan Bromley, the Administration intends to 
double the foundation budget by 1993, from the base year of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In overall federal funding for science education, the President is proposing a 
26% increase, from $841 million to $1.06 billion, spread among numerous 
agencies, such as the NSF, the Department of Education, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy and the National 
Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project 2061 Launched 
</P>
<P>
Among the new attempts to reform science education is Project 2061, launched by 
the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. It is named for the year 
that Halley's Comet will next pass Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The project's current three-year phase enables teams of 25 teachers in six 
school districts, including the cities of San Diego and San Francisco, to work 
four days a month -- and daily each summer -- to design experimental K to 12 
curricula, according to Rutherford, AAAS's chief education officer. 
</P>
<P>
A shorter-term, federally funded project, launched by the National Science 
Teachers Assn., is designed to come up with new science core programs for 7th 
through 12th graders that abandon the century-old "layer cake" approach, which 
requires 10th graders to take biology, 11th graders chemistry and 12th graders 
physics, Aldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, he said, is to expose more students -- especially women and 
minorities -- to a broad spectrum of science topics earlier but less intensely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CHANGING WORK FORCE 
</P>
<P>
The nation's pool of talent for new scientists and engineers by the end of the 
century will be predominantly female, minority or disabled -- the very segments 
of our population we have not attracted to science and engineering careers in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 42.8 million persons will enter the overall labor force between 
1988 and the year 2000. The breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
White Women: 35.2% 
</P>
<P>
White Men: 31.6%

BUSH PUTS BIG BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA, LAWMAKERS CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: NINE OF THE STATE'S DEMOCRATS SAY THE PRESIDENT IS USING BASE CLOSINGS 
AS A PARTISAN WEAPON AND IS IGNORING DOMESTIC NEEDS.

<P>
California Democrats charged Wednesday that President Bush's proposed 1991 
budget places an especially heavy burden on California taxpayers, uses military 
base closings as a partisan political weapon and ignores domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining their assessment of the budget's impact at a joint news conference, 
nine members of the California Democratic congressional delegation said they 
will fight for more money for domestic programs such as Medicare and AIDS 
research and less for strategic weapons projects such as "Star Wars" and the 
Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they would seek, in the words of Rep. Vic Fazio of West 
Sacramento, to "take the politics out of the process" by which the 
Administration has targeted 55 military bases and other facilities -- 10 of 
them in California -- for possible closure next year. 
</P>
<P>
Serving notice that he will lead the delegation's budget battle from his 
pivotal position as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Leon E. 
Panetta of Carmel Valley said the President's proposed budget cuts would have a 
"tremendous" negative impact in areas important to California such as 
transportation, where Amtrak would be eliminated, and Medicare, where $5.5 
billion in budget cuts are being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"With regard to savings, the weight of the budget cuts is on domestic programs, 
particularly in the entitlement area. . . . Many of those reductions impact on 
areas very important to California," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta offered no specific figures, saying the delegation's assessment of the 
budget's impact on California was still being developed. 
</P>
<P>
But citing just one example, Rep. Howard Berman of Panorama City warned that 
the state would be saddled with a more than $500-million federal tab as a 
result of proposed cuts in a grant program set up in 1986 to assist newly 
legalized immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae and Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco both 
criticized what they said was the budget's insufficient funding for AIDS 
research, while Rep. Esteban E. Torres of La Puente said he was angered by the 
budget's failure to reverse the decline in funds for housing assistance begun 
under the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Although housing prices have stabilized recently, fewer than 20% of our 
state's population could afford the median $194,000 price of a home in 
California in 1990," Torres said. Yet it is clear, Torres said, "President Bush 
intends to follow in his predecessor's footsteps . . . reducing the federal 
government's commitment to low-income housing assistance." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, who also included Reps. Don Edwards of San Jose, Glenn M. 
Anderson of San Pedro and Norman Y. Mineta of San Jose, took sharp issue with 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's "hit list" of military bases that could be 
closed next year, calling it a politically motivated ploy to put Democats on 
the budget defensive and preempt their calls for steep defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously feel defense cuts have to play an important role in budget 
savings this year, but these savings must be real," said Panetta. He said past 
experience shows that the short-term cost of closing military bases often 
outweighs the immediate savings. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that most of the bases slated for closure and nearly all the resulting 
job losses were in Democratic districts, Fazio charged that Cheney's list was 
drafted with partisan politics, not defense considerations, in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cheney) wanted to portray Congress, i.e. the Democrats, as pork barreling, 
parochial representatives. He wanted to put us all in some sort of political 
disarray, hoping that he could slow down the movement towards reduced defense 
spending," Fazio charged. 
</P>
<P>
Likening Cheney's base list to a "hand grenade thrown into the process," Boxer 
joined Fazio and other California members on the budget committee in supporting 
a proposal by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to 
resurrect a bipartisan selection committee that would be empowered to decide 
which bases, if any, should be closed. 
</P>
<P>
More generally but no less angrily, the Democrats also contended that Bush's 
budget failed to reflect either the needs of the nation or the momentous 
changes that have taken place in the world, especially in East Europe, over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is wearing blinders when it comes to the real needs of this 
nation," Pelosi said. "We live in a changed world (where) the Soviet threat can 
no longer be used to justify ignoring the needs of the American people for 
education, health care and economic opportunity."

NEW THEORY MAY BURST SOME COSMIC BUBBLES; 
</P>
<P>
ASTRONOMY: PRINCETON SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOLVED THE BAFFLING MYSTERY 
OF SOME GIANT STRUCTURES IN THE UNIVERSE. IT'S A MATTER OF SIMPLE GRAVITY, THEY 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, scientists have been baffled by the discovery of huge bubbles 
in the universe that seem to be devoid of matter and by giant walls of galaxies 
that stretch on for hundreds of millions of light-years. No one could determine 
what mysterious forces would have created such giant structures. 
</P>
<P>
Some theorists have suggested that massive explosions might have swept some 
areas clean, creating the bubbles and pushing matter together to form great 
walls of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists at Princeton University believe they now have the answer. Aided 
by a powerful computer, they have concluded that nothing more than gravity was 
needed to form the great structures that astronomers are now finding throughout 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no violent pumping of energy into the early universe" to create the 
features, astrophysicist J. Richard Gott said in a telephone interview. He said 
research he has conducted with his graduate student, Changbom Park, shows that 
gravity, acting on very slight fluctuations in the distribution of matter a 
fraction of a second after the Big Bang, would account for the great structures 
now seen in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"Gravity works very quietly," Gott said. "It just takes time." 
</P>
<P>
The finding could prove anticlimactic for scientists who have searched for an 
exotic explanation for the huge voids, which have tantalized the world of 
astronomy ever since they were discovered four years ago. The discovery of the 
bubbles was hailed literally around the world by the popular press as well as 
scientific journals because it suggested that something terribly mysterious had 
happened in the earliest universe, creating giant structures that staggered the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Princeton team is correct, it was nothing more than the normal 
functioning of one of the four fundamental forces of nature. 
</P>
<P>
During the lifetime of the universe, simple gravity would have caused small 
pockets of matter to accumulate other particles, growing into stars and 
clusters of stars and even great walls of galaxies such as one discovered last 
year that is more than half a billion light-years long. 
</P>
<P>
By simulating the accretion of matter over the lifetime of the universe, Gott 
and Park have created computer images that are remarkably similar to 
observational data from astronomers in the field. Their work is being published 
today in the British scientific journal of the Royal Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the credibility of the basic cosmological models that theorists 
have used for years to comprehend the universe. Gott's findings fit nicely with 
current theories. If he is wrong, theorists will have to come up with a new 
explanation for why a universe that began as a tightly compacted -- and 
presumably homogeneous -- primordial soup would have led to the development of 
such irregular structures as scientists are now finding. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists who are using computers to try to simulate the evolution of 
the universe tend to grant the Princeton research considerable credibility, but 
not everyone is convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"I retain some healthy skepticism," said astrophysicist Margaret Geller, who 
along with John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 
Cambridge discovered the "bubbles" several years ago and the "Great Wall" of 
galaxies announced last November. Geller said in a telephone interview that she 
had seen some of Gott's earlier work and she does not think the images emerging 
from his computer match the observational data. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Bertschinger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has 
carried out research similar to Gott's but on a smaller scale, also remains a 
little skeptical but believes the great mystery may well be much closer to 
being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Princeton work) should be treated as preliminary because nobody else 
has done a simulation this large," Bertschinger said. "But it's interesting 
work and it suggests that gravity is capable of making more complicated 
structures than we had thought." 
</P>
<P>
Gott insisted that his findings also fit nicely with the first results from the 
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), a spacecraft launched in November to study 
the background radiation left over from the Big Bang. One of the things COBE is 
looking for is evidence of cataclysmic events like energy-releasing explosions 
that could have swept particles from the Big Bang into tighter formations, 
leading eventually to the formation of such things as galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
The first results from COBE, released in mid-January, showed no trace of such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
And that has puzzled scientists who had expected COBE to find some evidence of 
extraordinary events in the background radiation left over from the Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely mystified (by) how the present-day structure has come to exist 
without having left some trace," John C. Mather of NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center said in announcing the first results during the winter meeting of the 
American Astronomical Society in Arlington, Va. "There should have been some 
kind of energy release (after the Big Bang). But there isn't anything there." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't necessary, Gott said this week, because his research shows that 
gravity alone could have led to the formation of structures like the Great 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not at all surprised by COBE," he said. "It is just what I would have 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Gott's research is based on the assumption that even in the earliest universe 
there would have been some slight fluctuation in the concentration of matter. 
At least one part in every 200,000 should have been a little different, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These (fluctuations) led to density fluctuations that can start to grow and 
they keep growing" because some areas would have slightly higher mass -- and 
thus stronger gravitational pull -- than others," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
Gott and Park used the Princeton computer to simulate what would have happened 
if the earliest universe had had even slight fluctuations in density. 
</P>
<P>
The computer was told to simulate the effect of gravity on 4 million particles 
over a slice of the universe 2 billion light-years across. The data included 
slight fluctuations in density, and the computer was programmed to follow the 
evolution of the particles for the equivalent of 13 billion years. It took the 
computer 14 hours to complete the task. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the simulated universe had reached the theoretical age of today's 
universe, the computer was spitting out images that Gott says "look 
astonishingly like the observations" of Geller and Huchra. 
</P>
<P>
While the Princeton findings are not as exotic as some theories offered by 
other cosmologists, the end result is "wonderful," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
"It means these superclusters (of galaxies) are fossil remnants of the pattern 
of fluctuations that existed in the early universe," he said. "It's our 
earliest look back at the beginning of the universe."

HISSES, MELODRAMA OVER THEATER'S FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Paul Normandin relives it, his wealthy parents simply wanted to create 
something of lasting value for the community when they bought the vintage 1927 
Carlsbad Theater, an aging monument to silent movies and vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandins eagerly planned to spruce up the cavernous movie house, 
originally built to hold 600 patrons, and proudly preside over a Renaissance of 
local entertainment that would range from stage performances to films. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is dreams," poeticized Paul Normandin, who acts as spokesman for his 
parents, Raymond and Celestine. 
</P>
<P>
But now, only three years after the Normandins paid $370,000 for the 
Spanish-style landmark that once stood alone in a bean field of pre-growth 
Carlsbad, the family is threatening to demolish it and walk away in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
That's unless the city, through its redevelopment program, hurriedly comes to 
the Normandins' rescue by either taking the downtown theater off their hands or 
helping pay up to $2.6 million for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, cold and looking haunted, the theater has been profitless since the city 
fire marshal ordered it closed in August, 1988 for being a fire hazard and 
violating building codes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't own this building," Normandin said sarcastically. "We just manage it 
for the city until government figures out what they want to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials, irritated over being painted as bad guys, say the 
Normandins bought into their own misery and are trying through 
misrepresentation to pressure the city into bailing them out financially. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what the hell he was doing when he bought it," said Marty Orenyak, 
city director of community development, who claims that the owners actually 
have made the theater less safe than it was when they acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, these are not the golden years for the theater at 2822 State St. that 
once boasted a Robert Morton pipe organ, lazy Sunday matinees and decorative 
side murals of North County scenes. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression, townsfolk couldn't support the theater, but the newly 
arrived Army and Navy Academy rented it as a drama classroom and for staged 
performances. Within a few years, it reverted to private ownership and was used 
as a movie theater from 1946 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
It lapsed back to stage performances until the late '60s, when a new audience, 
the area's Latino community, was entertained by Spanish-language movies until 
the theater was sold to the Normandins in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This was bought emotionally by my parents," said Paul Normandin. "They thought 
it would be a way of doing something for the community." 
</P>
<P>
He said his parents, who did well in real estate, were "under the impression" 
that the theater could still be used for plays. 
</P>
<P>
Although some performances were staged under the Normandin's stewardship, city 
building inspectors and the fire marshal took an increasingly critical interest 
in such activities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Normandin's version of events, there were repeated requirements to 
upgrade the theater to make it comply with codes, until finally, the fire 
marshal shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the earlier Spanish movie audiences, Normandin said "you could put 
500 Mexicans in the theater and that's OK, but you stage Neil Simon and that's 
a fire problem. I call it selective enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
On this issue, city officials accuse Normandin of distortion. 
</P>
<P>
Orenyak claims the city went along with the family's desire to offer plays, but 
insisted that certain deficiencies such as the theater's electrical problems 
and blocked exits first be remedied. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't laying on 100,000 things to do, we just wanted to make it safe," 
Orenyak said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Normandins did complete some repairs, but then upset fire officials 
by building a wooden extension of the existing stage. "They expanded the stage 
out. It was unprotected wood. It was a fire trap." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Marshal Mike Smith said, "The problem is, the building was obviously 
designed back in the '20s to handle live theater productions. It met the code 
requirements of that day." 
</P>
<P>
Smith credits the Normandins with trying to upgrade the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think they were making an effort to make that place work," he said. 
"Unfortunately, it's going to take some funds to rehabilitate the theater to 
the point it can handle live theater on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
Movies create less of a problem because, unlike stage productions, they require 
no potentially flammable sets and props with overhead lighting that could 
ignite a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is, the building is unsafe for the public if there are live 
performances in there," Smith said. "On that basis, we had to close it." 
</P>
<P>
The closure left the Normandins in a financial corner, and they put the 
Carlsbad Theater back on the market for a reported asking price of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they're pushing the city for a commitment and arguing that it would 
be a shame for the city to lose a historically significant building that could 
be turned into an entertainment boon. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the city to take us out of it and let the community have 
entertainment," said Normandin, later adding, "We make proposals, and they 
don't ever respond." 
</P>
<P>
He gets no sympathy from Orenyak, who believes that the city has been more than 
generous by paying for a $15,000 theater feasibility study by San Diego 
architect Wayne Donaldson. The report concludes it would cost $1.9 million to 
$2.6 million to renovate the theater, which 39 performing arts organizations 
contacted for the study suggested would be best used for plays and small 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
While Normandin waits, Orenyak is preparing a staff report that he indicated 
will oppose buying and restoring it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd personally like to see the theater restored and used, but you've got to 
look at it from a practical standpoint," Orenyak said. 
</P>
<P>
Key among those practical considerations is the city's limited redevelopment 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just spent $7 million to $8 million on a street-scape plan and, frankly, 
we don't have any money," he said. Further, Orenyak said he doesn't appreciate 
being leveraged by the owners, whose tactics he characterized as, "Look, the 
city's the bad guy. Look, I've got this beautiful theater and can do all these 
good things for Carlsbad, and the city won't spend money to do anything about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Markie, a real-estate agent who is trying to find other buyers for the 
property, acknowledges that there's "bad blood" between Paul Normandin and City 
Hall. He said the foul atmosphere is making it difficult to attract prospective 
purchasers, although "there's been 150 to 200 inquiries." 
</P>
<P>
He says the city might be delaying a decision on the theater to sweat the 
Normandins into a cut-rate sale. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got a building that costs several hundreds of thousands of dollars a 
year, the city can hold out and get their price," Markie said. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Normandin has vowed that the theater will be demolished by year's end 
if nothing happens fast. He argues that state law requires unreinforced masonry 
structures like the theater to be strengthened by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"That puts all my family's assets at risk. If there's an earthquake and 
somebody injured, they own us," said Normandin. Therefore, "We have to have the 
building torn down by end of this year." 
</P>
<P>
That argument doesn't impress Orenyak, who does agree that "it's an old 
building and requires some seismic retrofitting, and someday, he'll have to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But more immediately, Orenyak said, state law sets no deadline for making 
buildings earthquake safe and only requires unreinforced masonry structures to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The theater issue is expected to go before the city Housing and Redevelopment 
Advisory Committee, perhaps next month. In the meantime, Normandin is talking 
about organizing a city petition campaign to put city funding for the theater 
on the local ballot.

CODE VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT IS FOUND LAGGING; 
</P>
<P>
BUREAUCRACY: THE PACE OF PROSECUTIONS SLOWS TO A TRICKLE DUE IN PART TO 
REDUCTIONS IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Housing, building and zoning code enforcement in the city of San Diego is 
plagued by "extraordinary" delays and a huge backlog of cases, a situation 
exacerbated by a bottleneck in the city attorney's office, according to an 
independent study of city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70% of zoning cases not resolved by voluntary compliance took 2 1/2 
years or longer to process for legal action, according to the report by the San 
Diego Law Center of the University of San Diego School of Law. The $124,000 
study, released to council members and city staff this week, was jointly funded 
by the city and USD. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, City Atty. John Witt's code enforcement unit is allowing some cases 
to remain permanently unprosecuted because of staff cutbacks that took effect 
July 1. Cases that do not present significant health and safety issues are 
routinely being returned to the investigators who prepared them. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who want to abuse the system, frankly, they can," said Michael 
Shames, the study's author. "The system can be easily manipulated by those 
people who are a little less scrupulous." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no end to the case. There's no results," said Daniel Morales, an aide 
to Councilman Wes Pratt, who handles citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Continued neglect of the violations leads to "the slow erosion of the housing 
stock or the buildings or the infrastructure of the community," Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
A bright note in the study is the early performance of the city's Dispute 
Resolution Office, an 4-month-old experiment in settling cases between the city 
and violators with the help of volunteer mediators. The office resolved all but 
two of the 65 cases that came before it. 
</P>
<P>
Shames recommends continuation of the alternative process as a way of relieving 
some of the burden on the city agencies. He and others also have been pursuing 
creation of a special Municipal Court devoted entirely to code matters, but so 
far they have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The study also notes that complaints lodged with council members are resolved 
much more quickly than calls directly to the enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning investigators respond to complaints about illegal dwelling units, 
businesses operating in residential zones, structures under construction, 
garage conversions, junk and debris, illegally parked and abandoned cars, 
over-height fences and satellite antennas. 
</P>
<P>
Building inspectors respond to land-use and noise complaints, including 
buildings without permits, unsafe and dangerous buildings, and unpermitted 
construction work. The agency's housing division enforces space and occupancy 
permits for homes, and complaints about "habitability requirements" such as 
plumbing, heating, electrical equipment and sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
The system is plagued by the huge backlog, delays, low morale, a "computer data 
base system resembling the Tower of Babel," a large increase in cases since 
1985, over-reliance on the judicial system and "inconsistent handling" of cases 
by Municipal Court judges, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, departmental policies and prosecution delays have allowed a 
buildup of unresolved cases with little prospect for resolution without 
meaningful reforms," the study notes. As of Dec. 1, 1989, Zoning Investigations 
has a backlog of approximately 2,600 cases that are more than six months old. 
Similarly, Building Inspection reports a case backlog approximating 2,000 
pending cases. 
</P>
<P>
Once cases are referred to the City Attorney's office, "it generally took 18 
months" before a court ordered compliance or the case was returned to the 
inspector, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Flynn, deputy planning director, said that zoning investigators resolve 95% 
of their cases without the need to go to court. When legal action is necessary, 
due process requirements slow procedure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likening his predicament to the city's decision to increase its police force 
without providing more jail space, Joseph Schilling, the deputy city attorney 
in charge of code enforcement, said that his staff has grown more slowly than 
the code enforcement staff. The attorneys have fallen further and further 
behind, even before Schilling's 10-person unit was reduced by 3.5 positions 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"While the other departments have doubled or tripled their staffs, even before 
there was a (budget) cut, we had not grown as rapidly. Even if there hadn't 
been a cut, we'd still be scurrying around here trying to take the cases to 
court," Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the budget cuts, the legal unit "can really only focus on the health and 
safety violations" or those that have a significant impact on surrounding 
neighbors. The attorneys have sent 70 cases back to the city departments and 
are accepting far fewer new ones for prosecution, Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect for additional help in the coming fiscal year is dim. City Manager 
John Lockwood said that the city must raise $66 million in additional revenue 
just to keep city services at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
"There will have to be cuts in almost every service the city provides just to 
balance next year's budget," Lockwood said. The City Council is scheduled to 
discuss its budget crunch Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with such realities, inspectors "begin to feel like the INS inspectors at 
the Mexico border -- 'Why should I be putting in all this effort when it's not 
going to go to court for 2 1/2 years,' " Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the special court, which has proved successful in other cities, 
the report recommends better computerization, more training for inspectors, 
assigning priorities to cases, establishment of fees and fines that would pay 
for code enforcement staff, the use of volunteers and changes in the municipal 
codes to make enforcement more efficient.

'ROSEY' GRIER TACKLES SOCIAL SERVICE NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roosevelt Grier, who starred as a defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams, is 
joining the San Diego County administrative staff as a special assistant to 
give a helping hand running a spectrum of social services programs, county 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although best known for his crushing tackles, Grier has also received 
recognition for founding and operating community service programs since ending 
his 12-year football career in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
According to Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative officer, Grier 
will serve on his staff as a special assistant and participate in a variety of 
programs, ranging from those that help underprivileged youth to programs that 
assist senior citizens. Grier also may be asked to help defuse the county's 
growing gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosey Grier is a humanitarian," Hickey said in a statement released Wednesday. 
"He has repeatedly demonstrated a unique capability to interface with virtually 
every facet of humanity, even those who have become splintered from society." 
</P>
<P>
Hickey and Grier are both Penn State University alumni. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been determined how long Grier will work for the county, Lerner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a part-time position to be determined at the pleasure of the CAO," Lerner 
said, referring to the chief administrative officer. "It may go beyond a year, 
it might be less." Grier is due in San Diego today to make things final, Lerner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how long he works, Lerner said, Grier will be placed on the 
county government payroll and receive a sum based on a $50,000-a-year salary. 
Grier may be put on the payroll as early as Friday, Lerner added. 
</P>
<P>
Grier is expected to work with the county's social service and probation 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Williams, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, described Grier in 
the statement as "a good role model whose presence in our ethnically diverse 
county will be an asset to our ongoing efforts to promote positive social 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Grier is the founder and director of a federally funded program designed to 
give job training to disadvantaged youth. He is also the founder and chairman 
of a program aimed at helping inner-city youth improve their self-esteem and 
assists them in finding better educational and employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Grier began his football career with the New York Giants (1955-62), where he 
was named as an All-Pro defensive tackle in 1956.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 54-year-old man has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for producing 
sexually explicit videotapes and photos of children and for trying to bring the 
materials into the United States, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Enright sentenced Richard Helwig, 54, of San 
Francisco, to the 14-year term on Tuesday, Asst. U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Joan P. Weber said. Helwig had been convicted last September of two 
pornography-related charges and a third count of jumping bail after his initial 
arrest, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
Helwig was arrested last March at the San Ysidro border crossing when U.S. 
Customs officials found more than 130 photos showing children in sexually 
explicit poses, Weber said. Officers also found photographic film and 
videotapes that depicted a small girl in explicit poses, Weber said. Through 
papers found in Helwig's camper, customs agents traced the girl -- who turned 
out to be 9 years old and deaf -- to a small village near the Mexican resort of 
Puerto Vallarta where Helwig lived part-time, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
Helwig was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison for the central 
charge against him, formally called "sexual exploitation of children," Weber 
said. Enright imposed a separate three-year term for transporting material 
involving the sexual exploitation of children and another separate term, one 
year, for bail jumping, Weber said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury found a jail inmate guilty Wednesday of second-degree murder in the 
beating death of another prisoner in the South Bay jail in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberating one day, the San Diego Superior Court jury convicted Steve 
Edward Morrison, 39, of San Diego, in the May 7, 1989, death of Luis Jose Mena, 
45. 
</P>
<P>
Mena was attacked on April 14, 1989, and suffered brain damage and a skull 
fracture, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Evan Miller. Mena died three and a 
half weeks later in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the motive for the attack was Morrison's hatred of child molesters. 
Mena had been convicted of molestation in 1985 and was back in jail on a parole 
violation when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison was in jail at the time on a burglary charge and suspicion of 
violating parole, as he too has other felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Morrison faces a maximum sentence of 20 years to life in state 
prison, if he gets extra time for having prior felony offenses.

A U.S. Border Patrol chase of a suspected smuggler of illegal aliens ended in a 
crash Wednesday evening that injured eight people. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Garcia Vargas, 17, was arrested on smuggling charges, Border Patrol 
spokesman Ted Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford said that three pickup trucks drove across the border through a hole 
in a fence about half a mile west of the port of entry. Two of the trucks 
returned to Mexico, but the 1974 pickup going about 55 m.p.h. led Border Patrol 
officers on a chase from Otay Mesa Road to Airway Road. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford said that Vargas was at a stoplight on Airway Road about 7:40 p.m., 
attempting to make an illegal left turn, when he broadsided a Ford Mustang. 
Vargas was arrested shortly after he and two of the people fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 17 people in the pickup and three people from the car suffered 
minor injuries.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 9 CITY BUILDINGS TO GET DOORKNOBS FOR 
DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council last week approved replacing standard twist-style 
doorknobs with special levers on 121 doors in nine city buildings to help 
disabled people gain greater access. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude sponsored the motion, saying traditional doorknobs are 
difficult for people in wheelchairs to open. Doorknobs will be converted in all 
three downtown City Hall buildings, the Van Nuys City Hall and municipal 
buildings in San Pedro, Watts, Sunland-Tujunga, West Los Angeles and the West 
Valley at an anticipated cost of $27,781.

JURY AWARDS HOMELESS CENTER $14.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Vincent de Paul/Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless was awarded $14.6 
million Tuesday in a lawsuit filed against its neighbor, California Linen 
Supply. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to cover what the center already has spent and will continue to 
spend in order to treat ground water contaminated by dry-cleaning chemicals 
that seeped from underground storage tanks at the property next door. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you walk out of the courtroom with a check in your hand," said 
Father Joe Carroll, founder and director of the 350-bed facility. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, during construction of the center at 1501 Imperial Ave., a spark from 
a drill caused an explosion, alerting Carroll to the possibility that ground 
water flowing onto the property was contaminated by chemicals used by the 
dry-cleaning operation, which had been operating since 1905. 
</P>
<P>
The award follows four years of litigation to get California Linen to clean up 
its property, said Brian D. Monaghan, attorney for the homeless center. 
Monaghan said the center has spent about $152,000 in four years for monthly 
testing of the ground water and soil. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the city has permitted the center to pump the contaminated water 
and divert it into the municipal sewage system. The cost to the center has 
ranged between $500 and $1,000 a month, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the center will have to dig a series of wells to monitor and 
capture the water and set up a treatment system for the water before it is 
released into the bay. The cost of that has been estimated between $3.4 and 
$5.6 million, Monaghan said. The contaminated ground water has put the center 
in debt for about $1 million, Carroll said. The center runs medical, 
educational and employment programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury decided there was a total of $22.7 million in damages, 
Monaghan said. But the jury divided responsibility for the damages, allotting 
the center one third of the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we should have tested the soil for contaminants before we built (the 
center)," Monaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining damages are to be shouldered by California Linen Supply and its 
parent company, Service Control Corp., which acquired the property from Balloon 
Cleaners and Dye Works in 1985. The company contended during the trial that it 
did not run the dry-cleaning operation after it acquired the property, Monaghan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said California Linen removed three tanks from its property which were 
between 30 and 40 years old. Two of those tanks were leaking petroleum 
hydrocarbons. The size of the tanks were in dispute during the trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Records submitted to the San Diego Fire Department by California Linen 
indicated that the tanks had capacities of 1,000 and 3,000 gallons. But, 
Monaghan said, a California Linen consultant, testified that the company's 
chief engineer told her the capacities of the tanks were 5,000 and 8,000 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Records for the site are incomplete, Monaghan said. His own expert estimated 
there were about 7,000 gallons of petroleum hydrocarbons at the site.

Chemicals found in the ground water were petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated 
hydrocarbons. Monaghan said the source of the chlorinated hydrocarbons were not 
determined at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Both chemicals are toxic, but the petroleum hydrocarbons are explosive when 
they vaporize, Monaghan said. That fact has made the property uninsurable for 
damages caused by explosion.

FIRM PROMISES CLOSER CHECKS OF BUS DRIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: LAIDLAW TRANSIT IS TAKING THE ACTION AFTER THE ARREST ON DRUNK-DRIVING 
CHARGES OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO ALLEGEDLY USED AN ALIAS TO HIDE PREVIOUS ARRESTS.

<P>
The company that employed a school bus driver arrested at an Encino elementary 
school last month on charges of driving while drunk has told school officials 
it will do a better job of investigating job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver, Harold Keith Lone, was employed by Laidlaw Transit and 
transported Los Angeles students under the company's contract with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. Lone used a license obtained under an alias 
enabling him to conceal a long criminal history and a driving record that 
included at least four convictions for drunk driving, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw, reported to school 
officials this week on his investigation of the incident in which Lone was 
arrested with a blood-alcohol content triple that allowed under state law. Lone 
had been seen driving erratically by another motorist Jan. 16 and was waiting 
to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In the most important procedural change, Daley said, Laidlaw will ask 
applicants about the date their driver's license was issued and about any 
previous driver's licenses they might have held, even in other states. 
</P>
<P>
Such questions, Daley said, might have exposed Lone's ruse because the 
California driving record he submitted with his application went back only two 
years. He used a forged birth certificate to obtain a license under the name 
Harold Keith Holmes after his legitimate license was suspended for an earlier 
drunk driving conviction, state Department of Justice officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Had Lone's background been known, he would not have been hired last fall, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person is lying to you, and pushing 40, like this guy was, and you make 
them explain where they have been licensed to drive, then you're able to follow 
up a little more on their background," Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the things I saw from our procedures, that's the one, if . . . followed 
up with by questions in the interview, it might have turned this situation 
around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert W. Dunevant, head of transportation for the school district, said he had 
not seen Daley's report and would review it today. But he agreed that several 
of the company's planned changes would be an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It might avoid a Lone-Holmes situation, provided the information can be 
obtained," Dunevant said. Dunevant said the company's plan to expand its 
personal reference checks, especially of people claiming to be self-employed, 
would also be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
When Lone applied for a job with Laidlaw last July he told company officials 
that he was a self-employed handyman. The company sent reference check forms to 
two previous employers but got no response. Under Laidlaw's new procedures, the 
company will ask applicants claiming to be self-employed for the names of three 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state Department of Justice has completed fingerprint checks on 
about half of the 620 bus drivers in the state who, like Lone, were driving 
under temporary certificates issued by the California Highway Patrol. As a 
result of the Lone incident, the department agreed to expedite its review of 
those drivers' applications for permanent bus driver licenses. 
</P>
<P>
No results of those reviews are yet available. 
</P>
<P>
The Highway Patrol is also considering revamping its procedures for issuing 
temporary certificates so that few, if any, drivers would need them. The 
temporary certificates are issued prior to obtaining the results of a 
fingerprint check. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, school officials are continuing to investigate a report that a 
parent had complained last fall that Lone arrived at a school late because he 
stopped the bus at a liquor store and left students unattended.

HOSPITAL CAN'T LIMIT EMERGENCY CARE TO GARDENA RESIDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: COUNTY RULES OUT GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITS ON EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOSPITAL 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY CAN'T AFFORD UNRESTRICTED PARAMEDIC SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
County health officials have told Gardena city officials and administrators at 
Memorial Hospital of Gardena that the hospital cannot limit emergency services 
to Gardena residents only. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has asked the county for permission to downgrade its emergency 
room from basic to standby status and to stop accepting paramedic patients. At 
a meeting Monday, city and hospital officials proposed retaining full emergency 
services for Gardena residents, but county officials said such selectivity 
would violate the policies of the county's Emergency Medical Services system. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with what Gardena proposed -- to carve out a specific service area 
-- is that it sets a precedent," said Virginia Price-Hastings, who oversees the 
county's paramedic operations. "Other hospitals would want to follow suit, but 
that would leave us with large (geographic) areas uncovered. We can't permit 
something to go in that leaves large population bases uncovered." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Price-Hastings said, state regulations require ambulances to 
transport patients to the closest emergency room equipped to handle the 
emergency, and they also require that paramedics take patients to a hospital 
with a basic emergency room. If a basic emergency room is open at the Gardena 
hospital, it must be available to the entire EMS system, not just to local 
residents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial Hospital Administrator George Rooth said the number of non-paying 
emergency cases forced officials to request that the emergency room at the 
private, 200-bed hospital be downgraded from basic to standby status. Emergency 
services would still be available for walk-in patients and private ambulances 
that are not used for paramedic calls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It could be another 30 to 60 days before the hospital's request is approved and 
paramedic service is halted, officials said. Centinela Hospital Medical Center 
in Inglewood downgraded its emergency room and closed its doors to paramedic 
services last May. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial Hospital of Gardena "wants to provide service in its own community," 
Rooth said, "but we can't provide services to the indigent population using us 
as primary care from outside the area. We're willing to absorb some losses from 
our community, but not from the broader area." 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena Fire Department has only one fully equipped paramedic unit, said 
Administrative Battalion Chief Ralph Mailloux. 
</P>
<P>
A paramedic assessment unit, added last year, can handle most emergencies but 
cannot administer heart medication or drug therapy, Mailloux said. 
</P>
<P>
Downgrading Memorial Hospital "has the potential to cause our only full 
paramedic squad to be unavailable due to longer transportation time. . . . Our 
squad will be unavailable more, so we'll be relying on our assessment engine," 
Mailloux said. 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said it might be possible for the hospital to receive funds 
under Proposition 99, which provides money from a tax on tobacco for a number 
of health services, including treatment for patients who are unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
But Rooth said Proposition 99 money "is not sufficient to make us decide in 
favor of continuing business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's meeting, county and city officials said they plan to meet again 
in two weeks to discuss other possibilities for retaining some emergency 
services at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Rooth said he hopes that "a good solution can be worked out for the city and 
the hospital."

HERITAGE PANEL PAYS LANDMARK VISIT TO CHURCH; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: OFFICIALS LOOK AT A FORMER THEATER THAT NEARBY HOMEOWNERS WANT 
DECLARED A MONUMENT. CHURCH MEMBERS WANT TO SELL IT INSTEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Members of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission went to church 
Wednesday, but not to pray. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners paid a quick visit to the former Valley Music Theatre in 
Woodland Hills, which is a Jehovah's Witness assembly hall. The panel inspected 
the facility in response to the wishes of homeowner activists who want the 
25-year-old dome-shaped building preserved as a historical monument. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' tactics resembled those of a group of Studio City homeowners 
who unsuccessfully tried last year to get the commission to declare a carwash 
at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards a historical monument. In both cases, 
the homeowners' aim was to prevent large projects from replacing the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn. fears that the former music theater, built 
as a showcase for Broadway-style musicals in 1964, will be torn down and 
replaced by apartments or condominiums. At least two development firms have 
shown interest in purchasing the property, according to the office of 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. Commission President Amarjit 
S. Marwah, Vice President Takashi Shida and board member Reynaldo Landero were 
briefly escorted through the facility by church board member John Genovese and 
attorney Michael J. Kron, who represents the church. The commissioners asked 
several questions about the history of the facility and its present operations 
but did not closely inspect the building. 
</P>
<P>
Genovese told the commissioners that it had become too expensive to heat the 
2,900-seat theater and that parking space was inadequate for the current 
membership. He said church officials had purchased property in the Santa 
Clarita Valley and were planning to move operations there. 
</P>
<P>
Marwah said the five-member board will consider whether the building should be 
designated a landmark at its Feb. 14 meeting. "We have to see more history and 
do more research before we make a decision," he said. "We would like to hear 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Kron and Genovese said the building does not deserve monument status. 
</P>
<P>
In applying for the designation, leaders of the homeowner group said the 
building should be saved because it resembles the Pacific Theater Cinerama Dome 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling theater operated for years as a theater-in-the-round. Before the 
Music Center went bankrupt and was sold to the Jehovah's Witnesses in the late 
1970s, entertainers such as Robert Goulet, Mitzi Gaynor and Art Linkletter 
performed there, according to homeowner leaders. 
</P>
<P>
If the auditorium receives monument status, it would be the youngest official 
landmark in Los Angeles, replacing the 22-foot-tall Tower of Wooden Pallets, 
built in 1951 in the back yard of a Van Nuys home.

PHONE NUMBER DELIVERS CLUE ON PIZZA ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man was in jail Wednesday after he allegedly robbed a delivery 
woman of three pizzas but left Los Angeles sheriff's deputies a key clue -- his 
phone number. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron James, 23, was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery before the stolen 
pizzas were even eaten, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were still looking for a teen-age girl Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, Mary Brown, 34, attempted to deliver three pizzas 
from Domino's Pizza to a home in the 44300 block of Rawdon Avenue in Lancaster 
but the occupants had not ordered the pizzas. When she returned to the delivery 
truck, she was robbed of the pizzas by a man who threatened to stab her and by 
a teen-age girl, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown surrendered the pizzas and returned to the Domino's store on East Avenue 
J to report the robbery. Deputies learned that a store employee had routinely 
noted the phone number of the person who ordered the pizza, and the number was 
traced to a house on Downsview Road, behind the house where the robbery 
occurred, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
There deputies found the pizzas and James, whom Brown identified as the robber. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a total loss," Shreves said. "The pizzas hadn't been eaten." 
</P>
<P>
James was being held in lieu of $8,500 bail at the sheriff's Antelope Valley 
station in Lancaster. Deputies had not identified the girl who took part in the 
robbery, Shreves said.

LANCASTER MAYOR WON'T RUN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster Mayor Lynn Harrison announced Wednesday that she will not run for a 
third City Council term in the April city elections because she plans to take a 
full-time job in the private sector and wants to spend more time with her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison's decision a day before the filing deadline creates a second potential 
open seat in the elections for three council posts. 
</P>
<P>
The election promises to be crowded and center on issues related to the city's 
explosive growth in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other incumbents, Councilman Els Groves has said he would not run for 
reelection. Councilman Arnie Rodio has filed papers to run for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
Council members choose a new mayor from among themselves each year. Harrison, a 
housewife who recently earned a license as a real estate broker, was first 
elected to the council in 1982 and reelected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I am at a crossroads," said Harrison. "I have carefully weighed my personal 
needs and my family's needs in the balance with further public service. . . . 
I've decided not to seek reelection at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 40, a mother of two, said that after a divorce more than a year ago 
it became apparent that she needed to weigh the part-time council job against 
the need for full-time work. She said she has received job offers in real 
estate and as an office manager. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said she felt she would have had a good chance at reelection. But 
several homeowner activists said she would have faced stiff challenges along 
with other incumbents because of dissatisfaction among voters with traffic, 
school crowding and other issues blamed on the city's rapid growth.

PROGRESS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN IS MIXED BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A progress report on Inglewood's affirmative action program this week said 
minority- and women-owned businesses are well represented in some types of city 
contracts but are disappointingly low in others. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give us an A but I can't give us a failing grade, either," Shirley 
Williams, the city's employee relations and personnel director, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the city is making an effort, and we're succeeding in many areas." 
</P>
<P>
The progress report presented to the City Council on Tuesday said 63.7% of 
large city-funded construction contracts totaling more than $1 million went to 
minority- and women-owned firms. About 14% of the construction contracts of 
less than $25,000 went to such firms, for a total of about $92,000. The report 
covered an 18-month period from April, 1988, to October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Participation in service contracts was 19%, or $901,000. But participation in 
procurement contracts was less than 1% and confined primarily to purchases of 
less than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said participation by minority groups and women in procurement 
contracts is the primary area that is lagging behind. 
</P>
<P>
She said the city sent notification of upcoming bids to minority- and 
women-owned firms but very few businesses applied. In an attempt to encourage 
participation, city officials have sent letters to find out why the response 
rate was so low. 
</P>
<P>
The city's affirmative action policy does not specify any percentage targets 
for participation by minority groups and women. It states that the city should 
encourage participation by minority- and women-owned businesses in all city 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always room for improvement, but we are on track," Councilman Jose 
Fernandez said. "We want all members of the community to participate in city 
contracts."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL VOTE DELAYED ON WARNER RIDGE ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of Councilwoman Joy Picus, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Wednesday delayed until Feb. 6 a second and final vote on a plan to zone the 
Warner Ridge property for residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, who represents the West Valley, sought postponement because the absence 
of allied council members left her without the votes she needed to approve her 
plan to zone the controversial property to permit residential development only. 
</P>
<P>
Picus needed 10 votes, but only eight of her 10 council supporters were 
present. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was confident she could muster sufficient votes on Tuesday, when 
all 15 council members are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council backed Picus and voted 10-2 to zone developer Albert 
Spound's property at Oxnard Street and De Soto Avenue to allow the construction 
of 108 large houses. Spound was seeking a zoning change to permit him to 
construct seven office structures, with 810,000 square feet of space, on the 
parcel.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DUMPING EXTENDED IN SUNSHINE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to allow dumping to continue 
until March 1 in the southern area of the controversial Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The council is currently permitting the landfill owner, Browning-Ferris 
Industries, to operate in the southern portion of the canyon on a 
month-to-month basis as long as BFI shows it is taking steps to move all of its 
dumping operations to the northern end of the dump by June 30, said Greig 
Smith, chief deputy to Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson has been seeking to close the landfill adjacent to Granada Hills. Two 
weeks ago, Los Angeles County Public Works Department officials urged that the 
existing 230-acre landfill be expanded to permit dumping on 542 acres of 
BFI-owned land in an unincorporated part of the county.

<TEXT>
<P>
An Arleta man charged with the contract killing of a man who had arranged an 
earlier contract killing surrendered to authorities Wednesday, Los Angeles 
police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Ray Edwards, 38, walked into the Foothill Division police station in 
Pacoima about 10 a.m. and told officers he was wanted in a murder 
investigation, Detective Michael Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had been charged a day earlier with murdering James Bernstein, 26, of 
Reseda last June 27. Authorities said Edwards and Paul Edwin Gaul, 26, of 
Sylmar, lured Bernstein to a remote part of Ventura County and killed him. 
Bernstein's decomposed body was found the following month and authorities have 
declined to say how he is believed to have been killed.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sun Valley man was found stabbed to death in his bed Wednesday, apparently 
after a break-in, Los Angeles police reported. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Ellis Kellel-Sophiea, 38, was found dead in his home in the 9700 block 
of Orcas Avenue, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellel-Sophiea was found about 3:15 a.m. by his wife, who had been sleeping in 
another room, Ferrand said. The wife and a 6-year-old daughter, whose 
identities were not released, apparently had not heard the attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that someone forced their way into the home, but we don't 
know why," Ferrand said. There was no indication that anything had been taken, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were unable to determine if Kellel-Sophiea was attacked in his sleep or 
had fought his assailant.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE SUES FIRMS OVER RAT IN INSTANT SOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Markets has pulled all Nissin Food products from its stores because a 
woman charged in a lawsuit that she found part of a rat in a Cup O'Noodles she 
purchased at a Canyon Country supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Harland Polk, vice president of sales for Hughes Markets, said the chain's 
shelves were stripped of nearly 1,000 cases of Nissin products -- including Cup 
O'Noodles, Top Ramen and Ramen Classic -- Tuesday morning as a precaution until 
the incident is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based chain has 47 stores in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and 
San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to Nissin to determine what to do about the allegation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes and Nissin were named in a lawsuit filed Friday in San Fernando Superior 
Court by Robert and Sharon Mathie, who purchased a Cup O'Noodles Oriental on 
Jan. 6 at a Hughes Market on Soledad Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, while sharing the meal with her 4-year-old daughter, she discovered 
a rat in the cup, the suit said. Mathie and her husband said in the suit that 
they did not eat the noodle soup, but the emotional trauma of the discovery has 
made it difficult for them to work ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no knowledge of this incident," said Mike Sakai, manager of marketing 
for Nissin Foods. "I don't see how it could happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Polk and Sakai said their companies had not received legal notification of the 
suit, which they learned of from reporters. The Mathies never complained to the 
companies, they said.

IKEBANA CLUB HELPS JAPANESE LIFE BLOOM FOR YOUNG STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MEMBERS OF A LOCAL FLOWER CLUB TEACH ELEMENTARY STUDENTS ABOUT 
ANOTHER CULTURE BY RECREATING PORTIONS OF ROOMS AND PERFORMING A TEA CEREMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1975, Grace Brophy did a favor for friends and gave a San Diego elementary 
school class a quick lesson in Japanese culture. That favor has since turned 
into an annual countywide event. 
</P>
<P>
Brophy is a member of the San Diego chapter of Ikebana International, a 
nonprofit cultural organization based in Tokyo that promotes the study of 
Japanese floral art. Its motto is "Friendship Through Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Brophy said that 15 years ago friends asked her to present a program at their 
child's school, the former Farnum Elementary School in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe the reaction we got," Brophy said. "We were there from 9 
a.m. to after 2 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
Because it was so successful, the organization set up an authentic Japanese 
setting in another school. In 1979, the first program funded by the school 
district was presented in the Chula Vista School District and later in San 
Diego and Poway elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
When the school district ran out of money for the program, Ikebana packed up 
its props, costumes, and artifacts and, using its own money, started going to 
schools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
For four days this week, the library at Murdock Elementary School in La Mesa 
was turned into a traditional Japanese setting as the school played host to the 
organization, which seeks to teach students about the Japanese culture through 
experiences unavailable in school. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt a need for cultural understanding between nations," Brophy said. 
</P>
<P>
Takeko Davis, an ikebana master, helped with the translations for the students, 
who sat on the floor of the library, which was decorated with Japanese masks, 
dolls, and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the room the tokonoma area depicted an alcove in a Japanese 
house with a scroll on the wall and a flower arrangement that is changed with 
the seasons, Davis said. Next to it hung a replica of a samurai. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you visit a Japanese home you would come by the area and admire it," 
Brophy said. "You would say something about the area before sitting down for 
tea. Shoes are not worn in the house because the floors are made of floor mats 
or tatami." 
</P>
<P>
A map of Japan faced the students, and a silk wedding robe with silk and gold 
threads flanked another wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to immerse the children in Japanese culture to increase multicultural 
understanding," said Paul Schnaubelt, who teaches a combined third- and 
fourth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohayo gozaimasu?" asked Brophy, bowing before the class. "This means good 
morning. . . . It sounds like Ohio. A teacher is very important in Japanese 
culture, so you bow very low. Girls place their hands in front of themselves 
when they bow, and the boys place theirs to their sides when they bow." 
</P>
<P>
A list of simple Japanese phrases and numbers from 1 to 10 was displayed. 
Counting was easiest for the students: 
</P>
<P>
"Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, hichi, hachi, ku, ju," they proudly repeated. 
</P>
<P>
But, saying "you are welcome" was the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
"One more time," Davis said to the almost silent class. "Say doitashimashite." 
</P>
<P>
Brophy rescued the eager 9- and 10-year-olds by teaching them a trick to learn 
the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
"Say, don't touch my mustache," she said, followed by snickers from the class. 
</P>
<P>
She also reminded them never to say the mustache phrase in public, and that it 
is used only as a teaching method. 
</P>
<P>
Brophy told the students that their Japanese counterparts carry expensive 
leather bags or backpacks, which are usually gifts from grandparents, to 
school. The bag is important because it rains a lot. 
</P>
<P>
In the leather school bag, lunch is carried in a small box with a tight lid. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be a sandwich and fruit, or rice and egg roll, chopsticks, and a 
small plastic container for soy sauce," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
A baseball cap, red on one side and white on the other, was taken out of the 
bag. The color displayed tells which team a student is training with that day. 
</P>
<P>
When Brophy told the class that children in Japan go to school six days a week, 
the response was underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh boy," sighed one boy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis then showed the class a first-grade picture book. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, we start from the back and read from back to front, from top to 
bottom, and from left to right." 
</P>
<P>
A soroban, which looks like an abacus and is still used in Japan, was shown to 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, we don't let our children use calculators in class, but that's all 
that is," Schnaubelt said. 
</P>
<P>
And most Japanese wear Western-style clothing, but traditional clothing is 
still worn for special occasions, such as weddings, house parties or festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Marj Jain, a volunteer, explained to the class how to sit at a Japanese dinner 
table, which is the center of several activities. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's time for refreshments, or time to play games, the family and guests 
get on their knees, cross their big toes and sit on their legs," Jain said. 
</P>
<P>
"What foods do the Japanese people eat?" Brophy asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish," yelled one student. 
</P>
<P>
"And why do you think they eat fish?" asked Brophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we do," answered another boy, ignoring the realities of Japan's long 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
After the visit, the class turned around for a toy demonstration. The favorite 
toy seemed to be the daruma, which represents the head of a Buddhist priest 
without eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Each time Brophy knocked it over, it would bounce back upright. It symbolizes 
the tale of a Buddhist priest who supposedly meditated on his knees for nine 
years and lost his legs, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The saying in Japan is, "No matter how many times you fall down, you get back 
up," Davis continued. "The toy doesn't have eyes because you paint the left eye 
in and make a wish. When the wish comes true, you paint in the other eye."

PAIR ARRESTED IN AERIAL BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man celebrated his 25th birthday by climbing to the top of a 
200-foot construction crane in Burbank with a friend Wednesday and sharing a 
bottle of schnapps, a party that ended when police arrested them. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Holguin, whose birthday was Tuesday, and Bryan Petri, also 25, of 
Canoga Park, were arrested on suspicion of trespassing about 1 a.m. after a 
police officer and a firefighter climbed part way up the crane at a 
construction site at 1st Street N and Angeleno Avenue and ordered them down. 
</P>
<P>
They were released on $250 bail. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a spur-of-the-moment thing," said Holguin, an electrician. "We walked 
out of a nightclub nearby and saw the tower. We looked at each other and said, 
'I dare you.' About halfway up we could see the police station a couple blocks 
away and thought maybe it wasn't such a good idea. But we kept going to the 
top." 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan said I didn't have the nerve to do it and I don't like to be 
challenged," added Petri, who works in the pressroom of the Los Angeles Times 
plant in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Although Holguin and Petri said they had been drinking, police said there was 
no indication the men were intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a bottle of peach schnapps up with us," Holguin said. "We left it up 
there -- empty." 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said the two men climbed over a fence surrounding the 
construction site and climbed a ladder attached to the crane's arm. The men 
were making their way to the top of the crane when police began receiving calls 
from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the guy's birthday and they thought it was a good way of 
celebrating," Goldberg said. "I guess they didn't have anything else to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a foolish stunt. It was raining and the steps could have been 
slippery." 
</P>
<P>
Police lighted the crane with searchlights and an officer and a firefighter 
using safety harnesses climbed partway up and called to the men. After Holguin 
and Petri climbed down, the firefighter climbed all the way to the top to make 
sure no one remained.

why he decided to climb a 200-foot construction crane on his birthday with his 
friend, Bryan Petri. The pair, who decided to attempt the prank after leaving a 
nightclub, came down after police flooded the crane with searchlights and 
called on them to come down. GEORGE WILHELM / Los Angeles Times; Photo, An

SAN DIEGO COLLEGE NOTEBOOKGULLS DIDN'T TAKE THEIR BEST SHOT WHEN MAGAZINE TRIED 
TO DO SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For an upcoming story on the three-point shot in college basketball, Sports 
Illustrated sent Robert Beck to Golden Hall Saturday to photograph the U.S. 
International men's game against Southern Utah State College. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Ample opportunity for the right photo. USIU averages about 15 
three-point tries per game, SUSC about 16. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, Sports Illustrated had strobe lights above each basket that 
flashed each time Beck took a picture. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gary Zarecky said it affected the Gulls, one in particular. Kevin 
Bradshaw, the third-leading scorer in the nation (31.3-point average), made 
just four of 19 shots in the first half. He adjusted in the second and finished 
with 36 points on 11-of-34 shooting, leading USIU to a 109-97 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw has seven games remaining in the race for the scoring title. He 
probably will not catch Loyola Marymount's Bo Kimble (35.4) but has a shot at 
No. 2, Ohio's Dave Jamerson (32.7). 
</P>
<P>
But how much does it all mean to USIU, which is striving for national 
recognition? Bradshaw was listed in USA Today last week as playing for the 
University of Southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, too, that the Gulls are the fifth-highest scoring team in the nation, 
averaging 96.7 points. But of the 18 highest-scoring teams listed by the NCAA, 
the Gulls are the only one with a losing record (9-12). 
</P>
<P>
Now for a local view of the three-point shot, numbers you probably will not see 
in SI. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bradshaw has taken and made more three-pointers (58 of 169) than the entire 
University of San Diego team (57 of 141). 
</P>
<P>
 -- USIU has attempted 70 more than San Diego State, which has tried 119 more 
than USD. But the Toreros have the best percentage, having made 40.4% to USIU's 
34.1% and SDSU's 33.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USD's Pat Holbert has made 54.2% (26 of 48). For consideration to be among 
NCAA leaders, a player must have averaged 1.5 successful three-pointers per 
game. Had Holbert made one more of his attempts, he would have qualified and 
been at 56.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For the women, USD has made 40.7% (48 of 118). Opponents have both 
attempted and made one more over 19 games. SDSU, on the other hand, has made 
just three of 24 (12.5%). Its opponents have made 47 of 133 (35.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 -- USD forward Cathy Perkins had not attempted a three-point shot from 
December 1987 until Jan. 24 at Santa Clara. Before the game, she convinced 
assistant Brad Thomas she could shoot from beyond the 19-foot-9 arc. During the 
game, she convinced everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins made five of five and scored a career-high 17 points. In the next game 
against Santa Clara Saturday, she made one of two. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego has moved to No. 14 in the NCAA Division III men's basketball 
poll. The Tritons (15-4) were ranked 19th last week. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College's Camille Armijo leads the Golden State Athletic 
Conference in scoring (24.6 average) and assists (4.0). Tuesday, she scored 38 
points against Cal Baptist. Teammate Shannon Abrams is second in scoring at 
17.8 and first in rebounding at 11.3. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's Ron Hubbard leads the GSAC men in scoring averaging (21.6 points). 
Teammate Mike Flores, a graduate of Mt. Miguel, leads the conference in 
rebounding at 9.2 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage, top-ranked in the National Christian College Athletic 
Assn., is in the midst of its most difficult trip of the year. The Hawks, 2-0 
on the swing and 17-4 overall, play four more road games in five days in Salem, 
Ore., and Juneau, Sitka and Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Anchorage Tuesday was 0. In Juneau, it was 2 below and 
clear. Sitka, an island southeast of Juneau, didn't make the national listings. 
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the Spanish national baseball team have been working out at 
USD the past three weeks and will be joined by their teammates for an 
exhibition this afternoon at 1 at Cunningham Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Jake Molina, an assistant the past five years to USD Coach John Cunningham, is 
also Spain's national team coach and may be its Olympic coach in 1992. This 
past summer, he coached Spain to third in the European Championships and second 
in the International Friendship Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Spain plays at Point Loma Nazarene Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
So how did you spend your summer vacation? 
</P>
<P>
During the recent semester break, USD's Jose Luis Noriega went to the beach. Of 
course, it helps that he lives in Lima, Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, the No. 2-ranked U.S. men's college tennis player, took two weeks off 
from training and worked on his tan. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, he won Peru's national championship. 
</P>
<P>
He made it back in time to help USD defeat UC Riverside Saturday. Noriega then 
won in No. 1 singles against No. 3 UCLA, but the No. 17 Toreros lost, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday and Sunday, USD plays at No. 1 Stanford and at No. 4 Cal. Noriega then 
leaves for Minneapolis, where he will compete Feb. 7-10 in the U.S. Collegiate 
Indoor Championships, one of four college Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega won the Clay Court Championships, another Grand Slam event, late last 
year but says he has never played in an indoor tournament before. 
</P>
<P>
"The indoor game is so much faster," he said. "I don't feel too good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega added that he is feeling some pressure over being ranked second in the 
nation: "You're not supposed to lose to anyone behind you in the rankings, and 
there's only one guy ahead of me."

Bishop Montgomery 56, Servite 54 -- Senior guard Darrell Daniel, shaking off 
the flu, scored seven of his game-high 17 points in the fourth quarter to help 
the Knights rally for an Angelus League victory at home and strengthen their 
hold on second place. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery trailed by its largest deficit, 46-40, a minute into the 
fourth quarter before reeling off eight unanswered points, capped by a Daniel 
three-pointer, to go ahead with 4:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Servite regained the lead, 52-50, with 3:43 left on a basket by guard Jamie 
Rosenkranz, but the Friars went cold from the floor in the waning minutes and 
didn't score again until forward Steve Marusich beat the buzzer with a follow 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys sucked it up down the stretch," Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell 
said. "We got a lot more intense on defense. We caused some turnovers, and that 
got us back in it." 
</P>
<P>
While Servite was scoreless for most of the last four minutes, the Knights 
opened a lead by making six of 10 free-throw attempts. Daniel's foul shot with 
eight seconds left made it 56-52 and iced the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gamer," Mitchell said of his leading scorer. "He didn't practice (this 
week) because he was sick. I didn't think he would play this well." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Pete Tolliver added 12 points for Bishop Montgomery and, along with 
forward Joe Magyar, did a good job of battling the taller Friars on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Servite was led by 6-4 Adam Anderson with 15 points and 6-7 Marusich with 14. 
Rosenkranz added 11 but scored only two in the second half against tenacious 
pressure by guard Kirk Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery (13-5 overall) improved to 4-2 in league play, good for 
second place behind unbeaten Mater Dei. The Knights visit Mater Dei at 7:30 
Friday night. ROB FERNAS

WEST COACH WRESTLES WITH SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
KENT WYATT HAS GUIDED TEAMS SUCCESSFULLY FOR 20 YEARS WHILE OTHER SOUTH BAY 
SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE FALLEN ON LEAN TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The more things change in South Bay wrestling programs, the more things remain 
the same with the West Torrance High program. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with declining enrollment and demographic changes, budget cuts and 
smaller wrestlers, West Coach Kent Wyatt has survived and even prospered when, 
all around, others in the area have fallen on lean times. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt's program has been at or near the top since he began coaching at West 20 
years ago. And after this year's success, it looks as if he might be starting 
another winning decade. 
</P>
<P>
West is ranked No. 1 in the CIF Southern Section 3-A Division coaches poll, is 
unbeaten in the Ocean League and has a 15-1 dual-meet record. Wyatt won his 
200th career dual meet last week against North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"This started out to be a rebuilding year," he said, "but it has turned out to 
be a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The Changes 
</P>
<P>
At West, there has been a dramatic shift away from a predominantly white 
enrollment to about 48% Asian. The Asian wrestlers are smaller, which helps 
fill the lighter weight divisions but makes it hard to fill the heavier 
divisions, especially when there are fewer kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to get the Asian kids out for athletics," Wyatt said, "because 
they are so academically oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment has dropped from 3,000 students in the late '60s to 1,560 this year. 
Since the early 1980s, three South Bay high schools (Aviation, Lennox and 
Lawndale) have closed. 
</P>
<P>
When Wyatt came to West in 1971, there were 11 physical education teachers. Now 
there are three. Wyatt once received $1,800 a year from the district for his 
wrestling budget. Now he gets $450. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to tough times. 
</P>
<P>
"The fight for dollars is tough. And you don't get the kind of support in some 
schools that you used to see," said Jack Fernandez, who coached 27 years at 
Mira Costa High before retiring in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Success 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt remains unchanged in his commitment to achieving excellence with a 
wrestling team despite being the only full-time, on-campus wrestling coach. 
</P>
<P>
At 43, he is best described as a self-effacing beach lover with thin, 
sun-bleached hair -- the result of regular surfing. He teaches four physical 
education classes, coaches at West three hours a day, is an assistant wrestling 
coach at El Camino College and still finds time during the week to run between 
30 and 50 miles in addition to surfing. 
</P>
<P>
His wrestling teams haven't been shortchanged, though. They have been 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, except for two, Wyatt has had a wrestler place in the Southern 
Section Masters Meet, from which the top six finishers qualify for the state 
meet. But he has never had a state champion. 
</P>
<P>
"If, as a coach, the state meet was my only goal, I'd be a real frustrated 
coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coach 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to look much further than Wyatt when looking for reasons to 
explain success at West. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a good coach, you'll have a good program," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt was an outstanding wrestler at Mira Costa for Fernandez. He was a 
145-pound Southern Section champion as a senior in 1964 and was also the 
school's Outstanding Athlete that year. He was a two-time junior college state 
champion in 1965 and 1966 at El Camino and won the NCAA Division II title in 
his senior year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"He's certainly one of our stars from Mira Costa," Fernandez said. "One of our 
brightest. And you won't find anyone more competitive than Kent." 
</P>
<P>
That keeps his teams competitive, too. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt says his fighting spirit was what motivated him to bring back to life a 
sagging wrestling program when it hit a lull in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It basically boils down to I hate losing," he said. "I want my teams to win. 
It's just not in my makeup to run through the motions and have a mediocre 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The power in the 1960s and 1970s (in high school wrestling) was in the South 
Bay," Wyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the top five teams in the Masters Meet were from the old Bay League: 
West, Mira Costa, North Torrance, Torrance and Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"But it got to the point where we weren't competing at the CIF level," Wyatt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution was getting Asian athletes involved. Wyatt says when he 
first came to West, he had no Asians on the team. This year there are six on 
the varsity. The only senior on the team, Steve Lee, moved to Southern 
California five years ago from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the bigger kids we used to have in the '60s and '70s," Wyatt 
said. "It was hard when I first came here to fill the light weights. I had to 
wrestle sophomores at 98 pounds. Now it is a senior." 
</P>
<P>
It may be different shapes and sizes, but somehow Wyatt coaxes winners out of 
whatever athletes he can get to snap on headgear and get down in a four-point 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes you feel like you can beat anybody in (all the) CIF," said Lee, who 
took third at the 3-A Division finals last year and has compiled a 32-5 record 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt also uses guys like junior heavyweight Josh Gormley, who transferred in 
this year, and junior Scott Herman, whom Wyatt has known since Herman was in 
the second grade. Herman, 23-4 this season, was the league champion last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And Wyatt has gotten sterling performances from unlikely sources. Last weekend 
in a tournament at Morro Bay, junior Demian Botero made it to the finals, and 
junior Dan Chaney has placed in every tournament this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very close to his kids," Fernandez said of Wyatt. "The drive comes from 
a very supportive family. He still keeps his surfboard at his dad's garage down 
on 17th Street in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases, to be a good wrestler it takes cooperation from the whole 
family. It takes so much dedication and discipline you just can't do it on your 
own." 
</P>
<P>
To Wyatt, his wrestlers are like family. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wrestle with them (in practice) and I'm closer than any (other) coach 
because of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Legacy 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no state champion, West has had its share of impressive 
teams and individuals through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt's first group of seniors in 1974 won the first, and only, CIF title of 
Wyatt's coaching era. That team had four individual finalists and three were 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
West went undefeated from the second match in 1973 until midway through the 
1977 season, including a second-place finish in CIF and third in state in 1976, 
when two wrestlers were runners-up and another was third. 
</P>
<P>
For Wyatt, 1976 was a big year -- he was married. He has two daughters and two 
stepdaughters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, West went undefeated again in duel meets and was third in the CIF 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
The following years until 1986 were difficult, and Wyatt thought about quitting 
because he was burned out. 
</P>
<P>
One of the only highlights Wyatt remembers from those years was in 1981 when 
West's Greg Thornton took second in state. Thornton had broken his wrist five 
weeks before the meet. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1986, Wyatt caught a second wind. The team tooks third in the 3-A 
Division and went undefeated in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Warriors repeated as league champs, went undefeated and took 
fourth in the 3-A Division finals. Senior Mike Ramirez successfully defended 
his CIF title. 
</P>
<P>
The team has exceeded Wyatt's expectations this year. But people at West have 
become used to that.

PASADENA TOPPLES EL CAMINO, 110-102, IN DOUBLE OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Brown made a pair of free throws with 33 seconds remaining to secure 
Pasadena's 110-102 South Coast Conference victory over El Camino Wednesday 
night in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors fell to 2-4 in the SCC and 17-8 overall while Pasadena, the 
league's last-place team, improved to 2-3 and 12-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino held a small lead through most of the first half. Back-to-back 
three-pointers by freshman Michael Houck gave the Warriors a four-point edge 
with 12:18 left for the break. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena led 28-27, with 5:52 left, after a pair of Ken Lawson free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors went scoreless for the next three minutes and the Lancers 
capitalized, taking a 38-31 lead after a three-pointer by forward Chris Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's Cornelius Edwards sank a pair of free throws, with 54 seconds 
remaining, to give the Lancers a 40-33 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
A one-handed jam by El Camino guard Frank Beatty shaved Pasadena's lead to one 
with 13:05 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later the Warriors took the lead, 67-66, after a three-pointer by 
Darius Dubose. The freshman guard followed the shot with a 10-foot jumper that 
gave El Camino a three-point edge with 6:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
A five-point Beatty run, which included a lay in and a three-pointer, gave El 
Camino a 77-72 lead with 3:27 remaining. But Pasadena's Lawson sank a pair of 
free throws to tie the game at 77-77 with 2:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
A three-pointer by Keith Brown gave the Warriors an 81-79 edge with 23 seconds 
left, but Pasadena's Brown made a pair of free throws to tie the score 81-81 
with six seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore made the three-point shot that tied the score 93-93 at the end of 
the first overtime.

LOYOLA CHALLENGES STRONG ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount baseball team, off to a 2-1 start, will travel to Tucson 
for a three-game series with the University of Arizona starting with a 2:30 
p.m. game today. The teams will play at 2:30 Friday and 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, coming off a 13-6 victory over UC Irvine on Tuesday, are led, as 
expected, by All-American catcher Miah Bradbury, who had seven hits in his 
first 11 at-bats, including three doubles and a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Also off to a fast start are freshman shortstop Chris Gomez, hitting a 
team-high .667, and outfielder Rick Mediavilla, a junior-college transfer 
hitting .455 and leading the Lions in steals and runs scored. Junior Chris 
Spears has picked up both Loyola victories in relief. Arizona is rated 22nd and 
24th nationally in preseason polls. ALAN DROOZ

TWINS GIVE LEAGUE A LOOK ALL ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kim and Lori Martin and Amy and Julie Uhrman not only are two sets of sisters 
who play on the same basketball teams, they are identical twins who compete in 
the same league. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins are the starting guards at Faith Baptist, and the Uhrmans are the 
starting guards at Brentwood. When those teams pair off in Delphic League 
plays, statisticians run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters more confusing, Faith Baptist starts Erica Martin, the younger 
sister of the twins, at forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell the twins apart now, but sometimes I still make a mistake," Faith 
Baptist Coach Sally Dexter said. "I'll go through all three names before I get 
it right. Last year it was easier because they wore their hair differently, but 
this year, they both wear it back in a braid. It can be really confusing." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Martin is Faith Baptist's leading scorer, averaging 17 points. She also is 
averaging 5.6 rebounds and 3.9 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting surge: Apparently, it takes Chaminade's Colin Havert a while to 
recover from the crushing blows sustained during football season. Havert, an 
All-San Fernando Valley League tailback, also plays point guard for the Eagles 
and has made an impact recently after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Havert scored 28 points in a 72-64 victory over La Salle last week, including 
three three-point baskets in the final four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing I can count on," Coach Mike Lynn said. "When Colin's on the 
court, he's going to create something." 
</P>
<P>
Long time coming: Palmdale does not attempt many three-point shots. In fact, 
Coach Gary Phelps, who doesn't even include the statistic in his weekly totals, 
can count the number of his team's long-distance shots on, well, two hands with 
two borrowed fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Forward John Johnson's three-point shot in Friday's 63-57 Golden League victory 
over Quartz Hill was only the Falcons' 12th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Quartz Hill Coach Don Moore on Palmdale's success at holding forward 
Gabe Higa to 14 points -- including a solitary field goal: "They two-timed . . 
. him underneath the basket," Moore said. "They had two pretty big kids. That's 
why he had so many free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Higa was 12 of 14 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Add Quotebook: North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller, assessing his team, ranked 
fourth in the Valley, after its first 20 games: "Well, we're 18 and Grant." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, of course, have been tripped just twice this season: both times by 
the Lancers.

CIF ROUNDUP

<P>
St. Bernard 62, Verbum Dei 61 -- Sophomore forward Chris Keldorf, taking an 
inbounds pass from Terry Sullivan on the right wing, hit a three-point shot at 
the buzzer to lift the Vikings to a Camino Real League victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
Center Wyking Jones scored 19 points and guard Martin Smith added 15 for St. 
Bernard, which snapped a three-game losing streak and improved to 10-10 overall 
and 5-5 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Verbum Dei fell to 7-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony 92, Serra 82 -- Despite a game-high 37 points for guard Kenny 
Davis, the Cavaliers suffered an Camino Real League loss at St. Anthony. Serra 
dropped to 9-9 overall and 5-5 in the league. St. Anthony (12-4, 8-2) got 25 
points from center Dan Morgan and 21 from guard Damaine Powell.

DIGEST: CSUN AND CLU, GOING SEPARATE WAYS IN FOOTBALL, WILL NOT MEET IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The football rivalry between Cal State Northridge and Cal Lutheran, which dates 
to 1972, might be over. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN and CLU tentatively were scheduled to play in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 10, 
but the game has been canceled. Cal Lutheran will be playing its second season 
without adding scholarship players during its transition from Division II to 
the Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
Northridge, which holds a 10-3 series lead, is expected to be one of the top 
teams in the Division II Western Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has replaced Cal Lutheran with Cal State Long Beach. The Matadors 
will close out the regular season on Nov. 10 against the 49ers at Veterans 
Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN will open the season with nonconference games at Northern Arizona on Sept. 
1, at home against Eastern New Mexico on Sept. 8, at Central (Okla.) State on 
Sept. 22 and at home against UC Davis on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Portland State, three-time defending WFC champion, will be CSUN's first 
conference opponent on Oct. 6. The Matadors will play at Southern Utah State on 
Oct. 13, at home against Cal State Sacramento on Oct. 20, at Santa Clara on 
Oct. 27 and at home against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Provenzano of Glendale College got an early start on the track season, 
qualifying for The Times/Eagle Indoor Meet Feb. 16 at the Forum by placing 
second in the 800 meters in the qualifying meet Saturday at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Provenzano's time of 1 minute 53.55 seconds was a little more than a second off 
his personal best (1:52.54) run last May while at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising he's running that fast so early in the year," Glendale Coach 
Ed Lopez said. "He's been training hard and he's in the best shape of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
However, by participating in The Times meet, Provenzano will miss Glendale's 
opener against West L. A. and Santa Barbara, which is also scheduled for Feb. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Erick McBride, a freshman from Cal State Northridge, also qualified for the 
meet (1:55.08) by placing fourth in the same race, but he was well off his time 
of 1:52.6, which he ran at Northridge's all-comers meet in December.

FIVE TO WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL? NBA? WELL, LET THEM TRY HIGH SCHOOL FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighth-graders who make the grade: They are out there in droves, playing 
basketball in everything from common recreation centers to unique parochial 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But who are the best, and what can San Diegans expect from them in the future? 
Perhaps more important, what is too much to ask of them? 
</P>
<P>
"Every individual is different," said Bill Walton, a fine eighth-grader in his 
own right when he was attending Blessed Sacrament Elementary School. "Some are 
more mature at an earlier age. I have one myself. He's good, and he has a 
chance to go and become better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Walton, of course, took his game much further, to UCLA and the National 
Basketball Assn. Oldest son Adam, an eighth-grader at Earl Warren Junior High 
in Solana Beach, is recovering from a broken left foot, oddly enough (Bill had 
chronic foot problems in the NBA) and hasn't played since Christmas. Adam is 
taking statistics and assisting Coach Bill Vice. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of it depends on attitude, work ethic and injuries," Bill Walton said, 
"and basketball is the ultimate test." 
</P>
<P>
Erik Meek, a 6-10 junior center at San Pasqual, may be the most recruited 
player since Walton. But it isn't often that a player of such talent surfaces 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a player like Meek once but every five years," said Mt. Carmel Coach 
John Marincovich. "I don't like to push my eighth-graders too much. They're too 
young. I like them to progress at their own rate." 
</P>
<P>
But a search of the county produces at least five players who may take their 
high schools by storm as early as next year: 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Carey 
</P>
<P>
Black Mountain Middle School 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Penasquitos 
</P>
<P>
Maria Carey didn't mince words as she quickly scrawled a message to her son, 
who was slowing falling apart before her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Calm down and be cool out there," Mom wrote during a game last year. She sent 
one of Marlin's opponents -- who also happened to be his best friend -- to 
deliver the note at courtside. 
</P>
<P>
Said Maria: "He was getting upset, and normally he doesn't. I knew if he didn't 
calm down, he would have gotten kicked out." 
</P>
<P>
Carey settled down, and his Poway Youth Basketball Assn. team went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the note helped," said Carey, a 5-foot-9 guard for his junior high and 
PYBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Martin, his PYBA coach last year, Carey has potential galore 
but can also be very emotional. 
</P>
<P>
"He's exciting to watch, and he's an exceptional ballplayer," Martin said, "but 
he'd lose it once in a while. He's so young, though, and he'll mature." 
</P>
<P>
Carey has led his PYBA team to a 4-1 record, averaging 17 points and seven 
rebounds. Last year, more than 1,000 of his peers voted him the PYBA's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
But he is already mature enough to know that so much can get in the way of his 
dream of playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let it get to my head," said Carey. "I'm not a (Michael) Jordan or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Carey, who will attend Mt. Carmel High, also has standout football skills. He 
scored 33 touchdowns and gained more than 1,500 yards last season as a running 
back on Rancho Penasquitos' Pop Warner Midget team. But basketball is his first 
love. 
</P>
<P>
"I like football and everything," he said, "but I'm really going after 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flynn, another former coach, said Carey is "a very gifted player. He can 
play any position, he has good leaping ability and good offensive skills." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said Carey is a smooth operator but also a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
"He has extraordinary quickness," Flynn said. "He just glides. He has a very 
fast first step, and you have to give him room because he can blow by people in 
a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Martin recalled a game where Carey dribbled through all five opponents and 
flipped the ball for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"He's exciting to watch," Martin said. "His skills are so good. You can never 
count him out for his ability. He stands out so much." 
</P>
<P>
Truc Huynh 
</P>
<P>
Grant Middle School, Escondido 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnamese, above the giggles from friends and two younger sisters, Huynh 
asks her oldest brother, Quoc, what team he plays for at Escondido High. 
</P>
<P>
"Freshman," he replies in English. 
</P>
<P>
The general opinion is that Truc could easily take his place next year. She is 
a regular for the eighth-grade boys at Grant, who are 15-1. Coach Steve 
Bruecker said Dave Turner, Quoc's coach, has joked about her playing for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tongue-in-cheek comment," Bruecker said. "He said she could make his 
team, but he knows the girls really need her." 
</P>
<P>
Huynh's presence on a girls' team will be a unique experience. Other than her 
physical-education classes at Grant, she has never played with or against 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid of hurting them," said Huynh, a 5-5 guard with a 3.75 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The only sport Huynh played before she moved from Vietnam in 1986 was soccer. 
After she and Quoc began watching the Lakers, she developed a thirst for 
basketball. A year later, she played her first organized game for Grant's 
seventh-grade boys. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 years of junior high coaching, Bruecker had never seen a girl on a boys' 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to try out just like anyone else," he said. "No one complained because 
she's equal or above half the team. She's completely accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Bruecker said that when players see her, "they realize they're going against a 
player with exceptional skills, and they forget she's a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Huynh has started three games for Grant but is usually the first player off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"She comes in as an opportunity to rest the other guard," Bruecker said. "I'm 
confident with her ability to get into the flow of the game off the bench. The 
tempo doesn't change when she's brought in." 
</P>
<P>
Bruecker says Huynh, 14 and left-handed, is an excellent ball-handler and 
outside shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"She comes into the game," Bruecker said, "and if she's left open at 18-23 
feet, she'll get it. She drives real well to the basket, and if she's open, she 
gets a layup." 
</P>
<P>
Bruecker said Huynh plays with energy and enthusiasm and contributes on and off 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Her attitude and love of the game makes her stand out," he said. "Even when 
she isn't in the game, she still is. Basketball's her joy." 
</P>
<P>
Tavie Mason 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Middle School, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
Mason once showed up at the Encanto Recreation Center with just 10 minutes of 
practice remaining for Hoover's freshman team. But Ralph Brice, his coach, 
wasn't mad. He was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't get a ride and instead of just staying home, he came anyway, with 
10 minutes to spare," said Brice, who has three eighth-graders on his team. 
"That showed me he's willing to do anything just to be there. He (acts like a 
team's) 12th man, willing to come and improve. He has the best attitude on the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Mason, 13 and a 5-8 guard, has a few rough edges, but Brice said he is "by far 
the most talented player at this level. There's fire in his eye. Every game he 
gives me 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Brice said Jim Thompson, Madison's varsity coach, told him Mason had the talent 
to start for him right now. Hoover Coach Hal Mitrovich is equally taken. 
</P>
<P>
"He would probably start for us as a freshman," Mitrovich said. 
</P>
<P>
In a game against St. Augustine last week, Hoover scored 58 points; Mason had 
51. Rough Edge No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him to distribute the ball a little more," Brice said, "get him to be 
more of a team player." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Hoover scored 61 points, and Mason limited his total to 38. He 
is averaging 35 points and close to 14 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's learning to play more with the team and not carry the load," Brice said. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said one of the qualities that separates Mason from thousands of other 
talented junior high players is maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays like he's five years older," Brice said. "Other players don't have 
the confidence he has. He just has the knack to go to the hoop, and he has it 
right now. He's not afraid to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
With all Mason's shooting and passing abilities, Brice said, Rough Edge No. 2 
is defense. 
</P>
<P>
"His defense is still weak," he said, "but he's doing everything: rebounding, 
shooting, passing. That will come." 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps take him to higher levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now he's thinking about college," Brice said. "His main thing is to 
compete in college. His parents are very supportive. They'll guide him in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Montalvo 
</P>
<P>
Earl Warren Junior High 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach 
</P>
<P>
If he can avoid the path taken by two older brothers -- and there is a coach 
and friend who is determined that he will -- Montalvo could become one of the 
county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers attended Torrey Pines for two years and played junior varsity 
basketball. By the end of their sophomore years, both had left the program. Tim 
Ovies, who has helped coach Montalvo since the summer of 1988, is hoping that 
trend ends. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a terrific kid," Ovies said. "We're just trying to stop that process." 
</P>
<P>
His brothers' example and presence has also helped him. Because they played 
with him daily through the years, Eddie had opportunities many boys his age 
lack. 
</P>
<P>
"That helped me a lot," Montalvo said, "just playing with bigger players." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ovies: "One of the reasons he's so good is he's always played against 
older brothers. After (one) finished his sophomore year, Eddie used to beat him 
consistently in one-on-one situations. Any kid who can beat someone with a 
two-year high school background, that's something." 
</P>
<P>
Although Montalvo, who is 5-10, has a relatively modest career high of 27 
points and averages just 16.7 a game, Coach Bill Vice said that is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an unspoken rule on the team," Vice said. "If we are up by 20, the 
other kids get to play." 
</P>
<P>
Vice said Montalvo, 14, plays close to three quarters a game and has led his 
team to a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Ovies said Montalvo's biggest obstacle is his self-doubt, an area they are 
constantly trying to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Just his presence offers leadership," Ovies said, "but he's not a leader yet. 
He'll never be a high school point guard unless he learns to vocalize. He likes 
to let his play say it all, but unless he vocalizes it, it won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Montalvo may attend Torrey Pines or University City, but he already has his 
sights set on a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go to UCLA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ovies: "I keep telling him that he may never hit the NBA, but at least he 
can get an education and change things for his mom and his family. If he makes 
all the right choices, he knows it will get him a scholarship and into 
college." 
</P>
<P>
Shondel Robinson 
</P>
<P>
Gompers Secondary, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
Here's to you, Miss Robinson. According to Michael Skibbe, your Encanto 
Recreation Center coach, only one thing separates you from a future college 
scholarship: incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
"If she doesn't get a Division I scholarship, someone screwed up," Skibbe said. 
</P>
<P>
Skibbe isn't the only one who seems so sure of Robinson's potential. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Robinson said her 13-year-old daughter received at least 10 Christmas 
cards from college coaches who saw her in a tournament last summer in Florida, 
when she was playing on the Police Athletic League's 13-under All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
"She has gotten a lot of encouragement," Celeste Robinson said. "And it's real 
encouraging to see our children make an impression in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is the only girl in a family with five boys -- all basketball players 
-- including Archie, 14, a freshman on Lincoln's varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
"She goes straight to the hole, just like a little Archie," Skibbe said. "With 
five brothers, she'd had the opportunity to play with the guys, and it's 
helped. She's the only player I have who doesn't play like a girl." 
</P>
<P>
But she gets plenty of practice with girls, from her own PAL team to Lincoln's 
varsity, with whom she practices and helps manage. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a lot better than I am," Shondel said. "But more to my level (than 
boys)." 
</P>
<P>
Said Skibbe: "I know Lincoln has already put its mark on her." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is becoming less and less of a one-woman show for Encanto -- she 
scored 18 points in a 41-19 first-game loss, then contributed 31 in the next 
game, a 49-38 victory -- but that's partially because she has made her 
teammates play up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
"She makes everyone around her better," Skibbe said. "She's such a positive 
influence, leading by example. She knows her God-given talents, and she takes 
it from there." 
</P>
<P>
One of Shondel's talents, Skibbe said, is an exceptional feel for the court, 
knowing where to go and what to do without having to stop and think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"She shoots, she follows, she goes back up," Skibbe said. "She knows the court. 
She knows where the ball is. She always has her head up, looking." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is a 4-11 guard, averaging 30 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for 
Encanto, which is 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"With Shondel, you're always going to be competitive," Skibbe said. "It doesn't 
take teams long to figure out she's the one to stop."

TORREY PINES DROPS RBV BACK INTO PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrey Pines held a one-point advantage going into the final quarter, then 
proceeded to outscore Rancho Buena Vista, 21-16, for a crucial, 64-58 Palomar 
League victory. 
</P>
<P>
RBV (9-9, 5-4), which had been hanging surprisingly close in the standings, 
fell three games behind league-leading Mt. Carmel and two behind Torrey Pines 
(20-2, 8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' Kyle Armstrong led all scorers with 18. Carter Brown helped put 
RBV away late in the game with some crucial one-and-ones. He was five of seven 
from the line and finished with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
RBV's Bond Schoefel entered the game in the second quarter and scored 10 of his 
16 points before halftime. Brad Grubaugh also scored 16 for the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Parker, who entered the game with a 23.7-point average, was held to just 
12. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel 59, Fallbrook 54 -- Mt. Carmel (16-3, 9-0) maintained an eight-point 
lead through much of the game, but things tightened up with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's Darnell Lee made a field goal, and Mt. Carmel's Shane Knight was 
called for a technical foul. Chris Miller made both free throws, then got the 
ball back on the inbounds and hit a three-pointer to cut Fallbrook's deficit to 
55-54. 
</P>
<P>
But Mt. Carmel's Ryan Wootton made a quick layup, Fallbrook (14-7, 5-4) missed 
its next shot, and the Sundevils then scored again to put it away. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 98, Orange Glen 46 -- Poway (13-5, 4-5) had four in double figures: Greg 
Sorrell (19), Frank Garrett (15), Kirk Hipple (14) and Zeke Awbrey (13). 
</P>
<P>
Avocado League 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 90, Ramona 51 -- Ramona (12-5, 4-4) never recovered from a two-point 
first quarter. Jeff Reeves led El Camino (14-5, 7-0) with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 49, Escondido 30 -- Oceanside (10-10, 4-4) got off to a bad start, 
scoring only eight points in the first quarter, but Escondido (5-10, 3-5) had 
the bad finish: just 14 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 87, San Marcos 48 -- Erik Meek led San Pasqual (13-5, 6-1) with 33 
points in only three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Girls 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague

ST. AUGUSTINE FORFEITS 12 FOR USE OF INELIGIBLE PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Augustine High School boys' basketball team must forfeit 12 games, 
including two in the City Harbor League, for using an ineligible player, school 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine had been tied for first in the league with Coronado and Christian 
(3-1), but the forfeits -- including league losses to Coronado and Marian 
Catholic -- leave the Saints at 2-19 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is first alone at 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an oversight that has since been cleared up," said Marty Martin, St. 
Augustine athletic director. "The public-to-private transfer waiver form was 
never signed by the player." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the oversight was discovered after an athlete from another sport 
had a routine interview with Principal John Sanders. It was discovered that the 
athlete hadn't signed the waiver form, leading Sanders to ask Martin about the 
basketball player. When the mistake was discovered, St. Augustine immediately 
notified the San Diego Section office, and the form was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The player missed St. Augustine's 79-76 victory over Clairemont but was back 
for the Saints' 92-88 overtime victory over University City Friday. LAURA

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD WOMEN GET COACH FROM AZTEC VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Hegerle, who for the past four years has been an assistant volleyball 
coach at San Diego State, will take over the University of San Diego women's 
program, the school announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hegerle will replace John Martin, who had been the only coach in the 15-year 
history of the USD women's program. 
</P>
<P>
He will now work as USD's director of recreation and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
While at SDSU, Hegerle and Coach Rudy Suwara guided the Aztecs to three NCAA 
Western Regionals in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hegerle graduated from SDSU in 1984. In her four years of varsity volleyball 
there, the Aztecs had a 150-41 record. She was a member of the U.S. Volleyball 
Assn. national championship team last year. 
</P>

BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State announced that Tori Baker, a 5-foot-9 sophomore guard, will 
transfer from the University of Oregon. Baker played in just two games this 
season for Oregon, averaging three points and one rebound. Last season, she 
started 18 of 30 games and averaged 9.3 points a game after red-shirting her 
freshman year while recovering from an ankle injury. She will be eligible to 
play at SDSU after the 1990 fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Slam-N-Jam dunk contest will be held March 23 at Mt. Carmel High 
School. Interested high school basketball players wishing to compete should 
talk to their coaches or call Mt. Carmel at 484-1180.

S.D. FARMERS BAZAAR GETS BACK TO BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Farmers Bazaar, closed last May after a devastating fire, will resume full 
operation at a new downtown San Diego location next month. 
</P>
<P>
As did the former market, the new Farmers Bazaar will aspire to offer shoppers 
a cornucopia of fresh produce, meat and fish. Restaurants and jewelry shops are 
also planned. The new warehouse at K Street and 7th Avenue is next to the 
original Farmers Bazaar location, now a parking lot for the new market. 
</P>
<P>
The market has operated at limited capacity since June and now offers only 
produce and flowers. By mid-March, however, 18 vendors will occupy the 
20,000-square-foot market. 
</P>
<P>
"By the middle of February we should have a jewelry store," said George May, 
the supervisor of the operation. "By the first of March, we should have the 
restaurants in, and we should be going full force by the middle of March." 
</P>
<P>
Even after the other tenants have moved in, the main attraction will remain the 
produce, May said. 
</P>
<P>
From rapini, a green spice used in Italian sauces, to Asian pears, whose taste 
and texture are similar to a cross between an apple and a pear, to four 
different kinds of squash, the La Cresta Market at the bazaar offers a large 
selection of produce at prices that customers believe are significantly lower 
than those charged by supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"You get good buys, and they're awfully good and fresh," said Wynne Flack, a 
part-time San Diego resident from Canada. "You've got such a good choice here, 
better than the markets. . . . We've got nothing like this in Canada." 
</P>
<P>
The roll-up doors, cement floor and large, institutional lamps hanging from the 
30-foot ceiling reflect the bazaar's warehouse origins. But they do not seem to 
deter shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"You never see a mouse here," said a woman who has been shopping at the market 
for five years, a vocal advocate of the market who declined to give her name. 
"It's a lot bigger than before, more room to move around in. It's better. The 
fire helped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Moreno, manager of the 10,000-square-foot produce stall, said sales are 
just keeping up with expenses. At $6,000 a month rent, costs are no different 
than what Moreno would have to pay if he were to operate his own store, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he is optimistic that extra vendors will boost business. "It will get a lot 
busier soon, because the restaurants will be here, fish and meat market and 
some shops, so we expect to do about twice the sales we are doing now," Moreno 
said. About 2,000 customers a day troop through the market. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of doing business, such as rent and salaries, have gone up 
significantly since the fire at the original location. But, at the same time, 
business has increased about 50%, Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno said connections with farmers in all parts of the country and a large 
sales volume make lower prices possible. On an average day, he sells more than 
4,000 pounds of bananas, 40 boxes of apples and 80 boxes of lettuce 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the bazaar is filling in fast, May said, with space renting for 
$2.50 a square foot per month, twice the rent charged at the old location. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican and Italian restaurants have both signed leases that begin in March, 
and May hopes to find a Chinese restaurant. The 600-square-foot areas available 
for the restaurants will rent out at $1,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
And the effects of the restaurants should spill over to the other enterprises, 
May said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting more people buying produce than we had before, but we used to 
have a terrific lunch crowd," May said. "We expect that crowd to return, and 
that's expected to increase sales all around." 
</P>
<P>
The bazaar, owned by San Diego businessman and developer Tom Hom, is in its 
15th year of operation. The downtown market attracts people from all over the 
county -- as far away as Oceanside and Escondido, May said.

A JUROR'S TRIALS; 
</P>
<P>
MARK BASSETT THOUGHT JURY DUTY MIGHT BE A LARK. AFTER THE MCMARTIN TRIAL, HE 
KNEW BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Bassett was actually rather pleased when he received a summons to jury 
duty, his first ever, back in March, 1987. Things had been "kind of hectic" at 
work and, he says, "I kind of looked at it as a vacation," a couple of weeks 
sitting in the jury room, maybe a few days on a case. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow employees at Symult Systems, a scientific computer company in Monrovia, 
suggested the possibility of his being chosen as a juror for the 
much-publicized McMartin Pre-school child molestation case, which promised to 
be drawn out. "Wouldn't it be funny if I got on . . . " Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, nine weeks after he reported for jury duty, and having to his surprise 
survived a rigorous selection process during which many (500) were called but 
few were chosen, Bassett, a research scientist, found himself seated as an 
alternate McMartin juror. 
</P>
<P>
He was the final alternate to be picked, one of six ready to replace any of the 
12 jurors should it become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Little did he know that he had just become a player in what would be the 
longest and most expensive criminal trial in history. By the time it ended, it 
would have cost the taxpayers close to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
What was the cost to one juror, Mark Bassett? 
</P>
<P>
For starters, he lost his job when the company for which he had worked for six 
years went bankrupt; unlike the other employees, Bassett was not free to look 
for another. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, the trial was "very draining. You're dealing with extremely 
emotional issues. And there's no one in the whole world you can talk to and 
say, 'This is rough,' and why." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers in vivid detail the "riveting" testimony of the McMartin children, 
the anatomically graphic exhibits, the sobs from their parents as the "not 
guilty" verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a whole lot of issues I've had to deal with (that) the average 
person would not have to deal with," he says. "This case took the jury through 
all the aspects of human experience." 
</P>
<P>
He says he became really aware for the first time of "the trauma child abuse 
has on families. If I were to become a parent someday, that would be something 
that would be a lot more on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Although, on reflection, he says, "I really would rather have not been on" the 
jury, he views the process as a positive experience, one that gave him added 
self-confidence, taught him "a bit about trying to be tactful," about the 
subtle art of negotiation, about learning to "think critically." 
</P>
<P>
They were a diverse lot, these jurors. They included a supermarket checker, a 
Pacific Bell employee, a biomedical technician, a meat packer, an engineer, a 
mechanic, a federal government employee and a stock clerk. Few among them, 
Bassett acknowledges, were people who otherwise might have touched his life. 
Like them, he had passed intense scrutiny by prosecution and defense attorneys 
and by Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders, who presided at the trial -- 
"Were you ever molested as a child? Have you ever molested anyone? What do you 
read?" 
</P>
<P>
What did he know about the case, they had asked Bassett. The truth, he says, is 
that all he knew was "that it was kind of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Did he have close friends or relatives, they wanted to know, who worked with 
abused children? He acknowledges, "I did kind of make a list of people I knew 
in child care, which I assumed would get me off." And, yes, there was a good 
friend in Memphis, a psychologist who works with abused children; at the time 
Bassett was making plans to attend his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
That probably clinched it, he remembers thinking to himself -- he wouldn't be 
able to buy his way onto this jury. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he says, "I always heard that lawyers tend not to like intelligent 
people" on juries. And here he was, with an undergraduate degree from Princeton 
and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from CalTech. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders had told prospective jurors that the trial was apt to last close to a 
year, and, Bassett says, "I saw it as a great imposition." Nevertheless, he 
answered the questions honestly -- "I didn't think they'd believe I didn't 
understand the concept of reasonable doubt," for example, he says. Some other 
would-be jurors stated outright they didn't want to serve; despite that, some 
were picked. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett smiles and says, "I guess the attorneys' attitude was that it's a dirty 
job, but someone has to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He was less than overjoyed, as was his employer, who would continue to pay his 
salary, when told he could be off the job a year. Still, he says, the personnel 
people were "understanding and very supportive" of him but "kind of mad at the 
court system." 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin trial got under way on July 13, 1987. Two years and six months 
later -- on Jan. 18, 1990 -- their job done, the jurors would leave the 
courtroom to resume normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of one life, many things happen in 2 1/2 years. Among the 12 
original jurors and six alternates, there were illnesses, personal tragedies 
and moments of joy. 
</P>
<P>
Juror John Breese lost his wife and remarried. Juror Brenda Williams was 
married. There was a recess after the death of one juror's father. One juror 
had back surgery, another suffered a stroke, another had a gallbladder 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
One juror was dismissed for failing to be attentive. "He was actually asleep in 
the jury box," Bassett says. "The other jurors had to keep waking him up." 
</P>
<P>
Before the trial ended, half of the original 12 jurors had been replaced by 
Bassett and the other alternates. At one point, the judge told the media that 
the situation for jurors was nearing "desperate straits." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, Bassett, who two months earlier had replaced a regular juror 
excused because of job problems, learned that his company was bankrupt and had 
decided to "fold it up." He might have to quit the jury and find a job. 
</P>
<P>
If his soon-to-be-unemployed status was alarming news to him, it was equally so 
to Pounders, because there were no alternates left and the judge faced the 
possibility of a $15-million mistrial. So, he arranged for Bassett to go on the 
county payroll as of July 1. 
</P>
<P>
When court was in session, juror Bassett was in court. When court was not in 
session, he was a senior computer program analyst for the county, earning 
$22.72 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was very sporadic," he says. Ordinarily, he would have provided 
computer trouble-shooting to judges, among others. But, he says, "as a juror, I 
couldn't have any contact with judges." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't been on the county job since October, he says, though the county has 
continued to carry him. But as of the end of February, he will no longer be a 
county employee. Wednesday, as District Attorney Ira Reiner announced that he 
would re-try Buckey, Bassett was on his way to San Diego for a job interview. 
</P>
<P>
At age 33, he wonders how much his high-tech field may have changed in the 2 
1/2 years that he wasn't on the front lines. Is it possible that he is no 
longer on the cutting edge? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what the impact has been," he says. "I should have been 
out there doing things, making contacts. In a technical field, what's modern 
now in two years will not be as modern." 
</P>
<P>
For Bassett, a bachelor, a soft-spoken, somewhat reticent man who, probably not 
by accident, chose a career field that is technology-oriented rather than 
people-oriented, a man who joined Toastmasters to learn to present himself 
"more assertively," being a McMartin juror was a lesson in human dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all the jurors wound up fast friends. There were, of course, cliques, 
little groups that lunched together, little groups that chatted together in the 
hall during breaks. Bassett often ate in Chinatown with Luis Chang, an engineer 
who was to be elected jury foreman. 
</P>
<P>
These were people who understood that, by chance, they were tapped to share an 
extraordinary experience. There were ties that bound. When juror Breese, a 
biomedical technician widowed during the trial, remarried in mid-November, 
Bassett was among the half-dozen juror-guests at the wedding. When juror John 
Duggan suffered a stroke, Bassett and some of the others visited him in the 
hospital. Duggan later dropped by the courthouse to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
In their 30 months in court, the jurors shared each others' joys and tragedies. 
Often, they laughed together. Sometimes, they acted silly. Some jurors 
developed a little ritual, Bassett recalls: On the 15th of each month, jurors' 
payday, they "would ask the clerk of the court where their checks were. And 
he'd say 'the check's in the mail.' " They each earned $10 per diem, plus 
mileage one way.) 
</P>
<P>
In early January, a few of them created a flap when, while passing time in the 
jury room, they helped a colleague come up with a catchy vanity license plate 
for a new car. On the blackboard, they wrote some suggestions: Jurypro. 
Hungjury. Hangman. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the judge nor the attorneys were amused. "The judge called us in one by 
one and asked us, 'Did you participate in this? What did the things written 
down mean to you?' " 
</P>
<P>
On the second anniversary of their service, the jurors all chipped in and feted 
themselves with a cake. "Kind of an obvious message to the judge," Bassett 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the inevitable happened to several jurors during the trial: 
Several of them received summonses to jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
"In a story of children against adults, if Hollywood were doing the script, the 
children would win," Bassett says. 
</P>
<P>
But the McMartin case wasn't Hollywood, where the action is quick and dramatic, 
the plot straightforward, every minute in the courtroom action-packed. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett has to smile as he compares the reality of the McMartin trial -- hours 
of boredom punctuated by moments of emotion -- with the movies' depictions of 
dramatic events. He observes that the escapades of an Indiana Jones may sell 
tickets but in real life you can't tell "an unbelievable story" and expect to 
be believed. 
</P>
<P>
And ultimately, Bassett and the other jurors -- at the end, eight men and four 
women -- found the prosecution's story too hard to believe. There simply was no 
evidence, he says, that "all this bizarre stuff" charged by the prosecution 
actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors sat through 60,000 pages of testimony, heard 124 witnesses and viewed 
more than 900 exhibits. At times, their heads reeled. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to copious note-taking as a way of venting his feelings. "You're not 
allowed to tell anyone how frustrated you are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Observing the action from his seat, fourth from the witness stand, second row 
of the jurors' box, Bassett became fascinated with the "theatrics" of the 
court, with the way seemingly unrelated and at times superfluous snippets of 
information fit together as parts of opposing attorneys' grand plans. 
</P>
<P>
But he's still puzzled about the turtle caper. A great fuss was made over some 
turtle shells dug up in a vacant lot next to the Manhattan Beach preschool and 
entered as exhibits, presumably to bolster the prosecution contention that 
there were satanic animal sacrifice rituals at the school. But in the final 
arguments, Bassett says, "They never mentioned them." 
</P>
<P>
He believes he set the record on this jury for most steno notebooks filled, 20, 
on both sides. They're packed in a cardboard box that he calls "my repository 
of McMartin memorabilia." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges, "I'm kind of a sentimental guy." 
</P>
<P>
The box also contains a bound copy of media coverage of the trial, a gift to 
each juror from Judge Pounders that Bassett is still reading through, and 
Polaroid snapshots of the bailiff and court clerk, both "pretty agreeable 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Bassett's memories include a glimpse of Pounders, during a recess, polishing 
the attorneys' lectern. They also include his continual fear that during a long 
session he would have to excuse himself to use the bathroom. "It would have 
been so embarrassing if you had to raise your hand in front of all those 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The trial ground on. 
</P>
<P>
As jurors waited for sessions to begin (often late), and during court delays, 
they whiled away hours in the jury room. Three were dedicated crossword puzzle 
buffs. The first few days someone brought in a Uno deck; everyone played. 
"Then," Bassett says, "people got tired of that." Later, he brought a chess 
set. And there was a cribbage tournament, but, he says, "I don't think there 
was ever a winner declared." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of court, did the trial take over his life? "It really did," he says. 
"There was so much stress." On weekends and during breaks, he went into the San 
Gabriel Mountains to "find a stream and hike along it, just to kind of get away 
from it all." 
</P>
<P>
Some nights, he combatted the tension and frustration by jogging on the CalTech 
track, near his home, or by working out in the CalTech weight room. Sometimes 
he simply stayed home and indulged in "mindless recreation," including 
Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
His roommates, a teacher's aide and an engineer, understood that he could not 
discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
At home, of course, he had to make a point of avoiding reading about or seeing 
television coverage of the case. The latter presented no problem, he says, 
because he rarely watches anything except "sports and national news." He judged 
by the number of reporters and cameras in the court on a given day how likely 
it was there would be newspaper coverage the next day. If the gallery was full, 
he says, "it was probably best to avoid reading the paper.' 
</P>
<P>
As he drove home each night in his tan Ford Escort, the judge's daily 
admonition to jurors rang in his head: "It is your duty not to converse among 
yourselves, or with anyone else," the sign-off line that he knew by heart. 
</P>
<P>
During mini-breaks in the trial, he backpacked in the Sierra. Each Christmas, 
he flew home to Pittsburgh to see his parents. 
</P>
<P>
And, insofar as possible, he kept up his routine, which includes Bible study at 
Lake Avenue Congregational Church in Pasadena, two nights a month at Cal 
Tech/JPL Toastmasters, and one night a week as a volunteer at Harambee, a 
private Pasadena foundation providing tutoring and computer education to 
disadvantaged youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The judicial system, Bassett observes, is "not designed for trials running this 
long." Often, he wondered, "Why can't these guys hurry up and get the show on 
the road and let us go off and live our own lives?" 
</P>
<P>
During summer, 1988, he received a call from a headhunter in Houston wanting to 
talk with him about a job. Pounders then was estimating "we'd certainly be done 
by April, 1989. He thought it would be sooner than that." 
</P>
<P>
The estimate proved to be unduly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Nov. 2, 1989, the McMartin jurors retired to deliberate, taking 
their places around an octagonal table in a 15th-floor Superior Court room 
about 20 by 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
After choosing Chang as foreman, they reviewed the long hours of testimony. "We 
started with the child who started the case, then requested all exhibits 
relevant to him and made a list of the testimony and discussed what was 
relevant." 
</P>
<P>
Starting typically at 9:30 each morning and continuing until about 4 in the 
afternoon, when, Bassett says, "you could tell people were just kind of wearing 
down," they repeated the procedure, day after day, child by child. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the jurors found the defendants, Raymond Buckey, 31, and Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, 63, not guilty of 52 counts of molestation; they deadlocked on 
13 counts against Raymond Buckey, who will be retried on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
There was no single moment of enlightenment for jurors, Bassett says; it was, 
rather, a long sorting out, sifting out process. "There were times," he says, 
"when things got heated, when people's tempers got short." 
</P>
<P>
But what became evident to him was that each juror felt "a certain respect for 
the others for having gone through all this." 
</P>
<P>
These 12 were, in short, survivors. They had managed to grasp what Bassett 
defines as "a certain ownership of the system. In order to stay sane, you had 
to convince yourself that it was somehow worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that it was. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett has little interest in debating the verdicts. Asked if he believes Ray 
Buckey was innocent or guilty, he says he cannot give "yes" or "no" answers. He 
has, he says, "a feeling of confusion . . . so many good people locked in such 
implacable conflict. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He adds "Gee, it would be nice if we could hop in a time machine and zip back 
and go and watch and see if anything happened" to the children. But "given the 
limitations of the evidence we had to rely on," he is convinced the jury did 
its job. 
</P>
<P>
Some McMartin parents, voiced outrage about the verdicts, have been campaigning 
for the retrial. Bassett says he understands what they have been going through. 
Public opinion, clearly, has been in conflict with the jurors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett, however, says he is at peace with the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing of prosecutors' decision to retry Buckey, Bassett said, "Here we go 
again, for another 2 1/2 years. . . . I have to agree with the judge that this 
case is really poison to everybody that's come in contact with it." 
</P>
<P>
Jury-bashing has been rampant, Bassett says: "I think a lot of it really is 
unfair. I mean, people with a particular point of view can just put their side 
of the evidence forward and say, yes, this is the evidence and why didn't the 
jury agree with us. There's no one to put forth the other side." 
</P>
<P>
When the trial ended, "I thought I would just basically disappear and never be 
heard from again," he says, adding, "I'm a private person." 
</P>
<P>
But when he arrived home the afternoon of Jan. 18, there were already six 
messages on his answering machine, three from the media. Geraldo has called, as 
has 60 Minutes and People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett still is weighing the experience of being a McMartin juror, and, thus, 
a footnote to history. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," he says, "I'm just trying to repair the damage and get life back 
to normal. I have a feeling that, five or 10 years down the road, after all the 
immediate damage has been repaired, it'll probably be something I look upon as 
a worthwhile experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's kind of a satisfaction in feeling that 12 of us who were chosen 
randomly could end up being a team, that we could deal with all that evidence 
and hopefully, at the end, make some rational sense out of it." 
</P>
<P>
He says of the experience, "It'll be something to tell my grandchildren about." 
</P>
<P>
And if he were to receive another summons to jury duty? 
</P>
<P>
Bassett smiles and says, "I would probably make some effort to be excused." 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ: KENNY BURRELL BRINGS HIS DELICATE TOUCH TO ELARIO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenny Burrell may not set his guitars on fire or dish up screaming electronic 
licks, but his playing burns in its own mellow way. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, who opened three weeks at Elario's last night, is one of jazz's finest 
technicians, using a delicate style honed by his experiences in jazz, blues and 
classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burrell plays most tunes with a pick, he also uses finger style to 
soften his sound. 
</P>
<P>
"My classical training certainly helped me with that," he said. "I can use my 
pick or my fingers or a combination." 
</P>
<P>
He has worked with giants ranging from John Coltrane to Yusef Lateef and Tommy 
Flanagan, but Burrell is especially partial to the music of Duke Ellington, 
having taught a course in Ellington's music at UCLA. Most sets include at least 
one Ellington number. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really very fond of his music and the music of those associated with him, 
Billy Strayhorn and the rest," Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of a year, Burrell keeps busy in a variety of musical 
settings. He toured Japan last fall with a trio that included drummer Sherman 
Ferguson, who will back Burrell with local bassist Bob Magnusson. He recently 
recorded with a quartet including Jay Hoggard on vibes, an instrument not 
featured often these days. Burrell met Hoggard during a session in a Manhattan 
church two years ago, and the two hit it off. The album, titled "Guiding 
Spirit," is due out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
One of his pet projects is his Jazz Guitar Band, which includes up-and-coming 
guitarists Rodney Jones and Bobby Broom. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his lyrical work on guitar, Burrell has a good set of pipes, and 
usually sings a tune or two at his live dates. He is good friends with fellow 
guitarists Mundell Lowe and Barney Kessel, both of whom have relocated to San 
Diego. Burrell doesn't rule out the possibility of an impromptu jam if they're 
in town and happen to show up at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego pianist Mike Wofford, who works regularly with Ella Fitzgerald and 
other jazz legends, reportedly jumps at each chance he gets to play with local 
clarinet man Bobby Gordon. Though his name is not known to many San Diegans, 
Gordon is a force on the local and national jazz scenes. Every Friday night, he 
plays the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach with the Chicago 6. Sunday and 
Wednesday nights, the band is at the Mission Inn in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon is also a charismatic front man. Until a few weeks ago, he and veteran 
Big Band trumpeter John Best had a loyal audience for their Sunday afternoon 
sets at Diego's disco in Pacific Beach. The club is closed for remodeling, but 
this Sunday night from 6 to 10 at the Salmon House on Mission Bay, Gordon will 
play with Wofford, bassist Bob Haggart and drummer Barry Farrar. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon came up under the guidance of clarinet master Joe Marsala in Chicago. He 
played around the Windy City for several years in the '60s, moved to New York, 
then back to Chicago, where he had his closest brush with fame. Trumpeter Louis 
Armstrong's "Hello, Dolly!" was riding high when Armstrong's clarinet man 
passed away and Gordon got the call to replace him. Before he got to play, 
though, Armstrong became ill, was hospitalized and eventually retired. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Gordon still prefers traditional jazz, the kind with a logical, 
linear melody. He plays at jazz festivals across the country, and has a new CD 
out with Hal Smith's Rhythm Makers, available by mail (Jazzology Records, 1206 
Decatur St., New Orleans, La., 70116). You can also hear his horn on the sound 
track for the new movie "Everybody Wins," starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. 
Expect this Sunday's live performance to lean on his favorite tunes, the stuff 
of Bix Beiderbecke, Pee Wee Russell, Eddie Condon and Eubie Blake. 
</P>
<P>
KiFM's (98.1) new "Straight Ahead Jazz" show, the successor to "Mainly 
Mainstream," had a disappointing debut last Sunday night. Hosts Steve Satkowski 
and Jim Merod, who together replaced Paul Lavoie, need work on content and 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
Merod's interview with pianist Kenny Barron (who, not coincidentally, just 
finished a run at Elario's, the show's sponsor) came off like some lost lines 
from a Charles Bukowski novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Merod: I did not even realize that "Phantoms" could go in the direction with 
that degree of power that you and Benny (Golson) took it to. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron: "Phantoms" is the kind of tune that can go many different directions. 
When I play it with my quintet, it goes even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Merod: I don't see how it can go any further than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insights into the music and where, exactly, it went, would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
Satkowski's "Straight From the Hip," intended as a Michael Tuck-like opinion 
piece, seemed more like an extended pat on the back for Elario's, where 
Satkowski is musical director. After describing the admirable successes and 
growth of KPBS' "Club Date" TV program, produced in conjunction with Elario's 
with Satkowski as associate producer, Satkowski played up the show even more: 
"Why didn't New York think of this concept first?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, the 10-to-midnight show needs more on-air personality from its 
hosts and more meaningful content. It should also be made less of a commercial 
for Elario's, even if the club is the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Nearly 300 people -- a record house -- packed the Salmon House Jan. 14 
to hear Padres pitcher/jazz guitarist Eric Show trade licks with saxophonist 
Gary Lefebvre. If the audience was loaded with baseball fans out for a glimpse 
of their idol, they also seemed to know his music, requesting several tunes 
from Show's newest album. . . . Mike Wofford plays solo piano from 8 to 11 
Friday night at the Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach. He'll also man the 
piano during happy hour Thursday and Friday and from 3 to 7 p.m. Saturday at 
the new Hyatt Regency on La Jolla Village Drive.

LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE SNARES A FUGARD PREMIERE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: SOUTH AFRICAN'S PLAY TO BE THE CENTERPIECE OF A SEASON THAT ALMOST 
WASN'T.

<P>
Perseverance paid off big for La Jolla Playhouse this year. 
</P>
<P>
Des McAnuff, the playhouse's artistic director, pursued Athol Fugard's newest 
play, "My Children! My Africa!" with a tenacity that convinced the renowned 
South African playwright to direct its West Coast premiere at the Playhouse. It 
will be the centerpiece of the 1990 season, July 8-Aug. 12 at the Mandell Weiss 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"My Children! My Africa!" joins two world premieres by veteran Playhouse 
artists Geoff Hoyle and Keith Reddin and Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in the 
six-play season that extends from May 13-Nov. 18. The last two shows, which 
have yet to be announced, may be classical or new musicals or dramas, McAnuff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The season was assembled despite the threat that there would be no season. It 
was only two weeks ago that the playhouse announced that its fund-raisers had 
produced $60,000 over the $500,000 McAnuff said was needed by Dec. 31 to ensure 
the 1990 season. The theater still needs to raise an additional $440,000 by 
June 30 to achieve financial stability. "But I see a light shining now," said 
McAnuff. "We're still here and we're talking about the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Fugard play, which closed in January at the 99-seat New York Theatre 
Workshop, was inspired by a tragic incident about a black South African teacher 
trying to work within the apartheid system. It marks a return to the overtly 
political subjects Fugard has slowly veered away from in his increasingly 
inward-looking works like "The Road to Mecca" and "A Place With the Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fugard, who is white, said in a telephone interview that despite its 
theme, this play is, if anything, more personal than anything else he has 
written. That effect was heightened when he cast and directed his own daughter, 
Lisa Fugard, in the part of the white student who comes to look at the black 
teacher as a mentor and father figure. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think in a way that the black schoolteacher is an intellectual and 
emotional portrait of myself," said Fugard. "I stand for what he stands for -- 
the faith in the power of words which I have him articulate in this play. He's 
a man who believes in non-violence." 
</P>
<P>
The theater's pursuit of Fugard's play began as far back as last August when 
Susan Hilferty, who designed the set for its premiere at the Market Theatre in 
Johannesburg, South Africa in June, came to the Playhouse to design "The 
Misanthrope" and told McAnuff about the play. McAnuff read the script and -- 
through sheer persistence, according to Fugard -- persuaded him to direct his 
first show on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Des and Robert Blacker (associate director of the Playhouse) read it and they 
said, 'My God, we'd like to do this,' and they stayed very firm in their 
desire. I drove down to (La Jolla to) see 'Macbeth' and that confirmed my 
desire to do the play here." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of the great plays," confirmed McAnuff. "(It's) going to be 
pertinent for a long time to come. There's just a lot of joy and humanity in 
the writing. We were lucky he let us read this play when it was hot off the 
press. Someone watched me reading it, and said before I even said anything, 
'You really liked that play, didn't you.' I was very moved." 
</P>
<P>
All three of the play's role are being re-cast for La Jolla's production. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse season will open with "Twelfth Night," under McAnuff's direction, 
May 13-June 17 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre. The premiere of Reddin's "Life 
During Wartime," a black comedy about a home security system salesman, is 
slated for June 24-July 29 in the Warren Theatre. Les Waters, who staged 
Reddin's "Nebraska" at the playhouse last year, will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyle, whose La Jolla Playhouse production of "The Fool Show" is headed for New 
York in the spring under the title "Feast of Fools," is still developing an as 
yet untitled show to run in the Warren Theatre Aug. 12-Sept. 16.

STAGE WATCH: 'HEIDI' HEADS FOR L.A. -- BUT EXPECT A WAIT; LYMAN TO CLOSE DOORS 
OF DIRECTORS' THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Heidi" is coming to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But don't hold your breath waiting for the national tour of "The Heidi 
Chronicles," last year's multi-award-winning comedy by Wendy Wasserstein. Its 
producer Jim Walsh reports that it has been tentatively penciled in for a 
12-week run at the Doolittle Theatre, beginning on April 1 or 2, 1991, as part 
of the next Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson season. No casting has been set. 
</P>
<P>
ADT FOLDS: "I'm looking for Producers Anonymous at this point," said Dorothy 
Lyman. 
</P>
<P>
She was talking about her decision to close A Directors' Theatre, an 
organization she founded, ran and subsidized. The group has staged 12 
productions and 35 readings at the Lex Theatre in Hollywood during the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
There were "a lot of reasons" for her decision, many of them related to the 
concurrent end of "Mama's Family," the syndicated TV series on which she played 
Naomi. 
</P>
<P>
"In a 50-seat theater, there is always a deficit, which I could pick up because 
I was overpaid for my TV work," said Lyman. She ended up spending 50% of her 
salary on the theater. "I thought if I seeded it for three years, enough other 
people would take the responsibility to make sure it stuck around." 
</P>
<P>
But the other people failed to materialize in sufficient numbers. The theater 
attracted only 168 subscribers at last count, "and most of them never showed 
up." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a terrible fund-raiser," acknowledged Lyman, "and I never found a proper 
managing director (to run the business side of the theater)." She also was 
"disappointed with my directors about 80% of the time," discouraged by the lack 
of press attention devoted to the theater's recent young playwrights contest, 
and disheartened by the battles that flared in Actors' Equity over new rules in 
smaller theaters. That controversy prompted Lyman to resign from the stage 
actors' union. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she concluded that "there are a lot of other people who can produce 
smaller theater well. We just didn't distinguish ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Lyman will direct ADT's last show, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," opening Feb. 
14, and also will direct a new play for the New Place Theatre Co. in Rolling 
Hills Estates next fall, but generally she hopes to concentrate on her acting 
career. "I need a new job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
SLOW DELIVERY: The first performance of "Love Letters" at Pasadena Playhouse 
has been postponed from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25. It had been scheduled for the 
mainstage; later performances would transfer to the smaller Balcony Theatre. 
But artistic director Susan Dietz decided the mainstage was too big for the 
play and shifted the entire "Love Letters" run to the Balcony, which wasn't 
available until the later date . . . The opening of "Wooman, Lovely Wooman" at 
the Tiffany has been postponed from Feb. 8 to Feb. 16, with previews now 
starting on Feb. 9. "Production elements are taking a lot longer than we 
thought they would," said L.A. Theatre Works producer Susan Loewenberg. 
</P>
<P>
FREE AT THE TAPER: Kenneth Branagh and members of his Renaissance Theatre 
Company will discuss their productions of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "King 
Lear" on March 2 at 3 p.m. in the Mark Taper Forum. Reservations are required; 
call (213) 972-0775. 
</P>
<P>
"Other Voices," the Mark Taper Forum's workshop for writers with physical or 
sensory disabilities, will present free public performances of four scenes 
Monday at 7:30 p.m. at the Music Center Annex, 601 W. Temple St. Another four 
scenes will be presented Feb. 12. Information: (213) 597-6511.

'HOW TO READ A DIRTY MOVIE' AT THE NUART; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: CRITIC SUSIE BRIGHT'S COMMENTARY WITH FILM CLIPS IS DESIGNED TO COMBAT 
'SEXUAL ILLITERACY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Susie Bright, like many feminists, has a strong point of view about 
pornographic films, but it's not what you think. She is in favor of them. In a 
big way. And she loves to talk about them, which she will do tonight and 
Thursday at the Nuart, in a presentation titled "How to Read a Dirty Movie." 
</P>
<P>
The program is a combination of hard-core film clips and commentary designed to 
help curb what Bright sees as the "sexual illiteracy" or "erotophobia" plaguing 
the moral left as well as the right. It's educational, all right -- you'll see 
oddities in her clips they'd never show you in anatomy class -- but her 
"literacy" lesson is not for Barbara Bush, or the faint of heart, or really for 
anyone at all besides the terminally curious or already-converted sexual 
libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
As "erotic movie critic" for Penthouse Forum magazine (as well as editor of On 
Our Backs, a lesbian sex journal), Bright often finds herself, as she proudly 
explains, "the lone woman in the Pussycat Theatre." She is unlikely to lure too 
many more converts there from the feminist mainstream with this dissertation. 
Her lecturing has a vaguely political veneer, but basically, she considers 
pornography to be successful art if it's successfully arousing. 
</P>
<P>
For all the rigmarole, it seemingly comes back to this: You either enjoy 
watching people do the wild thing for the wild thing's sake or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Bright clearly does, and her banter -- sometimes funny and perceptive, 
sometimes unintentionally disturbing -- runs the gamut from professorial to 
unabashedly voyeuristic. One minute our narrator is offering erudite commentary 
on how societal gender differences are reflected (or subverted) in porn, an 
honestly interesting subject; the next she is fannishly wowing over actress 
Georgina Spelvin's ability to simultaneously service a horde of demons in "The 
Devil in Miss Jones, Part 3." 
</P>
<P>
Bright is hardly your typical apologist for the porn industry; she barely 
mentions production values or the quality of the stories. Sex scenes are what 
she is most interested in, whether from 35mm films or zero-budget underground 
videos. ("There've been so many times I've seen an R-rated movie and wanted 
them to go one step further," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Her big gripe as a "sexually radical feminist" isn't that porn degrades women, 
but that it doesn't portray nearly as many women's orgasms on screen as men's. 
But in spite of this sexism, Bright still cheerfully accentuates the positive, 
surveying a wide scope of modern sexploitation -- sadomasochism and all -- and 
showing "outstanding" clips from her private collection that have "a spark of 
originality, creativity or rebelliousness." 
</P>
<P>
But these "positive" examples she puts up on screen may be what is most 
damaging to her case with an audience: Many of the clips involve what most 
viewers of any sexual persuasion would consider unconscionable cruelty. These 
range from the usual spankings and such to severe verbal abuse, to an 
unbearably protracted sex-and-murder scene (with Jamie Gillis doing the 
strangling). Don't expect any moralizing from Bright; she likes porn films that 
raise "ambiguous feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Meese and Jesse Helms are the only ones who get to talk about pornography 
on a public scale," Bright says. Her screenside chats are her way of balancing 
the ledger. And though she is too ingenuous to be really pushy in her 
radicalism, you're still made to feel that if you have a hang-up about, say, 
the intermingling of sex and violence, you're more a Meese than a man. Even 
viewers well to the left of her Republican nemeses may still come away feeling 
they learned how to read Susie Bright better than they learned how to look 
between the frames of her dirty movies. 
</P>

The program begins both nights at 8. Information: (213) 473-6701.

'HEROES' GETS A MEDAL AS RECRUITMENT TOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"Heroes," airing tonight at 5 and 9 on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable 
channel, promises viewers that it will capture "the incredible life stories of 
some of the world's most courageous individuals." Only Western countries need 
apply -- the men and one woman profiled were awarded either the U.S. Medal of 
Honor, Great Britain's Victoria Cross or France's Legion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by former ABC news executive Av Westin ("20/20"), the 26-part series 
kicks off with an overview episode, setting the stage for the profiles to come. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the show's second episode -- and first profile -- on Brig. Gen. 
Patrick Brady, "Heroes" comes across as a skillful recruiting tool for the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
This can be expected from Brady, who was honored for action in Vietnam in 1968 
and who is now the head of public affairs at the Pentagon, but Westin has to 
take the major part of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt about Brady's courage. A helicopter pilot who specialized in 
flying in thick fog, he won his Medal of Honor for one horrendous day in 
Vietnam when he rescued 51 wounded soldiers in heavy combat zones. "Just a man 
doing his job," he says, "in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
But Westin's choices of footage -- even the ones with bloody casualties -- and 
the interviews and narration subtly glamorize the war. And Brady's "right 
place" was a battlefield where thousands died over the years -- a battlefield 
that still adversely affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of veterans and 
refugees today. 
</P>
<P>
Other episodes will include veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and one 
Frenchman honored for his deeds during action in Algeria in the '60s. MARTIN

CIVIC CENTER'S COST COULD SOAR BY $11 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: THE DEVELOPER DEPARTED IN A DISPUTE WITH THE CITY COUNCIL. NOW 
THE COUNCIL HAS ALLOCATED EXTRA MONEY FOR A NEW BUILDER TO FINISH THE POLICE 
STATION AND LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It may cost up to $11 million more than originally planned to finish building 
the police headquarters and public library at the Beverly Hills Civic Center, 
city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The extra cost was blamed on the recent departure, amid general ill feeling, of 
general contractor J. A. Jones Inc., which claims that the city owes it about 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, the second-largest construction contractor in the United States, had 
done about 90% of the job before its workers left the job in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council then voted to fire the North Carolina-based firm, and the 
$53-million project at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive 
has been quiet ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Gaping holes remain in the ornate tile that decorates the walls and arches of 
the police station and library, and piles of steel are strewn on the unpaved 
stretch that was once Rexford Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But work goes on at the 58-year-old City Hall across the street, which is being 
renovated under the supervision of another contractor, and city workers are 
expected to leave their temporary quarters and move in later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute came as a blow to the council, whose members had vowed to see the 
5-year-old project finished by this spring. 
</P>
<P>
When he became mayor last April, City Councilman Max Salter declared: "I 
solemnly swear, take an oath, commit, pledge that the Civic Center will be 
finished before I leave office, even if I have to pour cement, paint and 
plaster it myself." 
</P>
<P>
Now he will say only, "It isn't pretty, and the lawyers will have a field day." 
</P>
<P>
But Salter may not have to get his hands dirty, because a new contractor is 
likely to take over as early as next week, according to Howard Rattner, 
economic development manager for the city. 
</P>
<P>
At a session held behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon, the council considered 
several candidates for the job and also discussed possible legal action in its 
dispute with the Jones firm, Rattner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of not having the money to pay them. It has to do with 
their view of what is owed and the city's view of what is owed," Vice Mayor 
Allan L. Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides said they hope to avoid going to court, each insisted that 
the other was out of line. Jones contends that the job expanded beyond what it 
had agreed to do because of problems including asbestos and ground water; the 
city said the work was covered in its contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't pay them money that we don't think they deserved," Rattner said. 
"We met with them several times to try to resolve the dispute, but we have to 
go on with the project." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson Welch, senior business development manager for Jones' western 
regional office, said the company had been paying its subcontractors out of its 
own pocket and fruitlessly billing the city for three months. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only go so many months before you have to get paid," he said. "We were 
floating somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million, and it's just not 
prudent." 
</P>
<P>
Clients and contractors often fall out over money, but Welch said it is 
"extremely rare" for a major firm such as his to walk off the job or be fired. 
"Ordinarily, negotiations resolve it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction costs for the police station and library had been estimated at $53 
million, but the council voted last week to set aside another $11 million to 
finish the job with a new contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Intended to replace cramped quarters dating back to the early years of Beverly 
Hills cityhood, the Civic Center complex includes a modern fire station that 
has been in use for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The new police station is similarly up to date, bringing reality closer to the 
slick headquarters depicted in the "Beverly Hills Cop" movies. The gritty old 
station was more like a set from a 1940s detective thriller. 
</P>
<P>
The library will include an automated circulation system that will allow 
librarians and patrons to quickly determine whether books are available. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Millard, library staffer in charge of the move, said the new quarters are 
"quite close to completion," with stacks and some carpets in place but "a lot 
of finish work" remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure when we're moving in, so operations will continue uninterrupted 
until we have some more definite word from the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The library, police station and City Hall offices are housed in temporary 
quarters within walking distance of the Civic Center site.

HOLOCAUST: JEWS SAVED AS YOUNGSTERS FROM THE NAZIS GATHER TO SHARE THEIR 
MEMORIES.

</HEADLINE>

Anne Steinberg drove from Laguna Hills to the Fairfax District on Monday night 
to see a documentary that captured painful images of her past. 
</P>
<P>
"Ach, why do they have to show so much of this stuff?" she muttered, stiffly 
turning away. She glanced back, then flinched again. The screen showed Nazis in 
1938, on the eve of the Holocaust, smashing Jewish shops, gutting synagogues, 
dragging people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg shared these memories with about 60 others at the Westside Jewish 
Community Center on Olympic Boulevard, at the first reunion of Los Angeles-area 
Kinder -- the children saved by the British from Hitler's camps in a legendary, 
last-minute exodus called the Kindertransport. 
</P>
<P>
While other nations (including the United States) were protesting through 
diplomatic channels or ignoring ignoring the unfolding horror in Nazi Germany 
altogether, the British government swung into action in late 1938. Between 
December, 1938, and the start of World War II the following September, about 
10,000 children, 80% of them Jewish, were brought to England from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
There was little formal ceremony about Monday's reunion, just coffee, 
refreshments and earnest conversation among people who had shared an intense 
experience, however painful. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Why am I alive and the others not?' is the difficult question you ask 
yourself all the time," said Fay Shaw, who watched the film with a sad, knowing 
expression. "I think this question to myself every day." 
</P>
<P>
Her searching expression dissolved into a shrug: "There is no answer. There is 
guilt. There is pain in the memory. But still, you remember." 
</P>
<P>
"This is remarkable, to look across a table and see someone else has survived 
from a whole time of your life that is gone," added Paula Balkin, who had come 
up from San Diego for the reunion. She and Shaw, both from Leipzig, knew each 
other as children and met again last year in London at a worldwide reunion of 
the Kinder (pronounced Kin-der), which provided the impetus for subsequent 
local gatherings such as Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
Times with fellow survivors, said Balkin, are a solace, offering "a feeling of 
belonging you do not get with others." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly all of them, the exodus experience was identical except for minor 
details: After being chosen through a chain of British and Jewish welfare 
agencies, the unaccompanied children were put on trains with nothing but a 
backpack or a suitcase. The trip to the German border was a nervous one: Would 
the Nazis interfere? One father rode with his daughter to the border, to make 
sure she was safe, and jumped off. She remembered him waving. The trains, from 
Vienna, Frankfurt, Cologne and other cities, went to ports in France and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the boat to England, when the reality, and the homesickness, set 
in for many. In England, the children were lodged in various temporary camps, 
later with Jewish and Gentile foster families. 
</P>
<P>
Balkin was among several people who said they are only now starting to face 
memories long locked away. "My husband has woken me from nightmares many 
nights," she said. "My children have woken me from nightmares. But I did not 
talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The awful dreams she and others described were of last embraces, trains forever 
pulling away. In their sleep, they search through concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching England, where few spoke the language, they clung to letters and 
postcards from home that one day just stopped coming. Said Shaw, who escaped 
with a sister: "My mother wrote only about my sister and I. 'Do not worry about 
us,' (she wrote). She did not think about herself." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, whose maiden name was Mendzigursky, never again saw her mother or a 
second sister who stayed behind. She learned after the war that they had frozen 
to death on trains going to the Riga concentration camp. Her father managed to 
escape from a camp and joined her in England. 
</P>
<P>
The full story for those present Monday began when Hitler came to power in 
1933. Between 1933 and 1938, a succession of laws and decrees deprived Jews of 
citizenship and eventually turned them literally into outlaws. Children had to 
stay away from school. They heard whispered conversations of worried parents 
who had lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some families could not, or would not, fully grasp Hitler's purpose 
until the explosive anti-Semitic violence of Nov. 9 and 10, 1938 -- 
Kristallnacht. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched it from my bedroom window," Balkin said. "The synagogue was right 
down the street from our house and I saw it going up in flames. I saw our 
neighbors being taken out of their homes and beaten." 
</P>
<P>
After Kristallnacht, German Jews became frantic. They placed ads in The Times 
of London pleading with the English to take their children. They wrote to 
distant relatives in England or America. On Nov. 21, the British House of 
Commons spent 3 1/2 hours debating the problems faced by German Jewry. The Home 
Office agreed to skip the formalities of passports and visas for shipments of 
children. The first group arrived on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Balkin, whose maiden name is Grunbaum, had an uncle who became active in the 
effort to evacuate children and made sure that those from his family got to go.

HALL RULES OUT 4TH COUNCIL TERM, TAKES LOBBYIST JOB

<P>
Veteran City Council member Jan Hall answered the lingering question of whether 
she would run for a fourth term with a "no" this week, signaling the end of a 
12-year council career but not of her political aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Her announcement came as no surprise. While others have declared their 
intentions to run for her 3rd District seat and launched their campaigns for 
the April election, Hall's political machine has remained idle, her supporters 
unsure of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing her bid for the new full-time mayor's position two years ago, Hall 
has maintained a low profile on the council, turning her energies to her duties 
as a board member of the Southern California Rapid Transit District and her 
quest for an appointment in the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Her horizons went out beyond the district," noted one supporter. "The 
district's a tough district. She survived three terms by the skinny skin skin, 
and it was really time for her to move on in life." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Monday in her City Hall office, Hall said she had 
resigned her RTD position, would not seek reelection and was taking a 
$75,000-a-year job with a private consulting firm to act as a lobbyist for the 
transit district -- a move that has raised the eyebrows of other district 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hall, 47, said she wanted to make "it absolutely clear that, 
although I am now pursuing this private-sector opportunity . . . I am not 
ruling out further public service, either in an elected or appointed capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Chair of the California State Commission on the Status of Women and the RTD 
board president for two of her nearly nine years as a director, Hall has made 
no secret of her ambitions. She attempted last year to parlay her experience 
into a federal transportation appointment and she said she remains "on lists" 
of prospective Bush appointees. 
</P>
<P>
More realistic, say supporters, is the possibility of a state appointment if 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican, becomes the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the lobbying job for the RTD -- which oversees regional mass 
transit -- would keep her in political circles and flesh out her resume with a 
full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has been hired as a vice president of CBC Consulting Inc. of Torrance, 
overseeing an 18-month contract with RTD to lobby on legislative issues and 
deal with the media. 
</P>
<P>
While Hall's hop from the RTD board to a company doing business with the 
transit district does not violate the district's rules, it has stirred critical 
comments from some board directors who complain that the contract was never 
considered by the full board. 
</P>
<P>
Under RTD regulations, the $99,500 contract did not have to go before the 
board, since it was just under the $100,000 cutoff that requires board 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members said Alan F. Pegg, RTD general manager, consulted with 
them individually about the contract and Hall's prospective involvement with 
the company before signing it. They nonetheless went on to attack Pegg's 
handling of the contract, although they avoided any criticism of Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the services Jan can offer the district are very valuable," director 
Jeff Jenkins said. "I don't necessarily question her as much as the general 
manager and the way (the contract) was approached . . . It just looked like a 
quid pro quo deal." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need public relations," declared director Nick Patsaouras, arguing 
that the CBC contract money was ill spent and that the matter should have been 
debated by the entire board. 
</P>
<P>
The district has several employees in its governmental affairs office who 
handle legislative matters, as well as a spokesman who deals with the press, 
said the spokesman, Greg Davy. "Sometimes they need outside help," he 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
Hall could not be reached to respond to the directors' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's decision not to pursue a fourth term on the City Council gives a boost 
to the declared contenders in the 3rd District, which covers the southeast 
corner of the city, an area known for its affluent shoreline neighborhoods and 
competitive council races. 
</P>
<P>
Dentist Jim Serles, a planning commissioner who twice before challenged Hall 
and lost, has already built a well-oiled campaign effort for his third attempt 
and is bound to pick up some support from his former opponent's camp. 
</P>
<P>
But Serles could still be seen as the enemy by many Hall backers, who may turn 
their allegiance to Doug Drummond, a retired police commander who is making his 
first council bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of her support would go to Drummond," said Jim Gray, a local 
bank executive and friend of Hall. "But as far as the overall race is concerned 
. . . (Hall) getting out of the race has to make Jim (Serles) the favorite, at 
least in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Louis Mirabile, also is running, and the field of contenders 
could grow further, as Hall's Monday announcement still left some time for new 
candidates to enter the race and file their nomination papers with the city 
clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP Because incumbent Long Beach City Councilwoman Jan Hall is not 
running for reelection this April, City Council candidates in the 3rd District 
will get another five days to file their nomination papers with the city 
clerk's office. The filing deadline for that district has been extended from 
today to Feb. 6.

DESPITE FBI PROBE, MOORE APPEARS TO BE UNBEATABLE

<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore remains the odds-on favorite to win reelection in her 
Westside district, even though she has been a target of a political corruption 
investigation by the FBI for at least the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Both Republicans and fellow Democrats said the Los Angeles lawmaker appears 
unbeatable for a seventh term in November's election. 
</P>
<P>
"She is unequivocally strong in her district," said Rod Wright, a Democratic 
campaign consultant and activist. "I don't think anything would change unless 
she was indicted and convicted of a felony." Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff 
(R-Yucaipa), who oversees elections for the Assembly GOP Caucus, said there is 
a shortage of "high-caliber" Republican candidates to run against Moore, partly 
because of the huge registration edge Democrats hold in her 49th Assembly 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Even Eric Givens, a Republican who has plans to run against Moore for the third 
time, acknowledges he faces an uphill fight. "It's one of the longest shots of 
the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 46, is one of five state elected officials who are targets of the 
federal investigation. She carried two bills for a bogus shrimp company set up 
by the FBI as part of an elaborate sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The probe became public in August, 1988, when Moore's Capitol office was raided 
by federal agents. The dummy company had contributed money to her campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has not been charged with any crime and has maintained her innocence. 
When she testified last month as a defense witness at the political corruption 
trial of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), she was told by U.S. Atty. David 
Levi that she remains under active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The federal probe, which resulted in Montoya's indictment, has thrust the 
low-profile lawmaker into the spotlight more than at any time in her career. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians cite several reasons for her political strength. 
</P>
<P>
They say that with a 4-1 Democratic registration bulge, Moore would have to be 
charged with a crime before a serious, well-financed challenger would emerge to 
oppose her. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in Moore's favor, they say, is that she is a well-liked lawmaker 
whose career had not previously been touched by scandal. Moreover, she is 
generally given high marks for being responsive to her constituents, from the 
Crenshaw District to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that view on both sides of the political aisle, "people give her 
the benefit of the doubt" about the federal investigation, said Rick Taylor, a 
Democratic political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think that she's a dishonest person at all," said Los Angeles 
City Councilman Nate Holden, a one-time Democratic state senator. "That's my 
feeling. If anything went wrong, it's not because she knew it." 
</P>
<P>
After testifying at Montoya's trial, Moore told reporters: "I've done nothing 
wrong. I've tried to cooperate with every legitimate investigation. I have 
nothing to hide." Montoya faces 10 counts of extortion, racketeering and 
money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Montoya and Moore, two other lawmakers -- Republican Assemblymen 
Frank Hill of Whittier and Pat Nolan of Glendale -- are also targets of the 
investigation. Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Cypress), now a member of the 
State Board of Equalization, is also a target of the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation shadowed Moore's reelection efforts in 1988, but she 
overwhelmingly defeated Givens, a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
During the election, Givens charged that Moore had been too busy representing 
"phony businesses" to pay serious attention to the district, and he called for 
her to step down. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore captured 76.7% of the vote in the district that includes Leimert 
Park, Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Culver City, Ladera Heights, Cheviot Hills, 
Playa del Rey, Marina del Rey and parts of Westchester and Palms. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is not the first California lawmaker to campaign with the cloud of a 
federal investigation hanging over her head. In 1986, Assemblyman Mike Roos 
(D-Los Angeles) won reelection, even though his ties to fireworks magnate W. 
Patrick Moriarty were being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. In 
1987, federal prosecutors decided not to try Roos in connection with a 
profitable investment arranged by Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the current investigation does not appear to have had a significant 
impact on Assemblyman Hill's political clout. Hill is given a good chance of 
winning a special state Senate election scheduled for Tuesday. "I think he has 
the respect of everyone up here," said Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), the Senate 
minority leader. "For those of us who felt free to endorse him, we are 
embracing the idea that he's innocent until proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's supporters take a similar stance about the assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
Kerman Maddox, a former assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, asserted 
that if anyone runs against Moore and "uses the sting, it's an exercise in 
futility. It will mean nothing, simply because she has a good reputation. . . . 
People seem to think she got caught up in this because of bad staff work." 
</P>
<P>
At Montoya's trial, Moore testified that she agreed to carry the legislation 
because officials from the dummy company said it would create 35 to 40 jobs, 
most of them for minorities and "low-entry level people." 
</P>
<P>
Moore also testified that in 1986 she returned one $5,000 contribution from 
federal undercover agents because it appeared to be a bribe. But she told 
reporters she kept $2,000 given her in 1986 because the undercover operatives 
attended one of her fund-raisers. "They bought tickets, they came to my 
fund-raiser. They ate my food and so I kept the money," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Netters, then a Moore aide, helped steer two Moore bills to benefit the 
dummy company through the Legislature. The day after the Legislature gave final 
approval in 1988 to one of the bills, Netters, an unsuccessful candidate for a 
local utility board, reported receiving a $2,000 contribution to his campaign 
from the dummy company. 
</P>
<P>
William Julian, a spokesman for the assemblywoman, said Moore does not want to 
elaborate at this time on her views about the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore has voiced optimism about her reelection effort, saying that her 
constituents have been supportive of her during the investigation. "I am 
definitely running," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has lived in the area around her district since she was 2 years old. A 
former member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees, she was 
first elected to the Assembly in 1978. The contest drew several other black 
candidates and divided loyalties in the black community. Moore had support from 
the Democratic political organization of Los Angeles Reps. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Moore is regarded as a low-profile liberal who is loyal to Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) but is not part of his inner circle. A year ago, 
in a move seen as a vote of confidence, Brown named Moore as the Democratic 
whip to help shepherd legislation for Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, Moore wields 
clout in overseeing telephone and other utility rates. One of her best-known 
measures was a 1984 law to ensure that home telephone service remained 
affordable for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown this week called Moore "one of the best, if not the best" chairs 
of an Assembly committee. Brown said that until he named her to head the 
committee in 1983, he "never knew she had the talent. . . . This woman is 
awesome" in terms of knowing about utilities and negotiating compromises on 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But others question the way her office has performed, especially in the way 
bills for the dummy shrimp company were handled. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the role of Moore's aide, Netters, in the legislation, another 
Democratic colleague, who asked not to be identified, said: "I still feel she 
was duped by staff. . . . By God, it just looks to me that she was a victim. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jacobson, who left Moore's staff last year, acknowledged that the 
legislation on behalf of the dummy shrimp company "simply wasn't just that big 
a deal" for Moore's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have poor staff," Moore said. "We run as tight a ship as 
anyone. What happened could happen to anyone in the Legislature. It is not a 
reflection of poor staff." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said that partly because of the FBI investigation, Moore streamlined 
her office operation. "For one thing," he said, "we became much better 
organized in the office, kept better track of documentation . . . to avoid 
falling in this trap again." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic legislative staffer, who asked not to be identified, said that in 
the past Moore had a reputation for introducing legislation "without paying a 
whole lot of attention to the bills," especially these not dealing with the 
regulation of utilities. Now, he said, "she's probably more prudent about bills 
she carries." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Moore testified at Montoya's trial, Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park) said "it's been pretty hard" for Moore to constantly read 
"negative things" about herself. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner, Moore's seatmate on the Assembly floor, acknowledged that the 
investigation has been "agonizing for her. It's been a very traumatic thing for 
her." But Tanner maintained that it has not impacted Moore's performance. "She 
hasn't let it affect her at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the federal investigation was disclosed, Moore was mentioned in 
Sacramento as possible successor to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) if he 
decided to run for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors or some other 
office. Other lawmakers say it is unclear whether the investigation will pose a 
roadblock if Moore ever seeks higher office. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has not changed the way Republican strategists view 
the odds on Moore's winning reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"The district is very solidly Democratic," said Republican Assemblyman 
Woodruff. "I think it would be hard to convince the voters of that area that 
she hasn't been voting . . . the party line." 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff maintained that voters in the 49th District almost always vote 
Democratic. "If Ronald Reagan or George Bush or George Deukmejian cannot carry 
Gwen Moore's district," Woodruff said, it would be difficult for an unknown GOP 
candidate to beat Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Without commenting on the FBI investigation of Moore, Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) complained that an Assembly member "could be 
convicted of an ax murder three days before the election and still win 55% of 
the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her popularity, some elected officials question whether Moore has done 
enough for their cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a lot that she does particularly for Culver City," said Culver 
City Mayor Jozelle Smith, who said she is still upset that in April, 1988, 
Moore mounted a last-minute mail and telephone campaign on behalf of three 
council candidates. "I was angry about the interference . . . in our 
elections," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ronni Cooper, president of the Ladera Heights Civic Assn., said Moore is 
extremely responsive to her group's needs. She cited Moore's help about a year 
ago in blocking construction of a Southern California Rapid Transit District 
bus yard in her community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think her credibility has been hurt in our community" by the FBI 
investigation, Cooper said. "Every time we have needed her help . . . she has 
been there for us."

HOTEL HOLDS COURT TO MEET CASE BACKLOG

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Themis, the goddess of justice, might want to let go of the scales and lift her 
blindfold long enough to take a peek at this one: a Superior Court trial where 
the jurors sip ice water from long-stemmed glasses, the witness stand is 
festooned with a white-linen table skirt and the judge's chambers has a 
built-in mahogany vanity. 
</P>
<P>
It's a court trial all right, but it isn't going on at the overcrowded, 
worse-for-wear Long Beach courthouse. It's in the California Room at the 
Holiday Inn, right along with the "Stamp Out Foot Problems with Dr. Jeffrey" 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse has been stretched to its limits for years with an overwhelming 
number of felony criminal cases -- 3,271 in 1989 to be exact -- more than half 
of them drug-related, said Supervising Superior Court Judge Richard F. Charvat. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the nine judges at the courthouse are assigned to hear criminal cases 
just to keep up with the busloads of defendants who have a right to go to trial 
within 60 days or have their charges dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
That left just one judge and one courtroom in the courthouse to handle more 
than 1,700 civil matters also awaiting trial in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Observers have been warning for years that the courthouse would one day 
overflow. It finally did, right into the cylinder-shaped hotel at Lakewood 
Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in desperate need of a new facility or additional courtrooms, something 
that is not about to happen from what I have been told," Charvat said. "Long 
Beach can handle its own criminal load, but the sacrifice is that civil cases 
don't get the attention they deserve. And as a result, they get tried in hotel 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
At $125 a day for the room and $450 a day for the rented services of retired 
Superior Court Judge Carroll M. Dunnum, Los Angeles County is finally giving 
73-year-old William Rathje his day in court. 
</P>
<P>
Rathje contends that his wife, Netta, shot herself to death in their Lake 
Elsinore home at the age of 69 after she was diagnosed as having intestinal 
cancer, treated for 15 months, then told she never had cancer in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
He is suing a Riverside radiation group and a Long Beach psychiatrist, both of 
whom contend their encounter with the woman was brief and unrelated to her 
suicide nearly two years later. 
</P>
<P>
The case was filed almost five years ago -- the limit within which the law says 
civil cases must be brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
While Long Beach has often taken advantage of the county's so-called 
"rent-a-judge" program that hires retired judges to clear backlogged calendars, 
the city has always managed to find a spare courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
But an increasing number of drug cases and the city's growing population have 
outstripped court facilities that have not expanded since the courthouse was 
built in the 1960s, Charvat said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers were apprehensive at first that it would be difficult to keep an air of 
decorum while holding court on a green and purple geometric carpet. But the 
consensus, so far, is that justice is even better served at the Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Court starts precisely at 9:30 a.m. because the judge isn't juggling a dozen 
other matters. There is plenty of parking; fresh ice water is delivered twice a 
day and the 13th-floor restaurant with a panoramic view of Long Beach puts the 
courthouse snack bar to shame. 
</P>
<P>
When court officials worried that the judge and the witness stand were at an 
undignified eye-level with the jury, the hotel moved in a platform, complete 
with a purple skirt, to lift them to a more stately height. 
</P>
<P>
The judge misses his law library and private bathroom, but those minor 
inconveniences are more than offset by five solid hours of court time he says 
is put in daily, because there are no interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"You're lucky if you get three or 3 1/2 hours in at the courthouse," Dunnum 
said from his "chambers," a makeshift room behind a movable wall. "Here you 
don't have attorneys and processors running in and out and slamming doors and 
bodies rushing all around. And we can sit and guzzle ice water all day." 
</P>
<P>
Officials say hotel trials, which have been successful in Torrance and Santa 
Monica, could offer a much-needed reprieve in Long Beach, where one civil court 
judge struggles to do the work of four who sit in some branch courts. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for the Holiday Inn," said plaintiff's attorney John Thornton, 
"we'd still be waiting."

<P>
City building inspector Brent Miller has driven through Huntington Park's 
shopping district hundreds of times, never noticing the danger. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until he started compiling a list of unreinforced masonry buildings 
for the state Seismic Safety Commission that he realized many of the businesses 
in the bustling downtown area are "time bombs waiting to explode." 
</P>
<P>
Freshly painted or stuccoed buildings that look new from the street reveal a 
drastically different picture when inspected from the back alleys. Building 
after building along Pacific Boulevard is constructed of brick held together by 
60-year-old mortar. 
</P>
<P>
"The bomb is ticking right now," Miller said to a visitor recently as he 
pointed out a crack zigzagging up the back wall of a popular clothing store. 
"All it needs is the right combination of explosives: A 5.0 or greater 
earthquake and a busy shopping day." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park has 120 unreinforced masonry buildings, more than any other 
city in the area except Long Beach. The city of 50,000, founded in the early 
1920s, has been lucky, somehow escaping serious damage in past temblors. But 
who knows when its luck will run out. 
</P>
<P>
The state Seismic Safety Commission does not want to take any more chances. On 
Jan. 1, all cities in California were required under a 1986 state law to submit 
a list of unreinforced commercial and residential dwellings with more than four 
units. Communities also were required to prepare an ordinance that would make 
buildings less dangerous in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
All Southeast-Long Beach area cities, except for Bell, which claims it does not 
have the staff to identify the hazardous buildings, complied with the state 
law. Nearly 1,000 unreinforced masonry building were identified, 650 of them in 
Long Beach alone. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities in the area are refining their earthquake safety ordinances and 
searching for ways to help building owners make costly improvements on the 
hazardous structures, identified as the kind most likely to crumble in a 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
During an earthquake, the mortar in an unreinforced masonry building turns to 
dust. The roof and walls fall so quickly that people in or near the buildings 
have little time to escape, Miller said. In a powerful quake, the bricks can 
actually be catapulted across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Strengthening brick buildings with steel bars and beams "buys time" in a 
temblor, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"It (retrofitting) is not necessarily going to save the building," Miller said. 
"But it's going to give people about 20 minutes to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Scores of unreinforced masonry buildings in the Uptown Whittier area cracked 
and collapsed in the Oct. 1, 1987, temblor, which measured a magnitude of 5.9. 
There were more than 60 unreinforced masonry buildings before the quake, city 
officials estimate. Only 15 remain today. According to city officials, the main 
reason no one in the Uptown area was crushed to death by falling debris is 
because the temblor occurred at about 7:40 a.m., before businesses were open. 
</P>
<P>
'Almost Like Rubble' 
</P>
<P>
Dick Stollenwerk, a Long Beach civil engineer, calls unreinforced buildings 
"accidents waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"They are almost like a pile of rubble stacked in an orderly fashion," 
Stollenwerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Many buildings in the Los Angeles area were made of unreinforced masonry at the 
time of the Long Beach earthquake in 1933. After the deadly temblor, which 
killed 115 people and caused about $40-million damage, building techniques were 
quickly modified to include steel reinforcements. In cities established after 
1933, unreinforced masonry buildings are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach in 1971 was the first to adopt an ordinance requiring that all 
structures built before 1934 and not constructed of wood be reinforced to 
withstand earthquakes. In 1981, Los Angeles adopted a less stringent ordinance, 
which requires all but single-family homes built of unreinforced masonry to be 
upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Hensley, a spokesman for the state Seismic Safety Commission, said of the 
366 cities and counties affected by the state law, about 90 have given the 
state an inventory of their unreinforced masonry buildings and adopted 
mitigation programs to reduced earthquake hazards. Sixty-five other cities 
reported that they have no unreinforced masonry buildings, Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southeast-Long Beach area, eight cities, including Huntington Park, have 
adopted mitigation ordinances. Nine cities are exempt from establishing an 
ordinance, because they do not have unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining seven cities, except for Bell, have told the state that they are 
in the process of adopting mitigation programs. Pat West, the deputy city 
manager in Paramount, said an independent consulting company is still trying to 
identify the hazardous buildings. 
</P>
<P>
John Bramble, the city manager of Bell, said his city simply cannot afford to 
hire inspectors to find the hazardous buildings, a common argument in many of 
the cities that have failed to comply with the state law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not cheap," Bramble said. "We've had so many changes in staff . . . and 
have lost our building inspectors. Because of budget cuts we have not been able 
to hire (new inspectors)." 
</P>
<P>
Currently the state is trying to find a way to penalize cities and counties 
that do not comply with the law. But right now the state Seismic Safety 
Commission has no enforcement power. It is up to the cities to comply or not, 
Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, few cities have blatantly "thumbed their noses" at the state, Hensley 
said. Many of those that have missed the deadline have told the state Seismic 
Safety Commission that they will meet the requirements, they just need more 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that have complied with the law are formulating earthquake safety 
ordinances similar to those used in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, Hensley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances differ in the amount of time given owners to either upgrade or 
demolish. For example, in Huntington Park, which passed its earthquake safety 
ordinance in December, 1988, owners are given about four years to make the 
required improvements. Several buildings have already been upgraded, and 
improvements are starting on a few others, Miller said. In Whittier, city 
officials are considering giving building owners up to seven years to make the 
improvements. Los Angeles allows building owners about three years to comply 
with the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, if the improvements are not made, the buildings are closed or 
torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Bolts, Rods Used 
</P>
<P>
Unreinforced buildings usually are strengthened by bolting the roof, walls and 
floor together and running steal rods through the walls. The cost can range 
from $15 to $20 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state has set aside money for residential improvements, few funds 
are available for strengthening commercial structures. Most commercial building 
owners will have to obtain loans at the market interest rates from their banks, 
unless cities are able to find alternate funding. 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier, several building owners who survived the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake 
said it might have been better if they had lost their buildings in the powerful 
temblor, when low-interest federal loans and grants were available to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"People are scared," one building owner in Whittier said recently. "We don't 
want it (seismic retrofitting) to hurt too much." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach wants to purchase bonds, allowing building owners to borrow money at 
a 30-year fixed-interest rate to take some of the sting out of financing the 
improvements, 
</P>
<P>
Some building owners in Long Beach are calling the city's proposal a "godsend." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the buildings in the city are owned by senior citizens who can't get 
loans (from banks) with their fixed incomes," said Jack Finkelstein, who owns 
several buildings in the downtown area. "It (the bond issue) relieves the 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is the only city in the area that has come up with a financial 
assistance package. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," said Gene Rosecrans, a banker who recently spoke at a meeting 
of Huntington Park building owners. "There is just nothing available 
financially to help these people." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Hayek, a Huntington Park building owner, said he is paying for $155,000 
in improvements out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"The city should offer low-percentage loans," Hayek said. "It would be nice, 
especially since they are requiring this of us."

WATERY FIELD TRIP;

29 OCEANGOING 3RD-GRADERS OVERCOME SEASICKNESS AND WATCH MIGRATING CALIFORNIA 
GRAY WHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every roll and toss of the fishing boat made 8-year-old Gary Rose, who had 
never taken an ocean voyage before, more than a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
At first he huddled as far away as possible from the spray thrown by the choppy 
waves, wishing desperately to be back on land. 
</P>
<P>
But when the other members of his third-grade class spotted a whale, he 
abandoned caution and moved to the railing for a firsthand peek. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this," said Gary, who quickly lost his fear and began teasing his 
classmates with cries of "Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
Whale-watching season -- a chance to witness the annual migration of about 
20,000 California gray whales to and from the Baja Peninsula -- is in full 
swing in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
For the thousands of whale watchers who annually depart from the Ventura and 
Channel Islands harbors, the season conjures up images of high seas adventure 
and close-up views of the air-breathing mammals. 
</P>
<P>
The price for many is a few hours of stomach-churning seasickness, and the 
whale-watching expedition that left Channel Islands Harbor on a recent chilly 
Friday morning was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time at sea for 21 of the 29 students in Pam Mortenson's 
third-grade class from E.P. Foster School. 
</P>
<P>
The children from Foster, a kindergarten-through-third-grade school on Ventura 
Avenue, had collected and recycled aluminum cans since September to pay for the 
field trip. 
</P>
<P>
But Mortenson told the eager children that the $120 they had raised would not 
cover the $375 in trip expenses. The children were disappointed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week Jack Ward, who owns Captain Jack's Landing in Oxnard and was one 
of the founders of Channel Islands Harbor, donated the whale-watching voyage. 
</P>
<P>
"They appreciate a lot that we just take for granted," Ward said, as a child 
trying to reach the front of the boat crowded past him. "They enjoy the boat 
moving, the islands and everything they see." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the children used binoculars to get a closer look at everything from 
the pelicans that bobbed in the dark, gray sea to sea lions vying for a sunny 
spot on a buoy. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Pinentel, 8, proved himself invaluable by judging and sampling the 
ocean's wettest waves. 
</P>
<P>
Leaning over the starboard railing, Carlos alerted his friends to the biggest 
waves so they could gather at the edge before the water smacked the front of 
the boat and sprayed them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just perfect," he said, wearing an impish grin despite the water that 
dripped from his hair down his face and onto his sodden black ski jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in waves gave way to whales when a plane spotted two California gray 
whales about two miles from shore and alerted the boat's captain. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the blue and white, 65-foot, twin-diesel boat was trailing two juvenile 
whales, between 25 and 35 feet long and about 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The whales meandered along, periodically showing the excited sightseers a flash 
of dark brown back or a small spout of water from their blowholes. 
</P>
<P>
The children also tracked the whales by their footprints -- smooth patches of 
water created when the whales swim close to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's whale-watching season lasts from December through April, when 
regularly scheduled boats allow viewers to catch the overlapping northward and 
southward migrations of California gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
The whales head south in October when the Arctic feeding ground that supplies 
them with the small, shrimp-like creature they crave is covered by ice. 
</P>
<P>
Their final destination, 6,000 miles away, is the Baja Peninsula, where 
pregnant females give birth to their calves. 
</P>
<P>
By February, the calves manage to develop a layer of blubber that will help 
shield them from the cold, and the whales begin their northern trek. 
</P>
<P>
The journey, which takes about three months each way, is one of the longest 
migrations of any mammal. 
</P>
<P>
Whale-watchers are apt to spot many whale varieties, ranging from orcas to 
humpbacks, in the channel. But it is the California gray whale that is the 
stock of Ventura's whale-watching trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The gray whales you can bank on," said Shaun Akers, who works as a crew member 
on many whale-watching expeditions. "You can set your watch on them." 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson's students spent an entire day learning all they could about the 
whales. They also talked about how to prevent seasickness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But no amount of education helps if your sea legs are wobbly. At least five 
children got sick, and possibly the biggest excitement of the day came when one 
student observed that Mortenson was a little under the weather herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess what, everybody," one third-grader said. "Mrs. Mortenson threw up." 
</P>

PLAN TO LIMIT DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude has introduced a measure to the City 
Council that would preserve the small-shop character of the Brentwood Village 
commercial area at Sunset Boulevard and Barrington Avenue by cutting the legal 
density in half. 
</P>
<P>
Braude aide Cindy Miscikowski said the proposal is designed to prevent 
large-scale development in the area, but she added that "there is no pressing 
development we're trying to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Under existing zoning regulations for the 3.6-acre business district, the 
maximum allowable square footage for a commercial building is 1 1/2 times the 
square footage of the lot. Braude's proposal would set the maximum at 75% of 
the square footage of the lot. It will take about a year for the proposal to 
wend its way through the city legislative process, Miscikowski said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure was enacted recently to protect the Brentwood Country Mart 
area at 26th Street and San Vicente Boulevard.

WAITING PERIOD FOR RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who buy rifles in Santa Monica will have to wait 15 days to take 
delivery of their weapons starting next year, under a law adopted by the City 
Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
Because state law prohibits municipalities from imposing waiting periods on gun 
purchasers for the purpose of making background checks on them, the new Santa 
Monica law defines the 15-day wait as a cooling-off period in which no 
background checks will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed the effective date of the law to next Jan. 1 on the advice 
of City Atty. Robert Myers, who said it gives time to state legislators to 
adopt similar, overriding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Local gun shop owners doubted the effectiveness of such a plan. Judson 
Swearingen, owner of Cole's Guns, said the law would "divert the legitimate 
purchases by Santa Monica residents to stores outside this city." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman David Finkel said the waiting period would "advance the dialogue 
(on gun control). If it does nothing more than that, then it's still a good 
idea," he said.

VENTURA MOVES TO TAKE OVER 118-YEAR-OLD PIER, PLANS $3.5-MILLION RESTORATION; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: OFFICIALS HOPE TO ADD SHOPS AND CONCESSIONS TO ATTRACT ENOUGH 
TOURISTS TO MAKE THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE SELF-SUFFICIENT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years after the Ventura pier was ripped by a winter storm, city officials 
moved this week to save the historic structure from further destruction despite 
uncertainty over who will pay to keep it in good repair. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members unanimously decided Monday night to take over ownership of 
the 118-year-old pier from the state to begin a $3.5-million overhaul to 
restore it to its 1,985-foot length. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over the historic pier also means inheriting more than $100,000 in 
annual maintenance costs, said Barbara Harison, parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
The city must assume ownership of the pier to receive state grants allocated 
for its restoration, one of which has a June 30 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
While a citizens group gathered more than 15,000 signatures in support of 
restoring the pier, officials said, some restoration supporters did not know 
that taxpayers would have to pay for its maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we had 15,000 signatures in the petition, but I don't think they knew 
it was going to cost them in the long run," Councilman John McWherter said. "It 
could be torn down in the next big storm." 
</P>
<P>
The pier, built in 1872 as a private commercial wharf, has endured frequent 
storm damage in its history. 
</P>
<P>
A 1934 fire charred parts of its landward section. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the city has assumed ownership of the troubled pier. 
The city originally bought the pier in 1940, then sold it to the state in 1949 
because of high maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, further deterioration in the pier, inflation and severe storm damage 
increased restoration costs by about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The state was forced to make $150,000 in repairs to damaged pilings that year. 
</P>
<P>
One key to providing a maintenance budget is to add more concessions when the 
pier is overhauled, Harison said. 
</P>
<P>
Unless concessions are added, the city could end up paying for repairs, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A market study prepared for the city last November indicated that adding 
concessions would help draw enough tourists and new revenue to pay for 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates show 10,000 feet of restaurant space would generate $79,000 the first 
year and $210,000 in the 10th year of lease payments, enough to pay for 
maintenance, Harison said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study noted, improvements could attract tourists to businesses 
in other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that the waterfront area is a lucrative source of revenue for 
city businesses, even though they are not on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors spent nearly $25 million at Ventura's restaurants in 1988 and could 
spend more if other concessions were added to the pier, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's three restaurant and retail stores at the pier generate enough 
business to make it the state's 10th largest money-making concession, said 
Steve Treanor, state park district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
State officials receive $50,000 to $60,000 in lease payments each year from 
Sandy Hedrick, the concessionaire who operates the Pier Fish House Restaurant 
as well as a small bait and tackle store and a snack shop. 
</P>
<P>
Hedrick, one of the main organizers of the citizens drive to restore the pier 
after it was damaged in the 1986 storm, said the pier could support increased 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen steady growth every year we've been there," Hedrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Although businesses have not been asked to bid for concessions at the pier 
project, there is keen interest in it, said Jim Barroca, chamber of commerce 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would argue in favor of nostalgia. I'd say, add a little gift shop 
or two," Barroca said. "I think it would be very nice, there's a lot of people 
who don't fish, who just want to stroll."

THEATER PROPOSAL CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted this week to remove a Spanish-language theater from a 
planned development of a city-owned parking lot on 2nd Street in downtown Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
After city staff members said the theater would add $660,000 to the 
construction cost of the mixed-use project, the council voted 4 to 2 to replace 
it with a Latino cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
The development will also include residential units and ground-floor commercial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
In its recommendation, the city staff noted that removing the theater would 
permit the city to increase the number of residential units in the development 
from 28 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents had lobbied vigorously for a Spanish-language theater to replace 
the privately owned Cine Latino, which operated for many years on 3rd Street 
before closing in 1987.

RESIDENTS SEEK TO CUT DRUG DEALING ON EUCALYPTUS AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bellflower residents and city officials will meet tonight to discuss ways to 
combat drug trafficking on Eucalyptus Avenue by limiting traffic flow along the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is set for 5:30 p.m. at Bellflower City Hall, 16600 Civic Center 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Residents for months have been complaining about drug trafficking in the area 
of Eucalyptus Avenue and Alondra Boulevard. At last week's City Council 
meeting, they asked the council to consider installing a cul-de-sac at the 
north, south or center of Eucalyptus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
City staff has recommended eliminating southbound traffic on Eucalyptus Avenue 
from Alondra Boulevard by setting up barricades.

TEACHERS CALL FOR SANCTIONS IN YEAR-OLD CONTRACT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers in the Compton Unified School District have asked the California 
Teachers Assn. to sanction the district for what the teachers say is a refusal 
to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to negotiate a contract with this district since last 
February," said Muriel Brooks, president of the Compton Education Assn., which 
represents the district's 1,085 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the district asked for a state fact-finder, a move teachers 
branded as stalling because the fact-finding report will not be ready for a 
month. Sanctions, Brooks suggested, could include a plea to university job 
placement bureaus not to refer new teachers to Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The CTA executive board is scheduled to take up the sanction request at its 
two-day meeting that begins today. However, CTA dropped sanctions from its 
bylaws a decade ago and CTA President Ed Foglia said he did not know what 
action the board would take. 
</P>
<P>
The request, Foglia said, "points out more than anything that there's a real 
chronic problem we've had in Compton in labor relations and we think it affects 
the school program."

NEW FIRM HIRES LAID-OFF CITY STAFF, RESUMES TAPINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compton residents can continue viewing weekly City Council meetings on cable 
television now that the council has voted to contract with its former video 
production employees. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, in the face of continuing budget problems, the council 
eliminated the Community Communications Network and Public Affairs Department, 
adding at least six more city employees to the approximately 85 laid off last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charles Thrower, who directed the city-owned network, formed a private 
production company that he calls Thrower Video Enterprises and proposed that 
the city hire his firm to videotape the council meetings, which are broadcast 
on Channel 36 on Mondays and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Thrower has hired three laid-off network employees, and will use city equipment 
for the tapings. The cost to the city is $45,500 for the rest of the fiscal 
year ending June 30.

CHANGE IN TAX PLAN SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents and other residents Tuesday night suggested to the Beverly Hills school 
board ways to sell voters a proposed parcel tax to help shore up the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The tax measure, which will be on the June 5 ballot, must be approved by 
two-thirds of the voters to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The school board has drafted a tiered assessment system in which properties 
would be taxed $350 to $750 a year, depending on their size and use. The 
measure would raise about $4.5 million a year for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Harris, speaking on behalf of Children First, a parents group, 
recommended that the varying tax rates have what he termed a "more equitable 
spread." The group suggested, for instance, that single-family homes on parcels 
less than 9,999 square feet be taxed $300 a year, instead of the $350 proposed 
by the board. For single-family homes on larger parcels, it suggested rates of 
$600 and $800 instead of the $500 and $650 in the board's version. 
</P>
<P>
"We've discussed it with many senior citizens," Harris said. "We think a little 
more spread would be more palatable." 
</P>
<P>
Children First's plan would raise about $4.8 million a year, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
The group and individual parents also suggested changes in wording of the 
ballot question and the board's official resolution calling for the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Dave Gordon warned the board of a silent opposition that helped defeat 
the district's last parcel-tax attempt in 1987. When he walked door-to-door in 
support of that measure, he said, "motherhood, flags, the schools -- everyone 
was in favor. But they didn't vote that way." 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they will review the recommendations and adopt a final 
version today. "We want to make this as palatable as possible," said Frank 
Fenton, board president.

<P>
UNIONS CONSIDER MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Federation of Teachers has offered to merge with the Culver 
City Teachers Assn., a rival union that displaced the federation in 1988 as the 
teachers' bargaining agent with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers "are sick of the infighting," said federation President David Mielke. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a lot of time hammering each other instead of working together for 
better working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 275 teachers, nurses, librarians and counselors in Culver 
City schools belong to the teachers association, according to its president, 
Bess Doerr. Mielke said his union has about 70 members. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr agreed that teachers want unity and said a merger would increase the 
teachers' bargaining power with the school district. However, she criticized 
Mielke for having urged rejection of the contract that the teachers association 
negotiated with the district in November. The federation, she said, "tore 
things apart when we needed support." The teachers ultimately ratified the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Mielke said his offer is prompted by the merger in October of the two teachers 
unions in San Francisco. One union is affiliated with the California Teachers 
Assn. and one with the California Federation of Teachers, as is the case in 
Culver City. The teachers in San Francisco belong to the one merged local and 
then to both of the separate state groups, which split the dues, Mielke and 
Doerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said she will discuss the merger idea with the association's parent 
group, the California Teachers Assn.

SANTA MONICA COUNCIL OKS $41,000 FOR NEEDY; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: THE STOPGAP MEASURE BARELY SQUEAKS BY. IT IS CRITICIZED AS BOTH NOT 
ENOUGH AND TOO MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a six-month study of the homeless in Santa Monica, the City Council on 
Tuesday adopted what amounted to a $41,000 stopgap measure to deal with some 
aspects of the increasingly controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
In a stormy session Tuesday night, the council squeezed through the measure on 
a 4-0 vote -- the minimum number of yes votes needed for passage. Councilman 
Herb Katz was absent, and Councilman William H. Jennings and Councilwoman 
Christine Reed left just before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions adopted are hotel vouchers for disabled homeless who have 
difficulty getting to other shelters, increased policing of liquor stores, the 
establishment of an advisory group of homeless people and the creation of a 
task force to study the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff also recommended that the city adopt more substantial programs, 
such as creating more homeless shelters, policing parks, and providing more 
health and social services for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are disappointed that (the adopted plan) doesn't offer a major 
structure, but we have to be realistic," said Barbara Stinchfield, the city's 
community development manager. 
</P>
<P>
While some council members were concerned that the measure did not reach far 
enough, others said it went too far. Councilwoman Christine Reed walked out of 
the meeting and denied the council the fifth vote needed to fund the measure 
under the normal budget procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk in Palisades Park five days a week, and I see (homeless) people 
urinating over the bluffs," Reed said during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Jennings also found fault with the plan, saying that it 
discourages productivity among the homeless. "You're letting people just sit 
around, and that doesn't strike me as accomplishing anything that is useful," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings also ended up leaving before the vote, prompting the remaining four 
members to circumvent the five-vote requirement by approving the funds from a 
different budget category requiring only four votes for approval. City Atty. 
Robert M. Myers stepped in to voice support by donating $5,000 from the city 
attorney's fund to help establish the homeless coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the council's approval of the measures, some homeless advocates said 
the plan still fell short. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a strong belief that we can do a lot better," said Robert Segal, 
chairman of the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce homeless task force. "(The 
plan) feels kind of like a box of Band-Aids." 
</P>
<P>
The plan will add $41,000 to $1.2 million already budgeted by the city for 
homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
Contingent on additional funds becoming available throughout the year, the city 
staff also proposed that the city continue to support the Regional Emergency 
Cold Weather Shelter Program, which makes shelter available to all homeless 
people when temperatures drop below 40 degrees, and adding four new park 
rangers to patrol city parks frequented by the homeless, which would cost 
$220,000.

CSU WANTS REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arguments regarding a university at Taylor Ranch have left out the most 
important discussion of all: Why do they need 465 acres? When you consider the 
very small area that Yale covers, that Annapolis covers only 338 acres (and 
that includes a huge football field and stadium, a large cemetery, Dewey Field 
and Woren Field, besides a large basin for its training ships, plus student 
buildings and housing) you just have to wonder, why so much land for Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
I think the answer can be found in the Wall Street Journal of Jan. 3. An 
article tells how the universities in many states "are going into the real 
estate business to make money." The University of Virginia is building a 
102,000-square-foot building for the headquarters for the State Alcohol 
Beverage Control Board on university land. One of the county supervisors 
complains that, "What they want to do violates county zoning and master plans. 
Private developers couldn't get away with it, but they can because as a state 
agency they are exempt from local regulation". In Washington, D.C., the 
university has become known as the "Real Estate University." Stanford operates 
a 71-acre shopping center; University of Miami, a marina; University of 
Washington at Seattle, two parking garages and six office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Has this happened with CSU? Yes, it has. This same university at one time owned 
about 400 acres near Somis. The land was bounded on the south by California 
118, on the west by Price Road, on the east by Aggen Road and on the north by 
La Loma Avenue. Under the Brown Administration, the state needed money so asked 
for "surplus" land from all the agencies that was not using the land, in order 
to sell it. Since CSU had not built yet, the land was sold in 1979 to 
developers. Will the state do this to Taylor Ranch?

NOLAN TO SEEK 7TH ASSEMBLY TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R -- Glendale) announced Monday that he will run for a 
seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan has served as representative from the 41st Assembly District since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in Glendale with his wife, Gail, and two children. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's political future has been uncertain since he and other state 
legislators were targets of an FBI sting operation in August, 1988, that was 
based on allegations of corruption in the Legislature. Nolan has not been 
charged with any crime, but he later resigned his post as Assembly minority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his candidacy, Nolan said he will continue his efforts to hold 
down taxes and spending, to improve public education and to enact tougher crime 
laws. He said he has worked closely with Gov. George Deukmejian to re-implement 
the death penalty in the state.

RADIO DEVICES TO HELP POLICE TRACK STOLEN CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happens all the time, police say. A shopper finds a space, parks the car, 
heads for the store. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be just a few minutes inside the shopping center, the car is 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Auto theft in Los Angeles County has increased 34% since 1984, the California 
Highway Patrol said. In the San Gabriel Valley, it has jumped 96% since 1984, 
according to FBI crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
To stop the auto thefts, Los Angeles County has begun installing a high-tech 
homing device network designed to help police track down stolen vehicles. In 
the San Gabriel Valley, the Azusa Police Department is the first to have the 
device installed in one of its patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
"This will definitely save a lot of time and increase the rate of recovery for 
stolen vehicles," said Azusa Police Chief Lloyd Wood. The Azusa City Council 
recently approved funding for three more tracking units, which cost $1,800 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"To watch it work is absolutely incredible," said Councilman Harry Stemrich. 
"It is revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
The system, manufactured by Massachusetts-based LoJack Corp., looks like 
something out of a James Bond movie. It has two parts, one for individual cars, 
which will be available through auto dealerships, and one for police cars, 
provided by LoJack. 
</P>
<P>
In individual cars, a small radio device about the size of a chalkboard eraser, 
powered by the car battery, is hidden in one of 30 places around a car. Each 
homing device has a five-digit code paired with the car's vehicle 
identification number in the state police crime computer. Once a report for a 
stolen car is filed, police will enter the five-digit code into the computer, 
which will automatically go over a network of radio transmitters throughout Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Patrolling police cars equipped with the LoJack tracking computers, will 
receive the broadcast of the LoJack unit in the stolen car, and zero in on it. 
Los Angeles County, which in 1988 reported 114,785 stolen vehicles, signed a 
five-year contract with LoJack in March, 1988, said Terry Solay, LoJack general 
manager for California operations. The LAPD, the Sheriff's Department, the 
California Highway Patrol and the other 46 police stations in the county are 
scheduled to receive one complimentary tracking computer from LoJack. 
</P>
<P>
Homing devices for individual cars are scheduled to be on the market June 1 and 
will cost about $600. 
</P>
<P>
Individual police stations throughout the county are either installing or 
awaiting installation of the units in their patrol cars. The LAPD now has 18 
patrol cars equipped with the LoJack system, the most of any department in the 
county, said Sgt. Jeff Hulet, project director for the LAPD stolen vehicle 
recovery network. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack introduced the tracking device in Massachusetts more than three years 
ago. Now, 125 state police and 200 local police vehicles there are equipped 
with LoJack. It has received favorable reviews from both police and consumers. 
And, according to police statistics, 95% of stolen cars with the LoJack were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Tauer, of Framingham, Mass., on the outskirts of the Boston 
metropolitan area, says the LoJack saved her new car. Tauer had just bought the 
car when it was stolen from the parking lot of a shopping mall where she worked 
part time. She called the police at 9:30 p.m.; seven minutes later, her car was 
found in South Boston. The only damage was a popped ignition and few scratches. 
</P>
<P>
"I had searched for this car for over two months . . . it was my dream car," 
Tauer said. "When they (police) called me and told me they found it, I rushed 
right over to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles County are hoping to duplicate the results of 
Massachusetts. In that state, the rates of stolen vehicle recoveries and car 
theft arrests have risen, and there has been a decrease in the number of cars 
ending up in "chop-shops," where they are disassembled and sold as parts, Baran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the time to recover a stolen car is very lengthy, taking days or 
weeks, the LAPD's Hulet said. "But in Massachusetts they are averaging 90 
minutes to recover a car. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, looking at Massachusetts, we can project that we will have a 25 to 30% 
arrest rate," Hulet added -- better than the 1% arrest rate Los Angeles has 
now.

PRAISE FOR 'A COMMUNITY THAT WORKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago I noticed a hillside area near my house which was being used, 
I guessed, as a "turn-out" for viewing the city below by people who had an 
obvious, blatant disregard for the city litter laws. I also noticed several 
retaining walls along the road that had been "tagged" with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, I called my Neighborhood Watch adviser at the Police Department, 
and she assured me that patrols in the area could and would be increased, 
especially at night, and she thanked me for calling because the information I 
had given her helps the department be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
I then called the Glendale Beautification number and spoke with the person in 
charge of "Knock-Out-Graffiti," who arranged to have the retaining walls 
cleaned. Within a week the graffiti was completely erased. 
</P>
<P>
I just wanted to say thank you to the representatives and employees of the city 
of Glendale. It is a pleasure to live in a community that works!

DRILLING NEW WATER WELLS PROHIBITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With new evidence that seawater has breached the county's largest underground 
source of fresh water, officials have enacted an emergency ban to prohibit new 
wells on the Oxnard Plain and proposed a permanent ordinance to reduce water 
consumption there by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Tests in November warned growers and the four cities that depend on the ground 
water that the county's deepest underground pools might have been contaminated 
with seawater. Results from the U.S. Geological Survey announced Friday 
confirmed those suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is almost no doubt that this is lateral seawater intrusion," county 
hydrologist John Turner told the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency on 
Friday. The public agency regulates ground water usage on the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency measure, which expires in six months, permits water users to 
replace wells as they go dry or break down, but prohibits new wells. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a moratorium," said grower Lynn Maulhardt, chairman of the 
Groundwater Agency board. But, he added, it does prohibit growers from 
irrigating new farmland that has not previously used county water. 
</P>
<P>
Seawater contamination can make water unsuitable for crops or municipal use, 
water experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Growers who packed the board hearing room last week sat quietly as the 
emergency ban was discussed. Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura 
County Farm Bureau, said the growers understand the need for the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a finite water capacity," Laird said. "The issue is going to have to 
be addressed whether we like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Only one person, representing an industry association of well drillers, pump 
contractors and engineers, spoke in opposition to the emergency ban. Larry 
Rottman of the California Groundwater Assn. threatened to sue the board if it 
passed the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the agency passed the measure 5 to 0 and instructed its staff to 
prepare a permanent ordinance to replace the temporary measure when it expires. 
</P>
<P>
The county's deep ground water system, which includes the large Fox Canyon 
Aquifer, was previously believed to have remained pure despite six decades of 
pumping more water than rainfall could replenish. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have known since the 1920s that overdrafting allowed the gradual 
encroachment of seawater into the more shallow aquifers. But over the past 
several years the 800 water users on the Oxnard Plain, including the cities of 
Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Camarillo, dug their wells deeper to find 
fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
Deeper wells and the past three years of drought have strained the lower ground 
water system, a series of deep freshwater pools, and allowed the seawater to 
move in, Turner explained. 
</P>
<P>
Those wells pump about 150,000 acre-feet of water per year out of the Oxnard 
Plain, Turner said. The ban would prohibit pumping to irrigate the 3,700 acres 
of agricultural land in the area that currently is not irrigated. Turner 
estimates it would take a maximum of 10,000 acre feet of water annually to 
irrigate that land. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinance to reduce pumping 25% by 2010 will affect far more growers and 
water users than the emergency ban, officials said. That ordinance calls for 
the first 5% cut in consumption by 1992, with 5% decreases every five years 
until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, according to officials, the lower ground water system should 
reach the point at which water draining into the underground pools is equal to 
or more than the quantity being pumped out. That point is called safe yield. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance uses historical records on water use to determine individual 
water allocations. If growers already are using water efficiently, and can 
prove that they use less water than other growers with similar crops, their 
allocations can be adjusted, according to the ordinance. Fines would be 
assessed ranging from $50 to $200 per acre foot above allocations. 
</P>
<P>
The next public hearing on the ordinance is planned for Feb. 23 in the county 
Board of Supervisors Hearing Room. Officials hope to have the ordinance adopted 
and in place by late spring.

DALTON SHINES IN GLENDALE'S SEASON OF GLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale High girls' basketball team might be in the process of rebuilding, 
but sophomore Jenny Dalton continues to play like an experienced veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, 5-foot-8, is the only returning starter from last year's team that was 
18-6 overall, 7-3 in Pacific League play and made it to the second round of the 
Southern Section playoffs before losing to Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Glendale is 6-11 and 1-6. The Dynamiters start two sophomores and 
three freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton averaged eight points and 10 assists as a guard in 1989. This season she 
has played guard, forward and center and is averaging 16 points and 16 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been our whole offense," Glendale Coach Paul Broneer said. "With the 
experience the other players are getting this season, we should be right there 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Future shock: Crescenta Valley is another girls' team waiting for next year. 
</P>
<P>
With three games left, including today's game against powerful Pasadena, the 
Falcons are 0-17 overall and 0-7 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Scott Sisson said his players are still goal-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat down last week and decided the big future goal is just to win a game so 
there is a bright note at the end of the rainbow," Sisson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons will get their chance next week when they conclude their schedule 
with Glendale and Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Winnin' times: While its girls' team struggles, the Crescenta Valley boys' 
varsity is rolling along as usual. 
</P>
<P>
When the Falcons defeated Arcadia on Jan. 19, they assured themselves of the 
27th winning season in the school's 28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley's only losing season was in 1982, when the Falcons finished 
9-14. 
</P>
<P>
John Goffredo, in his 12th season, and Ed Goorjian are the only coaches the 
school has had. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley (13-7, 5-2 in Pacific League play) meets league-leading 
Pasadena (7-0) tonight at home. 
</P>
<P>
Heading for a title: The La Canada High boys' soccer team, 15-1-1 overall and 
6-0 in Rio Hondo League play, is on track to repeat as champion of the Southern 
Section 1-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, under co-coaches Louie Bilowitz and Afshin Ghotbi, lost 12 
seniors from last year's team, including David Quesada, the 1-A Offensive 
Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada is led by returning All-Southern Section sweeper Ross Allan, who has 
scored 18 goals. 
</P>
<P>
On track: Rick Provenzano of Glendale College qualified for The Times/Eagle 
Indoor Meet on Feb. 16 at the Forum by placing second in the 800 meters last 
Saturday in a meet at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Provenzano's time of 1 minute, 53.55 seconds was just off his personal best 
(1:52.54), set last May at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
By participating in The Times meet, Provenzano will miss Glendale's opener 
against West Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, which is also scheduled for Feb. 
16.

VAQUEROS BRACE FOR MAJOR EARLY-SEASON TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale College baseball team won't have to wait long to look at some of 
the best community college teams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros open their 1990 season Friday by playing host to Riverside in the 
first round of the Foothill Tournament. The eight-team, double-elimination 
event, co-sponsored by Glendale and Citrus colleges, also includes defending 
state champion Cerritos, El Camino, Ventura, College of the Canyons and Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is coming off a 1989 season in which the Vaqueros finished 16-20 
overall and 8-12 in Western State Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Coach Steve Coots, in his 12th season with the Vaqueros, has a veteran 
team led by center fielder John Bojanac, first baseman Art Chute and third 
baseman Paul Hugasian. 
</P>
<P>
Bojanac and Chute were selected first-team All-WSC last season. Hugasian, a 
shortstop last season, was named to the All-WSC second team. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores Aldo Angrisani and Darron McWhorter will start at catcher and second 
base, respectively, and freshman Swain Wukelich replaces Hugasian at short. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Vic Ramirez and Dustin Pike will flank Bojanac in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we've shown signs of brilliance, but we've also been 
inconsistent," Coots said. "We're not quite where I hoped we'd be on offense, 
but I think we'll get there." 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros' experience should pay off most in the performance of their 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The sophomores have done a good job of setting the tone," Coots said. "The 
pitchers are farther along then we've been at this time in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Mike Larsen, who was second-team All-WSC last season, 
opens as the staff ace. Sophomore right-handers Mike Peterson and Jaime Aguayo 
also threw well in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Whisenant, a freshman left-hander from La Canada High who was drafted last 
June by the Philadelphia Phillies, is the brightest newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-handers Steve Dempsey and Brad Blackmore will also see action.

VETERAN TEAM LOOKS LIKE A TITLE

<P>
They are teams of similar experience and, Coach Jeff Henderson hopes, similar 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental College baseball team begins the 1990 season Saturday at 
Westmont with more veteran players than any Tiger club since 1982 -- the year 
Occidental won its last Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, in his fifth season as Occidental's coach, was a second baseman for 
the 1982 champions. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of four-year starters that year and this year we do too," 
Henderson said. "There's a camaraderie that develops with a group like that. 
They've been together a long time working hard toward a goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The SCIAC title is a realistic goal for us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have every player back from a team that finished 22-17 overall and 
10-8 in the SCIAC last season. Among them are pitcher Dave Stoll and infielder 
Tom Bonetto, both of whom were selected first team all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound sophomore left-hander, was 8-3 with a 3.39 
earned-run average as a freshman and led the conference with 82 strikeouts in 
85 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bonetto, a senior who is a four-year starter, led the conference in batting 
last season with a .434 average and was selected second-team All-American. This 
season, he moves from second base to third to make way for junior Mark Dalton 
(.207) 
</P>
<P>
Other veterans include junior shortstop Mark Harris (.370), sophomore first 
baseman Mike Bonetto (.354 and a conference-leading 10 home runs) and senior 
catcher Mike Knisely (.314). All three players were second-team all-conference 
selections in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals in the off-season was to strengthen the pitching staff 
through recruiting," Henderson said, "and I think we were successful." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Mather, a freshman right-hander from Corona del Mar, and junior 
right-hander Mark Teitelman, a transfer from Johns Hopkins, are expected to 
have the greatest impact. They join senior right-handers Rob Drew and Isidro 
Rodriguez and junior right-hander Jason Rusk.

ON THE REBOUND; 
</P>
<P>
JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFER KEVIN CUTLER IS FINDING HIS NICHE WITH 49ERS, AVERAGING 
7 REBOUNDS AND 11 POINTS A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The view from the motel room window in Logan, Utah, held snow-covered 
mountains, but Kevin Cutler, a Cal State Long Beach basketball player, looked 
toward a TV that showed the Flintstones. 
</P>
<P>
"I like cartoons," he said, resting his 6-foot-8, 220-pound frame on a bed. 
</P>
<P>
It was mid-afternoon last Thursday, four hours before the 49ers would play Utah 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the snow with a passion," said Cutler, a 21-year-old junior forward who 
grew up in Pomona. "I like shorts and tank tops." 
</P>
<P>
So he was trying to endure the cold first leg of a five-day, two-game trip that 
would conclude in San Jose. The 49ers had flown to Salt Lake City late 
Wednesday and spent the night there. They rode a bus 84 miles to Logan on 
Thursday morning, checked into the motel, then went to the Spectrum for a noon 
practice. At 3:30 p.m. they would eat at an Italian restaurant. Then they would 
wait to go to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler is adjusting to this regimented life and the tough competition of 
Division I basketball after transferring a year ago from Arizona Western 
College, where he averaged 17 points and 14 rebounds and was a junior college 
all-American. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season with the 49ers, he is leading the team in rebounds with an 
average of seven a game, and is second in scoring with an 11-point average. 
</P>
<P>
With his short haircut, thin mustache and powerful-looking upper body, Cutler 
resembles a younger, shorter Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had broad shoulders," Cutler said. "I never worked out (with weights) 
till I got to Long Beach. People thought I played football. I couldn't stand 
football." 
</P>
<P>
He played football, briefly as a sophomore, at Ganesha High School in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I got crunched," he said, laughing. "In practice my teammates blitzed me 
and hit me just as I was throwing the ball. I took the pads off and walked off 
the field." 
</P>
<P>
Cutler can loom as a man among boys on the court, when he leaps with a long arm 
extended to grab a one-handed rebound, or when he rushes to the offensive 
backboard to dunk after grabbing a teammate's missed shot. Coaches like to call 
these "big-time" plays. 
</P>
<P>
"In junior college, it was kind of easy," said Cutler, who likes to shoot a 
soft jumper and a half-hook. "I usually would be going up against a guy 6-6. 
Now, every night I have to go out and pick myself up because other teams have 
guys who may be taller or a little stronger than me." 
</P>
<P>
He has had to adjust in other ways, too. In junior college, he said there were 
no long trips, on which studying was required. "It's strictly business here," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After transferring, Cutler went almost a year without playing. When he began 
practicing with the team 13 months ago, he was overweight. 
</P>
<P>
"He could hardly make a move inside," Coach Joe Harrington recalled. 
</P>
<P>
An All-CIF player at Ganesha High, Cutler was recruited by Cal State Fullerton 
but did not meet the academic requirements under the NCAA's Prop. 48. Now, as a 
criminal justice major, he recorded a 3.0 grade-point average last semester, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He spent two seasons at Arizona Western in Yuma, where he enjoyed celebrity 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an older crowd there," Cutler said. "They like basketball, they make 
you feel like a professional athlete. They have a TV station in Yuma. To see 
yourself on TV a lot made you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Cutler would like to play in the NBA. "Coach Harrington says I have a chance," 
Cutler said. "But if I don't make it, I won't be committing suicide." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was mistaken for a pro player the day before at the airport. "A guy 
came up to me and said, 'Where's Patrick Ewing and the other guys?' I told him 
I don't play for the Knicks." The New York Knicks had arrived in Salt Lake City 
the same day for a game with the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Although he looks menacing on the court, Cutler is pleasant, outgoing and 
upbeat off it. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington remembers watching Cutler in a game at Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
"He got the whole crowd fired up, he was running around, slapping hands with 
the fans." Harrington said. "He's totally positive. He's serious about being 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Cutler's main problem, however, other than occasionally missing easy shots, has 
been a tendency to get in foul trouble. As a result, his playing time has been 
curtailed drastically in recent games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I foul," he said. "It's frustrating. All you can be is a 
cheerleader when you're sitting on the side." 
</P>
<P>
Seth Greenberg, Harrington's assistant, believes Cutler is called for so many 
fouls because of his physical stature and aggressiveness. "His arms are so long 
that they create like a visual illusion and the refs (believe) that his blocks 
can't be clean," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg recruited Cutler at Arizona Western. "He's a perfect example of our 
recruiting philosophy," Greenberg said. "We stopped recruiting him and we 
befriended him. I think he trusted us." 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be interested in me more as a person than just as a player," said 
Cutler, who was also recruited by Oklahoma. "He seemed to care more. He 
promised my Mom I would graduate. I'll graduate (a year from) May." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said he is confident his promise will be fulfilled because: "We put 
him in an environment where education is important, where we know his every 
move academically." 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Mitchell, the 49ers' senior guard, has had a big influence on Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
"He's competitive on and off the court, and that's carried over to me," Cutler 
said of Mitchell. "I was upset because I had a 3.0 (GPA). I thought I should 
have closed the gap more than that." 
</P>
<P>
That night, in a 79-78 Long Beach victory, Cutler got into foul trouble again 
and played only 12 minutes. That upset him more than the cold air outside did. 
</P>
<P>
But the next morning, his optimism had returned. He was on the way to San Jose, 
where a new game and warmer weather awaited.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PALKIE HELPS KEEP BUENA ROLLING SMOOTHLY AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A young woman doesn't so much play basketball at Buena High as fit in. But if 
the fit is right, she will find herself playing at a level she may never have 
dreamed possible. 
</P>
<P>
Buena players figure that as long as no one stands out, no one stands to lose. 
</P>
<P>
It's a belief instilled by Coach Joe Vaughan, who has directed the Bulldogs to 
the Channel League title 11 times -- and the state title twice -- in the past 
13 years. This year is no different: The scoring and rebounding are spread as 
evenly as lawn seed and the team has mowed down every opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Typifying the selflessness, yet finding room to grow as an individual, is Mia 
Palkie, a junior forward. In three games last week, including two against 
Buena's toughest Channel League foes, Palkie scored a team-high 37 points. 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly a good night's work for the likes of Michelle Palmisano of 
Thousand Oaks or Nichole Victoria of Camarillo. But who is the most valuable 
cog on a team boasting a record of 19-0 entering the week?

"Mia should become a major college player," Vaughan said. "She has a 
well-rounded game. Besides scoring and rebounding, she is a key force in our 
pressing situations." 
</P>
<P>
Palkie, 5-foot-8, is just now understanding how good she can become, Vaughan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She plays like a boy the way she attacks the basket and drives for layups," he 
said. "She'll keep getting better. Mia is a player who doesn't realize her 
potential yet." 
</P>
<P>
Palkie did realize the value of fitting into Vaughan's system, however, and 
that will enhance the growth of her individual skills as well as increase her 
chances of playing for a Southern Section championship.

BLACK SEA BASS NUMBERS SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hopes for black sea bass are rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile giant black sea bass are making appearances again. 
</P>
<P>
The fish were in danger of extinction until the state Department of Fish and 
Game put them on the prohibited keeper list in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Not a day passes but that someone on a party boat catches a bass and releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When these fish come to the surface in a bloated condition and are unable to 
submerge, there is a safe method to deflate them. The fish suffer from bloating 
of the gas bladder. Fish and Game personnel have deflated bloated rockfish 
successfully during tag and release programs. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on private boats who hook black sea bass can penetrate the skin just 
behind the pectoral fin with a thin blade. The gas will be removed and the fish 
can submerge unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
These fish can grow to 500 pounds and live 70 years if they can evade a hook. 
</P>
<P>
There could be a full return to fishing these giants if the small ones are 
returned to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gregory of Fish and Game said fishermen should remember the survival of 
the sea bass or any undersized fish is an important factor to the fishing of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club held its 16th annual awards banquet Saturday night. 
A club record was set in 1989 when club anglers caught 40 marlin, releasing and 
tagging 28. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy winners were Jerry Austin for largest marlin, Ray Hawkes for first 
albacore and Stan Austin for junior-member award. 
</P>
<P>
A special award went to Syd Whitaker for catching a 6-pound, 4-ounce halibut 
using two-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Klein, 31, the 1989 bass angler of the year, has won $300,000 fishing for 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, from Montgomery, Tex., has been called the "Fishing Professor" because 
of his analytical approach to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
While most anglers have a special technique -- spinner baits, flippin, etc. -- 
Klein has adapted a number of techniques into his game plan. He has gained a 
reputation as a proponent of flippin. He has proven he can catch bass on deep, 
clear lakes as well using plastic worms and grubs as part of his arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a "bassmaster" finalist seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Klein will be sharing techniques with participants in a bass institute at El 
Camino College on Saturday and Sunday. For reservations and information call 
(213) 715-3116. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Bob Walford of Torrance, fishing aboard the Blackjack at 
Cherry Bank, caught the whopper of the week, a 28-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Burke of Long Beach, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal, 
caught a 19 1/2-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lewis of West Los Angeles, aboard the Freedom, won the jackpot with a 
15-pound sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Ladoman of West Los Angeles, fishing on the Monte Carlo for calico bass,

</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Only a few bass and bonito have been caught locally as most boats 
are concentrating on shallow rock cod fishing. 
</P>
<P>

NO LOVE FOR SCHOOL, PREP STAR WILL STUDY ON COURT; 
</P>
<P>
ST. MONICA HIGH'S MICHAEL JOYCE WOULD RATHER BE ON THE PRO TOUR THAN IN THE 
CLASSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spare Michael Joyce the lecture on the benefits of a college education. The 
teachers at St. Monica's High have already tried. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce, a junior, has decided he's not going to college. Probably never will. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like school that much," he said, smiling. "I hate it. I get really 
bored." 
</P>
<P>
Lectures on the benefits of higher education might not inspire the 17-year-old 
from Beverly Hills, but the events of last weekend do. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce advanced to the semifinals of the Adidas Invitational Tennis 
Championships at Indian Wells on Saturday -- further than any other junior in 
the tournament's nine-year history. The event is composed mainly of college 
players who intend to turn pro. The champion wins a wild-card berth in the 
$1-million Newsweek Champions Cup in March. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was another milestone in the rapidly blossoming career of Joyce, 
ranked third in the U.S. Tennis Assn. boys 18-and-under division. He is a 
member of the USTA National Team and plans to travel to Florida in March to 
play in his first series of pro satellite tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, school will fall by the wayside for Joyce. He might not even 
return for his senior year. His father, a film producer who rooms with him 
during most of his tournaments, understands. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired a lot of kids out of USC, UCLA," Michael Sr. said. "A lot of kids went 
a lot further who didn't have educations. If he doesn't make it, he can put a 
tenth of his energy into a film production job and be a success." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by his accomplishments on the court, Joyce might not have to rely on a 
job in his father's industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Joyce, then 16, defeated Michael Flanagan in five sets to win 
the 18's of the Indoor Nationals at Dallas. The victory was particularly sweet 
because Flanagan is a Dallas native, and the 300 fans watching knew it. Joyce 
was an outsider having one of his first experiences with a heavily partisan 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I got a point, it was quiet," Joyce said. "Every time he'd get a 
point, they'd go crazy. It scared me. . . . When I won the match, I heard a few 
claps. Then a few more." 
</P>
<P>
He might have been scared, but he was not rattled. Perhaps that is a 
testimonial to the peculiar coaching techniques of Robert Lansdorp, who has 
been Joyce's mentor for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdorp taught Joyce to weather the elements by insisting that he practice 
outside on teeth-chattering cold days, and windy, rainy days that would shear 
the fuzz off the tennis balls and leave Joyce's spiked, Boris Becker-type red 
hair shellacked to his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the youngster's concentration while hitting ground strokes, 
Lansdorp would rally with Joyce, who counted backward in his head from 100 by 
threes. 
</P>
<P>
The two would play games to 21 points and, without fail, Joyce contends, 
Lansdorp would cheat in the stretch by calling Joyce's close shots out. It was 
another mind-strengthening ploy. It would frustrate Joyce so much that once, 
when he was 12, he rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
"He called the ball out that I thought was in," said Lansdorp, who speaks in a 
thick Dutch accent. "I questioned it and he was rude to me. The tone of his 
voice. I gave him a spanking and said: 'You get the hell out of here, boy.' He 
hated me, he told his father. 
</P>
<P>
"He came back the next time, and we've been good buddies ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce has parlayed that friendship into victories. He has also won a lot of 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Peering intently through a chain-link fence during one of Joyce's preliminary 
matches in Dallas was Pepperdine Coach Allen Fox. Predictably, Joyce was 
dismantling another overmatched foe. 
</P>
<P>
"Within about three shots, I almost fell over I was enjoying it so much," Fox 
said. "I haven't been that impressed with a kid in a long time. He was a 
different animal. 
</P>
<P>
"He was playing quite a good player and utterly dissecting him. Within three or 
four shots off the base line, he'd have the guy all tangled up. Very accurate 
and very cunning." 
</P>
<P>
That strategy has served Joyce well. He often resorted to craftiness and 
precise shot placement as a youth to handle older, stronger competition. At 
5-foot-8 and 135 pounds, he has better luck making an opponent stab in futility 
at a passing shot than burning a string-stinging smash by him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the precision game can be equally nasty. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a surgeon," said Pat Puccinelli, who has tutored Joyce on his serve 
and volley for a year. "He cuts you and watches you bleed. He's just ruthless 
and gets a terrific sense of self-gratification in doing that." 
</P>
<P>
By that description, Joyce sounds less like a surgeon and more like Dr. No -- 
as in, "There is no way I can hold my ground with this 17-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
A sentiment expressed, no doubt, by throngs of frustrated players who have been 
whipped by him. Even adequate training partners are tough to come by for Joyce. 
It's not like he can grab the kid next-door to return a few serves. In fact, he 
rarely uses the court in his back yard. He does have a few partners and 
occasionally will go to a local club and hit with a touring pro making a 
stopover in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce has a rigorous nightly workout regimen that includes three hours of 
tennis and two hours of jogging and weight training. The schedule 
understandably puts a crimp in his social life. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends say: 'You'd rather play tennis than go out?' One day, when I'm 
really good, I'll be going out a lot more than those guys." 
</P>
<P>
That type of determination was apparent early. Once, after a day in 
kindergarten, Joyce returned home distraught. He was left out of a soccer match 
during recess. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned, Jane Joyce tried to soothe her son's bruised ego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK, Mom," Michael said. "I made my own team and beat them all."

FAMILY LIFE: SON'S PLEADINGS FOR A DOG UNLEASH MEMORIES -- AND SKEPTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My 11-year-old is pushing me to get a dog, any kind of dog -- old, young, big, 
little, dumb, smart, he doesn't care, just as long as it can bark and has a 
tail it can wag. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure whether he's been watching too many reruns of "Lassie" or whether 
there isn't a natural need in little boys to have a living creature around that 
enthusiastically endorses any and every scheme that could conceivably pop into 
a kid's mind. 
</P>
<P>
No dog in history has ever mildly questioned, let alone vetoed, an 
11-year-old's idea. I don't care if it's "What do you say we set fire to the 
house?" or "Let's skip the homework and take a run on the beach." Either is 
greeted with jumps and slobbers and much face-licking. 
</P>
<P>
So, realistically, we're not talking about a pet here; we're talking about an 
accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Now, before you rush to get your poison pen and paper, I realize there's a flip 
side. I know the only humans capable of a dog's blind devotion, love and 
loyalty were long ago elevated to sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, saints are a lot cleaner. And don't eat as much. And never have a 
veterinary bill. And never have to be left with friends who don't ever seem 
quite as close after you return from vacation. 
</P>
<P>
I guess what's come over me in this whole matter is a sudden spasm of wisdom, 
the first real understanding I've had of my mother's 
eyes-rolling-upward-into-the-head expression when any of us lucked upon a dog 
in need of a home. 
</P>
<P>
My mother, you see, was never particularly fond of dogs, more of a subscriber 
to James Thurber's belief that the only true dog-lover in the world is one 
hound smitten by another. 
</P>
<P>
She also had the rather odd idea that she would inevitably wind up as the dog's 
sole support, that she would do all the plowing while we reaped all the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Our increasingly busy school-social calendars would leave her the chores of 
feeding and cleaning up after the cur -- and any enmity for missed feedings -- 
while we earned love and loyalty with a few scratches and tossed balls. 
</P>
<P>
So, after the eyes came down from inside the head, she would voice her 
objections to this scraggly creature in a most logical way. 
</P>
<P>
We countered with equal logic. Of course, we'd feed the thing -- all the time. 
Why, we'd delight in keeping the yard clear of certain unmentionable debris. 
No, we'd never let it in the house. 
</P>
<P>
And then the clincher. "Do you want the poor thing to die? You're going to take 
him to the pound and make sure he dies?" Follow those lines with a few tears 
and I guarantee you've got yourself a dog. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, we had a long procession of dogs when I was a kid, some descript, 
some non so descript. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like the one that half killed an intruder when we kids were all at the 
beach for Easter week, she grew to like. Others, like the snarly one she had to 
fight off with the broom in order to hang clothes in the yard, didn't stay long 
on her Christmas list. 
</P>
<P>
The latter one, incidentally, was a jumper and had to be kept on a rope even 
though the back yard had an eight-foot fence. Once, the rope was either a tad 
short or a tad long and my mother answered the door to find a little kid with 
this question: "Lady, did you know your dog is hanging?" 
</P>
<P>
Seems the rope was just long enough to clear the fence but not long enough for 
the dog to touch ground. But the dog survived, leading my mother to state often 
that "you couldn't kill that dog if you tried" -- and leading us to wonder if 
maybe she hadn't tried once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
My habit of choosing, shall we say, peculiar animals continued long after I 
left home. There was the terribly insecure bloodhound (Bones by name) who never 
learned to hike his leg and always squatted like a female and peed on his chin. 
</P>
<P>
We had a two-foot picket fence around the front yard and Bones often fell over 
onto the sidewalk, where he would stand and bay until someone went out and 
opened the gate to let him back in. 
</P>
<P>
About the time we got Bones, Pierre came into our lives. A miniature poodle 
abandoned on the freeway, Pierre was awfully cute but had some bad habits, like 
urinating on the throw rugs. 
</P>
<P>
If we did as the training books said and took a newspaper after Pierre, the 
housebroken Bones would think we were coming after him and take off yelping -- 
and leaving a thin trickle of urine along the hardwood floors. It became easier 
to clean up after Pierre than it was to take the chance of spooking Bones. 
</P>
<P>
I think of Bones and Pierre and the creature that forced my mother to arm 
herself to go into her own back yard when my 11-year-old begins his pleadings 
for a dog. 
</P>
<P>
I stand there as he promises he will be extremely responsible and feed the dog 
every day and make sure it has water and take "really, really good care of it." 
</P>
<P>
And I wonder, as my eyes roll far back into my head: Am I ready for this?

ASK THE VET: DOG THAT DOESN'T EAT MUCH IS MUCH TOO FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. We have a 6-year-old female Schnauzer which has become very overweight. It 
seems that she has gradually gotten fatter without eating too much. We have 
tried to increase her exercise but it doesn't seem to be doing very much good. 
She is still active and does go on walks with us but this doesn't seem to make 
any difference. 
</P>
<P>
She is fed dry food with an occasional can of food added to give it some 
flavor. She gets an occasional treat from us but not every day. I know that 
this isn't good for her and we are going to stop. 
</P>
<P>
What else do you suggest that we do to help her lose all this excess weight? Is 
there a special food that we can feed her or are there any medications like 
diet pills that we can give her? 
</P>
<P>
Carol Yarbor, Cerritos 
</P>
<P>
A. Obesity in our pets is as serious a problem as it is in people. All the 
extra weight puts a strain on the cardiovascular system and increases the 
chance of injury during exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Controlling the food intake as well as regulating the exercise are the major 
ways of reducing your pet's weight problem. You must exhibit some self-control 
in feeding her snacks and treats, especially from the table. 
</P>
<P>
With any proper diet program, you should have your pet throughly examined by 
your veterinarian. It may be necessary to do some blood tests to evaluate your 
pet's organ systems as well as her metabolic status, especially her thyroid 
levels. If she is low on her thyroid levels, your veterinarian will start her 
on medication that she will have to take for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Your veterinarian will set a target weight for her and probably start her on a 
controlled diet program, possibly using a prescription diet such as R/D. This 
should be fed exclusively at a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing your pet every week to two weeks will help monitor her progress. 
Regular exercise will definitely help her achieve her desired weight more 
quickly. You must remember that diet control for your pet will require the 
cooperation of everyone in the family or the plan will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it possible for a neutered male cat to start spraying? Nelson, our 
3-year-old cat, is basically an indoor cat who is allowed to go out every once 
in a while. Over the last several weeks he has started to spray or urinate on 
the rug near the front door. Does he do this because he wants to go outside? He 
has never done this before and has always been a well-behaved cat. What can we 
do to stop this problem? 
</P>
<P>
Karen Meares, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. Spraying is generally a behavioral pattern of a dominant cat and is often 
seen when a new cat or pet is added to the home or if a strange cat starts to 
come into the yard and hang around the windows or doors. Your cat is attempting 
to mark "his" territory and re-establish his dominance. Keeping the stray cat 
away will generally eliminate the cause of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It may be necessary to put your cat on a hormone medication, such as Ovaban, to 
help reduce the behavioral problem. You should also remove the rug, if 
possible, or clean the odor from the area. If it still persists, you might have 
to have Nelson checked out by your veterinarian.

SIGH OF BIPARTISAN RELIEF GREETS BUSH'S PLAN TO TRIM TROOPS; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE QUICK TO HAIL THE PROPOSAL. THEY HAD BEEN 
FEELING POLITICAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE THE DEFENSE BUDGET.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush told Congress exactly what many lawmakers wanted to hear 
Wednesday night when he unveiled his new negotiating proposal to reduce the 
number of Soviet and U.S. troops in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats who had been attacking Bush for being too timid in reacting to 
sweeping political changes in Warsaw Pact nations hailed the President's 
announcement, as did Republicans who were under political pressure to trim the 
Pentagon's $306-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, Bush said he was proposing that the United 
States and the Soviet Union reduce their troops in Europe to 195,000 each, far 
below the proposed ceiling of 275,000 under negotiation in conventional arms 
reduction talks. Presently, the Soviets have 570,000 troops in Eastern Europe 
and the United States has 255,000 in the Central European nations where Bush is 
proposing to reduce U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposals brought an almost audible, and bipartisan, sigh of relief on 
Capitol Hill as early reports of Bush's initiative revived hopes of a 
substantial savings in military outlays within the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), talking to reporters before the chief 
executive's State of the Union address, said the Administration's original 
suggestion for overall Soviet and American troop ceilings of 275,000 each in 
Europe has been overtaken by events. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union will be under great pressure both internally and for economic 
reasons, and externally because of the new democratic regimes developing in 
Eastern Europe, to remove the bulk and hopefully all the Warsaw Pact troops 
from Eastern Europe," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that pressure, the Speaker said, "the United States can well 
consider dramatic reductions from our forces in Western Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker commented on the troop cut proposal as word of Bush's intentions to 
announce the new U.S. negotiating stance swept Washington in advance of the 
President's first formal appearance before Congress since his inauguration a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) also applauded the news. "The proposed 
troop reductions, coupled with a reduction in conventional weapons, can begin 
to set us on the crucial path towards a meaningful peace divided," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) described Bush's announcement as "a 
constructive step," although he called for additional measures to reduce the 
defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado), a conservative member of the House 
Republican leadership team, said he considered it appropriate for the President 
to seek cuts in troop strength before pursuing reductions in nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said U.S. nuclear strength is needed to offset Soviet advantages in 
military forces, tanks and artillery in East Germany, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.), ranking Republican on the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, said the President was signaling his support for "gradual 
defense reductions" and opposition to "drastic, overnight cuts in the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
Broomfield said American military strength has kept the peace for 40 years, and 
it was now time to lay down arms. "Everyone knows the world is changing, but no 
one knows where the changes are leading," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Bush's speech, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, said he favored a sharp reduction in U.S. and Soviet troops 
in Europe, possibly with a ceiling for each nation of 175,000 to 225,000. The 
proposed cutback has been debated within the Administration for weeks, Nunn 
told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), ranking GOP member of Nunn's committee, also 
endorsed major troop cuts as part of a negotiated agreement with the Soviet 
Union, adding that they should amount to more than just "a trim around the 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, especially, have been demanding major reductions in military outlays 
since the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the fall of the 
Berlin Wall last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a leading advocate of such cuts, said recently 
that American troops in Europe could be reduced from 300,000 to 200,000 without 
affecting U.S. or European security. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was 
bombarded Tuesday and Wednesday with Democratic complaints about the Pentagon's 
share of Bush's new $1.23-trillion spending blueprint for the year starting 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), for example, told Darman that the 
Administration's proposed defense outlays could not be justified at a time when 
Communist governments were crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is greeting the peace by saying that he's charging us for it," 
Schumer complained. 
</P>
<P>
It was in this highly critical congressional climate that the President 
unveiled his surprise announcement about seeking lower troop levels in Europe 
through negotiations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, who was scheduled to provide a Democratic response to the President 
later Tuesday night, planned a general speech about his party's goals and 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to do a point-by-point debate with the President," Foley said.

A judge on Wednesday ordered the eviction of a 72-year-old woman who has been 
living for nearly 20 years in a ramshackle homestead on the proposed site of a 
state park. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Gagnon was granted an automatic 20-day stay, and Superior Court Judge 
Karen Sequino said it is likely the woman will be found eligible for a stay of 
up to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing Tuesday, Gagnon said she preferred to live with dozens of 
animals at her makeshift home on state property than move to senior citizen 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Gagnon has been fighting the state since the mid-1960s, when efforts began to 
establish a park on the 200-acre site along Long Island Sound. Her cottage was 
demolished in 1971, but she refused to leave the area.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC'S HAROLD MINER WORKS HIS WAY TO BECOMING LEADING 
FRESHMAN PLAYER IN THE PAC-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicknamed Baby Jordan, USC freshman guard Harold Miner went one-on-one against 
Michael Jordan four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Miner was selected for this honor because he was the best player in a 
basketball camp. They played to five baskets, winner's outs, and Jordan let 
Miner have the ball to start the game. After taking a 4-0 lead, Miner became 
delirious. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would win the game easily," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Think again. 
</P>
<P>
As Miner went up for what could have been the game-winning jumper, Jordan 
blocked the shot and dunked on him. Miner didn't get the ball again as Jordan 
scored five consecutive baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and he went up and caught my shot and dunked it," Miner said. 
"There was nothing I could do after that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Miner's mother, Marilyn: "It was like Michael woke up and said, 'I can't 
let this kid beat me."' 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5, 185-pound guard from Inglewood High, Miner dreamed of attending 
North Carolina, Jordan's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to go to North Carolina because I felt Dean Smith would help 
me become the best player I could be," Miner said. "But the assistant coach 
that was recruiting me (Roy Williams) got the head coaching job at Kansas, and 
Dean Smith stopped recruiting me because he thought I would go to Kansas." 
</P>
<P>
Miner decided not to attend Kansas after the Jayhawks were placed on NCAA 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
After considering UCLA, DePaul, Southern Methodist, Notre Dame and Pitt, Miner 
signed with USC because he liked Trojan Coach George Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt Coach Raveling really cared about me as a person," Miner said. "I felt 
he could help me become a great player. I felt he was sincere about what he was 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said he didn't expect Miner to attend USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Harold is probably one of the hardest guys I've ever had to recruit," Raveling 
said. "For the longest time I couldn't get him to visit the campus. There was 
no question he was going to North Carolina. If North Carolina had offered him a 
scholarship, there would never have been a recruiting tour." 
</P>
<P>
But Raveling's persistence paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working for Lefty Driesell at Maryland, I learned that persistence 
is very important. If you hang in there, you end up getting a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
Although Raveling saw Miner play only four times in high school, the coach knew 
he had talent. "You don't have to go to a car dealership 10 times to spot a 
Mercedes," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Miner has been the Mercedes of freshmen in the Pacific 10 this season. 
</P>
<P>
After signing Miner, Raveling criticized his offensive and defensive 
fundamentals in the first week of practice. "The first week he spent most of 
the time listening to me telling him how bad a player he was," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Raveling criticize Miner so intensely? 
</P>
<P>
"For a hundred different reasons, some of them psychological and some because 
it was the truth," Raveling said. "You've got to create an atmosphere where 
they understand that there's still a lot of learning to do, because they've 
just been through six months or a year of everyone telling them they're the 
greatest thing since the Baby Ruth candy bar. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to bring them down to earth and make them understand that if 
they're going to be successful at this level there are certain fundamental 
things they've got to master." 
</P>
<P>
Miner seems to have mastered college basketball in only 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 12.5 points in his first six games, Miner has averaged 22.4 in 
his last nine. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got explosive potential," said sportscaster Dick Vitale, a former college 
and pro coach. "I think he's one of the top freshmen in the country. When he's 
done, he'll be a blue-chipper." 
</P>
<P>
Averaging 19.1 points a game this season, Miner is the highest-scoring freshman 
in the Pac-10. He matched his season high by scoring 37 points in the Trojans' 
92-82 loss to Oregon State last week, falling two points shy of the school 
single-game record for freshmen, set by Cliff Robinson in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Miner is on a pace to break the school record of 475 points by a freshman, set 
by Tom Lewis in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A prolific outside shooter, Miner has developed inside scoring moves too. His 
teammates still talk about the time he went up for a jumper, switched the ball 
from his left to his right hand in the air and made the shot. 
</P>
<P>
And after studying Julius Erving and Jordan, Miner has become a master dunker, 
having perfected the 360-degree cup dunk. Miner goes up and does a complete 
spin. Then, cupping the ball in his left hand, he swings around like a windmill 
and dunks the ball over a defender. 
</P>
<P>
Miner wears the same number as his idol, 23, and has also adopted some of 
Jordan's mannerisms. "If you watch him run, he runs like Michael Jordan," 
Marilyn Miner said. "But he still wants to be known for being Harold." 
</P>
<P>
Like Jordan, Miner sticks out his tongue when he shoots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not because I'm trying to copy Jordan," Miner said. "It's not something 
that I'm conscious of when I'm doing it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ECCENTRIC 
</P>
<P>
Miner listened intently as Brian Hammel, a Trojan assistant, diagrammed a play 
in a scrimmage. Miner kept moving closer to Hammel until Miner's nose was 
touching Hammel's sports jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Hammel was stunned. But Miner's longtime friends weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Miner likes to feel objects with his nose. He has touched the arms of his 
teammates with his nose, and he also likes to feel the ball with his nose. He 
startled his teammates by rubbing his nose against the seat next to him on an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not smelling," Miner said. "I just like to touch things with my nose. I 
don't know why. There might be something wrong with me, man. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Miner's teammates thought he was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has idiosyncrasies," said USC center Chris Munk, who rooms with Miner 
on the road. "Harold just has more than other people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Miner amuses himself by holding his hand close to his ear and rubbing his thumb 
and forefinger together. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he do it? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I like the sound it makes," Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
And during practices and games, he uses his fingers to feel cracks on the 
floor. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Miner said. "It's just a habit. I've always done it at the park 
where I started playing basketball. Now sometimes when I go back to the park, I 
see little kids touching the court." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other USC starters receive high-five handshakes when they take the 
floor. But when Miner runs onto the floor for pregame introductions, his 
teammates touch the floor with their index fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tell Harold that sometimes he's just a little too eccentric," 
Marilyn Miner said. "He's just a little too weird." 
</P>
<P>
Miner also has rituals that he follows during games. 
</P>
<P>
Before shooting free throws, he bounces the ball three times and then rubs it 
gently. "During games the ball gets wet, and I'm just trying to dry it off," 
Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
Miner also likes to eat. 
</P>
<P>
During a late-afternoon interview in a hotel coffee shop, Miner had a salad and 
two pieces of cheesecake with a New York steak. He washed down the meal with 
several soft drinks, before excusing himself to attend a team dinner. 
</P>
<P>
His eating habits are legendary at Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>
Once, a baseball coach took Miner to dinner because he wanted him to come out 
for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He almost cleaned the restaurant out," Marilyn Miner said. "And the coach told 
him not to come out for baseball because he might be tempted to take him out to 
dinner again. At Inglewood, people would say to Harold, 'We'll talk and we'll 
play basketball, but we won't go out to eat.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE GOLDEN CHILD 
</P>
<P>
Miner slept with a basketball as a child, and he'd dribble one while running 
errands. 
</P>
<P>
A basketball junkie, he played indoors on rainy days against his younger 
brother, Joe, now 15. They'd form a hoop out of a wire hanger and attach it to 
a door to set up a basket. They'd ball up socks to use as a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always tell him to foul me and push me around as hard as he could, to 
prepare me for real games," Miner said. "He'd knock me to the floor, and I'd 
still make the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Miner worked on his game at Rogers Park in Inglewood, where he'd play eight 
hours a day in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that he's a legend there," Raveling said of Miner. "You 
wouldn't believe the respect he commands on the playground." 
</P>
<P>
After moving from the playground to Crozier Junior High in Inglewood, Miner 
attracted the attention of several high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Manual Arts, Westchester, Crenshaw and Morningside all tried to get me," he 
said. "They all guaranteed I'd be a star there. Some schools offered me free 
shoes. But I decided to stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Miner averaged 29.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and four assists in leading Ingelwood 
to the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
When Miner finally decided to attend USC, it came as a relief to his mother, 
who had been pestered by phone calls, telegrams and letters from collegiate 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to go through that again," she said. "It was ridiculous. I would 
sit and look at Harold like, 'Well, what are you, gold or what?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Miner grew up in a section of Inglewood plagued by gang violence and 
heavy drug sales, the gangs didn't try to recruit him because they knew he was 
a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
But Miner had to share the park with gang members, who hung out there. 
</P>
<P>
Once, he took a water break while shooting baskets and found that his ball had 
been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know if the gang members that were there had taken it or somebody 
else had," Marilyn Miner said. "There was nothing he could do because he was by 
himself. He was just sitting there telling the gang members what had happened. 
They left, and within five minutes they had returned with a leather ball. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave it to Harold and they told him, 'Man, you should always have a 
ball.' And they sat there and watched while he just played with the leather 
ball. He came home, and I didn't even want to think about where they got that 
leather ball. I don't believe they went and bought it."

LEWIS FINALLY HAS ONE FOR THE BOOKS TO GO WITH MEDALS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: HE'LL TAKE THE WORLD RECORD IN 100 METERS, WHICH WAS STRIPPED FROM BEN 
JOHNSON, BECAUSE HE BELIEVES HE HAS EARNED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Lewis has six gold medals from the Olympic Games, five from the World 
Championships and is the only man to win the 100 meters and the long jump in 
consecutive Olympics. Yet, some track and field purists believed his career was 
incomplete because he did not own a world record in an individual event. 
</P>
<P>
That changed recently when he became officially recognized as the world 
record-holder in the 100 meters. Whether his accomplishment is diminished 
because the record was determined by a vote instead of an electronic timer 
depends on one's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field, 
awarded the record to Lewis after stripping it from Canadian Ben Johnson at an 
executive council meeting in Tokyo. The 9.83 seconds that Johnson ran in the 
1987 World Championships was voided because he admitted that he used banned 
performance-enhancing drugs in training for that race. The mark was replaced by 
the 9.92 Lewis ran at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Some followers of the sport suggest that an asterisk be placed by Lewis' record 
considering he did not even cross the finish line first in the race for which 
he is recognized. He finished second to Johnson, who ran 9.79. Johnson 
subsequently was disqualified when he tested positive for an anabolic steroid, 
leading to a Canadian government inquiry in which he confessed to drug use 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, however, said his record is legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've earned it," he said. "Except for Ben, who was an admitted drug user, no 
one beat me in a (100-meter) race of any significance in the '80s. In the long 
run, people aren't going to remember the situation. They'll just remember that 
the time was clean." 
</P>
<P>
He also applauded the IAAF's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great that they're making this kind of stand against drugs," he said. 
"It's more important for the sport than it is for myself because we now have a 
record that is attainable by clean athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Including himself in that group, he said: "I can run better races in the future 
if I focuson that. I can run faster than 9.92. I still believe I can run in the 
9.8s." 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, 28, admitted that focusing on track and field is becoming 
increasingly more difficult as he pursues other interests, including his 
recently completed autobiography, his new morning drive-time, radio sports show 
in Houston and his recording career. He has no plans to run indoors this winter 
and said he is scheduling only a six-week outdoor schedule. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Joe Douglas of the Santa Monica Track Club, said various promoters 
are attempting to arrange a race between Lewis and Johnson for a date after 
Sept. 25, when Johnson's two-year suspension for testing positive in Seoul is 
lifted. London's Daily Express reported in December that boxing promoter Bob 
Arum was prepared to pay $3.2 million to the runners. Arum said the report was 
"realistic but not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
It would be appropriate if Arum became involved because Lewis and Johnson often 
sound like boxers hyping a fight when they speak of each other. Lewis recently 
told the Washington Post he believes Johnson has continued to use steroids. He 
later recanted, but some athletes say they believe Lewis is obsessed with 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," Douglas said. "Carl told me he knows he shouldn't talk about 
Ben publicly. He really doesn't spend that much time thinking about him." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has not decided whether he is interested in facing Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any judgments, but a lot of people have told me they don't 
think it's fair for him to come back from a suspension and make a lot of money 
like nothing ever happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if this is a race that would attract a lot of interest in 
the sport, then it should be considered. It's a whole lot of money, maybe as 
much as $2 million for each of us. I have to review this." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he also is reviewing offers to make an assault on Bob Beamon's 
21-year-old world long jump record of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches. Only one other 
athlete, Armenian Robert Emmiyan, has jumped farther than 29 feet. Of the next 
best 18 jumps, Lewis has 14, including a longest of 28-10 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
He once said he would not long-jump at high altitude, where the thinner air is 
believed to enhance performances for sprinters and jumpers, because a record 
set there would be tainted. Beamon set his record in the 1968 Olympics at 
Mexico City, which is at an elevation of 7,347 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis might reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already jumped farther than anybody else at sea level," he said. "So I 
might go to altitude under the right circumstances. I'd like to see how far I 
could go. This might be the time to do it since I'm competing less in the long 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is uncommited on his future in the sport beyond 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the 1992 Olympics are a big question mark," he said. 
"Physically, there's no question that I could compete through '92. But I have 
to take it one year at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I stay in the sport, I want to be totally motivated. But I'll be 29 
this year. I've been around a long time. It's not as easy to stay motivated as 
it used to be."

2 WEEKS OF HYPE TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Random remarks while wondering if a short delay in starting spring training, 
which many feel would be the result of a lockout, would make any difference at 
all as long as the players are on the field April 2 for Opening Day: 
</P>
<P>
It's about time the National Football League learned what every fan has long 
realized -- that the two-week layoff before the Super Bowl is not only 
unnecessary but harmful. It allows too much time for Super Bowl nerves, for 
hype that would be almost impossible for the game to live up to, and for 
America to start to get sick of the whole thing before it even starts. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL for years has claimed the extra week is not for hype but to allow for 
proper distribution of tickets. Baloney. The NFL knows years in advance where a 
Super Bowl is going to be played. Baseball often doesn't know the World Series 
site until the last minute but still gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
In a football first, the champions of the NFL and college footbll this season 
both had first-year coaches: George Seifert with the 49ers, Dennis Erickson at 
Miami. Those teams sure did miss Bill Walsh and Jimmy Johnson, didn't they? 
Never before has there been such compelling evidence that the players are more 
important than the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind all the talk about how many NFC teams (Rams, Giants, Eagles, etc.) 
could have beaten Denver Sunday. Heck, any team in the league could have beaten 
the Broncos that day. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation, and a very good one, it would seem, for the Broncos' four 
failures in the Super Bowl can be found in their record at home and away. Under 
Coach Dan Reeves, Denver has been 54-15 at Mile High Stadium, 31-35 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
As if there weren't enough things about Washington that irritate me, the 
Washington Times is conducting a reader poll to determine the NFL's greatest 
team ever -- 49ers, Steelers, Dolphins, Packers, or '40-41 Bears. The Baltimore 
Colts are not even on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Adding insult to injury is that the newspaper explains all the teams on the 
ballot were back-to-back champions. And just who does the Washington Times 
think won the NFL championships in '58 and '59? 
</P>
<P>
Army's basketball team, which lost to Loyola here this month, has a 7-footer 
named Ewing, believe it or not. This one is David, from Fenton, Mich. The only 
similarities between him and the Knicks' Patrick Ewing are their height and 
surname. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, what are they feeding these kids at the service academies these 
days that they can enter at 6-7 and grow to 7 feet, as David Robinson did?

IN ALASKA, TRIPS TO GAMES ARE COMPLICATED AND COSTLY;

PREP BASKETBALL: TEAMS DON'T JUST HOP ON A BUS AND THEN RETURN HOME THE SAME 
NIGHT. A 16 1/2-HOUR VOYAGE EACH WAY ON A FERRYBOAT IS COMMONPLACE.

ABOARD THE M/V LE CONTE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's midnight. Pitch dark outside. Snowing. Wind howling. Heavy seas. Windows 
on the bridge of the ship are frosted with a coat of ice except two heated ones 
directly in front of the helmsman. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Larsen, 44, never takes his eyes off the radar screen in a 
particularly tricky section of Sitka narrows between Partofshikof and Kruzof 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all 178 passengers are asleep, in airliner chairs or curled up in 
sleeping bags on decks. There are no staterooms on the 235-foot Alaska State 
Marine Highway ferryboat Le Conte. 
</P>
<P>
Forty passengers are students at Sitka High School, members of the freshman, 
junior varsity and varsity boys' basketball teams accompanied by their coaches. 
Seven girls and seven boys are from Skagway High School, the boys' and girls' 
basketball teams. Their coaches are here too. 
</P>
<P>
It's high school basketball season in Southeast Alaska and there's nothing 
quite like it anywhere else in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids don't hop on a bus, play their game, get back on the bus and go home 
the same night like they do in the Lower 48," said John Bisson, 39, varsity 
coach of the Sitka Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't drive from one town to the next in this part of the world. We live in 
tiny villages and small towns on remote islands. We either fly and spend a 
small fortune to go to another school to play (the weather is so bad in winter, 
half the time the planes are grounded), take the state-operated ferryboats or a 
combination of both." 
</P>
<P>
Sitka High School's three boys' basketball teams were on a short trip to 
Juneau. They would be away from home from 10 p.m. Thursday to late Sunday 
night, with each team playing two games against the Juneau-Douglas High School 
teams Friday and Saturday. They would miss only one day of school. It would be 
a 16 1/2-hour voyage each way on the ferryboat. 
</P>
<P>
It was a different story, however, with the Skagway teams. They were on a 
weeklong trip, each team playing four games. Skagway High is a small school, 
only 39 students. Sitka High has 430 students. 
</P>
<P>
The Skagway Panthers left home on a Sunday midnight ferry that arrived in 
Petersburg at 5 p.m. Monday. They stayed overnight in four hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"The three of us adults slept on the floor so the players would get a good 
night's sleep to be at peak performance," said Linda Calver, 42, home economics 
teacher and school librarian who came along to help chaperon the players. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the teams, coaches and Calver flew in three bush planes on 30-minute 
flights to Kake on Kupreanof Island. The boys' and girls' teams played the Kake 
teams twice, on Tuesday and Wednesday. They left Kake at 11:15 in the morning 
aboard the Le Conte via Sitka due to arrive at Angoon at 3:15 a.m. Friday for 
games scheduled that night and Saturday. They would arrive home at 3:30 p.m. 
Sunday, seven days after the start of their trip. 
</P>
<P>
Skagway's coaches are Doug Struthers, 30, and his wife, Rhonda, 28. Doug's team 
had had a miserable year at that point, no wins and 10 losses. Rhonda's girls 
had won eight and lost two. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor Doug," lamented his wife. "His players lack experience. Andrew Knorr, the 
only male senior in school, never played basketball until this season. Four of 
my girls have been playing three years." 
</P>
<P>
The Kake and Skagway girls played a game that almost defies belief. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation time ended in a 56-56 tie. Then two of the Panthers fouled out in a 
three-minute overtime period and senior Stephanie Selmer, 17, who hadn't been 
feeling well, threw up. That left four Skagway players in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Skagway managed to stay competitive and the overtime ended in another 
tie, 64-64. But in the second three-minute overtime, another Skagway girl 
fouled out. That left three against five and Kake finally won, 72-68. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was costing Skagway High $2,878 in travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheap trip," allowed Doug Struthers. "Our last trip was all by air, to Hoonah 
and Yakutat. It cost $5,747. Annual travel budget for our students is $75,000." 
</P>
<P>
Skagway's wrestling, track and cross-country teams also travel great distances 
by ship and plane as do non-athletic participants in forensics, music, and 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Every day away, Skagway students had lessons taught to them by their coaches 
and Calver. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the Lower 48 really can't relate to what we're doing up here," said 
Bob Potrzuski, 35, who coaches the Sitka junior varsity. "The way we travel, 
the time we spend on the road, how our kids stay at homes of kids they play 
against." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the teams bed down in gymnasiums when they're on the road but usually 
they stay overnight at their opponents' homes. Scott Harmon, a 17-year-old 
Sitka High junior explained how it works. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing Juneau-Douglas on this trip. Every time we go to Juneau, I stay 
at Paul Fritterer's house. When I was a freshman on my first basketball trip to 
Juneau, Paul picked my name at random. I have been staying with him ever since. 
And every time Juneau's basketball team plays in Sitka, he stays at my house. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows my parents. I know his parents. Our parents have never met. We're the 
same age. He plays forward, I play forward. We play really rough against each 
other. I feel like slugging him. He feels like slugging me. After each game we 
tell one another we're sorry for playing so aggressively but that's what the 
game is all about." 
</P>
<P>
And after playing, they go home together. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who loses doesn't talk too much," Harmon said, laughing. "The 
person who wins wants to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Howard, 41, coach of Sitka's freshman team, told how the school raises 
money for travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Every way possible," he said. "Cake sales, pancake breakfasts, carnivals, 
raffles, selling out the gym on game nights to local businessmen. This time of 
the year, with little sunshine, gloomy weather in isolated Alaska villages and 
towns, high school basketball is the biggest show in town. The only show in 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Varsity Coach John Bisson, a high school coach for 16 years in Southeast 
Alaska, said: "All the coaches can rattle off hair-raising stories about rough 
seas on the ferryboats, flying on small planes through 80 m.p.h. head winds, 
flying in blizzards, in zero-visibility fog in mountain passes." 
</P>
<P>
Weather disrupts schedules. Games are constantly being postponed. Teams are 
stuck away from home frequently for days and sometimes for a week or more 
because the fog doesn't lift or the storm doesn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3:15 in the morning when the Skagway teams left the ferry at Angoon on 
Admiralty Island, where there are reportedly more bears per square mile than 
anywhere else in the world. The Alaska ferries call at ports in the middle of 
the night, just as Greyhound buses do in the Lower 48. 
</P>
<P>
Also getting off at Angoon were a number of Tlingit Indians, among them Thomas 
L. Jackson and his wife, Mona, both 76, from Kake. They, like the Skagway 
basketball players, had been on the Le Conte for 15 1/2 hours. Indians were 
coming to Angoon on ferryboats from several small villages to celebrate the 
100th birthday of Jimmy George, a tribal elder. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, the ferryboats are jammed with vacationers from the Lower 48. This 
time of the year, passengers are all Alaskans traveling back and forth to 
hospitals, funerals, weddings, christenings, on business, to shop in larger 
towns, to visit with friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Some are traveling to 40-day parties. When Alaska Indians die, friends and 
relatives care for the grieving family, providing food, shelter for visitors 
from other places, and companionship. Forty days later, the family of the 
departed throws a party for those who saw them through their time of grief. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the high school basketball players riding the ferryboats. 
During tournament time, some of the boats are jammed almost entirely with 
players and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
From Angoon, the Le Conte went to Tenakee, population 105, a village with no 
paved streets, no sewer system, no water system, no doctor, no cars. The ferry 
stops at this fishing-logging town twice a week in each direction. Tenakee has 
a general store and a school with 12 students and two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The sun had come up. Spectacular snow-covered mountains spilled into the sea. 
The water was riveted with whitecaps. Sea lanes were marked with colored buoys. 
A long wake trailed the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The waters are home to humpback and killer whales, sea lions, seals, sea otter. 
There were icebergs in Frederick Sound and Stephens Passage. 
</P>
<P>
"A ferry hit an iceberg last year," recalled Mike Duvall, 51, chief mate. 
"There was no major damage." 
</P>
<P>
As the ship headed up Icy Strait to Hoonah, Barb Brown, 43, a 6-foot-2, 
ordinary seaman and the only woman in the crew of 21, was at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Working the Alaska ferries is a much sought-after job," she said. "The pay is 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"Alaska is a special place," she added. "You feel more free in Alaska. People 
accept people for what they are. It isn't crowded, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
The ferryboats are renowned for good grub. Second mate Mitchell Sharman, 38, 
mentioned how a ferry calls at the village of Pelican only once a month in 
winter, twice a month in summer. 
</P>
<P>
"About 60 people live there," he said. "It's really out of the way on Chichagof 
Island. When we pull into Pelican, the whole town comes aboard to eat in the 
ship's restaurant. It's something different for them. 
</P>
<P>
"And everybody (aboard) that can leave the ship does and goes ashore to Rosie's 
Place for a great meal. The ferry is at Pelican three to four hours." 
</P>
<P>
John Larsen, the Le Conte's skipper this trip, lives in Ketchikan, on a 
sailboat. He and the crew work seven days, then are off seven days. 
</P>
<P>
"As captain, I'm paid $60,000," he said. "I'm not getting rich but what a place 
to work! The mountains, the islands, the sea, the people. The biggest benefit 
is the time off." 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Highway's nine ferryboats carry 400,000 passengers a year, serving 
as the streetcars of Southeast Alaska, a vital lifeline in America's frontier 
state. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after the Le Conte docked in Juneau, Alaska's tiny capital city, 
the Sitka Wolves were playing the Crimson Bears in the Juneau-Douglas High 
School gym, where Bears' fans were singing what has to be one of the most 
unusual high school songs in the nation: 
</P>
<P>
"Bum jigger, 
</P>
<P>
"Hoe potato, 
</P>
<P>
"Half-past an alligator. 
</P>
<P>
"Boom, boom, boom a gator, 
</P>
<P>
"Chick-a-wah-cha, 
</P>
<P>
"Juneau-Douglas, rah, rah, rah!

GOLF: COURSES FOR PEBBLE BEACH PRO-AM CAN BE THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES FOR PROS 
AND AMATEURS ALIKE.

PEBBLE BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If misery loves company, there's quite a crowd gathered on the golf courses of 
the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
From the high-handicap hacker to the touring pro, everyone seems to have a 
horror story to tell. And that's especially true if the wind is howling off the 
ocean and rain is splattering into a player's face. 
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am begins today on three courses -- 
Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Cypress Point -- that have given amateurs and 
pros alike some forgettable moments. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara has had uncommon success here, winning the tournament in 1985 and 
again last year. He also won the California State Amateur championship here in 
1979. But O'Meara is aware that disaster is always lurking, even for the most 
gifted player. 
</P>
<P>
Take the par-three 16th hole at Cypress, a 231-yard carry over the ocean. It's 
a difficult hole even in calm weather. Add the elements and it's frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The hole is rated the fourth-most difficult on the PGA Tour with an average 
score of 3.441. 
</P>
<P>
"You try not to think about it," O'Meara said, "but sooner or later you get 
there, and there's usually a wait, which makes it more difficult because then 
there's a debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Should I go for it, or should I lay up (to a bailout area of approximately 150 
yards). If I lay up, I can probably make three, maybe at worse a four. If I go 
for it, I might not finish. I may not have enough golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
"One year, I decided to take that chance. I hit the first one in the ocean 
short. I hit the next one in the ice plants. And then the next one in the 
ocean. I think I walked off with a nine or 10. Once you're committed, you have 
to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the perils that await a player better than actor Jack Lemmon, the 
amateur who doggedly is trying to make the cut for the first time after 26 
previous years of trying. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify his worst nightmare here, Lemmon laughed and said: "There is 
no single one horror story, there are dozens of things. I recall that after two 
rainouts, I went out behind the 18th green and I said I'm going to hit a bunch 
of cut balls into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"My caddie had my umbrella over me. The rain is really coming down. I took out 
a five-iron, and I think the ball went about 20 feet. The five-iron went 160 
yards straight out, and I think a seal has got that sucker. 
</P>
<P>
"At Cypress in the rain, I hit a ball behind me 50 yards, and that's not easy. 
The club got the mud, the mud got the ball, the ball stuck to the mud and the 
ball went backward. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I got into a trap and I realized the club was getting closer to my 
Adam's apple as I was sinking. I hit the ball over the green, and now I 
couldn't get up. When I gave my club to the caddie and he pulled me, I left one 
shoe in the trap. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I took off the other shoe and said, 'To hell with it.' When I got on the 
18th, I was laying 13. I even hit a kid. I was still 30 feet from the pin, and 
my caddie was in a total state of shock. I asked my caddie which way the putt 
breaks, and he said, 'Who cares.' 
</P>
<P>
"I also remember hitting a three-wood off the tee at Cypress and I just ticked 
the end of the ball with the toe of the club. And the ball went dead straight 
up in the air, and a little old lady caught it -- and I'm still looking down 
the fairway." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Don Johnson is making his first appearance in the tournament, which was 
once known as the Bing Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to Lemmon's harrowing stories, he was already getting nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be trying to avoid the Gerald Ford Hall of Fame," said Johnson, referring 
to the former President's wild shots off the tee that have bounced off 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon offered Johnson, who has an 18 handicap, some advice: 
</P>
<P>
"When you get on the first tee, just pretend it's opening night and you're 
playing Hamlet and you've had no rehearsals, and you'll be better off." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy Zoeller said he has been fortunate in that he doesn't have any horror 
stories. "I've avoided all obstacles here," he said. "However, it could happen 
and probably will before I put my clubs away." 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller recalled that when he won here in 1986, the year weather shortened the 
tournament to 54 holes, he and Payne Stewart came to the seventh hole at 
Pebble, a par three measuring only 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're standing up there with a 60-m.p.h. wind blowing in our faces. I hit a 
five-iron quail high as hard as I could hit it, and it was a foot off the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
"Payne Stewart hit a five-iron and it ballooned up, and he ended to the left of 
the eighth tee. Those are horror stories. It's frightening when you just miss a 
little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the challenge of the golf courses. Mother Nature plays a big role 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
The pros will be playing with their amateur partners on three courses for 54 
holes, then play Sunday's final round at Pebble Beach. The purse is $1 million, 
with first place worth $180,000. . . . Payne Stewart says that the Monterey 
Peninsula is his favorite place to play in the world. "I have never found a 
place that's more beautiful to play golf. It doesn't matter what the weather 
is, either," he said. "You come here and expect the weather to be nasty, like 
the British Open. If we get good weather, it's a bonus. I hope it blows and 
rains because it eliminates part of the field." 
</P>
<P>
It has been raining off and on for two days, and rain is forecast for today. . 
. . Celebrities in the field include Michael Keaton, Sean Connery, Clint 
Eastwood, Burt Lancaster and Peter Ueberroth.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
FIRED-UP NORDIQUES GO DOWN SWINGING, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything seems to be going from worse to terrible for the Quebec Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the NHL has been beating the hapless team with regularity. They 
have the worst record, by far. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sign things will get better. Just before taking on the tough Sabres 
Wednesday night at Buffalo, the Nordiques learned that veteran forward Guy 
Lafleur has a broken cheekbone and will be out for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Angered over the way it happened Tuesday night in a one-sided loss at home to 
the Sabres, the Nordiques had one-goal leads three different times before 
losing, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques felt that Lafleur's injury in the closing minutes of a 5-2 game 
was a "sneak" attack by former King defenseman Dean Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques came out battling Wednesday. There were two fights in the first 
32 seconds, and the play was rough throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Hogue's unassisted goal after a steal, tied the score, 3-3, four minutes 
into the final period. Defenseman Mike Ramsey's shot from the point 2 1/2 
minutes later dropped out of goalie Scott Gordon's glove into the net and the 
Sabres took control. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, Edmonton 5 -- Steve Yzerman had the first four-goal game of his 
career, two of them in a four-goal outburst that brought the Red Wings from 
behind in the last period at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would have moved the Oilers into first place in the Smythe Division. 
With Craig Simpson scoring twice, the Oilers built a 4-3 lead, but they 
couldn't hold it in the last period. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, New York Rangers 2 -- It was a good two-game trip to the New York 
area for the Blues. After upsetting the Islanders, 2-1, Tuesday night, they 
came right back to tie the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull scored his 47th goal and rookie goaltender Curtis Joseph came off 
the bench to stop all 27 shots he faced in the last 47 minutes. Hull has 27 
goals in his last 26 games and leads the league in goals.

The North Stars dominated the first 39:56, firing 34 shots and leading, 2-0.

Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain trounced Jo-Anne Faull of 
Australia, 6-1, 6-0, Wednesday and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pan 
Pacific Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing was Switzerland's Manuela Maleeva, who routed American Terry 
Phelps, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf plays her first match today against Nicole Jagerman of 
the Netherlands in the second round, and No. 4-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez faces 
Japan's Nana Miyagi. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, ranked fifth in the world, and Faull, ranked 69th, traded 
service breaks in the first two games, but the Australian was unable to win 
another game. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot passing shots and backhands very well," Sanchez Vicario said. "I am in 
top shape (because) I skipped the Australian Open and trained hard. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Maleeva, firing six aces, overwhelmed an erratic Phelps, who 
is ranked 55th in the world.

<P>
Coach Jimmy Johnson also announced that veterans Ed Jones, Everson Walls and 
Tom Rafferty will be left unprotected when the roster of 37 protected players

<P>
The trade stipulated that Holt, Solomon, and Howard must be released by Feb. 1

Tony Dorsett told a Denver newspaper that he is retiring after 13 seasons as an 
NFL running back, but he has not informed the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jim Saccomano, Bronco spokesman: "Not unlike if one person says to 
another: 'Gee I'm going to quit my job.' That's all well and good but you need 
to tell the employer." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett is the league's No. 2 all-time rusher with 12,739 yards. He sat out 
last season after undergoing knee surgery as a result of a training camp 
injury. It was his second season in Denver after 11 years with the Dallas 
Cowboys.

NEWSWIRE: CHARLOTTE HORNETS FIRE HARTER AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Charlotte Hornets fired Coach Dick Harter Wednesday and named assistant 
Gene Littles as interim coach, team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"A skill that a coach must have is communication and it came to the point where 
I couldn't, as the owner, communicate with Dick and I know that he had lost his 
communication link with the players," owner George Shinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Harter, 58, was 8-32 this season and 28-92 in 1 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the building process is a long one, and that was not a factor," 
said Carl Scheer, team president. "But the development of our younger players 
and the team is our priority, and with that in jeopardy, a change was 
necessary."

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PORTLAND STALLED BY WARRIORS WHILE TRYING TO PASS THE LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers, the best team in the NBA during the month of 
January, appeared to be on their way past the Lakers into sole possession of 
first place in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
They came out firing Wednesday night at Oakland and built an 18-point lead over 
the Golden State Warriors in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitch Richmond and Tim Hardaway rallied the Warriors, and Chris Mullin came 
through in the clutch to give the Warriors a 135-130 victory to end the Trail 
Blazers' seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin, who was one for seven in the first half, scored six points in the last 
two minutes, had a key steal and a rebound, and the Warriors kept the Lakers in 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, one for six from the field in the first half, which ended with 
Portland leading, 66-53, sparked the Warriors in the third quarter. He made 13 
points in 10 minutes and at the end of three quarters it was 96-96. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond scored five more points in the first two minutes of the fourth quarter 
to give the Warriors a lead they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers, with Clyde Drexler scoring 38 points, fought back from an 
eight-point deficit, but never did catch up. When Mullin took charge in the 
last two minutes, the Warriors improved their home record to 17-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, only 3-17 on the road, have won two in a row. Golden State made 
49 of 52 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers, 10-10, on the road, have a 31-12 record and trail the Lakers by 
half a game. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 129, Charlotte 95 -- Terry Cummings had his biggest night as a pro 
and ruined the debut of Hornets' interim coach, Gene Littles. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings had 52 points and 11 rebounds at San Antonio and the Spurs ran away in 
the third quarter after leading by only two points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Littles, formerly a Charlotte assistant, replaced Dick Harter, who was fired 
earlier in the day. The Hornets are 8-33. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 112, Indiana 108 -- Charles Barkley has said this 76er team is the 
best he has played on, better than the club that had Julius Erving and a 
younger Moses Malone. 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, it's probably because Barkley is a better player than he has 
ever been. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had nine of his 31 points and eight of his 16 rebounds in the fourth 
quarter at Indianapolis to lead the 76ers to their ninth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Their fourth win in a row moved the 76ers into a tie for first place in the 
Atlantic Division with New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The Erving-Malone team had great talent," Barkley said, "but it didn't play 
hard the whole game. This team does." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 97, New York 91 -- Larry Bird, nearly a perfect free-throw shooter, 
scored the last six points of the game at Boston, all from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Bird has a string of 59 consecutive free throws, and the Knicks' losing streak 
at Boston Garden stretched to 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks failed to score in the last 85 seconds and made the mistake of 
fouling Bird three times. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Murphy holds the consecutive free throw record of 78. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth loss in the last seven games tightened the division race. The Knicks 
and 76ers are tied, one-half game ahead of the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics lost guard Dennis Johnson with a torn right quadriceps when he was 
knocked to the floor by Charles Oakley in the first quarter. There was no word 
on how long he will be out. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 133, Washington 109 -- It was a romp for the Pistons at Auburn Hills, 
Mich., just as soon as Mark Aguirre came off the bench in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who was injured 10 days ago in a game with the Lakers, scored 12 of 
his 25 points in the second period when Detroit outscored the Bullets, 39-16. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 98, Houston 91 -- The Rockets appeared to be in a position to end the 
Mavericks' winning streak. They held an 88-83 lead with 8:36 left at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Then, somebody put a lid on the basket, Houston went eight minutes without 
scoring and the Mavericks won their eighth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon broke the dry spell by sinking one out of two free throws with 
33 seconds left. That cut the Dallas lead to 96-89. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 110, Seattle 82 -- Tod Murphy had three three-pointers in a 21-0 
third quarter spurt at Minneapolis that enabled the Timberwolves to escape the 
cellar in the Midwest Division. DAN HAFNER

The Soviet Embassy confirmed that it finished shipping four MI-17 helicopters 
to Nicaragua last week, but it said the aircraft were built for civilian use. 
The statement, issued in Washington after news reports about the shipment, did 
not rule out the possibility that the helicopters may be diverted for military 
use. However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III earlier said the Soviets 
have given assurances that the helicopters will not be outfitted for military 
purposes.

Pitra, 57, is also expected to give up his job as deputy prime minister. CTK

Communists ended 40 years of dominance in Parliament by giving more than 100 of 
their seats to pro-democracy groups. The realignment completed an effort to

About 14,000 cars were backed up on the Golden Gate Bridge during rush hour on 
the first anniversary of last year's AIDS sit-in on the span, the California 
Highway Patrol said. The traffic jam resulted from rubber-necking by motorists 
watching 150 demonstrators with signs and loudspeakers standing on the sidewalk 
from mid-span to the toll plaza, and the backup extended north to Mill Valley, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was conducted by members of SANOE, an acronym for Stop AIDS 
Now or Else. The CHP had a helicopter in the air and 35 officers near the scene 
on overtime. "A whole lot of money went for overtime that could have gone for 
AIDS research," CHP Officer Bill Wylie said. Last year, a huge traffic jam 
occurred when 65 SANOE members sat in the roadway.

Demonstrators from at least half a dozen Valley schools walked four blocks 
along Ventura Boulevard from the Sherman Oaks School to the office of state 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles) in a noisy but orderly protest 
against district proposals to relieve classroom overcrowding by operating 
schools year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators want Friedman and other Los Angeles-area legislators to push 
for increased district funding, which they say would head off the need for 
year-round classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping our children out of school today as a symbolic effort," said 
Barry Pollack, a parent who helped organize the event. "One day of lost 
education is better than many days of lost quality education if the children 
are forced into year-round schools." 
</P>
<P>
The school board on Monday is expected to decide on proposals calling for the 
conversion of 109 elementary schools, including 45 in the Valley, to some type 
of year-round schedule beginning this summer. School Supt. Leonard Britton is 
recommending that the board require all schools in the district to convert to 
year-round schedules by summer, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the district's 618 schools now operate on year-round 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that they will run out of seats in elementary 
school classrooms by summer because of continuing enrollment growth unless more 
room is made available through year-round scheduling, double sessions or 
increases in classroom size. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack, an emergency room physician who tried unsuccessfully to unseat East 
Valley school board member Roberta Weintraub in elections last year, said he 
called for parents opposed to the district proposals to keep their children 
home Wednesday. About a third of the 300 or so protesters who marched were 
school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Significant drops in student attendance, ranging from 18% to 72% of school 
enrollment, were reported at six of the more than 120 elementary schools in the 
Valley, district officials said. In all, an estimated 1,260 students more than 
normal were reported absent from classes at Topeka Drive and Dearborn Street 
School in Northridge, El Oro Way School in Granada Hills, Dixie Canyon Avenue 
School in Sherman Oaks, Wilbur Avenue School in Tarzana and Encino School in 
Encino. Attendance at schools outside the Valley appeared unaffected by the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks Elementary Principal Grace Snipper said about 30 more children 
than usual were marked absent at her school of 800 students. After the protest, 
16 children came in late, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Dearborn Street Elementary School in Northridge, however, Principal Richard 
Lioy said 430 of his 600 students, 72%, were absent Wednesday. Nearly 60% of 
the students at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary were reported absent, and 56% of 
the students at Topeka Drive Elementary stayed home Wednesday, school 
principals said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents at the demonstration -- many chanting "Save our schools, no year-round" 
-- said they are opposed to the district proposal because it will require 
children to attend classes during hot Valley summers in rooms without 
air-conditioning, and it will create problems with child-care and family 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, millions of dollars in incentive funds for year-round 
schools and millions more earmarked for air-conditioning year-round schools 
have been diverted by the state, with the Los Angeles district likely to emerge 
the biggest loser. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, who aides said was home sick, issued the parents a written statement 
promising to "continue to fight for increased funding." He also asked parents 
to support statewide bond measures to pay for new school construction money. 
</P>
<P>
Dauna Packer, a Woodland Hills parent with two children in Los Angeles schools, 
said she hopes to interest other parents in efforts by state Assemblywoman 
Marian LaFollette (R-Northridge) to break up the Los Angeles district, the 
nation's second largest. 
</P>
<P>
LaFollette in the fall created a commission that conducted several sparsely 
attended public hearings on the possible breakup of the district into eight or 
more smaller districts. Earlier this month, she persuaded Gov. George 
Deukmejian to set aside $250,000 for the state Board of Education to study the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
After several unsuccessful attempts in past years to have the issue brought 
before the Legislature, LaFollette has said she now hopes to put the question 
to voters.

JUDGE PAVES THE WAY FOR A VOTE ON CITYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: SUPERVISORS ARE ORDERED TO STOP DELAYING THE INCORPORATION ELECTION. 
BACKERS SEE THE RULING AS A TURNING POINT. 
</P>

<P>
In a victory for Malibu cityhood supporters, a judge on Wednesday ordered the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to stop delaying a long-sought 
incorporation election, clearing the way for the election to be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs gave the supervisors until Feb. 27 to 
conclude a hearing on cityhood that the county officials had indefinitely 
postponed in November. The hearing, required by law so proponents and opponents 
of cityhood have a public forum for their views, represents the final step that 
must be completed before an election date can be set. 
</P>
<P>
Jubilant cityhood backers called the ruling a major turning point in their 
two-year struggle with county officials for the right to vote on whether Malibu 
incorporates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best news we've had in a long while," said Walt Keller, co-chairman 
of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, one of two groups that filed suit 
against the supervisors to force them to set an election. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county is expected to appeal the decision, Assistant County 
Counsel Bill Pellman was noncommittal. "That's something that the supervisors 
will have to decide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of supervisors has resisted Malibu incorporation for years, 
insisting that an extensive sewer system be approved before a cityhood election 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters, many of whom regard the county's sewer plans as a prelude 
to widespread development of the seaside community, filed the lawsuit in 
December. They accused the supervisors of violating a state law that sets a 
60-day limit on the duration of a hearing before an election date is set. 
</P>
<P>
Although the supervisors began hearing the matter last Oct. 19, they voted 4 to 
1 in November to indefinitely postpone a decision on incorporation -- and thus 
conclude the hearing -- until construction permits are issued for the sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In siding with cityhood backers, the judge rejected the county's argument that 
the state law set guidelines recommending -- but not necessarily mandating -- 
the 60-day limit on concluding the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
When it approved a bid last May by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood, the 
Local Agency Formation Commission stipulated that the county be allowed to 
retain control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the state Coastal Commission approved a sewer plan that 
opponents said would result in a sewer system 25% to 40% smaller than what the 
county had insisted upon. But county officials have said it could take a year 
before the commission approves the construction permits. 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials, fearing that a newly elected Malibu government would 
mount a legal challenge to that provision, want to make sure that a sewer they 
consider adequate is under way before Malibu residents vote on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Pellman raised the concern before the judge on Wednesday, saying that if 
cityhood were approved by voters before the sewer system is under construction, 
"the same people advocating cityhood will seek to prevent the sewer plan from 
ever being implemented." 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch along Pacific Coast Highway 
from Topanga Canyon to Leo Carrillo State Beach, and nearly one mile inland. 
</P>
<P>
A Malibu developer, the Adamson Cos., joined the county in asking the judge to 
dismiss the lawsuit, saying that if Malibu incorporates before the county 
installs a regional sewer system there, it could wreck the firm's plans to 
develop a $60-million seaside hotel.

NO CONSERVATOR FOR COLEMAN, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former child television star Gary Coleman won a court battle with his mother 
Wednesday when a Los Angeles judge ruled that he does not need a conservator to 
take care of his personal, medical and financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin said the diminutive 21-year-old actor's 
mental state "does not come close" to the standard needed to place him and his 
$7-million fortune under the care of a third party. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who gained fame as the precocious Arnold in the now-defunct comedy 
series "Diff'rent Strokes," left by a private courtroom door after the ruling, 
refusing to talk to reporters and showing none of the usual exuberance that 
made him one of the top-paid stars in television. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Edmonia Sue Coleman of Illinois, had sought the conservatorship, 
alleging that her son was being "brainwashed" by his former chauffeur and that 
longstanding kidney problems had left him "disoriented" and incapable of 
managing the millions he made in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But Goldin said that after exploring with the actor "at some length" those 
allegations -- asking him about his finances and other personal matters -- she 
found him competent to handle his own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to change the judge's decision, the mother's attorney, James Turken, 
warned that Coleman was "a good actor." 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you, he was not just being a good actor," Goldin retorted. "The 
thing you claim, he doesn't have (mental fitness), well, he's got it." 
</P>
<P>
In making her ruling, the judge said she had also relied on a report by outside 
attorney Arne Lindgren, who interviewed Coleman, the actor's physician and 
examined court records. Lindgren recommended that the conservatorship not be 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
As dozens of reporters and cameramen waited for the actor to arrive, Coleman 
slipped quietly into the courtroom through the judge's private entrance. 
Dressed nattily in a gray pinstriped suit and bow tie, he sat passively 
throughout the proceedings, clasping his hands on his chest. He was not asked 
by the judge to speak in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's attorney, Charles Wake, said after the hearing that he did not want 
his client to talk to reporters "in a circus atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Wake said that the conservatorship petition had been an attempt to sideline a 
lawsuit that Coleman had filed last year against his parents and a former 
business manager. The pending suit alleges that the three mishandled the 
actor's funds and misappropriated more than $1 million for their own benefit. 
They have denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Coleman's mother told reporters: "Gary is my son and I love 
him and have done this in his best interest. I'm not totally out of this matter 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had not spoken to her son for three months, but added that she 
does not think the legal battles between them will permanently damage their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's mother had served for years as his personal manager until he fired 
her and moved to Denver with his close friend and former driver, Dion Mial. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Mial in court papers as a "gofer" and a "Michael Jackson 
look-alike," the mother alleged that her son's assets were at risk of financial 
exploitation by Mial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Wake described Mial as an adviser to Coleman and said his client's 
career and finances are currently being handled by a professional accountant, a 
trust attorney and an entertainment lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's father, Willie, who is also being sued by his son, said after 
Wednesday's hearing: "You don't want to know what I think. My thoughts would 
destroy the whole (judicial) system." 
</P>
<P>
Turken said he has not decided what steps the parents will take next. He 
explained that he could refile the petition or appeal to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and lost his other one at age 
5. He had two unsuccessful transplants that required immuno-suppressive drugs, 
which halted his growth at 4 feet, 8 inches.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN SLAYING RECAPTURED AFTER ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police captured a man Tuesday who had escaped a day earlier from a police 
holding cell after his arrest for investigation of a man's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Gonzalez, 27, was arrested the second time at an undisclosed Culver City 
location that had been put under surveillance, said Los Angeles Police 
Department spokeswoman Sharyn Michelson. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was first arrested Monday morning along with Robert Luna, 30, in 
connection with the bludgeoning death of Joseph Mancino, 52, of Los Feliz, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were taken into custody after an officer who stopped the car they were 
driving and found that one of them was carrying Mancino's identification, said 
Michelson. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang officers had stopped the car in which they were riding in a probe of 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Mancino was later found in the apartment listed on the 
identification, the officer said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FINED $500 UNDER MEDFLY QUARANTINE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first application of a new California law, a Whittier man has been fined 
$500 for violating the Mediterranean fruit fly quarantine law that prohibits 
moving back yard produce out of the area, agricultural officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Dull, a farmer, was fined after his second offense, Los Angeles and 
Orange county agricultural officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dull was charged with selling cherry tomatoes on Jan. 17 at the Fullerton 
Farmer's Market in violation of the quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said he signed a compliance agreement Oct. 23 saying he understood 
the terms of the quarantine and would abide by them, and that he repeated that 
promise at a Los Angeles County hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Dull is the first person to be fined under a new state law that went into 
effect Jan. 1 and allows for administrative fines for violations of 
agricultural quarantines. 
</P>
<P>
State law allows commercial growers outside areas that are quarantined because 
of infestation to sell their produce only if inspectors have certified that the 
produce has been treated to prevent infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County will conduct aerial spraying of malathion tonight from 9 
p.m. to 3 a.m. 
</P>

COUNCIL PANEL DEBATES CITY TREASURER'S FATE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: LEONARD RITTENBERG COULD BE FIRED OVER ALLEGED DEFICIENCIES IN HIS 
OFFICE. MAYOR BRADLEY ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

<P>
City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg could face firing or a range of less severe 
penalties for alleged deficiencies in the way he has operated his office, 
according to City Council members who began debating Rittenberg's fate in a 
closed session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of five council members has been given the task of evaluating a city 
Personnel Department report on Rittenberg ordered last year following 
disclosures about Mayor Tom Bradley's employment by a bank that did business 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are very serious charges that have been made," said Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the panel. "The city treasurer . . . is in very 
serious difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who usually handles such personnel matters, has stepped back from 
the case because it poses a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
In Bradley's place, the city's Board of Referred Powers, composed of five 
council members, began going through two thick volumes on Rittenberg's 
performance prepared by the Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
The contents of the report are secret, but several council members on the panel 
said Wednesday that it contains no clear recommendation as to whether 
Rittenberg should face disciplinary penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the report outlines a range of options the panel may choose in 
deciding Rittenberg's fate, they said. The options range from no disciplinary 
action to firing. 
</P>
<P>
One source said that a series of offenses, each carrying a penalty of a 30-day 
suspension, were outlined in the report. 
</P>
<P>
The investment policies of Rittenberg's office were called into question last 
summer following disclosures that he deposited $2 million in city funds in Far 
East National Bank shortly after receiving a phone call from Bradley, who had 
been a paid adviser to the bank. Rittenberg and Bradley have denied that the 
mayor influenced the decision to make the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg became the subject of a Los Angeles Police Department investigation 
following a disclosure that white correction fluid was used to blot out the 
phrase "per the mayor" on a bid sheet that reported the deposit. The 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The council panel will meet again next week to continue its discussion of the 
personnel report.

EX-STATE ACUPUNCTURE OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN BRIBE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chae Woo Lew, a former state acupuncture official who pleaded no contest to 
accepting bribes in exchange for answers to licensing exams, was handed the 
maximum five-year prison term Wednesday on two bribery-related conspiracy 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Neidorf imposed the sentence after a 
two-day hearing during which a sobbing Lew professed contrition, and his 
attorney's request for leniency was opposed by the prosecution on grounds that 
Lew did not cooperate in identifying acupuncturists he helped license 
fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems patently clear . . . the defendant has created a situation where the 
health and safety of many acupuncture patients has been put at risk for many 
years to come," Neidorf said as Lew sat leaning forward, his face resting on 
folded hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how many people are out there practicing acupuncture without 
having had the qualifications to pass the exam and receive their credentials," 
the judge said. "That's the overriding aspect of this case; that is, the risk 
that has been created. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doubtful that the defendant ever thought about that risk at the time he 
was taking the money." 
</P>
<P>
Neidorf said prosecution evidence showed that Lew had been given the chance "to 
right the wrongs" committed, but that he balked when questioned by district 
attorney's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that the 53-year-old San Mateo acupuncturist, who served 
on the state licensing board until June, 1989, was paid at least $500,000 for 
rigging exams throughout his eight-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Lew's no-contest pleas to one count of conspiracy to commit 
bribery and one count of conspiracy to dissuade a witness, prosecutors dropped 
56 bribery charges filed against him last February, Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb 
Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lew entered his plea, he agreed to cooperate with the district attorney's 
investigation of other acupuncturists, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Lew contradicted himself as he maintained that he took 
money from only six aspiring acupuncturists and that he did so begrudgingly. 
When Lew failed to provide information leading to other fraudulently licensed 
practitioners, he was deemed uncooperative, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The man subverted an entire profession and has refused to help correct his 
wrongs," Lapin said after the sentence was pronounced. "Therefore he deserves 
everything he can get."

HILL ELUDES FALLOUT IN FBI INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE WHITTIER ASSEMBLYMAN. HIS 
CAPITOL CLOUT IS UNCHANGED. AND HE'S RAKING IN ENDORSEMENTS IN HIS RACE FOR A 
STATE SENATE SEAT.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen months ago, FBI agents raided the offices of Assemblyman Frank Hill, 
then one of the most promising Republicans in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the FBI investigation into alleged influence peddling in 
Sacramento put Hill's career in jeopardy. But today, more than a year later, 
there are still no charges against Hill. And instead of waiting for 
investigators to resolve the cloud over his future, the 36-year-old legislator 
has decided to trust his fate to the voters in an election Tuesday to replace 
former state Sen. William Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI probe "is something I can't control, so I've just got to go on with my 
life," Hill said in a recent interview. "I didn't do anything wrong (and) I 
would like to keep trying to move up." 
</P>
<P>
Hill of Whittier was the first candidate to launch a bid for Campbell's 31st 
District seat, announcing his candidacy just hours after the veteran legislator 
from Hacienda Heights resigned last October to take a job in the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
He is facing seven contenders for the job, three of them from the San Gabriel 
Valley: Diamond Bar City Councilman Gary G. Miller, a Republican; West Covina 
Councilman Bradley J. McFadden, a Democrat; and Rowland Heights resident Robert 
W. Lewis, the American Independent Party candidate. The 31st senate district 
includes portions of Covina, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Industry, Rowland 
Heights, Valinda, Walnut, and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates receives more than 50% of the vote Tuesday, the top 
vote-getters from each party will enter an April 10 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
During the Senate campaign, the FBI investigation has kept Hill's name in the 
newspapers, and his opponents in the race have made it a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
But the investigation does not appear to have had a significant effect on 
Hill's clout in the Capitol or, so far, on his bid for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans don't often choose sides in a contested primary, but in this race 
that includes four Republicans, Hill has been endorsed by at least 18 
legislators. That's more than either of the two Republican state senators 
running for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who felt free to endorse him, we are embracing the idea that 
he's innocent until proven guilty," said Ken Maddy of Fresno, the Senate 
minority leader. "I think he has the respect of everyone up here. Putting aside 
this FBI thing, I don't think there's any doubt that if most of us had to pick 
the top five Assembly members, he'd be one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Hill has also proven to be a strong fund-raiser. In finance statements filed 
last week, Hill reported almost $300,000 raised since the Senate race started 
Dec. 24, almost seven times that of one of his three GOP opponents, Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who raised the second-highest amount with about 
$44,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two other Republicans in the race, Ron Isles and Miller, are independently 
wealthy and have financed their races out of their own pockets. Isles, a Brea 
city councilman, reported a campaign funds of $189,000, but $175,000 of it was 
his own money. Miller, the city councilman from Diamond Bar, had $273,500, 
including a $270,000 loan to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators, lobbyists and Capitol staffers say the FBI probe has not 
diminished Hill's influence and effectiveness. He is still a member of the 
elite inner circle of only four Republicans who meet regularly with the 
governor to plan strategy and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any change," said Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), 
chairman of the Government Operations Committee on which Hill is ranking 
Republican. "There's a matter of respect and, my goodness, it's just one of 
those things." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI investigation has reportedly focused on a payment Hill received in a 
meeting June 27, 1988, from officials representing Peachstate Capital West Ltd. 
The officials turned out to be undercover FBI agents and Peachstate was an FBI 
front. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony during the trial of state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), the 
only legislator charged so far in the scandal, one prosecution witness said he 
arranged for a $5,000 payment to Hill in return for his support on a bill 
sponsored by Peachstate. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the June meeting, FBI agents searched the offices of four 
legislators, including Hill's, capping a three-year undercover sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI investigation has rocked Sacramento so much that polls now show most 
people believe legislators take bribes. And the scandal has become ammunition 
for anti-incumbency campaigns against some of those who weren't even involved. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hill's opponents in the Senate race are using the scandal as an issue 
against Hill, including one candidate, Lewis of Rowland Heights, who has formed 
a committee called "Throw the Rascals Out." Nevertheless, some Capitol 
observers say they believe Hill is the front-runner in the race, based on his 
power base and fund-raising abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The race, however, is difficult to handicap because voter turnout is expected 
to be extremely low. That means a strong showing by one faction of voters -- 
pro-choice supporters, for example -- could make a significant difference in 
the outcome. The race is also largely invisible because the candidates are 
relying mostly on direct mail campaign rather than media advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
The 31st District is split almost in half by the border between Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. It stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the north to 
Laguna Beach in the south. It is also overwhelmingly Republican, by a 54% to 
36% margin. 
</P>
<P>
To some colleagues, Hill's decision to run for Campbell's seat was not a 
question of whether he should seek higher office, but whether he was going to 
continue in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a choice of either running for what was a logical step up at a time 
when he would be expected to move up, or quit (politics) because he would face 
the same thing if he tried to run again for the Assembly," Maddy said. "I think 
he did what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Hill were not surprised that he would run. A hunter and 
outdoorsman who was elected to the Legislature at 28, Hill has always been 
known for a brazen if not cocky attitude. Critics call it arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Critics and supporters, however, attribute Hill's success to two dominant 
character traits: a sense of humor and a no-nonsense reputation for knowing how 
and when to play hardball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been one to sugar-coat things," Hill said. "So if you don't go 
along, you shouldn't be surprised if you don't keep that committee assignment." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members in Diamond Bar, which is part of Hill's Assembly district, 
recently learned the consequences of crossing swords with the assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted legislation last month to resolve a minor, but potentially 
expensive technical mistake in the charter for the new city. Hill told The 
Times, however, that he would only carry the measure if Miller, the Republican 
councilman, promised not to challenge him in the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged, Miller entered the race and the Diamond Bar city attorney referred 
the issue to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, where it is 
still being reviewed, according to Miller. Hill now denies making the remark. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has also been involved in controversy for accepting sizable honorariums or 
contributions and then voting on issues that benefit the contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), a Hill supporter, said one of the main 
reasons Hill is so effective at the Capitol is his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"In this world where we all take ourselves too seriously, an asset like Frank 
Hill is in short supply," Statham said. "Politics often comes down to a 
personality contest. . . . When you choose between two good sides, you often go 
with your friend." 
</P>
<P>
Statham added, however, that the campaign for Campbell's seat is being watched 
closely to see how voters will respond to the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This race will be a good example of how the investigation and negative 
campaigning will work," he said. "Here it is a year later and it's like it 
never happened. . . . Will another shoe drop? Only the FBI knows."

Arroyo Seco Canyon, north of Pasadena, opened for tourists in 1884 when 
Commodore Perry Switzer established a camp there. Tourists reached the camp by 
stagecoach, horses and burros. They slept in tents or rough cabins and dined on 
trout pulled from the Arroyo Seco stream.

JIM MURRAY: THE SHOE: REFLECTIONS ON A LEGEND; 
</P>
<P>
HORSES ARE LOSING THEIR BEST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If I were a race horse today, I think I would be in deep depression. I'd want 
to wear black bandages and tail ribbons and a black plume. I'd mope a lot and 
feel like putting crepe on the barn door. 
</P>
<P>
Horses everywhere should be in mourning. They are losing their best friend. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Bill Shoemaker ever abused a dying 10-1 shot or even a fading 
favorite in his life. He never brought even a winner to the finish line in 
filets. Other riders were known as the Slasher, the Ripper. Eddie Arcaro came 
down the lane like a Cossack running down peasants. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode a horse as if he owed him money. Horses loved Willie Shoemaker. 
They ran out of sheer terror for other riders, a Manny Ycaza, a Willie Hartack. 
They were trying to get away from the whipping, the screaming, the kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker came to the wire as if he were on a carousel. Horses would do 
anything for him. He never had to browbeat one in his life. It didn't matter 
whether he was on Swaps or a $10,000 claimer, they gave their all for him. 
</P>
<P>
He's the greatest horse rider in history. No Geronimo, Sundance Kid, pony 
express man, sergeant major in Custer's cavalry ever had the way with a horse 
Bill Shoemaker had. He won more races than any rider who ever lived and he did 
it with a velvet touch and graceful pace that made every race a ballet, not a 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode a horse the way DiMaggio caught a fly ball, or Sinatra sang a 
ballad -- with the effortless ease and grace of a guy born to do what he was 
doing. Watching Shoe ride a horse was like watching Gene Kelly dance or Gauguin 
paint. It was art. You had the feeling he could win the Kentucky Derby on a 
Brahma bull. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the mysterious communication between horse and rider that makes a 
1,200-pound headstrong brute do the one thing in this world he does not want to 
do -- run in a straight line as fast as he can for 2 1/2 minutes. Old-time 
horsemen agree it's in the hands. The horse can sense from the feel of the 
reins whether he's in the grip of a bully or a buddy. 
</P>
<P>
For Shoemaker, they almost purred. 
</P>
<P>
It was not that the Shoe couldn't control a willful, antisocial, temperamental 
runner with a bad attitude. It was just that he found a way to calm that horse 
down, focus him in and make him try his best. He was the boss up there and he 
was an athlete whose reflexes were as quick as the horse's, his nerve that of a 
high-wire walker, his instincts as sure as a timber wolf's. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe could spot holes on the rail before they opened up. It was ironic that he 
was the one who stood in the irons at the wrong pole and lost a Kentucky Derby 
because horsemen like the late Hy Schneider used to say that the great thing 
about Shoemaker was, he never made a mistake on the race track. 
</P>
<P>
He was only 4 feet 11 inches tall but he towered above his sport the way only 
the great ones do. There was Shoemaker -- and then there was everyone else. If 
you think Joe Montana overshadows football, Magic Johnson basketball, or Sugar 
Ray Leonard boxing, you should have seen Shoemaker in his prime. He was so good 
he never got on a longshot in his career. He could get on a burro in a Belmont 
and go off at 6-5 in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
He got all the edge he would ever need in life when he came into it two months 
early. He weighed in at about two pounds and the family physician in the dusty 
little cotton town of Fabens, Tex., predicted that the blue, wizened little 
creature wouldn't last the night. That was on August 19, 58 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was scarcely a hand's length long when his grandmother, Mrs. Wallie 
Harris, put him in a shoe box behind the stove, which she lit even on that 
sultry summer night. He was to look like an infant till he was almost school 
age and, when his care and feeding was turned over to his Aunt Birdie Wilson, 
family legend has it, she tried everything from diet to shots to get little 
Willie to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, she never succeeded. Willie Shoemaker not only stayed a foot 
shorter than most of the rest of mankind -- at least that portion of it in 
Texas -- including his own brother, Lonnie, but he was put on a horse by his 
maternal grandfather almost as soon as he could walk. 
</P>
<P>
"That boy'll never play football, so get him on a horse," he is reputed to have 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
Putting Billy Lee Shoemaker on a horse was like putting Olivier on a stage, 
Hogan on a golf course, or Dempsey in a ring. 
</P>
<P>
Farewell tours are all the rage now. The populace showers basketball players 
with motorcycles, antique clocks and Silver Shadow Rolls-Royces, and Bill 
Shoemaker has been honored every place they have a $2 window. He will be 
finally honored when he rides his last race at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the remarkable thing about Willie Shoemaker is not the 8,833 races he has 
won or the $123,398,882 his mounts have earned, it's that he's done it without 
any compromise of his integrity or popularity or the respect with which he is 
held. 
</P>
<P>
A man without a jealous bone in his body himself, he has aroused none in his 
contemporaries. Jockeys change agents almost as often as silks but he remained 
with one agent most of his life, until Harry Silbert died. 
</P>
<P>
Racing, like boxing, often tends to tarnish those who make their living in it. 
No breath of scandal or innuendo has ever ranged alongside the name of Bill 
Shoemaker. There has hardly ever been a foul claim lodged against him in all 
the 42 years he has ridden and he has not been set down by the stewards in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Men, like horses, revere Willie Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he won Kentucky Derbies 31 years apart or that he rode for as 
long as he did, it's that he maintained the image of a decent, honest, kind 
human being who is almost the same quiet, almost shy and uncomplicated person 
he was when he got out of the shoe box. There are no airs to Willie Shoemaker 
no side to him. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder horses like him. Everyone else does, too.

<P>
LONGDEN'S LAST RIDE, SECOND CAREER TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW; 
</P>
<P>
NEXT: SHOEMAKER CAN'T MATCH OLD PAL'S FINALE, BUT HOPES TO EQUAL HIS SUCCESS AS 
A TRAINER. 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker is a man of his word. He vowed many times through the years that 
he would never stay in the saddle as long as his old pal Johnny Longden, who 
quit riding in 1966 at 59. 
</P>
<P>
But Shoemaker cut it close. When he hangs up his size-1 1/2 riding boots at 
Santa Anita Saturday, he will be 6 1/2 months shy of his 59th birthday on Aug. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: Shoemaker has no shot at going out with the same drama 
Longden provided in his last ride on that smoggy March afternoon in Arcadia 24 
years ago. The contrivances surrounding Shoemaker's last ride, shoehorned into 
a live television format, make for an artificial atmosphere. The race was 
invented for the occasion. Of course, no one will be surprised if Shoemaker 
rises to that occasion with a victory. But he will receive the same ovations, 
win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
Longden, on the other hand, practically called his shot. His final ride aboard 
George Royal in the 1966 San Juan Capistrano Handicap ranks with Sarazen's 
double eagle at the Masters and Kirk Gibson's ninth-inning home run against 
Oakland in the 1988 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Shoemaker's finale at Santa Anita, which has been in the hands of public 
relations people for more than six months, Longden's last hurrah was 
spontaneous, with barely 48 hours' warning. It was also long overdue. He had 
won the Triple Crown on Count Fleet in 1943 and five national titles, but 
nearly 40 years of spills and breakdowns had taken their toll. Longden wasn't 
just feeling his age; he had an ache or a pain to go with every one of his 
record 6,030 victories. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1966, he was kicked in the back by a filly named Douceville. 
The resulting pinched nerve required total rest to heal, but Longden continued 
to ride. His right leg suffered the worst effects of the injury, as it began to 
shrink both in length and circumference. The Longden limp became a sad 
trademark of the proud and fearless "Pumper." 
</P>
<P>
On the way to a dinner in his honor, Longden decided to announce his 
retirement. His last ride would be aboard George Royal in the San Juan 
Capistrano two days later, on March 12, after which he would begin a new career 
as a trainer. Many in the crowd were surprised and secretly pleased, for the 
racing community had been dreading the day Longden's reflexes failed at a 
crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
But Longden refused to go quietly. He had accepted four mounts on his last day. 
He won with the first one, a sprinter named Chiclero. He followed with a sixth 
place and a third place to set the stage for George Royal and the San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Longden and George Royal had won the race in 1965, but the horse had been 
running far below his best form in early '66. Several horses in the field of 
nine were given a better chance of winning, including Hill Rise, Tom Cat and 
Cedar Key, ridden by Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"John was a tough old rider back then," Shoemaker recalled. "We all wanted to 
beat him one last time." 
</P>
<P>
George Royal was last when the field galloped past the stands the first time as 
u Plaque and Bobby Ussery set the pace. Longden hugged the rail around the 
clubhouse turn, then angled out on the backstretch to begin his long, steady 
run at the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Just past the half-mile pole, Manuel Ycaza, riding Hill Rise, looked over his 
right shoulder and saw the old man on the move. Ycaza gave Hill Rise a push and 
tried to move with George Royal, but Longden had the momentum. As George Royal 
swept past Hill Rise, Longden sawed off just enough of the corner to make Ycaza 
pull up slightly, eliminating Hill Rise. 
</P>
<P>
George Royal banked into the stretch with dead aim on Plaque. They came 
together at the eighth pole, and George Royal edged into the lead. But Plaque 
fought back. Longden had been hitting his horse left-handed, then went to a 
ferocious shoulder-pumping finish for the final 50 yards. Ussery was all over 
Plaque, doing everything but jumping off to push. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn right I wanted to beat that old s.o.b.," Ussery said later. "I didn't 
care if it was his last race." 
</P>
<P>
Longden's memories of the finish are still vivid. 
</P>
<P>
"Ussery hit his horse everywhere but the bottom of his feet," Longden said 
earlier this week from his Arcadia home. "At the wire, I knew it was either a 
dead-heat or I had won it. It was a great way to go out." 
</P>
<P>
In the final strides, George Royal dropped his nose to the wire just in time. 
Longden had performed the miracle. Victory number 6,032 was by far the most 
unlikely of his career. Sitting atop George Royal in the winner's circle, 
Longden doffed his helmet, smoothed back his toupee and saluted the crowd, more 
than 60,000 strong. 
</P>
<P>
While Shoemaker cannot hope to top the excitement of Longden's last ride, 
neither can he expect to reap similar success as a trainer. Shoemaker would 
have to win nothing less than the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Longden embarked on his training career just two days after his final ride. 
That Monday he flew to Florida, where he inspected the racing stock of Canadian 
industrialist Frank McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe people took me seriously as a trainer from the start, because I had 
the horses and I was willing to do the work," Longden said. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was riding I had been with Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and a Seattle trainer 
named Sleepy Armstrong," he said. "After the horses were put away, I'd hang 
around and talk with (the trainers) about training. It was always something I 
was going to do someday." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, McMahon made headlines by taking Longden's advice and buying a 
chestnut son of Raise a Native for a record $250,000 at the Keeneland yearling 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Named Majestic Prince, the colt went on to win the 1969 Santa Anita Derby, 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness before finishing second in the Belmont Stakes on a 
suspicious leg. Majestic Prince never raced again, but Longden had come 
tantalizingly close to being the only man to ride and train Triple Crown 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
Longden, who turns 83 on Feb. 14, still trains a few horses at his familiar 
Santa Anita barn No. 6. Even without Majestic Prince in his portfolio, he would 
have ranked among the most successful jockeys to turn trainer. His more than 24 
stakes winners included Baffle, Diplomatic Agent, Jungle Savage and Money 
Lender. 
</P>
<P>
Many leading trainers started out as jockeys, but their careers rarely lasted 
very long. Increasing weight, injuries or common sense usually prompted a 
career move. Hall of Fame trainers Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and Woody Stephens 
both enjoyed a measure of success in the saddle. So did Joe Manzi, Steve 
DiMauro and former steeplechase jockeys Scotty Schulhofer and Tom Skiffington. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Longden, only three Hall of Fame riders were able to boast of truly 
successful training careers: Earl Sande, Ivan Parke and John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Sande, who won the 1930 Triple Crown on Gallant Fox, is the only man to have 
won national titles in both riding (1921, '23) and training ('38). Parke won 
the most races in 1923 and led all jockeys in races and purses in '24. As a 
trainer, he won the Kentucky Derby with Hoop Jr. and major stakes with Olympia 
and Jewel's Reward, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, 84, topped the list of race-winning jockeys in 1937, '42 and '43. He 
retired from riding in 1958 and embarked on a training career that lasted 25 
years, until poor health forced him to give up his horses. As a trainer, his 
more than two dozen stakes winners included J.O. Tobin, Relaunch, Niarkos, Hill 
Circus and New Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I started training in Chicago," Adams said. "A fellow I knew told me that I 
had so many friends around the track, I could drop my claimers as low as I 
wanted to and nobody would take them. So what happened? First horse I ran got 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I always figured I'd go into training. The only other thing I knew was 
farming, and I wasn't about to go back to that." 
</P>
<P>
The transition is more difficult than it would appear, especially for a 
celebrity such as Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between being under the horse instead of on top of 
the horse," said veteran trainer W. L. Proctor, who outgrew his jockey weight 
early. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the two professions have very little in common. 
</P>
<P>
A jockey is an athlete geared toward making split-second decisions. A trainer 
is basically an administrator who must think in terms of days, weeks and months 
when it comes to the success and welfare of his horses. A jockey is an 
independent contractor, whose greatest expense is disability insurance. A 
trainer runs a business involving staff, material, subcontractors and 
staggering premiums for worker's compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Velasquez was a journeyman jockey in California for more than 20 years 
before phasing into a training career in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the top riders sometimes have more trouble making the switch than the 
rest of us," said Velasquez, who learned the ropes from trainers Bobby Frankel 
and John Canty. 
</P>
<P>
"Most jocks are out every day at dawn, hustling mounts and working horses," 
Velasquez said. "The top guys might come out about 7 o'clock, work a few 
(horses) and go home. And that's all they have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when they start training, they discover that they have to work harder 
than they've ever worked before. They really have to apply themselves. If 
they're pretty well set with money, sometimes they figure it's not worth the 
trouble. One thing's for sure -- you really have to love what you do to be a 
trainer." 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez predicts that Shoemaker will do well in his new profession, even 
starting out at 58. 
</P>
<P>
"They say good horses make a good trainer, and because of who he is, Shoemaker 
has a better chance of coming up with good horses," Velasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three or four years, I've seen him coming out early practically every 
morning. He'd be on a pony, riding to the track with some of Charlie 
Whittingham's horses. It's been obvious that he has been planning this move for 
quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
Longden, too, sees no reason why Shoemaker can't become a success as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, it takes dedication and patience," Longden said. 
"Shoemaker's got plenty of both."

<BYLINE>

By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the recollections of some people who have known Bill Shoemaker over 
the years: 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hebert 
</P>
<P>
Hebert, a retired turf writer and handicapper for The Times, laughs when he 
recalls his first impression of the Shoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I first saw him ride as an apprentice not long after he'd ridden his first 
winner at Golden Gate," said Hebert, a turfwriter and handicapper for 39 years 
before his retirement in 1974. "I remember this one race where he came into the 
stretch with a two- or three-length lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He reached back to hit the horse and threw himself completely off balance and 
wound up losing the race. I thought this kid was never going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Hebert wasn't alone with his initial opinion. At Del Mar, habitues of the press 
box voted Glen Lasswell the most promising apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 years and almost 9,000 victories later, Shoemaker will ride for 
the last time Saturday at Santa Anita. Hebert, along with many others, wouldn't 
dare be anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Each season, he got better and better," Hebert said. "As an all-around rider, 
you just couldn't beat him. (Eddie) Arcaro might have been better with the whip 
and (Johnny) Longden might have been better on a speed horse, but put it all 
together and Shoe couldn't be topped. He was in a class by himself." 
</P>
<P>
Hebert remembers how Shoemaker was cooperative not long after the most 
embarrassing moment of his career -- misjudging the finish line aboard Gallant 
Man in the 1957 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"He ducked out of the jock's room because he was hurrying to catch a plane to 
Texas," Hebert said. "Everbody in the press box wanted to know what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the airport in Louisville and had Shoemaker paged. He took the call 
and said, 'I messed up.' He didn't offer any alibis or excuses. That's just the 
way he was." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Kerlan 
</P>
<P>
Besides treating them, Kerlan, a sports injury specialist, has gotten to know 
several prominent, world-class athletes and he doesn't hestiate to rank his 
diminutive friend at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind putting that label on Shoe," he said. "To be able to perform at a 
superior level and remain at that level for so long is remarkable. I doubt if 
anyone will have the longevity with the skills remaining for as long as he has. 
</P>
<P>
"His record speaks for itself. He has the same friends he's always had and 
that's something I like very much about him. I'm a little suspicious of people 
who keep changing their circle of friends. I love to see him and the older 
riders when they get together. I love to watch him and Longden and Arcaro when 
they're together. They love and admire each other and it's marvelous to see." 
</P>
<P>
For all of Shoemaker's accomplishments, Kerlan believes one is particularly 
noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"On Shoe's way up, Jimmy Jordan rode him on several good horses," he said. 
"Later, when Jimmy got a little down on his luck, Shoe never forgot what he had 
done for him. If Jimmy wanted him to ride a horse, no matter what it was, Shoe 
would make himself available. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's the cornerstone of why he's remained the same and why everybody 
likes him. He's dependable, fair and has a total knowledge of what a rider is 
supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
"He's become more devious in his practical jokes, but he's changed less than 
any guy I've ever seen in sports who's become a huge success and a national 
figure. He's changed about as little as one can change. I love him." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Silbert 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker and agent Silbert, whose handshake relationship ended when the 
cigar-chewing Silbert died in 1986, didn't always agree on the horses the 
jockey would ride, but their mistakes were few. The better the jockey, the 
easier the agent's job, is not an automatic adage. During Shoemaker's heyday, 
he could have ridden virtually every contender in almost every race, and it was 
frequently Silbert's job to make the call. 
</P>
<P>
One time, Silbert was trying to help a struggling trainer who was a friend, and 
he put Shoemaker on a 15-1 shot that would have been much longer without the 
premier jockey aboard. The horse finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Silbert signed up Shoemaker to ride the horse again. The horse 
ran last again. In a third race, even with Shoemaker, the horse went off at 
50-1 and again didn't beat any other horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Harry," Shoemaker said, laughing. "Is there something you know about that 
horse that I don't know?" 
</P>
<P>
Silbert thought that Shoemaker's ride aboard J. O. Tobin, the time he beat 
Seattle Slew in the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park in 1977, was one of the 
jockey's greatest. 
</P>
<P>
"The drama was terrific," Silbert said. "You could never tell what J. O. Tobin 
would do, and Bill handled him beautifully, leading all the way, and not 
letting the Triple Crown champion catch up. I think that was the first time I 
ever saw Bill raise his hand in the air after a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Smith 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Del Mar publicist and collaborator on a book with Shoemaker, has no 
trouble remembering the details of a certain 1957 race. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know the Shoe, but I was aware of his reputation and how dominant he 
was," said Smith, then a 20-year-old staff member of The Times. "I was in the 
press box once when he was on Prince Leuker, a well-bred horse owned by Travis 
Kerr. Shoe was on the lead and some horse came to him and it looked like he was 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"But Shoe switched to a left-handed whip and came back and won. I was really 
impressed. I was raving about him to Bob Hebert and he wound up writing a story 
with a fresh viewpoint of Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to know him a lot better when I went to work at (Santa Anita) in 1963. 
He was a great guy to work with, very accommodating and very patient." 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the rider hasn't changed much through the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still pretty much silent Shoe," he said. "He's still a very reserved 
person, basically shy. He's grown a lot as a person. Not just on the track, but 
off as well. You couldn't find a more professional person in his approach to 
what he does. (Longtime agent) Harry Silbert brought him up the right way. He 
was sort of like a surrogate father. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoe's a very strong-minded, very competitive person who wanted to win and 
wanted to excel. He's the last link to the era of Longden, Westrope, Arcaro and 
Johnny Adams. He's the last of the Mohicans." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Otis 
</P>
<P>
Otis, a longtime turf writer, remembers a scoop, of sorts, he got during the 
1949 Del Mar season. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoemaker was silent," said Otis. "He didn't talk to anybody. He was 
impassive. He never seemed to blink or anything. Harry Silbert came to me and 
said, 'He may not say anything, but he's following orders (from trainers).' 
</P>
<P>
"One morning in the stable area, Shoemaker said good morning to a trainer. 
Well, the news flashed around the track. I put something in the Racing Form 
because that was real news on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about a year before he said much of anything. I asked him later why he 
was so damn silent and he laughed, 'It's better to keep your mouth shut and let 
everybody think you're a fool, than open it and let everybody know it.' 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have the confidence, but he sure had the desire from the start. He 
was a great, natural talent right from the beginning. He didn't need a lot of 
practice. He was as good a rider on a $5,000 claimer as he was in a $100,000 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a natural ability, which is hard to come by. Arcaro and (George) Woolf 
had it, but few riders do. He didn't have to think things over or plan a race. 
Shoemaker just acted." 
</P>
<P>
Don Pierce 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, longtime friend and former jockey, knows that Saturday marks the end of 
Bill Shoemaker's riding career, but he doesn't think the skills have 
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, if I had a good horse, he'd be the first one I'd go to," said 
Pierce, who maintains a small stable at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody taught him. He just had (the talent) from the start. He did a lot of 
amazing things over the years. What impressed me was his finesse with horses, 
how he would get them to relax and rate (run at a controlled pace) for him 
without taking a hold of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a knack he had. He was able to do that, year in and year out, day 
in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker won the San Juan Capistrano five times, but his second triumph in the 
14-furlong grass marathon is the one most remembered -- a wire-to-wire victory 
aboard Olden Times, a horse who really didn't want to run that far. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks that's the best race he ever rode and I agree," said Pierce. "That 
was a super performance. He never had a hold of Olden Times. He was just 
sitting there, the reins kind of loose. He relaxed and galloped along and when 
they came to him, he was a fresh horse and he just cut out. I think that's 
probably as good a race as I saw him or anybody else ride." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can blame Whittingham if he has a hard time recalling some of the 
memorable races Bill Shoemaker has ridden for him. 
</P>
<P>
After all, they've combined for 117 stakes wins at Santa Anita alone since 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done well together," Whittingham understated. "Bill's a good rider who 
suited my type of horses and my style a little bit better than a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a natural lightweight, which is a big help, and he has a good 
disposition. Success never went to his head and it doesn't worry him too much. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't really changed. He's gotten gray and there's a few more wrinkles, 
but he's still the same. He's always been a great credit to racing. He was just 
a natural and little things worked for him." 
</P>

What other jockeys say about Bill Shoemaker: 
</P>
<P>
CHRIS McCARRON 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody that has had the opportunity to ride with him for any length of time 
is very lucky. He does some unbelievable things on a horse. The thing that 
sticks out is how little he does on a horse and how much response he gets. He 
sure can convince a rider who is more aggressive that a great deal of finesse 
can win races, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always impressed with the way he dealt with the public and the media. 
The guy's always being bugged for interviews and always granting them and he's 
always being asked for autographs and always giving them. He never tells 
anybody to take a hike. Out and out, he's just a great asset for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had to take an awful lot of grief and verbal abuse during various periods 
of his career, but he's handled it with flying colors. It's taken an awful lot 
of patience and self-control. I've learned a great deal from watching him. I 
think he's going to do well as a trainer and I hope I can ride for him." 
</P>
<P>
GARY STEVENS 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of guy who could very easily be my dad. He's a super person. He 
probably knows more than any jockey will ever know. In fact, he's probably 
forgotten more than any jockey will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
"His mental outlook is amazing. He's always the same, day in, day out, win or 
lose. He's pretty happy-go-lucky and always on an even keel. I think he's going 
to be a very successful trainer." 
</P>
<P>
EDDIE DELAHOUSSAYE 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll get anyone to say a negative thing about Bill. He's a 
great person and a gentleman wherever he goes. You couldn't ask for a nicer 
fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always had a good attitude about everything and I don't think you'll ever 
see another one like him. He was talented, smart and aggressive. He had good 
hands, a good head and a tremendous feel for a horse. I've learned a lot 
watching him the last 11 years. He's a remarkable man." 
</P>
<P>
FERNANDO TORO 
</P>
<P>
"Shoe's always been my idol and he still is. Before I left Chile and came to 
the United States, I used to dream about riding next to him. When I was in 
Florida in 1966, I was able to beat him in a race. I was so excited I ordered a 
whole bunch of pictures and sent them back home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the greatest -- not just as a rider but as a person. The days he's 
not going, in the (jockey's) room something's missing. It's going to be 
different not having him around. He never changed and he never complained. He 
had a great attitude and that made him a champion." 
</P>
<P>
COREY BLACK 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice person and he definitely set the tone in the jockey's room. He 
kept peace among the riders a lot of the time and the camaraderie we have now 
is reflective of him and is the way it's supposed to be. He's a phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
ROBBIE DAVIS 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I met Bill was when he came to New York and rode in the 
Suburban Handicap. He came into the room and was right in my corner with the 
same valet and I was thrilled to death. 
</P>
<P>
"He had on sneakers, a pair of blue jeans and a Levi's jacket and I didn't know 
for sure if it was him or not. From all you read about him, he was a living 
legend, and, here he was, so down to earth. I'd never met him before, but he 
shook my hand and said, 'Hi, Robbie, how you doing?' I thought, 'Wow! He even 
knew my name. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a super rider and I wish I could have ridden with him a little more. 
Maybe I'll get to ride for him." 
</P>
<P>
PAT VALENZUELA 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned so much watching and talking to Bill. The way he could get horses 
to relax, he was just a master. He was a master of riding and of life. He was a 
super person, always so positive. He didn't let anything bother him and always 
seemed like he was happy to be here. He's always been my idol and always will 
be. Just watching him ride is an honor." 
</P>
<P>
RAY SIBILLE 
</P>
<P>
"He never lost his composure and stayed on an even keel all the time. His hands 
were incredible and he had tremendous confidence. . . . If horses didn't win 
for him, they couldn't win. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't find a better guy. He could be with the President of the United 
States, and if he saw you, he'll always say hello." 
</P>
<P>
LAFFIT PINCAY 
</P>
<P>
"All the riders respect him and that's the most important thing. He'll always 
be remembered for his greatness and the way he conducted himself all through 
his career."

$50-MILLION DEAL FOR FIRST EXECUTIVE ANNUITIES CANCELED 
</P>

First Executive Corp., the troubled Los Angeles life insurer, received an 
embarrassing blow Wednesday when Coleman Corp. said it will cancel an agreement 
to buy nearly $50 million in First Executive annuities for its employee 
pensions. Coleman cited a recent drop in the ratings of First Executive's 
ability to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came less than a week after the Senate labor subcommittee said 
it was looking into Coleman's purchase of First Executive annuities as part of 
an investigation into "junk pensions" put in place by corporate raiders after 
they acquire a company and cancel its existing pension plan. Coleman, the 
Kansas-based maker of camping equipment, was acquired by New York investor 
Ronald O. Perelman last year. It was learned Wednesday that the Labor 
Department also has begun an investigation into Coleman's dealings with First 
Executive. 
</P>
<P>
Several ratings agencies last week disclosed that they were lowering their 
ratings on First Executive's ability to pay claims after the company announced 
that it was taking a $515-million charge against fourth-quarter earnings and 
would report a large loss for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's problems stem from its heavy investment in high-yield, 
high-risk junk bonds, which make up about 45% of the company's invested assets. 
The value of that portfolio has declined sharply as the junk bond market 
entered a sustained slump several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, independent insurance agents reportedly have all but stopped 
writing new business for First Executive, and regulators have been watching to 
see if large numbers of customers begin surrendering their existing life 
insurance policies or annuities. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a considerable part of First Executive's annuity business came 
from companies such as Coleman that were acquired or taken private. New owners 
canceled existing over-funded employee pension plans, which were replaced by 
annuities purchased from a First Executive subsidiary, Executive Life Insurance 
Co. of California. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the Senate labor subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Howard M. 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), said it was looking into whether these annuities were 
safe, in view of First Executive's heavy investment in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Metzenbaum said Wednesday that he is "pleased to see 
that the concerns some of us in Congress have about 'junk pensions' may have 
inspired Ron Perelman to reassess his decision." 
</P>
<P>
James Conroy, special counsel and spokesman for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes 
Holdings, the Perelman company that acquired Coleman, said the firm would now 
seek other insurers to write the annuities. Conroy said MacAndrews had decided 
to drop First Executive because the Standard &amp; Poor's agency last week 
lowered its rating of First Executive insurance by two notches, to A from AAA. 
He said MacAndrews has said since last year that it would only use an AAA-rated 
company. But he didn't rule out that pressure from the Senate investigation and 
the Labor Department also influenced the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern we felt (about the ratings) was shared in a number of other 
quarters," he said. "We think today we acted to meet everyone's concerns." He 
said Coleman representatives are due to meet in Los Angeles today with First 
Executive officials to negotiate a cancellation of the planned purchase of the 
annuities. Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive, declined 
to comment on the development. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department and the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corp., a government 
agency that insures certain pensions, were said to be concerned that Coleman 
had agreed to purchase the First Executive annuities before receiving necessary 
government approval. Some Coleman retirees have said they already have begun 
receiving benefit payments from First Executive. Coleman already deposited 
about $40 million with First Executive as a "premium deposit." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corp. said: "We are reviewing 
it to see if there was any premature distribution" of funds from the original 
pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
Conroy, however, asserted that no rules had been broken and said First 
Executive had merely been hired on an interim basis to make some benefits 
payments to assure an orderly transition to the new pension arrangement.

SCI Avoids Chapter 11: SCI Television Inc. avoided being placed under federal 
bankruptcy court protection after a judge in Delaware approved a last-minute 
change in the company's debt revision plan, a lawyer for SCI said. The 
Denver-based operator of six television stations, unable to meet interest 
payments on its debt, has been trying to get bondholders to accept stock and

NATIONAL COMES CHARGING OUT OF THE STARTING GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
In its first time at bat Wednesday, the National apparently hit a grand slam as 
residents of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago raced to buy the first daily 
newspaper to take sports from the back pages to the front page -- and every 
other one, too. 
</P>
<P>
The National's Los Angeles bureau chief, Steve Clow, said the paper's West Los 
Angeles office has been barraged with telephone calls from people searching for 
copies of the tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot of calls from people who want it and can't get it," Clow 
said. "The only thing I know is I threw my daughter in the car at 7:15 this 
morning, went down to the newsstand . . . and the guy had only three left" of 
150 papers delivered early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The National, which printed 250,000 copies Wednesday, sold out at more than 
1,500 newsstands in New York and Chicago, but results were not yet available 
for Los Angeles, said Steve Hammond, the National's spokesman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In New York and Chicago, the National is being carried primarily at newsstands. 
But in far-flung, car-dependent Los Angeles, the company is relying more on 
retail outlets, such as 7-Elevens and liquor stores, as well as newspaper 
vending machines, said circulation director Diane Morgenthaler. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, thousands of copies of the National were handed out free Wednesday 
throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were brisk Wednesday at about 2,200 outlets in Los Angeles County, said 
Dick Mader, whose Culver City-based Mader News handles distribution of the 
National in much of the county. It is also being sold in Orange County and 
small sections of Riverside and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 35,000 copies," Mader said. "We probably could have sold double what we 
got." 
</P>
<P>
But bets are still being placed on whether the National's eagle logo will enjoy 
a long flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're selling them by the handful," said Max, owner of Centerfold News in the 
Fairfax District, who declined to give his full name. But he added that many 
probably are being purchased for souvenirs. "There are a lot of people who buy 
the first of everything hoping it will be worth three times as much in 10 
years."

Eastern's Request for More Funds Approved: A federal bankruptcy judge approved 
Eastern Airline's request for $50 million to be taken out of escrow funds to 
help finance its operations through February. The approval by a U.S. Bankruptcy 
judge comes a day after a committee of Eastern's preferred shareholders 
advocated the liquidation or outright sale of the airline and said a 
$40-million advance should be enough to cover the month.

BANKING PANEL ANGRY OVER 'TIMID' PACE OF S&amp;L CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Angry Senate Banking Committee members complained Wednesday that federal 
regulators are moving much too slowly in closing failed savings and loans and 
disposing of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Act decisively -- don't be timid," Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), the committee's 
ranking Republican, lectured a panel of regulators. "Surely, there must be 
something you can do to speed up the process." 
</P>
<P>
"My fear now is that the federal government will manage these assets in 
perpetuity," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), whose state has the most foreclosed 
real estate properties. "I want to urge you to be bold. Go out and sell some of 
this property." 
</P>
<P>
One senator after another expressed irritation with the pace of the federal 
cleanup of failed thrifts. The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency 
created last August to dispose of thrift assets, has seized 256 insolvent 
institutions but so far has sold or closed just 40 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers' frustration is compounded because they fear that the cleanup will 
cost more than the $50 billion approved by Congress last year to shut down 
insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The unpredictability of interest rates and the uncertain ability of weak 
S&amp;Ls to return to financial health raise the threat that additional 
taxpayer funds will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"How many S&amp;Ls will most likely be liquidated?" asked Sen. John Heinz 
(R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
No one had a specific answer. The decision will depend on how much investors 
are willing to pay to take over all or part of an insolvent S&amp;L, said 
Daniel Kearney, president of the Oversight Board, a federal panel that sets 
operating policies for the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) warned that the 
inventory of failed S&amp;Ls and their assets will continue to accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 620 additional institutions -- with assets of $400 billion or more 
-- may falter financially and come under control of the RTC, Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is going to pick a figure and say it will hold," said 
Garn. "We've got one hell of a big problem; it's going to get worse before it 
gets better. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired, I'm frustrated," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
The chief regulator presiding over the S&amp;L cleanup, RTC Chairman L. William 
Seidman, defended the work of his agency and the Oversight Board. Both "really 
have accomplished a lot," he said. "I would challenge any private sector 
organization to move faster." 
</P>
<P>
Several senators chastised the Administration for failing to nominate 
candidates for two Oversight Board seats designated for non-government members. 
The board includes Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack 
Kemp. The RTC also does not yet have an inspector general.

DWP TALKS ON GAS FOR L.A. END; AGENCY IN 'REAL CRISIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Talks aimed at bringing clean-burning natural gas to Los Angeles from Wyoming 
collapsed Wednesday, leaving the city's Department of Water and Power facing 
what it called "a real crisis" in its ability to meet new air-quality goals. 
</P>
<P>
A letter of intent providing for exclusive gas-supply negotiations between the 
department and Kern River Gas Transmission Co. expired without an agreement 
after about seven months of talks, said DWP general manager Norman E. Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
DWP sells water and electricity, generating the power at plants capable of 
using oil or gas. 
</P>
<P>
Kern River has proposed building an 837-mile pipeline to tap a vast, new gas 
field in Opal, Wyo., and bring the gas to Southern California. DWP maintains 
that, if it is to meet new smog-reduction standards imposed by the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District, it must install $1 billion worth of 
emission-control equipment, which will require gas. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot prudently proceed with this investment," Nichols said, "unless we 
have reliable supplies of the cleanest fuel possible, natural gas." 
</P>
<P>
Most electricity-generating plants in Southern California have traditionally 
burned oil, and switched to natural gas only when that fuel was cheaper. Higher 
air-quality standards have since forced them to burn more natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
But because utilities can switch fuels, Southern California Gas curtails 
deliveries if short supplies jeopardize its ability to meet the needs of 
residential customers. One result has been to create uncertain gas supplies for 
electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed long-term supply contract between SoCal Gas and DWP is pending 
before the California Public Utilities Commission, but the PUC previously 
rejected similar pacts between the gas company and Southern California Edison 
and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC supports the contract concept but rejected some provisions of the 
earlier contracts, gas company spokesman Rick Terrell said. The commission is 
also seeking to develop its own plan to allocate pipeline capacity to resolve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Kern River talks ended with the two sides at loggerheads on the issue of 
whether DWP could in the future build its own pipeline connecting to Kern 
River's. 
</P>
<P>
"We must insist that we have the right, at any time, to build our own pipeline 
from the Los Angeles area to meet up with the Kern River pipeline," Nichols 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said DWP, which supports the gas company's efforts to expand the 
supplies it receives from El Paso Natural Gas Co. by about 200 million cubic 
feet a day, has also begun negotiations seeking a future interconnection 
agreement with Wycal, which proposes to build a rival Wyoming-California 
pipeline.

Soon after Carol Thompson moved to La Verne seven years ago, she received 
something shocking in the mail: her water bill. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson immediately called La Verne Public Works Director Brian Bowcock to 
demand an explanation. "She almost choked," Bowcock said, recalling her 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson, a water engineer herself, quickly adjusted to the fact that she 
had left behind moderate water bills when she moved from Arcadia to La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really not an awful lot you can do," Thompson said. "You want your 
water!" 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's situation is not unusual in the San Gabriel Valley, where water 
rates vary widely from community to community. 
</P>
<P>
A Times survey has found average residential rates ranging from a low of $18.40 
every two months in parts of Irwindale, Baldwin Park and West Covina to $65.35 
in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 55 water suppliers in the valley, ranging from tiny "mutuals" 
serving a handful of families to large city-run water agencies. The Times 
surveyed the 21 largest suppliers, each serving 5,000 or more residences and 
businesses. Companies provided average figures for a household using 3,500 
cubic feet -- 26,250 gallons -- of water every two months. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials attribute the rate variations to many factors, including the 
high cost of purifying water from the contaminated San Gabriel Basin, which in 
1985 was designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund 
site. Officials also cite the expense of pumping water to higher elevations, 
and of buying it from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
In La Verne, Bowcock said, the problem is nitrates. Because all eight of the 
city's wells yield water with excessive nitrate levels, the city must import 
70% to 80% of its water from MWD at $228 per acre-foot; one acre-foot equals 
about 326,000 gallons. La Verne will have to buy at least 6,300 acre-feet of 
MWD water in 1989-90 to mix with its well water to make it drinkable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to cost me a lot of bucks," Bowcock said. If it weren't for the 
nitrates, which come from fertilizer and are a legacy of the area's 
agricultural past, the city could provide water to all 7,907 households and 
businesses it supplies at just $70 per acre-foot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard for residents to understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city is still paying off construction costs for reservoirs and 
"booster stations" that pump water to the growing population living at higher 
elevations toward the north end of town. And an annual $1-million payment 
toward a treatment plant built three years ago shows up in customers' bills as 
$16 every two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Walnut Valley Water District also has high rates because of nitrates, 
Finance Director Norm Miyake said. As a result, the district, which serves 
Diamond Bar and portions of Walnut, Industry, Rowland Heights and West Covina, 
relies completely on MWD water, he said. He added that treatment of the water 
is too expensive to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
In Covina, concerns about high water bills recently prompted the City Council 
to take the first step toward slashing rates by more than 20%. The proposed 
changes, recommended by a citizens committee and endorsed by the council Jan. 
22, would bring rates down from an average of $45.88 to $36.02. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, cities with the cheapest water rates tend to 
draw most of their water from the ground, not the MWD. But the bargains may dry 
up as contamination spreads. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley County Water District, supplier to parts of Irwindale, Baldwin Park 
and West Covina, said its prices may be going up in order to fight the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the Valley County Water District's 10 wells are plagued by 
contaminants, General Manager Stan Yarbrough said. And the contamination is 
spreading toward the two remaining clean wells. 
</P>
<P>
The district has installed an aeration tower to clean water from two wells, and 
plans to begin construction of additional treatment facilities for two more 
wells this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately 1,000 feet west of this is another (well) site," Yarbrough said. 
"We're very concerned about the plume (of contaminants) moving further west." 
</P>
<P>
As a backup in case the two good wells become contaminated, the district has 
arranged to start buying additional water starting in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
District officials on Tuesday asked their board of directors to authorize rate 
increases to help fund the measures. The board approved the increases, to begin 
today 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to recoup that money in increased rates," said Clinton 
Nixon, district vice president. "We intend to still be among the lowest in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have little say in the selection of a utility because water mains 
usually are already laid when they move in, said Tom Shollenberger, water 
division general manager in Alhambra, which pumps 85% of its water from the 
ground and had the second-lowest rates among the agencies surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Just as residents have little control over who provides their water, suppliers 
face restrictions on how much water they can draw from the ground. The 
administrator of water rights in the valley is the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster. The agency follows a Los Angeles Superior Court decision that in 
1973 allocated each supplier a certain proportion based on historical usage. 
Every year, the agency determines the amount of water that can be withdrawn 
without depleting the basin, then allots each supplier its share. 
</P>
<P>
The basin that supplies the area's water is bounded on the west by South 
Pasadena, Alhambra and Monterey Park, and on the east by Glendora, Covina and 
West Covina. It slopes north to the base of the San Gabriel mountains from its 
southernmost border at Whittier Narrows. 
</P>
<P>
The watermaster has determined that San Gabriel Valley water agencies will be 
allowed to pump about 180,000 acre-feet from the ground this fiscal year. If 
they pump more, as they usually do, they will be required to buy extra water 
from the MWD to replenish the basin. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District, which brokers the sale of MWD water to 45 local agencies, said it has 
to buy an average of 40,000 to 50,000 acre-feet each year for replenishment. 
</P>
<P>
Berlien, also a watermaster executive officer, noted that 80 of the 400 wells 
in the valley are contaminated. He predicted that local water rates could go up 
significantly, perhaps in as little as two years, because of the high cost of 
cleaning up ground-water contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been expected the EPA will do the cleanup," Berlien said, noting that 
local water suppliers until now have not invested much in decontamination. "It 
appears now a lot of local funding will be necessary to build treatment 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
By late summer, the watermaster plans to release recommendations on possible 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Some water agencies are already tackling the problem. 
</P>
<P>
To lower concentrations of nitrates, and of trichloroethylene (TCE) and 
perchloroethylene (PCE), both possible carcinogens, Arcadia blends water from 
four wells. In addition, since 1984, the city has been aerating water from two 
wells in a process that turns contaminants into gases that escape into the air, 
Water Manager Eldon Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, where four wells have been closed since April because of high 
levels of carbon tetrachloride, Water Systems Manager Bill Bangham has decided 
that it would be cheaper to treat the water. The city now buys 50% to 60% of 
its water from the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
The four contaminated wells, which produced 30% of the city's water, will be 
able to begin operating again when a treatment facility is built within five 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bangham also noted that there is a constant tightening of water purity 
standards set by the EPA and state officials. That necessitates more testing, 
the cost of which is passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a host of things related to quality that will pressure us to 
increase costs," he said.

WOULD WALT DISNEY APPROVE OF THE 710? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Long Beach and Caltrans must be testing people's sense of irony. 
They seem to think that a proposed Disney expansion in the Long Beach area 
would put pressure on to complete the 6.2 miles of the 710 Freeway through the 
largely Hispanic community of El Sereno, historic South Pasadena and southwest 
Pasadena, a distant 30 miles away (Times, Jan. 18). 
</P>
<P>
Don't they remember that Disney (Walt) was the promoter of the Monorail, a 
preserver of Main Street America with its family oriented values, and a 
believer in Tomorrowland, where man uses an efficient mix of technologies to 
solve his problems? Would he advocate destroying these picturesque communities 
with yesterday's solutions to today's problems, or would he spend the $1 
billion to provide a more efficient and cleaner means of moving people, such as 
50 more miles of light rail? 
</P>
<P>
That corporate Disney would allow themselves to be the reason that resulted in 
this freeway, a step into Yesterdayland, is asking a lot for one to believe. 
They would be more at home and truer to the legacy by promoting a 
transportation mix in the L.A. Basin that is not 100% freeway based.

TRASH STUDY APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the annual disposal of 140,000 tons of trash and the uncertainty of 
the continued use of Scholl Canyon Landfill in Glendale, the Board of Directors 
on Tuesday approved spending $50,000 to study whether a solid waste transfer 
station should be built in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Such stations exist in 63 locales in Los Angeles County. Refuse is transferred 
from garbage trucks to semitrailers or rail cars for trips to distant 
landfills. The study will analyze the amount of land needed, possible sites, 
alternatives and costs. In addition, the study will address combining a 
transfer station with on-site separation of recyclable waste.

MALATHION -- THOSE WHO CRY 'WOLF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Malathion aerial spraying. The ongoing public hysteria over aerial spraying 
is nothing more than anti-Malathion activists crying "Wolf!" 
</P>
<P>
When I was a student at San Jose State in the 1970s, we had a fruit fly problem 
in Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
The public were up in arms even before the first helicopter took off. Unknown 
to the public, and the helicopter crew, no Malathion was released due to 
clogged nozzles! The next morning, some of the public complained about the 
smell, headaches and nausea! 
</P>
<P>
I told my pesticide supplier about this and he recounted an experiment 
conducted by a large pesticide manufacturer. They filled a brand new sprayer 
with pure water and began spraying in a nursery next to homes, letting the 
homeowners believe that pesticides were being applied. The next day, there were 
complaints about headaches, ill health and poisoned pets! 
</P>
<P>
With all this in mind, I decided to conduct my own experiment. I sprayed a 
tankful of water in my nursery next to a neighbor who was always complaining 
about my spraying. The next day, I received a call from the Edison Company, 
whose land I lease. The homeowner had complained about headaches and 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
I've been using Malathion for years with absolutely no adverse health effects 
to myself or others. The public's hysteria is misplaced. They should be 
hysterical about the spread of the Medfly!

2 HONORED FOR SAVING MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Covina children who telephoned 911 to get help after their mother had a 
heart attack were honored Wednesday for saving her life. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Candice Chesterton, 5, dialed 911 when she found her mother, 
Frances, lying on the floor after a heart attack, face down and barely 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
When the dispatcher came on the line, brother Ernest Joseph Chesterton, 3, 
said: "Mommy can't breathe -- she's on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The award came at a student assembly at Covina Christian School. The children 
were named heroes and each was given $250 in savings bonds by the residential 
security firm Westec. 
</P>
<P>
Westec, based in Irvine, has given heroism awards to 11 other Southern 
California children since starting the program last year to recognize youths 
who save lives or prevent injury by quick action in emergencies.

DRUG-FREE ZONES WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drug-free zones may be established soon around schools and parks under a 
resolution to be drafted by the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At its Tuesday meeting, the Pasadena Board of Directors instructed the city 
attorney to devise a resolution that would allow the posting of signs within 
1,000 feet of each of the city's 21 parks and 42 public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for two signs at each location is estimated at $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws allow the imposition of double penalties for drug 
dealers convicted of selling their wares within 1,000 feet of schools. Although 
the state law applies only to crack cocaine dealers around schools, federal law 
applies to all narcotics and to areas surrounding parks and private youth 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The laws have existed for years, but only a few cities nationwide have posted 
drug-free warning signs. The idea was advanced in Pasadena by Mayor William 
Thomson and City Director Chris Holden.

ARTS FUNDING RULES GIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two public hearings, a workshop and a pilot program last year, the 
year-old Pasadena Arts Commission has created new funding guidelines for the 
$180,000 Grants-in-Aid Program for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Four funding eligibility categories and guidelines were approved Tuesday by the 
Board of Directors. They are: Category 1 -- Pasadena-based, nonprofit 
organizations with annual budgets of more than $500,000 are eligible for 
maximum grants of $45,000; Category 2 -- Pasadena-based nonprofit groups more 
than 3 years old can receive maximum grants of $7,500 with a matching 
fund-raising requirement of one-to-one; Category 3 -- Pasadena-based nonprofit 
groups less than 3 years old are eligible for grants of up to $5,000 with a 
matching fund-raising requirement of two-to-one; and Category 4 -- individual 
artists who live and work in Pasadena can receive $5,000 fellowships.

3 SOUGHT IN KILLING, CATERING TRUCK HEIST

<P>
Sheriff's deputies are still searching for three men in last week's lunchtime 
armed robbery of a catering truck that left one customer dead. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Ramirez, 23, a polisher at Circle Fine Arts Co., was waiting in line Jan. 
25 for a snack when he was struck by a single bullet fired by one of the 
robbers, who had gone inside the truck to demand money. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why the gun went off or why he was shot," said Sgt. Robert 
Stoneman of the sheriff's information bureau. "There was nothing to indicate 
any struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The three men fled with about $7,000 in cash, police said. The catering company 
was carrying extra money because it was payday at the Circle Fine Arts plant, 
and some customers routinely cashed their checks at the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The company makes picture frames and acrylic sculptures for sale at galleries 
and gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
A company official said that Ramirez, who lived in Chino, had only worked at 
the plant for a few months. "I think Jesus Ramirez was just standing in the 
wrong place at the wrong time," said the official, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they had seen the three men, all of whom were armed, at the 
location on previous paydays. The men were seen fleeing last Thursday in a 
white Volkswagen, which was abandoned about a mile from the plant at 17930 Ajax 
Circle. Later, they were seen getting into a rust-colored Ford Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
The man suspected of shooting Ramirez is described as a Latino in his mid-20s, 
about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing 140 pounds. He wore a gray cloth 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
A second robber is described as a Latino in his late-20s, about 5 feet, 8 
inches tall and weighing 175 pounds. He had long black hair, a black mustache 
and wore reflective sunglasses. He wore blue jeans, a plaid shirt, black tennis 
shoes and a blue bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
A description of the third man was not available. All three spoke only Spanish 
during the assault.

MARKET ECONOMY: Orange County used to be a farmer's Garden of Eden, but 
nowadays most of the growers at the Fullerton Farmer's Market are from foreign 
parts, such as Fresno and San Diego (B1). . . . At their peak in 1947, fields, 
orchards and pastures covered a third of the county, but now there are fewer 
than 100 commercial growers here. . . . After the Irvine Co., which has 44,000 
acres in fields and pastures, few local farmers have plots as large as 100 
acres. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

GOVERNOR LETS FAMILY CLINICS BILL BECOME LAW

<P>
Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday 
allowed a $20-million family-planning bill to become law without his signature, 
thus avoiding a veto override attempt and dousing a smoldering political issue. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed overwhelmingly by both the Senate and Assembly despite 
Deukmejian's veto threats, restores $20 million of the $24 million that the 
governor cut last July from the Legislature's proposed $36-million funding 
package for private, nonprofit family-planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Before the cuts, the 500 clinics annually served 470,000 people -- most of them 
poor women -- providing such services as birth-control advice and 
prescriptions, Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, breast exams, screening 
for sexually transmitted diseases and testing for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
More than 31,000 low-income women in Orange County use family-planning 
agencies, according to the local chapter of Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to rationalize going to war over this issue," said Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno upon hearing of the governor's action. He 
echoed the sentiments of most GOP legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Deukmejian's decision showed that 
the conservative governor was facing considerable opposition from his 
colleagues in the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that Republicans are not just cardboard, cookie-cutter 
conservatives," said Bergeson, who voted for the restoration of the 
family-planning funds. "The governor was faced with a difficult decision, with 
such strong support from conservative factions as well as moderate factions." 
</P>
<P>
"Yahoo!" exclaimed Norma K. Clevenger, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood. "Can 
you believe it? The governor is finally paying attention to the support for 
family-planning programs from the public, from the Legislature and from the 
Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with family-planning agencies in Orange County agreed, suggesting 
that it marked an important shift. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Jackson, public affairs director for Planned Parenthood of Orange and 
San Bernardino counties, said she and others were pleased that Deukmejian 
"finally acknowledged the broad-based support for family planning in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was an easy decision for the Republicans to make," Jackson 
added. "I'm impressed that they would give the governor that message and that 
he would acknowledge it." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian seemed to go through a long, complex maze of conflicting thought 
processes before arriving at his decision on Wednesday, the final day that he 
could sign or veto the measure without it becoming law without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the governor worried about the clinics promoting abortion. 
More important in his view, he said he felt that the state could not afford the 
programs. Later he twice indicated a willingness to compromise. But recently he 
was irked by a court challenge to his authority to cut the funds. And he 
decided he did not care much for the programs anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Deukmejian looked into a political abyss and flinched, though 
somewhat defiantly. Republicans -- including the likely GOP gubernatorial 
nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson -- had pressured him to restore the money, 
fearing that Republicans could be tagged with being insensitive to poor women 
and also become vulnerable to the attacks of abortion-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spirit of Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to yield to the majority of the Legislature on this bill to 
relieve them of a potentially prolonged and difficult process and to continue 
to maintain the spirit of cooperation between the Legislature and the 
governor," Deukmejian said in a prepared statement, referring indirectly to 
compromises on several other major issues that he had negotiated with lawmakers 
last year. That spirit of good-will recently has been threatened by the 
simmering fight over family-planning funds. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian backed away from his objections to the family-planning 
programs, he sternly declared that "I am steadfast in my commitment to maintain 
the fiscal health of state government." Therefore, the governor said, he 
expects the Legislature "to act in a fiscally responsible manner" and reduce 
other programs in the next state budget to make up for the added 
family-planning expenditures. He placed these costs at $44 million -- $20 
million during the current fiscal year and $24 million in the next. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian adamantly defended his action in vetoing the funds in the first 
place, declaring that those and other cuts "were proven to be essential" to 
provide a reserve for "unanticipated expenditures, such as the (Bay Area) 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
The lame-duck governor insisted that he was confident that if he had vetoed the 
bill, he would have escaped his first veto override. GOP lawmakers would have 
supported him, he said. While this seemed to be a correct analysis of the 
situation, Republicans wanted to avoid a Democrat-led override attempt that 
would focus more public attention on the volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with his decision because it would permit the Legislature 
to focus on the important issues that we need to address, specifically the 
budget," said Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). "Had we gone through a 
veto-override attempt, we would have been expending energy and time focusing on 
that instead of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that negotiators had achieved compromises in the bill that "satisfied an 
overwhelming majority" of Republican lawmakers, Deukmejian said he decided 
against vetoing the measure "in order to put this issue behind us and to enable 
us to go forward with the ambitious agenda that I have outlined in my recent 
State of the State Address." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilson Is Relieved 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was more relieved with Deukmejian's action then Sen. Wilson, who 
describes himself as "pro-choice" on abortion and did not relish the prospect 
of defending the governor's action this year while campaigning for his job. "We 
recognize that Gov. Deukmejian is a man of conviction, but we also recognize 
that some resolution of this matter was needed," said a Wilson adviser, who 
asked not to be identified. "We think the conclusion he reached was a good 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian made no mention in his statement of the lawsuit, now pending in the 
state Supreme Court, that challenges a governor's right to use his "blue 
pencil" to veto money for family planning. The governor previously had fretted 
that to restore the money now would make it seem as if he were surrendering to 
the plaintiffs and setting a bad precedent. 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian adviser, speaking anonymously, said Wednesday that the governor 
now expects the plaintiffs to drop the suit. "But if they want to pursue the 
case, we'll pursue it; we're very confident," he said.

REAGAN BACKS BAN ON FAKED ENDORSEMENT 
</P>

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan on Wednesday endorsed legislation aimed at 
closing a legal loophole that permitted an Orange County legislator to forge 
Reagan's signature on campaign materials without facing criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, through his Los Angeles spokesman, supported legislation introduced 
Wednesday in reaction to a recent court decision dismissing felony forgery 
charges against Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) for using an unauthorized 
Reagan signature on 480,000 campaign letters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The state 3rd District Court of Appeal held last week that Lewis' use of the 
phony Reagan signature did not defraud the voters of money or property -- 
ingredients needed to warrant a criminal charge. The court also noted that the 
state's election code held no criminal sanctions for the forged signature. 
</P>
<P>
The decision stunned many legislators, who said they were afraid the court 
ruling would be interpreted as a license for unscrupulous campaigners to forge 
signatures of politicians and celebrities without fear of sanction. And on 
Wednesday, Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) called a press conference to 
announce the introduction of a bill to plug the elections-code loophole by 
making such forgery a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan supports Sen. Craven's bipartisan bill because it seeks to 
protect the good name, personal signature and political speech of every 
citizen," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said. "The right to publicly endorse 
or oppose candidates or initiatives is as precious as the right to vote on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"This right must be safeguarded. President Reagan believes this measure will 
help restore much needed integrity and public confidence in California's 
political process." 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, who helped Craven draft the 
legislation, said he would appeal last week's court ruling to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was directing campaign strategy for Assembly Republicans when he had 
Reagan's signature affixed to about 480,000 letters attacking Democrats in six 
Assembly districts during the waning days of the 1986 legislative races. In one 
version, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) was accused of giving "in to 
the powerful underworld drug industry" for his votes on anti-drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis sent the letters even though the White House refused use of Reagan's name 
on the material, according to grand jury testimony. The ruse was discovered 
when undeliverable letters trickled back to the White House, which was listed 
as the return address on the campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
After district attorneys in Los Angeles and Sacramento counties declined to 
prosecute Lewis, Van de Kamp filed charges of felony forgery against the Orange 
County legislator -- the first sitting California lawmaker in 24 years to be 
indicted for political improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his backers in the Republican caucus hailed the appeals court ruling 
as a vindication and blamed Van de Kamp, a 1990 Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate, of prosecuting the Orange assemblyman for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lewis and his Sacramento attorney said Van de Kamp's decision to 
appeal the case was further proof that he was beating up on Lewis in the courts 
to gain political mileage. 
</P>
<P>
"An announcement on how to proceed in a legal case was made at a press 
conference by a candidate for political office," said Dale Drozd, one of Lewis' 
attorneys in the case. "I think it's indicative that his (Van de Kamp's) 
decisions in this regard are being governed by political considerations, and 
not by legal analysis, and I think that's regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp on Wednesday said that he has referred similar cases against 
Democrats to local district attorneys for prosecution, with one resulting in a 
misdemeanor conviction for use of a forged signature of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass) in a San Bernardino County race. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Van de Kamp said that he was pushing the political forgery 
legislation as another means of discouraging false endorsements in California 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the matter should be disposed of once and for all, and we are going to 
follow a two-track approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Craven said he was sponsoring the bill because he believed that Lewis' use of 
the unauthorized Reagan signature was "egregiously bad." He was joined by 
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), a target of one of the 1986 
letters. She said that the use of phony signatures was a campaign tactic that 
"has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make forging someone's name on campaign material a crime that 
could result in three years in prison and a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also allows the candidate victimized by the falsified mailers, as well 
as the person whose unauthorized signature was used, to sue for actual and 
punitive damages in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
"As it would apply to the Lewis case hypothetically, Ronald Reagan would be 
able to sue the people who forged his name," Van de Kamp said. "Sally Tanner 
would be able to sue the people who smeared her reputation. And the state of 
California would be able to seek criminal penalties against those who swindled 
the voters."

RULING OKS ABORTION BLOCKADES;

PROTESTS: A FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSED A SUIT CHALLENGING OPERATION RESCUE ACTIONS 
AT FAMILY-PLANNING CLINICS. ACLU ATTORNEYS PLAN TO APPEAL.

A federal judge awarded a major victory to anti-abortion forces Wednesday in 
dismissing a lawsuit which asserted that Operation Rescue's blockades at 
family-planning clinics violated the civil rights of women seeking to use the 
clinics' services. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima denied claims by the National Abortion 
Federation and other pro-choice groups that Operation Rescue's actions violated 
a woman's right to travel and her right to obtain an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima also vacated a preliminary injunction he issued March 15 barring 
blockades, thus freeing abortion opponents to reinstitute such actions without 
fear of legal consequences in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great result for us," Operation Rescue attorney Victor Smith said of 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, while Tashima's decision "is not a world-changing decision, it 
will limit the tools of the opposition to interfere with the protests." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Finn, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue's Southern California 
organization based in Anaheim, said, "We're encouraged that Judge Tashima feels 
that there are no grounds on a federal level to prevent Operaton Rescue from 
saving babies and women from the destruction of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Finn said the organization's next major blockade is scheduled Feb. 17, but said 
the location will not be revealed until a few days before the action. 
</P>
<P>
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel, the lead lawyer for the 
plaintiffs, said she will ask Tashima to stay his ruling today, while she 
appeals the decision in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
She stressed that Tashima's decision was in conflict with a ruling by a federal 
appeals court in New York last September and decisions by federal judges in 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ruling not a surprise. In September, Tashima had ruled that 
"abortion seekers" are not a special class of people entitled to protection 
under the Ku Klux Klan Act, a 19th-Century civil rights law that was the 
underpinning of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima told the plaintiffs, including several family-planning clinics, that 
they could amend their complaint. But he expressed doubts about whether they 
could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorneys filed new papers in the case. But in his decision Wednesday, 
Tashima said they had not met their burden of showing that pregnant women were 
entitled to protection under the 19th-Century law. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also stated that health-care clinics were not a protected class under 
the Ku Klux Klan Act. 
</P>
<P>
The statute was enacted during the Reconstruction era in the South and was 
designed to protect blacks from attacks by racists, but it has been applied to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said that if the ACLU's appeal is spurned by the 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, she will file a new suit in a California state court seeking to enjoin 
Operation Rescue blockades.

O.C. TRANSIT OFFICIALS SEE BATTLE IN CONGRESS OVER PROPOSED CUTS 
</P>

Orange County officials predict a pitched battle in Congress over provisions of 
the 1991 federal budget that would eliminate $10 million in subsidies for local 
bus service and cloud the county's plan to build a network of busways to ease 
freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The county's chief transit official said fare increases and service reductions 
could be required if the budget unveiled by President Bush this week is enacted 
as written, but at least one key Congress member predicted that the 
transportation proposals will be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has a ghost of a chance of clearing Congress," said Rep. Ron 
Packard (R-Carlsbad), a member of the powerful House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee. Packard's 43rd Congressional District includes 
southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Reichert, general manager of the Orange County Transit District, said 
the Administration's plan would be a "disaster" for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we'd lose over $10 million in operating support," Reichert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal subsidy provides about 10% of the annual revenue of the district, 
which operates a fleet of 600 buses and carries 40 million passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
In his $1.23-trillion federal budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 
Bush proposes the elimination of Urban Mass Transportation Administration 
operating subsidies for transit districts that serve areas with populations of 
1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating subsidies for large transit districts, the Administration would 
reduce overallUMTA subsidies by $548 million, to $1.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Right off the bat, that seems a little unrealistic to ask transit to take a 
33% cut," said James F. McConnell, Orange County's Washington lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the UMTA budget provides no money for new mass transit projects, 
which could include a series of planned busways in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The county has no pending requests for federal busway aid. However, in future 
years, the lack of funding "could have some serious impact on our transitways 
program," Reichert said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard and several congressional aides said they expect that the House 
Appropriations Committee will restore a substantial amount of the operating 
subsidies for large transit districts. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) said that the Bush cuts "are an 
unacceptable reduction and would lead toward elimination of the federal role in 
mass transit." Anderson is chairman of the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, officials said, the coming battle will be a replay of the 
annual tug-of-war that began in 1984 when the Reagan Administration first 
proposed heavy cuts in the UMTA account. Each year, Congress has restored most 
of the UMTA funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, key committee aides and other officials said that this year, as 
Congress devotes more attention to reducing the federal budget deficit, urban 
mass transit programs are not likely to receive the highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal concern to Orange County officials is the UMTA account that pays for 
construction of urban rail systems, including the Los Angeles Metrorail 
project, and special freeway lanes that are dedicated to bus use and physically 
separated from regular freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating any discretionary funds for new projects, "What they're saying 
is, 'No new starts,' " McConnell said. "I think the purpose of this proposal is 
not just no new starts in 1991; I think it's no new starts ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That would take the federal government out of any participation in the future 
(Orange County) transitway project." 
</P>
<P>
The county has approved construction of 20 miles of bus lanes along local 
freeway corridors. The first seven-mile section is to run along the Santa Ana 
Freeway in the central part of the county, Reichert said. Funds have been set 
aside for construction of the first phase, Reichert said, but the county will 
be looking to the federal government to help build additional parts of the 
system.

UCI ACTS TO CLARIFY GAY HOUSING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at UC Irvine, in their strongest declaration to date on the 
thorny issue of domestic partnerships, said Wednesday that "gay and lesbian 
couples . . . do not qualify for family housing." 
</P>
<P>
A university policy statement said that gays have the same rights as all other 
students to seek exceptions to the housing policy based on such factors as 
financial hardship. But it emphasized that the procedure "does not authorize an 
exception to be made on the basis of a gay or lesbian relationship." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of protests on campus in recent days over what was seen as a 
reversal of gay rights, the university's formal statement on the issue was 
aimed at quelling widespread speculation and some confusion over the school's 
policy. But some gay leaders reacted angrily nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether gay couples can rent family-housing units on campus, 
modestly priced at $450 to $650 a month, took on added potency, coming less 
than three months after city of Irvine voters stripped gay rights protections 
from a city law in a heated ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
University administrators insisted that their statement Wednesday marked only a 
clarification of existing policy, not a change -- even though at least three 
lesbian couples are now living together in student housing. 
</P>
<P>
"A gay or lesbian relationship is not grounds for a non-student being allowed 
to live in student housing, and it never has been," Chancellor J.W. Peltason 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Under the university's policy, unmarried heterosexual couples are also excluded 
from family housing. But gay leaders counter that -- unlike heterosexual 
couples -- they are prohibited by law from being married and should instead by 
recognized as domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
Some gay-rights advocates said that Peltason's statement appeared to mark a 
softening of the administration's position as a result of recent protests. 
</P>
<P>
In sending word to the campus last week that gays would not be given married 
housing, the gay-rights advocates said, the university appeared to leave no 
room for exceptions, but the issue now seems open to that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win in the sense that we're back to where we started," said Christine 
Browning, a university psychologist who helps head a campus panel on gays. 
</P>
<P>
But gay student leader Randy Kerr disagreed, saying: "I consider this a step 
backward." 
</P>
<P>
"The university's saying 'you don't have a right (to family housing), but we 
may give it to you anyway.' That's not going to be enough; in fact, it's pretty 
demeaning," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three lesbian couples now in family housing is being asked to 
leave, administrators said. ERIC LICHTBLAU

COMPANY, CITY SCRAP OVER MEETING NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brady Jr. declined Wednesday to release his notes of a Jan. 
10 meeting with top city and Irvine Co. officials, despite the company's 
suggestion that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, the company encouraged Mayor Larry Agran and Brady to 
release the notes, which the company said would provide evidence that Agran had 
threatened to delay action on Village 38, a company project, unless it backed 
off its support for an overpass expansion proposal that the mayor opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that there is anything in the notes that is a problem," Brady said 
Wednesday. "It's just that they're notes to file, and they're not meant for 
release. . . . They're not part of any public record." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange followed a Tuesday press conference by Agran, in which the mayor 
produced copies of two memos indicating that a senior officer of the Irvine Co. 
recently suggested that the company is planning several mass mailings on an 
overpass proposal for Yale Loop. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Irvine is involved in what has so far been a successful struggle 
for independence," Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
That independence, he added, is threatened by the company's efforts to sway the 
outcome of the overpass dispute and simultaneously aid Agran's political foes. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-page written response, company officials dismissed Agran's 
allegations and said the mayor is trying to "drive a wedge between the company 
and the community" for political reasons. The statement further said its 
support for the overpass proposal does not include endorsement or support of 
candidates who back the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Agran opposes the proposal to widen two Yale Loop pedestrian overpasses so they 
can accommodate auto traffic, while his chief opponent, Councilwoman Sally Anne 
Sheridan, supports the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, however, said she receives no support from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two Yale bridges spans the San Diego Freeway; the other crosses the 
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad tracks. The bridges can already 
accommodate emergency vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Costs for the project are still undetermined, but preliminary estimates have 
indicated a tab of about $3 million per bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The matter will go before city voters on the June 5 ballot, at the same time 
that voters will elect a mayor and two council members. JIM NEWTON

$2,587,260 RAISED FOR DEFEATED MEASURE M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of Measure M, the half-cent transportation sales tax defeated last 
November, raised a record-breaking $2,587,260 in their unsuccessful campaign, 
finance reports showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Yes on M surpassed the previous record of $2,522,527 set by 
Citizens for Traffic Solutions, the group that successfully opposed a June, 
1988, slow-growth and traffic initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually the same major donors -- builders, developers, real estate firms and 
construction companies -- funded both efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although final campaign finance reports were not immediately available for all 
of the committees that successfully opposed Measure M last November, their 
receipts and expenditures were not expected to exceed a combined total of 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, which may be placed before voters again this fall, would have raised 
an estimated $3.1 billion for new freeway lanes, car-pool lanes, so-called 
super streets, local street repairs, and several commuter rail and high-tech 
transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
Political experts attributed its defeat to a low voter turnout (22%) in which 
primarily older, more conservative county residents went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Measure M, however, said that some voters were probably offended by 
the huge amount of money being spent on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obscene," said Jerry Yudelson, who campaigned against Measure M. "It was 
a political consultants' full employment act." But former county supervisor 
Bruce Nestande, who headed the pro-M campaign said: "It's nice to be part of a 
record-breaking operation. We knew that it was going to be a very expensive 
campaign going in." 
</P>
<P>
The Measure M finance report showed that Nestande's committee spent $2,403,902, 
which is below the $2,525,506 in expenditures reported a year ago in the effort 
against the slow-growth initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest cash contributions were $146,932 from the Irvine Co., $104,099 from 
Rancho Santa Margarita, $61,599 from the Koll Co. and $50,000 from the Lincoln 
Club of Orange County, an influential Republican volunteer organization.

CHANGE PLANNED FOR TOWN &amp; COUNTRY SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consultant for Orange Town Ltd., owners of the Town &amp; Country shopping 
center, announced plans to redevelop the 15-acre property into one of the 
county's major commercial centers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Beam, a former mayor of Orange, said Orange Town, a Burlingame-based 
partnership, intends to file an application for the $500-million project next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans, Beam said, include a 500-room hotel, a high-rise condominium 
tower and four office buildings with lower levels that could accommodate 
400,000 square feet of retail space. The plans also include two six-level 
garages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still fine-tuning the plan, and there could be changes," Beam said. 
</P>
<P>
John Godlewski, a city planner, said that Orange Town Ltd. would have to apply 
for a site permit. It also must seek a revision to the city's General Plan, 
because the developer's plans may exceed a city limitation for square footage. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major concerns, in addition to commercial office space, was the 
traffic that such a shopping and business center would create. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the street is Santa Ana's Main Place shopping mall, and nearby is 
the site for a proposed hotel, retail center and high-rise buildings, that has 
been proposed by Orient Finance Co., a Japanese credit firm. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Mayor Don E. Smith noted that Santa Ana and Orange have an agreement 
enabling both cities to work together on such issues as potential traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who did not say he favored the high-rise idea, acknowledged that the 
county is becoming "more urban," with a tendency to put high-rise structures in 
its central core. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying you can put up high-rise buildings anywhere in the city, but 
there is a tendency now to allow them in certain areas like the central area," 
he said. DAVID REYES

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER '4-10' PLAN FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider a proposal next Monday to offer police officers 
a four-day, 10-hour work schedule and a plan that would help pay for it -- 
establishment of a lighting and landscape assessment district that would 
increase taxes for each homeowner by an average of $35 annually. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city staff report, the "4-10" proposal for police officers would 
require the hiring of 15 more officers and would cost approximately $1.3 
million for manpower and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed assessment district would bring in nearly $3 million to be used to 
maintain the city's 13,000 street lights and 23 acres of median landscaping, 
according to the city staff. The city's general fund currently pays for the 
maintenance. Homeowners and business owners would pay increases in property 
taxes of between $13 and $39, depending on their location. 
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of such a district, the extra money from the general 
fund would then be allocated to the Police Department to pay for the "4-10" 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment district report commissioned by the city, Santa Ana 
has had problems with the increasing cost of maintaining its lighting and 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional methods of raising revenue are being re-evaluated, and 
revenue-producing programs which may prove unpopular may have to be 
considered," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
During the adoption of the 1989-90 budget in September, the council asked the 
city staff to develop a "4-10" plan for the police, as well as a plan 
establishing the lighting and landscaping assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Don Blankenship, president of the Santa Ana Police Benevolent Assn., which 
represents 351 rank-and-file police officers, said the council ought to support 
the "4-10" plan because it would attract more officers to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way to cut down the frustration level for the officers," Blankenship 
said. "Recruitment will be a whole lot easier with this kind of plan." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship said his organization has been trying to get a "4-10" plan in the 
city for a decade now. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young, who favors studying the "4-10" plan, said he opposes the 
establishment of the assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suicidal. There's going to be a tax revolt in the city" if the assessment 
district is approved, Young said. LILY ENG

MAN SAVES NIECE AND NEPHEW FROM FIRE

A 23-year-old man rescued his infant niece from a fire that erupted Wednesday 
in the girl's bedroom and then injured himself trying to put out the blaze, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for him, she would have died," said Santa Ana Fire Department 
Capt. Robert Soria. 
</P>
<P>
"He acted quickly and did a really good job." 
</P>
<P>
Elliot Dunning was getting ready to go to work at about 9:15 a.m Wednesday when 
he heard a crackling noise in his niece's bedroom, Soria said. The house is in 
the 1700 block of Raymar Street. 
</P>
<P>
When Dunning opened the bedroom door, he saw that a portable floor heater had 
melted through an electrical cord and had ignited a mattress next to the girl's 
crib. 
</P>
<P>
The uncle grabbed the infant and alerted his 5-year-old nephew to get out of 
the house, Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
"He went back into house to try to smother the fire with a blanket but only 
helped to spread flames before smoke overcame him," Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
After Dunning ran back outside, he tore open the security bars that covered the 
bedroom window and punched a hole in the glass with his fist. He tried to 
control the fire with a garden hose until the fire units arrived, Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished the flames within 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning's 5-year-old nephew wept as he watched fire crews work to put out the 
blaze. "All my toys are in there," he cried. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning received minor cuts on his hand and suffered from smoke inhalation, 
Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained to the bedroom, which was destroyed. Fire officials 
estimated the damage at $20,000 to the structure and $5,000 in damage to the 
furniture. MATT LAIT and MARK BOSTER

SUNNY HILLS AWAKENS, BEATS FULLERTON, 89-75

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first quarter of its game against Fullerton High School Wednesday 
night, Sunny Hills seemed content to stand back and watch. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Lancers, and everyone else in the packed Sunny Hills gymnasium, 
were mesmerized by the hot hand of Fullerton's Rene Arias, who scored 12 
consecutive points in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunny Hills didn't doze long, picking up its intensity in each quarter en 
route to an 89-75 Freeway League victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory boosts Sunny Hills (8-11, 6-1 in league) into sole possession of 
first place. Fullerton (8-12, 5-2) falls to second. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills trailed, 21-16, after the first quarter, but in the second quarter 
began to utilize an intense man-to-man defense, forcing several turnovers. 
Dominic Carnesi's three-pointer at the buzzer gave Sunny Hills a 38-27 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers then went on a 15-0 run in the third quarter, holding Fullerton 
scoreless for nearly three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter, Sunny Hills led, 65-48. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very tight in the first quarter for some reason," Sunny Hills Coach 
Steve White said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we relaxed and started playing fundamental basketball." 
</P>
<P>
That means Sunny Hills started taking advantage of its height -- especially 
that of its two center/forwards: 6-foot-6 sophomore Terry Mann and 6-7 junior 
Brett Mitchelson. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Mann and Mitchelson provided plenty of defense inside, frustrating 
Fullerton with several blocked shots and steals. 
</P>
<P>
And Mitchelson, who missed the first seven games of the season with a pulled 
quadriceps muscle, led the Lancers with 27 points, scoring many from inside on 
turnaround bank shots and follows. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first game he's really played well," White said of Mitchelson. 
"It's by far his best game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Arias, meanwhile, could only watch as his first-quarter hot streak went cold 
through the next two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing the first quarter with 12 of Fullerton's 21 points, Arias 
missed four consecutive field goals and two free throws in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arias went 0-for-4 from the field again in the third quarter before finding his 
groove in the fourth, when he scored 17 points -- including three 
three-pointers -- to finish with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
"You live and die by the three-pointer and tonight we died by it," Fullerton 
Coach Chris Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the kind of shooter (Arias) is. Very streaky. The problem is our 
other three guards are juniors. When we get behind, we tend to rely on Rene too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Mitchelson, Sunny Hills received double-figure scoring from Dominic 
Carnesi (24 points), David Ragsdale (13), Mann (11) and Kenny Overby 10.

HOT-SHOOTING EDISON STOPS FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S WINNING STREAK

<P>
Some accurate shooting in the second quarter was enough to cool off the hottest 
team in the Sunset League Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Edison High School made eight of 11 shots in the second quarter and rolled to a 
61-36 victory over Fountain Valley, ending the Barons' winning streak at four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (10-11, 4-3) was coming off victories against league-leading 
Marina and second-place Ocean View. The comeback victory over Ocean View came 
after Fountain Valley had fallen behind by 21 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Gordon Billingsley suited up only seven players against Edison and 
the results were predictable. Edison's physical frontline wore down Fountain 
Valley and turned the game into a mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (16-6, 5-2) utilized the inside scoring of center Bill Martineau and the 
all-around play of sixth man Todd Smyser to gain control early. Edison opened a 
21-10 lead with 6:19 remaining in the second quarter when guard Tom Tyler made 
two free throws and Fountain Valley never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley was playing without starting forward Eric Zellmer and Vince 
Nguyen, a key reserve. Zellmer was injured in an automobile accident last 
weekend and didn't suit up. He was wearing a neck brace, and Billingsley said 
the senior is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lucky he wasn't seriously injured," Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was declared academically ineligible for the rest of the season. 
Earlier, Fountain Valley lost a key returning starter, Doug Weaver, when he had 
knee surgery after the football season. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley's depth problems were compounded when starting guard Doug 
Corcoran, the team's best outside shooter, fouled out with 5:21 remaining in 
the third quarter and his team trailing, 45-24. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost Corcoran, that sealed our fate," Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau led all scorers with 22 points and had eight rebounds before retiring 
to the bench with 2:20 remaining and his team leading, 56-36. Smyser added 12 
points, including a pair of three-point shots, and had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of up-and-down play out there, and I don't exactly know why," 
said Jon Borchert, the Edison coach. "Those were the same seven guys who were 
down by 21 points and beat Ocean View Saturday night. I still can't believe 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Marina 74, Huntington Beach 57 -- Cherokee Parks, who had 16 rebounds, scored 
13 of his game-high 34 points in the fourth quarter for visiting Marina (14-8, 
6-1). Brant Shelor had eight points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the 
Vikings. Mustapha Abdi had 15 points for Huntington Beach (8-13, 1-6). 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 69, Westminster 56 -- Ryan Martin had 16 points and Jim Gwaltney had 
15 to lead Ocean View (13-8, 5-2) over visiting Westminster (5-14, 0-7). Jim 
Harris had 11 points and seven assists for Ocean View. Jessie Gomez had 21 
points.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Feb. 24, 1980, the UC Irvine men's basketball team scored a school-record 
low eight points in the second half of a 30-26 loss to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Irvine scored 14 points in the first half of an 82-55 loss to 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the two games was that Irvine was trying to score against 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Tift, who coached the 1979-80 team, employed a number of slow-down tactics 
to give the overmatched Anteaters a chance to win against more talented teams. 
</P>
<P>
Tift said he had difficulty recruiting top-flight players, especially from the 
community college ranks, partly because Irvine had high academic standards and 
did not include majors such as physical education. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished that season 7-20 and lost a school-record 11 consecutive games 
in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Mulligan, the current Irvine coach, has varied his offense, but has not 
used a stall. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan also said he has difficulty recruiting top-flight players, especially 
from the community college ranks, partly because Irvine has high academic 
standards and does not include majors such as physical education. This despite 
a new, 5,000-seat on-campus arena that allowed Irvine to trade up from a home 
gymnasium unaffectionately called the Library. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has a 2-16 record this season, and, with the loss to Fullerton, tied a 
school record with 11 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
With a loss to Fresno State at 7:30 tonight at the Bren Center, Irvine will 
break that mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my family is rooting for Fresno State," said Tift, breaking into a 
wide smile. 
</P>
<P>
Tift, who resigned as Irvine coach with six games left in the 1979-80 season, 
is the school's acting athletic department chairman and a commentator on the 
Anteaters' radio broadcasts. He has spent the past week needling Mulligan about 
the losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been doing some research on the Anteaters' 1979-80 season, the 
worst in school history. In looking through old media guides, Tift discovered 
that UC Santa Barbara, which beat Irvine in the second game of the Anteaters' 
11-game slide, was forced to forfeit its victories that season for using 
ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, the streak's only 10 games," said Tift, who had a 141-152 record 
in 11 seasons as Irvine coach. "It's already broken. Technically we were 9-18 
that year. I can see the headline: 'Irvine was 9-18. Tift tells Mulligan to 
jump in a lake.' " 
</P>
<P>
But records kept by the Big West Conference and Irvine still list the 
Anteaters' record as 7-20. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1979-80 season began, Tift had been struggling to get the fledgling 
Division I program off the ground. The Anteaters, with only seven scholarships, 
less than half the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. limit, were handicapped 
from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine had been a Division I school for only two seasons, winning eight games 
in 1977-78 and seven the next season. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters -- who had some success at the Division II level, going 17-11 and 
qualifying for the NCAA Division II tournament in 1974-75 -- played in the 
quiet confines of 1,500-seat Crawford Hall, a.k.a. the Library. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters also found themselves playing in the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. 
(now the Big West), with an up-and-coming Fresno State program and strong teams 
at the University of the Pacific and Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Fullerton had been three points shy of beating Arkansas and reaching 
the Final Four. Twenty-victory seasons were still common for Long Beach in 
1979-80, which was 22-12 and reached the second round of the National 
Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Top to bottom, the conference was tougher than it is now, saving, of course, 
Vegas," Tift said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tift was optimistic, telling reporters before the season, "This program 
is moving forward and when it starts slipping backwards, I'll know it. That's 
when you'll find me selling footwear at Sears." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine managed a 6-6 nonconference record going into the conference opener Jan. 
10 at Long Beach. But soon, the Anteaters' fortunes began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who had two of the best players on the West Coast in forwards 
Michael Wiley and Francois Wise, routed the Anteaters, 77-46. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began an 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Feb. 16, the Anteaters upset Pacific, 63-60, at Crawford Hall. 
Irvine closed the season with four consecutive losses to finish with a 7-20 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Tift had resigned by then, frustrated that he couldn't keep pace with other 
conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got into Division I, in politely rapping the powers that be, they 
said, 'OK, we're in the league, now go get 'em,' " Tift said. " 'We know you 
haven't been given the wherewithal, but we think you can hang in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, Irvine did have a few good players, there just weren't enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Beal, a 6-foot-3 sophomore guard, led the Anteaters in scoring, 
averaging 14.3 points a game. Victor Conyers, a 6-8 senior forward, shot 60.4% 
from the field and still ranks ninth in the Big West in career field-goal 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, who had spent five seasons at Saddleback College, took over the next 
year and cleaned house. Of the holdovers from Tift's final team, only Beal got 
substantial playing time in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
With Kevin Magee, a two-time All-American center snatching headlines and 
rebounds by the fistful, the Anteaters were 17-10 in Mulligan's first season 
and 23-7 his second. 
</P>
<P>
Happily for Irvine followers, a new era had begun. Until this season, it has 
been far better than the old. 
</P>
<P>
"That team played to their potential," Tift said, defending his final team. 
"They played about as well as they could play. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to turn it over to the true basketball buffs and the players (of 
the 1979-80 and 1989-90 teams) as to who was tougher."

INJURY ENDS GYM CAREER, SO SHE HITS DIVING BOARD

<P>
As a sprite, acrobatic, and slightly accident-prone 6-year-old, Holly Powell 
realized that her athletic destiny lay somewhere between flipping and flying, 
crashing and crying. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until Powell, now a freshman at UC Irvine, took a tumble for the 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, Powell was swinging from a shower curtain, honing her 
new-found gymnastics skills. But the curtain came down, Powell crashed onto the 
tub and shattered her knee caps. 
</P>
<P>
The knee caps healed, but not without excessive bone formation, and continual 
stress and strain on her knee cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Although Powell became a Class 1 gymnast -- one level below the highest class, 
Elite -- the pain in her knees eventually caught up with her. At 16, despite 
years of physical therapy, Powell was told by doctors that she must either quit 
gymnastics or have surgery and switch to a more knee-friendly sport. 
</P>
<P>
She had the surgery and two months after removing her casts, Powell was leaping 
into a new athletic career: Diving. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want 10 years of gymnastics to go to waste," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell is one of the brightest stars on UC Irvine's diving squad. Although she 
has less than 1 1/2 years of experience, Powell has qualified in the one- and 
three-meter springboard events for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
regional championships March 9-10 at Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly is just one incredible athlete," Irvine Coach Conni Earley said. "Just 
within the last four or five months, her development has been tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Most credit Powell's background in gymnastics for her quick adaptation to 
diving. Body control and strength are attributes of each sport. Powell's 
power-packed frame -- she is 5-feet-2, 120 pounds -- gives her great leaping 
ability, especially helpful for platform diving. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a very powerful athlete, therefore she can do multiple somersaults," 
Earley said. "She's good at both twisting and spinning -- most divers can only 
do one or the other." 
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing Powell needs to improve, Earley said, it would be her 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
"Conni's always telling me, 'Holly, don't use your muscles so much. Think 
graceful. Pretend you're a ballerina,' " Powell said. "I guess I'll be taking 
ballet lessons sometime this year." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to addressing boosters and media on Monday about Irvine's search 
for an athletic director, Horace Mitchell, UCI's vice chancellor of student 
affairs and interim athletic director, said the university hopes to increase 
the number of athletic scholarships awarded each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we (offer) 65 scholarships, costing us $500,000 a year," Mitchell 
said. "Long term, we want to offer at least double that amount. We'd need $1 
million just to cover the scholarship cost." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the community surrounding the university has that kind of 
donation power. "The problem is, we're running our (fund-raising) campaign when 
our highlight sport (men's basketball) is not winning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler, the leading scorer on the men's basketball team, said Tuesday he 
seriously considered quitting the team recently. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, a 6-7 junior center, said his frustration hit a low after Irvine's 
latest two losses -- to UC Santa Barbara and Cal State Fullerton -- in which he 
scored two points in each game. Entering the Santa Barbara game, Butler was 
averaging 14.8 points a game. His current scoring average is 13.4. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said talks with his mother and close friends convinced him to continue 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just being positive, thinking positive and trying to do my best now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After only four matches, the Irvine women's tennis team is in dire straits. Of 
its 12 players, seven are either injured or ill. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Maggie Powers must wear a cast for most of the season because of 
tendon problems in her foot. She may redshirt this year. 
</P>
<P>
Returning No. 1 singles player Courtney Weischel, the team's only senior, 
hasn't played since April because of a recurring groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
Christi Bailey, a junior who hasn't played in the past two years because of 
injuries, is recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Michelle Foster of Mission Viejo has recovered from last fall's knee 
surgery but now has tendinitis in her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining players, one has a pinched neck nerve, one has low-grade 
pneumonia and one has tonsillitis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole litany of disasters," Coach Doreen Irish said. "Right now, we're 
kind of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Maria Akraka, the Swedish 800-meter star who transferred from Iowa State this 
month, will have to sit out the track season this spring because of an NCAA 
transfer rule, but she will be eligible to compete for Irvine in cross-country 
this fall, Coach Danny Williams said. Akraka likely will compete unattached at 
the Mt. SAC and Drake relays. . . . Sophomore Matt Farmer won the 20th Cal 
State Los Angeles decathlon with 7,031 points -- the best mark in the nation 
this year. Sophomore Marc Kallick, a former hurdles standout at Marina High, 
placed seventh (6,049) and senior Trindl Fearnley finished fifth in the 
heptathlon (4,579). . . . The men's tennis team, ninth in the Volvo 
Tennis/Collegiate rankings, play at No. 20 Arizona Saturday and Arizona State 
Sunday. Seniors Trevor Kronemann and Shige Kanroji will compete in the Rolex 
National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships Feb. 8-11 at Minneapolis. . . . 
The baseball team opened its season with a 13-6 loss to Loyola Marymount 
Tuesday. The Anteaters play at Cal State Los Angeles Friday, and play host to 
Chapman Saturday and UC Riverside Sunday. . . . Irvine's home swim meet 
Saturday against UNLV will start at 2 p.m., instead of noon as originally 
scheduled.

3 TO PAY $75,000 TO SETTLE INSIDER-TRADING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach businessman and two associates agreed Wednesday to pay more 
than $75,000 in penalties and profit forfeitures to settle federal charges of 
insider stock trading relating to the acquisition of San Diego-based Pancretec 
by Abbott Laboratories last year. 
</P>
<P>
Former Pancretec director Richard W. Dutrisac, John E. McCullough Sr. of 
Arlington, Va., and his son, John E. McCullough Jr. of Washington, agreed to 
the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission without admitting or 
denying guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Dutrisac, 50, who owns PFE Inc., a Newport Beach-based medical export company, 
received information regarding Abbott Lab's possible bid for Pancretec, a 
manufacturer of ambulatory drug pumps, in January, 1989, during Pancretec board 
meetings, the SEC charged in federal court in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He allegedly passed the information to his friend and business associate, 
McCullough Sr., who then bought Pancretec stock through his son, a Washington 
stockbroker. Two months later, on March 17, Pancretec publicly announced it had 
signed a letter of intent to be acquired by Abbott Labs, the giant Chicago 
pharmaceuticals company, for about $54 million or $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said McCullough Sr. purchased 4,000 Pancretec common shares through his 
son last Jan. 23 and March 7 in advance of the offer. McCullough Sr. also 
recommended to a friend that he buy Pancretec stock, and the friend bought 
1,000 shares. In addition, McCullough Jr. passed on the information to clients, 
who bought Pancretec stock based on his recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Dutrisac said he agreed to pay a civil penalty of 
$13,500 but denied having illegally profited from stock trades, or from 
knowingly passing on privileged information. Dutrisac agreed to the fines 
because it was the "least painful of the options" open to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I did anything wrong at all, but the SEC has a way of doing 
these things that if you want to fight it, to litigate would cost $75,000 to 
$100,000," said Dutrisac, a Santa Ana resident. "Frankly, I do not have that 
kind of cash or time, nor do I need those headaches." 
</P>
<P>
McCullough Sr. agreed to forfeit $17,500, and his son agreed to $13,884 in 
forfeitures. All but $822 of McCullough Jr.'s forfeiture was waived because of 
his inability to pay. Also, McCullough Sr. was fined $17,500 and his son 
$13,884, all but $4,177 of which was waived. 
</P>
<P>
Dutrisac said that at the period in question last year, he was speaking to 
McCullough Sr. up to 20 times per month to discuss business matters not 
involving Pancretec and that it was a coincidence that the McCullough stock 
purchases took place during that time. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Pancretec was purchased by Abbott, the company was growing rapidly 
with sales of its ambulatory drug pumps nearly doubling from the previous year 
to an annualized rate of about $12 million, a company source said. 
</P>
<P>
Dutrisac was employed at Baxter International from 1961 to 1979 in several 
management positions. He then left to start PFE, which primarily exports raw 
materials used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. He left Pancretec's board 
after the merger.

STIFF SENTENCES, FINES URGED IN S&amp;L FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top bank regulator has joined the U.S. attorney's office in Los 
Angeles in recommending long prison sentences and payment of millions of 
dollars in restitution and fines for two Orange County men convicted of causing 
the collapse of a Santa Ana savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office has recommended that John L. Molinaro and Donald P. 
Mangano Sr. -- former owners of Ramona S&amp;L -- receive 55 years in prison 
between them and pay a total $15 million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman appealed in a 
letter to U.S. District Court Judge David V. Kenyon to give both men a stiff 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I am particularly concerned that the sentences imposed upon Mr. Molinaro and 
Mr. Mangano reflect the seriousness of their crimes and serve to deter others 
from committing similar acts," wrote Seidman, who oversees failed thrifts as a 
member of the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In a sentencing memo submitted earlier this week, federal prosecutors said 
Ramona's collapse "typifies the unbridled greed and insider corruption that has 
so catastrophically harmed the savings and loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro and Mangano were both convicted in October on more than 30 counts of 
bank fraud and conspiracy and are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Kenyon on 
Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona was taken over by regulators in 1986 and subsequently required a 
$65.5-million bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision also sent a letter to Kenyon calling the 
Ramona case "one of the most egregious examples of insider abuse that have 
plagued the thrift industry during the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein has asked Kenyon to fine Mangano 
$1.5 million, order him to pay $6.8 million in restitution to the FDIC and give 
him a 30-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"From the moment he and Molinaro took over Ramona, Mangano's sole interest was 
to steal as much of Ramona's money and property as he could," Zipperstein said 
in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
Michael E. White -- Mangano's attorney -- said he was shocked by the 
prosecution's request. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the recommendations are outrageous; they're excessive," said White. 
"They are using Mangano as a scapegoat for the woes of the entire S&amp;L 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have recommended that Molinaro receive 25 years in prison and pay 
$7.8 million in fines and restitution. His attorney was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano, 53, of Huntington Beach, and Molinaro, 48, of San Jose, were found 
guilty of carrying out a complicated real estate scheme using Ramona's funds 
that was designed to enrich them personally. Prosecutors alleged in the 
sentencing memo that Mangano stole $11 million from the thrift and Molinaro 
more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect they pulled off an enormous heist of their own bank," Zipperstein 
said. "This case has once again demonstrated that a person with a briefcase can 
harm society much more than can a person with a gun." 
</P>
<P>
The Ramona case was the first criminal trial of owners of a failed savings and 
loan in Southern California.

ACTION SPORTS MOVES ITS TRADE EXPO ON SURF AND SKATE WEAR TO SAN DIEGO 
</P>

<P>
Wondering where to find the latest in boomerangs, skateboard hubcaps or shred 
wear (collars) for dogs and cats? Through Friday they're all at the Action 
Sports Retailer Trade Expo, which is the nation's largest collection of surf, 
skate and ski wear and snow-boarding apparel. 
</P>
<P>
Action Sports Retailer, the South Laguna firm that produces the trade show and 
magazine of the same name, is holding its semiannual show in San Diego this 
year for the first time, after 10 years in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The switch allowed Action Sports to add 66% more booths -- to a current total 
of 1,950 -- and 47% more exhibits, bringing the total to 900, said Brad 
Bonhall, senior editor of Action Sports Retailer. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that hasn't changed is the involvement of Orange County manufacturers 
-- about two-thirds of the exhibitors are locally based. And as always, the 
show is a must in terms of making sales for Orange County-based surf wear 
industry heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual exhibitors is California Sun Tattoos of Orange. The 
firm is just beginning to market "sun tattoos" -- stick-on decals of lips, 
scorpions, hearts, surfers and bats. The idea is to paste a decal on your arm 
or leg, go sit in the sun, and soon -- a sun tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
And Bagz, the Newport Beach firm that last year brought us lobster- and 
fish-shaped beach bags, is back with beach pillows with hidden Velco pouches.

FURON SELLS 3 ASSETS, GAINS $28 MILLION TOWARD DEBT

<P>
Furon Co. announced Wednesday that it has completed three separate asset sales 
worth a total of $28 million and that it will use the proceeds to reduce 
long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
Furon, a manufacturer of seals and plastic products, said it had sold its 
Reeves Rubber Division in Albertsville, Ala., to the British rubber company 
BTR. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel-based company also has negotiated the sale and lease-back of 
nine industrial facilities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Furon sold a South Carolina components factory, along with one of 
its product lines, to the French firm Carbon. The other three products from 
that facility will now be produced at a Furon plant in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Furon Chairman Peter Churm said the switch would increase employment in Los 
Alamitos by 10 to 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
Churm added that the asset sales were part of a "continuing process" aimed at 
reducing long-term debt, which stands at $114 million after the three 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The Reeves Rubber unit had revenues of about $10 million but was being battered 
by foreign competition and "didn't have much of a future," Churm said. BTR will 
use the facility to manufacture its own rubber molding products. 
</P>
<P>
The plants and land being sold and leased back were acquired by Furon through 
various acquisitions, Churm said. 
</P>
<P>
Churm declined to say how much of the $28 million total had come from each 
transaction.

COMMUTING BY RAIL OFFERS A FEELING OF CAMARADERIE AND A CHANCE TO RELAX

At 6:10 a.m., before dawn, John Garrett settles on a stool at the San Juan 
Saloon in San Juan Capistrano. Over coffee and a cigarette, he scans his 
newspaper while a lengthening row of men silently do the same beside him. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is a member of a pioneering breed, the Orange County rail commuter. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 commuters use Amtrak trains to make the morning trip northward, 
according to a new study by the Orange County Transit District. That hardly 
compares to the thousands of drivers on the road at that hour, but rail riders 
are a dedicated lot. 
</P>
<P>
The commuters -- mostly male professionals in their mid-40s -- endure 
occasional late arrivals and pay as much as $17.60 a day for a train ticket, in 
addition to travel expenses at their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, a chief scientist at Hughes Aircraft, has been riding Amtrak's San 
Diegan to Fullerton for seven years, ever since he moved to Southern California 
from Fort Worth, Tex. A major reason he chose to live in San Juan Capistrano 
was the train station, he says, adding, "Either I'm going to live across the 
street from where I work, or I'm going to take public transportation." 
</P>
<P>
By 6:30, the serenity of the San Juan Saloon has given way to preliminary 
socializing. Most of the 30 or so commuters in the saloon cluster near the bar, 
where coffee is served, continuing threads of conversations from the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
By the pool tables, Jim Mitchell and Bob Ross, co-chairmen of the month-old 
Amtrak Commuters Assn., huddle over a fistful of documents. The Capistrano 
commuters have become political animals since the city recently announced plans 
for a $2-per-day parking fee for the commuters. 
</P>
<P>
For Mitchell, an administrator for the downtown Los Angeles law firm of Hanna 
&amp; Morton, the parking fee seems particularly onerous. Both he and his wife, 
Joyce, have taken the 6:38 train into downtown L.A. for the last two years, but 
because they return on different trains, they must drive two cars to the 
station from their Dana Point home. The new charge would mean another $500 on 
top of the $4,000 each pays to ride the train to L.A. each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The commuters are the only ones (who will be) forced to pay a fee. That's 
discrimination," Mitchell insists. "If San Juan wants to project the image of 
fair-minded, ecologically concerned community, this isn't the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, a marketing manager at Hughes Aircraft, agrees that train commuters are 
being penalized for relying on a mode of transportation that government, from 
the local to the federal level, has declared environmentally desirable. 
</P>
<P>
A former fighter pilot, he has been riding the train for six years. "I've 
driven maybe three times in four years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In their first year in Orange County, Ross and his wife lived in La Habra. They 
decided there were too many people there and began scouting the coast for a new 
home. After six months they found what they wanted in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"I timed it during rush hour and said, this isn't going to work," Ross recalls. 
His wife suggested that he take the train. Ross says that at the time he didn't 
even know a train went through San Juan Capistrano, but he told his wife that 
if it did, he would take it. 
</P>
<P>
The crossing bell starts clanging at 6:37. 
</P>
<P>
The commuters empty out of the saloon as Amtrak's first northbound train of the 
day slows to a halt. By the time the six-car train stops, there are more than 
80 people lined alongside it. The Mitchells separate, Jim Mitchell heading for 
the smoking car while his wife opts for nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
The smoking car is always the next-to-last car on the train. The more 
gregarious of the smoking car commuters occupy a cluster of four seats that 
face each other at the front of the car. Martin Dimand, between greetings to 
the other commuters, sketches the social dynamics of commuting on Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
After traveling on the train daily for three years, Dimand, who lives in Laguna 
Beach, knows everyone in the smoking car. "What commuting has done is create a 
very loose association of contacts; you meet people that live in different 
cities, work in different cities and you talk with them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the daily train commute soon becomes routine, riders do occasionally 
celebrate in style. Every December they have a party aboard the train, chipping 
in $5 each for hors d'oeuvres and drinks. They decorate the car with lights, 
tinsel and signs wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the smoking-car commuters have developed a camaraderie 
extending beyond the daily train ride. When someone retires, they hold a party. 
Occasionally some will get together and go to a nightclub, and every few months 
as many as 18 of them will take the train to the Del Mar race track. 
</P>
<P>
People ride the rails to work because they don't want the aggravation of 
driving, Dimand explains. They also feel as if they're making an environmental 
contribution because they're not using their cars for long-distance travel. 
</P>
<P>
Dimand also notes that these are people who can be late to work on occasion 
without risking their jobs. He is the director of operations for the Charen 
Corp., a clothing manufacturer. It's extremely rare for him to drive to Los 
Angeles; he doesn't do it more than three times a year. He keeps a car at Union 
Station and pays $50 a month for a monthly pass for overnight parking. From 
Union Station it's a five-minute drive to work in the garment district, where 
he pays another $50 a month to park his car near his factory. 
</P>
<P>
While the train races through Irvine at 70 miles an hour, one of the regulars 
does a creative reading of the daily horoscope. Farther back, the more solitary 
types huddle over computers or papers, taking advantage of the free time to 
catch up on their work. 
</P>
<P>
From another set of four facing seats across the aisle, Dani Stevens leans over 
to say that she is a recent convert to the train culture and that what she 
found surprised her. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of a tool and die company in Placentia, Stevens had begun commuting 
by train only a week before, after moving to Oceanside. She was nervous on her 
first day taking the train, she says, but she found she was immediately 
welcomed into the group. 
</P>
<P>
Before relocating in Oceanside, her drive to work took 15 minutes from her home 
in Anaheim. Now her commute takes an hour and 15 minutes, but it's more 
peaceful, she says. Her boss sends someone to pick her up when she gets off the 
train in Fullerton. Although she is job hunting in Oceanside, she has enjoyed 
the train. 
</P>
<P>
After collecting more commuters in Santa Ana, the San Diegan arrives in 
Fullerton at 7:20. Commuters stream off the train while another 50 or so wait 
to climb aboard. Garrett and Ross disembark. Hughes supplies them with 
automobiles that they leave at the station overnight. 
</P>
<P>
As the train begins to roll again, Bob Sharp drops into one of the facing 
seats. Sharp, a vice president with Workmen's Auto Insurance Co. in downtown 
L.A., used to travel on the Chicago transit system. He is less forgiving of 
Amtrak's foibles than some of the other riders, but he also appears to enjoy 
his gadfly role in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"Service is totally inconsistent and unreliable," he pronounces. "We're 
reminded all the time that this isn't a commuter." 
</P>
<P>
His total travel time from his home in Yorba Linda is an hour and 20 minutes, 
if everything goes smoothly -- which he claims isn't often. 
</P>
<P>
Dimand disagrees. In his opinion, the trains run within 15 minutes of their 
schedule most of the time, and other commuters nearby nod in agreement. Sharp 
gives his cronies a look that says they're living in a pipe dream. They grumble 
about the picture he's presenting. 
</P>
<P>
Dimand does admit that the train occasionally is as much as an hour and a half 
late. Some of the delays are unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak is replacing track south of San Juan Capistrano, and that sometimes 
causes delays. When Amtrak warns of track work, commuter ridership drops off 
because people don't want to be late. 
</P>
<P>
If the train is running very late, Sharp catches an OCTD Park and Ride express 
bus that for $2 drops riders in downtown L.A., but he says it's crowded and 
uncomfortable and he prefers the train. 
</P>
<P>
The group in the smoking car agree that train service could be improved with 
the addition of more trains. "We need an earlier train, one that leaves 
Fullerton at 6:30 or 7 a.m," Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
Such a train would reach Union Station between 7 and 7:30, allowing commuters 
plenty of time to reach work by 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp also proposes an evening train that leaves later than the 5:50 but 
earlier than the last train, which leaves at 8:45. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the trip proceeds uneventfully, and at 7:55 the train slides into Union 
Station. The commuters flood from the San Diegan and hurry through the wide, 
dark halls of the station. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp walks a block and climbs aboard a city bus with Jim Mitchell. The RTD 
ride costs 90 cents. Mitchell gets off a half-mile away. Ten minutes after 
leaving the station, Sharp gets off two blocks from his office. In the evening, 
when he has more time, he takes Dash, a private commuter bus that costs 25 
cents and winds its way around downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, on the commute back to Orange County, the faces change a bit. 
Wine and mixed drinks replace the morning coffee. The daily crossword puzzles 
pass back and forth across the aisle, traded when somebody gets stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Dimand takes the 4:45 train, arriving home at 6:30. "Naturally, all this is 
predicated on the train being on time," he says. Still, to Dimand, the 
potential for delay is no greater than on the freeway, and there's an 
advantage. "When you get home at night, you're relaxed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
While the rail commuters' ranks are growing only slowly, that may not always be 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Fortune, public affairs officer for the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, plans are in the works to add a morning commuter 
train and an evening commuter to the schedule. These could operate at a cost to 
the commuter of 12 cents a mile, compared to the 20 cents a mile Amtrak 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The two trains could be in operation as soon as OCTC, Amtrak and the Santa Fe 
Railroad finalize their plans, and they could wind up attracting a whole new 
group of commuters who think the price and the schedule are right. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, despite the expense and the lengthened travel time, Orange County's 
rail commuters are still committed supporters of rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
As Bob Sharp says, "I drive to work only a couple of times a year. That's why I 
still have my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
WHO'S ABOARD 
</P>
<P>
Who rides Amtrak's San Diegan? 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transit District found the answer by conducting a survey of 
847 riders using its No. 571 and No. 573 northbound morning commuter trains for 
two days in mid-November. Half of the responses came from Orange County 
residents. The results: 
</P>
<P>
81% have professional or managerial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
58% are male. 
</P>
<P>
The average age is 43. 
</P>
<P>
69% have household incomes of $60,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
51% ride the train three or more days a week; 28% ride it every day. 
</P>
<P>
15% wanted better on-time train performance; 12% wanted more trains; 22% wanted 
added work space, and 11% wanted lower fares or commuter discounts. 
</P>

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE QUEST FOR NIXON QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hadn't been so excited since I caught my first foul ball at an Angel game two 
summers ago. There it was on the front page of The Times' Orange County 
section: a headline reading, "Nixon Library Unveils Plans for 'Face-to-Face' 
Dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
My mind boggled. Had Richard Nixon really mellowed out in his dotage 
sufficiently to answer the questions that have been fermenting within his 
fellow Americans for so many years? 
</P>
<P>
His life passed before me in Technicolor bursts. The Whittier football team. 
Helen Gahagan Douglas. Alger Hiss. The Checkers speech. The sweat and 5 o'clock 
shadow in his TV debate with John Kennedy. His campaign for governor of 
California (which I covered for the Christian Science Monitor) and the promise 
he didn't keep after his loss: "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." 
The tortured involvement in the Vietnam War. The China opening. The mindless 
fear of an opponent who could carry only two states. The arrogant accumulation 
of power ("I'm not a crook."). The pardon by Gerald Ford. The sense of his 
omnipresence ever since -- as if only a stake through the heart will ever 
eliminate Richard Nixon from the American political scene. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered vividly trips to pre-Watergate San Clemente as a reporter when I 
listened with awe to the White House press corps vilify him in private and 
canonize him in print. 
</P>
<P>
And those days and weeks of sitting glued to the TV set during the Watergate 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
I rushed to my desk. Questions. I had to come up with questions to ask him so I 
would be ready when the Nixon Museum opens next summer. I started listing them 
feverishly. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, of course: Why, oh why, didn't you destroy those tapes when 
it was still possible? 
</P>
<P>
Then, as fast as I could write, more questions came racing into my head: 
</P>
<P>
Did you really believe that Helen Gahagan Douglas was a communist? How about 
Alger Hiss? 
</P>
<P>
Was Checkers really your dog or did you just borrow him/her for that speech? 
</P>
<P>
Who advised you not to shave before the Kennedy TV debate? Where is he buried? 
</P>
<P>
Is it true -- or just a liberal canard -- that you wear a shirt and tie to bed? 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever visit any of your henchmen in prison? Have you acknowledged any of 
them since? 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't Pat write a book called "My Turn"? 
</P>
<P>
What is Henry Kissinger really like? 
</P>
<P>
Do you exchange Christmas gifts with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein? How about 
Gerald Ford? 
</P>
<P>
Things like that I've wondered about for years. There are dozens more, but 
these will give you the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Before I added to my list, it occurred to me that I should find out exactly how 
these question sessions would work, so I called designer Alex Cranstoun, who 
was identified in The Times story as the moving force behind the talking Nixon. 
I caught up with him in New York where his firm is headquartered, and he proved 
to be an affable, easygoing man. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that he didn't want to restrict the talking Nixon to a hundred or 
so stereotyped questions but wanted to open up the question process. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered the possibility of allowing any questions of the visitor's 
choosing, but we suspected that most of the Americans who visit the museum 
won't be that well-versed in American history so will need a little prompting." 
</P>
<P>
The prompting, says Cranstoun, will come from four columns of choices, with 
each column closing in more specifically on the subject. (One broad heading, he 
assured me, will be "Watergate.") The questions will be constructed from these 
prompting columns. 
</P>
<P>
Key words in the question will trigger a computer mechanism that will search 
among several thousand Nixon quotes for the most appropriate one. This process 
may take as long as five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the system will, in a sense, work backward. The designers will start with 
a broad array of Nixon quotes, then fashion the question columns to elicit the 
proper quote. 
</P>
<P>
Cranstoun said that if they find questions being asked that are not covered in 
the bank of responses, they may ask Nixon to add some fresh answers, "but the 
system we start out with will provide for a large variety of questions." 
</P>
<P>
He also said Nixon will probably have an opportunity to review the quotes 
selected "and I can't say he'll take them all, but so far there have been very 
few restrictions placed on us. However, it's certainly understandable that as 
long as President Nixon is still around, he and his family are going to want to 
be cast in the best light possible." 
</P>
<P>
I ran some of my proposed questions past Cranstoun, and I thought he sounded a 
little dubious. But he said, rather gallantly, that he would take them under 
advisement when he made up the list. He granted that the question about the 
destruction of the tapes -- or rather the lack thereof -- would probably be a 
popular one. 
</P>
<P>
The system will also capture the questioner's image on a screen as well as the 
President's. I'll admit it occurred to me that now that G. Gordon Liddy is out 
of jail and his road show with Timothy Leary has run its course, he may be 
holed up in a basement somewhere reviewing these pictures and putting out 
contracts on people who are asking the wrong questions. He never was one to 
stand on ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, I'm just going to have to take that chance. This is too good an 
opportunity to miss, even if the answers are programmed. After all, hasn't it 
been ever thus?

NON-POLLUTING COMMUTERS REAP CASH AND PRIZES 
</P>

Garden Grove.

<P>
Cycling, skating, running and walking -- the human-powered alternatives to car 
commuting -- are attracting a wide range of workers, especially those who are 
being rewarded by their companies to not drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
Incentive programs from cities and major corporations are aimed at reducing the 
number of people who drive. While most alternative commuters began cycling, 
skating and walking for health reasons, they now get incentives for reducing 
the number of cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach has a monthly contest -- with prizes 
including trips to San Diego via Amtrak -- for employees willing to try a 
different method of getting to work. To qualify, employees need to arrive in 
some way other than a solo commute at least three days a week. According to a 
recent survey, 76 employees ride their bikes to work on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be installing enclosed bicycle lockers that will enable 
(bicyclists) to ride their nicer bikes to work and not their 'beaters,' " said 
Janet Newton, commuter services administrator at McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Hanson, 32, a Douglas engineer and one of six women who rides a bicycle 
to work, won a three-day cruise to Ensenada during Ride Share Week last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Alternating skating with jogging and cycling, Douglas employee Chuck Denman of 
Belmont Heights "blades" to work along Westminster Boulevard on a pair of 
Rollerblades, a skate in which the four wheels are placed in one line along the 
length of the skate. The trip takes the "fortysomething" man 45 minutes on the 
in-line skates, 30 minutes on his bike and more than an hour when he jogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Commuting to work this way is being more efficient in your life style because 
you're getting to work and staying in shape at the same time," Denman said. 
Using modified ski poles, he gets a total body workout comparable to downhill- 
and cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"I get some emotional satisfaction knowing I'm not contributing to the (traffic 
and pollution) problem. It makes me feel better about myself," Denman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Spectrum business complex, between the Santa Ana and San Diego 
freeways, has its own transportation management association named 
Spectrumotion. Reducing traffic into the area through ride sharing, van 
pooling, walking and cycling is its goal, said executive director Charity 
Gavaza. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage every company that moves into Spectrum to install enclosed 
lockers or special rooms for bike storage," Gavaza said. "We also encourage 
companies to provide showers and lockers." 
</P>
<P>
The Spectrumotion Wheelers bike club sponsors lunch rides, bicycle fairs and 
lunchtime speakers aimed at promoting bicycle transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have over 200 people who are part of the Spectrumotion Wheelers with many 
of them riding their bikes to work at least on an occasional basis," Gavaza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group in Fullerton, eight of 9,000 employees 
commute on bicycles and 10 people walk to work on a regular basis. Showers and 
bike racks were installed at a cost of $78,000 to encourage participation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a larger number of seasonal cyclists who ride during daylight-saving 
time," said Dan Reeder, a spokesman for Hughes. "Many (cyclists) feel that 
riding after dark is just too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Safety is also a major concern of cyclists at Kawasaki Motors Corp. USA in 
Irvine, where about 15 of 310 employees ride their bikes to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a number of employees here who currently do ride their bikes and some 
who don't who have stated that if the roads were safer, they would bicycle 
commute more often," said Mark Nelson, personnel programs coordinator at 
Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in March, the city of Costa Mesa will offer a subsidy to city 
employees who bike or walk to work, said Kevin McCourt, employee transportation 
coordinator for Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The $40-a-month subsidy to full-time participants can be used to upgrade their 
walking shoes or bicycle equipment. Currently, out of 600 full-time employees, 
10 walk to work and 15 ride bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. George Yezbick, 44, of the Costa Mesa Police Department walks the 3.6 
miles from his home in Costa Mesa to the police station. His morning commute 
takes about an hour, although he admits he could speed it up if he stopped 
reading while he walked. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton city employees get one day off or $120 when they cut down the number 
of times they drive to work alone in a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief John Clark, 46, has been riding one of his three bicycles from 
his home in Westminster to Fire Station 1 in Fullerton for more than a year. "I 
was not quite as faithful about doing it (bicycle commuting) until the city 
came up with an incentive program. It was a challenge as much as anything." 
</P>
<P>
Clark now rides to work 80% of the time. When riding his racing bike, he can 
make the 15-mile trip in just 47 minutes. Driving his car gets him to work 12 
minutes sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"Station 1 has about 20 guys who ride to work on an occasional basis, some more 
faithfully than others," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than just physically fit firefighters who have taken to the streets 
on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Clark, 57, who co-owns Clark's Bicycle Shop in Westminster, cycles 10 miles 
to work each way from her home in Seal Beach. A member of the Orange County 
Wheelmen bicycle club and one of their trip leaders, Clark has been riding 
seriously for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are within 10 miles of your work, you should be (bicycle) commuting at 
least part of the time," said Clark, who qualifies her statement to exclude the 
people who live where it's impossible to ride without taking their lives into 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"City officials keep talking about building new highways to alleviate traffic 
problems. When they build a new street, if they'd include a bike lane, they 
would encourage more people to bicycle commute," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Harvey, 57, cycles to McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach from his home 
in Newport Beach. He has been cycle-commuting every day for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one bike hanging up in the garage, retired, with 80,000 miles on it. I 
have two other bikes with about 40,000 and 25,000 miles on them," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Bike Trails Committee for Newport Beach, Harvey is a vocal 
supporter of bicycle riding. He commutes daily along Pacific Coast Highway and 
is pushing for a bike lane on the highway, not just a bike trail that is shared 
with pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think cycling is a serious alternate to driving," said Harvey, who pedals 
his 20-mile commute in just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lytal, a 30-year-old computer programmer, started pedaling to work to beat 
the traffic, keep in shape and save money on gas. He can make the 9 1/2-mile 
trip from his home in Rancho Santa Margarita to Medstone International in 
Irvine in 20 minutes; that's only five minutes longer than if he drove. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes riding a bicycle saves time, especially if the rider uses short cuts, 
side streets and avoids intersections with long traffic lights. Jenny Vargas of 
Garden Grove and Andy Huey of Anaheim both get to work quicker on their bikes 
than in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just get on my bike and go," Vargas said. "Half the time I think I'm 
going to be late but I get there quicker than when I drive." 
</P>
<P>
Huey can make the one-mile ride to work in two minutes, often arriving before 
friends who are loyal car commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Lost love was the reason Bradley Quinby of Anaheim began cycling to work. After 
separating from his wife, Quinby, 24, gave up driving his car to save money on 
repairs, auto insurance and gas bills. "I haven't driven for a year," says 
Quinby, who works at Neil's the Bicycle Experience in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Also wheeling to work are Matt Harward, 17, and Scott Lindsey, 18, both from 
Fountain Valley, who ride their skateboards. Harward has been skateboarding two 
miles to Gremic Skates South in Huntington Beach for 1 1/2 years. The trip 
takes him 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey rode his skateboard to high school and for the past two years, he has 
been using it to cover the four miles to Little Caesar's Pizza in Fountain 
Valley where he works. "It saves money on gas," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Harward rides his skateboard because "sometimes I just feel like it. It's fun." 
The environmental benefits also are critical to this teen-ager, who says, "The 
environment is totally important."

TERRAMASTER ON COMEBACK TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
REVOLUTIONARY SPEEDSTER HAS BEEN PACKED AWAY FOR 25 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES F. QUEENAN, Charles F. Queenan is a Santa Ana-based free-lance 
writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most imaginative, ahead-of-its-time off-road vehicles, designed and 
built by a pair of Orange County men in the early '60s when the aging Jeep was 
the only American-made, four-wheel-drive vehicle available, never made it into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, that revolutionary prototype, which outperformed Mustangs, Corvettes, 
souped-up Thunderbirds and other high-performance cars in tests, languished 
unused in a Fullerton garage for over a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
Early last month, its creators -- entrepreneur/inventor Adolf Schoepe and 
racing car builder Harley Klentz -- resurrected their brainchild and began 
putting it back in running condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after 25 years we're still confident it can compete with any of these 
four-wheel-drives they're producing today, and even outperform them in some 
areas," Klentz said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepe first got the idea for a revolutionary new four-wheel-drive when his 
son Bob, then 10, became interested in off-roaders. Schoepe's entrepreneurial 
instincts envisioned such a recreational vehicle as the logical successor to 
the venerable Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jeep was a 30-year-old design by then and it did what it was supposed to 
do, but it was anything but comfortable," Schoepe explained. "I thought we 
could design a new four-wheel-drive that would do everything the Jeep could do 
and more, and give a much easier ride." 
</P>
<P>
Because he wanted to build some sports car characteristics as well as comfort 
into the new car, Schoepe sought an expert in competition car design. The 
search led to Klentz, who had been designing parts of racing cars since before 
he had a driver's license, including chassis for renowned kit-car builders Bill 
Devin and Don Garlits, and cars that challenged land-speed records on the 
Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two men spent a year kicking around suggestions on what their new 
creation should have. "We played together and I mean played," Schoepe recalled. 
"Whatever we decided to use, we just went ahead and found it or designed it." 
</P>
<P>
Among other features, the finished Terramaster, as they called their new 
four-wheel-drive, had a quick-change gearbox, Jaguar four-wheel inboard disc 
brakes, independent suspension, a vertical kingpin with total 
interchangeability, a center pivot on the wheel for easier steering, 
interchangeable front and rear axles, and shocks with springs mounted around 
them, then commonly used on motorcycles and sports cars but never before on a 
four-wheel-drive. 
</P>
<P>
At the time it was completed, highway safety tests for barrier crashes, tilts 
and braking capacity were being conducted at an abandoned Air Force base near 
San Bernardino. Klentz took the Terramaster there and tested it against the 
other high-performance sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could compare with the braking ability of its four-wheel inboard disc 
brakes -- half the distance of a Corvette with no slippage. Instead of the 
wild-and-woolly ride in a Jeep over rough terrain, the Terramaster's suspension 
enabled it to glide over a series of parking blocks with hardly a jolt. And it 
had the acceleration and top-speed firepower of a sports car. 
</P>
<P>
Production possibilities on a limited basis looked promising -- at first, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepe and Klentz figured they could build and sell the car for $5,000 to 
$6,000, while a survey reported that off-road enthusiasts and others in 
agriculture, forest service and similar pursuits would pay $10,000 for such a 
vehicle. "Great," they said, "now when can we get it." 
</P>
<P>
The initial plan was to build 100 to 200 units the first year. Schoepe began 
lining up American parts manufacturers while Klentz went to Europe and located 
places where some components could be produced at less cost than in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The project appeared ready to fly until consumer advocate Ralph Nader sued 
General Motors for alleged safety violations in its Corvair. Product liability 
insurance rates shot through the roof and prospects for producing the 
Terramaster took a sudden turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Lloyds of London, which insures almost anything for a price, would 
touch the car. One American firm finally agreed -- for a minimum of $100,000 
per year. That did it for Schoepe, who felt he already had enough money 
invested in the Terramaster and didn't want to go any deeper. 
</P>
<P>
The only possibility left was to have one of the big car makers produce the 
vehicle. The plans were sent to American Motors, which studied them for months 
before deciding that the Terramaster was a little too "drastic" for its product 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, Chevrolet came out with the Blazer and AMC bought the Jeep. 
Klentz drove the Terramaster around for awhile, then the car disappeared behind 
garage doors for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good idea and there definitely was a market for such a vehicle, but 
the timing wasn't quite right," said Schoepe, who knows something about timing. 
</P>
<P>
Being there with the right product at the right time has been the key to his 
remarkable business success, which is a classic story of the poor immigrant 
making good in the great American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepe arrived from Germany in 1927, seasick, penniless and unable to speak a 
word of English, but with a skill that America needed at that time. He was a 
master craftsman in metals just when the steel-making process had been 
perfected and the infant American aircraft industry was beginning to build 
airplanes with metal. 
</P>
<P>
He had no trouble finding work. He built aircraft for Curtis Robin in St. 
Louis, dirigibles for Goodyear in Akron, and the forerunner of the giant Boeing 
airliners in Seattle; overhauled and rebuilt aircraft at San Diego Naval Air 
Station; and taught metalwork to thousands of Rosie the Riveters for their 
valuable home front role during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
As the war was ending, Schoepe and a friend settled on a product they felt 
would be in widespread demand when home building was resumed. They founded 
Kwikset Lock Co. in Anaheim and made lock-and-key history. Another postwar 
building boom after the Korean War made Kwikset the leading lock set 
manufacturer in the country. 
</P>
<P>
When the company prospered, Schoepe discovered an idea for a revolutionary 
toilet tank repair valve. He sold his Kwikset stock and founded Fluidmaster 
Inc., also in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Again, timing was critical. The cost of calling in a plumber had risen and 
Schoepe saw a vast market for a simple do-it-yourself toilet tank repair valve. 
</P>
<P>
He was right again. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepe and merchandising wizard Fred Schmuck, who was in charge of marketing, 
build Fluidmaster into the leading manufacturer in its field. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamics that drive the 86-year-old Schoepe never seem to run down. He 
continues to put in 10-hour days at Fluidmaster, and has plenty of energy to 
join Klentz in bringing their 25-year-old experimental vehicle out of 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two men also are working out preliminary plans for the design of 
a futuristic internal combustion automotive engine. For that purpose, Klentz 
recently spent several weeks in England and Germany, studying a concept in 
aviation technology that was used effectively on aircraft before and during 
World War II but never in automotive engine design. 
</P>
<P>
While they offer few details, this project will address the problems of 
pollution and fuel economy, both of which have haunted the automotive industry 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"No need to worry about timing with that product," Schoepe says. "The engine 
that will help solve those problems can't arrive soon enough."

CHENEY PLANS FOR SOVIET PULLOUT IN EUROPE BY 1995 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is likely to pull all its troops from Europe by 1995, but the 
Western allies must remain wary of "the only nation on Earth capable of 
destroying the United States," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said President Bush's new proposal that Moscow and Washington seek 
agreement on deeper troop cuts in Europe than previously contemplated would 
"preserve . . . a viable, useful" American military presence on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Bush in his State of the Union speech Wednesday proposed reducing U.S. and 
Soviet combat forces in Europe 195,000 for each side -- a drop of 50,000 from 
the previous U.S. proposal at East-West troop reduction talks now under way in 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that with "communism crumbling" in Eastern Europe, the time had come 
to swiftly conclude agreements limiting conventional, strategic and chemical 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cheney said "caution 
is still in order" in considering relaxing U.S. defenses, even though Moscow is 
reducing its military spending and is unlikely to initiate an attack on NATO 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union remains the only nation on Earth capable of destroying the 
United States," Cheney said, adding that even if all Soviet troops leave 
Eastern Europe, Moscow would retain its geographic advantage in the event of a 
European crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said the Pentagon will present to Congress within a few months a 
revamped five-year plan for troop levels, deployments, weapons requirements and 
other strategic issues in light of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Among the assumptions used in this planning, he said, is that "the Soviets will 
be out of Eastern Europe or virtually out of Eastern Europe five years hence, 
that the governments of Eastern Europe will be democratically elected, 
non-communist regimes." He called this "a very real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said it was important not to drop below a certain troop level in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, 
sought and received an assurance from Cheney that the Administration would not 
consider going beyond Bush's latest troop-cut proposal in the foreseeable 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in strategy," Warner 
said.

<P>
Mayor David N. Dinkins, after only a month in office and faced with a giant 
budget deficit, said today he would raise taxes by $550 million and cut city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time for tough choices. . . . We have not entered a recession -- not 
yet anyway -- but these are very hard times indeed," Dinkins said as he 
unveiled a $27.8-billion budget, highest in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, the city's first black chief executive, is facing a projected 
$1.2-billion deficit for the fiscal year starting next July 31 and a 
$400-million gap for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins proposed raising property and city income tax surcharges by $550 
million. He said he will also cut city services by $226 million to help close 
the gap. Additional measures such as savings through increased productivity 
will also be aimed at closing the budget gap.

New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan said today he would leave his post 
at the helm of the nation's largest stock exchange at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference after the market closed this afternoon, Phelan, 58, said 
"perhaps there was another career out there for me. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty is a good time to make a transition." 
</P>
<P>
Phelan is a Wall Street insider who once ran a specialist floor-trading firm. 
He was at the helm of the stock exchange through some of its most turbulent 
times, including the October, 1987, stock market crash and the probes of 
computer program trading blamed for volatile swings in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
He became chairman in 1984. Asked what he planned to do once he leaves, he 
noted he has 11 months to consider the issue and has come to no decision about 
his future. 
</P>
<P>
There had been rumors on Wall Street that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady 
would resign his post and that Phelan might be nominated to take his place. But 
the White House said the Brady resignation rumors were not true.

HAKIM GETS PROBATION, $5,000 FINE; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA FIGURE GIVES UP $7.3 MILLION MADE IN SALES OF ARMS

A federal judge today placed Iran-Contra figure Albert Hakim on two years' 
probation and fined him $5,000. The businessman who controlled the money in the 
scandal agreed to hand over to the U.S. government $7.3 million from the secret 
arms sales to Iran frozen in Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell imposed probation following Hakim's 
Nov. 21 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of helping to supplement Oliver L. 
North's government salary by arranging to pay for a $13,800 security system at 
North's home. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public has had enough of this soap opera," Hakim said outside the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been abused by two Presidents," he said. "I'm talking about President 
Reagan and President Walsh," a reference to independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh, who directed Hakim's prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim is another in a string of Iran-Contra defendants who have escaped prison 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Very substantial funds -- measured in the millions of dollars -- which have 
been frozen" in Swiss bank accounts "have now been released to the United 
States by you," Gesell announced in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Walsh said Hakim will retain $1.7 million, which he will 
split with his Swiss-based lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell also said the Iranian-born Hakim had secured the release of David 
Jacobsen, a U.S. hostage held in Lebanon, and is cooperating with Iran-Contra 
prosecutors in a new criminal investigative matter. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell noted that Jacobsen, the former hostage, had written the judge on behalf 
of Hakim. The judge said that while others "have taken credit for" freeing the 
hostage, it was Hakim's conduct that actually achieved it. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Justice Department, the Swiss government froze about $7.8 
million held in accounts of the "Enterprise," the maze of offshore companies 
and bank accounts Hakim and his business partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. 
Richard V. Secord, set up to handle money in the Iran-Contra affair. The money 
has accrued about $1.2 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim's lawyer, Richard Janis, said the prosecution of Hakim was "an abuse. 
After 22 months of indictment and expenditure of $100 million, they brought an 
indictment that no other prosecutor would have taken to court." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell called Hakim's assistance to Iran-Contra prosecutors "exceptional" and 
"in sharp contrast to any other of the defendants who have been at one time or 
another before me in . . . the Iran-Contra . . . case." 
</P>
<P>
The judge was referring to North, Secord and former National Security Adviser 
John M. Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the only one who . . . was not an officer or former officer of the 
U.S. government," the judge said. "Indeed, you were brought (into the affair) . 
. . by the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that Hakim's business interests have been hurt and that "you 
have suffered substantially."

The four blacks who were denied service at an all-white Woolworth lunch counter 
30 years ago were greeted today by a black Woolworth vice president before 
sitting down to a breakfast of eggs, grits, bacon and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Jibreel Khazan and Joseph McNeil entered the 
store at 7:30 a.m. and, surrounded by dozens of reporters and onlookers, 
ordered from two women who had worked there on Feb. 1, 1960. Three of the men 
wore business suits. Khazan, formerly Ezell Blair Jr., wore a white robe with a 
headband around his dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
They were greeted by Woolworth Vice President Aubrey Lewis, who noted that 30 
years ago he would also have been denied service. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud you had the courage to open the doors for a movement," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
While the four waited for their meals, some onlookers began singing "We Shall 
Overcome." Outside the store there was more singing directed by the NAACP, and 
some bystanders carried placards saying, "Feb. 1, 1960. It seems like only 
yesterday, but it could be tomorrow" and "The only thing that's worthwhile is 
change -- Remembering Feb. 1, 1960." 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1960, public buildings in Greensboro had separate water fountains for 
whites and blacks. Theaters had separate entrances for blacks, who were forced 
to sit in balconies, away from whites. Blacks had to step to the rear on city 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
When the four, all freshmen at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, refused 
to leave the counter 30 years ago, their sit-in touched off protests in nine 
states and helped ignite the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared," McCain recalled. "I just wanted a Coke and a doughnut. That's 
all I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
"We did get some encouragement on the first day, and we got it from quarters 
you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to come from," he said. "There was a little 
old white lady of oh, 75 years of age, who came over and placed her hands on 
our shoulders and said to us, 'Boys, I'm so proud of you. The only thing I 
regret is that it didn't happen 20 years earlier.' 
</P>
<P>
"That was really a source of inspiration to us." 
</P>
<P>
The four had been prepared to go to jail, but police allowed them to go back to 
school.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today that after nine years close to 
Washington's power center, he has found that "power doesn't really bring the 
fulfillment that many think it does." 
</P>
<P>
Baker told a roomful of politicians and diplomats at the annual National Prayer 
Breakfast that "inner security and true, real fulfillment comes by faith. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't come by wielding power in a town where power is king." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he used to think that being a success meant never admitting hurt or 
problems, but that changed several years ago. He said that at that time he was 
having a particularly difficult problem and that his wife, Susan, helped him 
pray and see that "I really needed to stop trying to play God and turn the 
matter over to faith."

BUSH PLAN TO TRIM TROOPS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, SOVIET OFFICIAL SAYS

President Bush's proposal for deeper troop cuts in Central Europe was a step in 
the right direction, but it failed to go far enough, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Gennady I. Gerasimov said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise overture, Bush proposed in his State of the Union message 
Wednesday a cut in military manpower in Europe to 195,000 troops on each side. 
The previous U.S. bargaining position at conventional force negotiations in 
Vienna was 275,000 on each side. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Bush speech was) a good sign that things are changing for the better," 
Gerasimov said at a news briefing. "Some observers note that the events in 
Europe run ahead of the slow diplomatic negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov criticized the proposal for not going far enough. "You can note in 
his speech that he needs American troops in Europe from here to eternity -- 
125,000 or about this figure. This is not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
"We, together with Les Aspin (chairman of the House Armed Services Committee), 
feel it must be the ceiling, not the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his speech that he and the United States' European allies agree 
"that an American military presence in Europe is essential -- and that it 
should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also complained that the proposal applies only to troops in Central 
Europe and would leave the United States with 30,000 or more troops in Britain, 
Greece and other countries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"So it comes out that the U.S. is to have 235,000 troops," Gerasimov said. This 
will have to be considered at the conventional arms talks in Vienna, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also complained that Bush seemed to take credit for the "revolution 
of 1989," as the U.S. President called it. 
</P>
<P>
He said attempts to show these events as a triumph of American ideals and a 
failure of communism "are a relic of the Cold War." He added that the U.S. 
invasion of Panama was further evidence of this attitude. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush said that the remarkable events of 1989 "validate the 
longstanding goals of American policy -- a policy based on a single, shining 
principle: the cause of freedom. America -- not just the nation -- but an idea, 
alive in the minds of people everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, Gerasimov repeated that "we want to see in Bush's address a 
signal to use to the maximum the unique chance of 1990 to improve 
Soviet-American cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also said the Soviet government objects strongly to the fact that 
Cable News Network continued to broadcast a report alleging that Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was considering quitting as Communist Party 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the station kept putting the report out even after Gerasimov and 
Gorbachev on Wednesday said it was untrue and based on rumor.

The heir to a textile fortune was sentenced today to 150 days in prison and 
five years probation for molesting two youngsters at a Blue Ridge Mountains 
summer camp for rich kids. 
</P>
<P>
John Yorke Pharr III, grandson of a founder of Stowe-Pharr textile mills, was 
sentenced to five years in prison, suspended on the condition that he serve 150 
days in state prison followed by five years of supervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
Pharr, 41, continued to insist he is innocent of charges that he took indecent 
liberties with minors attending Camp Falling Creek, a summer camp for 
privileged children that Pharr owned in Tuxedo, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Four children testified against Pharr during his trial, each telling nearly 
identical accounts of being taken on skinny dipping outings and then invited to 
share his sleeping bag, during which they said the molestations occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Pharr said he shared his sleeping bag with the youngsters, who were each 10 
years old, because they were homesick.

Buyers from West Germany and the United States have offered a Czechoslovak town 
more than its asking price for a statue of Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
The CTK news agency said today that four buyers have bid for the 12-foot 
statue, advertised last week in a West German newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
CTK said buyers are prepared to pay more than the $50,000 asking price. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was put in storage during the 1968 Prague Spring reforms but 
reappeared after the Soviet-led invasion. It was removed again in December.

Boeing Co. today picked up another $1 billion in business with jetliner orders 
from Japan Air System Co. and Qantas Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Air System ordered four Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets and took options for 
four more, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said. 
</P>
<P>
Qantas ordered one 747-400 and four 767-300 wide-body jets, worth about $560 
million, including spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
The firm orders by JAS are worth more than $520 million, and the total package 
will be worth more than $1 billion if the options are exercised, Boeing said. 
</P>
<P>
The order represents the first placed with Boeing by JAS, Japan's third-largest 
airline and formerly a domestic-only carrier. 
</P>
<P>
JAS will specify engine types at a later date. Qantas chose Rolls-Royce engines 
for its new 747 and General Electric engines for its 767s. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year customers have ordered 67 Boeing jetliners, valued at about $6 
billion.

Hilton Hotel Corp.'s stock price dropped sharply today after its board ended a 
meeting without announcing any plans to sell or restructure the lodging and 
casino company, as some speculators had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton shares fell $4.75 to $57 in early trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
After the board's regular meeting on Wednesday in Beverly Hills, Hilton said 
today the board asked its financial advisers and management to further review 
acquisition bids as well as alternative plans and to report back to the board 
within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The company reiterated that there is no assurance it will pursue any 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Hilton has gone on wild price swings since the company put itself 
on the auction block last August, trading at a high of $115.50.

BRADY URGES FAMILY SAVINGS PLAN

<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady today urged Congress to adopt President 
Bush's proposed tax-free Family Savings Account as a way to boost America's 
competitive standing in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, appearing before the Senate Budget Committee to promote the tax aspects 
of the President's 1991 budget request, said the Administration feels strongly 
that the new savings accounts, along with a proposed cut in the capital gains 
tax, will foster the long-term investment needed by U.S. businesses to stay 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Savings Account, which Bush mentioned in his State of the Union 
address, would allow an individual taxpayer to save up to $2,500 a year and a 
family to invest up to $5,000 a year with the money earning interest tax-free 
as long as it is held at least seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration sees this proposal as the centerpiece of an effort to 
increase personal savings rates and thus expand the pool of money available for 
businesses to borrow to modernize production facilities.

BAND DIRECTOR A LONG WAY FROM THUNDER BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON KENT, THE BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, just how did a Jewish kid like Paul Shaffer from decidedly un-hip Thunder 
Bay, Ontario, Canada, become one of the hippest cats in America? 
</P>
<P>
As the lovable nebbish who is David Letterman's band director on "Late Night" 
tells it, it was the drifting of radio airwaves across the border from the 
United States to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing much going on for a kid at that time, except for a lot of 
cold, bad weather. When I discovered that I could tune into American radio 
stations after dark, this was the hippest thing to me. It sort of saved my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Shaffer, who has headed Letterman's four-piece band for the eight 
years that "Late Night" has been on the air, said the music from stations in 
Chicago and Little Rock, Ark., were instrumental in his musical appreciation. 
After playing keyboards with local nightclub bands in Thunder Bay, Shaffer 
landed a job playing piano in the Broadway musical, "The Magic Show." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Shore, then musical director of "Saturday Night Live," hired Shaffer to 
play in the show's band. He also saw some acting time on "SNL," doing an 
impersonation of music impresario Don Kirchner and acting as accompanist in 
Bill Murray's lounge singer numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer served as music director for "The Blues Brothers" band for their 
national tour and two albums. He has also recorded with artists as diverse as 
Diana Ross, Yoko Ono and Bonnie Tyler, as well as serving as co-writer of the 
Weather Girls' "It's Raining Men." But it is clear that Shaffer's largest share 
of fame has been derived as Letterman's second banana, a role he clearly 
relishes. "I'm pretty realistic. It's not a musical show. It's not my show, 
where I could show off my band. We've all had a pretty gratifying experience." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Shaffer's first solo album, "Coast to Coast," a sort of tour of 
American popular musical styles, has done well, and the "Late Night" theme, 
which Shaffer included on the album reluctantly, has been nominated for a 
Grammy award.

A High Court judge awarded $422,000 in damages to a stunt man who claimed his 
career was ended by injuries caused in a fall during the filming of the movie 
"Superman IV." 
</P>
<P>
London Cannon Films Ltd. admitted liability. But John Lees, 47, said the award 
does not make up for the injuries he suffered when harness wires snapped and he 
fell 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"My career as a stunt man is over," said Lees, whose heels and left ankle were 
broken. He was unable under British law to specify to the court how much he 
wanted in damages. His lawyer told the court that Lees has undergone surgery 
and physiotherapy but is permanently disabled.

Rock star Prince's fondness for macaroni and cheese and canned cake frosting 
was too much for his chef, who quit after only a month on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He eats a lot of junk food. 
</P>
<P>
I have the feeling it's going to catch up with him," Carmen Bonilla of 
Minneapolis said Wednesday of the svelte Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, 36, a professional chef for 10 years, said she began working for 
Prince just before Christmas. Her last day on the job was Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't had the opportunity to develop his palate," Bonilla said of the 
reclusive rock star. "He doesn't eat out very much because he's shy and he 
hates the public. . . . He wants the comfort food he grew up on." 
</P>
<P>
That means macaroni and cheese and cake mixes and canned frosting, said 
Bonilla, who prefers cooking Mediterranean cuisine. "Basically it was too 
restrictive for me as a personal chef," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he professes to be a vegetarian, Prince will not eat salads and 
vegetables but he will eat chicken, likes fresh fish and "adores" pasta, 
Bonilla said.

Jazz guitarist George Benson gave a pep talk to a would-be musician suffering a 
rare form of cancer. Then he backed up the kind words with a valuable gift. 
</P>
<P>
When 22-year-old David Romito talked with Benson after a show here last fall, 
it gave him hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Benson talked with me a long time," Romito said this week. "He knew I was 
sick, of course, and said he knew somebody who once was given only six weeks to 
live -- and the person is still living 10 years later." 
</P>
<P>
Romito admired Benson's guitar, a six-string Ibanez, and the singer offered to 
send him an identical one. The instrument arrived at Romito's home last month, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Romito plays guitar, sings and writes music. He was diagnosed in 1985 with 
rhabdomyosarcoma, a muscular cancer but said he is continuing to focus on his 
musical career.

Andy Griffith credits a grammar school performance and his hatred of being 
laughed at as the impetus for his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was laughed at all the time" as a child, the 63-year-old actor said in an 
interview in Parade magazine for next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled an instance during a third-grade play that made him realize that he 
could make people laugh with him, instead of at him. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered that I could control why they laughed by doing something overt to 
make them laugh," Griffith said. "I was being laughed at, I hated it, so I made 
an adjustment to control the situation. All comics learn that." 
</P>
<P>
The result was a successful career that included eight years as Mayberry's 
lovable sheriff on "The Andy Griffith Show," a host of specials and most 
recently "Matlock," a series in which he plays a lawyer who always gets his 
clients off the hook.

The city of Atlanta put its best foot forward as it took the next in a long 
series of steps in the tough competition to host the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
City officials presented a detailed proposal to the International Olympic 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city is among the front-runners for the Olympics, along with Toronto; 
Melbourne, Australia, and Athens. The host city will be selected in September 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
William Payne, president of the Atlanta Organizing Committee, presented the 
city's proposal in five bound volumes, gave a 6 1/2-minute speech, answered a 
couple of questions and dropped off a $100,000 entry fee check. The Atlanta 
proposal calls for the Games to be held July 20 to Aug. 4, 1996, and projects a 
profit of $156 million on spending of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The cities will make presentations again in Tokyo.

The owners of a nightclub allegedly vandalized by bat-wielding Marshall 
University football players last weekend will not press charges against the 
men, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they've made arrangements with the school," Chief Deputy C. A. 
Adams of the Cabell County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've closed the case." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 men, many of them Marshall football players, forced their way into 
DeSoto's nightclub early Saturday and used sticks and bats to smash tables, 
chairs and the bar's namesake, a 1956 DeSoto, after one of them was ejected 
from the club, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the nightclub manager had reached an agreement with Marshall 
Athletic Director Lee Moon under which the players involved, including two 
starters on last year's team, would lose their football scholarships and make 
restitution for more than $2,500 in damages to the club.

The chief negotiator for baseball's owners said today that spring training 
camps will not open unless both sides agree on an outline for a new collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' Player Relations Committee, made 
the statement in response to a question at the end of a nearly two-hour 
briefing for reporters on the proposal being pushed by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
The first players are scheduled to report for spring training Feb. 15. Asked 
what would happen if there is no agreement by then, O'Connor said 
unequivocally, "The camps will not open." 
</P>
<P>
After the briefing, the union and management began their 15th negotiating 
session in an effort to replace the contract that expired Dec. 31. The sides 
had met Wednesday without progress as the owners continued to argue in favor of 
their revenue-sharing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little frustrated with it," union Executive Director Donald Fehr said 
after Wednesday's three-hour session. "Their strategy is to talk about their 
stuff. It's clear they are not of a mind to seriously discuss the players' 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
The sides are to negotiate three more times next week before owners meet in 
Chicago on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Management's plan calls for the players to get 48% of the revenue from ticket 
sales and broadcast contracts. The proposal is tied to a pay-for-performance 
plan that calls for players with fewer than six years in the major leagues to 
be paid according to statistical formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The owners withdrew their proposed change in the collusion language that would 
have made it harder for the union to prove its cases. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said the union's proposals on economic issues did not get any "meaningful" 
response, but he emphasized that the talks still are at an early stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The season is not going to be canceled tomorrow, I hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The players are asking that the minimum salary rise from $68,000 to between 
$100,000 and $125,000, that the service time for salary arbitration be reduced 
from three years to two, that team rosters go back to 25 players from 24 and 
that draft-pick compensation for certain free agents be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not willing to agree to any of the suggestions we've made," Fehr said. 
"The reason, they say, is cost, but they can't quantify the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Owners say they need revenue sharing because they fear there will be a gap in 
income between teams from large and small cities. But they have been unable to 
tell the union when they think it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for the rationale," Fehr said, adding that the owners' inability 
to pinpoint their problem "does take the urgency off it."

EAST GERMAN SKATER WINS WOMEN'S TITLE

Evelyn Grossmann, who comes from Katarina Witt's hometown, stamped herself as a 
successor to the East German star by coming from behind to win the women's 
title at the European Figure Skating Championships today. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmann, 18, beat a nervous Natalia Lebedeva of the Soviet Union, who led 
going into the final free program, but fell three times and dropped to second. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Kielmann of West Germany took third place. 
</P>
<P>
In other events today, Czechoslovakia's Petr Barna moved in to a narrow lead in 
the men's event after the original program, while world champions Marina 
Klimova and Sergei Pononomarenko took command in the ice dance competition. 
</P>
<P>
In a lackluster women's final, Grossmann had just enough to edge Lebedeva, who 
was trying to become the first Soviet woman to win an individual crown. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Grossmann became the fifth East German woman to take a European title, 
following Witt, Annett Poetzsch, Christine Errath and Gabriele Seyfert. 
</P>
<P>
Skating to "Slaughter on 10th Avenue", Grossmann landed four triple jumps 
cleanly. She earned marks of 5.4 to 5.7, which were good enough to take the 
free program. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmann was seventh in the European championships last year. Claudia Leistner 
of West Germany, who has since turned pro, won in 1989. But Witt took the crown 
six times before that. 
</P>
<P>
"I am astounded I won the championship," Grossmann said. "I just came here 
hoping for a medal."

TEAM PROBABLY WON'T PROTECT DOUG WILLIAMS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: MVP OF '88 SUPER BOWL MAY BECOME A PLAN B FREE AGENT. BRONCOS' 
CLARENCE KAY AND STEELERS' TODD BLACKLEDGE ALSO MAY NOT BE PROTECTED.

<P>
Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, the Most Valuable Player in the 
1988 Super Bowl, was expected to be missing from the team's 37-man protected 
list submitted to the NFL today. 
</P>
<P>
Other players who might become Plan B free agents are starting tight end 
Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback 
Todd Blackledge. As Plan B free agents, the players would be free to negotiate 
with any team or re-sign with their present team. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 34, would have earned $1.2 million this season. If he chooses to stay 
in Washington, the team would not be obligated to pay him the salary he would 
have earned were he kept on the protected list. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins will not release their list of protected players until Friday, a 
team spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who threw for four touchdowns and 340 yards in Washington's 42-10 
victory over Denver in the Super Bowl XXII, has said he is "positive" that he 
will be excluded from the Redskins' list of protected players. He saw limited 
playing time last year because of a back injury and finished the season clearly 
the No. 2 quarterback behind Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, Kay said Wednesday that Broncos coach Dan Reeves told him "don't be 
surprised" if his name showed up on the team's Plan B list. 
</P>
<P>
All NFL teams were to submit today a list of 37 protected players to the league 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Kay, a starter the last six seasons, said he thought there was a 50-50 chance 
he would be exposed to Plan B free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Bronco veterans who are likely prospects for Plan B are running back 
Sammy Winder and offensive guard Keith Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Todd Blackledge's contract expires 
today, and the Steelers will not offer him a new one, according to a published 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers planned to begin their search for a replacement for Blackledge 
today when several coaches and scouts were to work out former Green Bay 
quarterback Randy Wright at the University of Wisconsin, the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackledge was the Steelers' backup quarterback for two years. Except for him, 
most of those left unprotected probably will be invited to training camp by the 
Steelers if they do not sign with another team. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Bengals place-kicker Jim Breech said he expects to be one of the 
team's unprotected players because the team knows he doesn't want to leave the 
Cincinnati area.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BASEBALL PLAYERS MAY BE UNDERPAID

<P>
So your head spins every time you think of how much money major league baseball 
players are making. 
</P>
<P>
You say these players have lost touch with reality when it comes to judging 
their true value. 
</P>
<P>
You share the popular notion that these grown men are playing a kid's game and 
should be grateful they get to spend their summers lounging in the sun, doing 
what the rest of us mortals only wish we could do for money. 
</P>
<P>
Well, let's put aside emotions for a while and examine the cold, hard facts. 
You may be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
You may learn that, if anything, baseball players are underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, baseball owners, most of whom are shrewd businessmen, toss money at 
their players the way we toss a sawbuck to our kids for their weekly 
allowances. It's as if each day another player becomes the highest paid in 
baseball. It was Will Clark's turn recently. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it may be some other guy. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't as if the owners don't know what they're doing. They know exactly 
what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason they do it is simple, really. 
</P>
<P>
Without the players, the owners wouldn't be making their astronomical profits. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that, as a group, the players are earning a perfectly 
reasonable percentage of what they generate. And the owners know it. 
</P>
<P>
This is easily detectable when one figures out the way the baseball pie is 
sliced. 
</P>
<P>
The 624 men on the rosters of baseball's 26 major league clubs generate about 
five times as much money as they earn. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the four-year, $1.5-billion total contracts that baseball signed with 
CBS and ESPN. That alone brings in $375 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Let's conservatively estimate that local television and radio contracts bring 
in another $150 million a year for the 26 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
And let's say gate receipts bring in an additional $685 million a year, based 
on 81 home games and average attendance of 25,000 spectators, paying an average 
of $13 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Concessions, programs and other such income producing devices bring in another 
$316 million, based on $6 a fan. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the clubs together earn about $100 million or so in merchandise 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
All told, these 624 men, who together are major league baseball, will generate 
$1.65 billion in gross revenue for the owners. 
</P>
<P>
That, on average, means each player is responsible for generating about $2.6 
million in direct revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that to the $550,000 or so that the average major leaguer will earn in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball still ranks very much as an owner's market. 
</P>
<P>
So why do the salaries of baseball players cause so much controversy? 
</P>
<P>
It probably has more to do with their public images than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Gripes from Joe Consumer, after all, aren't nearly as frequent about the 
salaries of entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
It is uncommon to hear people saying that Dolly Parton, Tom Cruise or Sammy 
Davis Jr. make outrageous sums of money. Jack Nicholson will make more than $60 
million for his role as the Joker in "Batman." And some of us didn't even 
consider it a very good movie. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's generally accepted that these performers paid their dues to reach 
the salary levels they enjoy today. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players, however, are generally perceived as spoiled and pampered 
prima donnas. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that most baseball players resemble overaged adolescents -- 
and we all know that adolescents with a lot of money can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players are likely to fight among themselves. They whine about their 
playing time, or which positions their managers want them to play. Some develop 
never before revealed injuries to explain their ways out of slumps. And a few 
only seem to produce in the option years of their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, baseball players have been known to directly insult the 
very fans who pay their bills, advising in some cases that they kiss their 
wallets. 
</P>
<P>
Some players are not averse to reminding Joe Consumer that, in the world of 
baseball, beating rush-hour traffic means getting out of bed at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how much the players irk the fans, however, the truth is that the 
game is adored. 
</P>
<P>
And that translates into sizable crowds and revenue in most major league 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
And that, in turn, means the players have incredible bargaining leverage -- 
like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that salaries in baseball probably will continue to rise. 
And, until these players grow up to be the role models that society thinks they 
should be, so will the fan's blood pressure.

STEINBRENNER SAYS FANS WILL BALK AT SALARIES

<P>
George Steinbrenner, the man who built World Series champions in the late 1970s 
with pricey free agents, agrees with other baseball owners on one subject -- 
that players' salaries are getting too high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just getting crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked? Yes. Certainly," the New York Yankees owner was quoted in the New York 
Daily News. "How can you pay a ballplayer 3, 3 1/2-million dollars a year when 
the head of the Chiefs of Staff is making just $77,000 a year?" 
</P>
<P>
"Some way, somehow, someone has to say, 'Stop! Whoa!' Can one man make a 
$3-million difference in a ballclub. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees do not have a $3-million player yet, although Don Mattingly is 
entering the final season of a three-year contract and would like an extension 
for at least that much. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees did, however, sign free agent Pascual Perez to a three-year, 
$5.7-million contract. Perez was 9-13 for Montreal last season and is 64-62 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner predicted the fans will eventually rebel against the higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be the cab drivers or the cops," he said. "The fans. They'll 
say, 'enough is enough.' They'll realize a ballplayer will make more in one 
year than him and 10 of his friends will make in their lives."
