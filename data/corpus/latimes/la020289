BETTER THAN GRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The implicit deal that had been struck to raise congressional and other top 
federal salaries seems to be in some danger of dissolving under a shower of 
cold political sweat. Until this week it was expected that the Senate would 
vote on and reject the pay raises that had been recommended last year by a 
special commission and endorsed by President Ronald Reagan. The House, though, 
would delay its vote until after Feb. 8, when the pay increases automatically 
are to take effect in the absence of vetoes by both chambers. But now, shaken 
by public opposition to the salary increases, a lot of representatives are 
having scared second thoughts. It would be too bad if those fears led to the 
loss of the pay boosts. Top federal officials deserve increases. And the 
American people deserve a Congress that will no longer have an excuse to go on 
taking payola from special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Public antipathy to the pay proposal -- 85% oppose it, according to a recent 
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll -- is understandable. The 50% salary increase 
would raise congressional pay from $89,500 to $135,000 a year. Cabinet 
secretaries, meanwhile, would go to $155,000, Supreme Court justices would be 
paid $165,000 ($175,000 for the chief justice), federal district judges would 
earn $135,000. This is handsome remuneration, no doubt about it. At $135,000, 
members of Congress would be in the top 2% or 3% of all wage earners, making 
more than four times the median family income. Americans who look just at those 
numbers aren't likely to be impressed by the argument that those who serve in 
Congress must bear unusual expenses, including keeping two homes. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, justifies the proposed pay increases? The first thing is equity; in 
the last 20 years the real buying power of top federal salaries has fallen by 
about 35%. Pay raises to levels that are more realistic and more suitable to 
the importance of the work involved are long overdue. Even more pressing in the 
case of Congress is the chance -- in fact, the imperative -- to end the scandal 
that lets senators and representatives rent themselves out to lobbying and 
other interest groups. The so-called honorariums that they collect -- worth $10 
million or more a year -- currently let House members get up to $26,000 in 
extra income, and senators $35,000. Only the most cynical or naive would 
maintain that these payments don't influence legislation and votes. 
</P>
<P>
Once the pay raise took effect, Congress, under the prod of public scrutiny, 
would be expected quickly to end this corruption by enacting a ban on outside 
income -- not just payments for speeches and appearances but professional fees 
and money from directorships as well. In short, or so reform advocates insist, 
no more payoffs, no more conflicts of interest, no more legalized corruption. 
The chance of getting a more selfless, more honest Congress doesn't come along 
every day. The pay raise would put that chance within reach.

ENDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION

<P>
Christopher's column makes a compelling case for halting further proliferation 
of nuclear weapons. Regrettably, he overlooks one obvious recommendation: Our 
government should accept Mikhail Gorbachev's standing offer to immediately end 
all further testing of nuclear warheads. In fact, we and the Soviets promised 
we'd do just that when we signed the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that we lack authority to bring about an end to nuclear 
proliferation when we continue to test these hideous weapons.

THE DRY YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they allocated full supplies of water to farm and city customers this past 
year, federal and state water managers frequently noted that California had not 
suffered three consecutive drought years in modern history, and possibly not 
since the 16th Century. The odds of a third straight drought year in 1989 were 
figured at only 1 in 10. Those calculations may fit some venerable statistical 
formula, but any lay person can see with a glance at snow and rainfall records 
that dry years come together often. Thus it would have been prudent for all of 
California to have been on a drought-emergency footing this past year. 
</P>
<P>
With the state almost certain to have a third drought year, water officials now 
must move quickly to impose realistic conservation standards. Then they should 
begin making some hard-nosed decisions about what to do in the event of a 
fourth drought year in 1990. This is what both San Francisco and Oakland water 
officials have been doing for a full year. 
</P>
<P>
Three drought years may be rare, but prolonged dry periods are not. There were 
four drought years and two below-normal years in 1929-34. Just since 1976 there 
have been four drought years and three sub-normal years. A very wet spell 
during 1982-84 allowed water managers to fill up the state's reservoirs. But 
that cushion is gone now. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to have been a wintry winter in Los Angeles. But the rains and snows 
that count are those falling in the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains, the 
major sources of the region's imported water. Both the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California 
deserve credit for implementing aggressive voluntary conservation campaigns in 
the past two years. But the key word is voluntary. There has been no sense of 
crisis in Southern California, and the campaigns have not achieved their modest 
goals of 10% savings. 
</P>
<P>
With agriculture enjoying a relative boom for the past two years, there has 
been heavy pressure on the state Water Project and the federal Central Valley 
Project to make full deliveries to irrigators. If 1989 continues dry, however, 
farm customers can expect a reduction of up to 40%. Those decisions in 
Sacramento should be made soon. Water officials are sensitive about hurting the 
farm economy, but many farmers can compensate for the cutback by pumping 
groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles needs to implement its standby ordinance for 10% water rationing 
soon and to be ready for even tougher restrictions if mountain snowpacks 
continue to dwindle. Most residents can save that much without inconvenience by 
cutting back on outdoor use, like watering lawns less frequently but more 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Both San Francisco and Oakland had 25% rationing in effect this past year 
because they lack Southern California's reservoir capacity and depend more 
directly on each year's snowmelt.In San Francisco, outdoor water use was 
reduced by 60%. The East Bay's water district had an overall saving of 26%. 
With even half that effort, Southern California should be able to get through 
another drought year without undue inconvenience. But first, officials need to 
raise the level of consciousness about the severity of the drought and tell 
area residents clearly that some sacrifices will have to be made, and soon.

ENDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Not Even One More Nuclear Nation" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 16) is a perfect title for 
Warren Christopher's timely warning about the "horrific threat" to human 
survival posed by the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries -- and 
eventually, if the trend continues, to terrorists as well. Technically 
described as horizontal proliferation (vertical proliferation meaning addition 
to existing nuclear arsenals), this creeping menace is surely one of the 
pre-eminent problems of our time. And like every serious global problem we 
face, the solution depends in large measure on cooperation between the U.S. and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, when Christopher was serving our country well in the State Department, 
I was privileged to be part of the U.S. delegation at the first United Nations 
Special Session on Disarmament. Time and again our delegates would be told by 
representatives of the 148 other nations: The U.S. and the Soviet Union insult 
our intelligence and demean our dignity by preaching nuclear abstention while 
practicing nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
The specific actions set forth by Christopher are sensible steps toward 
stopping the spread of a thermonuclear scourge. But they must be preceded by an 
all-important first step; the massive and continuous reduction of 
Soviet-American nuclear arsenals which set the right example for others.

'CHALLENGE TO PROP. 13' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "Challenge to Prop. 13," Jan. 22: 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was founded upon three basic principles. The right to speak freely, 
the right to worship as you please, and the right to own property that you 
earn. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to July 1, 1978, there was some doubt whether the ownership of property, 
especially a home, was a right or a privilege from government. Under an 
antiquated, mismanaged, and politically driven ad valorem system (of 
assessments), homes in California became prey for government confiscatory 
taxation. Annually, the boards of supervisors in most counties would raise tax 
rates in order to fund the "bloating" budgets. Then, once every two or three 
years, the assessor would raise home assessments; homeowners saw annual tax 
increases from 10% to 20% in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The tax revolt really culminated between 1974 and 1977 when homeowners in 
developing areas began to experience 50% tax increases every two years. The 
homeowners became fed up with this precarious taxing climate, and qualified 
Proposition 13 for the June, 1978, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
We are now in the second phase of that 1970s tax revolt. The homeowners, 
purchasing homes in the 1980s see government abuse in the property tax levies. 
Proposition 13 specifically states in its initial clause, Section 1a, "the 
maximum amount of ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed 1 percent." 
With the inflation in the California real estate market running at up to 8 
times the cost-price index since 1980, the Legislature and the State Board of 
Equalization have allowed this discrimination against 1980 era home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
With property tax revenues increasing annually in most California counties by 
over 10% (Los Angeles County 11% in 1988), a windfall of post-Proposition 13 
property taxes is being realized by most counties. And most of these millions 
of "new property tax" dollars are coming at the expense of recent home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is correct that there seems to be inequity in some home buyers paying 
more than their neighbors within the same areas. But, Proposition 13 was 
written to allow government flexibility during inflationary (or recessionary) 
times. There is not a word in it that takes any local power away from 
government. People can raise their own taxes at any time for any purpose, by a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
No, Proposition 13 should not be changed. The politicians and The Times need to 
realize how it can work pragmatically within all types of economic conditions. 
And, the first cure for any so-called "inequity" should be a reduction of 
post-Proposition 13 homeowner taxes, and a responsible indexing system, based 
on the national CPI that would deal with increases. 
</P>
<P>
A 25% to 40% reduction in taxes for home buyers since 1978 is in order. The 
reduction would be legal and morally correct.

'CHALLENGE TO PROP. 13' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, my family bought our house in Westwood for $5,750. By 1975 we 
were paying almost $4,000 a year in taxes. Without Prop. 13, what would we be 
paying now? 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor in her 80s sold her car, then her piano, and finally her living room 
furniture in order to remain in the home where she had lived for most of her 
life. In 1975 there were no "reverse mortgages" or arrangements for executors 
of estates to pay real estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The major beneficiaries of Prop. 13 may be businesses, but in a kinder, gentler 
nation the more important beneficiaries are the elderly, who may never have 
earned $10,000 a year in their lives but who would like to continue living in 
their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it more moral to tax paper profits on real estate than to tax paper 
profits on stocks or bonds?

RADICALS TEMPT ARGENTINA TO RELY AGAIN ON REPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL PONEMAN, Daniel Poneman is a lawyer in Washington and the author of 
Argentina: Democracy on Trial (Paragon House, 1987). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week Argentines witnessed a strange reprise of the guerrilla violence that 
plunged their nation into chaos in the 1970s. The smoke has cleared from the 
burning barracks at La Tablada, revealing charred bodies but few answers. Is a 
new cycle of violence at hand? 
</P>
<P>
The physical evidence of the Jan. 23-24 assault on the 3rd Infantry Regiment -- 
Chinese and Soviet arms, the revolutionary screed left behind, the inclusion of 
women in their ranks -- indicated that the attackers were left-wing radicals. 
Later they were identified as members of the Movement of All for the Fatherland 
-- a group that had been unheard of until early last month, when it accused 
Peronist presidential candidate Carlos Menem of ties with right-wing, 
coup-mongering Army officers. Some of the dead assailants also were linked to 
the Revolutionary Army of the People -- a Trotskyite group that was largely 
wiped out in the 1970s by security forces after it tried to take over Tucuman 
province in northwest Argentina. Yet the political parties most closely linked 
to the 1970s terrorists have denied any link to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The most important questions remain unanswered: Do other cadres lie in wait? 
Who are they? What do they want? What will they do to get it? Will more attacks 
follow? When? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the answers turn out to be, a few clear winners emerged from the 
bloody events that took 38 lives at La Tablada. The army showed that it could 
overwhelm an insurgent force (admittedly some hours after the insurgents 
overwhelmed a regiment). Cassandras of the right were vindicated for their 
ceaseless warnings in recent years of a "subversive resurgence." And urban 
guerrillas put themselves back onto the political map. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest victor was extremism itself. The political views of the attackers 
matter less than their decision to press those views through violence. Violence 
knows no creed, and its use on one side encourages it on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Like a trauma victim after years of recovery, Argentina has had a flashback to 
the confusion and out-of-the-blue bloodletting that brought the country to its 
knees not so long ago. The greatest danger is that the country will return 
reflexively to the same response: lawless repression under the watchless eyes 
of a frightened public. 
</P>
<P>
Memories are too fresh and democratic sentiment too strong to permit one 
isolated incident, however grave, to drive Argentina back to the policies that 
characterized its last struggle against subversion -- torture, murder, 
"disappearance," suspension of civil rights. But terrorism is a powerful 
solvent of constitutional scruples. If more deadly attacks follow, the pressure 
for vigilante responses will grow. 
</P>
<P>
President Raul Alfonsin has attempted to head off these dangers by responding 
forcefully to the crisis at hand, but insisting that the response be carried 
out within the rule of law. He submitted the 14 surrendering attackers to 
civilian justice while establishing a national security council to develop 
policies and coordinate actions against subversive activities. "Make no 
mistake," he told the nation, "our constant testament for the rights of man 
does not constitute weakness in the face of armed subversion." 
</P>
<P>
Brave words aside, the incident remains profoundly troubling. It raises the 
ghosts of a decade that still wounds the national soul, a decade in which 
Argentina gave the word desaparecido (disappeared one) to the world and brought 
itself great international shame. Although the subversive movement in Argentina 
was annihilated more than 10 years ago, no one can deny that the depressed 
socioeconomic conditions in Latin America today could support a terrorist 
resurgence. Peru and Colombia have been in the grips of terrorism for a decade, 
with no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latin governments have been struggling to make democracy work -- restoring 
political and civil rights, reopening courts and legislatures, peacefully 
handing over power to political opponents. Wracked by debt and recession, 
though, democratic governments have been unable to show their people a better 
life. A return to political violence would only worsen the region's economic 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new breeze blowing in Latin America, a chill wind of despair -- of 
stagnant economies, inept politicians and recurrent violence. It is a breeze 
that, if it continues to blow, may snuff out Latin American hopes for a better 
tomorrow.

COACHES TO SELECT POSTSEASON ALL-STAR TEAMS BASED ON LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Section, moving to fine-tune a sweeping releaguing plan that took 
effect last fall, will direct coaches to select postseason all-star teams based 
on leagues rather than conferences, City Commissioner Hal Harkness said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted by Taft football Coach Tom Stevenson, will go into 
effect before postseason basketball teams are selected. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that he will issue the directive to avoid a repeat of the 
postseason selection process in football in which coaches picked all-star teams 
for the first time since the City realigned its membership into 6 conferences 
of 2 leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In that instance, coaches in the Valley Pac-8 Conference, which includes the 
Mid-Valley and East Valley leagues, selected an all-conference team. However, 
their colleagues in the Northwest Valley Conference picked all-league teams 
from the West Valley and North Valley leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness considers the selection process important because of the impact it has 
on All-City teams, which are chosen by the Amateur Athletic Foundation. Players 
excluded from all-league teams are ineligible for All-City consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly acute in so-called split conferences: those in 
which one league plays at the 4-A Division level and the other at the 3-A. The 
Northwest Valley Conference in basketball comprises the 4-A North Valley League 
and the 3-A West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the All-City teams we can't pick all-conference teams," Harkness 
said. "Frankly, we never addressed this before. It's just something that came 
up. We need direction and I'm going to voice my opinion as how we should 
operate." 
</P>
<P>
That comes as good news to Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, an all-conference team is an invalid concept when you have mixed 
leagues, but if the City said 'pick an all-conference team,' then we would have 
done it," he said. "But nobody said anything. There was no direction and we 
need direction on this." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson and his fellow conference coaches received media criticism for 
selecting all-league teams from leagues comprising only 4 teams. Nevertheless, 
Stevenson said that he favors the all-league concept. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be represented by our league because the City chooses playoff teams 
by league and everything is geared toward league, so an all-league team is the 
logical step," he said. "Besides, it helps build a positive attitude toward our 
program. If you get eight to 10 kids on all-league, they like the recognition."

<P>
The L.A. City Section athletic office came under fire from several South Bay 
basketball coaches for its recent decision to allow all 16 4-A Division teams 
to participate in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick made only 13 of 46 field goals and committed 14 turnovers in dropping 
a 34-28 Prep League basketball game to Pasadena Poly, the top-ranked team in 
the CIF 1-A Division.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: FAMILY INFLUENCE WINS PILOTS' WHITFIELD FOR STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Whitfield, whose balance of athletic ability and good grades made him the 
most sought-after football prospect in the South Bay, ended the suspense 
Tuesday by verbally committing to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-7, 275-pound offensive tackle from Banning High said a coaching change 
and the influence of his family persuaded him to choose the Cardinal over 
Michigan and Notre Dame. He also visited UCLA and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"(Stanford Coach) Dennis Green had a major influence on me," Whitfield said. "I 
liked him the first time we met and I know he's a good coach. He's putting in a 
pro-style offense, similar to that of the 49ers, which I liked. If I want to 
pursue a career in the pros after college, this will help me." 
</P>
<P>
Green, an assistant coach with the 49ers, replaced Jack Elway as Stanford coach 
after the season, becoming the first black head football coach in the Pac-10 
Conference. Almost immediately, Green began pursuing Whitfield, rated the No. 1 
prospect in the Far West by Super Prep magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Whitfield had narrowed his choices to Michigan and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"(Green) called me and set up a home visit," he said. "I talked to him for 
about two hours and decided to visit Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
The two-time All-L.A. City lineman took his final recruiting trip to Palo Alto 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford was also the first choice of Whitfield's mother and sister, who 
attends Cal State Hayward in the Bay area. Whitfield said being close to his 
sister weighed heavily in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes kids get it in their heads that they want to go back east to 
school," said John Becker, Banning recruiting coordinator. "Then they find out 
how far it is and how long it takes to fly there. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is perfect for Bob. You cannot knock the facilities or the logistics. 
It's close enough to come home. The key thing was that the mother wanted him to 
go there since he was in the 10th grade." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield was one of three Banning players to give verbal commitments this 
week. Defensive back Paul Montgomery committed to Oregon State and linebacker 
Randy Woolridge picked Northern Arizona, giving the Pilots at least nine 
players who are expected to sign with four-year colleges when the 
letter-of-intent period starts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gardena basketball Coach Bill Hughes before the season: "If spring and 
summer league was any indication, we'll be one of the better teams in the 
City." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has a different opinion now, his team languishing in last place in the 
Southern League with a 2-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Although Gardena played well during the off-season, winning 30 of 35 games in 
the summer, Hughes said he underestimated the competition in the L.A. City 4-A 
Division and the disparity among teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more realistic now to what's going on in the City, how powerful the teams 
are," he said. "I've had coaches tell me (that) if I want to win at Gardena 
I'll have to recruit, and I'm not willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm a good coach, and I can't win. I enjoy coaching when things are 
equal. It makes it frustrating because things are not equal." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' frustration reached the boiling point Jan. 13 when he was involved in 
an argument with an official after Gardena's 75-74 overtime loss to Banning. He 
was suspended by the school for one game. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who coached Reseda to L.A. City 3-A titles in 1983 and '84, says 
Gardena does not belong in 4-A. The Mohicans were 6-17 overall and 1-9 in the 
Marine League last season when they were one of three 4-A teams that missed the 
playoffs. Despite the finish, they were kept in 4-A when leagues were realigned 
for this season. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Fremont, a 4-A semifinalist last season, was moved down to 
the 3-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like (L.A. City) is punishing us," Hughes said. "The kids worked 
very hard in the off-season. But if we lose our last three games, it means we 
worked all those hours and months to win one more league game than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't justify that when I look at my kids and my family. I took all that 
time away from them, and for what?" 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carroll, Bishop Montgomery's new football coach, hopes to succeed where 
others have failed by turning the Knights into a winner in the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the toughest league in the state," he said. "I have one main goal, 
and that is to reach the top of the league. It's going to take a lot of hard 
work and patience, but we should be able to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who will remain athletic director, has a history of winning. Before 
coming to Bishop Montgomery last year, he was an assistant coach for two 
seasons at the University of Nevada-Reno and helped the Wolfpack to 11-1 and 
13-1 records. Before that, he was defensive coordinator for two years at Rice 
High School in Altair, Tex., which won back-to-back district titles. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bishop Montgomery has never qualified for the Southern Section 
playoffs from the Angelus League -- posting a 6-18 record over the last five 
years -- Carroll believes it's only a matter of time before the Knights join 
the upper echelon of Servite, Mater Dei, Bishop Amat and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great possibility within the next few years that we will become 
very competitive in the Angelus League," he said. "I would not have taken the 
job if I did not think the program had a chance at some point to be competitive 
and win the Angelus League title." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was encouraged by the strength of Bishop Montgomery's underclass teams 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 29, takes over for Andy Szabatura, who resigned last week after 
coaching the Knights to a 21-29 record in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard forward Juno Armstrong, sidelined for more than a month because of 
a viral infection that settled in his right leg, made his first start since 
Dec. 17 in the Vikings' 103-101 non-league basketball loss Monday night to St. 
Paul at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year varsity starter and the team captain, Armstrong scored five points 
in his first stint of extended playing time since the Beverly Hills Tournament 
in the second week of the season. When he went out of the lineup, the 6-4 
senior was averaging 16 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said Armstrong's condition has gradually 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
"The leg was at its worst about two weeks ago," McClune said. "It had 
atrophied. I'd say it was about 70% of its regular size. It looked as if he had 
been in a cast for several months." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's improvement gives the Vikings hope that he can contribute in the 
Southern Section 5-AA playoffs, but McClune remains cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Trouble is," he said, "he's lost a lot of quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance guard Rick Robison, leading scorer in the South Bay with a 28.1 
average, had 20 points Tuesday night to lead the Tartars to a 74-60 Bay League 
win over Palos Verdes, four days after suffering minor injuries in a car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Carl Strong said Robison was riding with friends in the camper of a 
pickup truck Friday night when the vehicle hit a curb and flipped. The 6-foot 
junior suffered "bumps and bruises," Strong said, but was able to play and help 
Torrance remain in a tie for second place in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle none were killed," Strong said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars and Inglewood, both 7-3 in the Bay standings, meet at 7:30 tonight 
at Torrance to decide sole possession of second place. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's star player is also hurting. Forward Harold Miner suffered a 
sprained ankle in the Sentinels' 76-72 win over league leader Rolling Hills on 
Tuesday night and is questionable tonight. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Marc Gerhardt, the new baseball coach at South Torrance High, is 
looking for a coach for the Spartans' junior varsity team. Anyone interested 
can call Gerhardt at 419-2565 (days) or at 540-9773 (nights and weekends). 
Gerhardt formerly was head baseball coach at Inglewood and Lennox and was an 
assistant for four years at South . . . The El Segundo soccer team leads the 
Camino Real League with an 8-1-1 record following 2-0 wins over former 
co-leader Bosco Tech on Saturday and Verbum Dei on Tuesday. Sweeper Greg Brooks 
and goaltender Rolic Rougsegger are the leaders of the Eagles' defense, which 
has recorded four straight shutouts . . . Jennifer Stone added to her 
team-leading goal total with one score and goaltender Darla Cuiper recorded her 
13th shutout Tuesday as the Hawthorne girls soccer team remained in first place 
in the Bay League with a 2-0 win over Santa Monica. The Cougars (17-1-3 overall 
and 8-1 in the league) are ranked seventh in the Southern Section 4-A Division.

TORO CAGERS HIT THE ROAD;

<P>
DOMINGUEZ HILLS TO FACE SLUMPING BAKERSFIELD IN FIRST OF FOUR GAMES

BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four consecutive road games begin here tonight for the Cal State Dominguez 
Hills men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
A packed house is expected at Civic Auditorium for the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. contest between the Toros (12-6 overall, 4-1 in the CCAA) and 
slumping Cal State Bakersfield (14-4, 3-2). Game time is 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
How Dominguez Hills fares tonight may depend on how it handles the distractions 
that CCAA teams face in Civic. The antiquated facility, where the lights hang 
low, is a tough place to play. The home crowd loves to get into the game, and 
it is the only facility in the CCAA that allows the sale of beer and wine. 
Spectators sit so close to the floor that they have been known to refer to Toro 
Coach Dave Yanai by his first name. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Roadrunners have given up on this facility. A new on-campus gymnasium, 
about seven miles south of the Civic's downtown location, is expected to be 
open in time for the CCAA post-season tournament, should Bakersfield win the 
regular season title and earn the right to play host to it. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which entertains Dominguez Hills on Saturday night, 
plays in a campus gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai calls this trip one of the great adventures each year. But the bottom 
line, he will remind you, is that it will take total concentration to sweep 
this weekend's slate. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's contest will be the first of four games in eight days for the two 
teams, a stretch that many believe will play a major role in the outcome of the 
conference race. Bakersfield, the defending co-champion and a preseason CCAA 
favorite along with UC Riverside, slipped coming out of the gate. The 
Roadrunners, ranked 13th nationally in Division II, were upset by San Luis 
Obispo in their home opener two weeks ago, then fell to host Riverside Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Second-place Dominguez Hills, on the other hand, came within a point of owning 
the top spot. The Toros' only loss is to Riverside, 59-58. Dominguez Hills has 
won seven of its last eight games and has not allowed a conference opponent 60 
points. The Toros rank fourth in the nation in defense. 
</P>
<P>
But the team has been shooting poorly. In its last two games Dominguez Hills 
shot 36% from the field and 22.6% from 3-point territory. The result has been 
an average 15 points per game under its 70.3% average. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably from 3-point range, Dominguez Hills has missed accuracy from 
sophomore guard Robert Barksdale, who has been slowed by the flu. Barksdale, 
whom many expect to be the league's premier all-around player by the time he is 
a senior, made just one of six 3-point tries last week. In his past two games 
the Hawthorne High graduate connected on only seven of 20 field goals. By 
contrast, the streaky shooter set a school record in a preseason game at Azusa 
Pacific University by going 10 for 10 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Anthony Blackmon has also struggled from the field. A contender 
for most valuable player in the conference, Blackmon made just 11 of 32 field 
goal tries last week. His shooting attempts have been flat, the possible result 
of being tired from all the playing time he has received this season (he's 
averaging 36.5 minutes a game) or a bruised knee suffered in the opening 
minutes of a win at Cal Poly Pomona a week and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon, however, denied last week that the knee was affecting him, and that 
was evident by his rebounding totals of 16 in a 55-52 double overtime victory 
at Cal State Los Angeles and 12 in Saturday's 56-51 win over visiting Cal State 
Northridge. Even with his shooting problems, Blackmon has averaged 19 points, 
10 1/2 rebounds, three assists, three steals and about two blocked shots over 
the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough kid. . . . I have confidence in him," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills probably will attempt to take the ball inside the key more 
offensively in the next two games. Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo primarily 
use man-to-man defenses, and Bakersfield is expected to start a three-guard 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, Dominguez Hills can afford to split the two games and still have 
a good shot at making the CCAA postseason tournament. Bakersfield needs a win 
to keep San Luis Obispo and surprising Chapman College off its back. Both are 
also 3-2.

PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
3-POINTER CLINCHES HARBOR WIN OVER BARSTOW, 74-70 
</P>

<P>
It took a three-point basket by Keith Billingslea with 27 seconds remaining to 
clinch a Los Angeles Harbor 74-70 basketball victory over pesky Barstow 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor improved its Southern California Athletic Conference record to 6-3 and 
13-10 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Barstow took a 43-35 halftime lead behind DeChaunce Veasley's 15 points. He 
finished with 25. 
</P>
<P>
"(Barstow) really played well in the first half," Harbor Coach Ken Curry said. 
"I told our kids at halftime to just go out and play. We just didn't execute 
well offensively in the first half. Over the last three games, we really 
haven't played very well on the offensive end of the floor. The good thing 
about tonight's game is that we won. I guess a win is a win, and I will take it 
any way we can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Hendrix turned in a strong performance for the Seahawks. He scored a 
game-high 27 points, including 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't get into who is scoring a lot of points for us during the 
game," Curry said. "It was a surprise to me that Jerome scored that many 
points. The way we played, we needed every one of them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Barstow (5-18, 3-6) took control of the game early. The Vikings went on a 10-0 
run midway through the first half to open a 13-point bulge, 26-13. Hendrix 
scored a three-point basket in the closing seconds of the half to move the 
Seahawks to within eight. 
</P>
<P>
After four lead changes during the second half, the Vikings moved ahead, 68-63, 
on a Veasley jumper with 3:31 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea hit a three-pointer from the baseline and Hendrix scored a lay-in 
off a steal by Charles Perry to knot the game at 70 with 1:18 to play. 
Billingslea finished with 15 points. Perry scored 11 and Ronald Lewis had 10 
for Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 98, Mt. San Antonio 73 -- El Camino College applied the defense in 
the second half to pull away from a slender 40-39 halftime lead and remain in 
first place in the South Coast Conference with two games left. The Warriors 
improved to 20-6 overall and 5-1 in the SCC. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Sac kept the game close with three-point shooting before El Camino's 
second-half defense forced the pace in the Warriors' favor. Forward David 
Keeter led the winners with 23 points and added seven assists and three blocked 
shots. Forward Zlatko Josic had 17 points and eight rebounds.

ANKLE INJURY TO SIDELINE CASSIDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Cassidy, a senior starting guard for St. Genevieve High, said that he will 
miss Friday's San Fernando Valley League game against Notre Dame because of a 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, who leads Valley-area players in assists with an 11.4 average, was 
injured Tuesday during the Valiants' 71-47 loss to Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not broken and I don't think I tore anything," Cassidy said. "It's just 
sprained pretty good. I'm on crutches." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, who averages a team-high 15.6 points a game, said that he will attempt 
to return for Tuesday's game against Harvard.

CANYON'S MCCUNE REJECTS OFFER, RULES OUT FOOTBALL AS FRESHMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sean McCune, a Times All-Valley linebacker from Canyon High, became the second 
Cowboy in 2 days to say he does not intend to play college football next fall. 
</P>
<P>
McCune said Wednesday that Colorado State recruiter Skip Holtz, son of Notre 
Dame Coach Lou Holtz, offered him a scholarship after a recruiting trip 2 weeks 
ago. But McCune rejected the offer, canceled recruiting trips to San Diego 
State and Washington State and said that he does not want to play football. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Fix, McCune's teammate on the Canyon defense, said Tuesday that he does 
not plan to play football or attend college next fall, citing academic problems 
and his own mixed feelings about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
McCune, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior, carries a 3.4 grade-point average and 
plans to attend school. He said that he has applied at Arizona and Arizona 
State and might play later in his college career. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best thing for me right now is to not play football," he said. "I 
just don't want to play anymore. I just want to go to school and worry about 
college." 
</P>
<P>
McCune insisted that the decision is his own and should not reflect on Coach 
Harry Welch's program at Canyon. McCune transferred from Agoura to play his 
senior season at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an excellent program at Canyon and I really improved as a player," 
he said. "It's not that Cowboy football turned me off. If anything, that's what 
turned me on to football." JOHN LYNCH

CSUN WOMEN SEEK TO END DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have done their best to ignore the facts. 
</P>
<P>
They have prepared for tonight's California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's 
basketball game the same way they always do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're treating it just like any other game," Cal State Northridge Coach Leslie 
Milke said. 
</P>
<P>
So is there reason not to believe her? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors' opponent tonight is not just any CCAA team. It is Cal Poly 
Pomona (15-4, 4-0 in conference play), ranked No. 2 in Division II and a team 
that has won or shared the conference championship each of the past 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, Pomona is 29-1 against Northridge, its only loss on Jan. 20, 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Lady Broncos have trampled the Lady Matadors 28 times. Yes, 
trampled. Of Pomona's 29 wins, 25 have been by 10 or more points -- including 
18 by 20 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is a little different," Milke said. "We have a lot of new kids. I 
don't think the mystique has been ingrained in them yet." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge came close to ending its losing streak against Pomona 2 seasons ago. 
The Lady Matadors led by 7 points and had the ball with 32 seconds left. The 
final: Pomona, 88-78. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona forced 4 turnovers in the last half-minute to tie the score after 
regulation, then outscored CSUN 14-4 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Milke is quick to point out, only one player from this season's 
team -- guard Vicki Mallett -- was around to see that one. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors (15-4, 3-1) will be playing without center Chris Cavalin. 
</P>
<P>
Cavalin, the team's leading scorer (16.6) and rebounder (10.1), is still 
bothered by a pulled groin muscle she suffered in practice last Friday. "It's 
still bad," Milke said, "and if we play her now we might lose her for the rest 
of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona center Niki Bracken leads the conference with an 18.4 scoring average 
and is fourth in rebounding with an 8.6 average. Guard Cathy Gooden is 
averaging 14.9 points and 5.6 assists.

TROUBLED KAYPRO LAYS OFF MORE WORKERS

Kaypro Corp., the financially distressed personal computer manufacturer, said 
Wednesday that it laid off 40 workers at its Solana Beach manufacturing and 
office facility last Friday, a 17% reduction in its work force. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro spokesman Joseph Marcello also said Wednesday that Kaypro's cash flow is 
now insufficient to finance the company's operations and that payment of some 
suppliers has been delayed. As a result, some of those suppliers have refused 
to ship Kaypro necessary components to make some of its computer products. 
</P>
<P>
Marcello said he could not say how the company was getting cash to fund 
operations. In the past, Kaypro Chairman Andrew Kay has personally loaned 
Kaypro more than $2.8 million to pay its bills, but Marcello said he could not 
say whether Kay has made more loans recently. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro's 12-acre manufacturing plant in Solana Beach is scheduled to be sold 
Feb. 27, Marcello said. Gains from the sale are ticketed to provide the company 
with cash as well as pay off a $7-million loan from Commonwealth Financial. 
</P>
<P>
Marcello said Kaypro booked $145,000 in orders for its computers Jan. 31, the 
highest daily total in three months. He held out the possibility that, if the 
order rate is maintained, Kaypro might hire back some of the workers laid off 
last week. The layoffs reduced Kaypro's payroll to 198 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been cutting jobs steadily over the last 18 months. Last 
Thursday, the day before the latest round of layoffs, Kaypro said in a press 
release that it had reduced its payroll to 238 workers, from the 577 as of 
October 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 workers let go last week, 20 were manufacturing employees and the 
rest were spread among technological support and engineering staff, Marcello 
said.

COMMODITY TRADING REFORMS DISCUSSED

<TEXT>
<P>
A special panel of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange convened for the first time 
Wednesday to discuss possible reforms of trading practices that are the focus 
of a sweeping federal fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Any proposed changes could take months to draft and then would have to be 
submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that 
regulates the industry, Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma said following the closed 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the House Agriculture Committee designated Rep. Glenn English 
(D-Okla.) to direct a congressional investigation into trading practices in the 
futures and options markets. 
</P>
<P>
English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural 
development, said the probe would focus on the CFTC's regulation of the markets 
and on the self-regulating ability of the markets themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Yemma described the meeting of the Merc's special committee as the first in a 
series planned for the nine-member committee in Chicago and New York to discuss 
trading rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invites Abuse 
</P>
<P>
The Merc established the panel following disclosure of a two-year undercover 
federal probe of alleged widespread fraud in the Chicago futures markets, in 
which investors may have been cheated out of millions of dollars by illegal 
trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
One practice under increasing scrutiny has been dual trading, in which traders 
can buy and sell for themselves and their customers simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime practice is legal but critics say it invites abuse of the 
traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading.

BABY'S BOTTLE WILL TELL YOU IF IT'S TOO HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The latest in infant products is a bottle that tells when the milk or formula 
it holds is too hot for baby. The bottle doesn't talk -- it changes color. 
</P>
<P>
Just released by ansa Bottle Company Inc. of Muskogee, Okla., the Easy-to-Know 
bottle is made of a heat-sensitive plastic that turns from various pastel 
shades at room temperature to white when its contents are too hot. 
</P>
<P>
The hotter the liquid, the greater the color change of the bottle, which also 
features ansa's distinctive design -- it has an elongated hole in its middle, 
making it easier for infants and parents to hold. 
</P>
<P>
The company pioneered the design with its 1984 Easy-to-Hold bottle, an original 
of which is exhibited in New York's Museum of Modern Art as "an example of good 
design and intelligent use of plastic." 
</P>
<P>
The new 9-ounce bottle comes in rose, mint, peach and lavender. It can be 
heated in a microwave or sterilizer and is dishwasher safe. Suggested retail 
for Easy-To-Know is $3 to $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
It will be available nationwide in March at drug, grocery and discount outlets 
including K mart, Target, Walgreen Drug Stores, Thrifty Drug Stores, Osco Drug, 
Toys-R-Us, Kids-R-Us and Lucky supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A Talkative Watch 
</P>
<P>
A new alarm watch from Japan, now being introduced in the U.S., lets its owner 
know what's on its mind. 
</P>
<P>
Marketed by Mind Dimensions Ltd. of Thousand Oaks, the Satoki Talking Space 
Watch at the press of a button vocalizes the time, besides providing a digital 
readout of hours, minutes and seconds. It can be programmed as a stop watch and 
lap time counter. The wristwatch has a day-, month- and date calendar function 
and an alarm with a snooze setting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful aid for blind people or people who work in dark places," 
Dorothy Gaine, Mind Dimensions director of overseas marketing, said of the 
watch, which comes in black, beige or khaki and runs on two silver-oxide cells 
that should last about 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $59.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling. It can be ordered by check 
or money order from Mind Dimensions Ltd., 1790 La Granada Drive, Thousand Oaks, 
Calif. 91362 or call (805) 379-0072. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh-Frozen Juice 
</P>
<P>
The newest entry in a burgeoning market is a premium frozen orange juice, 
which, unlike others, is not concentrated or pasteurized. Just Pik't juice -- 
orange or grapefruit -- is frozen in its natural state right after it has been 
squeezed. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith of the Fresh Juice Co. of Great Neck, N.Y., who spent three years 
developing and testing the product, said his juice is "simply fresh-squeezed 
and then fresh-frozen. Other than that, it is not tampered with in any way, so 
it keeps its true taste and total nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
Selling for $1.99, the juice comes in one-liter plastic containers that 
consumers can defrost at home. Once Just Pik't is defrosted, it lasts only 
about a week in the refrigerator before it loses its fresh taste. It is 
available in the frozen food sections at Alpha Beta, Certified Grocers, 
Gelsons, Hughes, Ralphs and Von's markets. LYNN SIMROSS

YOUR WHEELS: AGENCY MAY OFFER HELP IN THE CLUTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am having a big dispute with a service garage over a new clutch 
that they installed in my Ford Mustang. They claim that they can't guarantee a 
clutch because it could be ruined by the way I drive. But it failed after only 
one day, and I think they just botched the job. I am out $375. Is there 
anything I can do? -- B.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is true that a motorist can so badly mistreat a clutch that it will 
quickly fail, but a brand-new clutch almost never fails in a single day. 
Moreover, unless the clutch lining was worn out, you have a very strong case to 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every state, including California, has a government agency set up to 
help motorists with repair disputes. With all the problems motorists are having 
getting today's complicated cars fixed, you can imagine that these government 
offices are swamped. Still, they are often able to help. 
</P>
<P>
In California, you need to contact the Bureau of Automotive Repair, which 
licenses and regulates automobile repair facilities. Their areas of 
jurisdiction include whether repairs were properly made and whether they were 
properly priced. Their toll-free telephone number is (800) 952-5210. The agency 
has 10 operators on duty, in addition to 21 offices around the state where a 
motorist can walk in and file a complaint. They typically handle more than 100 
complaints a day. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a complaint, the agency contacts the motorist to get his side 
of the story and then contacts the repair garage. Because it is in charge of 
regulating and licensing the garages, the agency has some clout in getting the 
garages to agree to reasonable settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau does not get involved in new-car warranty disputes; those are 
handled by a different state agency. And problems in registration disputes are 
handled by yet another agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't resolve your dispute through the Bureau of Automotive Repair, you 
can always sue in small claims court. It's a lot easier than you think. Under 
state law, the garage is not allowed to hire an attorney and neither are you, 
so it is a fair contest of your allegations against the garage's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 1982 Toyota Corolla fails to restart after it is warmed up. The dealer 
has checked the battery, changed the cable from the battery to the starter and 
changed the starter. It seems worse in hot weather. Do you have any ideas? -- 
E.V. 
</P>
<P>
A: Hot restart problems in which the engine does not turn over are generally 
traceable to a poor electrical connection in the high-amperage cables that 
carry current from the battery to the starter. You say that the lead from the 
battery to the starter was replaced, but you should also change the ground 
cable from the battery to the body. It is also possible that the electrical 
charging system was checked out but that the battery is not capable of putting 
out adequate current. Hot weather imposes a big load on the battery because 
resistance in the cable and electrical connections rise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Update 
</P>
<P>
A motorist recently wrote that his Audi, equipped with a fuel-injection system, 
had been running poorly and that a mechanic said his combustion chambers needed 
to have the carbon cleaned out. Audi has strongly recommended that its owners 
use gasoline that contains detergents, which help keep fuel-injection systems 
and combustion chambers clean. In addition, Audi dealers will clean engine and 
fuel-injection system carbon deposits one time at no charge. Some Audi owners 
have received notices in the mail. If you have any problems getting this 
service, you should contact Audi's factory representatives.

YOUR COINS: HISTORY ON THE PHILIPPINE PISO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: A few years ago I acquired a Marcos-Reagan 1982 Philippines 25 piso 
coin. What is its present value? -- H.W.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Most countries issue commemoratives of one sort or another. Ancient 
Greek and Roman rulers started the practice. It was good for the ego and has 
had a lasting imprint on history. The Philippines have followed suit with coins 
honoring Gen. Douglas MacArthur, various papal visits and deposed President 
Ferdinand Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Marcos and former President Ronald Reagan adorn the same coin 
should prove interesting to collectors. As you probably know, the United States 
does not honor living Presidents on coinage. Only a few of our Presidents are 
memorialized on coins and bills. Politics is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
However, medals honoring all our Presidents are available. A complete set in 
bronze (Option No. 154) is $54. Contact the United States Mint, Customer 
Affairs Staff, 10001 Aerospace Drive, Lantham, Md. 20706; telephone (301) 
436-7400. 
</P>
<P>
Your Philippine coin with Marcos and Reagan on the obverse, catalogues for $45. 
Realistically, expect $10 to $20 from a dealer.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: BEER NOT NECESSARILY A LIQUID ASSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is there a premium on beer cans that still contain the original brew? 
I have an extensive collection and I'd like to show it. If I empty the cans, is 
there a way to do it without damaging the can or marring the exhibit? -- C.T. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Collectors say it actually doesn't make a great deal of difference 
whether the can has the original stuff in it. But if you do decide to empty the 
can, there is a way not to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Don't open the collectible beer can from the top, as you would to drink the 
contents. Use a church key to make the opening on the bottom instead, so that 
the holes can't be seen when your collection is displayed. Otherwise, say 
collectors, your collection won't attract much attention, and its value will 
take a nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
Most collectors, incidentally, do empty the cans, if for no other purpose than 
that they are obviously lighter to lug around. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, cans that are rusted or dented shouldn't be shown unless they are 
extremely rare, for the same reason -- your display will look more like a 
garbage dump than an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't to say a garbage dump isn't a source of collectible cans if you can 
stand the smell. There are plenty of stories about collectors finding rare beer 
cans with minor dents in such unlikely places, rather than at more conventional 
flea markets or swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike with some other collectibles, it's not taboo to touch up a rare beer can 
if you can match it to the original colors and design. To do this properly, 
however, you have to know how to work with enamel and metallic paint. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Here is a difficult one. We have a fully functional radio from a B-17 World 
War II bomber. Is there a market for such an item? -- S.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: It's difficult to answer your question without a close inspection of the 
radio. Floyd A. Paul of the Southern California Antique Radio Society says your 
best bet is to bring it to one of the society's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The society has more than 600 members, so your chances of getting some 
information about the B-17 radio's collectible value should be good.

Our recent piece on cigarette cards included the mention of the London 
Cigarette Card Co. Ltd., the oldest (founded in 1927) and probably the largest 
supplier of such cards. 
</P>
<P>
The company's director, F. C. Doggett, wrote us to say his firm has an 
inventory of more than 300 million cards from about 13,000 series produced 
worldwide over a period of more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Doggett writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Two of Britain's largest tobacco companies still issue cards with their 
cigars, but most collectors over here prefer the pre-World War II series, 
especially those featuring film stars, sportsmen, trains, military uniforms, 
etc., many of which are still readily available in mint condition at about $10 
to $20 for a complete set. 
</P>
<P>
"It is these that are also most popular with the American collectors, who 
account for almost one-fifth of our turnover." 
</P>
<P>
Doggett's firm has published a new three-volume, illustrated catalogue for 
1989, covering 11,500 series. It's priced at $34, including postage. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's address: London Cigarette Card Co. Ltd., Sutton Road, Somerton, 
Somerset, England TA11 6QP. 
</P>
<P>
Another resource for cigarette card collectors also surfaced. Delores Haddon, 
who, along with three other individuals, owns a shop called Atterdag Classics 
in Solvang, Calif., says: "We have sold (cigarette cards) for at least two 
years." Write to 444 Atterdag Road, No. 6, Solvang, Calif. 93463. Telephone 
(805) 688-9449.

Robert Harth, general manager of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., has 
accepted an appointment as president and chief executive officer of the Aspen 
Music Festival and School in Colorado, effective Oct. 1. He will replace 
longtime Aspen chief Gordon Hardy, who will retire from his post after 28 
years. Harth formerly spent 12 summers working at Aspen (1963-74). He then 
worked in various capacities at the Ravinia Festival in Chicago before joining 
the L.A. Philharmonic in 1979. Harth will remain at his Philharmonic posts -- 
he runs the Hollywood Bowl operation during the summer -- through September.

A tape of an interview convicted murderer Ted Bundy had with Christian 
anti-pornography crusader Dr. James Dobson shortly before his execution last 
week will be offered to the public in exchange for a donation of under $30. On 
the 29-minute videotaped, Bundy blames pornography for helping to turn him into 
a serial killer. An executive with Dobson's Focus on the Family organization 
said the videotape would be put "in the hands of people with anti-pornography 
groups . . . (to( meet whatever demand is there." Internal Revenue Service 
regulations prevent direct sale of the videotape by the ministry. ALEENE

STAGE WATCH : MEDNICK TAKES HELM OF ROVING FESTIVAL; WILL CEASE-AND-DESIST 
ORDERS CEASE?

It's back to the future for the Padua Hills Playwrights Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Padua Hills founder Murray Mednick has resumed command of the festival, one of 
the Southland's principal playwright development outposts, following 16 months 
in which Roxanne Rogers was the artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
And the festival has again joined the ranks of the homeless, in what has become 
virtually an annual predicament since the festival left its original Padua 
Hills venue in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's festival was held at the Pacific Design Center. "It was very 
noisy," Rogers said. "It limited what we could do. We had to push so much for 
volume, we almost had to use mikes." 
</P>
<P>
Three sites, including two schools, are being considered for next summer's 
festival. "We want to go where we have housing as well as space," Mednick said. 
"It's important for (festival participants) to stay together." He expects an 
agreement on a new home to be reached within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers resigned because "several board members wanted to expand (the number of 
public performances)," she said. "My feeling was that we don't have the 
experience as producers or the financial resources to do that, and that the 
strength of Padua Hills is in the workshops and teaching." She also felt that 
running Padua Hills next year would be "a double-time job" -- a commitment she 
wasn't prepared to make. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that Rogers likes the festival just as it is. She believes 
Padua Hills "isn't screening its plays well enough. Our standard writers could 
just submit anything and we'd do it. I think they should bring a question 
instead of just a play. They should say 'This is what I want to explore' 
instead of 'I've written 28 plays, and here's one more.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mednick agreed that the playwrights should think of themes, and he said that he 
may establish a theme for each year's festival and ask the playwrights to 
address it in their writing. However, he rejected the suggestion of more 
rigorous play screening; he doesn't even read the plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We invite people, not plays," he said. "It's optional whether people even do a 
play." Rogers expressed hope that new voices could be heard at Padua Hills, but 
Mednick cautioned that "Padua is more like a school than like a showcase -- and 
you don't just turn over the faculty every year." 
</P>
<P>
Mednick left the job in 1987 "because I was burned out," he said. Last summer, 
he was on tour in Yugoslavia and didn't even attend the festival. "I'm still 
not interested in the administrative side of it," he said, "but I am interested 
in the exchange of ideas. I want Padua to survive. I'm not taking it over 
permanently -- just during this period of reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the festival's first off-season production, John O'Keefe's one-man 
"Shimmer," will open Feb. 16 and run through March 12 at the New Playwrights 
Foundation Theatre, 6111 W. Olympic Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
CEASE-FIRE: In the four months since Actors' Equity put its 99-Seat Theater 
Plan into effect, a number of Equity members (Equity won't reveal how many) 
received cease-and-desist letters from the union, instructing them to stop 
performing in productions that weren't sanctioned by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the actors did cease and desist, or else the producers signed on (with 
the plan)," said Equity's Western Regional Director Edward Weston. Other actors 
submitted proof that their productions had actually opened to a paying public 
before Oct. 3, when the plan went into effect, and therefore they could take 
advantage of the plan's grandfather clause. 
</P>
<P>
The first actors to receive cease- and-desist letters, Santa Monica Playhouse's 
Chris DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie, last week submitted proof that their show 
actually opened on Oct. 1, said DeCarlo, despite earlier claims that it opened 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Weston acknowledged that in at least one case, the union took disciplinary 
action beyond the initial letter, but he declined to reveal what action was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the theater operators who belong to Associated Theatres of Los 
Angeles (ATLAS) finally agreed to play by union rules. Will the 
cease-and-desist letters cease? 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope so," Weston said. "It just depends on whether the producers 
actually do sign the agreement (as individual productions arise)." 
</P>
<P>
At least one actor received cease-and-desist letters from Equity's sister 
unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists (supporting Equity in accordance with an inter-union agreement) 
late last week -- after the agreement between Equity and ATLAS was announced, 
but before the theater in question submitted the necessary documents to Equity. 
Speedy delivery of those documents resolved the matter, however, and the actor 
was able to continue performing. 
</P>
<P>
Another Equity member last week berated Weston from his other flank. In a 
letter to Weston (a copy was sent to The Times), Jim Piddock chided Equity 
officials for making 33 revisions of the original plan after talks with ATLAS 
last fall and for allowing individual "concessions" to producers who plead 
special circumstances, such as large casts or small budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"I and a majority of our union voted the plan into effect," Piddock wrote. 
"Now, without my consultation, a lot of what I voted for has been rolled back. 
. . . I question whether it is constitutional for a union to amend its 
majority-elected laws to the whims of a self-interested minority without 
consulting the membership." 
</P>
<P>
Weston responded that Equity's national council "has the right to amend or 
modify any internal rules. Equity policy is to treat each producer individually 
and equitably." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Mark Taper Forum has indicated the Los Angeles theater 
is considering changing its advertisement for its currently running "Dutch 
Landscape." The ad, which ran in last Sunday's Calendar, credits Time magazine 
as giving the play a "Critics' Choice." "Critics' Choice" is the title of a 
Time feature listing plays and other cultural events across the country and is 
not a critical evaluation.

ALAN FEINBERG IN CONTEMPORARY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York pianist Alan Feinberg presented a thoroughly satisfying solo recital 
of mostly American music Tuesday night in Gerald Daniel Recital Hall at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Feinberg -- who last performed in Los Angeles in November with percussionist 
Daniel Druckman -- mastered the intricacies of every score with nonchalant 
technical prowess, demonstrating deep understanding of some very difficult 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The local premiere of Charles Wuorinen's brainy Sonata No. 3, written for 
Feinberg last year, gave the pianist the biggest workout, with layer upon layer 
of serial structures, organized into a three-movement sonata form. Feinberg 
approached the 20-minute work with confidence, conveying complicated motives 
and harmonies with seeming ease. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Sessions' masterpiece of free serialism, the Piano Sonata No. 3 
(1964-65), also proved a test for Feinberg's stamina. Inspired by the 
assassination of John F. Kennedy, the three-movement composition flowed 
seamlessly, stirring deep emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Three works from the 1970s by Feinberg's former teacher, Robert Helps, found a 
more sentimental, melancholy side to his artistry. Two Etudes for left hand 
contrasted duple and triple meters with a precarious chromatic melody given to 
the fifth finger. The purely tonal "Hommage a Faure" also proved a study on 
bringing out a difficult melody. All three were mastered handily by Feinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant, comprehensive performances of Gottschalk's Variations on "God Save 
the Queen" and "Le Chute des Feuilles" opened the program. Feinberg originally 
intended to play three Preludes and Fugues by J. S. Bach, but explained from 
the stage that the instrument he was performing on was more suited for Romantic 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the program was Soviet composer Javanshir Kuliyev's "Seven Pieces With 
Interludes in Mugham Modes"(1980), which Feinberg had played here in 
November.GREGG WAGER

SISTINE CHAPEL CHOIR SINGS AT CHANDLER PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After enjoying something of a boom in the heyday of Roger Wagner, Robert Shaw 
and others, Renaissance choral polyphony is now most commonly encountered on 
campuses. Early music specialists have gravitated to smaller ensembles and ever 
more esoteric repertory, and the large semi-professional choruses tend to offer 
showier, orchestrally accompanied music. 
</P>
<P>
The music of Palestrina and his heirs -- both ancient and modern -- is the 
daily bread of the Sistine Chapel Choir, however. Tuesday the 44 men and boys 
of the Capella Sixtina sang a taut program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
beginning a series of local engagements. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Domenico Bartolucci since 1956, the choir is a flexible, 
well-drilled instrument. Its sound was dominated in the concert hall's acoustic 
by clear, powerful sopranos and occasionally revealed hard edges, surely 
conditioned for a more reverberant environment. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the effectively designed and ordered concert was devoted to 
Palestrina, in unhackneyed examples. Bartolucci began with "Bonum Est," and 
continued with five motets on texts from "The Song of Songs," revealing a 
characteristic penchant for moderate tempos, caressive word painting and linear 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
The post-intermission portion took a more narrowly liturgical direction, 
beginning with Lassus (a stately sung "Jubilate Deo") and Victoria (a deeply 
probing, emotionally exhausting "Caligaverunt"), and ending with more 
Palestrina (a highly stylized account of the Credo from the "Missa Papae 
Marcelli," building to a truly monumental Amen). 
</P>
<P>
In between came three works by Bartolucci himself, clearly formed on 
traditional styles and language but with agreeably quirky idiosyncrasies as 
well. His six-part "Accessistis ad Jerusalem" suggested the influence of 
Eastern Orthodox music, his "Quo Abiit" -- another "Song of Songs" text -- 
employed a deceptively simple soprano solo in an almost folk-like setting, 
while the most conventional was his Marian "Inviolata." 
</P>
<P>
Within this far-from-confining repertory, Bartolucci and his charges proved 
alert to textual and textural nuance. The Sistine intonation sounded piquantly 
untempered -- sometimes simply out-of-tune -- and lines stretched but never 
broke under Bartolucci's almost note-by-note ministrations. 
</P>
<P>
Two encores completed the concert. The choir is also scheduled to sing Friday 
at El Camino College in Torrance, Saturday at Citrus College in Glendora, and 
Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. JOHN HENKEN

'HENRY'S CAT' HAS LITTLE POUNCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Henry's Cat," a new children's series from England that debuts at 5 p.m. today 
on Showtime, demonstrates just how limited limited animation can be. There are 
so many held images of static artwork that the program looks more like a slide 
show than a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
This minimal approach to animation can work if the artwork itself is 
exceptionally beautiful or complex, but the drawings in "Henry's Cat" are 
little more than phone pad doodles, sloppily colored in magic marker. 
</P>
<P>
Clever writing or entertaining voices might have overcome the crude visuals, 
but writer Stan Hayward and designer/director/narrator Bob Godfrey fail to 
establish the title character as a sympathetic figure -- or even one with a 
recognizable personality. A nondescript feline who pursues adventure in his 
daydreams, Henry's cat is such a cipher that it's difficult to care about his 
formulaic fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
The very simple storylines and squeaky-cute narration suggest that the show is 
intended for a very young audience, but American children will probably be 
confused by the references to dustbins, treacle tarts, cream teas and other 
British terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry's Cat" proves just how little programmers in America -- and England -- 
are prepared to offer children as entertainment. CHARLES SOLOMON

THE KITCHEN CABINET: TIME- AND LABOR-SAVING PARAPHERNALIA FOR THE ENTHUSIASTIC 
BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
If you like to bake, it's almost inevitable that your kitchen shelves and 
drawers are loaded with more baking paraphernalia than you'll ever find in the 
average cook's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The collection can range from miniature pastry molds to stacks of cake pans in 
all sizes, not to mention baking aids such as rulers, rolling pins, brushes, 
spatulas and the like. In fact, most of the time you seem never to have enough 
storage space for these odds and ends. Are you ready to read about a few more? 
</P>
<P>
Pie enthusiasts who have discovered Mother Sara's Pie Engravers aren't buying 
them just to create pretty designs on their fruit and meat pie crusts. They're 
also delighted to give them away as presents. The decorative function of the 
engraving tool is second only to its main usage, which is to cut steam vents on 
pastry doughs rolled out for top crusts. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Marsha A. Goetting of Bozeman, Mont., the button-like pastry 
cutters are made of hand-glazed ceramic material and come in several attractive 
colors. A baking fan herself, Goetting created four designs using windmill, 
sunflower, sparkler and snowflake patterns; these are available in mauve, 
yellow, blue, peacock, white, brown and terra cotta. 
</P>
<P>
Goetting suggests twisting the engraver in both directions after pressing down 
on the dough. "This spreads the hole, opening it up to let out more steam," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Roth of Missouri was happy to purchase Mother Sara's ceramic engravers 
after reading about them in a gourmet magazine. He says: "I have been looking 
for these pie engravers for almost 15 years. My mother has an aluminum one that 
she purchased some time in the 1940s and neither she nor any of her five 
children have been able to find another." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Sara's Pie Engravers can be ordered by sending check or money order to 
Pie Engravers, 422 Cutting, Bozeman, Mont. 59715. Cost (includes shipping) is 
$9.95 for one; $16.90 for two; $24.35 for three, and $28.50 for four. For an 
free color brochure write to the same address, or call (406)-586-5259. 
</P>
<P>
In these times of non-stick pans, non-stick parchment -- non-stick anything, 
some serious bakers are still searching for the non-stick-forever solution that 
will smoothly release that cookie, that meringue, that pie, bread, muffin or 
cake from its baking container. Syndicated food columnists Kit Snedaker and 
Marilou Vaughn bumped into the answer to this sticky problem while traveling in 
New Zealand. They found Ceelon Baking Sheets -- actually made here but cut in 
New Zealand -- and brought them back. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought them back as presents," Snedaker says. She and Vaughan were so 
pleased with the sheets that they "decided to import them, knowing about as 
much about imports as we do the high trapeze," Snedaker says. "The sheets are 
meringue's best friend; I've also found great use for them when baking nachos, 
fish and lasagna. For sticky buns, I cut the sheet to fit the bottom of muffin 
cups." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customized Teflon 
</P>
<P>
Brownish in color, the sleek Ceelon Baking Sheets are made of Teflon-coated 
fiberglass. A 17 1/4x14 1/2-inch sheet fits the bottom (the sides don't have to 
be lined) of most cookie sheets and can be trimmed to fit baking and microwave 
pans. The best thing about the sheets is that they are indeed reusable. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll last for years, up to 500 or 600 times," Snedaker says; "but don't cut 
on (the sheets); it'll score the finish and cause the food to stick." In 
addition, the sheets cannot be used for grilling or at temperatures exceeding 
500 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
After using, the baking sheets wipe clean with a damp paper towel. Dishwasher 
proof, the sheets won't be damaged by boiling water or detergents. 
</P>
<P>
Newly named Von Snedaker's Magic Baking Sheet, the product can be mail-ordered 
by sending a check or money order for $10.95 plus tax and $1.50 postage and 
handling to Von Snedaker, 12021 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 231, Los Angeles, Calif. 
90025. Each sheet comes in its own mailing and storage tube. For more 
information call: (213) 395-6365. 
</P>
<P>
Another tool to help you in pie making is the Perfect-A-Crust from Mexitalia 
Enterprises in Brooklyn, New York. One of the worst frustrations encountered in 
attempting to roll and cut out a sheet of dough for pies is not getting a 
perfect measure or thickness. "Pastry boards and cloths have rings drawn on 
them indicating the proper diameter for a pie crust shell but they do not give 
you the proper thickness," says Michael D'Orlando, owner of Mexitalia. "There 
are guide rings that fit on the barrel of a rolling pin that provide you with 
the proper thickness but they do not give you the right diameter." 
</P>
<P>
Perfect-A-Crust ($10.95) consists of a set of three flat plastic molds or rings 
that regulate and measure pie crust shells so you can roll them out into 
uniform thickness and diameter, measuring eight, nine or 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The product works this way: Place the ring over wax paper or pastry cloth. 
Place dough in center of mold and spread lightly with hands. Using rolling pin 
(to prevent sticking, rub with flour or cover with pastry cloth or place wax 
paper over dough) press and roll out dough to edges of mold. Using excess dough 
around edges, fill in the gaps to fully cover inner ring so there are no holes. 
Continue rolling out dough until there is no more excess dough being pressed 
out of mold. Wipe excess dough off mold, smoothing off edges. Remove mold and 
transfer pie crust to pan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perfect-A-Crust is available at Cookin' Stuff (Torrance and La Habra), 
Kitchen Emporium (Del Amo), Village Kitchen Shop (Glendora), Kitchen Aware 
(Montclair) and Kitchen, Kitchen (Rancho Mirage).

BACK TO BASICS: MAKING PERFECT PIE CRUST EASY TASK SURE TO GARNER SMILES OF

<P>
Intimidated at the mere thought of making pie crust from scratch? You have lots 
of company. It seems to rank high on the cooking techniques phobia list. 
</P>
<P>
Actually making pie crust is not that difficult. With a little practice, anyone 
can learn to make a picture-perfect pie with tender, flaky crust. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by using either bleached or unbleached all-purpose flour. Unless the 
recipe directs you to sift the flour, measure by lightly spooning it into a dry 
measuring cup, then level off with a metal spatula. Measure carefully, being 
certain not to shake the cup or pack the flour down. 
</P>
<P>
Salt may be added for flavor but is not necessary to the success of the recipe. 
Blend well with the flour before adding the fat. 
</P>
<P>
Shortening, lard, butter, margarine or oil -- any of these fats will give pie 
crust flavor and flakiness, in addition to promoting browning. Shortening is 
the most commonly used fat, and it creates a flaky texture but doesn't impart 
much flavor. For extra-flaky pastry, chill the shortening 15 to 20 minutes 
before using. Lard adds flavor, creates a flakier texture than most other fats 
and may be used alone or in combination with shortening. 
</P>
<P>
Unsalted butter is recommended over salted butter for baking. It gives both 
color and flavor to a pie crust. Margarine produces a crust similar to that of 
butter but without the butter taste. Both butter and margarine should be placed 
in the freezer 15 to 20 minutes before using and should be combined with 
shortening. Oil produces a tender pie crust but with a mealy texture. 
</P>
<P>
A pastry blender with six to eight arched wires or blades attached to a handle 
(Photo 1) is recommended for cutting fat into the flour. If you don't have a 
pastry blender, two table knives may be substituted, cross-cutting through the 
flour. It's also possible to rub the fat and flour together with your 
fingertips, although the heat from hands can melt the shortening and may 
toughen the pastry. 
</P>
<P>
As the fat particles are broken up, they become coated with the flour. Later, 
as the pie crust bakes, these melt. At the same time, moisture in the dough 
becomes steam and collects in the spaces left by the melting fat, producing a 
flaky pastry. 
</P>
<P>
Because the moisture in flour varies, the amount of water combined with the 
flour-shortening mixture requires some judgment. Enough needs to be added to 
develop the gluten and hold the flour particles together but too much will 
cause the crust to become tough. Either cold or ice water may be used. The 
latter produces an extra-flaky pastry. 
</P>
<P>
Future Back to Basics columns will be devoted to rolling out pie crust, fluting 
the edges and making double-crust and lattice-topped pies. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC PIE CRUST 
</P>
<P>
(For Single-Crust Pie) 
</P>
<P>
1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon shortening or 1/3 cup lard 
</P>
<P>
2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons ice water 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour and salt in medium bowl. Place shortening on top, then using 
pastry blender, cut shortening into flour (Photo 1) until particles are about 
size of small peas or coarse meal. Use relaxed flick of wrist, to keep dough 
mixture from becoming compact mass. If necessary, run finger across inside arc 
of pastry blender to release shortening. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle cold water (Photo 2) 1 tablespoon at time, over flour-shortening 
mixture, tossing lightly with fork to distribute liquid evenly. As water is 
added, flour-shortening mixture will begin to hold together (Photo 3). 
</P>
<P>
Mix only enough so dough sticks together, overmixing results in tough crust. 
When too much liquid is added, pastry becomes sticky, too little and pastry 
will be crumbly. When correct amount of water has been added, form pastry in 
ball (Photo 4) using hands. Roll out immediately or chill from 30 minutes to 2 
days.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: CHOLESTEROL FORMS JUST ONE PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER HEALTH 
PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the last 20 years cholesterol has become a household word. So much so, in 
fact, that manufacturers use it (or more correctly, the absence of it) to 
promote not only vegetable oils and peanut butter but such nutritionally 
questionable items as potato chips and deep-fried corn curls. 
</P>
<P>
The "cholesterol-free" claim used so liberally is accurate. What the 
manufacturers don't bother to say is that whether you buy the cheapest cooking 
oil or the most expensive brand on the shelf, it will contain no cholesterol, 
which is found only in animal foods. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to keeping blood cholesterol in check, dietary cholesterol 
forms just one piece of a picture that even after years of research is still 
not in full focus. A true understanding of the diet serum-cholesterol link 
requires knowledge of several key terms used to describe components of both 
food and blood cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The logical place to start is with cholesterol itself, a waxy substance 
manufactured by our bodies at a rate of about 200 milligrams a day. We need 
cholesterol; it performs central functions in the body. A member of the lipid 
family, which also includes fats, it forms Vitamin D in the skin in the 
presence of ultraviolet light. It is a precursor of essential hormones, and a 
vital part of bile acids. 
</P>
<P>
Cholesterol and fat travel in the blood in different protein-coated packages. 
Two types are especially important when it comes to the risk of heart disease. 
Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which have a thin protein coating and large 
amounts of cholesterol, have come to be known as "bad cholesterol." They carry 
most of the cholesterol and, if not cleared from the blood, cholesterol and fat 
can deposit in the arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which have a thicker protein packaging, carry 
cholesterol back to the liver for processing or for removal from the body. They 
are commonly referred to as "good cholesterol." Several factors within our 
control can affect HDL levels. Quitting smoking, losing weight and increasing 
physical activity all may raise our concentration of HDLs. 
</P>
<P>
When we turn to the task of lowering LDLs, however, the emphasis falls squarely 
on diet. And again, losing weight (if necessary) is helpful. But beyond that, 
the foods we choose are critical. Cholesterol is manufacturered by all animals, 
and that is why we get it from animal foods. Organ meats and egg yolks contain 
the highest amounts. High-fat dairy products, meat and poultry all have 
cholesterol. Shellfish vary in the amount they contain, and fish generally has 
less. 
</P>
<P>
When the diet supplies large amounts of cholesterol, the body obligingly cuts 
back on production, but not enough to compensate. The result: cholesterol 
overload, with rising levels in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
But here is where the emphasis on "cholesterol-free" products is misleading. 
For while dietary cholesterol does influence serum cholesterol, saturated fats 
play a greater role. In fact, they are the most powerful dietary influence on 
serum cholesterol. Besides, making a frontal attack on the saturated fat in 
your diet will, in all likelihood, reduce the amount of cholesterol it 
provides. Saturated fats are found mainly in meat, whole milk, dairy products, 
coconut, palm and palm kernel oils, and lard. Poultry, fish and shellfish also 
contain saturated fat, but generally less than meat. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the unsaturated vegetable oils, including safflower, 
sunflower, corn, soybean, olive and canola oils. Replacing some of the 
saturated fat with these unsaturated fats will help lower your serum 
cholesterol. But remember that even if unsaturated, fats are potent sources of 
calories, packed with more than twice as much as in the same amount of 
carbohydrates or proteins. 
</P>
<P>
How can making these changes help you? Some studies have shown that in adults 
with "high" cholesterol levels (that is, 240 milligrams or over) every 1% 
reduction leads to a 2% reduction in risk of heart attack. Thus, lowering serum 
cholesterol by 15% would reduce risk by as much as 30%.

CULINARY SOS: TAMAYO'S CAKE A CHOCOLATE TREAT DONE LATINO-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: With the great Latino influence in our cooking, I'm sure many of your 
readers would really love to get their hands on a recipe for the chocolate cake 
I had at Tamayo's restaurant in Los Angeles. I do know that it was made with 
Ibarra, a Mexican chocolate. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROSE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ROSE: Delighted. And so was Tamayo's executive chef, David Barber, who 
graciously provided the recipe. Yes, the recipe does use Ibarra chocolate, 
which can be found at any Mexican grocery store or in the Mexican food sections 
of supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>

DEAR SOS: I really would like the recipe for the Creole gumbo I had at the 
Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans. It was once printed in your newspaper and I 
would love to see the recipe again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEAN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JEAN: So would many of our readers, we think, because it's a perfect main 
dish for family or friends during this time of year. File powder, from the 
leaves of the sassafras tree, is a thickening and flavoring agent that often 
replaces or enhances the flavor and texture produced by okra. It is widely 
available at most supermarkets these days.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: CHOCOLATE SYRUP IS GOOD TO THE VERY LAST DROP -- AND THAT'S 
GOOD TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Did you ever want that little bit of chocolate syrup that's at 
the bottom of a squeeze bottle and won't come out? Don't fret, you can get 
every drop. 
</P>
<P>
Fill the bottle with milk and shake it. It mixes with the last bit of 
chocolate. Then just pour it into a glass. You can add more milk if you don't 
like it too dark. 
</P>
<P>
There's usually enough chocolate left in the bottom to make two glasses of 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- THERESA, Monticello, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: While making pancakes for my family, I took a cake-decorating 
tube and filled it up with pancake batter. I decorated each of the cooking 
pancakes with names, pictures and faces, then flipped them. 
</P>
<P>
It is amazing the simple things you can do with your children and have so much 
fun to boot. My children and I had a most enjoyable breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOSEPH, Carlisle, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: A friend mentioned how much her family enjoys the different 
varieties of winter squash. I didn't realize there was winter squash; I don't 
know anything about it. Would you please tell me the different types and how to 
select and store them. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, I can't wait to try some. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARY, Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARY: There are several different types of squash and, oh, what wonderful 
dishes they create. 
</P>
<P>
The acorn squash is shaped like an acorn and, of course, that's how it gets its 
name. It can be dark green or orange and green. 
</P>
<P>
The buttercup squash is oval and is dark green with whitish stripes that run 
down it. 
</P>
<P>
The turban squash is a brightly colored fellow. It has rounded lumps on one 
end. 
</P>
<P>
The butternut squash is long and tubular in shape and is creamy brown in color. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubbard squash is one of the largest squashes. It is bumpy all over and is 
usually all different colors. 
</P>
<P>
The spaghetti squash has a smooth yellow outside. It gets its name because of 
the stringy texture. This is one of my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Most winter squash have hard rinds. When selecting one, be sure to check for 
any soft spots on the rind. Of course, if there are any, look for another. 
</P>
<P>
Winter squash may be kept for three to six months if stored in a cool, dry 
place but don't refrigerate unless it has been cut. 
</P>
<P>
This should just about cover all you need to know. Now all you need is a recipe 
and a squash and you're ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I wear rubber gloves when I wash dishes and do other various 
household chores. I didn't always have such an easy time taking them off, 
though, so now before I put the gloves on, I sprinkle the inside with some 
cornstarch. This makes taking the gloves off much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEEDEE, El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I recently bought some skirt steak and wanted to marinate it to 
make it tender. All of my marinade was gone and I didn't want to go to the 
store, but I saw a bottle of Italian salad dressing and thought I would give it 
a try. 
</P>
<P>
I placed the meat in a shallow baking pan and poured the dressing over the 
steak, covered the pan with aluminum foil and placed it in the refrigerator. 
The next day I broiled the meat and it was simply delicious. My family liked it 
better than my old marinade. So, from now on we will be using the dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SARAH, Phoenix 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I want to share my favorite baked potato topper. I mix two 
tablespoons of sour cream, a spoonful of black olives, some grated onion and 
some fresh chopped parsley. It is delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JENNY, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I grate onions for a recipe, I simply put my hand in a 
plastic bag and grate away. When I am through grating, I put the bag around the 
onion, never touching it. Now my hands remain odor-free and, best of all, the 
onion is ready for the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SALLY, Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy baking chocolate-chip cookies and my family enjoys eating 
them. 
</P>
<P>
When I first began baking the cookies I used one cup of the regular-size chips. 
Now to cut down a few calories but still make the cookies the way my husband 
likes them, I use one-half cup of the mini chips. I think I am the only one who 
noticed any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JACKIE, Orange, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here is my favorite hint. I found the regular spoon rests too 
small for my use, so I purchased a corn holder dish. Mine is plastic but some 
are ceramic as well. 
</P>
<P>
It works great. I now have room for that larger spoon.

DEAR HELOISE: I just love your hints. I look forward to reading them every day. 
They have really helped me a great deal, especially since I recently got 
married. 
</P>
<P>
I have a problem with my garbage disposal. A couple of hours after I have run 
it, it starts to smell. I have tried to cut down on using it but that doesn't 
seem to help the situation. 
</P>
<P>
I would appreciate any suggestions you may have. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LAURA, Austintown, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LAURA: First of all, congratulations on your marriage. Now let's get rid 
of that smelly odor from your garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the garbage disposal switch is in the Off position, then remove the 
rubber piece covering the opening of the sink drain if you can. You will 
probably notice a buildup of gunk on the bottom side of the cover and this 
could be the main source of the odor. Clean this well with hot soapy water and 
replace it over the sink opening. 
</P>
<P>
To freshen the inside of the garbage disposal, save fruit peels (such as orange 
and lemon peels) and once a week deodorize the disposal by placing the peels 
down it and letting it run with plenty of cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My mother shared the following hint with me when I was very 
young, and I still remember and follow it today. 
</P>
<P>
Food should never be stored under the sink area, not even potatoes or onions 
because all of the cleaning products, chemicals or other items can leak or 
spill on any of the stored food. 
</P>
<P>
The pipes that are under the sink can leak on the food and could cause mold or 
mildew to form. I think this is an important hint for all to know and remember. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LESLIE, College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

NEW ORLEANS: WHERE KING CAKE REIGNS;

BAKERIES SHIP SWEET, ROUND CAKES IN GAUDY COLORS ALL OVER U.S.

<P>
People here like to say that you aren't really at home in New Orleans until you 
can stomach king cake, but David Haydel thinks outsiders can develop a taste 
for the unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Haydel and his brother Gary run Haydel's Bakery, one of a number of city 
bakeries ready to ship the cakes -- iced in the three gaudy Mardi Gras colors 
-- anywhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," David Haydel says, "a lady called me and said, 'Honey, I just 
received one of your cakes and it's all green.' I said, 'Darlin,' as long as 
there's gold and purple with it, it's OK."' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaped Like Giant Doughnuts 
</P>
<P>
King cakes, made of sweet dough and shaped like giant doughnuts, taste good. 
It's just that, iced with the traditional colors of the carnival, they don't 
look so good. 
</P>
<P>
They start showing up locally around Christmas time. Haydel says they sell 10 
or 15 a day then and about 3,000 a day during the carnival season. 
</P>
<P>
In France, king cake is served on Epiphany, the 12th night after the birth of 
Christ when the three kings are said to have arrived with gifts. In New 
Orleans, king cake is served daily right up until Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), 
which falls this year on Feb. 7. Local bakers think the tradition can be 
exported to the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we shipped 8,000 king cakes out. That's a big jump from back in 1985 
when we were shipping 75 a day," Haydel says. "This year we expect to do 5,000 
a day." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel ships not only the cake but literature on Mardi Gras and carnival 
trinkets such as plastic beads and aluminum coins called doubloons. Another New 
Orleans baker, Gambinos, has a similar package. 
</P>
<P>
Baked inside each cake is a tiny plastic baby. Tradition has it that the person 
who gets the slice of cake with the baby in it must host the next party. At 
some parties, the person who gets the baby is crowned king or queen. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express now works with five bakeries that ship king cakes, while 
smaller local shipping companies say they are also sending out more of the 
gaudy pastries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot Invested in This' 
</P>
<P>
Haydel's hopes to gross more than $2 million in king cake sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do pretty close to that, we're going to be very unhappy. We've got 
a lot invested in this," Haydel says. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery has spent about $75,000 in national advertising and has installed a 
computer and a toll-free telephone number to handle orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a little bit of Mardi Gras to get a king cake," says Haydel. 
"Carnival is no time to be away from New Orleans, but if you have to be, at 
least you can have a little bit of it sent to you."

Canada will let the United States test an unarmed version of a highly advanced 
cruise missile over western Canada, Defense Minister Bill McKnight said. The 
AGM-129A missile is believed to have greater accuracy and increased range than 
other U.S. air-launched cruise missiles tested over Canada since 1983. McKnight 
said the missile test is expected to be conducted before March 31.

On a unanimous 5-0 vote, a Senate committee voted Wednesday to confirm Gov. 
George Deukmejian's appointment of Robert K. Best as new director of the state 
Department of Transportation. The Senate Rules Committee vote sent the 
49-year-old Best's nomination to the floor of the Senate, where final 
confirmation is expected to be nothing more than a formality. Best, a former 
attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation and a deputy director 
of Caltrans in the 1970s, has been acting head of the state's huge highways and 
transportation agency for the past 10 months, pending confirmation.

The FBI found no evidence that Rep. Donald E. Lukens (R-Ohio) tried to bribe a 
woman who accused him of having a sexual relationship with her teen-age 
daughter, an FBI official said. Dave Hanna, FBI supervisor at the agency's 
Columbus office, said the FBI entered the Lukens investigation in November 
because of a possible federal crime involving a juvenile. He said the 
investigation found no such violation. Television station WBNS in Columbus 
reported that the woman said Lukens offered her a government job after she 
confronted him in November. She reportedly accused him of being involved with 
her teen-age daughter, beginning when the girl was 13. The girl is now 17, the 
station said.

A Polish prosecutor ruled out suspicion of murder in the case of a 
pro-Solidarity priest found dead in his apartment this week. Citing a 
preliminary investigation, prosecutor Tadeusz Sabat said that Father Stanislaw 
Suchowolec, 30, was asphyxiated when an electric heater set fire to a carpet. 
In Warsaw, a church official concurred. "There are still a lot of questions, 
but to a great extent one can say the (electric) stove caused the fire," Father 
Cezary Potocki said. Suchowolec's death, in the city of Bialystok, provoked 
controversy because another pro-Solidarity priest, Father Stefan Niedzielak, 
74, was found dead of a broken neck Jan. 21. The government said the inquiry 
into the latter's death is continuing.

Saudi Arabia reaffirmed its quota policy for the annual hajj pilgrimage to 
Islam's holiest shrines. After rioting in Mecca during the 1987 pilgrimage in 
which 402 people -- including 275 Iranians -- died, the kingdom declared that 
only one person out of every 1,000 in Muslim countries would be allowed to make 
the trip.

NEWSMAKERS: SHE HAD LUCK OF THE IRISH -- AND PATIENCE OF A SAINT

The first woman named as grand marshal of New York's famed St. Patrick's Day 
parade credits her selection to the luck of the Irish. "I was lucky, just 
lucky. God was with me," said an ecstatic Dorothy Hayden Cudahy, who won the 
post after being turned down for three straight years. Cudahy bears no ill will 
toward those who, for 226 years, allowed New York's biggest parade to march 
down 5th Avenue without a colleen at the helm. But she is less forgiving about 
another event unfolding in New York, the arrival of Princess Diana for a 
three-day visit to promote British business. Cudahy vowed to be among those 
protesting British policy in Northern Ireland at a demonstration outside the 
Brooklyn Academy, where Princess Diana was to attend a concert. "We would like 
to inform the princess that not everybody is very happy with the royal family . 
. . maybe she will go over to the North and see why we want the soldiers out of 
Northern Ireland," said Cudahy, 66, known in New York as the first lady of 
Irish radio for the "Irish Memories" program she has hosted on local stations 
for more than 45 years.

 -- Over at the Statehouse in Massachusetts, a beaming Gov. Michael S. Dukakis 
was handing out the cigars and accepting congratulations on the birth of his 
first grandchild. Alexandra Jane Dukakis was delivered safely after a difficult 
pregnancy that forced her mother, Lisa Dukakis, 33, to remain in bed for months 
and abandon the presidential campaign that occupied the rest of the family for 
most of 1988. The new father, John Dukakis, 30, Kitty Dukakis' son from her 
first marriage, managed the Southern primaries for the Dukakis campaign.

 -- The New York City Corrections Department, learning that it had an 
electrical engineer in its midst with the incarceration of subway gunman 
Bernhard H. Goetz, has put his training to work repairing walkie-talkies and 
radios used by the department. Officials report that Goetz, serving a one-year 
sentence for carrying an unlicensed gun in the shooting of four teen-agers he 
said were planning to rob him, is doing an excellent job. His skills reportedly 
led the officials to draft Goetz for a job not normally turned over to an 
inmate. His wages? Fifty cents an hour. ANN CONNORS

Federal investigators for the first time cited a pilot's use of cocaine as a 
contributing factor in a commercial airliner crash in which passengers were 
killed. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that pilot Stephen 
Silver, who was killed in a Jan. 19, 1988, commuter crash in Colorado along 
with eight other people, had used cocaine 10 to 18 hours before the flight left 
Denver. Although investigators said that Silver, 36, did not have enough 
cocaine in his system to have been high and the co-pilot was controlling the 
plane's descent to Durango, the board concluded that cocaine contributed to the 
pilot's "ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach."

OIL DRILLING OFF COAST DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior Department officials have delayed indefinitely plans for offshore oil 
drilling along the Southern California coast so the new Administration can 
review the proposal, according to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), an 
oil-drilling foe. Robert Walker, an Interior Department spokesman, declined to 
confirm that any decision has been made regarding the leasing proposal. But 
another Interior official, who requested his name not be used, confirmed that 
the oil lease plan has been put on hold for an indeterminate period. It remains 
unclear, however, whether the freeze will be a long-term hold or simply a 
temporary delay of a few weeks to allow the Bush Administration time to review 
the proposal.

LESBIAN CUSTODY SUIT ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach woman's lawsuit asking joint custody of a child born to her former 
lesbian lover through artificial insemination can go to trial, a judge has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says that a relative of 32-year-old Terri Sabol was the sperm donor 
that enabled Sabol's then-partner to conceive and on Dec. 16, 1986, give birth 
to the baby girl. But the couple subsequently broke up and the 29-year-old 
mother, who was not identified, allegedly began to limit Sabol's time with the 
child and refused to allow her to help make decisions about her. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred filed suit on behalf of Sabol in Los Angeles Superior 
Court in November, 1987, seeking to establish her rights as a parent. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's attorney, Mitchell Jacobs, sought to have the suit dismissed on 
grounds that the court has no legal authority to consider such a claim. But on 
Monday, Superior Court Judge Richard E. Denner denied the motion. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the court to recognize that this was a family, although not a 
traditional one, and that it would be unfair to deprive our client of contact 
with the child," Allred said.

'PASSWORD' FUGITIVE SUES FOR WINNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fugitive who was arrested after appearing on the game show "Super Password" 
filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Wednesday in an effort to collect his $58,400 in 
winnings, plus $1 million in damages. In his Superior Court lawsuit, Kerry D. 
Ketchem says the show and its producer, Mark Goodson Productions, claim he 
breached the contestant's agreement he signed before appearing on the show 
under the name of Patrick Quinn and have refused to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
Ketchem was arrested at Mark Goodson Productions on Jan. 14, 1988, when he 
arrived to pick up his winnings. An Anchorage banker had spotted Ketchem on the 
show and recognized him as someone suspected of spending $25,000 with 
fraudulently obtained credit cards.

3.8 QUAKE ROCKS WESTSIDE, VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mild earthquake centered in the Pacific Ocean off Malibu rattled windows and 
rocked some homes from Manhattan Beach to the San Fernando Valley at 8:51 p.m. 
Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at Caltech said the magnitude 3.8 temblor was centered 5 miles 
southwest of Point Dume, 15 miles west of the 5.0 quake that hit the area Jan. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Nosker, a waitress at Alice's Restaurant on the Malibu Pier said the 
quake "shook the whole front part of the restaurant. All the windows were 
rattling and everybody stopped talking." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Giroudard, a bartender at Splash Restaurant in Malibu, said he was about to 
"jump over the bar," but the shaking stopped "just as I got one foot over. It 
only rocked for about two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
County firefighters said about five calls came in from the Malibu area, with 
residents reporting that their houses were shaking. 
</P>
<P>
Between six and 12 aftershocks were recorded in the first hour after the quake, 
none measuring above 3.0.

TRUCK JUMPS FREEWAY, SMASHES INTO 2 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North Hollywood residents renewed their pleas Wednesday for a sound barrier 
along the Hollywood Freeway after a flatbed truck loaded with barrels of 
asbestos insulation careened off the roadbed and plowed into two houses. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred north of Saticoy Street shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday. 
The driver fled after asking the startled resident of one of the damaged houses 
on Babcock Avenue to call 911 for help, said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Randy Klucker. CHP investigators were seeking the driver, whose name was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was removed from the back yards of the two houses Wednesday morning 
after the Los Angeles County Health Department determined that none of the 
sealed containers of asbestos had been opened in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
A group of North Hollywood homeowners formed a coalition last July to push for 
construction of freeway sound walls in several locations, including the section 
of freeway that was the scene of the accident, said Bob Brice, a Babcock Avenue 
resident who helped organize the neighborhood.

IZVESTIA ASSAILS SAKHAROV OVER REFORM STANCE 
</P>

<P>
After weeks in which they stood silent before an increasingly critical Andrei 
D. Sakharov, the Soviet authorities struck back Wednesday, accusing the Nobel 
prize-winning physicist and human rights advocate of undermining their reform 
program by making negative statements to the foreign press. 
</P>
<P>
The blow was in the form of an editorial in the government newspaper Izvestia, 
ostensibly responding to comments Sakharov made in an interview published by 
the French newspaper Le Figaro last week. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial's appearance suggested a shift in the complex relationship that 
has evolved between the 67-year-old former dissident and the Kremlin 
leadership, which restored him to official respectability two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia's main complaint appeared to be a statement attributed to Sakharov by 
Le Figaro warning that because Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has failed 
to seek popular support in direct elections, "the conservatives will overthrow 
Gorbachev or at least impose their views on him." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems appropriate to ask on what data this claim is based and what 
arguments there are to save it from (being) political fantasy?" Izvestia 
demanded in a prominent back-page editorial. Using the Russian word by which 
Gorbachev's reform program has become known, the newspaper complained that such 
statements "give rise to all manner of conjectures, which in turn cause 
confusion in the minds, uncertainty and suspicion, which naturally does not 
help perestroika and the transformations themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, told reporters Wednesday that her husband's 
remarks in Le Figaro were taken out of context from what he thought was a 
casual conversation -- rather than an interview -- with a visiting journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia indicated that it was particularly offended at Sakharov's criticisms 
because he has proclaimed himself a supporter of reform, and because he chose 
to criticize its course in the foreign press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some of Same Criticisms 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov was quoted by Le Figaro as stressing that perestroika is "absolutely 
necessary" but that this does not mean "that you have to support Gorbachev 
without reservation." Also, the Izvestia editorial came on the same day that 
the Moscow News, a reform-minded local newspaper, carried an interview with 
Sakharov in which he repeated some of the same criticisms he made to Le Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
"A man who considers himself to be a true supporter of perestroika cannot judge 
it from the positions of an aloof observer," declared Izvestia. It singled out 
Sakharov's protests over the recent arrests of Armenian leaders campaigning for 
the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh and commented, "It would be more logical to 
take actions which will promote further normalization of the situation, rather 
than to cast doubts about the correctness of the measures taken." 
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is the region of Soviet Azerbaijan where 78 people died last 
year in clashes between its majority Armenian population and the minority 
Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenians are mostly Christian while the Azerbaijanis are predominantly 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
While in the past it may have been understandable that Sakharov used "the pages 
of foreign newspapers and microphones to criticize our internal problems," 
Izvestia stated, "this time has passed." Referring to a call in the Le Figaro 
interview for the West to keep holding Moscow strictly accountable for its 
human rights record, it added: "Of course, everyone is free to choose the 
audience and channels of propaganda. But one can hardly agree with the ethics 
of calling upon foreign governments and the public to put pressure on the 
U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
The Izvestia editorial follows weeks of increasing tension between Sakharov and 
the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freed by Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
The physicist, who was exiled to the closed, provincial city of Gorky in 1980 
for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, was released nearly 
seven years later on the personal order of Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
He became both a supporter and a powerful symbol of the Kremlin leader's 
reforms, particularly among Soviet intellectuals and in Western capitalist 
countries, both areas where Gorbachev is anxious to enlist support. 
</P>
<P>
By last November, however, Sakharov was clearly disappointed with the extent 
and pace of democratic reforms. A new election law fell far short of the ideal, 
he said, and it would even give Gorbachev a dangerous monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
There have followed a number of critical interviews in the foreign media, and 
last month he condemned the arrest of the Armenian leaders as a dangerous 
resumption of repression. Sakharov has also called, during an uphill campaign 
to win a seat in a new Soviet legislature, for parliamentary control over the 
KGB secret police, the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
His candidacy is itself a source of potential embarrassment for the 
authorities. After being rejected in a controversial maneuver for one of the 
assured parliamentary seats assigned to the Academy of Sciences, of which he is 
a popular member, Sakharov was nominated for a territorial constituency in 
which the Communist Party's candidate was Politburo member Vitaly I. 
Vorotnikov. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Moscow National-Territorial Election 
District commission confirmed that Vorotnikov had withdrawn his candidacy to 
run in a different district, where he will not face such well-known 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of 15 Nominees 
</P>
<P>
It is still not certain that Sakharov will be accepted for the March 26 ballot, 
the spokeswoman said. He is one of 15 candidates nominated from the district 
for what are billed as the Soviet Union's first-ever multiple-candidate 
national elections. However, it is now up to the party-controlled election 
commissions to finalize the ground rules under which the candidate list is 
whittled down to the anticipated two or three who will actually appear on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Among Sakharov's supporters in the election is a group about which the 
authorities are clearly nervous, a fast-growing, anti-Stalinist movement called 
"Memorial." Sakharov was a featured speaker at Memorial's formal, founding 
convention last weekend. The Kremlin sees in the group the potential of a 
nationwide political movement that would be outside Communist Party control. 
</P>
<P>
While the Izvestia editorial makes clear that the authorities are concerned 
enough about Sakharov's criticisms to at least respond, they apparently aren't 
anxious for open warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want least of all is for all this to be regarded as criticism or 
admonition," Izvestia wrote. However, it added, "neither is it appropriate to 
keep silence on matters of principle."

SHAMIR RENEWS OFFER OF AUTONOMY TO ARABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir outlined a Middle East peace plan Wednesday that 
repeats his longstanding offer of autonomy for Palestinians, while declining to 
hint whether such autonomy would end in perpetual Israeli rule of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's comments to reporters were the clearest sign in weeks that he is not 
ready to budge from positions that have been rejected by the Palestinians and 
that have left Israel isolated internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Israel is prepared to offer "full autonomy" to the 
Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza during an interim period leading to 
final talks. His outline was based squarely on the 1978 Camp David Accords 
between Israel and Egypt, which Shamir has steadfastly used as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops Would Pull Back 
</P>
<P>
Shamir added that during the period of autonomy, designed to last for five 
years, the Israeli army would pull out of big cities in the West Bank and Gaza, 
as stipulated in the Camp David Accords. "There will be some concentration of 
our troops in specified locations not including big centers of population," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply convinced that the moment we can get to this stage and 
negotiations will start, positive results will come," Shamir concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who asked Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, to characterize the 
significance of the prime minister's remarks were told: 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was reiterating his readiness to implement Camp David and 
grant the Palestinians full autonomy." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed as to whether Shamir has ever before so explicitly stated the terms of 
what he is prepared to accept, Pazner answered: "He always spoke like this. 
People just don't listen." 
</P>
<P>
Arab reaction was negative. Faisal Husseini, considered the top pro-PLO leader 
in the occupied lands, said: "Compared to his old stand, he has moved a step, 
but it is a far step from meeting the demands or conditions of the Palestinian 
people. We can't accept it." 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization, according to a report from Tunis, where 
the group's leaders reside in exile, considers Shamir's plan warmed-over Camp 
David and a ploy to control the West Bank and Gaza forever. 
</P>
<P>
"I advise Mr. Shamir to stop digging into his old stock and bringing out these 
goods which are out of date. . . . No Palestinians or Arabs will speak to him 
on this basis," PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman told the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
A skeptical official at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, who asked not to be 
identified by name, commented, "Shamir is toying with trial balloons, trying to 
make old positions seem new." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, in giving a skeletal version of the Camp David schedule, said: "The 
peace process will be composed of two stages. The first stage will be interim 
conditions, and this will include full autonomy, etc. The second stage will be 
direct negotiations, without any preconditions between Israel, the Palestinian 
Arabs and some Arab countries, if they will join the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
"Full autonomy" means local self-rule for Palestinians while Israel controls 
the land and borders. The phrase "without preconditions" is shorthand for 
Shamir's resistance to a guaranteed surrender of all or part of the West Bank 
and Gaza in return for a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has the right to dictate the final outcome," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
That statement was an evident rejection of demands by the PLO for an 
independent state, as well as to American calls for Israel to give up at least 
some part of the land, which might then be attached to neighboring Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has been under heavy pressure to come up with a peace plan since last 
fall, when the PLO began new diplomatic moves aimed at convening international 
peace talks on the Middle East. Words of moderation from PLO leaders netted the 
group talks with the United States and renewed stature in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO wants to be a party to any talks; Israel refuses to meet with the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, top Israeli officials have given confused signals as to how 
Israel will respond to the fluid diplomatic scene. Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin has tried to open avenues of contact with pro-PLO Arabs in the West Bank 
and Gaza. Shamir, while not criticizing Rabin, says these moves are just 
Rabin's private "ideas" and not a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's spokesman, Pazner, was asked whether the peace outline issued 
Wednesday is the final framework for the government's peace plan that Shamir 
has promised since he began his second term as prime minister last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," he replied. "This will come later." 
</P>
<P>
Washington responded cautiously to Shamir's remarks. A State Department 
official spokesman declined to evaluate them. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli critics predicted that a peace plan based on an open-ended view of Camp 
David would go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a non-starter," said Abrasha Tamir, who was an adviser on security 
affairs to the Israeli government when it worked out the Camp David agreement.

WRIGHT PLANS VOTE ON LESSER PAY INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSES 30% RAISE; POLLS SHOW MOST IN HOUSE FAULT 50% HIKE

House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) will announce today that he has scheduled a 
vote for next Thursday on a proposal to scale back the pending pay increase for 
members of Congress to 30% and combine it with a ban on speaking fees, sources 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The vote will take place one day after a 50% pay increase, which former 
President Ronald Reagan proposed last month, takes effect unless Congress 
rejects it before then. Wright has blocked a vote on the raise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Urge Other Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Federal judges and several thousand top executive branch officials will also 
receive substantial raises Wednesday, and sources said that Wright is likely to 
propose reducing the raises of the executive branch officials as well. The 
Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing judicial salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources predict that neither the House nor the Senate will 
approve Wright's proposal to scale back Congress' pay raise to 30%, but recent 
polls have shown that most House members oppose the full 50% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Wright decided on the 30% proposal in response to many complaints from members 
of both parties about his decision not to put the 50% proposal to a vote. He 
recently has been polling members of Congress to determine whether they want to 
vote on the issue before the 50% hike takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Michel Backs 25% 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Wright's latest strategy does not have the support of House 
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who has urged the Speaker to propose 
an increase of no more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The 50% increase would raise the salary of members of Congress to $135,000 from 
$89,500. A 30% increase would yield a salary of about $116,000 and would 
precisely compensate House members for the loss of honorariums, which, under 
current rules, may total no more than 30% of their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
However, senators may receive speaking fees and other honorariums equal to 40% 
of their pay, and Wright's 30% raise could mean a loss of income for them. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's proposal for a 30% hike would be combined with a package of reforms in 
addition to the complete ban on honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran members of Congress no longer would be able to convert their leftover 
campaign contributions to their personal use when they retire. And members of 
Congress could no longer earn some forms of outside income, such as lawyers' 
fees; and other forms, such as farming profits, would be limited to 50% of 
their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress Polled 
</P>
<P>
Details of Wright's plan came to light as a new poll indicated that a majority 
of House members opposes the 50% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of House members, conducted by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, 
indicated that 62% of them are opposed. A majority of Senate members is known 
to oppose the raise as well. 
</P>
<P>
As for members of the California delegation in the House, a Times survey showed 
15 opposed to the pay raise, 9 in favor of it, 7 undecided and 14 unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
These surveys pointed up what critics have portrayed as hypocrisy on the part 
of House members who want to accept the pay hike without casting a vote. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen. Gordon J. 
Humphrey (R-N. H.), a congressional gadfly, likened those who want the money 
without casting a vote to "cockroaches (that) run from a bright light." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "What a perfect system for evading accountability. We get the dough 
and leave no footprints." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) said the pay raise is creating a bad image 
for members of Congress. "The people are saying the Congress is a bunch of 
crooks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nader survey -- as well as a similar poll conducted by the Associated Press 
showing that 88% of House members want to vote on the pay issue -- were 
particularly controversial in light of the announcement by Wright Tuesday that 
he was privately polling members to determine whether they want an opportunity 
to reject the raise. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson, a spokesman for Wright, said that the Speaker's announcement was 
intended "to dispel the notion" that not voting on the pay raise by Wednesday 
"is a one-man decision." 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, California's two senators -- Democrat Alan Cranston and 
Republican Pete Wilson -- have indicated that they intend to vote against the 
50% pay raise, but neither senator has yet decided whether he will accept the 
money if it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has accepted previous pay hikes; Wilson gave the most recent $12,500 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Livingston, a spokesman for Wilson, said that, although the senator 
opposes the raise on grounds that it would add to the federal budget deficit, 
he has not decided whether he will turn down the entire pay raise if the Senate 
votes also to ban honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson accepted more than $30,000 in honorariums in 1987, the last year for 
which reports are available. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, described the issue of whether the 
senator will accept the money as "hypothetical." 
</P>
<P>
In the House, the survey by Nader, who is an outspoken opponent of the pay 
increase, showed that 270 House members would vote against the pay increase, 47 
would vote in favor of it, 41 are undecided and 75 did not respond. There are 
two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nader Poll Figures 
</P>
<P>
Nader's poll on the California delegation showed 16 members opposed, 9 in 
favor, 14 undecided and 6 unavailable. Nader's totals and those of The Times 
differed somewhat based on shifts in the undecided ranks and differences in 
those who could be reached, but both tallies put the largest number of members 
in the opposed category. 
</P>
<P>
In the Times survey, the 15 representatives opposing the pay raise are Glenn M. 
Anderson (D-San Pedro), George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), Tom Campbell (R-Palo 
Alto), C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton), Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), David Dreier (R-La Verne), 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Wally Herger (R-Yuba City), Duncan L. Hunter 
(R-Coronado), Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), Ron 
Packard (R-Carlsbad), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Norman D. Shumway 
(R-Stockton). 
</P>
<P>
The nine favoring it are Jim Bates (D-San Diego), Tony Coelho (D-Merced), 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento), George Miller (D-Martinez), Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), 
Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Representatives saying that they are undecided are Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los 
Angeles), Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger), Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), Norman Y. 
Mineta (D-San Jose), Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), Charles Pashayan Jr. 
(R-Fresno) and William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
Representatives unavailable were Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), Howard 
L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Douglas H. Bosco (D-Occidental), Barbara Boxer 
(D-Greenbrae), Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), Mervin M. Dymally (D-Compton), 
Don Edwards (D-San Jose), Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai), Tom Lantos (R-San 
Mateo), Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), Al 
McCandless (R-Bermuda Dunes), Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and Esteban E.

31 VICTIMS AIRLIFTED ABROAD;

<P>
CHILDREN'S WOUNDS SHOW AGONY OF AFGHAN CONFLICT

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her face was filled with the horror of war, her body torn apart by its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But even with her leg bone exposed by the shell that ripped through her as she 
played on a Kabul street more than seven months ago, 6-year-old Aquila sat in 
stoic silence Wednesday at the Kabul International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
So did 14-year-old Abdul Farid, who sat beside her. Farid lost his right eye 
and arm when a land mine blew up in his neighborhood. And there wasn't so much 
as a wince out of Abdul Munir, 12, as he recalled the day four months ago that 
a magnesium flare exploded and burned off his face and hands. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 Afghan children assembled at the airport Wednesday afternoon had a great 
deal in common. They are all war wounded, innocent victims of one of the 
world's longest and most intractable wars. They are all scarred for life 
because Afghanistan's medical care, like so much in this impoverished nation, 
simply cannot cope with the level of human devastation that a nine-year 
guerrilla war has wrought. 
</P>
<P>
Most of their wounds are old -- mistreated or untreated -- and more than a 
third are infected to the very marrow of the bones, just as the Afghan war has 
eaten into the core of this nation's next generation. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 children were the fortunate few selected for a medical airlift to West 
Germany by an apolitical, nonpartisan international aid foundation called Peace 
Village International. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care about the politics -- whoever is going to rule this country, we 
don't care," said Dr. Eberhard Thoma, the German physician who had spent 10 
days in Kabul examining and selecting the children most in need of treatment 
abroad. "We believe only that these children are wounded. We don't care by whom 
they were wounded or why." 
</P>
<P>
The individual tragedies assembled on Afghan Airlines Flight 314 Wednesday 
offered only a glimpse of this war, but they represent the stark human side of 
the conflict that has raged relentlessly since even before Soviet troops were 
sent into Afghanistan in the winter of 1979. It is a perspective that has been 
all but lost in the recent weeks of political maneuvering as the Soviets 
approach their final week of a U.N.-mediated troop withdrawal that began last 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, most of the horror stories of the war have come out of the 
Pakistani border city of Peshawar, the headquarters for 3.2 million Afghan 
refugees who have fled the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The families of Aquila, Abdul Farid and Abdul Munir did not flee. They remained 
in this beleaguered capital throughout the rocket and artillery barrages, the 
mining operations and the urban guerrilla attacks of the U.S.-backed 
moujahedeen, the Afghans fighting the Soviet troops and the Moscow-backed 
Afghan government. In fact, war is all that most of these children have ever 
known -- war and the shortages that it has produced in a nation that already 
ranked among the world's three poorest. 
</P>
<P>
"For each child, the story is basically the same," Thoma said. "They were on 
their way to school or out playing. They were in the street. They were in the 
house. They were in a bus, and that was it. Something exploded, and they were 
injured by coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
The stories are always compounded by Afghanistan's crushing poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen things in the past 10 days in Afghanistan that I have never in my 
life seen -- and hope I never see again," Thoma said in an interview on the 
flight out of Kabul. "There simply isn't enough of anything here. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen compound fractures that couldn't be set because there is no plaster 
of Paris. I've seen raw bones left exposed for months because there was nothing 
to wrap them with. I've seen the small feet and arms of children grown deformed 
because there was nothing to set them with. And almost always, the neglect has 
resulted in bone marrow infections. It is just such a poor country, you cannot 
imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Thoma added, however, that the lifelong poverty has hardened the children now 
under his care. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is because they have so little that they expect so little and are so 
calm about what this war has done to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is against this backdrop of poverty that, after the last Soviet 
soldier leaves Kabul, the embattled Afghan government will wage war against the 
Islamic guerrillas, who have received $2 billion in arms, ammunition and 
supplies from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And it is because of this poverty that the parents of the 31 war-wounded 
children agreed to entrust them to the German aid mission for long-term care 
and repair. 
</P>
<P>
Thoma said that most of the children will remain at hospitals or at the peace 
village complex in Oberhausen, West Germany, for six months to a year to undo 
the damage. Bones will be reset, marrow infections will be treated with 
antibiotics, a rare commodity in Kabul, and plastic surgeons and prosthetic 
experts will attempt to repair or replace the scarred, incinerated skin and 
amputated limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"In every case, though, these children will be returned to Afghanistan when 
they are well, no matter what group is in power," Thoma said. "These are not 
refugees. These are innocent children. How can innocent children have an 
ideology? And yet it's always the innocent, the children and the civilians, who 
suffer most from war."

A military judge Wednesday convicted a Marine sergeant of negligence for his 
actions following the abandonment of a Marine who died in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Christopher Clyde was the platoon sergeant of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, who 
was left behind after being posted as a road guide for an exercise near 
Twentynine Palms last Aug. 30. The remains of Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, were 
not found until December. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Kent Smith, the military judge, ruled that Clyde was negligent by failing 
to follow policies, failing to report the status of his Marines and to properly 
account for the whereabouts and the welfare of his troops. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde was found not guilty of willful disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentencing Delayed 
</P>
<P>
No sentencing has been scheduled, and a military hearing was held Wednesday 
afternoon to outline possible penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde, 28, of Mentor, Ohio, showed no emotion as Smith read the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde had been charged with dereliction of duty and failing to obey an order to 
not give time off to his men. Clyde had maintained that he did nothing wrong 
and that he only reacted to the instructions of his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's guilty of anything, he's guilty of relying on other people," defense 
attorney William Fisher said in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Robert Nunally had urged Smith to convict Clyde. 
</P>
<P>
"He screwed up and he screwed up in a major way," Nunally said in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
A court-martial was scheduled to begin Thursday for Sgt. Thomas B. Turnell, 
Rother's squad leader. 
</P>
<P>
Turnell, 25, of Elrama, Pa., is charged with dereliction of duty, willful 
disobedience of a lawful order and unauthorized absence. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing charges is 1st Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who is scheduled for a 
court-martial on Feb. 7. He was in charge of assigning road guides during the 
exercise.

Deukmejian Administration budget proposals to spend $625 million in new tobacco 
tax revenues for health and other programs came under fire Wednesday from both 
the tobacco industry and proponents of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industry spokesmen, during a hearing of the Senate Revenue and Taxation 
Committee, said it is a mistake for Gov. George Deukmejian to count on raising 
$625 million because of a legal challenge to Proposition 99's required increase 
in taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
The industry representatives also said the Proposition 99 tax rate of 41.67% on 
the wholesale price of cigarettes is so high that the Administration's expected 
windfall will never develop because smokers will smoke less and be encouraged 
to buy their tobacco products from mail-order firms in states that do not have 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 99 attacked the Administration for proposing to use 
the new revenues to fund a variety of programs that are now financed from 
general tax revenues. They argued that the governor's budget proposals violate 
a provision of Proposition 99 prohibiting use of the money "to supplant 
existing levels of service." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Administration officials insisted that their revenue projections as 
well as their reading of Proposition 99 are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Mathis, chief of financial research for the Department of Finance, said 
the Administration expects only a 2% reduction in smoking as a result of higher 
prices. That expectation, he said, is based on a belief that people who smoke 
today are "hard-core smokers" who do not plan to quit no matter what the price. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think a penny a cigarette is going to have a real significant impact 
on those people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two committee members said they agree with critics that the Administration 
budget proposals violate provisions of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), the committee chairman, said he thinks 
the Administration "is asking the Legislature to do something that is 
apparently illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), said he also 
thinks the Administration is trying to misuse Proposition 99 funds and asked 
for a formal legal opinion from the Legislature's chief lawyer. Preparation of 
the opinion could take several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Services Plan 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over whether Deukmejian is proposing to use Proposition 99 money to 
finance continuing state programs centers chiefly on a new plan to finance 
health services for poor Californians with $331.3 million in cigarette tax 
money. Deukmejian is also proposing to trim $358 million from a health program 
for the same patient group that is financed with general tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi told John Ramey, deputy secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency, 
that he thinks the Administration "eliminated the old program and started a new 
one and substituted the source of funds using the cigarette tax. I think that 
is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Ramey said, "We don't believe that we are asking the Legislature to do 
something that is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Nethery, a dentist and chairman of Coalition for a Healthy 
California, sponsors of Proposition 99, accused the Administration of playing 
"a shell game." 
</P>
<P>
"The wording of the initiative is very clear. The funds are not to be used to 
replace existing programs, and there is no question in my mind that is exactly 
what is happening in this case," Nethery said. He said that the coalition would 
file a suit to block the spending proposal if the Legislature accepts the 
governor's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 99, during their turn before the committee, said they 
have already filed suit on the grounds that they believe the tax increase is 
illegal because it was not approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Doerr, a tax specialist for the California Taxpayers Assn., told 
committee members not to count on seeing the money because it is possible that 
the courts will rule in the tobacco industry's favor. Doerr said the California 
Constitution prohibits voters from raising taxes in any way other than through 
a constitutional amendment. Proposition 99 raised the tax by changing a statute 
in the tax law. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Finance officials estimate that most of the revenue from 
Proposition 99, $595 million, will come from the tax increase on cigarettes and 
that about $30 million will come from sales of cigars, pipe tobacco and other 
tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Sharp, a spokesman for the Cigar Assn. of America and the Pipe Tobacco 
Council, predicted that "the $30 million will never materialize" because 
smokers will either quit or buy tobacco products by mail order. He said sales 
of pipe tobacco and cigars have declined 76% over the last 25 years.

POLAR EXPERTS EASE DOUBTS OVER TAINTED PEARY CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polar explorer Robert E. Peary, whose legacy has been suspended in limbo the 
past few months as scholars debated whether he should be ranked as one of the 
nation's leading heroes or one of its greatest frauds, got a little help 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Navigation Foundation said a mysterious document that surfaced 
last October does not prove Peary lied when he claimed to have "discovered" the 
North Pole in 1909. The foundation concluded further that the numbers scrawled 
on the piece of "scratch paper" were grossly misinterpreted and, moreover, were 
not even from that expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation studied the document at the request of the National Geographic 
Society, which financed Peary's expeditions, because of growing doubt about the 
explorer's claims. While it concluded that the document does not prove Peary a 
fraud, the foundation also said it tells "absolutely nothing about whether 
Peary reached the pole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis for Doubts 
</P>
<P>
The debate has intensified in recent months, due partly to the society's 
National Geographic Magazine, which published an article in September by 
British polar explorer Wally Herbert that questioned whether Peary actually 
reached the pole. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is harsher now than it was a few years ago, but it is not new. It 
began almost as soon as Peary returned from the frozen north 80 years ago. It 
has been fueled partly by a lack of evidence to support Peary's claim that he 
reached the pole with five companions and spent 30 hours there in an ice igloo 
that the six men built. 
</P>
<P>
In his National Geographic article, Herbert said he was "dismayed" that Peary's 
handwritten diary contained several blank pages covering the time when he 
claimed to have been at the pole, and there were no entries about activities 
during that period. Particularly troubling has been the lack of sextant 
readings that would have pinpointed Peary's position. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a loose piece of paper had been inserted in the diary, declaring "The 
Pole at last!!!" 
</P>
<P>
Herbert said present understanding of currents and ice drift suggests Peary 
could have been as much as 30 to 60 miles off course and his "astonishingly 
slack" navigational records make it impossible to determine whether he actually 
reached the pole. Since the North Pole is covered by the drifting polar ice 
pack, celestial navigation was the only way for Peary to determine his 
location, and the lack of records by Peary fueled the current debate. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have insisted that Peary may have erred -- and possibly toyed with 
the facts -- when he realized that warming temperatures and supply shortages 
were making his fifth attempt too dangerous and he knew he would never have 
another chance to reach his lifelong goal. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert, while concluding that the evidence is so inconclusive that the truth 
may never be known, suggested that Peary may have felt justified if he fudged a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
"In all probability, during those last five marches northward Peary was being 
driven not by the rational mind but by a conviction that the pole was his and 
that he had the divine right to discover it and return to proclaim his 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, astronomer Dennis Rawlins of Baltimore, who published a book in 1973 
in which he argued that Peary probably never reached the pole, came across a 
document that changed the entire tone of the debate. While researching another 
matter at the National Archives, Rawlins found a slip of paper that had been 
placed in the archives long after Peary's death. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, in an envelope dated 1909, had a series of numbers scrawled on it, 
and astronomer Rawlins said he recognized them as readings from a sextant Peary 
used to determine his position while at his northernmost point. 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins said the readings revealed that Peary never got farther than 88 degrees 
15 minutes north, which would place him about 121 statute miles from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins said the paper proved that Peary, a U.S. Navy admiral who died in 1950, 
knew he had failed to reach the pole and he suppressed that fact to claim a 
fraudulent victory. 
</P>
<P>
The document became available in 1984, when Peary's descendants unsealed his 
files, but no one paid any attention to it because it contained numbers that 
only someone familiar with celestial navigation would recognize. 
</P>
<P>
There the matter stood until Wednesday, when the Navigation Foundation released 
an interim report on Rawlins' conclusions. After studying the document, the 
foundation concluded that "Rawlins' analysis is clearly incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
The date, 1909, that had been scrawled on the envelop by someone other than 
Peary, was incorrect, the foundation concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Rear Adm. Thomas D. Davies, president of the foundation, said three 
experts evaluated the document and concluded it was not even from the 1909 
expedition. 
</P>
<P>
While examining the files, the investigators found a letter in which Peary's 
daughter, Marie Stafford, said that her mother admitted she may have made a 
mistake when she dated the envelope April 7, 1909 -- the day Peary claimed to 
have reached the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Davies said the document amounted to "scratch paper," apparently used by Peary 
to calibrate his instruments on an earlier polar expedition in 1906, Davies 
told a press conference Wednesday at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
According to Davies, Rawlins mistakenly thought numbers on the slip of paper 
represented compass readings, but in fact they were "time sights" used to check 
the accuracy of Peary's three chronometers, precise timekeeping instruments 
used by navigators. Furthermore, the slip refers to the star, Betelgeuse, which 
Peary could not have seen in April of 1909, the foundation concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins made the mistake, Davies said, because "he clearly was not trained in 
navigation." 
</P>
<P>
"This piece of paper provides no evidence Peary faked his claim," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Rawlins conceded that the foundation had found 
several mistakes in his interpretation of the document. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (the foundation's investigation) a competent piece of work which presents 
an alternative interpretation," Rawlins said. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted, however, that Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole is 
unfounded.

DEAD SEA LIONS WASH UP IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three more dead sea lions washed ashore in Orange County Wednesday, bringing to 
23 the number of beached carcasses found in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One dead sea lion was found in Huntington Beach Wednesday morning, according to 
the National Marine Fisheries Service. Another washed up in Sunset Beach and a 
third in the Surfside area of Seal Beach, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the dead mammals washed ashore at Huntington Beach on Jan. 21, and 
one or more new bodies have drifted ashore virtually every day since then, said 
Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service 
office in Los Angeles. Before Wednesday, all of the dead animals were found at 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Some marine mammal experts recalled other sea lion beachings in recent years 
but noted that they had come to shore alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know what is killing them or where at sea they are dying," 
Cordaro said. He added that he does not think sharks have caused any of the 
deaths. "If the sea lions had been attacked by sharks, you'd see whole sections 
torn from their bodies, and we haven't seen this." he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro said the sea lion found at Huntington Beach on Wednesday washed ashore 
about half a mile south of the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a sea lion 1 to 2 years old," he said. "Most of the head was missing. 
It was a very decomposed body." 
</P>
<P>
A 4-foot-long, 50-pound sea lion found Tuesday at Huntington Beach had been 
dead at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A sick sea lion was found at Sunset Beach on Saturday, but Cordaro said he did 
not believe that beaching was related to the other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
That animal died of kidney and liver failure Sunday at Sea World in San Diego. 
A Sea World spokesman estimated that the animal was more than 20 years old and 
described its condition as "typical of an old sea lion ready to die." 
</P>
<P>
Some beach-goers have reported seeing what they thought were bullet wounds on 
several of the carcasses, but Cordaro said sea birds could have made the holes. 
</P>
<P>
Several headless sea lions have been found, leading some environmentalists to 
speculate that fishermen had cut the heads off while freeing the mammals from 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
But Cordaro said the heads may separate from the decomposing bodies in the 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
Sea lions are protected under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Fishermen 
are allowed to kill them when they endanger their catch, said James Lecky, 
chief of the protected species program at the National Marine Fisheries 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,600 sea lions die each year from "interaction with fishermen" -- 
sometimes shot, sometimes tangled in their nets, Cordaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, sea lions are thriving from San Diego to British Columbia. Their 
population is estimated at 87,000, double that of 10 years ago and growing by 
5,700 a year. Sea lions were nearly extinct at the turn of the century because 
of commercial hunting. 
</P>
<P>
The animals are so plentiful now that fishermen regard them as pests. But Nello 
Castagnola, president of the California Gillnetters Assn., which represents 100 
commercial fishermen, said he doubts that a fisherman would cut off a sea 
lion's head to free it from a net.

QUAYLE OPPOSES 'DEBTOR CARTEL'

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, arriving Wednesday on his first visit to Latin 
America, discussed anti-drug efforts with Colombia's president and declared 
U.S. opposition to any Latin "debtor cartel." 
</P>
<P>
The vice president arrived a day before inaugural ceremonies for Venezuela's 
new president, Carlos Andres Perez. His met first with President Virgilio Barco 
Vargas of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle mostly listened as Barco talked about Colombia's fight against drugs and 
guerrillas "and how much help they need from the United States," said Quayle's 
press secretary, David Beckwith. Quayle told Barco that U.S. resources to help 
out are limited. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the busy capital by motorcade, Quayle created a cacophony of 
horn-honking when he stopped to buy bananas, guavas and mangoes at a small 
market. "Stimulating the economy already," he joked to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said on arrival that his primary mission is to be "a cheerleader for 
democracy." But the massive debt owed by Latin countries is expected to 
dominate the discussion among two dozen heads of state attending the 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle indicated the United States is maintaining a hard line on so-called 
debtor cartel movements to form a unified organization of Third World nations 
that face huge national debts.

JEWISH DOVES SEE NEED TO CRITICIZE ISRAEL

<P>
Dovish members of the international Jewish community agreed here Wednesday that 
there is a need to speak out against Israeli policy in dealing with the 
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
They took this position at a private conference on the Israeli-Palestinian 
problem set up by the Middle East Dialogues, a Dutch foundation. The session, 
which ends today, is being attended by Palestinians as well as Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Drora Kass, director of the New York office of the International Center for 
Peace in the Middle East, was a member of the American Jewish delegation that 
met last December in Stockholm with leaders of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. She recalled the criticism she received at the time from fellow 
American Jews, but she said the meeting may have encouraged PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat to take a more moderate line in a speech to a meeting of the U.N. 
General Assembly later that month in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Questions 
</P>
<P>
Other American Jews, she said, raised such questions as "How can you talk to 
murderers?" and "Whom do you represent?" But the most frequently asked 
question, she said, was "Is the PLO really sincere?" 
</P>
<P>
Kass said she believes that concerned Jews have not only a right but also a 
duty to speak out for peace in the occupied territories -- the West Bank of the 
Jordan River and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
And she argued that American Jews should articulate their disagreement with 
Israel's tactics in suppressing the nearly 14-month-old Palestinian uprising. 
Otherwise, she said, Israeli leaders will not get an accurate impression of the 
anti-violence sentiments held by most American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Kass said it was the failure of American Jews to object to Israeli policy, out 
of what she called a misguided desire to maintain Jewish unity, that led 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to say on returning from visiting the 
United States that "all American Jews are behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Henneke Gelderblom, a Dutch senator, said she believes that PLO leaders crossed 
a "psychological barrier" in accepting Israel's right to exist as a state. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jews should do it as well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
David Susskind, a leader of the Jewish community in Belgium, said: "You cannot 
be a free people when you rule other people. I feel very unhappy, very guilty 
in the name of my people, when we have to kill other people." 
</P>
<P>
Marie-Claire Mendes-France, French chairman of the International Center for 
Peace in the Middle East, urged Shamir to meet with Arafat to seek a permanent 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance for peace must be seized now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most speakers indicated that they are in favor of an independent Palestinian 
state as the only realistic way to a lasting peace. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy in the Middle East came under fire from a retired American 
diplomat, Richard Parker. A former ambassador to Lebanon, Algeria and Morocco, 
Parker told the conference that in order to be effective, the United States 
will have to accept the idea of an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagrees With Shultz 
</P>
<P>
He said that former Secretary of State George P. Shultz was wrong in supporting 
the Israeli government's view that there is no room for an independent 
Palestine in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomacy under Shultz, Parker said, "kept talking about 
self-determination for the Palestinians, but would then tell the Palestinians 
that it did not mean the right to an independent state." 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell does it mean?" Parker asked. 
</P>
<P>
He warned the Palestinians to avoid making "extreme remarks" in their current 
diplomatic offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"You will be held to very high standards," he said, and he cautioned that the 
American Establishment is "full of people who do not wish you well."

THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's unprecedented trip to Jerusalem in 1977, 
he and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin met in 1978 at the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland for talks sponsored by President Jimmy Carter. 
The result was the Camp David Accords, which were the basis for the 
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 and remain the basis for the Middle East 
peace plan proposed by Israel's current prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir. The 
accords consisted of two major documents, "Framework for a Peace Treaty Between 
Egypt and Israel" and "Framework for Peace in the Middle East." Among the main 
points of the accords: 
</P>
<P>
An end to the state of war between Israel and Egypt and establishment of full 
diplomatic relations, the first between Israel and an Arab nation. 
</P>
<P>
A promise that Israel would withdraw from the Egyptian Sinai, occupied during 
the 1967 Middle East War. Except for one small parcel of land in dispute, this 
has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
A pledge by both sides to open talks -- with Jordan invited, and also with the 
possible participation of Palestinian negotiators -- on the future shape of 
"full autonomy" for the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Upon establishment of an elected Palestinian "self-governing authority" 
in the territories, the Israeli military would be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The first two points were carried out, but the third has yet to get off the 
ground. Jordan has proved reluctant to get fully involved in the peace process, 
and Israel and Egypt differ markedly on questions including the definition of 
terms such as autonomy (in Egypt's view, autonomy would eventually lead to 
Palestinian statehood, to which Israel is opposed). As a result, the promised 
autonomy talks have never taken place, and the Israeli military still controls 
the territories. Four years after Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem, he was 
assassinated.

6 ARABS SENTENCED TO LONG JAIL TERMS AS STONE THROWERS

<P>
A military court sentenced six Palestinians to up to two years in prison for 
throwing stones, and an army official said Wednesday that the unusually harsh 
sentences are intended to deter other youths. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, stone throwers have received only fines or jail terms of several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The sentences for the six ranged from 18 to 24 months in prison, plus suspended 
terms of 18 to 40 months and fines of $417 to $833. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Haaretz said three of the incidents involved stone throwing 
at soldiers. It said the defendants range in age from 15 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the stone-throwing incidents, said the army official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. But he added: 
</P>
<P>
"Stones have the potential of causing death, just like live ammunition. . . . 
The punishment was meted out not only as a punishment but also as a deterrent 
for the defendants and the general public." 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, 10 Arab teen-agers were wounded in clashes with troops in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the head with a 
rubber bullet, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed five wounded.

BUSH REPORTEDLY PICKS EX-CIA OFFICER AS AMBASSADOR TO CHINA 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former 
CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is James R. Lilley, a career intelligence officer who served as CIA 
station chief in China when Bush headed the U.S. liaison office there in 
1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary 
of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, 
ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Richard 
G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment to 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Face Tough Questioning 
</P>
<P>
They said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block 
Aronson's nomination but said that the former Jimmy Carter aide will face tough 
questioning in his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley, 60, was born in China, the son of an American oilman working there. He 
has also served on the National Security Council staff, as head of the 
unofficial U.S. office in Taiwan and as a deputy assistant secretary of state 
for East Asia. He will replace Winston Lord, who has headed the American 
Embassy in Beijing since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Lilley served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea. In 
that job, he was the principal American contact with South Korean leaders 
during the turbulent period when former President Chun Doo Hwan resigned and 
the current president, Roh Tae Woo, won a bitterly contested election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns to Washington 
</P>
<P>
Lilley left Seoul last month and returned to Washington, hoping to be appointed 
as assistant secretary of state in charge of U.S. policy in East Asia and the 
Pacific, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to get that job, in part because newly appointed Deputy 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger opposed him, the sources said. 
Eagleburger was said to have been promoting two other candidates -- Lord and 
U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt -- for the Asian post. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger and Lord served together as aides to former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger.

ANGRY JUDGE SAYS TV COMPLICATES PICKING NORTH JURY 
</P>

Selection of prospective jurors for the trial of former White House aide Oliver 
L. North continued Wednesday after a judge threatened to hold a television 
reporter in contempt of court for purportedly making the process more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell complained that ABC News Correspondent 
Tim O'Brien had shown a news clip of North's 1987 congressional testimony 
Tuesday night while telling viewers that, if they were potential jurors, 
watching the clip could disqualify them. 
</P>
<P>
ABC officials said that the film clip was part of O'Brien's report and that no 
harm was intended. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, in screening prospective jurors in his courtroom, has been especially 
sensitive to whether they saw or read about North's widely publicized 1987 
testimony to Congress. Testifying then under a grant of immunity from 
prosecution, the former National Security Council official made a number of 
disclosures about the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing criminal charges against North, independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh was required by law to build his case on evidence that was independent of 
North's testimony. Gesell has said that he does not want any references to the 
1987 testimony to "taint" the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell angrily charged that O'Brien, in his television report, "took pains" to 
advise viewers that watching the 1987 film clip could be grounds for being 
excused as a juror. Although the judge said that he was considering a contempt 
citation against the newsman, legal sources said that such action is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Most prospective jurors who filled out a questionnaire said that they had seen 
parts of North's testimony two years ago or had read about it. Gesell promptly 
excused them. With a need to impanel 12 jurors and six alternates, it seemed 
likely that the screening process would occupy several more days. 
</P>
<P>
North declined all comment while entering and leaving the federal courthouse. 
However, he tossed off a few one-liners in breakfast remarks to a religious 
group Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he could remain only a few minutes because "I have an appearance 
elsewhere that I have been invited to." He added that "normally in order to 
speak, I have to have a subpoena." 
</P>
<P>
North faces 12 criminal charges, including covering up the scandal.

NEW YORK OFFERS PRINCESS DIANA BOTH PROTOCOL, PROTESTS

Hours before the Princess of Wales stepped off the British Concorde at Kennedy 
Airport on Wednesday, one of her spokesmen tried to give an etiquette lesson to 
New York's hyper-aggressive press corps. 
</P>
<P>
"The Princess of Wales doesn't operate in every way like a President of the 
United States or like a senior political figure," Francis Cornish of the 
British Information Service, explained. 
</P>
<P>
"If people think it would be a good idea to shout questions, I can tell you 
here and now that you won't get an answer. Frankly, you're more likely to get 
the back of her head," he warned. "She will not give any interviews." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Koch Pledges Politeness 
</P>
<P>
New York's normally outspoken Mayor Edward I. Koch pledged, meanwhile, that he 
would be polite and "not rain on her parade." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young woman who has nothing to do but represent the royal family in 
a royal way," Koch said. The mayor said that, above all, he would not bring up 
the touchy subject of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do that," Koch told reporters. "I don't happen to agree with 
the British government's position with respect to Northern Ireland. I believe 
that the phrase 'Brits out of Ireland' still applies. But I'm not going to 
insult this young woman." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Big Apple, Lady Di. 
</P>
<P>
The princess' three-day, high-profile visit is designed to stress social causes 
and to push British products ranging from cashmere sweaters to a toy called 
Thomas the Tank Engine -- a railroad locomotive with a happy smiling face. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-American foes of British rule in Northern Ireland promised to protest the 
visit, especially when the 27-year-old princess attends the Welsh Opera's 
American premiere, a performance of "Falstaff" tonight at the Brooklyn Academy 
of Music. After the final curtain and a backstage visit with the cast, she is 
to be the honored guest at a lavish dinner in the soaring glass and steel 
Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
During her visit to New York, Diana is staying in a flower-filled 
$1,800-a-night deluxe duplex hotel suite with deep red walls with its own 
solarium and terrace -- but without Prince Charles, who remains at home to hand 
out awards to a variety of Britons, including dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The prince and princess receive several thousands of invitations a year in the 
U.K. and abroad," explained Dickie Arbiter, assistant press secretary to the 
queen. "In order to satisfy the thousands of requests that come in, they have 
to split their resources." 
</P>
<P>
Just before dinner time, smiling and looking radiant in a royal blue wool coat 
and a string of pearls, Diana arrived amid heavy security at Kennedy Airport 
and rushed off to her first stop, a reception hosted by a firm that produces 
Scottish cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
She also will promote British toy manufacturers by visiting FAO Schwarz, the 
huge 5th Avenue toy store. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will also stress social problems. Diana will tour the Henry Street 
Settlement's Urban Family Center in Lower Manhattan, a pioneering program 
serving as an alternative to welfare hotels for homeless families, and Harlem 
Hospital's pediatric AIDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people are pretty excited," said Fred Winters, a hospital 
spokesman. "I think all Americans are excited when they meet royalty." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the princess said that her visits to Harlem Hospital and the 
Henry Street shelter were designed to follow up some of her own social 
interests in England. 
</P>
<P>
"She is aware these are problems that loom large on the New York scene," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Prince Charles visited New York some years ago, he was picketed heavily by 
Irish-Americans protesting British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Nassau County Comptroller Peter King, chairman of the Committee for Legal 
Justice in Northern Ireland, said he would lead similar protests outside the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music.

PEGEEN FITZGERALD; EARLY RADIO PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pegeen Fitzgerald, believed to be 78 and part of the first husband-wife radio 
team whose New York City broadcasts for half a century turned her life into an 
ongoing soap opera. Mrs. Fitzgerald's career began in 1937 with a radio station 
owned by a Portland, Ore., department store where she worked. To fill air time, 
she began to broadcast from the store. Her husband was a newspaper reporter who 
had gone into radio in 1933 as a master of ceremonies. After they married, they 
went to New York, where she landed a job on WOR-AM doing a half-hour talk show 
on her lunch hour while working as a department store advertising manager. When 
Mrs. Fitzgerald caught pneumonia, she was asked to broadcast from her hospital 
bed and later from her home while she was convalescing. Because she did not 
want her announcer, Henry Morgan, to see her in a bathrobe, she asked if her 
husband, Edward, could take his place. The husband-wife combination became a 
radio first and was at one time heard by 2 million people in the New York area. 
He died in 1982. In New York of cancer on Monday.

elementary schools in an effort to improve the health and reduce the incidence 
of obesity among schoolchildren.

state budget cycle from one to two years. 
</P>

RELIGIOUS BROADCASTERS ETHICS PANEL PROBING CROUCH'S TRINITY NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of Orange County-based Trinity 
Broadcasting Network, is the subject of an investigation by the ethics 
committee of the National Religious Broadcasters, according to Richard Bott 
Sr., chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, examining some of Crouch's business practices, could lead to 
his expulsion from the voluntary organization. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been allegations, which we are looking into," Bott said before this 
week's National Religious Broadcasters convention in Washington. Other sources 
in the organization confirmed this week that an inquiry is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Bott, president of Bott Broadcasting in Independence, Mo., declined to provide 
details, but according to a 17-page complaint submitted to the ethics committee 
-- copies of which have been provided to The Times -- the allegations focus on 
Crouch's acquisition and building of new television stations over the past 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin-based Trinity network has undergone spectacular growth in the past 
16 years. The network and subsidiary organizations own or control more 
television stations than any other single owner in the country. The network 
includes 17 full-power UHF stations and more than 75 low-power stations around 
the country, as well as at least 20 stations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The committee investigating Crouch held a secret, 14-hour committee meeting in 
Los Angeles in late September, during the western regional convention of the 
National Religious Broadcasters, according to one of those who attended the 
session but asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by the Rev. Keith A. Houser of Dallas. Houser has been 
battling Crouch for the past six years in the courts and before the Federal 
Communications Commission for control of WTBY-TV, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In his complaint to the National Religious Broadcasters, Houser repeated 
charges made in a lawsuit and before the FCC alleging that Crouch unethically 
took over the station, which Houser said he founded. Houser alleged that Crouch 
joined with other station board members, creditors and a banker and "cut deals 
with these parties without my prior knowledge and virtually started a hostile 
takeover of the television station." 
</P>
<P>
Houser also charged that the takeover was part of "the modus operandi of Paul 
Crouch in the taking of several other television stations" or building or 
buying new stations that undermined the audience of existing Christian 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Houser's lawsuit over control of the Poughkeepsie station is scheduled to go to 
trial soon, he said. There is no action pending before the FCC, which granted 
Trinity a license to the station without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Phillip A. Crouch, vice president of Trinity Broadcasting Network and 
brother of Paul Crouch, denied that the organization operated in any unethical 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly never wanted to hurt another organization," he said in a 
telephone interview. "If we are hurting one (Christian station), we are hurting 
ourselves. But we don't feel we are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said his brother, who was in Phoenix on Wednesday, is "a little upset at 
the NRB for not coming to him first." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that upsets him. We're kind of worrying about their ethics," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges made by Houser to the National Religious Broadcasters is 
that Phillip Little, a private detective employed by Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, was used to "intimidate" Trinity critics and former employees. In a 
telephone interview earlier this week, Little, who is chairman of West Coast 
Detectives Inc. of North Hollywood, acknowledged that he visited various people 
around the country on Trinity Broadcasting Network's s behalf but said that he 
never intimidated anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Any decision the National Religious Broadcasters' ethics committee reaches may 
be moot, said Paul Crouch's longtime Washington attorney, Colby M. May, who 
handles the network's dealings with the FCC. He said in a telephone interview 
that Crouch may quit the National Religious Broadcasters within the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
May said he has advised Crouch to quit the National Religious Broadcasters 
rather than comply with new requirements that by January, 1990, boards of 
directors must be controlled by individuals "other than those joined by a 
family relationship, staff or employees." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Crouch said his brother has not yet decided about remaining in the 
National Religious Broadcasters . 
</P>
<P>
National Religious Broadcasters members must submit applications by Feb. 15 to 
join the organization's new Ethics and Financial Integrity Commission. The 
watchdog group, which is not the same committee that is investigating Crouch, 
was established in the wake of the televangelism scandals of the past two 
years, and membership in the body is mandatory to remain in the National 
Religious Broadcasters organization. 
</P>
<P>
All of Trinity Broadcasting Network's 10 boards are headed by Paul Crouch and 
dominated by family members and employees.

LIGHTS! CAMERA! ACTION! SCHOOLS GO BEYOND 3 R'S

Student-produced television in the San Fernando Valley got its start 15 years 
ago when an El Camino Real High School teacher decided to perform a scene that 
could have come from "Mission: Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher John Heineman and a group of students broke into the Woodland Hills 
school after dark and rigged up a bootleg transmitter that could send 
television programming to every classroom via cable. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would give me permission if I had asked," said Heineman, who kept his 
job after the escapade because the principal at the time also saw the need to 
bring television into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Now TV production classes are among the most popular for Valley public high 
school students, who spend hours a day, often their own time, creating shows 
instead of watching them. And teachers have seized a medium blamed for spawning 
a generation of passive semiliterates and are turning out students who write, 
direct and produce their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
The student shows, a mix of fluff and hard news, teach more than just how to 
read a TelePrompTer, said Hall Davidson, Los Angeles Unified School District 
television adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools are using video to teach basic skills," Davidson said. "Students have 
to learn to write the words, as well as read the words, to be responsible, meet 
deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
This year, big-time TV discovered the popularity of student video classes. The 
prime-time CBS show "TV 101" -- part of which is filmed at Verdugo Hills High 
School -- chronicles the lives of high school students who work on a news team. 
</P>
<P>
But the actors cannot completely capture the obsession in their real-life 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them practically live here," said Lonny Scharf, Van Nuys High School 
television production teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The video classes, offered by at least three Valley high schools, are financed 
by district funds, state grants and private donations. Yet, district officials 
say, expensive television production facilities are usually built only when 
individual teachers, like Heineman, are willing to fight for them. 
</P>
<P>
At El Camino Real High School, students log hundreds of hours each semester to 
produce the school's weekly ECR News program shown in homeroom classes Tuesday 
mornings. "One minute of TV produced by kids takes 2 1/2 hours of work," 
Heineman said. 
</P>
<P>
At Verdugo Hills High School, students routinely spend hours outside class to 
film such scandals as one involving students who leave campus illegally to eat 
lunch at fast-food restaurants. Students this semester are producing segments 
of VHTV Student News that are planned for broadcast later this spring over King 
Cable's Channel 8 in the Sunland-Tujunga area. 
</P>
<P>
The Verdugo Hills campus reaches an even wider audience as the backdrop for the 
fictional Southern California high school used in "TV 101." Film crews 
routinely visit the campus to create parts of the show there. 
</P>
<P>
The creator of "TV 101," Karl Schaefer, said he did not know that Valley 
schools offered television production classes when he came up with the idea for 
the program. But he said he has heard plenty from the students since. 
</P>
<P>
They complain that the show is unrealistic. "They make it seem a lot easier 
than it really is," said Yvonne Farr, a senior and co-producer of El Camino 
Real's ECR News. "Their equipment is always working." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real's weekly news show is among only a handful of student news shows 
broadcast to each classroom in the school, district officials said. That 
arrangement was made possible because the 20-year-old Woodland Hills school, 
one of the newest in the district, was built to accommodate cable television in 
all its classrooms.

CARLSBAD WANTS SAMMIS TO DELIVER ON BATIQUITOS LAGOON PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad community support, once strong for plans to develop a graduate 
university and residential area atop the bluffs of scenic Batiquitos Lagoon, is 
waning fast as its developer struggles to get the troubled project under way. 
</P>
<P>
More than three years after the City Council unanimously approved the 
ambitious, 168-acre "Batiquitos Lagoon Educational Park," developer Don Sammis 
has made little progress toward creating what was supposed to be a 
self-contained community, anchored by an elite educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
Sammis won rave reviews from community leaders for the proposed educational 
park that was to house a law school, graduate schools, a training center for 
the U. S. Olympic volleyball squad, a hotel, restaurants and 600 residential 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Project 
</P>
<P>
The project along Batiquitos Lagoon -- the city's precious environmental 
resource that forms the southern border of Carlsbad -- concerned slow-growth 
advocates and environmentalists, but even they seemed attracted by the 
complex's unusual educational theme. 
</P>
<P>
When council members blessed Sammis' plans in October, 1985, they set a 
three-year deadline for the developer to lure an academic institution. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, as many schools declined Sammis' invitations and as other 
aspects of the project experienced difficulties, community members started 
grumbling about unkept promises. And, to the anger of slow-growth advocates, 
the only construction has been on 70 expensive, single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sammis failed to meet the deadline, the council must now decide whether 
to grant the developer an extension, tell him to redesign his project or tell 
him he can't go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Sammis maintains that he can still complete the project as first proposed and 
is asking for more time, according to Michael Holzmiller, city planning 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meetings I've had with Don Sammis, he has indicated that it has taken 
longer than he ever thought it would to get an educational entity," said 
Holzmiller, who said he spoke to the developer in early January. "He still 
believes he can do that, but he also told me that no one has signed up or 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want Him to Deliver' 
</P>
<P>
"He's talking to a number of different institutions," said Holzmiller, who did 
not know the names of the specific schools Sammis is pursuing. "Over the years, 
we've heard so many different names we don't care who he's recruiting. We just 
want him to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bruenig, a spokesman for the San Diego-based Sammis Properties, said: 
"We're presenting the status of the project to the Planning Department. We've 
been discussing with them on an ongoing basis." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the developer is making progress in recruiting an educational 
institution, Bruenig replied, "We're not ready to go public with that 
information." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the council members say they will not allow Sammis to proceed 
with the commercial elements of his original plans unless he can attract an 
academic institution. 
</P>
<P>
But, whether development of the total 600 planned residential units can 
actually be halted is now in question and may evolve into a legal dispute, 
Holzmiller said. Recently Sammis submitted plans to begin work on all the 
residential units provided to him under the original proposal, Holzmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is tentatively scheduled to review Sammis' project this 
month. And whether he will receive an extension will be decided by the council, 
most likely in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members are reluctant to say whether they will give Sammis 
more time, several have expressed their disappointment in what was first 
perceived as a "dream" project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'On the Hot Seat' 
</P>
<P>
"He's on the hot seat," Mayor Bud Lewis said of Sammis. "Either he's going to 
produce or go belly up. It was a beautiful dream, and so far that's all it has 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Kulchin had hopes that the project's graduate program would 
complement the undergraduate courses that will be offered when California State 
University's San Marcos campus opens in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially with San Marcos getting the new university, I thought Carlsbad 
would be an ideal place to have a graduate program," Kulchin said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Pettine added: "I do not recall a project that received so much 
community support as this one. But I can tell you that support is dwindling 
rapidly. Very rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
Pettine, along with Lewis and Kulchin, served on the five-member council that 
unanimously approved the project in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
With the benefit of hindsight, some critics say the council never should have 
given Sammis permission to build. But council members say the city was not 
irresponsible in approving the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Sammis was offering an innovative plan that was exciting to the city and its 
residents," Pettine said. "To the city's credit, if the developer failed to 
follow his plans, we gave ourselves the legal opportunity to review the 
project." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Setbacks 
</P>
<P>
But, about a year after his plans were approved, Sammis returned to the council 
to announce the first of several setbacks: He said he could not deliver a law 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Without securing the project's most important element, Sammis then asked the 
council to approve his plans to begin construction on 129 of the 600 
residential units: 70 single-family homes and 59 condominiums. Sammis said he 
needed to build the residential units to obtain revenue to finance the rest of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
To reassure council members, who became skeptical about the developer's intent 
to establish the educational theme, Sammis brought to a council meeting several 
representatives from educational institutions and letters from other officials 
stating their desire to come to the "educational park." 
</P>
<P>
"He brought these letters and paraded all these officials who said, 'Look, we 
want to come here,' " Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sammis presentation persuaded council members to exempt the developer from 
a Carlsbad building moratorium that had been approved as a stopgap while the 
city's growth-management plan was being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 single-family homes have already been built, but construction on the 
59 condominiums has not begun, Holzmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Sammis will be allowed to begin work on the 
remaining 471 residential units, said Holzmiller. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Questions 
</P>
<P>
"He acknowledges that he cannot go forward with any part of the educational 
complex, for example, or the restaurants or the offices that were to serve the 
educational institution," Holzmiller said. "But it's his belief that he can go 
ahead with the residential units. If the city pulls the rug out from underneath 
him, several legal questions may need to be answered." 
</P>
<P>
According to Holzmiller, Sammis argues that, as long as he complies with the 
city's growth-management plan, which demands that construction of public 
facilities keep pace with development, he should be allowed to complete the 
project's residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Kulchin, however, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that, after three years, if he failed to get an 
educational institution, the master plan is to be completely opened up," 
Kulchin said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the council decides on granting Sammis an extension, Kulchin said, "he's 
not getting anything else. He has to come back before the Planning Commission 
and the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lewis, however, acknowledges that Sammis is entitled to build the 
remaining residential units as long as he conforms with growth-management 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Council members aren't the only ones eager to take a hard look at the project. 
</P>
<P>
"He promised us Harvard West," said environmentalist Delores Welty, a Leucadia 
resident who lives across from the project site. 
</P>
<P>
"He promised us a volleyball team. . . . I'm sure people were hoping to see Tom 
Selleck running around in Carlsbad," she said. "Well, none of those things have 
been forthcoming."

PRIEST ARRESTED DURING ANTI-ABORTION PROTEST SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS' PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Edward (Bud) Kaicher, the first Catholic priest in San Diego County to 
be arrested during an anti-abortion protest, pleaded no contest Wednesday to a 
charge of criminal trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher was sentenced to two years' probation for his part in the Sept. 30 
demonstration and ordered to stay at least 10 feet away from the entrances of 
the Family Planning Associates Medical Group in La Mesa. But El Cajon Municipal 
Judge Larrie R. Brainard was careful to note that Kaicher was not prohibited 
from continuing to participate in anti-abortion demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen has the right to beat their own drum, to carry their sign," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David Rubin after Wednesday's hearing. "We're just saying do 
it in a legal fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys on the case were halfway through picking a jury for Kaicher's 
criminal trial when the priest decided to change his plea. The change of heart 
came about when he and lawyer Timothy Treadwell, a deacon in the Catholic 
Church, realized they would not be able to make the trial a forum for their 
anti-abortion views. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trial, Judge Brainard told the lawyers that criminal trespassing was 
the issue -- the only issue -- that would be addressed during the trial. Even 
so, the judge quizzed potential jurors on their views on abortion, and several 
asked to be excused, saying they could not overlook their strong feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my desire and intent to use the trial as an opportunity to try the 
issue of abortion," Kaicher said after his sentencing Wednesday. "But, when the 
judge determined that the parameters within which the defense could operate 
would be strictly limited to the issue of trespassing, that made it 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
"We were really there to discuss trespass. . . . If that was what they wanted 
to do, the law didn't really allow for that," said prosecutor Rubin. "Father 
Kaicher's beliefs, as a matter of law, really aren't relevant to that, although 
I know they are important to him." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he felt the judge's sentence was fair. "He's not being prevented 
from expressing his views. We're just interested in keeping the peace." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion demonstrators have frequently targeted the Family Planning 
Associates clinic on Fletcher Parkway. The assemblies are usually peaceful, 
according to prosecutor Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration on Sept. 30 was not much different. A group of about 25 
churchgoers from Catholic parishes in Santee and Lakeside gathered in the 
parking lot of the clinic and knelt to pray. Kaicher took his demonstration a 
few steps farther, right up to the double doors of the clinic, where patients 
were entering for abortions and other medical services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held 'Choose Life' Sign 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher said he sat quietly with his back to the doors, holding a sign that 
read "Choose Life." The priest said he did not obstruct the door, and that a 
number of people did in fact pass him to enter the building. "My motivation was 
to be a sign to them that there's another option," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But clinic officials took a dim view of the priest's activities, and he was 
arrested by a security guard and turned over to La Mesa police. 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher, the 34-year-old director of the San Diego diocese's Youth Ministries 
program, is a seasoned protester. While an assistant pastor in Calexico, he 
demonstrated a number of times at the federal immigration detention facility in 
El Centro. Kaicher said he was protesting the way in which the government was 
handling Central American refugees and the way the refugees were treated inside 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
But, Kaicher said, he has never been arrested before. In fact, the La Mesa 
incident was Kaicher's first anti-abortion protest. 
</P>
<P>
'Still Have an Uphill Battle' 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, the bishop of the San Diego Diocese sent a letter to all priests 
outlining the status of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing 
abortion. In the letter, Bishop Leo T. Maher wrote that, although the Supreme 
Court may agree to rehear Roe vs. Wade soon, "we will still have an uphill 
battle in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The letter reiterated the Catholic Church's strong anti-abortion stance and 
concluded with a call for action: "Let us continue to pray for the conversion 
of hearts, work for the repeal of anti-life legislation and support the efforts 
of pro-life groups." 
</P>
<P>
Although defense attorney Treadwell said the letter could be construed as 
official encouragement to priests to get involved in anti-abortion issues, 
Kaicher said: "I don't think it would be fair to say that he in any way was 
encouraging us to become any more actively involved in protests." 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher said he was acting out of his own personal commitment and said he 
didn't set out to be arrested. "But, quite frankly, I was willing to risk that 
to make the statement." 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher said he will continue to participate in local anti-abortion 
demonstrations, while abiding by the terms of his probation. "The judge has 
said that I have every right to exercise my First Amendment right of freedom of 
speech and the freedom to protest," he said. "I will continue to be involved in 
speaking on behalf of the unborn at every opportunity I have." 
</P>
<P>
Declined to Discuss Case 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Family Planning Associates in La Mesa repeatedly declined to 
discuss the case, citing a strict "no comment" policy at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Lenore Lowe said Family Planning Associates 
clinic has always tried to remain out of the public eye, especially in abortion 
debates. Planned Parenthood and Womancare, another local clinic, have 
historically been more active in fighting anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strong advocacy program for reproductive health care, which 
includes a platform on abortion rights," Lowe said. Anti-abortion protesting 
has been common in San Diego for quite a few years, and Womancare has been the 
recent target of a variety of harassment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
1984 Firebombing 
</P>
<P>
Most notable in the history of anti-abortion activity in the county was the 
1984 firebombing of the now-closed Birth Control Institute on El Cajon 
Boulevard. Last year, the Rev. Dorman Owens of the Bible Missionary Fellowship 
Church in Santee and several of his associates were convicted of crimes linked 
to an attempted bombing of the Alvarado Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
With those exceptions, anti-abortion activity in the county has been peaceful 
and somewhat sporadic, Lowe said.

STING NETS 4 ACCUSED OF PROVIDING PHONY DOCUMENTS TO ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Federal immigration investigators arrested four people Wednesday who were 
allegedly involved in two separate schemes to provide false documentation to 
unqualified applicants for the farm-worker amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
Silvia Serrano and Silvina Gil were arrested in connection with a scheme they 
were reportedly operating through their business, Notary Public S &amp; S on 
Border Village Road. Mario Olvera and Ana Maria Gonzalez Reyes of Olvera 
Bookkeeping Income Tax Notary on San Ysidro Boulevard were also arrested, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials announced. Both businesses are 
in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The operation involved INS agents posing as undocumented workers who wished to 
qualify for amnesty, officials said. During the investigation, agents were 
offered false employment affidavits and check stubs to use as proof of farm 
labor employment during their legalization interviews, according to INS 
spokesman Arnoldo Flores. At both businesses, the agents were provided document 
packages and crash courses in farm techniques, for prices ranging from $650 to 
$1,500, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olvera operation appears to have offered the higher level of personal 
service," Flores said, adding that, in one instance, the undercover officer, 
after paying his money, was outfitted with false documents, driven to a 
doctor's office for a prearranged medical exam, then delivered to the door of 
the INS legalization center to file his fake application. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the Special Agricultural Worker section of the amnesty program, 
applicants must be able to prove they worked at least 90 days in agriculture 
during a one-year period after May 1, 1985. Many undocumented workers have no 
documents to prove their residence in the United States, and, as a result, a 
huge industry has sprung up along the border in the past few years to assist 
farm workers seeking amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
In October, INS authorities announced a plan to crack down on "massive fraud" 
in amnesty applications in San Diego County. At that time, it was believed that 
about 65% of farm-worker amnesty applicants had submitted fraudulent documents.

LATINO ADVOCACY GROUP CONDEMNS BORDER DITCH, FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Latino advocacy group chose a highly symbolic spot -- the pedestrian entrance 
to Mexico in San Ysidro -- to add its voice to the chorus of opposition to two 
recent border proposals: the construction of a ditch along the border in San 
Diego County and the imposition of a fee for visitors entering the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is outrageous," said Jose Castillo, South Bay representative for the 
Mexican American Political Assn., a statewide group. "Next thing you know, 
they'll want to put up a moat with alligators. . . . We don't need another 
Berlin Wall." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo and other group leaders spoke during a news conference at the San 
Ysidro port of entry, just a few feet north of the metal revolving doors that 
lead pedestrians from the United States to Mexico. It is also the spot where, 
each day, U. S. immigration authorities return hundreds of Mexican citizens to 
Tijuana after arresting them as illegal aliens in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Among Critics 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 4 1/2-mile ditch, which would be built in the relatively flat Otay 
Mesa area, is designed to cut off a specific portion of that undocumented flow 
-- those who arrive aboard the up to 450 vehicles that U. S. authorities say 
cross the border illegally each month. The ditch, which authorities say could 
be in place by the end of the year, is also designed to cut down on drugs 
smuggled by vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino group is the latest in a series of critics to ridicule the ditch and 
entrance-fee plans, which have generated controversy on both sides of the 
border. Although the ditch idea has drawn the most criticism, a proposal to 
impose fees on visitors from south of the border is being eyed warily in San 
Ysidro, a community long dependent on shoppers from Mexico. Merchants fear that 
such a tariff would drastically reduce expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"It would really hurt us," said Bertalicia Gonzalez, a San Ysidro businesswoman 
who appeared at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals for entry fees -- $2 for cars -- have emerged in Washington. U. 
S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said he plans to introduce legislation 
proposing the creation of a somewhat smaller fee, which would be used in part 
to enhance border security and reduce waiting time at ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
A private, Washington-based study group, the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, has also unveiled proposals for an entry fee. The group has 
also proposed a series of more extensive barriers along the border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denounced as Extremist 
</P>
<P>
Many critics, including those who gathered in San Ysidro, have denounced the 
FAIR group as extremist, far right-wing and anti-immigrant. Nonetheless, the 
group, which denies charges of racism, is said to be close to policy-makers 
within the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino leaders who spoke Wednesday suggested that it is shortsighted to 
assume that a wide-ranging socioeconomic problem such as illegal immigration 
can be solved with barriers and entry fees. Rather, they suggested that U. S. 
officials put more emphasis on assisting Mexico's economy, a strategy they 
contend would eventually eliminate the need for Mexicans to cross the border in 
search of livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
"A ditch is not going to solve anything," said Tomas Sanchez, a student 
representative for the Mexican American Political Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As for drug smuggling, the Latino leaders, like officials of Mexico and other 
Latin American nations, pointed their fingers north: The drug traffic would 
lessen immediately, they said, if the U. S. demand for such products 
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
As the representatives spoke into the microphones and the news cameras rolled, 
dozens of curious Mexican citizens passed by on their way to the revolving 
doors that lead to Tijuana, often stopping to listen to the denunciations. 
</P>
<P>
"A ditch is not going to stop people from crossing the border," said a 
22-year-old Tijuana resident who gave his name as Jesus. "People looking for a 
better future will always find a way to cross."

A fourth man convicted of raping a woman in Balboa Park last summer was 
sentenced to seven years in state prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three other men had received the same sentence as Michael DeLeon, 20. All four 
were undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The rape of the 22-year-old Santee woman occurred at 6:30 a.m. Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Robert Stahl also imposed a $100 fine on DeLeon, as 
he did on the three others. They are Gabriel Gutierrez, 22; Jose DeJesus 
Hernandez Leyva, 24, and Manuel Ponce Renteria, 20. Three others accused in the 
case are juveniles and have been prosecuted in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
The adults pleaded guilty to performing a rape in concert.

<P>
A San Diego woman, hospitalized Sunday afternoon with a head wound after 
allegedly being shot by her son-in-law, died early Wednesday morning, a deputy 
coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Erbe, 58, died at Sharp Memorial Hospital at 1:30 a.m. A bullet had 
lodged in her brain and she had not been expected to survive, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested in connection with the shooting was Randy Ernest Geering, 36, who 
reportedly quarreled with his mother-in-law and his estranged wife after 
confronting them in the women's restroom of a doughnut shop in the 5000 block 
of Balboa Avenue in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Geering fled to his wife's apartment in the 5500 block of 
Balboa Arms Drive, where he called a television station, reportedly to confess 
the shooting. The station called police, who arrested Geering. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office plans to change a charge of attempted murder to 
murder during Geering's bail review on Friday, said Gregg McClain, a deputy 
district attorney. Geering is being held in County Jail in lieu of $200,000 
bail.

LE SEX SHOPPE IN STUDIO CITY TOLD TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studio City's controversial Le Sex Shoppe was ordered closed by the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday under a law prohibiting adult businesses within 500 
feet of homes. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Sarno, an attorney for the shop, vowed to go to court to try to 
block the council action on the grounds that it violates the company's 
constitutional right to freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
City zoning officials have given the adult bookstore and video arcade at 12323 
Ventura Blvd. until Feb. 13 to close or face misdemeanor prosecution. The 
ordinance carries a penalty of six months in jail and $500 for each day an 
adult business remains open in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Denied Unanimously 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the council unanimously and without discussion denied an appeal by 
the shop's owner, EWAP Inc., for an extension to stay in business until 1991. 
EWAP is an acronym for Erotic Words and Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 city ordinance, which was inspired by Studio City residents' battle to 
rid their community of Le Sex Shoppe, gave sexually oriented establishments 
until the middle of 1988 to move if they are within 500 feet of residences. 
Businesses with long-term leases or large investments in their sites were 
permitted to apply to the council for three-year extensions. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Flamingo Massage in Sherman Oaks was the first of 58 appeals 
to reach the council. It was denied an extension. Its attorney vowed to 
challenge the decision. Twelve adult businesses have gone out of business since 
the law took effect, zoning officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City residents have battled for years to close Le Sex Shoppe, saying it 
breeds crime. Police have made 24 lewd conduct arrests at the business since 
February, 1986, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Le Sex Shoppe has been a big nuisance in the community for a long time," 
Councilman Mike Woo said Wednesday. The business is in Woo's district. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased," said Polly Ward, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Le Sex Shoppe chain has agreed to take steps to reduce criminal activity, 
including increasing lighting, hiring uniformed security guards and installing 
closed-circuit television systems to allow shop employees to monitor all areas 
of the businesses, Sarno said. The action came in response to a nuisance 
abatement lawsuit filed Monday by the city attorney against Le Sex Shoppes in 
Canoga Park, North Hollywood and Studio City.

BUS FIRM TO LOSE CONTRACT WITH SCHOOLS IN NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newhall School District has decided not to renew its $300,000 annual 
contract with Laidlaw Transit when it expires in June, saying the company has 
provided poor bus service. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw's poor record, as well as a desire to cut costs, has motivated the 
district to seek bids from other contractors, Pat Willett, a school district 
trustee, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laidlaw buses serving the William S. Hart Union High School District 
continue to have scheduling problems, a school district official said. 
</P>
<P>
"They really haven't shown any improvement," said Jim Bown, director of support 
services in the Hart district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buses Often Late 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hart and Newhall districts, both in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
have complained for months that a chronic shortage of drivers results in sloppy 
bus service. Buses are habitually late and many drivers are unfamiliar with 
routes, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw, the largest school bus transportation company in the nation, has 
pledged repeatedly to improve service. The company is paid about $1 million a 
year to transport 3,600 Hart and Newhall students. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Supt. J. Michael McGrath notified Laidlaw on Jan. 23 that the district 
plans to seek transportation bids for the new fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
McGrath did not cite poor service in his letter, but the message was clear, he 
said Wednesday. The letter's tone, he said, "was rather cold." 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Contract Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw is free to bid on Newhall's contract once again, but the district has 
little confidence in the company, McGrath said. "They almost seem incapable of 
dealing with it," he said of the tardy buses. "The real issue is that they have 
a constant shortage of drivers." 
</P>
<P>
The company has tried to fill its driving ranks in the valley by housing 
substitute Laidlaw drivers in area motels. The company also has tried to 
recruit valley residents to drive its buses. The firm has run classified 
advertisements in community newspapers and stationed recruiters outside 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
But Willett said bad publicity probably has hampered Laidlaw's efforts. Bown 
said Laidlaw is short of drivers in some of the company's other Southern 
California operations and is hard-pressed to find substitutes to drive in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they've got anyone to bring up here," Bown said. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw's performance in the valley improved in November and December after 
Hart officials threatened to sever their contract unless buses started running 
on time. But bus service nose-dived when students returned from their winter 
break last month, Bown said. 
</P>
<P>
An independent auditor is reviewing transportation services in the Hart and 
Newhall districts. The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about Laidlaw's service in the valley mirror criticisms leveled 
against the company in the Las Virgenes Unified School District during the 
1987-88 school year. Laidlaw buses were late and the firm had to rely on a 
staff of substitute drivers, said Fred Wendt, the Las Virgenes district's 
supervisor of maintenance operations and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Las Virgenes district decided not to renew its contract with Laidlaw partly 
because of poor service, Wendt said. The district also sought a less costly 
transportation firm, he said. Laidlaw bid to regain the contract but lost to 
another firm, he said.

NEIGHBORHOOD INVITED TO DINNER, PEP TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is the way to a neighborhood's heart through its stomach? 
</P>
<P>
A Woodland Hills developer hungering for support for his planned $150-million 
office project at the edge of Warner Center hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
Builder Jack Spound invited a whole neighborhood to a fancy hotel dinner 
Tuesday night to ensure backing for his controversial project at a crucial Los 
Angeles Planning Commission hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
And Spound has asked all 850 members of the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce 
to stop by the hotel tonight for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres and to talk about 
supporting him at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said the Tuesday night dinner was a reward for residents of the Warner 
Hills condominium development who have backed his project, which he hopes to 
build in partnership with the Johnson Wax Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But foes of the proposed development criticized his hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the condominium development next to the site where Spound wants to 
build his "Warner Ridge" high-rise project were treated to cocktails and veal 
with wild mushroom sauce and filet of salmon on the side in the grand ballroom 
of the Warner Center Marriott hotel. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 residents were expected; 34 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
After dessert, guests heard a pep talk about how crucial the neighborhood's 
support will be when the Planning Commission conducts the 5 p.m. public hearing 
for Spound's application at Parkman Junior High School, 20800 Burbank Blvd., 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Other homeowners in the area oppose the project. Their objections have prompted 
City Councilwoman Joy Picus to try to rezone the site so that only 
single-family houses can be built there. 
</P>
<P>
Spound contends that his proposed nine-structure development, which would 
include two seven-story buildings, is endorsed by the majority of homeowners 
who live near his 22-acre site at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and 
Oxnard Street. 
</P>
<P>
Spound's hospitality drew a hostile reaction from project opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider it ethical," said Robert Gross, a vice president of the 
Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, whose neighborhood was not invited to 
the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"The wining and dining of selected local residents shows this developer will 
stop at nothing to achieve his goal," Gross said. "I have a real problem with 
him trying to pit neighbor against neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
But Spound said outside the hotel ballroom Tuesday night: "This is just a way 
of thanking people who have supported us all along." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, his public relations consultant said the dinner was held to build 
"team spirit and camaraderie" among supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney Wilson Knott said the dinner was aimed at boosting the self-confidence 
of supporters. She said some of them emerged from a previous public hearing 
with a bitter taste in their mouths after they were hooted down by project 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
Gross denied that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was very polite to the proponents of the project," Gross said. "If 
they felt intimidated, I guess they had a guilty conscience. If I decided I 
wanted to support an unpopular thing in the community, I'd feel as intimidated 
as hell. It's a natural reaction."

TONY HOPE RETURNS TO CALIFORNIA POLITICAL SCENE -- IF NOT CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Hope, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1986 and is entertainer Bob 
Hope's son, has gained a nomination to the state Republican Central Committee 
-- possibly with an eye toward a future congressional bid. 
</P>
<P>
But while the action signals Hope's return to the California political scene, 
it does not necessarily reflect a return to California. He apparently resides 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) said Tuesday that she recommended 
Hope, whom she has known for many years, for the party post last month. He is 
expected to be confirmed to a two-year term when the state GOP gathers Feb. 18 
for its next convention. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me and told me he was now working in the district and he'd like to 
be active in the party," Wright said. "I was looking for someone to appoint." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,380 to 1,400 members of the Central Committee elect party officers, 
including the state chairman, and can amend party rules. In addition, the 
courts last year ruled that state parties have the power to endorse candidates 
in primaries; the Republicans chose not to do so in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, 48, an attorney, works for Mutual of Omaha and resides in Washington, two 
Republican officials said. He moved to Northridge temporarily in 1986 when he 
ran for the GOP nomination to a 21st District seat vacated by Bobbi Fiedler. 
Hope was upset in the Republican primary by then-Simi Valley Mayor Elton 
Gallegly, who won the general election and was reelected last November. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly seized on Hope's absence from California for 10 years, characterizing 
him as a carpetbagger who was trading on his father's name and fund-raising 
ability. He was aided by the disclosure that Hope had not registered to vote 
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Hope's absence from the state is not likely to matter. 
There is no residency requirement in the Republican Party bylaws for 
appointment to the state committee. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be a registered Republican," state Republican Party spokesman 
John Kurzweil said of prospective members. "I think that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Hope could not be reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He does not have a California driver's license, according to state Department 
of Motor Vehicles records, and is not registered to vote in either Ventura or 
Los Angeles counties, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's office was unable to provide an address or phone number for Hope on 
Tuesday. Kurzweil said his impression was that Hope lives and works in 
Washington. Another prominent Republican said that Hope lives in Washington and 
travels to Southern California frequently for Mutual of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Hope's government credentials include service on two presidential commissions. 
Former President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Grace Commission, which was 
mandated to pinpoint waste and fraud in the federal government. Ex-President 
Gerald Ford named him vice president of the Overseas Investment Corp. Hope is a 
graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Appointment 
</P>
<P>
In nominating Hope, Wright used an additional appointment she was awarded 
because the percentage of the vote she received last November exceeded the 
percentage of the Republican registration in her district. She had a total of 
nine appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said Hope's appointment could be a precursor to a second congressional 
bid if another district is created in Ventura County when the state Legislature 
and governor redraw district boundaries after the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he hadn't gotten it out of his system," Gallegly said. "He might run 
again" if a new seat is established. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he has made amends with his former opponent, who attended one of 
the congressman's fund-raisers and visited him in his Washington office after 
his election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a contribution to make," said Gallegly, who also has nine 
appointees to the GOP Central Committee. "I wish he would have called me. I 
might have made the recommendation instead of Cathie."

TRUCK CAREENS OFF FREEWAY, HITS 2 HOUSES 
</P>

<P>
North Hollywood residents renewed their pleas Wednesday for a sound barrier 
along the Hollywood Freeway after a tractor-trailer truck carrying hazardous 
waste careened off the road and plowed into two houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fighting this thing for years, trying to get a barrier," said Diana 
Cobb, who lives next to one of the damaged houses. "Now maybe they'll listen." 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the accident, which occurred north of Saticoy Street shortly 
after 10 p.m. Tuesday. California Highway Patrol investigators said they 
believe the driver of the 18-wheel flatbed truck loaded with containers of used 
asbestos insulation drifted onto the freeway shoulder, hit a parked car and 
crashed down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
The driver fled after asking the startled resident of one of the damaged houses 
on Babcock Avenue to call 911 for help, CHP Officer Randy Klucker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compton Firm's Truck 
</P>
<P>
The truck is registered to J. Cal Transportation of Compton, Klucker said. But 
investigators could not immediately determine who was driving the truck, he 
said, adding that their inquiry is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was removed from the back yards of the two houses Wednesday morning 
after the Los Angeles County Health Department determined that none of the 
sealed asbestos containers had opened in the accident, Klucker said. 
</P>
<P>
After years of complaining to various agencies without results, the North 
Hollywood Residents Assn. formed a coalition last July to push for freeway 
sound walls in its community. Their plan included the Hollywood Freeway section 
that was the scene of Tuesday night's accident, said Bob Brice, a Babcock 
Avenue resident and association member. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always known this could happen, but we certainly hoped it wouldn't 
happen," Brice said. "We didn't want to wait for a tragedy before we did 
something." 
</P>
<P>
William Minter, a state Department of Transportation engineer, said a block or 
poured concrete sound wall probably would not have prevented the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit so hard, had there been a wall there, there would have been a wall and 
a truck in those houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guardrail Study 
</P>
<P>
Minter said Caltrans will study whether a guardrail would help the area where 
the truck left the freeway. But he said Caltrans' research has shown that 
guardrails sometimes make accident situations worse. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they would welcome a guardrail, but they still believe a sound 
wall would have slowed the truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We need both of them," Brice said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck flew through Sam Yacharn's back yard, leaving holes in the back of 
his house and skid marks on his chimney, then landed in Rolando Manasala's 
kitchen. It could not be immediately determined how much it will cost to repair 
the two stucco houses in the 7800 block of Babcock Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a big boom, you know," said Manasala, who was watching television when 
the crash occurred. "I told my wife, 'It's a big earthquake coming down.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swing Set in Kitchen 
</P>
<P>
When Manasala entered his kitchen, he saw rubble and glass and twisted metal, 
which turned out to be Yacharn's back-yard swing set. But he didn't see the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I heard a voice that said, 'Anybody home? I need help,' " he said. "It 
was the truck driver." 
</P>
<P>
Manasala could not get a dial tone on his telephone, so he left to use a 
neighbor's phone. When he returned home a few minutes later, he said, the truck 
driver was gone. 
</P>
<P>
The houses on Babcock Avenue were built a decade after the freeway opened in 
1968. Proposals for sound walls in that area became mired in a power struggle 
between Caltrans and the Los Angeles City Planning Department, Brice said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans' Minter said the city is at fault for allowing a developer to build 
next to the freeway without requiring sound barriers. But Rick Kunz, field 
deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs, said no precedent exists for the city to get 
involved with freeway sound-wall decisions.

RESIDENTS MAY PAY FOR SOUND WALL; 
</P>
<P>
TOLUCA LAKE PROPERTY OWNERS TO VOTE ON FREEWAY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To determine whether residents want a sound wall enough to pay for it, letter 
ballots will be mailed next week to the 225 Toluca Lake property owners who 
would be assessed from $4,000 to $24,000 each for the Ventura Freeway project, 
Los Angeles city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first resident-financed sound wall in California, state 
Department of Transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
If residents do not elect to assess themselves, Caltrans eventually will build 
a sound wall along the north side of the freeway between Clybourn Street and 
Cahuenga Boulevard, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if they vote to go ahead with self-financing, which the 
property owners would pay over 15 years, Caltrans eventually will reimburse 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has compiled a list of 220 neighborhoods in the state that meet 
minimum requirements for sound walls. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhoods are ranked according to the severity of the traffic noise, 
the cost of building a particular wall, the projected noise decrease and the 
number of homes affected. 
</P>
<P>
At the present pace of construction, the 3/4-mile-long Toluca Lake wall would 
be built in 15 to 20 years, said Caltrans engineer William Minter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reimbursement Required 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that Caltrans reimburse any city or group of residents that 
builds a wall once the project reaches the top of the state priority list. 
</P>
<P>
A mail poll last month of the Toluca Lake residents indicated 56% of those 
responding supported creation of a benefit-assessment district to build the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
But only three-fourths of the property owners returned ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Presby, field deputy for City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the 
affected neighborhood, said that "because it's been talked about so much in the 
last few weeks, we hope to get as high as a 90% response this time." 
</P>
<P>
She said that before ordering the city Public Works Department to proceed with 
detailed cost estimates, Ferraro "wants evidence that a majority really wants 
it." 
</P>
<P>
She said that while opponents were vocal at a community meeting Tuesday night, 
there was no way to determine whether sentiment had shifted since the earlier 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Farias of the Public Works Department said that once the wall's design is 
refined, "the cost will drop at least 20% and maybe even 30%" from the city's 
initial estimate of $2.1 million. That estimate, which was used to project 
individual assessments, was deliberately high to cover a worst-case situation. 
</P>
<P>
Farias said the ballots, which will go out next week, will have a return 
deadline of Feb. 28.

WOMAN GETS 16 MONTHS IN DEATH OF CYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster woman was sentenced to 16 months in prison Wednesday in the death 
of a motorcyclist whom she hit while driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Lynn Carey, 25, pleaded guilty in Van Nuys Superior Court in November in 
the August 28, 1987, accident that resulted in the death of John Hamaker, 35, 
of Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
Carey was driving east on Parthenia Street at Balboa Boulevard at 8:50 p.m. 
when she ran a red light and struck Hamaker's motorcycle, authorities said. 
Hamaker, who was not wearing a helmet, died instantly of head and chest 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers in Carey's car, her 8-month-old son and a 23-year-old man, were 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Carey was given a breath test at the scene that showed a blood-alcohol level of 
0.19%, almost twice the state's legal limit for intoxication of 0.10%, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, who had worked as a waitress, told authorities that she had had "a 
couple of beers" earlier in the day while at the zoo with her son, according to 
the probation report. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Carey had been arrested for driving under the 
influence of alcohol in 1981 and had been attending an alcohol-treatment 
program since the 1987 accident. She will be eligible for parole in about 8 
months, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca S. Dewees.

WHITE'S STAR RISING IN BID FOR HEAD COACH 
</P>

The candidacy of Mike White continued to gain momentum and currency around the 
NFL Wednesday when one prominent player-agent said White has the inside track 
for the vacant Charger head coaching position and one NFL general manager said 
he couldn't figure out why the Chargers were delaying the announcement on 
White. 
</P>
<P>
It also has been learned that New Orleans Coach Jim Mora and former San 
Francisco Coach Bill Walsh strongly endorsed White to top Charger management 
within the past week. The Chargers have been looking to replace the fired Al 
Saunders since Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear it's going to be White," agent Leigh Steinberg said. "And I think he'd 
be a fabulous head coach. The guy is amazing. And he can make guys play over 
their heads, which is especially important for a team that doesn't have the 
highest talent level." 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to guess, I'd say the job is Mike's," said the general manager, who 
wished to remain anonymous. "Frankly, I'm surprised it has taken this long. It 
looks like Mike fits." 
</P>
<P>
All the Chargers will say is that White, who had winning records as a head 
coach at Illinois and California, is one of the finalists for the job along 
with Redskin assistant Dan Henning and Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. 
The Chargers also say they are still considering Bears' running backs coach 
Johnny Roland and two of their own assistants -- Wayne Sevier and Jerry Rhome. 
Rhome is the Chargers' offensive coordinator. Sevier runs the special teams. 
</P>
<P>
But last week Mora spoke at length about White by phone to Steve Ortmayer, the 
Chargers' director of football operations. In that conversation Mora 
recommended White highly. Ortmayer is an admirer of Mora and employs his son, 
Jim Mora Jr., as a defensive staff assistant. The Mora endorsement is seen as a 
major plus on White's resume. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week at a social gathering in Monterey, Walsh reportedly approached 
Charger owner Alex Spanos and told him why White was the best man for the job. 
White was present at the time. Spanos was playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am 
golf tournament, as was 49ers' owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. Walsh was there to 
meet with DeBartolo about the decision DeBartolo eventually reached to name 
George Seifert as Walsh's replacement. At one time Seifert was a candidate for 
the Charger job. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer was unavailable for comment Wednesday. He begins evaluating college 
talent today at the annual scouting combine workouts in Indianapolis. Spanos, 
who was ill with the flu Tuesday, has repeatedly referred inquiries concerning 
the job search to Ortmayer. The Chargers are not expected to announce their new 
head coach until the beginning of next week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
White like Walsh, has made his reputation as an innovative offensive mind. He 
resigned his position at Illinois last January after being linked with a 
recruiting scandal involving Hart Lee Dykes, a wide receiver who later enrolled 
at Oklahoma State. Since then White has been working for Pro Scout 
Incorporated, a pro personnel service for NFL teams. He lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg has represented several quarterbacks who have played for White, 
including New England's Tony Eason and former Falcon Steve Bartkowski. White 
also helped develop NFL quarterbacks Jim Plunkett, Mike Boryla, Dave Wilson and 
Jack Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the delay on naming White could stem from White's association 
with Saunders. Saunders was White's assistant at Cal in the '70s. Saunders 
became persona non grata within the Charger organization after he gained the 
reputation for playing inside politics. White also is a political animal. But 
his coaching skills and enthusiasm are unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
White already has told the Chargers he would retain Lynn as his defensive 
coordinator, a prerequisite for the job. But he would probably get permission 
from the Chargers to bring in his own offensive staff. 
</P>
<P>
And, Steinberg said, "he's the kind of guy who could attract the hot comers as 
assistants -- guys who would be future head coaching candidates in their own 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg has dealt with Spanos in negotiations with Chargers players such as 
Jim Lachey (now a Redskin) and James FitzPatrick. And he says he thinks White 
and Spanos could get along. "As volatile as Spanos is, my feeling is he would 
slack off a little if he had total confidence in his coach," Steinberg said. 
"And I think he would have that confidence in Mike White." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said the Chargers won't go wrong if they hire Lynn either. "I'd be 
excited about that. But maybe he's not quite ready. One day he (Lynn) will be a 
head coach."

DMV FILES NEW FRAUD CHARGE AGAINST CLOSED CAR DEALER IN COMPTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Motor Vehicles has filed new charges against the Brett 
Mitchell Chevrolet dealership in the Compton Auto Plaza, alleging that the firm 
defrauded a finance company. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitchell dealership closed in December after the DMV suspended its 
operating license for alleged sales and tax irregularities. In January, the 
state canceled the license, claiming that for two years Mitchell did not file 
corporate information required by the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has been trying to regain his license. Last week he filed the 
corporate information and also paid about $4,400 in late registration fees and 
fines for new cars he sold, DMV officials confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
But the DMV is prepared to argue that Mitchell should not be allowed to resume 
operations because of the new charges. A hearing is scheduled Feb. 14 and 15 in 
an administrative law court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The department is alleging, among other things, that Mitchell received money 
from a Long Beach finance company for new-car titles, but failed to transfer 
the titles to the company, Fidelity Financial. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the DMV alleged, the finance company attempted to repossess a car, 
only to discover that the dealership already had repossessed the car because 
the buyer's down-payment check had been returned because of insufficient funds. 
In another case, according to the DMV, the finance company attempted to 
repossess a car, but found that the sales contract had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV also said the Mitchell dealership had violated state law by continuing 
to sell cars after the dealership's retail sales permit had been revoked by the 
State Board of Equalization. The state office, which collects sales taxes, 
revoked the permit in November because the company owed more than $100,000 in 
state sales taxes for cars it sold, the DMV said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Five-Year Lease 
</P>
<P>
Compton was counting on Mitchell and other automobile dealers in the mall 
alongside the Artesia Freeway to provide jobs, sales tax revenue, and in 
Mitchell's case, rent money for the buildings he was using under the terms of a 
five-year lease with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, according to a city report on the dealership's finances, Mitchell owes 
the city $115,887 on the $175,000 loan it gave him in 1987 to expand the 
dealership, and $12,000 in back rent payments. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the closure, only three dealerships remain in the auto mall. 
When the city opened the mall more than a decade ago, officials hoped to have 
as many as 14 dealerships. But some of the redevelopment land now has been 
earmarked for other uses, such as a hotel and convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell could not be reached for comment.

POLICE TO ADD SUBSTATION, MORE PATROLS IN PALISADES

In response to a series of tragedies involving Pacific Palisades youths during 
the last two years, community leaders have persuaded Los Angeles police to open 
a substation this month and to add an extra patrol in the affluent area. 
</P>
<P>
After meetings with police officials from the West Los Angeles Division, the 
Palisades Chamber of Commerce agreed to donate its office space for the 
substation, which will allow officers to file criminal reports in the area 
rather than returning to headquarters several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 19 months, 10 young residents of the community, including seven 
students at Palisades High School, have suffered violent deaths, most involving 
alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attractive to Criminals 
</P>
<P>
Palisades business leaders fear that publicity surrounding the deaths could 
make the community more attractive to criminals, and residents have been 
grappling recently with ways to increase police enforcement in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie Wishnick, Chamber of Commerce president, said residents will continue to 
meet with police to see if they can find a way to staff the substation full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the substation, which will be open for use 24 hours, will only 
be used by officers who want to cut down on their travel time to division 
headquarters by filing their reports in the chamber office. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have balked at a full-time substation, saying it would be 
beneficial to have more officers patrolling the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, it will keep them in the Palisades that much longer," said 
Ann Pritchard, executive director of the chamber. "A lot of people have been 
expressing concern about our vulnerability. This should help." 
</P>
<P>
Police emphasized that Palisades residents should continue to report crimes to 
West Los Angeles Division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the opening has been delayed two weeks because the chamber's 
landlord has asked for an insurance liability release for the substation. She 
said she expects it to open in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the substation and the added patrol, the foot patrol officer now 
assigned to the Palisades will no longer be reassigned to other areas in West 
Los Angeles when the need arises, according to police officials. The Palisades 
patrol area extends from Mandeville Canyon to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The community's concern about crime in the area peaked late last October after 
four youths were killed in a fiery crash when their auto veered out of control 
and struck a light pole on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica. Three of the 
youths were students at Palisades High School. Toxicology reports showed that 
three of them, including the driver, had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
The incident followed the highly publicized murder of an 18-year-old Palisades 
High senior. Teak Dyer was found beaten and shot to death in a Pacific 
Palisades office building, not far from the Chamber of Commerce, in late June. 
</P>
<P>
"The community wanted police protection to be a higher priority," Wishnick 
said. "The more police visibility we have, the better off we'll be."

PARK LABREA WILL FENCE 156-ACRE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The management of Park Labrea has announced plans to fence in the 156-acre 
community of apartment towers and townhouses for the first time since it was 
opened in the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"It will in general restrict vehicular traffic and parking, thus preserving 
parking and access for the residents and guests," said Joan Kraden, a 
spokeswoman for Forest City Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Kraden said Tuesday that Forest City, which owns much of the complex, is 
working out the details of the $1-million-plus fencing project but that 
construction would start soon. Completion is expected in August. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for closing all of the streets in Park Labrea to outside 
traffic, except for Hauser Boulevard, a busy north-south thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the other streets were being used for internal circulation and this 
should not create much of an impact for the public," said Richard Jaramillo, 
the city's transportation engineer for the Hollywood-Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who put down a refundable deposit will be equipped with electronic 
devices to open any of 11 automatic gates for their cars, a statement issued by 
Forest City said. In addition, there will be three posts where security guards 
will clear visitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents to Get Keys 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be issued keys to open pedestrian gates at street intersections. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend in general to have enclosed communities," Kraden said. "The goal 
is to improve the quality of life in Park Labrea for the benefit of the 
residents there." 
</P>
<P>
The move was welcomed by City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the Park 
Labrea area and who took part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the 
fence-and-gate project. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five, six or seven years we've received continuous requests from 
residents in Park Labrea that there be some kind of fencing and gating to make 
it secure," said Sharon Keyser, Ferraro's planning deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of elderly people in the area, and they're concerned about 
outside people coming in. We endorsed it because of the community concern," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Glenn Ackerman, commanding patrol officer for the LAPD's Wilshire 
Division, said that police were aware of the residents' concerns but that 
statistics do not back them up. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever there are people, there's going to be crime. But I'm not aware of any 
significant violent crime (in Park Labrea) that's any different from anywhere 
else in the Wilshire Division," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Thomas Barnhart, a senior lead officer at the Wilshire Division, said 
there are so few crime reports from Park Labrea that most officers are not 
familiar with its maze-like streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (residents') perception of crimes is greater than the reality," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The installation of fences and gating will probably discourage all but the most 
determined criminals from trying to enter Park Labrea, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll harden the target. No question about it," he said. "That's a very 
effective thing to do to fight crime." 
</P>
<P>
The cost will be passed on to the tenants under provisions of the city's rent 
control law, Kraden said. The law allows landlords to charge renters for 
capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the newly formed Park Labrea Residents Assn. said reaction to 
the gating project was mixed among the estimated 10,000 residents of Park 
Labrea. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a number of folks, principally but not exclusively senior citizens, 
who are extremely security-conscious, and it's their view that the fencing and 
gating process can only enhance the security of the community," said David 
Hamlin, chairman of the group's communications committee. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, there are a number of folks, and I happen to be among them, 
who appreciate the security considerations but have grave reservations about 
the impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamlin said he was concerned about backed-up traffic at the entry and exit 
points during rush hours, especially if some of the older residents find it 
difficult to handle the electronic entry devices. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the proposed changes would alienate Park Labrea tenants from the 
surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point in the planning process were any tenants in this community 
consulted about anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraden said representatives of the association were invited to the 
ground-breaking ceremony last month. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was inhabited largely by senior citizens in previous decades, Park 
Labrea has been home to a more eclectic mix of residents in recent years, 
attracted by hardwood floors, views of the city and garden apartments that look 
out on grassy lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Laid out in a distinctive pinwheel pattern of squares and traffic circles, the 
complex contains 4,212 rental units.

SINKING UNITS HAVE FALLEN 40% IN VALUE, JURORS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An appraiser for homeowners in the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's 
sinking Monterey Hills housing complex said in court Monday that buildings in 
the Eaton Crest section of the subdivision have decreased in value by more than 
40% since their construction in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The appraiser, James O'Donnell, was the last of 24 witnesses called by 
attorneys for the homeowners in a Los Angeles Superior Court trial that has 
already lasted more than four months. The trial is to determine the loss of 
value and cost to repair 164 townhouses and condominiums that the Eaton Crest 
Homeowners Assn. contends are built on improperly compacted fill. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was brought by more than 200 homeowners and Security Pacific 
National Bank, the bond trustee on their mortgages. It is the second suit of 
five to go to trial, all brought by homeowner associations against the 
Community Redevelopment Agency and private firms involved in building the 
project. The suits were filed after homes in the development began tilting and 
cracking several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since other homeowners living in the same area as Eaton Crest have also filed 
suit, the trial may affect the course of other litigation yet to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drake Terrace Settlement 
</P>
<P>
The first suit brought by Monterey Hills homeowners against the CRA was settled 
last year when the agency agreed to pay Drake Terrace homeowners $6 million and 
to spend $3 million to repair their damaged homes. Drake Terrace is built on 
fill different from Eaton Crest's. 
</P>
<P>
Joel B. Castro, the homeowners' attorney, said he is building his case on the 
testimony of expert witnesses, city officials and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
He has said that he will prove that Eaton Crest homes are steadily sinking and 
that CRA plans to repair them are inadequate. He has also said he will prove 
that the homes have decreased and will continue to decrease significantly in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton Crest and another section of the 1,600-unit complex, Temple Terrace, sit 
on what once was Pullman Canyon. At its maximum depth, the canyon is filled 
with more than 120 feet of dirt, which has settled rapidly and unevenly. Since 
the early 1980s, cracks and other structural faults have appeared in some 
buildings built on the fill. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Monday, O'Donnell estimated that the fair market value of the 164 
Eaton Crest homes today is $10.4 million, more than $9.6 million less than 
their value in an undamaged condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repair Costs 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, three expert witnesses called by the defense estimated 
the Eaton Crest buildings would cost $18.3 million to repair. Attorneys for the 
homeowners are seeking damages to cover at least part of the loss of value and 
the cost to repair the homes. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' case rests in large part on whether their attorneys can 
persuade a jury and Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow that land underneath the 
subdivision will continue to settle. Witnesses for the homeowners have 
testified that it will. The seven defendants in the trial contend that further 
settling will be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Castro called a CRA consultant to the stand in an attempt to show 
that the agency had acknowledged the complex to be sinking at one time. The 
consultant, engineer James Slosson, headed a 1986 team hired by the agency to 
examine the fill. Slosson said in court that the fill underneath Eaton Crest 
may settle an additional 1% of its depth. 
</P>
<P>
Slosson also testified that extensive repairs are necessary to restore Eaton 
Crest and Temple Terrace to their original conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the CRA and the other defendants said they plan to call 21 
witnesses, including soils and engineering experts, appraisers and property 
managers in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Agency counsel Laurie Zelon and other attorneys for the defendants conceded in 
their opening statements that the Monterey Hills complex is damaged and that 
the homeowners are entitled to compensation, but said they will prove that the 
damage is cosmetic and requires less than $2 million in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they will show that the homes can be resold at market value even 
if no repairs are made on the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repairs Promised 
</P>
<P>
In the Drake Terrace suit last year, agency officials said repairs would be 
made to the Drake Terrace section as well as to Eaton Crest and Temple Terrace. 
The agency assurances were central to its defense in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the CRA said in their opening statements that they will prove 
that such repairs are no longer necessary. According to a study commissioned 
after the Drake Terrace case was settled, they said, the complex is sinking at 
a fraction of the rate previously believed and does not require extensive 
structural repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Slosson said he stands by the conclusions in the 1986 report, despite the 
existence of the new study contending that the repairs are unnecessary. "After 
going through Ft. Benning infantry school," Slosson said in court, "I seldom 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
Slosson's report recommends injecting grout into the soil underneath parts of 
Monterey Hills to stabilize the fill.

FAVORS BURBANK AIDE OVER ACTING REPLACEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER CITY CLERK SNUBS THE PAST, BACKS OUTSIDER FOR JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From his retirement home in Mission Viejo, longtime Glendale City Clerk Merle 
Hagemeyer has challenged the established line of succession regarding his 
former job by endorsing an outsider over his deputy of nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Three candidates, including Acting City Clerk Aileen C. Boyle, are seeking the 
top job in the clerk's office in the April municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
Hagemeyer, who retired Jan. 1, said he will support Jeri A. Browne, an employee 
in the Burbank city clerk's office, to replace Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle has worked for the Glendale clerk's office for 21 years, moving up 
through the ranks in the same manner as the past two clerks. 
</P>
<P>
Hagemeyer had been appointed acting clerk by the City Council in 1977 and ran 
unopposed for office the next year. 
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Frank Usher, also had been appointed acting city clerk by city 
officials, and was subsequently elected, Hagemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, this year's pathway to the city clerk's office is crowded with 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
For Boyle, who was a deputy city clerk since 1980, that means having to earn 
the position in a competitive election. 
</P>
<P>
She said her main asset is hands-on experience. "I've been working with the 
same group of people for years, and I believe we've done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years Boyle attended election management and record-keeping seminars 
on her own time to keep up with the latest developments in her field, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Complex Job' 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely complex and demanding job," Boyle said. "You have to pay a 
lot of attention to detail." 
</P>
<P>
Hagemeyer, however, prefers Browne. "Based on experience, management skills and 
rapport with the public, I believe that Browne would best serve the City of 
Glendale," Hagemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne has worked in Burbank's city clerk's office for the past 16 years, 
although she has lived in Glendale for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
She said her goals include the creation of a records management and archives 
program "to preserve the history of the city," and to store backup microfilm 
copies of transcripts of all City Council meetings in a safe place, to prevent 
their destruction by fire or earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Browne is active in several job-related national and state organizations. 
</P>
<P>
She is president of the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Assn. of Records, 
Managers and Administrators and Burbank chapter secretary of the National 
Management Assn., and served on the 1987 City Clerk Handbook Committee for the 
City Clerks Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
"She has an excellent reputation," Hagemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said Hagemeyer has endorsed the challenger because he and Browne are 
personal friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He picked a business acquaintance over a business relationship," she said. 
"I'd do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Hagemeyer would not praise or criticize his former deputy. When asked about 
Boyle, he answered "no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Jon Erikson, a 21-year veteran of the city Engineering Department, rounds 
out the field of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lacks city clerk experience, Erikson said, he has become familiar 
with many aspects of the city clerk's duties by writing draft ordinances and 
City Council reports for his department. 
</P>
<P>
"After 21 years of service for the city of Glendale, I want to expand my role 
and improve the city clerk's office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Erikson said the city clerk's office needs improvement in making "more 
information more readily available" to the public. "I don't know yet if the 
city clerk's decision or if the council regulates the flow of information. I'll 
have to look into that." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle dismissed Erikson's claim as a non-issue. "We go out of our way to help 
the public," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's city clerk is responsible for transcribing council meetings, 
maintaining records, supervising elections and issuing licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The city clerk's starting salary is $3,370 monthly.

GLENDALE TO ERASE ERROR ON APARTMENT MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council will take a second vote to extend the city's 
apartment building moratorium, this time allowing five days for public comment 
to make sure the action is legal. 
</P>
<P>
In its haste to extend the moratorium, the council on Jan. 10 ignored a City 
Charter requirement that an ordinance be enacted only after a five-day waiting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The city made the same mistake in September and got caught. In a December 
ruling, Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel said the city's initial moratorium of 
Sept. 27 had been improperly enacted because the public received no chance to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel allowed the moratorium to stand, saying it would have become effective by 
then anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But last Thursday when a group of Glendale developers informed her about the 
extension, Vogel criticized Glendale officials for ignoring her ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of unclean hands jumps out at me," Vogel told Assistant City 
Atty. Scott Howard at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said he did not know how the council had taken the action. "I am the 
litigator. . . . I am not the city attorney," Howard said. "I know they 
extended it only from reading it in the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel has been hearing the developers' challenge to the moratorium, which so 
far has been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling on reconsideration of her first ruling is expected in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Thursday that she was inclined to let it stand. 
</P>
<P>
But she advised the city to correct its mistake to save itself "some time and 
aggravation and another court appearance." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David Ramsey acknowledged that the city made a mistake in adopting 
the extension without notice. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff sincerely apologizes," he told the council. "The ordinance will be 
discussed today and placed on the agenda for next week." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said she would reluctantly follow Vogel's 
instructions. "I personally don't think we made a mistake," she said, "but we 
have to cover all the bases." 
</P>
<P>
The initial 150-day moratorium was adopted Sept. 27 to prevent an overflow of 
building permit applications during reevaluation of the city's building and 
zoning codes. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council extended it until April 24 because the city was unable to draw 
up new guidelines in time. 
</P>
<P>
The Moratorium Litigation Committee, a consortium of developers, sued the city 
in November and asked the court to order that the moratorium be lifted.

AIRPORT COMPLEX; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA SEEKS CLARITY ON LAND USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Santa Monica City Council want a detailed explanation of the 
argument their staff is using to rebut claims that a $280-million office 
complex planned for Santa Monica Airport is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project last week cited official documents to claim that the 
land was designated as a park more than 60 years ago and cannot be used for 
anything else unless the city's voters say so. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, headed by Mar Vista homeowner Gregory Thomas, demanded in a 
letter to all seven City Council members that Santa Monica voters be allowed to 
decide what is done with the land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Attorney 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Robert M. Myers and other staff officials said that the claims were 
bogus and that the land-use issue had been resolved years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several council members said this week that they wanted to see it 
in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure we've crossed our t's and dotted our i's," Councilman Herb 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the council members' concerns, a formal legal opinion from an 
outside consulting attorney will be delivered to the council within 10 days, 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The airport land was purchased for use as a park when voters approved an 
$860,000 bond issue in 1926. The state Legislature expanded the definition of 
park the next year to include an airport, and the land has been the site of an 
airport and open space ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and his attorney, J. Peter Fiske, argue that promises made in a 
voter-approved bond issue -- in this case, that the land will be a park -- are 
forever binding unless the voters say differently. 
</P>
<P>
This week Fiske offered what he said was further backing of his position: an 
article of the California Government Code, called the Municipal Park 
Abandonment Law of 1939, that states the same principle. 
</P>
<P>
But the city contends that once the bonds were paid off in 1965, the promises 
were null and void. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Judy Abdo, Ken Genser and David Finkel also said they planned 
to meet with City Manager John Jalili or city attorneys to discuss the 
questions raised over the airport land. 
</P>
<P>
Genser, one of the newest members of the council and a leading proponent of 
slow growth, said there appeared to be some merit to the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"In some sense, a part of me hopes it's true so that the airport project 
doesn't go forward as proposed," Genser said. "However, this might tie the 
city's hands more than I would want." 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to demands from area homeowners and others who oppose the project, the 
city has already agreed to scale back the complex from an originally proposed 
1.4 million square feet to about 1 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The city owns the land and stands to receive millions of dollars from the 
project, which, if finally approved, will be built by the Reliance Development 
Group.

4 ARTISTS' WORK ARISES FROM ASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think your office is a mess, you should see where Ventura Arts Council 
Director Maureen Davidson works. 
</P>
<P>
The white walls of the council's Momentum Gallery are covered with the remains 
of a Ventura house destroyed by fire. On the gray carpet are 16 tons of gravel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard to walk," Davidson said after the multimedia work in 
hardware, ashes and other debris -- entitled "Transformations: Four Artists" -- 
was completed Saturday at the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura sculptor Paul Lindhard; his former students, Robert Catalusci and Steve 
Knauff, and his neighbor, Dan Layman, created the work in a marathon four-day 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
For Davidson, the artwork is worth the inconvenience. She said the display of 
smoke-damaged wallpaper and blackened window frames, doors and hutches is 
Ventura County's first "art installation" -- art that includes the exhibition 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this exhibit will cause one to question one's environment and wonder, 
'What is art?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
It did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sympathy to Outrage 
</P>
<P>
One of the gallery's downtown neighbors complained about oil leaking from a 
burnt-out 1950 Cadillac, which is part of "Transformations" but outside the 
gallery. Visitors offered reactions ranging from sympathy to outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people come in and ask, 'Did the Arts Council burn down?' " 
gallery worker Liz Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
It burned with creative energy, to hear the artists tell it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something gratifying about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear," 
Lindhard said. "It seems like much more of an accomplishment than making a 
beautiful ring from a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
The effort did not go unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
"I put in that dead bolt," said Claudio Landeros, who was gesturing toward the 
front door of the house that he and his wife Magdelino had bought in 1987 and 
had hoped to move into later this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
November Fire 
</P>
<P>
Its frame, the lock and a brass doorknob remained intact after the November 
fire on Dubbers Street near Lindhard's sculpture supply house and Layman's auto 
salvage yard. Investigators think that squatters started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
A demolition team hired by Landeros initially prevented the artists from 
removing the house's remains last Tuesday. But Catalusci, a sculptor who likes 
to fire his wood images "to give them spirit," and Knauff, who has erected 
artworks similar to "Transformations" in the San Francisco Bay Area, talked the 
workers into letting them take what they could in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The artists' efforts so impressed the demolition team that they were allowed to 
continue, Catalusci said. "They were like, 'Hey, wow, we should hire you guys.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 50 or so visitors at Saturday's opening were equally appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runs Through Feb. 27 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm in art," one man said about the exhibition, which runs through 
Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting fur coats and carrying glasses of champagne, they trudged through the 
gravel to ponder the patterns in the burnt wood, which struck Ventura attorney 
Patricia J. Olney as similar to "the fake Persian lamb coat I got to go to 
Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
The same group will be invited to return to the gallery later this month after 
Ventura composer Jeff Kaiser and Simi Valley graphics artist and echo-chamber 
expert Ted Killian compose music based on "Transformations." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser said the composition will probably involve electronic trumpet and baby 
toys.

JAPANESE FASCINATED BY GOLF WHETHER ON LINKS OR ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kagehisa Toyama isn't the only Japanese who is gonzo for golf. 
</P>
<P>
A craze for the sport has overtaken his country in recent years, making the 
American devotion to baseball and football tepid by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, golf club memberships, which average about $200,000, are bought and 
sold on the open market as speculative commodities. Admission to Tokyo's posh 
Koganei Country Club carries a price tag of $2.4 million. Just playing a round 
usually runs several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
When Japanese golfers compete in U.S. tournaments, their every move is 
broadcast live to millions of fans back home, often in the wee hours of the 
morning. During the 1987 U.S. Open, for instance, only two competitors were 
Japanese, but a press corps of more than 100 Japanese journalists followed them 
across the links. 
</P>
<P>
"There is probably no nationality in the world that has the fascination for 
golf that the Japanese have," said Rich Skyzinski, media relations manager for 
the U.S. Golf Assn. "It's simply phenomenal. The media in Japan cover golf more 
so than any other media in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese passion for the sport can be traced to 1957, when Pete Nakamura 
won individual honors at the World Cup and then joined with partner Koichi Ono 
to beat the U.S. team, which included stars Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of more Japanese golfers to the world-class level in the last 10 years 
has helped fuel that love. Ayako Okamoto, one of the top female players in the 
world today, is practically a national heroine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copying Americans 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the makeup of the people there -- they always try to copy the 
Americans," said Hiro Hishiki, publisher of the Little Tokyo-based California 
Japanese Daily News. "And they live in such an insular country. Whenever a 
craze takes hold, it's just like a wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
Explanations for golf's intense popularity in Japan vary. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the several million followers of the Church of Perfect Liberty are 
urged to use the sport as a means for achieving spiritual fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
The church, founded in 1946 by Tokuchika Miki, the son of a Buddhist priest, 
preaches that when human affairs are approached as art, then life becomes a 
creative endeavor capable of inspiring religious exaltation. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not envy those who belong to exclusive golf clubs!" wrote Miki, who died in 
1983. "We will provide golf courses for you -- the finest in the land. Relate 
the principles of golf to life. Live for the satisfaction of the artistic 
life." JESSE KATZ

NOW GROUP CITES CHILD-CUSTODY BIAS IN FAMILY LAW COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women upset with their divorce and child-custody proceedings complained about 
alleged discrimination in Ventura County Family Law Court at a state judicial 
committee hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Their complaints drew a sharp response from Ventura Superior Court Judge Allan 
L. Steele, who blamed a small group of women for stirring up hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
Women in divorce or child custody cases "are convinced after going to meetings 
with these people that there is no justice in Ventura County and they go into 
the attorney's office almost in hysterics," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
The group to which he referred is NOW Court Watch, a task force of the 
Ventura-Oxnard chapter of the National Organization for Women founded last 
summer to monitor the county's family law courts. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge acknowledged that the women have some valid complaints. Laws 
governing family courts make it difficult for women with limited resources, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Humongous Gaps' 
</P>
<P>
"It irritates me. I understand how they feel. There are humongous gaps in the 
system that can't be addressed by the judiciary and must be addressed by the 
Legislature," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
NOW Court Watch has received more than 200 calls from women who claim that they 
have encountered difficulties with judges, mediators and psychologists in the 
Ventura County Family Law Court, said NOW spokeswoman Lucianne Ranni. 
</P>
<P>
NOW also wants family law cases to be heard exclusively by the county's family 
law judges -- Steele and Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson. The judges 
are appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court, usually for 
two-year periods. But because of the high caseload, family law issues are 
sometimes decided by judges without expertise in this area, a practice that NOW 
says puts women at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
"When women have taken the initiative, they have had their paper work ignored 
by judges and have been chastised for coming into court without an attorney," 
Ranni said at Monday's hearing in Los Angeles of the Judicial Council Advisory 
Committee on Gender Bias in the Courts. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is holding five hearings throughout the state and will compile 
testimony in a report to the Judicial Council of California, a group of judges, 
attorneys and other experts appointed by two successive chief justices of the 
state Supreme Court. The report might then will be presented to the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
NOW has urged those involved in such cases to contact the media. Local 
newspapers have been flooded by such letters in recent months; The Times has 
received about two dozen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Publishing Book 
</P>
<P>
Typical is a letter from Faith Johnson O'Leary of Ventura, who says she is 
publishing a book about the psychological trauma suffered by families under the 
judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions made in the Ventura County Family Law Court "are so patently 
illogical, counter-factual and contrary to well-established state and federal 
laws that they would be laughable were it not for the emotional and financial 
suffering inflicted on people who are victimized by this system," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
Many who echo O'Leary's comments cite the case of Pamela Besser, whose 
6-year-old son Joshua was ordered by the court to spend three weeks each month 
living with his mother in San Francisco and one week each month living with his 
father in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In September, on the recommendation of the family court's senior mediator, 
Ventura Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath ruled that the child should 
remain in Ventura County, forcing Besser to move and leave behind a fledgling 
health-care newsletter that she had started. 
</P>
<P>
However, a family law attorney who practices in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, said the gender bias problem is no worse in Ventura than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is systemic and institutional -- it's a problem in the whole state 
of California," Hannah-Beth Jackson, a member of the state Senate Task Force on 
Family Equity, said at Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines that exist today are wholly inadequate. At the end of the 
divorce, the woman, if she's lucky, is going to tread water and will probably 
be moving backwards," Jackson testified. 
</P>
<P>
Although Steele and NOW differ on many family law issues, the judge agrees with 
the group that women with children usually are the financial losers in a 
divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides also believe that the courts should provide experienced legal 
counsel to women who lack the means to hire lawyers. Presently, women embroiled 
in custody or divorce battles must hire their own attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs of $100,000 
</P>
<P>
"We have cases of women having $100,000 attorney fees and court costs over the 
course of a custody dispute," Ranni said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, women with limited funds hire attorneys who lack the experience 
necessary to argue a custody hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many lawyers who are practicing family law who should not be," 
Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, NOW's Ventura County chapter submitted a list of five 
recommendations to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The NOW recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory training for all judges and mediators so they can recognize and 
overcome bias based on gender, culture and race. 
</P>
<P>
A sliding scale for legal costs, requiring the partner with more money to pay a 
greater share. 
</P>
<P>
Increased child support awards. 
</P>
<P>
A study on the effects of joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of more female and minority judges. 
</P>
<P>
Steele pointed out that he and Johnson teach continuing-education courses in 
family law for judges in Berkeley each summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gender Neutrality' 
</P>
<P>
Their two-week seminar includes a section on "gender neutrality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steele added that the Ventura Family Law Court is willing to meet with any 
organization or person, and he denied the claims of some mothers that an "old 
boy's network" in the courts discriminates against women. 
</P>
<P>
"Would an old boy's network include a female judge?" he asked. "It's untrue; it 
does not exist. This kind of condemnation of the system and court does a 
disservice to the citizens of the community who rely on this court to provide 
them with justice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, both sides say they are concerned about the effect 
of prolonged court battles on children. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids 2 years old with ulcers who have attempted suicide all because 
of the stress of two parents who hate each other while the kids love both of 
them," Steele said.

LONG BEACH SEEKS OUTTAKES IN POLICE STING CONTROVERSY 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is asking a Superior Court judge to force NBC to turn over complete 
videotapes of an incident in which a white officer allegedly pushed a black man 
into a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office is also seeking to compel the black man, Don 
Jackson, and his companion on the night of the Jan. 14 incident to give them 
the names and addresses of all witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy city attorney said he has been seeking the information to aid in the 
investigation of the so-called sting in which Jackson, in conjunction with a 
group working against police brutality, hoped to expose misconduct by Long 
Beach police officers. NBC videotaped the incident for a segment on the group's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Want to See' Outtakes 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to discover what the heck they've got," Senior Deputy City Atty. 
Robert E. Shannon said. "I have no idea. There may be some things on the 
outtakes, and we want to see them." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has refused to turn over any videotape that was not broadcast. Its 
executives say the network has a policy against releasing outtakes. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Thomas E. Beck -- representing Jackson, who is on leave from his job 
as a Hawthorne police sergeant, and companion Jeff Hill -- said he will allow 
questioning of the men if the city agrees not to prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said questioning by the city would breech their constitutional 
rights against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said any request for immunity from prosecution would have to be 
directed to the city prosecutor. A judge has scheduled a hearing Feb. 14 to 
review the city's petition to subpoena the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
The city, the FBI and the district attorney's office have been conducting 
separate investigations of the incident in which Jackson and Hill acted as 
decoys to see whether they, as black men in shabby clothes and driving an old 
car, would be stopped by police and mistreated. They invited NBC's Today show 
along. 
</P>
<P>
An NBC video camera recorded Officer Mark Dickey as he appeared to swear at 
Jackson, to push Jackson's head into a plate-glass window and to throw him onto 
a squad car. Dickey reacted, the tape appeared to show, after Jackson heatedly 
questioned the officer about why their car had been stopped, then hesitated in 
submitting to a search for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, Jackson's attorney, said he does not know whether criminal charges are 
contemplated against Jackson or Hill. But he said questions asked by police 
investigators indicated that officials may be thinking about charges. 
</P>
<P>
One team of officers advised Hill of his Miranda protections against 
self-incrimination before questioning Hill after the incident, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Trip Into City 
</P>
<P>
A separate team of police internal affairs officers who are investigating 
possible police misconduct, asked Hill questions that did not relate to the 
incident, for example seeking information about a previous trip into Long Beach 
by the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service, the anti-brutality group. 
</P>
<P>
(During one night in December, Jackson -- with a camera crew following in 
another vehicle -- drove around Beverly Hills for one hour and Long Beach for 
more than three hours without incident. At one point, a Long Beach officer 
turned on his emergency lights and prepared to stop Jackson's car, but broke 
off to handle a radio call instead, according to a spokesman for the referral 
service. 
</P>
<P>
(It was on the second try, Jan. 14, that the Jackson-Hill car was stopped by 
Dickey and partner Mark Ramsey minutes after entering Long Beach. The officers 
said the car had been weaving across the center line of Pacific Coast Highway.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone to the interview with internal affairs, and they are asking 
questions to incriminate Jackson, Hill and and anyone else involved with this," 
Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
Beck said he supplied police with a copy of a second videotape made by the 
anti-brutality group from another vehicle on the night of the incident. He said 
the tape would have been moved into evidence anyway after the filing of a claim 
and a subsequent lawsuit alleging police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 to 50 claims and 15 to 20 lawsuits are filed against the Long Beach 
Police Department each year alleging misconduct, according to Shannon of the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
As police and other officials continued investigating the incident, the Long 
Beach City Council agreed Tuesday to study a proposal for police reforms put 
forth by clergymen alarmed by the Jackson incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen ministers and rabbis asked the council for changes that would include 
more human-relations training for officers, opening a police substation in the 
minority community and creating a citizen oversight panel to air complaints 
about police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Clarence Smith, chairman of the Quality of Life Committee, said he 
hopes that the panel can return recommendations for action by the council 
within a month. The committee's initial hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday 
in the City Council chambers at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Berry, president of the Long Beach branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, told the council that his organization urges the 
resignation and prosecution of Dickey in the Jackson incident. He also accused 
the officer of lying on his subsequent report. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey has been assigned to detective work pending the outcome of the internal 
police investigation.

DIGEST: SOUTH GATE; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL SHELTER TO BE CLOSED JULY 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has announced 
it will close its South Gate animal shelter July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, which has been in the same location for 39 years, is too old and 
too small, said Edward C. Cubrda, executive director of the Los Angeles SPCA. 
The nonprofit organization, which contracts with six Southeast cities including 
South Gate, has leased the building from the city of South Gate. The current 
three-year lease expires July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The society, whose services include animal control and animal abuse 
investigations, has wanted to purchase the land but the city was not willing to 
sell. The site is in a redevelopment project area, Cubrda said. 
</P>
<P>
Animals in the South Gate shelter will be transferred to other animal control 
agencies in the area or to the SPCA's main shelter in Los Angeles or its 
Hawthorne shelter, Cubrda said. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting is scheduled at 10 a.m. Feb. 10 at South Gate City Hall to discuss 
what the six contract cities will do to continue providing animal services.

HOSPICE OFFICIAL RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The founder and executive director of an organization that operates Hughes 
House and two other AIDS hospices, has resigned under pressure, officials of 
Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Wolff resigned at the request of the nonprofit organization's board of 
directors two weeks ago after dissatisfaction with his handling of the agency's 
financial accounts, said an official who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said little about Wolff's departure beyond a prepared statement 
last week by board Vice President Marc Berman, who said Wolff was asked to 
leave "to preserve the agency's viability and our high standards of care." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said that Wolff had not been accused of embezzling funds but that the 
board had decided "his spending priorities were not consistent with the board's 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wolff nor Berman was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Hughes House, which has five beds for patients with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach operates an 11-bed hospice 
in Long Beach and a five-bed facility in the San Fernando Valley. The 
organization was founded in 1987.

ARCHITECTS CITE GOOD DESIGN IN HOUSING, DEALERSHIP, SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
30 ECONOMICALLY VARIED ENTRIES MARK RENEWAL OF CONTEST AFTER 10-YEAR ABSENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a lapse of a decade, the Ventura County chapter of the American Institute 
of Architects has renewed its awards for design, citing a mix of projects from 
a car dealership to a housing project for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of the entire groupings of entries tended to reflect not only the 
current state of the economy, but the kind of future we are headed toward," 
said James H. Azbell, local AIA president. "I particularly enjoyed the fact 
that one of the winners was a car dealership because, as Southern Californians, 
we are married to our vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve architectural firms entered the competition with a total of 30 projects. 
The competition was open to architects who practice in Ventura County or to 
those who have done projects in the county. Judges were from outside the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Ceased 
</P>
<P>
Azbell said the competition, which is to be held every two years, ceased 10 
years ago because of the work involved in staging it. 
</P>
<P>
The winners are Rasmussen &amp; Associates, Ventura, honor award for Thompson 
Plaza Retail Center, Ventura, and merit award for Gold Coast Acura, Ventura; 
Scott Ellinwood &amp; Associates, Ventura, honor award for Templeman 
Educational Center in Port Hueneme; M &amp; V Architects, Texas, merit award 
for private residence in Ojai; John V. Mutlow, Los Angeles, merit award for 
Cabrillo Village farm workers housing, Saticoy, and Zelma Wilson, Ojai, merit 
award for Oak Grove Secondary School in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson Plaza Retail Center is a 15,600-square-foot building with commercial 
and auto service facilities, designed on a sloping corner lot. Because the site 
faces a busy street, the architect designed the building so the slope allowed 
the auto service functions to be partly inserted under the retail space, 
screening it from surrounding properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Citation 
</P>
<P>
The Templeman Educational Center, which houses the administrative offices of 
the Hueneme School District, also received a national citation jointly from the 
AIA and the American Assn. of School Administrators. Not only was the building 
designed to maximize natural light, but the steeply pitched roof was added to 
discourage skateboarders and bicycle riders, who have plagued some of the 
district's other facilities, according to an AIA statement. 
</P>
<P>
The building, built by the city of Port Hueneme for the school district, is 
across from Port Hueneme's City Hall, which has similar architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Coast Acura, in the Ventura Auto Center, is a 16,500-square-foot building 
on a 2.3-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up with a one-of-a-kind design for the building and it worked pretty 
well," said David Sargent, vice president of Rasmussen &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent said the firm wanted to achieve the same feeling in the service bays 
that it had in the showroom. "We tried to make them all look good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrillo Village is low-income farm worker housing surrounded by lemon groves. 
It originally was a farm worker camp, with deteriorated board-and-batten cabins 
built in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Mutlow designed the new village with flat roofs, solid walls and earth colors 
reminiscent of Mexican adobes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private School 
</P>
<P>
Oak Grove Secondary School is a private school built by the Krishnamurti 
Foundation. It is "woven around beautiful oak trees," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The campus, set on 150 acres, includes five other buildings. Wilson said she 
attempted to consider the movement of people, particularly the safe circulation 
of children from parents' cars. 
</P>
<P>
The building has a large open skylight atrium, and various vistas of the 
property can be viewed from the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the design awards are a way "to see how well the architect resolved 
the problem as presented to them by the client on the particular piece of 
property. . . . I tried to use materials most appropriate to making it look 
like it belonged there." 
</P>
<P>
The AIA chapter has about 75 members, mostly from the western end of the 
county, Azbell said.

SNAPSHOTS: JOAN ORR: A LIFE LIVED WITH VIGOR IN THE FACE OF FATAL DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Orr never canceled a dance class. When unable to stand, she taught from a 
wheelchair. When her voice became too weak for a microphone, she scribbled 
notes to an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year has passed since Orr's last class. Yet the memories of her life 
continue to teach lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"She showed us courage," said her husband, Verne Orr. "And a message about not 
giving in and still trying to give to others." 
</P>
<P>
That determination to help people -- even in her last days as she struggled 
with a debilitating disease -- is the subject of a video documentary, "A 
Question of Balance, the Life of Joan Orr." 
</P>
<P>
It will be presented at 7 p.m. Sunday at Polytechnic School in Pasadena as part 
of a tribute honoring Orr. A contribution of $5 is requested. Seating is 
limited and reservations may be made by calling (818) 795-0825 or 793-0760. 
</P>
<P>
The Light-Bringer Project, a group of artists and writers, and the Pasadena 
Community Access Corp., a nonprofit organization run by Pasadena to provide 
public access to cable, co-produced the documentary. Orr was filmed in some of 
her last dance sessions before her death last April at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Her spirit was challenged but never dominated by the ravaging effects of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative neuromuscular disorder also 
known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the video, dancers bend, sway and twist to music as Joan Orr encourages them 
to explore their creativity and their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"All of her dance had therapy in it," her husband explained. "She found that it 
was a tremendous release of emotions, and she was extremely successful in 
helping people." Through the medium of dance, Orr was able to reach out to a 
diverse range of students. 
</P>
<P>
Dance was always a part of her life. In the late 1930s, she danced while a 
student at Scripps College in Claremont, and later taught there. When the Orrs, 
both natives of Des Moines, Iowa, moved to Pasadena in the 1940s, she began to 
teach dance classes at local churches and schools -- up to seven classes a 
week. One day her pupils might be 5-year-olds; another day she'd work with 
alcoholic women from a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Her talents extended beyond the dance studio. As president of the Pasadena Arts 
Council in 1977 and 1978, Orr is remembered by those who worked with her as a 
rare and inspirational leader. She presided over monthly board meetings, aiming 
to bring more cultural events, including dance, to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"She brought out the best in others and was dedicated to the belief that all 
cultural arts were not a luxury but an essential part of the community," said 
Randell Makinson, curator and director of the Gamble House in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
During her terms as president of the arts council, Orr became acquainted with 
dancer Bella Lewitzky. The two became friends and shortly thereafter, Orr 
became the first person to chair the Lewitzky Dance Foundation and the 
affiliated Dance Gallery Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"She was gentle, beautiful and good," Lewitzky said. "Very few people fit that 
adjective: good." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, President Reagan appointed Verne Orr secretary of the Air Force. 
Earlier, when Reagan was governor of California, Orr had served as state 
finance director for five years and as head of the Department of Motor 
Vehicles. "She probably visited 100 bases," Verne Orr recalled. "She never went 
to museums or went shopping. She was on duty." 
</P>
<P>
As her husband peered inside aircraft hangars and inspected flight lines, Joan 
Orr visited hospitals and child-care centers, meeting Air Force wives and 
families. She was sensitive to their lonely, often transient life styles and 
lent a supportive ear to their problems, her husband said. At Christmas, the 
Orrs would travel to remote bases in Greenland and Alaska to visit servicemen 
separated from their families. 
</P>
<P>
Verne Orr's tenure as secretary of the Air Force was cut short when his wife 
was diagnosed as having ALS in June, 1985. After doctors predicted that she had 
only three years to live, the Orrs decided to return to Pasadena. The Air Force 
honored her by initiating the Joan Peak Orr Award, to be given annually to an 
Air Force wife who makes an outstanding contribution to the service. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to Pasadena in the fall of 1985, Orr walked with the help of 
crutches. A month later, she required a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"She refused to be pitied and never asked for sympathy," her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, a former student, Carole Babcock, suggested that Orr 
start her dance classes again. With Babcock's assistance, music and dance soon 
filled the Orr's living room each Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful to watch Joan in class," Babcock said. "You could see the 
strength coming back to her body. She said that she felt energized; that in a 
sense, she was dancing through us." 
</P>
<P>
Weeks passed, and with each Monday session, Orr's disease weakened first her 
voice, then her other muscles. Gradually, her microphone was replaced by a 
writing slate and Orr jotted dance instructions to Babcock, who then acted out 
the movements. 
</P>
<P>
Orr taught the class until two weeks before her death. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky remembers calling her a week before she died. "She spoke so positively 
and with a sense of well-being," Lewitzky said. "She was determined to make 
every moment count."

artistry, primarily from the Ch'ing Dynasty (1644-1911), are dazzling visitors 
to an exhibit at Lang Gallery at Scripps College in Claremont. The exhibit, 
which will run through Feb. 12, includes an 80th-birthday greeting in the form 
20-by-12-foot tapestry, delivered in 1779; a pair of four-inch embroidered 
shoes for the bound feet of women, and a civil dignitary hat and horsehair 
whisks, viewed by Ginny Nishigaya. The exhibition was organized from the 
permanent collections of the Claremont Colleges by students at Pitzer, Pomona 
and Scripps colleges. LOU MACK / Los Angeles Times

INVESTMENT CEILING LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has eliminated restrictions on how much the city can invest in 
two types of short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-0 vote last week, the City Council removed $500,000 limits on city 
investments in repurchase agreements, which are money market accounts backed by 
bonds, and on banker's acceptances, money market accounts based on letters of 
credit issued by a bank. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Danner, the city's director of finance, said he proposed the change 
because the former policy was too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old policy, said Danner, the city in early January had a difficult 
time temporarily investing nearly $7 million it withdrew from its investment 
portfolio to pay a legal settlement. While waiting for attorneys to reach an 
agreement, the city had to hold the money for three days before forwarding it 
to the recipient, Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
During those three days, the city was unable to invest in repurchase agreements 
or banker's acceptances because of the dollar limits, and certificates of 
deposits were unavailable because sufficient collateral could not be obtained 
from qualified institutions, said Danner. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city lost about $1,500 a day in interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amended investment policy approved last week also expanded the number of 
banks in which the city may invest, from the top five to the top six in 
California. The change would allow the city to invest with Sanwa Bank, where 
the city has its main account.

DOWNTOWN REDESIGN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, concerned by the surge in trendy shopping malls across the 
Westside, presented plans for the redesign of the central business district at 
a breakfast meeting of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce and Civic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautification as an end in itself is not worthwhile. It should be a means to 
an end, as part of a reinvestment strategy," said Bob Walsh, deputy city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The urban design proposals, which include street-side flower pots, 
granite-banded sidewalks and special lighting, are part of a proposal that 
would include parking structures and other capital improvements for the 
downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints from business people on streets that are not part of 
the central business district, Walsh said the city would undertake similar 
studies for their areas if asked.

ELDERLY WARNED OF THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are warning the elderly to beware of a roving band of thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the warning was prompted by two incidents last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, three women and four children, ages 4 to 6, asked to enter an 
elderly woman's home on the pretext of needing to use the bathroom, Lt. Ellis 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, the children became unruly, distracting the resident, while the 
women moved to a bedroom and stole money and jewelry valued at $1,000, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The same scam was repeated later that day at another residence, apparently by 
the same people, police said. The suspects made off with more than $10,000 in 
checks, jewelry and money, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the adult suspects as having dark complexions, weighing about 
135 pounds and about 5 feet, 3 inches tall. They were 30 to 35 years old and 
wore short floral skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said bands of roving thieves appear annually and usually prey on the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned senior citizens to beware of people who offer to do inexpensive 
yard or roof-repair work, then take the money without performing the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main purpose is to get the message out to senior citizens," Smith said. 
"Never turn large sums of money over to anyone, especially strangers, no matter 
how promising the opportunity appears. Don't hesitate to check credentials on 
salesmen, government officials or anyone who comes to the door representing any 
organization. And don't let strangers into your house, regardless of the nature 
of the alleged emergency."

SCOPE: ON SATURDAY, A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S PLACE IS IN THE MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday. If you are 13, it means a shopping mall, a glittering material 
paradise to bound through, which is what Jenny Sullivan, Nicole Parsons and 
Acacia Robles are doing this morning at Lakewood Center Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Their pace is incredible. With arms linked, they walk rapidly from store to 
store on legs that before the day is over will feel the burden of what surely 
will add up to miles. 
</P>
<P>
Unencumbered by adults, they roam freely. They have the delicious feeling, so 
frequent at that age and so infrequent after it, that comes from knowing you 
don't have to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
"We look for boys, say hi to people we know and if we see a shop we like, we go 
in it," Jenny said. 
</P>
<P>
They enter one that sells records, tapes and posters. There are posters of 
Donald Duck, Michael Jordan and Madonna, but the girls fasten their attention 
only on those of Heavy Metal rock stars posed unsmiling with their guitars. 
</P>
<P>
One of those groups is Guns 'N Roses, but Acacia already owns their poster. 
Their songs, she says, include "Paradise City" and "Sweet Child o' Mine." 
</P>
<P>
The song playing over the store loud speaker system is a late-'70s number by 
Fleetwood Mac -- another era. 
</P>
<P>
"Never heard of them," Jenny said, ". . . but my dad probably has." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Footwear Is Black and White 
</P>
<P>
She wears a plaid shirt and red knee-length shorts. Nicole has on a decorated 
T-shirt and denim shorts, Acacia a plaid shirt and jeans. All wear black socks 
and white sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny and Acacia are 13, Nicole is almost 13. They wish they were older. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen," Jenny said, "so I could drive." 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen," Acacia said, "so I could get a job and a car." 
</P>
<P>
Nicole's answer is 19, but she gives no reason. 
</P>
<P>
They look at the tapes lining the shelves, and notice two boys standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask them if they skate," Nicole whispered to Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny walks over to the boys, but the conversation is brief. The boys look at 
her without expression. They look older than 13. 
</P>
<P>
The girls say there are not many cute boys at their school, Jefferson Junior 
High in Long Beach. And Acacia adds, "Most of them are really short." 
</P>
<P>
At Sweat &amp; Surf, they search through a rack of T-shirts on pink hangers. 
They prefer the black ones with skulls on them for $12.95. R-i-i-i-i-p. Velcro 
wallets are opened, allowances extracted. Jenny and Nicole each buy a shirt and 
some skateboarding magazines. 
</P>
<P>
At school, Jenny says, because she and Nicole are the only two girl 
skateboarders, she is sometimes known as a "Skater Chick." 
</P>
<P>
Acacia, who is not a skateboarder, wants to find a copy of Hit Parader, a rock 
music magazine, so they go next to a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
"They're boring," Jenny says of bookstores. "I'll wait outside." 
</P>
<P>
"They're interesting," says Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is eaten at Burger King, where they ponder what is important to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an important thing in my life . . . food, I guess," Acacia said, 
looking at the hamburgers and French fries on the table in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably making good friends," Nicole offered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's corny," Jenny said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny and Acacia throw french fries at each other. 
</P>
<P>
The video game arcade is supposed to be the best place to meet boys, so they go 
there after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got about three bucks left," Acacia said. 
</P>
<P>
The arcade is full of boys, but they have eyes only for the animated screens of 
the pulsing, beeping machines they are playing. The three girls leave quickly 
and go on to a department store where they buy a shopping bag for a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The carefree day continues. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing hard or anything," Acacia says of life as she and her friends 
look at their reflections in the ceiling of an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
But Jenny complains, "They (adults) treat us like we're stupid or something." 
</P>
<P>
Because Acacia is the only one of the three who wears makeup, the others kid 
her as she goes into a drug store to look for some. Instead, she buys a small 
mirror. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feet Start to Hurt 
</P>
<P>
They walk outside and cross a street to see what is playing at a theater and 
how much it costs to get in. They decide against a movie. It is now past 3. 
</P>
<P>
"This gets boring after a while," Nicole said. 
</P>
<P>
"Your feet start to hurt," Acacia complained. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the mall they go. They pass a merry-go-round that they are glad 
they have outgrown. They walk through patches of sun beneath a series of 
skylights, past juice bars, cookie and pretzel stands and the Steer Broiler. 
</P>
<P>
They sit for a moment, resting like the grown-ups that surround them. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, now it's somebody else's turn to choose," Acacia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's walk," Jenny decides. 
</P>
<P>
They go back, slower now, to Sweat &amp; Surf. Or is it Pacific Sunrise? There 
are no boys to meet, only more shirts and posters to buy, and so they do. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any money left," Acacia said, signifying, along with weary legs, 
that this Saturday is about over. 
</P>

AIRFIELD TO GET MASTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors Tuesday approved preparation of a $150,000 master plan for 
new development at Brackett Field, a 208-acre county airport for small planes 
in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
However, the plan may not be completed nor options for new construction 
presented to the supervisors until 1991, said Jean Granucci, spokeswoman for 
the county Aviation Division. 
</P>
<P>
The county's first step will be to apply for a Federal Aviation Administration 
Planning Grant, which would pay 90% of the cost of the master plan and an 
environmental report on possible construction. Applicants often wait a year or 
two for grant approval, Granucci said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 of the 25 undeveloped acres at the airfield will probably be reserved 
for new airport-related businesses, she said. Other types of businesses would 
occupy the other 15 acres, most of it near McKinley Avenue, at the airfield's 
southeast entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Brackett Field is next to a $100-million business park that Koll Co. of Los 
Angeles is building on E Street. 
</P>
<P>
The airfield, just north of Bonelli Regional County Park, is one of five small 
airports run by the county. The others are in Compton, El Monte, Pacoima and 
Lancaster.

DUARTE STUDIES FOAM CONTAINER BAN; 
</P>
<P>
FAST-FOOD PACKAGING MADE WITH OZONE-DEPLETING CHEMICALS TARGETED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerns about the environment and the shortage of landfill space have prompted 
the city to consider banning plastic foam containers, primarily in fast-food 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Containers made from polystyrene are a familiar sight at fast-food restaurants 
and in grocery stores. But the substance is non-biodegradable and cannot be 
recycled as easily as paper. 
</P>
<P>
A more urgent problem, according to Terry Fitzgerald, Duarte's environmental 
consultant, is that the most commonly used form of polystyrene is made with 
chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs -- that deteriorate ozone in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer protects the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays. A weakened 
ozone shield would allow more of the radiation to penetrate the atmosphere, 
creating a potential health hazard and threatening the environment with what is 
called the "greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, Berkeley, San Franciso and Los Angeles have banned the 
use of polystyrene made with CFC, targeting restaurants and take-out 
restaurants in particular, Fitzgerald wrote in a report to the council. The Los 
Angeles ban will take effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500 Fines 
</P>
<P>
The Duarte Council last week asked staff to prepare an ordinance similar to the 
Berkeley law, which went into effect on Sept. 1. That ban could result in 
$500-a-day fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
A second Berkeley ordinance, which will take effect in 1990, bans all 
restaurant use of polystyrene containers, regardless of how they were 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
That law encourages merchants to ensure that at least 50% of their take-out or 
prepared fast-food packaging be recyclable, and requires that fast-food 
restaurants provide separate containers for recyclable packages. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to see how their ordinance worked, whether merchants were able to 
get hold of alternatives," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, manufacturers of polystyrene have voluntarily been 
trying to eliminate the use of CFCs, Fitzgerald said. A new form of polystyrene 
that recently became available reduces the threat to the ozone layer by 95% and 
is competitively priced, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paper Alternative 
</P>
<P>
Turning to paper as another alternative would be more expensive and could raise 
consumer prices by 5%, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
But "in terms of landfill costs, it would be a savings to society," said 
Councilman John Fasana, who favors banning all use of polystyrene. A 
comprehensive ban would also make enforcement easier because it is difficult to 
determine which form of polystyrene was made with CFC, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Tery Michaelis, who wants to ban only polystyrene made with CFC, 
said the Berkeley law "seems a bit restrictive to the fast-food places. I'm a 
little sensitive about legislating everything." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said she is researching the alternatives that might become 
available.

ALHAMBRA, SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-year-old legal battle between Alhambra and the Southern Pacific Railroad 
has ended with the city paying the railroad $6.8 million, according to City 
Manager Kevin Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit stems from a joint project between the city, the railroad and the 
state to eliminate grade crossings along Mission Boulevard, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the tracks had been at street level, contributing to traffic 
congestion at crossings. The project called for lowering the tracks 25 to 30 
feet below ground level and building eight bridges to carry traffic over the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The city had proposed the project, completed in 1977 for $19.5 million, mainly 
to ease the city's north-south traffic flow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A dispute began when the railroad asked to be reimbursed for granting the city 
a temporary construction easement and for what it described as decreased 
property values resulting from the project. The railroad asked for $6 million, 
but the city was willing to pay only $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The case, begun with a lawsuit filed in 1980, ended after a monthlong trial in 
July, 1987, when a jury awarded the railroad $6 million plus interest, for a 
total of $9 million. When the city announced that it planned to appeal the 
decision, the railroad agreed to a $6.8-million settlement, which the city paid 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was interested in accepting cash now rather than waiting for a 
period of time," said Anthony Parrille, attorney for the Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co. He said an appeal could have taken several more years. 
</P>
<P>
"The railroad is happy that it got compensation for its property," Parrille 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the long legal battle, the project was worth it, Murphy said. Before it 
was completed, he said, residents traveling from the north end of town to the 
south faced lengthy delays when trains passed. The trains also impeded response 
time of police and fire teams, he said.

MEETING SET ON NEW 'Y' FACILITY IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors instructed the city attorney and city manager 
Tuesday to meet with YMCA and YWCA officials to discuss how the city can help 
them obtain a site for new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition to the directors, the groups asked the city to consider leasing 
city land, "preferably in Central Park." But city officials said Pasadena's 
charter restricts the use of parkland to recreation. The charter says parkland 
"shall not be sold, transferred or used for other purposes, except upon the 
approval of a majority of the voters at an election." 
</P>
<P>
Director John Crowley said the legal obstacles might be overcome if the YMCA 
and YWCA built recreational facilities at a park and ran their social services 
programs elsewhere, or if they found a suitable site on surplus city property 
that is not dedicated to parks. Director Rick Cole expressed reservations about 
providing parkland to agencies that charge membership fees and said, "Any 
project like this should really to go a vote of the people." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Victor Kaleta and City Manager Donald F. McIntyre said they will 
meet with YMCA and YWCA officials to discuss what sort of assistance the city 
can provide. An earlier plan by the YMCA and YWCA to build a joint facility in 
downtown Pasadena failed when the groups were unable to obtain financing.

OUTDOOR-LOVERS DEDICATE OVERLOOK TO 'JOHN MUIR OF THE SANTA MONICAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "John Muir of the Santa Monicas" had some advice for mountain-lovers who 
gathered last week on an Agoura ridge to dedicate a scenic overlook in her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"Grab all you can, as fast as you can," Helen Martin urged. 
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair-bound Martin, 79, was looking beyond her new bronze plaque 
Friday, which was attached to a stone wall next to Mulholland Highway. She was 
gazing down the mountain toward new, custom houses in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive luxury homes are popping up with increasing frequency in the 
250-square-mile Santa Monica mountain range. Each one brings the city closer to 
the countryside that conservationists love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
28 Years of Work 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a retired social worker and the widow of character actor Strother 
Martin, knows that as well as anyone. For 28 years, she worked to protect the 
fragile mountains that look so rugged to flatlanders from the city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Martin was one of the organizers of the first Southern California 
Chapter of the California Native Plant Society. 
</P>
<P>
She later became a director of the Nature Conservancy and joined the board of 
the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District, the scrappy soil 
conservation service that former President Ronald Reagan helped start when he 
owned a ranch in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, she helped create the network of state and federal park sites that are 
spread out over 56,000 acres between the Hollywood Bowl and Ventura County's 
Mugu Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains have changed since 1966, when Martin married and moved to 
Agoura's Malibu Lake in the center of the Santa Monicas. Then, windows and 
doors were left unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an eight-party telephone line, and the electricity went out every time 
it rained," she recalled Friday. "The freeway did not come out here. The 
closest grocery store was at Shoup and Ventura down in Woodland Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Martin admits it was coincidental that she became an environmental activist 
before it was chic to be one. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband was away filming, she made friends with a "crowd of old 
ladies who . . . all had land and all were conscious of the environment," 
Martin said. "Things sort of snowballed. You get involved in one activity, and 
it leads to another." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband often tagged along to Martin's steady stream of parkland study 
sessions and environmental meetings. "Strother was very proud of me. I had no 
connection with the movie business. He appreciated what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
So did the crowd of 75 that gathered Friday at the new Helen Martin Overlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of people like Helen, you see some open hills up here instead of all 
the sides of mountains gone," said Lesley Devine, president of the Topanga-Las 
Virgenes Resource Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, Helen came to our rescue," said Bill Webb, acting 
superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. He told 
the crowd that Martin had information about the Santa Monica Mountains and 
insights about its personalities that were available nowhere else when the 
federal recreation area was being established. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) compared Martin to the 
legendary 19th-Century conservationist credited with saving Yosemite Valley and 
other areas of the Sierras from development. "She's truly the John Muir of the 
Santa Monicas. God may have created these mountains, but Helen Martin gets 
credit for keeping them safe." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the crowd left for a reception down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mosler, a Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy ranger, unbolted the plaque 
from the stone wall and removed it for safe-keeping. It will be coated with an 
anti-graffiti chemical and cemented on the wall with industrial-strength glue, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it vandal-proof," Mosler explained. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains have changed.

MEMORIES OF WAR BRING PEACE AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY BUFF TRACKS WWII FIGHTER PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even after 43 years, an American World War II fighter pilot kept wondering 
about the Japanese plane he shot down near Shanghai in 1945 -- the one that 
flipped on its nose but didn't burn. 
</P>
<P>
Now the former pilot from Pennsylvania thinks he knows, thanks to Henry 
Sakaida. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida believes he has discovered the identity of the Japanese pilot. "The guy 
lived!" Sakaida said when he finally found a big missing piece to his unique 
puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida, who makes a hobby of pairing former combatants in the aerial dogfights 
of World War II, is eagerly awaiting final confirmation that the two men did 
indeed try to kill each other on that fateful January day. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida said he was delighted to take on the seemingly impossible task of 
tracking down the enemy pilot that Edward Bollen of Sewickley, Pa., only 
vaguely remembers shooting. He did so just because Bollen, whom he has never 
met, was curious about his long-ago foe. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida believes the man is Eiji Mitsui of Urawa, Japan, a one-time flying ace 
who not only can't remember the date he was shot down but who has also changed 
his surname. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Unusual Hobby' 
</P>
<P>
Admitting to "a most unusual hobby," Sakaida, a Rosemead nurseryman, has been 
able to identify dozens of World War II combat pilots who played deadly games 
in the skies over Asia and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, one of the opponents was killed in combat or has since died. 
</P>
<P>
But they now see themselves as comrades with common bonds. Like others Sakaida 
has linked, Bollen said he hopes he and Mitsui will someday meet and exchange 
friendly greetings. 
</P>
<P>
This case was particularly knotty for Sakaida, since in his flight report on 
Jan. 14, 1945, Bollen misidentified the type of plane he downed at Hankow 
Airfield. Most Japanese military records were destroyed after the war, Sakaida 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Pilots Recall Incident 
</P>
<P>
But both former pilots recall exactly the same experience at about the same 
time, when the Japanese plane, after it was strafed by Bollen's gunshot, 
flipped over into some grass while trying to make an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida worked on this puzzle for a month, putting pieces together through 
World War II flight reports he got from government archives and through friends 
in Japan who share his interest in history and fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
In many other cases, he said, his research and investigation continued for 
years before he was able to establish combatants' identities. 
</P>
<P>
"That Henry is something else!" Bollen said from his home in Pennsylvania. "I'm 
personally interested in people I've fought against, but I never realized I 
would have the opportunity Henry Sakaida has given me. When he located Mr. 
Mitsui, he was so excited he called me in the middle of the day, and again that 
evening. Henry seems like a real neat guy." 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida, 38, was born in California long after World War II ended and has no 
personal connection with that period, nor is he a flier. During the war, his 
father, John, was assigned to Manzanar, a relocation camp for 
Japanese-Americans. His mother, Tokie, grew up in Japan. The family owns the 
Sakaida Nursery in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World War II Memorabilia 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Rosemead High School and San Jose State University, Sakaida lives 
in Temple City with his wife, Donna, and their two little boys. One room in 
their home is devoted to World War II memorabilia and includes shelves of books 
that fellow history buffs have written and sent him. Sakaida, in turn, has sent 
them copies of his 1983 book, "Winged Samurai," which tells the story of Saburo 
Sakai, a Japanese flying ace. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida said his interest in contacting enemy pilots began in 1975 on a 
vacation in Japan. A former fighter pilot asked Sakaida to help him identify 
the American who had shot him down over Guam in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
"After checking around, I found it wouldn't be that difficult," Sakaida said. 
Although he was unable to determine who the American pilot was, he found 
himself hooked on a hobby that promised great personal satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago he wrote a small newsletter about fighter pilots. Since then, 
most requests for information and research come to him by word of mouth, mostly 
from former pilots who keep in touch with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The reward is the smile on people's faces, you know?" he said. "If I got money 
out of it, that would just kind of ruin it. It's just fun seeing these people 
so happy, especially the ones that meet and shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Sakaida arranged a meeting at his parents' home between Sakai and an 
American adversary, Harold Jones, who battled in 1942 in the skies above 
Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida has discovered that the fighter pilots he has researched have distinct 
traits, among them a total lack of animosity for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"They were technicians -- super soldiers," Sakaida said. "So much training went 
into being a pilot, that was a common bond. They liked to fly, the thrill of 
combat, and now they like to relive the 
</P>
<P>
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a life-and-death game, not like ground action. They were kind of above 
it all. I've never had any problem with hatred -- no animosity on either side. 
They all say war was a tragedy, they just had to do their jobs. Nothing 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
Bollen said: "This was not like the infantry, where you're surrounded by dead 
bodies. Of course, during the war you have a hate on for the enemy because 
they're shooting your buddies. But they weren't necessarily wanting to kill any 
more than we were. And after the war, you wonder what it was all about and wish 
you knew about the ones who were still living. So then you want to meet and 
shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida's explanation for the reason he spends so much time matching up enemies 
who don't know each other -- most of whom he has never met and never will -- 
is: "It's just fun. I like history, and I like to solve mysteries. It's 
fascinating trying to track these people down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bored Staying Home 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't know of any other Americans who provide this kind of 
research as a hobby, although he has some counterparts in Japan. Bollen said he 
knows of no one else who does what Sakaida does. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has devoted most of his research to locating fighter pilots, 
Sakaida has delved into other unsolved mysteries. He does it in his spare time, 
he said, especially when he gets sick and is bored with having to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Stacks of files in his home contain several dozen "cases" he continues to work 
on. He lists about 35 he has completed. They range from the case of a Japanese 
nurse whose pleadings spared the life of a captured American pilot whose 
identity she never knew to that of the widow of a man whose signature was on a 
Japanese battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
Sakaida once worked off and on for four years to identify a New Zealand flier 
who parachuted from his plane and was rescued by Sakaida's friend and neighbor, 
Minoru Fujita of Rosemead, who commanded a Japanese navy gunboat in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita had been haunted by the memory of the injured pilot, who had asked 
Fujita to pray with him. After saying the Lord's Prayer together, the pilot was 
taken to a hospital. In 1987, with Sakaida's help, Fujita learned that the New 
Zealander had died two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found a Pilot's Grave 
</P>
<P>
So important was this information to Fujita that he located the pilot's grave 
in New Caledonia, where he prayed for him again. He also met the victim's 
brother in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 Sakaida bought a World War II-era Japanese life jacket -- standard 
equipment for fliers -- and eight years later found the original owner. The 
Japanese pilot had made a crash-landing near Shanghai, discarded his 
possessions -- including the jacket -- and hid in the mountains for three days 
before being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The life jacket was apparently picked up by a native and ended up in the United 
States, where Sakaida bought it from a collector for $250. In 1987, Sakaida 
delivered the jacket to the flier's commanding officer, who was visiting in Los 
Angeles. The flier and jacket were subsequently reunited. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so happy and overcome, he cried," Sakaida said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really nostalgic. I keep in contact with a lot of people -- buddy-buddies, 
you might say." 
</P>
<P>
Once he found a 1923 yearbook from Polytechnic High School in Long Beach and 
identified the original owner, who he discovered had died in the 1950s. Then he 
picked out the prettiest girl in the graduating class and tracked her down. She 
is an 82-year-old who lives in Newport Beach, "and she was just flabbergasted 
when I called," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sakaida said, his favorite mystery is that of a Japanese combat pilot who 
came upon a lone damaged American Hellcat over the Marshall Islands. The 
Japanese pilot, Isamu Miyazaki, said the American had "such a pitiful 
expression on his face, I didn't have the heart to shoot him down," according 
to Sakaida. 
</P>
<P>
"So now Miyazaki wants to know if the American made it back safely, and if he 
lived," Sakaida said. "This is a good one. I expect to find out."

TEACHING TOURIST; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THIS TRAVELING HIGH SCHOOL ART INSTRUCTOR, HER CLASSROOM IS THE WORLD 
</P>

As Phila McDaniel walked breathlessly from her classroom to the art gallery at 
Gardena High School the other day, she was, as usual, preparing for a trip. 
</P>
<P>
A crumpled note pinned to her gray-and-black-striped vest reminded her of 
things to do, headed by the admonition: "Don't forget briefcase." With her 
overloaded schedule, it's easy to see the need for reminders. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, 57, is an art instructor, intrepid world traveler, tour leader, 
artist, photographer, art gallery curator, art restorer. She is seeking air 
time for a television documentary she directed on her travels in China. She has 
amassed a highly regarded collection of costumes worn by some of China's ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finalist for Award 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, McDaniel also finds time to study for her doctorate and continue work 
on two books she is writing. And for the second consecutive year, McDaniel is 
one of 10 finalists for the annual Bravo Awards for excellence in teaching the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the eye of a storm, the mild-mannered McDaniel remains unfazed amid the 
flurried pace of her life. "I love the drama and the adventure," McDaniel said. 
"I love art, and I just like to go places and to see what I can find out from 
many different standpoints." 
</P>
<P>
An art teacher for 33 years, McDaniel has taught at Gardena High since 1972. 
She is curator of the school's extensive collection of California art, which 
consists of 78 paintings donated to the school since 1919 by Gardena High 
alumni. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 28 years, she has combined teaching with traveling. She instructs 
Gardena students in painting and art history during the school year and, for 
the last 10 summers, has led tours into remote sections of China. Before China 
opened its doors to Western tourists in 1979, she traveled extensively in 
Japan, Greece, India and Nepal. Since then, she has been to China 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever McDaniel goes, interesting things seem to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into a little altercation with a Tibetan warrior last summer, and I'm 
still suffering from the damage he did to my arm," the scholarly looking 
McDaniel said. The warrior was of the fierce Khampa tribe, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As she recalls it, the fracas began when a Tibetan tour guide recommended that 
participants refrain from buying the warrior's goods in the Xigatse Bazaar, an 
outdoor folk market near Mt. Everest, because the items were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remarkable Collection 
</P>
<P>
"The warrior got angry, and he tried to carry our guide away," McDaniel said. 
"Then I tried to rescue the guide. That's when I got hit by the warrior. He 
tore the tendons in my arm and separated the muscle, so my arm is very weak 
now." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel's next voyage was a presumably safer trip to the Wing Luke Asian 
Museum in Seattle, where a major exhibition of her collection of ethnic 
costumes and jewelry, along with her photographs of the Chinese residents who 
made them, recently opened and will be on display through June. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Kit Freudenberg said McDaniel's collection is remarkable 
because of the completeness of the costumes. Few travelers to China see such 
costumes, she said, and it is possible that the Chinese will stop making 
traditional outfits as the country becomes more Westernized. 
</P>
<P>
"People who travel to China usually do not go farther than Beijing or the Stone 
Forest," Freudenberg said. "In 10 years, I'm willing to bet you will not be 
able to find people in China making these kinds of traditional costumes. It's 
important that it be collected and examined." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel is a member of the China Exploration and Research Society, founded by 
a National Geographic Society researcher last year and dedicated to preserving 
the history and culture of China. 
</P>
<P>
Her research specialty is documenting the customs of China's 55 ethnic minority 
groups. So far, she has collected material from 40 of the groups, including 
members of the Miao, Dong, Tibetan and Manchurian minorities. Like the 
costumes, ethnic customs may be about to vanish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to document things before they disappear," McDaniel said. "It's 
an urgent thing, because once these people get Western civilization, once they 
get television, once they know what's out there in the rest of the world, 
they're going to change. . . . So we have to document things now while they 
still exist in their pure state." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel speaks some Chinese. "Enough to get out of trouble when I'm lost," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have very good relations with the Chinese tourist bureaus. They know I'm a 
serious researcher and not just frivolous. I take people on my tours who like 
what I like -- art, and focusing on the unique qualities of China's ethnic 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, McDaniel traced the path of Mao Tse-tung's Long March across China in 
1934, traveling 900 miles by bus along the dusty roads crossing the Aba 
grasslands. The seven-day feat was celebrated by the governors of the Sichuan 
and Ganshu provinces, each of whom greeted her tour group with banquets and 
ceremonial white scarfs called khagatas that were draped around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how she does it," Freudenberg said. "She was one of the first 
people back in after China opened up, and she is frequently one of the first 
Westerners to go into many regions. She has made friends and acquaintances of 
governors and business managers. Many times her (tour) bus goes where there 
isn't even a road." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling where there was no road and no good gasoline once presented a problem 
when a tour bus broke down in the Yunan grasslands "hundreds of miles from 
civilization," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a bottle of alcohol in my suitcase and I poured it in the carburetor, so 
we could mix the water that was in gasoline better," McDaniel said. "We limped 
along until we found some Tibetans who had a wrench so we could take off the 
gas tank and clean it. Then I strained the gasoline through my T-shirt so we 
could get the water and dirt out. It was because I knew a little bit about 
chemistry and mechanics that I knew what to do." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel picked up some of her knowledge of chemistry from her husband, Calvin, 
a retired Harbor College chemistry professor who is also a tour director, and 
from her father, a mechanic and inventor. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who live in Rancho Palos Verdes, have three adult children, all of 
whom have traveled to China with their mother. Calvin McDaniel, however, said 
he has never been to China. He specializes in tours to the Philippines, Taiwan, 
Malaysia, India and Burma. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles native and an only child, McDaniel said her love of travel and 
teaching came in great part from her mother, an elementary school teacher who 
bought her daughter lavish art and travel books. As an undergraduate, McDaniel 
studied fine arts at Pepperdine University before receiving a master's degree 
in Oriental art history from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel is one of 97 people nominated this year for the seventh annual Bravo 
awards. Two winners will be announced March 6 at a ceremony at the Los Angeles 
County Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, she said. The awards, 
coordinated by the Music Center's education division and sponsored by the 
Jeffrey Melamed Memorial Fund, are given to teachers in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Trudeau, program administrator of the education division, said McDaniel 
is remarkable as a teacher because of her success in inspiring Gardena students 
in arts careers while doubling as curator of the school's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exceptional to run a museum in a high school, and the community is 
proud of it," Trudeau said. "McDaniel is also helping her students in practical 
terms, and is able to help them get the portfolios organized. Many of her past 
students have been very successful in the arts. It's remarkable that she is 
able to do all the activities that she does." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena High Principal Tamotsu Ikeda agrees. "Because of her travels, she 
brings to our kids a world of knowledge which other art teachers would find 
difficult to give to youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
On her return from Seattle, McDaniel's whirlwind schedule will continue. Her 
current exhibit at the high school's art gallery is in celebration of the 
Chinese New Year, which begins Monday. She is organizing a mural to be painted 
by beginning art students in honor of Black History Month, also this month. 
</P>
<P>
Some of McDaniel's former students have returned to exhibit their work in the 
school's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest thrill," McDaniel said, "has been to see some of the result of my 
philosophy of teaching . . . to let children know the joy of creating art."

SEBEK FIGURES TO REMEMBER HIS 53 IN '64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Sebek speaks from experience when he talks to his Nordhoff High boys' 
basketball players about what it takes to score points. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Sebek scored 53 points to set a single-game scoring record at 
Westchester (Ill.) High. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Westchester's graduates, including Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons, 
have had high-scoring games, but nothing that can top Sebek's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Pingatore was an assistant when Sebek played varsity basketball at 
Westchester and has been the head coach at the school for the past 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick was an outstanding scorer," Pingatore said. "He wasn't very tall when he 
first started playing so he needed to develop the skills of the guards. When he 
was senior, he grew to 6-6 and he didn't have any trouble driving by other tall 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Sebek was a member of the first graduating class at Westchester and was an 
all-area selection. He continued his basketball career at Loyola Marymount and 
was a teammate of Rick Adelman, who later played with the Chicago Bulls and 
Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Pingatore has coached 7 players who were selected all-state, including Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Nine graduates are currently playing in Division I and one, Daryl Thomas, is 
playing basketball in Europe. But Pingatore still considers Sebek among his 
best players. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get much recognition because we were a new school," Pingatore said. 
"He made the all-area team, but he probably deserved to be named all-state. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was more consistent shooting 12-foot jump shots, I think he could have 
made the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
End of a streak: Santa Clara's Southern Section record for most consecutive 
league victories is expected to be broken this week by Banning. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, under Coach Lou Cvijanovich, won 82 consecutive league games during 
the 1956 through 1965 seasons to set the record. 
</P>
<P>
Banning won its 81st game Friday at Notre Dame of Riverside. The Broncos played 
Yucaipa Wednesday at home in attempt to tie the record. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care whether the record is broken or not," said Cvijanovich, whose 
current team has won 40 consecutive Frontier League games. "I'm not an egotist. 
I'm here to teach the players how to play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
End of streak II: Santa Paula snapped a 13-game losing streak with a 82-39 
victory over Villanova Prep on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The winning steak, however, was short-lived as the Cardinals dropped their next 
3 contests and have fallen to 1-16 overall and 0-6 in Frontier League play 
under first-year coach Matt Micek. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt is an excellent coach, but he's having his troubles," said Henry Jacinto, 
the Santa Paula athletic director. "People have been ragging him for having a 
losing program, but it's not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have a senior that has ever played a lick of varsity basketball 
before this year and he doesn't have one 6-footer." 
</P>
<P>
Winning can be simple: Another coach who is new to his school, Roy Gilmore of 
Ventura, has found success since simplifying his system. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura won 3 consecutive games since Gilmore went to a 2-3 zone defense and a 
power-type offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting the ball inside more to our big players and that has really 
opened up the outside shot," Gilmore said. "Nate (Hantgin) had two of his best 
games of the season last week." 
</P>
<P>
Hantgin scored 21 points against San Marcos and a season-high 25 points against 
Hueneme. The senior is as equally adept at 3-point shots (47%) as from 2-point 
(46%) range. 
</P>
<P>
More long-range marksmen: St. Bonaventure made more 3-point field goals than 
2-point shots in consecutive games last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Seraphs made 10 3-pointers and 6 2-pointers against Carpinteria and 12 
3-pointers and 11 2-pointers against Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
All 5 of Cliff Feldheim's field goals were 3-pointers against Moorpark. 
Feldheim, who leads the team with a 12.4 scoring average, also made 6 of 7 free 
throws to finish with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Wednesday's games, the defending Tri-Valley League champion Seraphs 
are 13-5 overall and 6-0 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Time is now: Coach Gary Anglin appreciates the sentiment, but he is tired of 
hearing how good his Ventura College baseball team is supposed to be next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to wait for next year to be good," he said. "We want to do it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Anglin, in his 12th year with the Pirates, expects his pitching staff to make 
Ventura a contender in the Western State Conference. Ventura was 24-12 last 
season and finished second in the WSC Northern Division behind Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates missed a playoff berth after losing a doubleheader to Bakersfield 
College on the last day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who play host to Mission College in their season opener Friday, 
have 4 starters returning from last year's lineup -- outfielders Chris Ames and 
Brent Cookson, the 1987 Ventura County Player of the Year; catcher Tom Couture 
and designated hitter Mike Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Shane Espitia, who was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers 
out of Ventura High, leads a pitching staff of predominantly freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Derron Spiller of Rio Mesa was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Dean McMillin of Ventura was drafted by the Kansas City Royals and right-hander 
Mike Teron of Santa Clara was drafted by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little apprehensive because we're so young," Anglin said. "We could 
potentially start 7 out of 9 freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Under Anglin, who has a 191-175 record, the Pirates are 65-42 over the last 3 
seasons. Twelve Pirate players have signed pro contracts over the past 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Close calls: The Moorpark College men's basketball team allows 68 points a game 
to lead the WSC in defense. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, however, the Raiders only average 70.8 points, which may explain 
why Moorpark is involved in so many 2-point games. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark was 14-10, 5-3 in conference play and in third place in the WSC 
Northern Division entering this week's games.

FIRST-PLACE CAL POLY WOMEN WILL FACE TOUGH TESTS AGAINST NORTHRIDGE, CSLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-place Cal Poly Pomona has been impressive in building a 4-0 record in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in women's basketball, but the Broncos 
have their toughest games ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, 15-4 overall and ranked No. 2 nationally in NCAA Division II, must 
visit 16th-ranked Cal State Northridge at 5:45 tonight and Cal State Los 
Angeles at 8:05 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge entered this week at 15-4 overall and 3-1 in the CCAA. Cal State 
L.A., which has won six of its last seven games, is 12-8 and 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
After watching her team roll over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 99-72, last week, 
Pomona Coach Darlene May says her team is starting to play at the level she had 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, I was pleased with the way we played against Cal Poly SLO," 
May said. "Both of our freshmen, (forward) Tami Chick and (guard) Yvette Hill, 
are providing us some solid play and making us a better all-around team. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge and Los Angeles are solid teams that will challenge us for the CCAA 
title. This week should tell us where we are with them." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which has won the conference title seven straight years, has been led 
by its All-CCAA tandem of junior center Niki Bracken (6-2) and senior point 
guard Cathy Gooden (5-5). Bracken is averaging 18.4 points and 8.6 rebounds and 
Gooden 14.9 points and 5.6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos also start forwards Susan Luckinbill (5-9) and Stephanie Coons 
(5-10) and guard Carrie Egan (5-8). 
</P>
<P>
They will face a Northridge team that has three players scoring in double 
figures, including center Chris Cavalin (5-10), who averages a team-high 16.6 
points and 10.1 rebounds. The others are forwards Julie Arlotto (5-11) at 12.2 
points and Bridgette Ealy (5-8) at 11.7. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Broncos will meet a team playing particularly well since 
the start of January. Coach Fran Buckless said part of the reason for her 
team's resurgence has been the addition of 6-0 forwards Trisha Maly, who 
transferred from Pepperdine University, and Tina Slatinsky, who missed the 
early portion of the schedule after an appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
Maly has averaged 13.9 points and has made 59% of her field-goal attempts and 
90% of her free throws. Slatinsky is averaging 11.5 points and 6.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The leader for the Golden Eagles has been senior center Lupe Quintana (6-0), 
averaging 14.7 points and 10.2 rebounds. She is the all-time CCAA leader in 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Before facing Pomona, the Golden Eagles will entertain UC Riverside in a 
conference game at 5:45 tonight.

MANY TOP FOOTBALL PROSPECTS UNDECIDED; 
</P>
<P>
BUT 2 OF THE BEST LINEMEN WILL BE TROJANS; HUSKERS GET DARYL GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the red-letter day of Feb. 8 approaching -- that is, the first day prep 
football players can sign a national letter of intent to attend a four-year 
NCAA college -- many top prospects have yet to decide. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the case with three players considered by scouts as the top 
prospects in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive linemen Terry McDaniels of Pasadena and Len Gorecki of Damien and 
defensive back Daryl Green of Nogales have made verbal commitments, two of them 
to the same school. McDaniels, 6-6 and 250 pounds, and Gorecki, 6-6 and 271, 
have opted for USC while Green, 5-11 and 180, has chosen Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
All admit relief that letters and phone calls from recruiters are behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy now," Green said. "I'm glad it's all over and I just can't wait to 
put my name on (the letter of intent). I'll be happy after that." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people said take all of your trips before you commit," Gorecki added. 
"But I'm glad I didn't. I've been getting back to my studies. I let my grades 
slip, and now I'm studying again." 
</P>
<P>
For McDaniels, the recruiting process is not entirely over. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has already announced intention to attend USC, Pacific 10 
Conference rival Arizona still wants McDaniels to take a recruiting trip to the 
Tucson school. McDaniels, an excellent student, will take his final exams at 
Pasadena this week and leave for Arizona on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"They were recruiting me all along and told me to come down anyway," McDaniels 
said. "With my finals ending Thursday, it won't take up my studying time to go 
there Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is looking forward to visiting Arizona, he added that it will 
probably not change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to blow my mind to make me change because I'm happy with USC," 
McDaniels said. "It's close to home and I like their history department. I'm 
very curious about Arizona, though." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels, who visited UCLA and Washington and canceled a recruiting trip to UC 
Berkeley, said that at every school "I went there was a nice family atmosphere. 
I feel that I could have fit in anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But he settled on USC because of its football tradition and the fact that it is 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels, who combines with 4.7-second speed in the 40-yard dash, said USC 
coaches gave him the option of playing offense or defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They said my skills were so good on both sides that I could play anywhere," he 
said. "I'm leaning toward defense because I like that a little better." 
</P>
<P>
He said the coaches didn't make him promises but, after looking at the Trojan 
depth chart, he thinks he could see playing time next season. "It's all 
academic, anyway," McDaniels said. "I still have to earn my position." 
</P>
<P>
Gorecki said that since USC started recruiting him, he wanted to play for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I wanted to do because they have the best offensive line 
tradition, no question," Gorecki said." 
</P>
<P>
Gorecki's biggest concern was that he wouldn't be offered a scholarship by the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
While he was on his recruiting trip to USC two weeks ago, Gorecki was the 
victim of a practical joke by another recruit who told him that he had accepted 
the Trojans' last available scholarship on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"When he told me that I almost had tears in my eyes," Gorecki recalled. "I 
didn't know he was only joking." 
</P>
<P>
He felt a lot better a little later after a discussion with Coach Larry Smith 
revealed that there was another scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Before his visit to USC, Gorecki also took recruiting trips to Washington State 
and Colorado and canceled a visit to UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He said his trip to Washington State may have been a case of bad timing: "I 
liked Washington State, but I happened to be there when they had their worst 
weather conditions. It was 10 below zero." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the weather that turned him off of Colorado: "I liked Colorado, but I 
didn't like the wishbone. I'm not a wishbone blocker." 
</P>
<P>
He said his biggest concern about USC centered around how soon he would play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about SC's depth, but found out they weren't as deep as I 
thought," Gorecki said. "At first, I didn't know whether I could cut it 
depthwise. But after talking with the coaches after I committed, they showed me 
the depth chart. I feel I can compete for a starting position in another two 
seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike McDaniels and Gorecki, Green wasn't persuaded to attend Nebraska after 
his recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Green committed with the Cornhuskers before he had visited the campus 
in Lincoln. "After a while of being recruited, that's where I knew I wanted to 
go," he said. "I didn't think I needed to visit." 
</P>
<P>
Green wondered whether he was making the right decision, but after visiting 
Nebraska he was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"It pretty much sewed it up for me," he said. "Nebraska is football country. 
Everywhere you go there are football fans. Everyone seemed to know about me. 
Even when I was on the plane (to Lincoln), people were telling me to go to 
Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
He said the clincher was being greeted at the airport by Cornhusker quarterback 
Steve Taylor, lineman Broderick Thomas and running back Terry Rodgers. "They 
gave me the feeling that they really wanted me," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Green, an All-CIF running back who rushed for 1,414 yards and 11 touchdowns as 
a senior and 3,436 yards in three years at Nogales, had also visited Syracuse 
and Washington. But he says he will switch to defensive back at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I can play anywhere, but I told them I want to play defensive 
back," he said. "They lost a lot of defensive backs and I may get more of a 
chance to play (as a freshman)." 
</P>
<P>
The only stumbling block for Green may be his Scholastic Aptitude Test. Green 
scored a 660 -- 40 points less than the minimum NCAA standard for eligibility 
-- on his first try but is confident that he will make it when he takes it 
again Saturday or at a later testing date. 
</P>
<P>
He said Nebraska will hold a scholarship for him until June. He even has a 
roommate in Servite running back Derek Brown, who has committed with the 
Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
Green, McDaniels and Gorecki are among 18 valley high school seniors who have 
attracted considerable interest from major colleges, and most have yet to 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
Where other prospects are leaning: 
</P>
<P>
* Jason Martin (Los Altos, tight end-defensive back) -- There is little 
question about the ability of Martin in the eyes of recruiters. The only 
question is where he will play and what position. In earning co-Player of the 
Year honors in Division IV, the 6-4 and 205 Martin starred at tight end and 
safety. He has visited Syracuse, Arizona State and Utah. Syracuse is recruiting 
him as a tight end, Utah at U-back and Arizona State as a strong safety or 
all-around athlete. Arizona State may have the edge. 
</P>
<P>
* Wolfe Payne Barber (Rosemead, defensive back-running back) -- Can play 
offense or defense. He has been recruited mostly as a defensive back, but the 
6-0 and 183 speedster piled up 2,300 all-purpose yards on offense as a senior. 
The all-CIF performer has visited Oregon and Hawaii and will make a trip to USC 
before deciding. Syracuse is also among the leading contenders. But USC may be 
the leader, especially since brother Kurt Barber is a linebacker for the 
Trojans. He is awaiting the results of his SAT. 
</P>
<P>
* Darick Holmes (Muir, wide receiver) -- One of the better all-around athletes 
in the valley, Holmes played quarterback and defensive back as a senior after 
starting at wide receiver as a junior. The 6-1, 185-pound runner rushed for 
1,315 yards and 23 touchdowns and passed for 881 yards as a senior, but 
recruiters appear to prefer his talents as a wide receiver. He is being 
recruited by Colorado, Brigham Young and Miami -- all as a wide receiver. 
Talent aside, the biggest question appears to be his SAT score. 
</P>
<P>
* Mumbie Mushonga (Muir, linebacker) -- As a senior with the Mustangs, Mushonga 
did not receive as much attention from opponents as Holmes, but scouts have 
noticed. At 6-3 and 215, he was Muir's leading tackler last season and is 
penciled in as either an inside or outside linebacker in college. Mushonga has 
visited New Mexico and UC Berkeley and has also been recruited strongly by 
Brigham Young. New Mexico appears to be the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
* J.J. McGwire (Claremont, defensive tackle) -- The youngest of the McGwire 
brothers, J. J. has followed in the family's strong athletic tradition. His 
brother Mark stars as a first baseman for the Oakland A's and Dan will be a 
junior quarterback at San Diego State next season. Scouts see 6-3 and 235 J. J. 
as a defensive lineman -- either at tackle or nose guard. He has visited San 
Diego State, Oregon and Oregon State, but it would be a surprise if he didn't 
join Dan with the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
* Kenny Hall (Garey, offensive tackle) -- A star on both sides of the interior 
line, Hall appears to be ticketed to be an offensive tackle in college. At 6-5 
and 270, he certainly has the size recruiters like and is a good blocker for 
running and passing. He has taken his only visit to Fresno State, but Oregon 
State and Arizona are interested.

GIVING RISE TO FRESH IDEAS; 
</P>
<P>
BAKERY GIVES ITS PATRONS A TASTE OF CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walk into City Bakery for a loaf of rye and you might stagger out with a 
sackful of metaphor and a half-baked ballad. 
</P>
<P>
Poets read their hearts out there one night a month. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday mornings, owner George Keenen, a writer toiling over a children's 
version of the Odyssey, which he once translated from the ancient Greek, tells 
stories to saucer-eyed preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, folk singers wail in the old printing plant in mid-town 
Ventura, and a group of Ventura County Medical Center doctors, under the name 
"Malpractice," delivers bluegrass classics. The Plexus Dance Company plans to 
stage a performance there, tripping lightly on the linoleum between the muffin 
counters and the folding metal tables. And Keenen wants to play host to a 
marathon reading of James Joyce's "Ulysses" on June 16, the 85th anniversary of 
the day Joyce chose to have his characters plod around Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
The place is more than a cup of coffee and a good dunk. It's a free-form, 
come-as-you-are literary salon, concert hall, community center and oat-bran 
extravaganza. If it were broadcast, it would be the Ventura Home Companion. If 
it were simmered, it would be a jambalaya. In a day of bottom lines, it's 
vertical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very enthusiastic about it," said Ventura real estate agent Judy Hower, a 
regular at the bakery's Thursday night "Pizza 'n' Pictionary" bouts. "They've 
got something for the intellectual, for the children on Saturday mornings, for 
families. This is the best thing that's happened to this town in years." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ron Blanchette, a Ventura psychoanalyst who reads his poetry and takes his 
ease there, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meant a great deal to me," said Blanchette, who specializes in treating 
other therapists. "A lot of people in Ventura feel deprived because, in some 
ways, the city is an intellectual desert. The bakery has succeeded in bringing 
them together for a wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
That's lavish praise for a place that broke no new ground in corporate planning 
when it opened eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a cash register," Keenen said. "Overnight, we hid cash in a 
plastic tray in the oven, but one morning forgot to take it out before we 
turned the oven on." 
</P>
<P>
Employees were drawn from a crew of willing customers. "One kid from Humboldt 
State came in and said he'd never made a cheesecake," Keenen said. "We put him 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
Keenen had no experience in the bakery business, but picked up some tips during 
a week as a hanger-on at the Tassajara Zen bakery in San Francisco. A former ad 
man, children's author, horse rancher and VISTA volunteer, he quit his job as 
copy chief at Sage Publishing, a Newbury Park company that puts out social 
science texts and periodicals. Mabel Chase, creator of most of the bakery's 
recipes, left her job as a child nutritionist for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Why abandon career and paycheck for 14-hour days and a crust of pumpernickel? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it had to do with the oven, and Mabel is an excellent cook," Keenen 
said, widening his eyes and inserting spaces between words in the manner of a 
man accustomed to earning the attention of 4-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
While cleaning out a carpet store in Bakersfield, an acquaintance had 
discovered a massive oven, an inoperable relic left over from the building's 
days as a House of Pies. 
</P>
<P>
The couple got it for a song and spent four months overhauling it. "It was like 
restoring a steam locomotive," Keenen said. "We had $90-an-hour specialists 
coming up from Pasadena to look over its bearings." 
</P>
<P>
When the gleaming monolith finally came to life, they crawled inside and rode 
around on the revolving trays, hoisting glasses of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Not every day is so jubilant at City Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"Another November," said a sighing Summer Nicol, reciting a poem Friday night 
about the death of her cat. "The first tear of the evening drips down my right 
cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Over three hours, a dozen poets trooped to the microphone one by one, nervously 
issuing laments, odes, manifestoes, confessionals and what-have-you, mainly 
unrhymed and mostly doleful. They wrote of faded love, raging consciousness, 
the ocean, entropy, suffering, death in myriad forms, loneliness, confusion, 
truth and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
But the packed-house crowd didn't call for limericks. Polite applause followed 
each offering, and Keenen himself got a big hand for a bakery-based ballad 
called "Chocolate Wedding Cake": 
</P>
<P>
 A woman came in around Christmas 
</P>
<P>
 a sad face, a gray overcoat. 
</P>
<P>
 married seven days A wreck from telling no one And she wanted a chocolate 
wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
 City Bakery built one four layers high 
</P>
<P>
 each layer golden from the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 But when City Bakery applied the icing 
</P>
<P>
 the layers began to slip 
</P>
<P>
 like tectonic plates 
</P>
<P>
 and the cake became a chocolate Australia 
</P>
<P>
 then the chocolate ruins of Dresden 
</P>
<P>
 then a chocolate igloo, a chocolate Eichmann trial, 
</P>
<P>
 a chocolate meadow muffin. ... 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, City Bakery propped 
</P>
<P>
 with curls of white chocolate 
</P>
<P>
 lifting it into a chocolate road apple 
</P>
<P>
 a chocolate speed bump, a chocolate burial mound ... 
</P>
<P>
 City Bakery brings the cake slash thing out in a box. 
</P>
<P>
 City Bakery lifts the lid 
</P>
<P>
 and four City Bakery aprons 
</P>
<P>
 form a City Bakery rescue choir 
</P>
<P>
 and sing: ooouuuuu woooooow, that is the most beautiful 
</P>
<P>
 will you look at what a marvelous isn't it wonderful! 
</P>
<P>
 She breathes -- is about to speak 
</P>
<P>
 then she looks at the cake again and sees that it IS beautiful 
</P>
<P>
 and smiles, and thanks us, 
</P>
<P>
 and carts the thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how chocolate wedding cake came to mean 
</P>
<P>
 something small that's been rescued by love. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Keenen arrived at the bakery at 6. He cleaned up from the 
night before, helped prepare the day's scones and breads, and greeted early 
arrivals. Then, at 10 a.m., right on schedule, he sat before a band of 
fidgeting toddlers and, widening his eyes and inserting spaces between his 
words, intoned: 
</P>
<P>
"This is a story about a genie and a lamp, and a very wise fisherman. . . . "

PITCHING A PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
NEW WAVE COACH TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME FILLING HOLE ON MOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before he sat down for an interview at Pepperdine's Eddy D. Field Stadium, 
first-year baseball Coach Andy Lopez had been working hard with a rake and 
shovel, trying to get the diamond ready for the season. 
</P>
<P>
He was not attempting to repair the big hole in his pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
No tools could fill the gap left by the departure of the Waves' two best 
pitchers from last year: senior Doug Simons and sophomore Dennis Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Simons was a ninth-round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins. Burbank is pitching 
for Cypress Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had a combined record of 22-5, and Simons pitched 130 innings and 
Burbank 91. They were a big reason why the Waves won another West Coast 
Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the finals of the NCAA West II 
Regional before losing a doubleheader to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gorrie, Pepperdine's coach for 10 years, retired after last season and was 
hoping that Burbank, who last year was 11-2 with a 3.75 earned-run average, 
would be the strong man of the pitching staff this season. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank came to Pepperdine on a basketball scholarship, but he played little 
basketball last year, quit the team and lost his scholarship. After he switched 
to baseball and began to pitch well, he asked Gorrie for a full baseball 
scholarship for his sophomore year. Gorrie tried to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was that many of Gorrie's players were on partial scholarships, and 
he had to do fancy juggling to come up with a full ride for Burbank. But he 
eventually did so, only to learn that Burbank had decided to leave Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank said that Gorrie and the athletic department offered him the 
scholarship right after the end of last season and that he did not think that 
was soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the commitment earlier," Burbank said. "I was willing to make the 
commitment, but they were not. To come up with the money on the very last day, 
when my car was packed, it was too late then." 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie, still a member of the physical education faculty, said of his dealings 
with Burbank: "Whatever promises were made were kept. (The scholarship) would 
have come earlier if it had been available." 
</P>
<P>
When Lopez, 34, took over, he tried to get Burbank to reconsider, but Burbank 
said, "I decided against it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that although Lopez and his assistant, Bill Springman, had been "real 
good about it," he decided to stick with his decision to attend Cypress. He 
said he may have been influenced because he could sign with a major league team 
after only a season at Cypress. If he had stayed at Pepperdine or transferred 
to another NCAA Division I school, he would have had to wait until after his 
junior year under NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to sign if the money is there," he said, "but Cypress has got the 
best program in the area. Cypress has a fantastic team this year." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who came to Pepperdine after six successful seasons as head coach at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, would like to have a fantastic team this season at 
Pepperdine. He may yet have one, but the loss of Burbank isn't his only 
pitching problem. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores Craig Stiveson and Scott Singelyn will not pitch this season. 
Stiveson, who missed last season with tendinitis in his arm, has not recovered 
from shoulder surgery. Singelyn, who dropped out of school last winter after 
eligibility problems, is back in school but is again ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will rely on four junior pitchers who did not see much action last year: 
Britt Craven, Wayne Helm, Randy Hacker and Kipp Landis. Left-hander John 
Kuzmic, a transfer from Orange Coast Junior College and the only recruit of 
Lopez, is expected to help. 
</P>
<P>
Craven was 5-3 with a 5.26 ERA, Helm 4-2 and 2.92, Hacker 1-1 and 4.49 and 
Landis 3-3 and 5.84. Helm is coming off elbow surgery that cut last season 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The news is not all bad. Lopez has 15 lettermen, led by four all-conference 
selections: senior center fielder Rick Hirtensteiner, senior first baseman 
Scott Shockey, Craven and junior shortstop Chris Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner, a first-team selection with Shockey, led the Waves with a .337 
batting average and stole 18 bases. Shockey batted .303 with team-high marks of 
nine home runs and 54 runs batted in. Martin, named to the second team with 
Craven, hit .319. 
</P>
<P>
In the preseason rankings of Collegiate Baseball, Pepperdine was No. 17, ahead 
of No. 24 Loyola Marymount and No. 29 Santa Clara. Santa Clara finished in 
second place in the conference last year behind Pepperdine and Loyola was 
third. All went to the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a UCLA infielder who was a ninth-round draft choice of the Detroit 
Tigers in 1975, has faced more difficult problems than how to get through a 
season without as much pitching as he'd like. 
</P>
<P>
He had to decide between baseball and education when he was drafted by the 
Tigers. He chose education, graduating from UCLA and obtaining a master's 
degree in educational administration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, when he was 22, he became a teacher and baseball coach at Mira Costa 
High School, where he spent five seasons, taking the Mustangs to the 
CIF-Southern Section final in 1982. Then he was offered the head coaching job 
at Dominguez Hills, an offer he first rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he was studying for the ministry 
</P>
<P>
and had decided to coach an Athletes in Action team on a two-year playing tour 
of the Orient. When he turned down the job at Dominguez Hills, he at first told 
himself, "You really messed up, Andy." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be involved with athletes in a religious capacity," he said. Then 
his pastor told him that he thought coaching athletics was a ministry, and 
Lopez decided that his pastor was right. He called Dominguez Hills and was 
given the job. 
</P>
<P>
His Toros won California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships in 1986 and 
1987 and advanced to the Division II College World Series in '87. He was named 
Division II West Region coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He said his first year at Dominguez Hills was toughest. "The team hadn't won a 
lot of games (the year before), and it was a year of learning while the players 
had to get used to me." 
</P>
<P>
He expects a period of adjustment at Pepperdine. "Just the state of change is 
difficult, no matter whom you take over for. But (Athletic Director) Wayne 
Wright and the administration have made me feel very comfortable here. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little added pressure here (because) I am taking over a program that 
has been very successful." 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be nice if he could emulate Gorrie, who took the Waves to the 
Division I World Series in 1979, his first year at Pepperdine. "But I'm not 
going to revolutionize Pepperdine baseball. At the end of the year, I may sit 
back and wonder about what might have been. Or there could be some real 
surprises and some big smiles at the opportunity to make it with a Division I 
team."

TALENTED BRUIN TRACK TEAM LOSES THREE KEY ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For a while, it looked as if the UCLA track and field team was on its way to 
establishing a mini-dynasty. The Bruins won their second consecutive national 
title in June and prospective members of this year's team scored 65 points for 
that championship. 
</P>
<P>
But before the their first meet of the season, the Bruins have lost three key 
members, jeopardizing a third consecutive national title. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Everett, who took the bronze medal in the Seoul Olympics in 400 meters 
and was a member of the gold medal 1,600 relay team, has decided to forgo his 
senior year to pursue commercial endorsements. Everett would have been 
defending his NCAA title in the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"Track's different from football and basketball, where there's money to be made 
every year," Coach Bob Larsen said about Everett. "In track, you have to be 
ready to take it while it's there, like a year after the Olympics. . . . We've 
always felt that it's important to do what's best for the individual, and this 
is a one-time opportunity for Danny." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will also be without sprinter Henry Thomas and thrower Kamy 
Keshmiri. Thomas, who placed third at the NCAA meet in 200 meters and was a 
member of the record-setting 1,600 meter relay team, is redshirting this season 
and will compete unattached. Thomas had earlier said that he wanted to play 
football but, according to Larsen, now plans to concentrate on track. 
</P>
<P>
Keshmiri, the 1988 Gatorade prep track and field Athlete of the Year, has 
withdrawn from school and returned home to Reno, Larsen said. Keshmiri 
redshirted last season while recovering from an injury. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA still has 38 points returning from the championship meet. Expected to lead 
the Bruins are sophomore Steve Lewis, the Olympic gold medalist in 400 meters, 
and senior Mike Marsh, an alternate on the U.S. 400 meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA should also receive a boost from football player Kevin Williams, who will 
run track before and after spring football practice. Williams, one of the most 
highly recruited running backs in the nation last year, redshirted as a 
freshman and has a personal best of 21.09 in 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"This looked like it was going to be our best team ever," said Larsen, who 
expects UCLA toughest competition to come from the universities of Texas and 
Florida. "Now, we're going to have to really work for it. It's going to be much 
more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
With Feb. 8 the first day that high school seniors can sign letters of intent 
with universities, the UCLA football team appears headed for another top 
recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have received verbal commitments from Patrick Bates, a 6-5, 
210-pound defensive back from Galveston, Tex.; Matt Werner, a 6-5, 245-pound 
defensive lineman from Anaheim, and Derek Stevens, a 6-4, 255-pound offensive 
lineman from Bakersfield, according to Allan Wallace, editor of SuperPrep 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, one of the most highly touted defensive backs in the nation, chose the 
Bruins over Nebraska, Michigan and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, named to the SuperPrep All-Far West team, had originally committed to 
USC, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
Werner chose the Bruins over Cal and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Other top recruits who have given the Bruins commitments: 
</P>
<P>
* Quarterback Bert Emanuel (6-1, 175), Houston. 
</P>
<P>
* Quarterback Tommy Maddox (6-5, 200), Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
* Defensive back Robert Gamble (5-10, 175), Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
* Defensive back Garrett Greedy (6-3, 220), Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
* Tight end Brian Allen (6-4, 215), Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
* Linebacker Carrick O'Quinn (6-3, 225), Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
* Wide receiver Michael Moore (6-4, 190), Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* Defensive back Travis Collier (6-3, 195), Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Brown, an All-Camino Real League defensive back for St. Bernard High 
School, has committed to UC Berkeley, according to St. Bernard Coach Duke 
Dulgarian. Brown was also recruited by UCLA, Penn State and Notre Dame, 
Dulgarian said.

HIS VICTORY HERE LAST YEAR ENDED 10-YEAR STRUGGLE

<P>
For every pro who is eminently successful on the PGA Tour there are countless 
others who are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Some pack it in, reasoning that the mental strain and frustration are not 
proper rewards for pursuing a goal that seems tantalizingly out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Chip Beck was one of the strugglers. It was his 11th year as a pro, 
and even though he had been rewarded financially at times, he had yet to win a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Then he broke through at the Nissan Los Angeles Open at Riviera Country Club, 
where he won his first tour event. 
</P>
<P>
The victory so boosted his self-esteem and confidence that he went on to win 
another tournament, the USF&amp;G Classic, and earn $916,818 for the year, 
second only to Curtis Strange's record $1,144,677. 
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion in the L.A. Open, beginning today at Riviera, Beck 
obviously has fond memories of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad (the first win) came at this particular course because of the history 
here," Beck said. "You feel you're competing with the past. It was one of Ben 
Hogan's favorite tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"The course hasn't changed a whole lot and that's always nice. There aren't 
many golf courses where you can say Hogan did things on such and such a hole. 
The course has always produced great champions. It's a wonderful feeling to 
have my first defense here." 
</P>
<P>
For the North Carolina-born Beck, the struggle has been worth it, but the 
agonizing memories of other years are still with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through every range of emotional turmoil you can imagine," said Beck of 
his 10 winless years. "There's doubt and you question every part of your fiber 
and you struggle with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Beck seriously considered quitting the Tour at the end of the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't producing," he said. "It seemed pretty futile for me to be 
playing golf just for a living. So I gave myself 2 more years. I showed some 
promise and I'm glad it came through for me because I love playing golf." 
</P>
<P>
The strain of persevering on the tour also had taken its toll on his personal 
life, resulting in a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"The life style is difficult," he said. "It's not easy being married to a 
struggling golfer. It's not easy being married to a pro period. It takes a lot 
of bending on both parties." 
</P>
<P>
Even though one would assume that there's pressure on a defending champion, 
Beck regards his status as a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you start 1-up in a lot of ways because of a positive past 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, the field is formidable with 12 former champions competing: Beck; 
T.C. Chen, 1987; Doug Tewell, 1986; Lanny Wadkins, 1985 and '79; Dave Edwards, 
1984; Gil Morgan, 1983 and '78; Tom Watson, 1982 and '80; Johnny Miller, 1981; 
Tom Purtzer, 1977; Hale Irwin, 1976; Dave Stockton, 1974, and George Archer, 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 9 of the top 10 money winners in 1988 are in the field: Strange, 
Beck, Ken Green, Tom Kite, Mark Calcavecchia, Sandy Lyle, Ben Crenshaw, David 
Frost and Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
Watson is among the many pros who revere the Riviera course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the ultimate type of course," he said. "Some people can't break 100 here, 
but will still have a good time. And it's a real test of golf for a pro. 
</P>
<P>
"With the weather like it is, there should be some low scores. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse is $1 million and the winner's share is $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
With escalating purses, the tour has become more competitive, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes only 2 or 3 good years for a person to make a lifetime amount of 
earnings if he plays well," Watson said. "We're talking about people earning $1 
million in year (as Strange did in 1988)." 
</P>
<P>
Beck was asked if it's possible now for any one player to win 8 tournaments in 
a year, as Miller did in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe the human potential is greater than the mass," Beck said. "One 
man can do it and in time it will happen. However, a (Jack) Nicklaus comes 
along just once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus' victory in the 1986 Masters at age 46 inspired Beck. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so impressed by that performance," he said. I think it was (then) that I 
knew it was more important to believe you could win, versus having all the 
physical capabilities to win. I don't think Jack was in his best physical 
shape, yet he won. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many elements to the game and that's what makes it so great. It 
affects every player, even the amateurs. It's hard to play the same every day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the spirit of the game that produces a lot of humility and a feeling of 
satisfaction if you can master it for a week, or even a day." 
</P>
<P>
Beck is reasonably satisfied with his game at this juncture of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He finished fifth in the Tournament of Champions at La Costa, earning $31,000. 
He didn't fare as well in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, earning $12,171. 
</P>
<P>
But he finished second to Calcavecchia in the Phoenix Open for a $75,000 
payday. He didn't play in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am while 
preparing for the L.A. Open. 
</P>
<P>
His goals for the year? 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing about golf is that your goals are set for you every week," Beck 
said. "How high is the mountain?" 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chip Beck shot a 65 Wednesday in the pro-am event, the low round. Jodie Mudd 
and his team of Ed Schiller, Irwin Smith, Larry Kaleff and Harold Becker won 
the team championship with a net 53. . . . Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, 
hitting, of course, from the left side, reportedly almost drove the green on 
the 310-yard 10th hole. Valenzuela claims he has a 13 handicap. He was playing 
with pro Ken Green. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stockton said that he has always tried to help the young players on the 
Tour. He recalled that when he started on the tour, only Don January and a few 
others tried to help him. Stockton added that Sam Snead was not among them and 
remembered specifically how Snead tried to psych him in the 1974 L.A. Open: 
</P>
<P>
"On the 17th hole, I have 115 yards left and he has 130. He hit his shot and 
walked right past my ball and onto the green and marked his ball." 
</P>
<P>
After missing his putt, Stockton had only a 1-shot lead over Snead as they went 
to the 18th tee. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he turned to me and said, 'Son, you probably don't remember this, but I 
birdied the last 3 holes to beat Ben Hogan here in 1950.' 
</P>
<P>
"I walked away from him and the more I thought about what he said, the madder I 
got, which is exactly what he wanted me to do. I was so mad I was determined to 
birdie the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I just killed a 3-wood, 243 yards to the hole and, though it didn't get on TV. 
I just turned around and shook my fist right in his face. Then I walked up and 
made the 12-foot putt for a birdie to win."

VANDEWEGHE FINDS SPOT TO SHOOT DOWN CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kiki Vandeweghe, one of the main characters in the Portland Trail Blazers' 
season-long family feud, found his spot Wednesday night on the Sports Arena 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just made a couple of jumpers, that's all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three straight from the same spot, to be exact. Three jumpers from the right 
baseline, a few steps in from the corner, in the final 2 minutes to bury the 
Clippers and their bid to end a losing streak -- now at 16 -- and give the 
Trail Blazers a 108-107 victory before a crowd of 9,991. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe, who has continually asked to be traded because of his reduced role 
this season, scored 24 of his game-high 28 points in the second half. He also 
finished with 6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The last of his jumpers came with 47 seconds left to put Portland ahead, 
108-105. The Clippers closed to within a point on Joe Wolf's basket with 37 
seconds left and then had a chance to win when Wolf grabbed Terry Porter's 
errant pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers called time out with 9 seconds remaining and designed a play that 
was supposed to go to Charles Smith, who scored 22 points. But Tom Garrick, a 
shooting guard starting at the point in Gary Grant's absence, was covered 
closely by Clyde Drexler as he neared the right side of the lane. Garrick 
couldn't get the ball to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Garrick, who had 14 points, 10 assists and only 2 turnovers, went down the 
middle and took a 7-foot shot that hit the front of the rim. Wolf got a finger 
on the ball for a last-second tip, but that didn't go down, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt comfortable with it," Garrick said. "I was in the middle of the lane. 
Some people would look at it as off-balance, but I like those shots, so I took 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Don Casey, after the Clippers fell to 10-33, 0-5 in his tenure as interim 
coach: "Driving the middle against a team like this is a disaster because they 
close in so fast." 
</P>
<P>
With their roster already reduced to 10 players because Grant was in Ohio with 
his sick mother and Grant Gondrezick was suspended indefinitely while in a 
substance abuse center, the Clippers lost their second-leading scorer with 59 
seconds to play in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman, who scored 22 points in Monday's loss against the Atlanta Hawks, 
was ejected with Portland's Jerome Kersey when they got into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
With play going on, they squared off under the basket, standing nearly 
nose-to-nose for a few seconds before Kersey pushed Norman in the chest. Norman 
countered by landing a hard right, and the 6-foot 7-inch Kersey retaliated with 
a right that sent the 6-8 Norman to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Norman got up quickly, just in time to see the referees directing him to the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were leading, 57-48, at the time and held a 59-50 halftime 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
They increased the lead to 65-52 with 10:48 to play in the third quarter, but 
then suddenly began looking like the team that got trampled in the second half 
against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, winners of 16 straight against the Clippers, tied the score, 
84-84, at the end of the third quarter with a 14-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
With 233 assists this season going into Wednesday night's game, Norm Nixon has 
moved past John Havlicek and Jerry West and into seventh place on the National 
Basketball Assn. all-time list. Nixon, in his 10th season, has 6,280 career 
assists, putting him 196 behind Nate Archibald for sixth place. Oscar Robertson 
is No. 1 with 9,887. "I haven't been aware of anything like that this season," 
Nixon said. "This isn't one of those years to be into stats." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers and Dallas Mavericks have discussed a trade that would send Mark 
Aguirre to Los Angeles, Ken Norman being mentioned most as the player who would 
go in exchange, although it doesn't appear to be any closer to completion than 
the Mavericks' dealings with several other teams. "My impression is that 
they're talking to a lot of people, including us," Clipper president Alan 
Rothenberg said. "But nothing is imminent. I think they (the Mavericks) are 
conducting a bit of an auction, hearing what one team has to offer and then 
taking it to other teams to see if they can top it." Said General Manager Elgin 
Baylor: "We've been talking to Dallas for the last 3 years about Mark Aguirre." 
The most glamorous deal mentioned: Aguirre to Detroit for Adrian Dantley, with 
a few other players thrown in for good measure. A holdup to a deal with most 
teams would be Aguirre's salary. The eighth-year player earns $715,700 this 
season, but he and Dallas owner Donald Carter have already "agreed to agree" to 
about double that figure sometime soon after March 4. League rules stipulate 
that a year must pass between contract adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor said the team didn't consider it a risk to sign Grant Gondrezick as a 
free agent before the season, despite a link to the Phoenix Suns' 
well-publicized cocaine problems during the 1986-87 season. "After talking to 
him and talking to his agent, we felt pretty safe with the player," Baylor 
said.

Andrew Gaze, a native Australian who plays for the No. 10-rated Seton Hall 
basketball team, said in a live radio interview back home, "We're doing very 
well, we're in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
There was silence Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't understand at first," Gaze told Newsday. "Back home there are only 
14 schools."

The subject was academics, and Illinois basketball Coach Lou Henson, who 
attended Okay (Okla.) High School, told the Chicago Sun-Times: "There were 13 
in my graduating class, so I can safely say I was in the top 10%. 
</P>

FUTURE STOCK; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA FRESHMAN DARRICK MARTIN WILL LEAD CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bemoaning a starting lineup that includes two rookies, UCLA basketball Coach 
Jim Harrick told a Seattle reporter last week: "You can hide one freshman, but 
you can't hide two." 
</P>
<P>
What's to hide? 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean, UCLA's leading scorer and No. 2 rebounder, has been one of the 
Bruins' most consistent players. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the month since he replaced Kevin Williams in the starting lineup, 
Darrick Martin has emerged as a star of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Though he was held scoreless and without a shot last week at Washington State, 
the elusive Martin averaged 11.5 points, 4 assists, 2 rebounds and 2 steals 
last month while making 62.5% of his shots and 71.4% of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday at Washington, in the best of his 8 games as a starter, he made 9 
of 10 shots and scored a season-high 22 points in a 93-74 Bruin victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of guys like that in the league," Washington Coach Andy 
Russo said of the 5-foot-11, 160-pound Martin. "He's real small and quick and 
can really get to the basket. He reminds me a lot of Nate Archibald." 
</P>
<P>
And destined to be even better, Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if UCLA will benefit from Pooh Richardson's graduation, but I can 
promise you Darrick Martin will benefit from it because he'll be able to play 
his true position," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the consummate point guard in that it will be impossible to press UCLA. 
Second of all, he's quick enough to defend and he's a very smart player who 
will make sure they run their offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy they'll be able to hang their hat on for 3 more years and not have 
to worry about many of the things a lot of us have to worry about in terms of 
leadership and floor generalship." 
</P>
<P>
Truth be known, Harrick is delighted to have Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of think that he's going to win a lot of games for us before he's 
through," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick calls him "incredibly poised for a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who skipped the seventh grade at New Life Baptist School in Lynwood and 
won't be 18 until the week before the Pacific 10 Conference tournament next 
month, almost didn't make it to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A high school All-American at St. Anthony High in Long Beach, he signed a 
letter of intent with the Bruins in the fall of 1987, turning down offers from 
Nevada Las Vegas, Arizona and Duke. Martin was enamored of Duke, but chose to 
stay close to his family, which lives in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
He is especially close to the older of his two brothers, Andre, 16, who is 
learning disabled with autistic traits. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the main reason Darrick stayed (in Los Angeles)," Martin's father, Jesse, 
said of Andre. "Darrick feels a very strong commitment to his brother -- to 
allow him to share and participate in the things he has an opportunity to 
(experience)." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the day after Martin signed, his father, who works for IBM, was 
offered a job in Charlotte, N.C., which is about a 3-hour drive from the Duke 
campus at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even have the heart to tell Coach K.," Martin said of Duke Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski. "If it would have happened a little earlier, I might have ended up 
at Duke." 
</P>
<P>
Then, upset about learning of UCLA's firing of former Coach Walt Hazzard from a 
televised news report, Martin attempted to have his letter of intent 
invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
Before he signed, Martin said, he was told by Athletic Director Pete Dalis that 
Hazzard would not be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuffed in his effort to have his letter of intent invalidated, Martin 
considered attending a junior college for a year, or sitting out this season at 
another major college. Ultimately, though, he decided to abide by his letter 
after he and his father had met with Harrick, Dalis, Chancellor Charles Young 
and Vice Chancellor Elwin Svenson. 
</P>
<P>
He's glad that he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very comfortable with my situation," Martin said. "I enjoy going to school 
here, I enjoy the social life and I enjoy basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Not everything has gone strictly according to plan, though. 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the start of the season, his right foot was run over by a car 
driven by Chanel Landreaux, a junior at UCLA and daughter of UCLA assistant 
coach Paul Landreaux. Fortunately, the accident resulted only in a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Martin started the season as UCLA's third guard. He blossomed as a 
starter -- "I'm playing more relaxed," he said -- but then came the forgettable 
game at Washington State. Afterward, he phoned his mother, Pam, who told him: 
"You never played like that, even when you were little." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, Martin has proven to be a productive partner for senior guard 
Pooh Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beginning to be just like high school for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is a charismatic figure on the court, smiling and prodding the crowd by 
throwing his fists into the air. Martin has the ability to develop into one of 
the country's best point guards, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen many guys that can handle him," Harrick said. "Nobody's been 
able to press him. I don't remember anybody stealing the ball from him." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when Richardson got into foul trouble in an 84-75 loss at Stanford, 
Martin took control of the offense, contributing 15 points and a season-high 6 
assists and scoring on several acrobatic drives. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to the hole on them about four times -- just blew by," Harrick said. 
"In fact, he invented a play. The forward came across like he's supposed to and 
he just waved at him. 'Get out of the way.' He juked (Terry) Taylor and went to 
the basket and got fouled. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over to the bench and said, 'They can't stop me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even if he is a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
A blood test Wednesday showed that Don MacLean does not have mononucleosis, 
according to his mother, Pat. MacLean lost more than 10 pounds last month as 
UCLA played six of eight games on the road. Results of two other blood tests 
will be known today, she said. . . . UCLA, which is 12-5 overall and 7-2 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference, will play Oregon (7-11, 2-6) at 7:30 tonight at Pauley 
Pavilion. UCLA beat Oregon last month at Eugene, Ore., 97-66. . . . Coach Jim 
Harrick, contrasting UCLA's 2 victories in the Northwest last week: "When you 
watched us at Washington, you saw a clinic. But when you watched us at 
Washington State, you laughed." Or cried.

The pace is slow in Corvallis, Ore., a college town in the lush Willamette 
Valley about 100 miles south of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown looks like the set from "American Graffiti." Gangs around Corvallis 
are the kids who hang out at the local convenience store on weekends and cruise 
in their hot rods. 
</P>
<P>
When Gary Payton, a high school basketball phenom, visited on a recruiting trip 
to Oregon State in 1986, he was ready to go right back home to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
A street-wise city boy, Payton felt out of place in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Payton had dreamed of attending St. John's, where he could bask in the 
national limelight. He even made an oral commitment to St. John's after 
visiting New York, where he toured Manhattan in a limousine. Lou Carnesecca, 
coach at St. John's, closed the deal with Payton's parents. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to our house and gave us a lot of promises," said Payton's father, Al. 
"He told us he was going to take care of Gary. I wanted him to go where they 
had an older coach who could look after Gary because he'd never been away from 
home before, not even for a night." 
</P>
<P>
But Carnesecca reneged after signing another guard, and Payton eventually 
signed with Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to big-time college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of shocked me that they had set me up like that," Payton said. "They 
were running a game." 
</P>
<P>
Carnesecca said: "We made a mistake. We should have signed him. He's a great 
player. We really blew it." 
</P>
<P>
But Payton, a 6-foot 3-inch junior, has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
Payton has emerged as an extraordinary point guard. Some say he's among the 
nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's not the best point guard, he's right up there with whoever is," said 
George Raveling, USC basketball coach. "Those who see him on a regular basis 
realize he's right up there with B.J. Armstrong (of Iowa) and Sherman Douglas 
(of Syracuse). But he's not a player who's fully appreciated nationally." 
</P>
<P>
Payton could have gained a lot of respect by making the 1988 Olympic team. He 
was invited to the tryouts but failed a physical because of an irregular 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the weakest excuse for me to go home," Payton said. "I had a chest 
cold and told our trainer. I didn't think it was serious, but they took it in a 
big way. They put me through all sorts of tests, like the treadmill. And I had 
a tingling sensation when I got off." 
</P>
<P>
He underwent further tests in Corvallis, which indicated nothing abnormal. 
Payton thought he'd be able to return, but Coach John Thompson wouldn't allow 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Not making the Olympic team has given Payton added incentive this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that it hurt us that he didn't make the team because he still had 
a lot of proving to do this season," said Ralph Miller, Oregon State coach. 
</P>
<P>
Payton leads the Beavers in scoring, rebounding, steals, minutes played and 
assists going into tonight's game against USC at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's career assist leader, with 596, Payton is on a pace that would 
break the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record. The mark of 894 is held by 
Andre LaFleur, formerly of Northeastern. 
</P>
<P>
A poor shooter in his first 2 seasons, Payton has blossomed as the Pacific 10's 
leading scorer with a 22.9-point average. He was obsessed with improving his 
range last summer, taking 500 shots a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Payton has really jumped his game up a level, especially offensively," UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick said. "He's stepped up to where he's right up there with the 
best guards in America. 
</P>
<P>
"But nothing's more impressive than his shot. He shoots a 3-pointer like it's a 
layup. Before, you'd beg him to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Payton has elevated his game to an even higher level in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a career-high 41 points against Washington State 2 weeks ago, putting 
himself in elite company. Gail Goodrich is the only other Pac-10 guard who has 
scored 41 points or more in a game. The former UCLA star had 42 against 
Michigan in the 1965 NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
In a 69-64 overtime victory at Cal last week, Payton scored all 9 of Oregon 
State's points in the extra period. After being held to 4 points in the first 
half, Payton finished with 24. 
</P>
<P>
Payton was spurred by the Cal rooting section, which taunted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary was having a perfectly miserable game until they tried to discombobulate 
him," Miller said. "As far as I'm concerned, they picked on the right player. 
They should have learned by now that you don't get on him." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Payton sometimes goes out of his way to incite opposing fans because 
the reaction motivates him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one that the other team loves to hate," said Mike Corwin, Oregon 
State publicist. "A crowd will always pick him out because he's easy not to 
like." 
</P>
<P>
Payton wears his arrogance as a badge of honor on the court, strutting as if he 
owns the world. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a cocky little rascal," Miller said. "I've never seen a little guy who 
was pretty good that wasn't on the cocky side. As long as it doesn't get out of 
hand that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
A master at intimidation, Payton likes to talk to his opponents on the court to 
upset them. His icy glare -- "the evil look" -- is a staple. Payton developed 
his style at Skyline High, which competes in the rough Oakland Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through riots and fights in the OAL," Payton said. "People would try 
to punk you out and you had to be tough enough to come back at them. I just 
brought my high school with me to college." 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers reflect Payton's style off the court, too. 
</P>
<P>
After big victories, Payton leads the team in a chorus-line dance -- packing 
burgers -- the players moving their hands as if they're scooping hamburgers off 
a grill. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State beat USC at Corvallis last month, 64-55. George Raveling, USC 
coach, presented Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller a Playboy magazine before the 
last game, saying he wanted to distract Miller. Miller sent the magazine back 
to Raveling and asked him to autograph it. "My wife would never believe George 
gave it to me unless he signed it," Miller said. . . . USC is 7-12 overall and 
0-8 in the Pacific 10. Oregon State is 13-4 overall and 6-3 in the conference.

SOME BIG NAMES UNPROTECTED BY RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
HAYNES, LOFTON, CHRISTENSEN AMONG THOSE TO BE FREE AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders have protected 37 players for the National Football League's 
upcoming first free-agent period, but the ones they've left exposed look like 
the cast from one of their mid-'80s highlight films. 
</P>
<P>
Free to take bids from other teams in the Feb. 2-April 1 period, according to a 
Raider source, are: 
</P>
<P>
Mike Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
James Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Linden King. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
Charley Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Fellows. 
</P>
<P>
That's both of their starting cornerbacks last season, both outside 
linebackers, two star receivers, their longtime left guard and their kicker 
throughout this decade. 
</P>
<P>
All were starters last season, all are over age 30 and all were highly paid. 
The Raiders are hoping that the other teams, few of which pay Raider scale, 
will pass on them. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise is Haynes, the oldest and highest paid of the exposed 
Raiders. A Hall of Fame candidate-in-waiting, he was facing the possibility of 
being cut in training camp last season, but came back to have a strong season. 
He could conceivably attract some interest, even though he's 35 and earns about 
$750,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton, 32, will make $725,000 next season between salary ($525,000) and his 
reporting bonus ($200,000). He can still play, but he had a down season and 
would face a tough fight next season to beat out Tim Brown, Willie Gault and 
Mervyn Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, 32, missed most of last season with a leg injury, may need 
additional surgery, has gone from 92 receptions to 47 to 12 since 1986 and was 
at $750,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 34, the dean of the Raiders, and their right outside linebacker since 
1978, was only a part-time starter last season, leaving the field when the 
Raiders used a four-man line. He isn't thought to figure highly in the team's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Linden King, 33, the left outside linebacker, who is considering 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr, 35, the Raider kicker since 1980, had a down season in 1987, got off to a 
slow start in '88 and almost lost his job to John Lee early in the season 
before rallying. 
</P>
<P>
Fellows, 32, gave the Raiders a decent season as a surprise starter at left 
cornerback. However, the expected return of Terry McDaniel, out with a broken 
leg for all but a couple of games of his rookie season, would drop Fellows to 
second string. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah, 33, a starting guard for most of the last six seasons, has undergone 
reconstructive knee surgery.

CS FULLERTON TO PLAY HOST TO UC IRVINE IN BATTLE FOR 7TH IN BIG WEST CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton-UC Irvine rivalry may not have lost its meaning for the 
players, but it certainly doesn't have the kind of impact on the Big West 
Conference race it once did. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, 8-9 overall and 3-5 in the Big West, will play host to the Anteaters 
(6-11, 3-5) at 7:30 tonight in Titan Gym with the winner taking over seventh 
place in the Big West standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans are coming off a 65-44 defeat at Fresno State Monday night that 
Coach John Sneed labeled a "total embarrassment." The loss snapped a 3-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, 1-8 on the road, committed 23 turnovers in Saturday night's 75-70 loss 
at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan has been unhappy with his guards' shooting, so the 
Anteaters will try to get the ball to center Mike Doktorczyk, who is second in 
the nation in 3-point field goal percentage at 58.7%, and power forward Ricky 
Butler, who had a career-high 17 points and 8 rebounds against Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is led by Cedric Ceballos, who is averaging 21 points and 9 rebounds 
a game. JOHN WEYLER

<P>
The Cal State Long Beach basketball team will play Utah State in a battle for 
fourth place in the Big West Conference tonight at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is 8-10 overall and Utah State is 7-12, but each is 5-4 in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are led by center John Hatten, who, coming off a career-high 37 
points against UC Irvine, has averaged 20 in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Reid Newey is Utah State's leading scorer, averaging 20.4 points. DICK WAGNER

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CLEMSON STUNS THIRD-RANKED TAR HEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirkland Howling was just following instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Howling hit a 3-point shot to give Clemson the lead with 53 seconds remaining 
and added 2 free throws with 24 seconds left Thursday night to give the Tigers 
an 85-82 upset of third-ranked North Carolina in an Atlantic Coast Conference 
game at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Cliff Ellis) told me to take the open 3-pointers, and it was open for a 
second," Howling said. "I took it, and I felt it (was good) when I released 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only Clemson's second over the Tar Heels in 20 games and the 
first since 1985. North Carolina has an 85-12 lead in the series, which dates 
to 1926. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (18-4 overall, 5-2 in the ACC) took an 82-80 lead on 2 free 
throws by J.R. Reid with 1:21 left, but while Reid was at the line, Ellis 
inserted Howling, who finished with 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a gut feeling Dean (Smith, North Carolina coach) was going to go to a 
zone, so I put Howling in," Ellis said. "We were lucky they went to the zone. 
We might have been in trouble if they had used a man-to-man because our 
ball-handlers were not in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Davis had 21 points and 21 rebounds for Clemson (13-5, 4-3), and Elden 
Campbell added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Reid scored 25 points for the Tar Heels and Kevin Madden added 19, but senior 
guard Jeff Lebo was held scoreless for the first time as a Tar Heel, missing 
all 7 shots he took. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 99, Florida State 82 -- Elliott Perry scored 33 points and Rodney 
Douglas had 17 points and 15 rebounds as the Tigers surprised the eighth-ranked 
Seminoles at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Perry made 8 of 20 shots and 15 of 16 free throws and Douglas made 7 baskets 
and 3 free throws without a miss for Memphis State (14-7, 3-2), which scored 
the first 9 points and never was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers made 63% of their shots, built a 19-point lead before halftime and 
had an 87-58 lead before Florida State (16-2, 4-1) rallied far too late. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dawson scored 22 points for the Seminoles, who made just 35% of their 
shots, but leading scorer George McCloud was more than 5 points below his 
average at 18 points and made just 4 of 20 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Mitchell, starting in place of injured Tharon Mayes for Florida State, 
scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 76, Ohio State 73 -- Melvin Newbern, who missed a free throw with 59 
seconds left, made a layup with 8 seconds left and the Gophers knocked off the 
No. 15 Buckeyes in a Big Ten game at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton scored 13 of his 30 points in the last 8 minutes for Minnesota 
(12-6, 4-4), which posted its third upset of a Top 20 team in 19 days. 
Minnesota beat then-No. 5 Iowa on Jan. 14 and then No. 1 Illinois last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (15-5, 4-3) had a chance to regain the lead after Newbern's layup 
made it 74-73, but Jay Burson was called for double-dribble just before he made 
a 15-foot jumper with 3 seconds left. The Buckeyes' bench was hit with a 
technical and Burton made both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers led, 72-71, when Newbern missed the front end of a 1-and-1. Ohio 
State's Grady Mateen, who came off the bench to score 19 points, made 2 free 
throws with 34 seconds left to give the Buckeyes a 73-72 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Burson, averaging 23.4 points on 52% shooting, had 12 points, making 4 of 15 
shots and committing 9 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 91, North Carolina State 71 -- Richard Morgan scored 20 points and 
sparked an early surge that carried the Cavaliers to an ACC upset of the No. 13 
Wolfpack at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Curtis Williams scored 6 points apiece as Virginia (12-6, 4-2) 
jumped to a 25-4 lead midway through the first half. Morgan also made 2 free 
throws to cap an 11-1 burst at the start of the second half that gave the 
Cavaliers a 64-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe and Chucky Brown scored 18 points each for N.C. State (14-3, 
5-2). John Crotty added 18 points for Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 90, Kansas State 82 -- Stacey King scored 20 of his 27 points in the 
second half as the Sooners scored a Big Eight victory over the Wildcats in 
their first game ever as the nation's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State (12-6, 3-3) tied the score, 80-80, on Fred McCoy's hook shot with 
3:23 left, but Terrence Mullins put Oklahoma (18-2, 5-0) ahead for good with a 
3-pointer and Tyrone Jones added a basket as the Sooners finished with a 10-2 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
Each time Kansas State threatened in the second half, the Sooners responded. 
After Steve Henson's basket gave the Wildcats their second lead of the game, 
68-67, with 8:32 left, King scored 8 straight points as the Sooners went back 
on top, 75-68. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 91, Kansas 66 -- Byron Irvin scored 22 points and Lee Coward added 19 
to lead the fifth-ranked Tigers past the Jayhawks in a Big Eight Conference 
game at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
It was Missouri's first victory on the Jayhawks' court in 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (16-5, 3-3) was within 54-48 with 14 minutes left when Coward made 2 
baskets. Irvin stole the ball and drove the length of the court for a 3-point 
play that gave Missouri (19-3, 5-0) a 63-50 lead with 11:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Newton scored 14 points for Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 90, Villanova 57 -- Derrick Coleman scored 20 points and the No. 14 
Orangemen scored 17 unanswered points in the first half of a Big East 
Conference victory over the Wildcats at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova (12-9, 3-4), which upset Syracuse, 75-73, last month, fell behind, 
47-27, at halftime and made its only run early in the second half. The Wildcats 
had a 10-2 spurt to make it 49-37, but Syracuse (18-4, 4-4) responded with a 
9-3 surge and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen limited Villanova to 22% shooting in the first half, and the 
Wildcats went through a 12-minute stretch with their lone basket coming on a 
goaltending call. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Greis, who missed all 10 of his shots in the first half, scored 14 points 
for Villanova. Stephen Thompson, who scored 2 points the last time against 
Villanova, rebounded with 17 for Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 74, Seton Hall 66 -- Freshman Alonzo Mourning scored 17 points and 
ignited a second-half surge as the sixth-ranked Hoyas avenged their only Big 
East Conference defeat by downing the 10th-ranked Pirates at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning made a driving layup over Ramon Ramos to give Georgetown (16-2, 6-1) a 
42-39 lead and start a 9-2 run that made it 49-41 with 9:09 left. Seton Hall 
(18-3, 5-3) never got closer than 3 points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown made 14 free throws in the final 3:04, including 5 by Anthony Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith scored 18 points for Georgetown, which bounced back after 
Saturday's upset loss to Louisiana State. John Morton had 15 points for Seton 
Hall and Andrew Gaze scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 108, Virginia Tech 95 -- Tony Kimbro had 21 points and 12 rebounds, 
and Keith Williams added 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead the seventh-ranked 
Cardinals past the Hokies in a Metro Conference game at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Playing its first full game without injured center Pervis Ellison, Louisville 
(15-3, 4-0) took over the conference lead when Memphis State upset Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals led, 51-44, with 18 1/2 minutes left when Kenny Payne scored 6 of 
his 20 points to spark a 13-5 outburst that put the Cardinals in command, 
64-49. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison sprained a ligament in his left knee in Sunday's loss to Ohio State. 
Felton Spencer started in place of Ellison, who will miss several games with a 
knee injury, and had 19 points and 8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bimbo Coles scored 36 points and Wally Lancaster had 27 for Virginia Tech 
(7-12, 0-5). 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State 105, Mississippi 75 -- Vernel Singleton scored 23 points, and 
Rickey Blanton and Chris Jackson added 21 points each and the No. 19 Tigers 
trounced the Rebels in a Southeastern Conference game at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton hit a pair of 3-point shots to start a 26-14 run that gave LSU (15-5, 
7-2) a 45-35 halftime lead as Ole Miss (11-7, 5-4) made only 3 of 17 shots in 
the final 10:04 of the half. 
</P>
<P>
The loss broke a 4-game wining streak for Mississippi, which has not won 5 in a 
row since the 1937-38 season. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Glass scored 31 points and Tim Jumper added 24 for Mississippi.

Jim Bakken, former kicker for the St. Louis Cardinal football team, has been 
given 3 years' probation on his guilty plea to charges of failing to pay enough 
tax on income from an investment club in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Bakken, now vice president of marketing for Cass Bank &amp; Trust Co. in St. 
Louis, played for the Cardinals, who since have moved to Phoenix, from 
1962-1978. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the pyramid investment club was an illegal get-rich-quick 
scheme that flourished in Missouri in the early 1980s. The IRS reported in 1984 
that about 465 taxpayers made money in the scheme and that more than $2.6 
million in taxes, penalties and interest were underpaid.

NEWSWIRE: HERZEG ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AS GENERAL MANAGER OF HOUSTON OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ladd Herzeg, general manager of the Houston Oilers, resigned Wednesday from the 
post he has held since 1981, saying he is ready to try something new. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I've accomplished my goals in Houston, and at this point in my life, 
I'm ready for a new challenge," he said in a statement. "I know there is 
another mountain out there that needs to be conquered." 
</P>
<P>
Herzeg, who was not available for comment, did not say what he planned to do. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scheduled a news conference for this morning, saying it was related 
to Herzeg. They would not confirm Herzeg's resignation or specify the reason 
for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Herzeg has had a stormy career as Oiler general manager. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he was involved in an altercation in Buffalo when he allegedly 
disrupted a wedding reception that was being held at the same hotel where the 
Oilers were staying. 
</P>
<P>
This past season, he was the subject of a paternity suit and was recently 
involved in a slapping incident involving a Houston Chronicle reporter. 
</P>
<P>
After the paternity suit incident, Herzeg resigned but his resignation was 
rejected by Oiler owner Bud Adams.

Jack Clark has signed a 2-year contract with the San Diego Padres worth $4 
million, fulfilling an arrangement made when San Diego acquired the 
power-hitting first baseman in an October trade. The agreement replaces the 
final year of Clark's 2-year, $3-million contract, which he signed with the New 
York Yankees a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We had agreed to honor a 2-year commitment that was made to Jack Clark prior 
to the trade," said Dick Freeman, acting club president. "It took some time to 
finalize the agreement due to a busy winter for both us and his agent, Tom 
Reich." 
</P>
<P>
Clark will get $2 million a season from the Padres. Under the old deal, he 
would have received a base salary of $1.5 million in 1989 with the opportunity 
to earn $500,000 in bonuses.

<P>
CAL STATE L.A. WOMEN HOPING SLOW START BRINGS FAST FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Over the last 2 seasons, frustration has become an all-too familiar feeling for 
the Cal State Los Angeles women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles thought they played well enough to earn a berth in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division II playoffs in each of the last 2 
seasons, only to be passed over by the Western Regional selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Golden Eagles had a 19-9 record -- one of the best 
regular-season marks among Division II teams on the West Coast. But they 
couldn't compete in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament 
because, according to NCAA rules, they played 1 too many regular-season games. 
Because they had to miss the tournament, they were not considered for the NCAA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Cal State L.A. finished with a 16-12 record and placed second to 
national power Cal Poly Pomona in the CCAA tournament, but missed out again. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches Fran Buckless hopes this is the year her team makes the playoffs. The 
Golden Eagles (12-8 overall) are tied for second with Cal State Northridge at 
3-1 despite a bumpy start. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of adversity, but I think we've gotten stronger because of it, 
and we've been able to overcome it," Buckless said. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles played 11 of their first 13 games on the road. They played 
top 20 Division II teams such as Alaska Anchorage, twice, Air Force, West Texas 
State and West Georgia, and Division I Fresno State and Colorado State in 
nonconference play. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that in the long run, that'll pay off for us when we go to the 
(CCAA) tournament and I think it will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. had a 4-6 start that also can be traced to illness and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious came just before the start of the season, when starting 
forward Tina Slatinsky underwent an emergency appendectomy and missed the first 
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Also, forward Lori Thompson missed 3 games with a rib injury; swing player 
LynnDee Fader probably is out for the season with a stress fracture in her 
foot, and guard Millie Junio and forward Sandra Acosta have played despite 
recurring injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Guard LeeAnn Horner was leading the Golden Eagles in scoring before she left 
the team in late November because she was homesick. Also, Frank Candida, the 
school's sports information director who was close to many of the players, died 
on Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on a road trip at the time (in Alaska) and that really hit us hard," 
Buckless said. " . . . We've dedicated this season to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles have played particularly well since the start of January, 
winning 6 of 7 games. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence is partly due to the return of Slatinsky, who has averaged 11.5 
points in 11 games, and the addition of forward Trisha Maly, a former 
Pepperdine starter who has averaged 13.9 points since joining in early January. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong bench and we feel confident that we won't have any let-up 
when we go to it," she said. " . . . We can go 9, 10 and 11 deep. In our last 
game (a 77-68 victory over Chapman), we used our whole bench and everyone 
except one played played at least 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Buckless said she has seen considerable improvement in Thompson, a freshman, 
and center Diane Williams, a sophomore, and has been comfortable with the 
rotation of Anita Martinez, Krystall Cade and Junio at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Lupe Quintana has averaged 14.7 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that he led College Division schools in the Southland in scoring 
last season, it is no surprise that guard Steve deLaveaga of the Cal Lutheran 
men's basketball team is the top offensive player again. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 senior, who averages 25.7 points, has scored in double figures in 74 
consecutive games over the last 3 seasons since his streak started with 31 
points against Cal Poly Pomona on Dec. 9, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
During the streak, he has scored 20 or more points 51 times, 30 or more on 22 
occasions and 40 or more twice. 
</P>
<P>
He does not have enough games remaining in his career to catch the all-time 
NCAA leader, Lou Stevens of Widener University in Chester, Pa., who scored in 
double figures in 104 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College announced last week that it will drop men's and women's track, 
men's and women's cross-country, men's volleyball and women's tennis from its 
athletic program at the end of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, which was considering a move to the NCAA Division III Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, will remain in the Division II 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside's men's basketball team is ranked No. 1 in the NCAA Division II 
for the first time since the 1978-79 season. The Highlanders (16-2) were ranked 
No. 4 last week but moved up to No. 1 after the three top teams lost. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Quintana of the Cal State Los Angeles women's basketball team became the 
all-time California Collegiate Athletic Assn. leader in rebounds with 13 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills last week. That gave Quintana 474 and pushed 
her past Vickie Mitchell, former Cal Poly Pomona All-American who had 465. . . 
. Since splitting its first 4 games, the Cal State Los Angeles men's basketball 
team has dropped 14 straight and its CCAA losing streak grew to 20 with a 93-68 
loss to Chapman last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Trent Morgan of Cal State Northridge was named to the NCAA Division II 
All-American first team by the National Weekly Football Gazette. Morgan, an 
All-Western Football Conference pick, punted 59 times for 2,546 yards and a 
43.5-yard average last season. Center Greg Jordan of Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, a 
6-1 senior considered the team's top blocker the last 3 seasons, was chosen to 
the NCAA Division III All-American third team.

Circle K Corp., a large convenience store operator, said it has hired an 
investment banker to explore options to enhance shareholders' value -- news 
that caused the company's shares to rise sharply. The Phoenix-based company 
said it hired Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. to look into such options as an 
expansion, restructuring, recapitalization, a merger or joint venture. Circle 
K's shares closed up $2.25 at $14.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

J. C. Penney said it will leave the casualty insurance business that it entered 
in 1976, when it began selling auto and homeowner policies through its stores 
and direct marketing. Its JCPenney Casualty Insurance Co. has 350,000 policies 
in force and collected $168 million last year in premiums -- 80% of it for auto 
insurance. Tillinghast &amp; Co., an insurance consulting firm, is helping 
Penney market the unit. Penney said it will continue selling life insurance 
through another subsidiary.

Farley Inc., which has been waging a hostile takeover battle for West 
Point-Pepperell Inc. since October, upped its bid to $1.53 billion and added 
that it now controled 62% of the textile giant's stock. It said its increased 
offer, equivalent to $52 per share, "demonstrates our resolve to acquire West 
Point-Pepperell." Farley, a closely held investment firm, said it was also 
extending its offer to Feb. 15 from Feb. 1, and added that as of Jan. 25 about 
15.7 million West Point shares had been tendered to its Farley/WPM Acquisition 
Corp.

KAUFMAN SEES 'UPHEAVAL' FROM LBOS 
</P>

Henry Kaufman, one of Wall Street's leading economists, told the House Ways and 
Means Committee on Wednesday that, if leveraged buyouts are left unchecked, 
they will create a financial-industrial complex that will cause "a major 
upheaval in our economic and financial way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Offering the committee a pessimistic vision of the future, Kaufman predicted 
that the traditional American separation between the business and financial 
worlds would be erased as banks assume an ever greater role in financing the 
mergers, acquisitions and buyouts that are sweeping the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Governmental Intrusion' 
</P>
<P>
"Out of that will emerge a financial-industrial complex wherein financial 
institutions and industrial corporations become increasingly interwoven, rather 
than separate, distinct entities," Kaufman said. He likened such an economy to 
those in West Germany and Japan, where major banks play a crucial role in 
corporate decision making. 
</P>
<P>
"That amalgam will invite various forms of governmental intrusion, culminating 
in direct government participation in business through bailouts of corporations 
that fall into severe financial difficulties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, who last year ended a long association with Salomon Bros. to start his 
own firm, warned that huge corporate debt levels created by the leveraged 
buyout craze would undermine many companies in the next recession. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the recent wave of LBOs, with their emphasis on hostile 
takeovers, has distorted the stock market, weakened the ability of debt-laden 
corporations to compete overseas and cost the government money because of the 
tax deductibility of interest paid on debt. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman testified as the committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
continued to wrestle with the intricacies of LBOs and the question of how to 
control them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pros, Cons of Buyouts 
</P>
<P>
The House panel has heard the pros and cons of LBOs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pros: They create higher values for stockholders; they yield more 
productive companies, and they improve inefficient managements. 
</P>
<P>
Some cons: LBOs are driven by the desire of lawyers and investment bankers to 
earn big fees; they merely reshuffle assets rather than improve economic 
efficiency, and they result in layoffs and disruptions to employees, suppliers 
and customers. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to weave a path between those opposing views, committee members are 
discussing measures that would limit the tax incentives for buyouts -- or at 
least try to prevent buyouts when the risks are unduly high. Among the ideas 
that have been discussed is imposing tighter federal supervision over banks 
that participate in financing LBOs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, chairman of Unisys Corp., told 
the House panel that not all business consolidations are bad -- including the 
merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp. that created Unisys -- but said some 
are. He defined a bad LBO as one that has left a firm with "razor-thin" levels 
of cash to cover the debts taken on in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short-Term Gains Sought 
</P>
<P>
"These LBOs frequently are the result of financial manipulations for short-term 
gains but without any identifiable purpose in mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal and Kaufman said they favored eliminating the disparity between the 
tax treatment of corporate debt -- the interest is all deductible -- and 
dividends, which are taxed twice at the corporate and stockholder levels. 
</P>
<P>
Both said they favored doing away with the double taxation on dividends but 
agreed that was unlikely to happen because it would cost $20 billion to $40 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said he did not favor limits on interest deductions on corporate debt 
because the task would be too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said it might be possible to limit interest deductions on certain 
junk bonds -- in an extension of current tax laws. But he said care was needed 
to avoid putting U.S. companies at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.

Federal mediators said they would begin a 30-day "cooling off" between Eastern 
Airlines Inc. and its largest union today, a move that could lead to a strike 
early next month. Miami-based Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., on Tuesday 
rejected an offer from the National Mediation Board for binding arbitration to 
settle a 15-month-old contract dispute with its 9,000 machinists. That 
rejection allowed mediators to begin the cooling off period. If no settlement 
is reached by midnight EST on March 3, the union will be free to strike and 
Eastern will be allowed to impose the $144 million in wage cuts it says it 
needs to survive.

NORMAN LEAR, COLUMBIA FORM JOINT TV VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a move that will bring one of TV's most successful and innovative producers 
back to the medium, Columbia Pictures Television announced Wednesday that it 
has formed a joint venture with Norman Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Lear was dubbed the "sitcom king" in the 1970s, when his companies turned out a 
string of often provocative and socially conscious hit shows, including "All in 
the Family," "Maude," "Sanford and Son" and "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman." 
</P>
<P>
"The time just seemed right," Lear said Wednesday of his return to TV. "We're 
heading into the '90s, which will be a time far different from the '70s and, 
God knows, the '80s. I think it will be a far more reflective time, when people 
are thinking about where they're heading and where our culture is heading. 
What's it all about, Alfie? 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make some what's-it-all-about-Alfie TV shows again." 
</P>
<P>
No financial details were disclosed, but the agreement calls for Columbia to 
retain all domestic and foreign distribution rights to programming produced by 
the new venture, Act III Television, which will operate "with total creative 
and business autonomy," according to the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call it a deal with multiple zeros in it," Lear said. "We want to do 
360 degrees of television -- concentrating on situation comedies, but not to 
the exclusion of (early evening), late-night and children's programming." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Lear announced that he was taking an "extended leave" from the grind 
of TV production and left his creative post at Tandem Productions and T.A.T. 
Communications to focus on feature films and the business side of 
entertainment. He's made only two forays into TV since then, the unsuccessful 
"a.k.a. Pablo" in 1980 and a two-hour special called "I Love Liberty" in 1982. 
The latter show -- which one critic called the "first left-wing patriotic 
celebration" -- was an outgrowth of People for the American Way, an 
organization that Lear helped found in 1980 to promote freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
On the business side, Lear and his T.A.T. partner, Jerrold Perenchio, purchased 
Avco Embassy Pictures for $25 million in 1981 and merged the two companies to 
form Embassy Communications. He sold Embassy to Coca-Cola Co. for $485 million 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Movies Produced 
</P>
<P>
About 2 1/2 years ago, Lear launched Act III Communications. It now owns 12 
communications-industry trade publications -- including Channels magazine and 
Marketing &amp; Media Decisions -- six TV stations in the Southeastern U.S. and 
about 400 movie theaters in Texas, Washington and Oregon. Last week, Lear 
announced that he had sold a 20% stake in Act III Communications to Tractebel, 
a Belgian firm. 
</P>
<P>
Act III also produced two successful movies, "Stand by Me" and "The Princess 
Bride," which were directed by "All in the Family" alumnus Rob Reiner and 
distributed by Columbia Pictures. Act III recently completed production of a 
new Burt Reynolds movie called "Breaking In." 
</P>
<P>
"The last piece of the puzzle was TV production; we always planned to come 
back," Lear said.

Bond prices edged higher Wednesday, helped by strength in the dollar and relief 
about the government's announcement of its borrowing plans for early next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or about $2 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield fell to 8.80% from 8.82%. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said bond prices tended to follow the path of the dollar, falling early 
in the session as the dollar was weak but rebounding in the afternoon as the 
dollar suddenly moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
The market was heartened by the details of the government's announcement of 
plans to sell $28.75 billion in new securities next week, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for Dean Witter 
Reynolds, said there were worries that the Treasury planned to issue an 
abnormally large amount of longer-term issues in the February securities sale. 
</P>
<P>
But the Treasury's plans called for a fairly uniform division by maturity as it 
said it would sell $9.75 billion in three-year notes, $9.5 billion in 10-year 
notes and $9.5 billion in 30-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Bond prices came back after that because most people in the market realized 
that their fears about getting a lot of long-term debt were misplaced," 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said trading was fairly light, as many traders stayed out of the market 
in anticipation of the January employment report to be released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities were up 1/16 point and long-term 
issues gained 3/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service said. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a 
$1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 0.62 to 1,139.95. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, prices edged up. Moody's investment grade corporate bond 
index was up 0.18 to 299.37. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, prices were unchanged. The Bond Buyer index of 40 
actively traded municipal bonds held at 92-11/32, the same as late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 8.64% as the discount 
held at 8.35%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.86% as the discount fell 2 
basis points to 8.38%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.98% as the discount 
fell 2 basis points to 8.32%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.938%, down from 9.125% late Tuesday.

DOW BREAKS 6-DAY RALLY, ENDING OFF 4.11

Wall Street's Dow Jones industrials snapped a six-session winning streak 
Wednesday, pulling back from their post-crash highs on a lower dollar, surging 
oil prices and weak bond prices for much the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which had advanced in every session since last 
Tuesday, finished down 4.11 points at 2,338.21. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 753 up, 718 down and 518 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 215.64 million shares, up from 
194.05 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dollar-caused decline," said Edward Shopkorn, general partner in 
charge of institutional equities at Mabon Nugent. "But then, nothing goes 
straight up forever. The market could stand to give some back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
January Gains 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices also were weak much of the day as the bond market waited 
for the government to outline its quarterly refunding plan. But the benchmark 
30-year bond ended slightly higher, lowering its yield to 8.81% from 8.82%, 
after the Treasury unveiled plans that were much as expected. 
</P>
<P>
A 48-cent jump in U.S. crude oil futures, buoyed by higher heating oil prices, 
also burdened the equities market. Higher oil prices tend to lift costs 
throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow blue chip index has gained more than 100 points since last Tuesday as 
institutional investors returned to the equities market in force. 
</P>
<P>
For all of January, the Dow rose 173.57 points. That marked one of the most 
dramatic gains for January in recent years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point 
jump at the start of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was due in large part to the dollar's strength and firmer bond 
prices. But "the dollar has been hitting resistance on the chart and that made 
bonds pause and the stock market pause," explained Morry Markovitz, president 
of Mercury Management Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Markovitz said he believed that the recent stock market rally was no 
flash-in-the-pan. "We're in the early stages of the next bull market and blue 
chips at some point will pass the leadership to the smaller stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended generally higher on both the American Stock Exchange and in 
the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
However, Andrew McVeigh, director of research at Rodman &amp; Renshaw, said 
that he was worried by the unevenness of the market's advance. "This rally has 
been very segmented in that some of the over-the-counter stocks have moved, the 
Dow stocks have moved, but most in the middle tier have not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compaq Climbs 
</P>
<P>
He added that he was bothered by the lack of retail participation. "If we're 
going to take any shots at the highs, you need the retail investors," McVeigh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted caution over recent evidence of continued strength in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported in the morning that the index of leading 
economic indicators rose 0.6% in December, outpacing many advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, monthly statistics from the Labor Department are expected to show a 
good-sized gain in payroll employment for January. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer climbed 3 1/2 to 73 1/4. The company reported fourth-quarter 
earnings of $2.18 a share, against $1.25 in the like period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
West Point-Pepperell gained 2 1/2 to 53 1/4. Farley Inc. increased its offer 
for the company from $48 a share to $52 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K, which said it retained a merchant banking firm to study ways to 
increase the return to its shareholders, rose 2 1/4 to 14 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder System gained 1 1/8 to 28 1/8. The company said it plans to buy back as 
much as 15% of its stock and may sell four divisions, including its insurance 
management services operation. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chip and technology issues, Digital Equipment rose 1 
1/8 to 119 3/4; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained 5/8 to 32 1/8, and 
Ford Motor was up 1/2 at 55 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
But International Business Machines dropped 1 to 129 5/8 and General Electric 
was off 1/8 at 48 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Stocks Fall 
</P>
<P>
MCI Communications added 1/2 to 25 5/8 as the most active issue in the 
over-the-counter market. MCI posted substantially higher fourth-quarter 
operating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities ended the day at 2,916.890, down 0.371, 
from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped 0.16 to 
166.47. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.33 to 343.87, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was down 0.38 at 297.09. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.93 to 
403.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 
323.24, up 0.22. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices closed sharply lower Wednesday on worries that a 
declining yen would result in inflation and higher domestic interest rates. The 
Nikkei 225-share index fell 220.62 points, or 0.70%, to 31,360.68. 
</P>
<P>
A brief surge on Wall Street picked the London stock market up off the floor on 
Wednesday, but the market still closed lower, breaking a string of four 
straight rises. London shares were hit early in the session by investors taking 
profits from the surge in prices in recent days. But the Financial Times 
100-share index bounced off the day's lows to end 12.1 points down at 2,039.7.

IMPORTERS' GROUP LAUNCHES PALM OIL DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Importers of palm oil -- one of the so-called tropical oils accused of 
contributing to heart disease in America -- launched an expensive 
counter-offensive Wednesday urging American food manufacturers and consumers 
"not to be intimidated by scare tactics which are not based on scientific 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Assn., which has suffered a 44% decline in oil 
exports to the United States since 1986, said in a full-page advertisement in 
the USA Today newspaper that palm oil is a "healthy" and "nutritious" vegetable 
oil. The ad said the oil has not been proven to raise blood cholesterol levels 
as implied in recent negative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The ad is scheduled to run later in the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street 
Journal and the New York Times, said John Phipps, a spokesman for Hill &amp; 
Knowlton Inc., the public relations firm coordinating the campaign for the 
Malaysians. The initial ads will cost $205,000, Phipps said, but the Malaysians 
have established a palm oil promotion fund with about $10 million available 
over the next three years to respond to attacks on the oil. 
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian exporters said they are responding to an attack initiated two 
years ago by the American Soybean Assn. and a series of high-profile newspaper 
ads placed late last year by the American Heart Savers Assn. One of the effects 
of the campaign was that major food processors said they would no longer use 
tropical oils. 
</P>
<P>
Although tropical oils are cholesterol-free, they are high in saturated fats, 
which help to form cholesterol in the blood. High levels of cholesterol in 
individuals are a factor in heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, tropical oils have been replaced in food formulas with soybean 
oil, which is low in saturated fats. However, as used in food formulas, soybean 
oil is often hydrogenated -- a process that health experts warn has the effect 
of markedly increasing the saturated fatty acid content of the oil, leaving the 
consumer not much better off had he consumed the straight saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Health experts have expressed concern about the escalating advertising 
campaigns because they view them as misleading to the public. They said that 
tropical oils are such an insignificant contributor to the total fat in the 
American diet (less than 3.5% of the total fat, according to the Food and Drug 
Administration) that a total elimination of the oil would have no effect on the 
problem of excessive saturated fats in the American diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle for Market Share 
</P>
<P>
In response to the new Malaysian campaign, the soybean group, which represents 
U. S. soybean farmers, hastily convened reporters Wednesday to complain that 
the reputation of its members "has been grossly maligned by foreign interests." 
Highlighting the "foreign funding" of the palm oil exporters campaign, James 
Lee Adams, a Georgia farmer who is president of the soybean association, said 
the Malaysian industry "is making a desperate effort to save its U.S. market." 
</P>
<P>
Although the soybean association said its initial campaign was to highlight a 
health issue, this controversy has all the markings of a simple battle for 
market share. In this case, at issue is who gets what share of a U.S. vegetable 
oil market worth more than $1 billion a year. Tropical oils are relatively new 
to the U.S. market -- and never gained significant market share -- but as 
imports of palm oil in the United States increased rapidly in the early 1980s, 
the soybean association seized upon the saturated fat content of tropical oils. 
Phipps said the association sent "fat fighter" kits to soybean farmers accusing 
tropical oil importers of trying to put American farmers out of business. At 
the urging of the association, a letter-writing campaign to legislators and 
food manufacturers was begun, Phipps said, complaining that the campaign's 
misleading claims contributed to a drop in palm oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
In defending its campaign, the soybean association said Wednesday that it 
provided information only to its members and did not go directly to consumers 
as the Malaysian campaign has. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean growers also tried to get federal legislation that would require 
labeling of tropical oils as saturated fats. But the Food and Drug 
Administration, citing the small amount of tropical oils in the American diet, 
testified against singling out the oils. Supporters of tropical oils argue that 
the more widespread use of hydrogenated soybean oil is more of a contributor to 
the saturated fat problem in the United States than tropical oils. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a battle between the soybean manufacturers and the Malaysian 
government," said Dr. David Heber, an associate professor of clinical nutrition 
at the UCLA School of Medicine. "From a public health standpoint, this is a 
tempest in a teapot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Hidden Fat 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Heber said, the fuss loses sight of the real issue, which is that 
Americans consume too many calories and particularly too many calories from fat 
of all kinds. Consumers exposed to these campaigns should keep in mind that the 
healthiest choice is to reduce total oil consumption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooking oils are the No. 1 one source of hidden fat in the American diet. . . 
. Increased fat and calories contribute to the risk of heart disease and many 
forms of cancer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Criticisms of tropical oils gained widespread publicity late last year after 
the Heart Savers, organized by a wealthy Omaha businessman, sponsored a series 
of newspaper ads accusing food manufacturers of "poisoning America" by using 
tropical oils in their food formulas. The American Council on Science &amp; 
Health denounced the ads as "a disservice to the American consumer." But 
several food manufacturers responded swiftly to the ads in announcing that they 
would remove tropical oils as well as animal fats such as lard from their 
formulas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Wednesday if its concern was the health of the American public, why it 
did not also campaign against lard at the same time it criticized tropical 
oils, soybean association officials responded that many of the association 
members are livestock producers. "I don't think any organization would work 
against its own industry," Adams said.

STANTON ADULT BOOKSTORE LAW OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanton's longstanding crusade to rub out the only adult bookstore in town 
sputtered to a halt Wednesday after a state appellate court found an ordinance 
regulating the business to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana leaves EarMark 
Books, owned by Ginger Cox, safely ensconced in a shopping center on Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The store sells sexually explicit books, magazines, toys and videotapes, and 
houses a video arcade. It has been the site of hundreds of protests supported 
by Protestant and Catholic clergy and the target of at least three attempts by 
the Stanton City Council to force it out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to live with them now," conceded City Atty. Thomas Allen. "That's the 
bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton's 1985 ordinance limited adult bookstores to areas zoned for commercial 
activities and banned any within 500 feet of schools, churches or residential 
areas, or within 1,000 feet of another adult establishment. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, such restrictions have been found not to violate constitutionally 
guaranteed free speech rights. But in the Stanton case, the court agreed with a 
trial judge's earlier decision that the ordinance wrongly banned such 
businesses from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanton can point to a total of only six sites where, regardless of 
availability, Cox could locate her business," the appellate court opinion says. 
Each was already occupied by another business. 
</P>
<P>
"We videotaped those (six) locations and showed the judge that the places were 
totally inappropriate," said Roger Jon Diamond, a lawyer for Cox known for 
defending bookstores in free-speech cases. "One, for instance, was already 
occupied by a big warehouse, another by a service station. 
</P>
<P>
"When you try to apply these (distance) restrictions to a small city, 
frequently what happens is that there is no place for you to go," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel found it particularly troublesome that Stanton had 
attempted to use the ordinance to assure that no red-light district could 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinances with a requirement that adult businesses be separated by a specific 
distance from other such businesses have frequently failed to pass 
constitutional muster if the end result leaves little opportunity for the 
businesses to operate," the opinion says. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton's 4-year-old drive against the bookstore at 11422 Beach Blvd. was noted 
in the opinion. Shortly before the city filed suit seeking to shut down 
EarMark, the council passed another ordinance on an emergency basis 
specifically attacking the 15 enclosed video booths in the store. Then, shortly 
before the trial, the council -- again on an emergency basis -- decided to 
slightly ease restrictions on where the shop could move. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate judges characterized the council maneuvers as a "Keystone Cop 
legislative chase of Cox's sex shop." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Diamond hailed the decision as a victory for free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities such as Stanton may not, under the guise of adult zoning ordinances, 
totally ban adult bookstores and arcades," Diamond said. "In the abstract, 
cities have a right to adopt such ordinances. But the practical effect may not 
be to totally prohibit or to unduly restrict where these businesses may be 
located." 
</P>
<P>
At the store Wednesday, a clerk said it was business as usual. Cox was out of 
town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, the city may yet challenge some of the attractions in the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he believes that the portion of the city ordinance banning enclosed 
booths where sexually explicit videos are shown is valid. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least 15 booths with coin-operated machines," Allen said. "The 
patron has the ability to select between several different sexually explicit, 
X-rated films. He can lock the door and have total privacy."

JAIL DOUBLE-BUNK PLAN HAS HITCH: NO GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Orange County finally has approval from the state to bunk two inmates 
instead of one in each cell of a new jail facility in Santa Ana, officials say 
they don't have the money for additional guards needed to watch the extra 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has created a paradox in which more than 200 jail beds -- ready 
to be filled -- will remain empty even though officials say overcrowding 
continues to force the release of more than a hundred suspected or convicted 
criminals a day who would otherwise be incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
"We can ask the sheriff to take it out of his hide," Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley joked out of frustration. "It just does something to 
you when you have these people who have been found guilty of crimes and you 
can't keep them in jail because you don't have the (guards) the state says you 
have to have." 
</P>
<P>
Adding a second bunk to newly constructed jail cells is normally a violation of 
state Board of Corrections regulations. But last week the board voted to help 
relieve Orange County's serious jail overcrowding problem by not penalizing the 
county for so-called "double bunking" in 216 of the 384 cells at the new 
Intake-Release Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
At the Board of Corrections meeting in Sacramento, Orange County Sheriff's 
Department officials said they would need 14 more deputies to guard the extra 
prisoners. So the board made the added deputies a condition of its approval. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Associate County Administrative Officer John Sibley said, officials 
are studying whether they could safely staff the Intake-Release Center, 
double-bunked, with fewer added guards. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Lammers, executive director of the Board of Corrections, said that that 
could be a violation of the board's order and that it might expose the county 
to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an odd aspect to the state's regulations: The Board of Corrections 
only has authority to penalize a county while the jail in question is under 
construction. Technically, the construction contract for the Intake-Release 
Center expires in April, even though it has been open since early last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In actuality, they (county officials) can go ahead and wait until the end of 
the contract and our orders go back to being advisory," Lammers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said county officials are considering just that. "I would agree that 
that is an option," he said. "I would not call it a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Jerry Krans, who made the recommendation for 14 new deputies, 
said he has not studied whether the Santa Ana facility could be safely staffed 
with fewer guards. If the 14 guards are not hired, he said, it is possible that 
the Sheriff's Department would only fill some of the extra bunks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concerns Expressed 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to do anything that sacrifices safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McLeod, general manager of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, 
said he has not heard deputies express any safety concerns about the proposed 
double bunking. 
</P>
<P>
But the Board of Corrections has heard a complaint from Dick Herman, a 
volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Herman has 
previously sued the county over jail conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Double bunking 'on the cheap' will necessarily lead to prisoner-to-prisoner 
violence which single cells were intended to eliminate," Herman wrote in a 
letter to the state board. "The increase in assaults, homosexual rape, death 
and disease which stems from double bunking requires significantly more staff 
and facilities than a single cell jail." 
</P>
<P>
The county's existing maximum-security jail, next to the new Intake-Release 
Center, already has double bunking. 
</P>
<P>
Lammers said the state's requirement for single cells is intended to protect 
vulnerable inmates -- such as young or mentally disturbed people -- from the 
prison population and to isolate inmates known to be excessively violent. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has had a seriously overcrowded jail system for more than 10 
years. The Board of Corrections has rated its capacity at about 3,000 inmates, 
but it now houses more than 4,000 on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Least Dangerous' Released 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Krans said that last year 43,675 suspected or convicted criminals 
were either turned away from the jail or given an early release to ease the 
overcrowding. Those who were turned away were mostly charged with misdemeanor 
crimes, he said. Some who were released before completing their complete 
sentences, however, were convicted of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Krans said the department attempts to release the "least dangerous" criminals. 
But he added that some have been arrested for new crimes that they wouldn't 
have been able to commit had they remained in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 14 requested deputies, sheriff's officials told the Board of 
Corrections that they would need 16 more clerical staff workers to process the 
additional inmates. The total annual cost for those new positions was estimated 
at $1.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, however, Orange County was facing a $23-million budget 
shortfall that had threatened the jobs of more than 1,200 county employees. 
County officials managed to avert the layoffs and balance the budget with 
several belt-tightening measures and new funds from the state. But the budget 
remains very tight for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said county officials are checking for money they could use to pay for 
additional deputies. But he said no funds have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got options," he said. "We've just got to figure out what we're going to 
do."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MAYOR ARRESTED IN PROSTITUTE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL and NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fountain Valley Mayor Frederick Warren Voss has been arrested on suspicion of 
soliciting sex from an undercover policewoman posing as a prostitute in Santa 
Ana, police said Wednesday. But Voss' attorney said his client committed no 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, 52, a telephone-systems manager for the county, would not discuss the 
arrest when contacted by telephone at work Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm referring everything to my attorney," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police officers conducting a continuing undercover operation along 
Harbor Boulevard arrested Voss about 9 p.m. Monday after he allegedly solicited 
sex from the officer, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time mayor -- a divorced father of two sons -- was taken to the Santa 
Ana police station and issued a citation for solicitation, which is a 
misdemeanor, Thomas said. She added that Voss was never jailed and that he was 
released without bail pending a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Voss did not reveal his occupation at the time of his arrest, and Thomas said 
that officers only learned the next day that he was the mayor of the central 
Orange County city of about 58,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officers patrolling Harbor are not in uniform, the undercover 
operation has been highly publicized in recent weeks as scores of prostitutes 
and their alleged customers have been arrested by police trying to rid the 
major thoroughfare of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty for a first-time, misdemeanor solicitation conviction is $500 and 
probation, according to Santa Ana Police Cpl. Steve Gales. 
</P>
<P>
Police would reveal few details of the arrest other than to say that Voss was 
among 16 men arrested during the prostitution sting, which on Monday night 
targeted "customers," Thomas said. Voss allegedly approached the "prostitute" 
near the intersection of Washington Boulevard, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Whaling, an El Toro attorney representing Voss, said his client has not 
yet been charged by the Orange County district attorney's office. He issued a 
brief statement late Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Voss is not guilty of any criminal activity. He does not believe that it 
is beneficial to try this case in the press, especially in view of Santa Ana's 
(prostitution) problems." 
</P>
<P>
Voss, who has worked in the aerospace industry, has for years been employed by 
the county's General Services Agency. He was divorced in 1985 from Sara-Alice 
Voss, 52, a former legal secretary now working as a fiber artist, court and 
city clerk records show. The divorce records contained no recriminations 
against either party. 
</P>
<P>
Sara-Alice Voss could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Citing irreconcilable differences, Fred Voss filed for the divorce in June, 
1983. The couple were married in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and colleagues say the Vosses have two sons. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Allan Burns is researching the question of whether Voss can legally 
continue serving as a councilman while his case is being decided in court, 
Fountain Valley city spokesman Don Heinbuch said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into that question as we speak," he said. "Frankly, we don't as 
of yet have the answer. We hope to be able to answer that within the next 
couple of days." Burns could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
News of Voss' arrest was met with shock and a reluctance to speak in the 
predominantly residential city of Fountain Valley, where City Council members 
are usually friends and where the biggest controversy in years was over a 
shopping center development. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George B. Scott said it was too early to issue any "judgment calls" 
about his colleague's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred and I have been close friends for nearly 20 years," Scott said. "There's 
no way I'm going to condemn him. . . . I don't think that we have all the 
facts. I do know that he's done an outstanding job for the city. He is, and 
will continue to be, a real asset to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Council members James Neal and Laurann Cook both declined comment Wednesday. 
Councilman James D. Petrikin could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
But James Dick, a member of the Fountain Valley Housing and Community 
Development Board and a 24-year resident, said of Voss' arrest: "I think that 
it shows a real lack of judgment on his part to go anywhere near that area. 
</P>
<P>
"My gosh, the Police Department has been rounding them up on that street for 
the past 3 months!" Dick added. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, considered by some city observers to be a pro-development conservative, 
has a long-established record of service to the community. Before his election 
to the council, he served for a term as president of the city's school board 
and as coach of youth sports for the city's recreation program. 
</P>
<P>
His occasionally brusque manner during council meetings has at times distanced 
Voss from other members. He has also been the lone dissenter on past 
controversies before the council. 
</P>
<P>
Voss was first elected in 1982, then reelected to the council 2 years later. In 
the second election, he won the highest number of votes in the city's history. 
He first served in the largely ceremonial position of mayor in 1986, assuming 
it again last December. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the important thing is not to rush to judgment on this. . . . We 
don't know what all the facts are," said John J. Collins, president of the 
Fountain Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that he has been a real friend to business in the city and his 
performance as a community leader has been unequaled in my opinion," Collins 
continued. "I don't think that we should bury the guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was a bad decision. . . . But I ask you -- does one bad decision kill 
the golden goose?" he said.

5 SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five suspected gang members were arrested on suspicion of attempted assault 
with a deadly weapon and possession of a dangerous weapon after two of them 
allegedly threatened to kill a Cypress College student on campus Wednesday 
afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the student, a former member of another gang, was threatened 
in retaliation for an earlier dispute between the two unnamed gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador McWilliam, 20, of Anaheim, Jeff Lauricio, 22, of Santa Ana, and Ariel 
Carigma and Randall Bauda, both 19 and from Garden Grove, were being held at 
County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail each, Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old Garden Grove boy, who was not identified because of his age, was 
being held at Juvenile Hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old student allegedly threatened was not identified by police to 
protect him from further retaliation, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schaefer, Cypress College security officers and Cypress police 
were summoned to the college at 1:15 p.m. The student claimed that Bauda and 
McWilliam threatened to kill him with a knife and homemade gun, Schaefer said. 
He said the suspects fled before anything happened. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, a college security officer saw the license plate on the 
suspects' car as it drove away. Westminster police spotted the car at Locust 
and Maple streets in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered three homemade guns, a knife and several billy clubs from the 
vehicle, Schaefer said.

<P>
SAVING THREATENED BIRDS FROM FOXES TO BE TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Protection of two endangered bird species against red foxes in the Seal Beach 
Naval Weapons Station will be discussed at a public meeting this evening in the 
City Council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy are sponsoring the meeting to 
gather public comment for a planned environmental impact statement on 
protections needed for the California least tern and the light-footed clapper 
rail, which nest in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge located on the 
military base. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to control non-native red foxes that roam the wildlife refuge, said 
Tracey Schwarze, public affairs officer for the station. Wildlife experts 
contend that foxes prey on the birds, which nest on the ground in the salt 
marsh, and are seriously depleting the fowl population. That led to a 
controversial program to trap the foxes in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the trapping program was challenged in court by an animal-rights group, the 
Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. Federal judges have refused to halt the trapping 
but have asked the Navy to draft an environmental impact statement on 
protection efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarze said there currently is no trapping under way in the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Other efforts to protect the birds have included an electric fence around the 
tern nesting area and nesting platforms for the clapper rails. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. in the council chambers, located at 211 8th 
St. 
</P>
<P>
Written comments will be accepted through Feb. 15. The environmental impact 
statement is expected to be completed in December.

FATHER TESTIFIES IN MOLESTATION HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Irvine pastor testified Wednesday that he met twice with a Newport 
Beach neurosurgeon for an explanation of treatments on his daughter, then 12, 
that allegedly involved regular pelvic examinations and photographing of her 
genitals. 
</P>
<P>
The father, who headed a Baptist church in Irvine, testified that he met with 
Dr. Francis J. Williams, 64, after church one Sunday in 1985 to discuss his 
daughter's reports that the examinations and photographs did not seem right. 
</P>
<P>
"She was having feelings that she shouldn't be examined like she was . . . the 
postures she was asked to assume," the father said during the second day of 
Williams' preliminary hearing on charges that he sexually molested the girl and 
another female patient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 Visits to Office 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, now 16, testified Tuesday that she was asked to kneel nude on 
the table while the doctor examined her from behind. The incident allegedly 
occurred during one of about 15 visits to Williams' Newport Beach office in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's father testified Wednesday in Municipal Court in Newport Beach that 
Williams had explained the treatment in "medical terms I didn't understand," 
adding that the pictures were taken because "his medical books were old and 
outdated and he'd rather use (the pictures) to show her things." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Williams have said the pictures were used to explain hygiene to 
the girl, who now lives in Lexington, Ky., with her father and mother. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was a member of the pastor's congregation, had hired the girl's 
mother as an office assistant and was treating the daughter for a learning 
disability, as well as giving money to the family as a favor, said Williams' 
attorney, Byron K. McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was arrested in November and charged with molestation after the girl 
told doctors in Kentucky of the alleged molestation during a counseling session 
for an attempted suicide by drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
The second alleged victim testified Wednesday that she did not come forward 
until she saw television news reports about Williams' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old woman, under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kelly McEachern, 
said Williams gave her a pelvic examination last January after she was referred 
to him by her doctor for consultation about back and leg pain. The woman said 
she asked Williams at the time why a pelvic exam was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"He said there were just some nerves he wanted to test to see if there was a 
reaction," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not consider notifying authorities about the exam until she 
saw Williams on television in connection with the alleged molestation of the 
Irvine girl. She contacted her doctor, who told her that a pelvic exam had not 
been listed in notes on the case forwarded to him by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The defense countered with testimony from Williams' longtime associate, 
gynecologist Johnnie Betson Jr. Betson said he and Williams created and had 
used a technique that treated back problems by removing a spinal disk by way of 
the abdominal area. He said a pelvic exam could be necessary in the woman's 
case in preparation for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Defense questioning also revealed that the teen-ager's father had been arrested 
in January, 1985, by a Newport Beach police officer posing as a prostitute on 
Harbor Boulevard. That information was introduced to suggest that the girl's 
emotional problems could have stemmed from family problems. The girl's father 
testified Wednesday that he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disturbing 
the peace in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Susanna S. Shaw is expected to decide today whether there is 
sufficient evidence to try Williams on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Williams could face 20 years in state prison, MacEachern said.

BILL WHITE WOULD BE A GOOD MAN FOR THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This business of Bill White suddenly becoming the leading candidate to be 
president of the National League is like Kremlin-watching or studying who stood 
next to Mao at the May Day parade. The only thing we know for sure is that the 
job of president of the league is coming open soon. 
</P>
<P>
The National League has always found a man to fill the job. Seldom has he had 
real impact because the owners still run the game and league presidents operate 
with the owners holding the reins. The issue has taken on this air of mystery 
because the search committee has fixed on hiring a black man, who would be the 
first black ever to head a professional sports league. Baseball would look 
terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ueberroth is stepping out as commissioner of baseball and Bart Giamatti 
is stepping up from the National League. That's fact. The rest is leaked from a 
search committee that has maintained a posture of being unusually close-mouthed 
for a baseball group. 
</P>
<P>
Naming a black man president of the league wouldn't mean that baseball had 
completed its obligation to hiring minorities, but it would be a visible and 
necessary public step. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the prime candidates all were white, and that, considering 
baseball's eagerness to appear more sensitive to the issues of the time, was 
decided to be unsatisfactory. Then two other men who had strong administrative 
credentials, and were black, took the lead, which seemed to suit the definition 
that the lords of baseball had in mind. But the names of Simon Gourdine and 
Gilroye Griffin, however strong their qualifications, stirred little public 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
After months of committee study, Bill White appears to have taken the lead. One 
of the candidates speculated Tuesday that White's baseball background has put 
him into the lead. White is a former star player, and he has broadcast Yankee 
games since 1971. He is a bright, articulate man. The public knows him. That is 
a very strong qualification. 
</P>
<P>
People on baseball search committees have in the past set out trial balloons to 
see what kind of reaction they get. Bill White, who was in Los Angeles and 
unavailable for comment, may be such a trial balloon. He has been interviewed 
by Peter O'Malley, the kingmaker son of the late kingmaker Walter O'Malley. 
Tuesday, it was reported that White would most likely be offered the job this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball officially denies having decided any such thing. "We're not confirming 
or denying any of the speculation that's been going on out there," O'Malley, 
president of the Los Angeles Dodgers and chairman of the search committee, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Wilpon, president of the New York Mets and another member of the search 
committee, would say only that "quite a few candidates" had been interviewed, 
"all of them very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
White is an impressive guy. He is a graduate of Hiram College in Ohio. He was 
always a man of substance on his ballclub and a man who would deal with thorny 
issues, racial or otherwise. During his time as a Yankees broadcaster, he was 
clever enough to have turned down owner George Steinbrenner's offer to be a 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
But what are the qualifications for the job? Clifford Alexander, the Washington 
attorney heading the search committee, won't even offer a job definition 
"because you could infer who was being considered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Or are any real qualifications necessary? Gourdine was deputy commissioner of 
the National Basketball Association before his present job as head of labor 
relations for the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin is vice president for labor relations for Bristol-Myers. Baseball is 
scheduled for very thorny labor-management negotiations in 1990, and the input 
of people with labor experience would seem valuable. But the appearance of 
White's name at this date suggests that's not what the search committee is 
searching for. 
</P>
<P>
The league president has three substantive tasks: controlling the umpires, 
overseeing the schedule and disciplining players. Then he kisses babies and 
entertains visiting dignitaries. He does what the owners permit him to do -- 
kind of like the vice president of the United States. If the job is largely 
that of a figurehead, a black man is entitled to be a figurehead, too. 
</P>
<P>
The league president also has been a member of the Player Relations Committee, 
which will do the heavy work in negotiations. But they've never been active 
participants. Lee MacPhail became a factor after he retired as American League 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Now baseball has created a new position of deputy commissioner for business 
affairs to work with Giamatti. The deputy is Francis Vincent, a Washington 
lawyer formerly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and with Columbia 
Pictures. And there is a second lawyer, Chuck O'Connor, now on the Player 
Relations Committee with Barry Rona. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, executive director of the players association, notes that it has been 
easier to work with American League President Bobby Brown, because he had a 
player's understanding of the weight of the schedule and the size of the strike 
zone. Former National League president Chub Feeney was more fixed on baseball 
as it used to be, which was his background. MacPhail could disagree without 
being disagreeable. 
</P>
<P>
White would bring ideas that might be closer to the real life of 1990. "But the 
league president has made no difference at all in negotiations," Marvin Miller, 
former director of the players association, said. "The commissioner has never 
been that important to labor negotiations, either."

WHITE APPARENTLY LEFT UNPROTECTED BY RAMS IN NFL FREE AGENCY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Charles White of the Rams reportedly is 1 of 600 National Football 
League players made free agents this week in the plan imposed by club owners. 
</P>
<P>
Each team was allowed to protect 37 players of the average of 59 on the regular 
rosters and various reserve lists. 
</P>
<P>
While the lists were not expected to be officially released until today, early 
reports from players and agents confirmed what team officials have been saying 
-- that long-time starters and even All-Pros might be unprotected in favor of 
young unknowns with potential who might be grabbed by sharp personnel 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Redskins, for example, left available 10 players who were 
regulars last season as they fell from Super Bowl champion to 7-9. They include 
38-year-old defensive tackle Dave Butz, middle linebacker Neal Olkewicz, free 
safety Todd Bowles, center Jeff Bostic and Russ Grimm, a three-time All-Pro 
offensive lineman who will turn 30 on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand why they're doing this but it kind of hurts your ego a little 
bit," said Grimm, who makes $450,000 a year. "Will I look around? I don't think 
I'll look that hard but if the phone rings I'll answer it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time the Redskins protected cornerback Carl Mims, linebacker Brian 
Bonner and running back Willard Reaves, all rookies who spent last season on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm worried about it," Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said. "I've talked to 
each one we left unprotected and tried to explain it. I wish it wasn't just 
37." 
</P>
<P>
Others left unprotected include 36-year-old defensive tackle Randy White of 
Dallas; Seattle's 34-year-old Steve Largent, the league's all-time leading 
receiver; and one-time Pro Bowl linebacker E.J. Junior of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL Management Council, which devised the plan, is optimistic it can 
convince Judge David Doty, who is presiding in the antitrust suit filed by the 
union after the 1987 strike, that there is freedom of movement for players. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a ton of players out there," council spokesman John Jones said. "There 
are some with several productive years ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
The system is an outgrowth of that 24-day 1987 strike, which ended with an 
antitrust suit filed by the NFL Players Assn., asking the courts to grant it 
the free agency it couldn't get on the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the players union, said Wednesday that the 
two sides negotiated on Super Bowl Sunday, trying to reach a contract before 
the free agency system was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw said that at one point management negotiators offered unconditional free 
agency for all players after 7 years, 1 more than the union is seeking. When he 
countered with 5 years, Upshaw said, the owners toughened their offer to 8 
years for wide receivers and running backs, 10 for linemen and linebackers and 
12 for quarterbacks, punters and kickers. 
</P>
<P>
"In no other sport is free agency based on what you've done," he said. "In 
baseball, a guy who hits 50 home runs can't be protected, and in basketball, a 
guy who scores 30 points a game can become a unconditional free agent at some 
point, if he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the free agents are under contract. If they don't receive an offer by 
April 1, they revert back to their old teams under terms of the old contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Some unprotected players understood their positions; others had their feelings 
bruised; others were philosophic, like like 29-year-old Billy Ard, a starting 
guard for the New York Giants who said he would be interested in offers that 
might bring him more than the $300,000 he currently makes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give it much significance," said Bradley Peter, agent for wide 
receiver Wesley Walker of the New York Jets, a former All-Pro who was left 
unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was 28 years old and left unprotected, I think we'd have his house up 
for sale. At 33, realistically it's a business decision. We have been given 
assurances it's not a reflection on their interest in Wesley for 1989 and we 
understand and respect it for what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants also left unprotected nose tackle Jim Burt, wide receivers Stacy 
Robinson and Phil McConkey, strong safety Kenny Hill, running back Ottis 
Anderson and backup quarterback Jeff Rutledge while protecting rookie defensive 
back Sammy Lilly.

SAVANNA OVERCOMES BIG DEFICIT AND BREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, one good quarter is enough to win a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna High School proved the point Wednesday night in a 56-55 victory over 
Brea-Olinda that moved the Rebels into great position to win their second 
straight Orange League title. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna (20-2, 6-1) scored 24 points in the final quarter and overcame a 
10-point deficit to move a game ahead of Brea-Olinda (16-7, 5-2) and Western 
(15-5, 5-2) with three games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Savanna has completed play against Brea and Western, meaning the 
Rebels will finish against three teams with losing records. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll win the league, they've got too much momentum going now," said Rick 
Jones, Brea's coach. "We're fighting for the playoffs now." 
</P>
<P>
Brea appeared to have the game neatly tucked away when Savanna caught fire. 
Savanna scored 14 consecutive points in the fourth quarter to take a 46-42 lead 
and then survived some anxious moments in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Rodney Stewart had an opportunity to give Brea the lead with 5 seconds 
remaining when he was fouled with his team trailing, 56-55. But Stewart missed 
both free throws, and Brea couldn't capitalize on a last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was returning following a knee injury that had forced him to miss eight 
games. He missed four free throws and cost Brea a chance of tying the score, 
66-66, with 58 seconds remaining when he was cited for a lane violation just 
before Keith Walker made a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his first game back, but he should have made one of the free throws," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Free throws -- or the lack of them -- had played a big part in the game through 
three quarters. Brea had made 12 of 19 attempts going into the last quarter 
while Savanna had attempted only three and made one. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna wasn't much better from the field, making only 15 of 42 shots, but all 
that changed in the final quarter. Guard Aaron Calderon gave the Rebels their 
first lead, 45-44, with 4:42 remaining when he drove the lane for a short jump 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna followed Calderon's lead, making 7 of 12 shots in the quarter, nearly 
matching its point production through three quarters in the final 8 minutes of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We played good defense, and eventually our offense got going," said Tom 
Gregory, Savanna coach. "I was disappointed in our level of play for three 
quarters. We didn't play hard or smart." 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia 61, Valencia 56 -- Visiting Magnolia rallied from a 17-6 first-quarter 
deficit to win. Jerry Jones had 18 points and Ronny McKee 17 for Magnolia 
(10-9, 4-3). Paul Diamond had a game-high 21 points and Steve Dodd added 12 for 
Valencia (4-12, 1-6). 
</P>
<P>
Western 89, Anaheim 57 -- Forward Joe Romero scored 21 of his game-high 33 
points in the first half as Western opened a 45-27 lead and cruised. Teammate 
Sam Sabbara added 19 points and 12 assists for the winners.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bryant McLemore made 2 free throws with 14 seconds left to give Woodbridge High 
School a 78-74 victory over Laguna Hills in a Pacific Coast league basketball 
game Wednesday at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves Woodbridge (7-10 overall, 5-2 in league play) into a tie with 
Laguna Hills (13-7, 5-2) for second place. Both teams trail Trabuco Hills by 2 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge led, 37-34, at halftime, then outscored the Hawks, 19-8, in the 
third quarter for a 56-42. Joey Cohen scored 7 of his team-high 22 points in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills cut the deficit to 76-74 with less than a minute left on a jump 
shot by Pat Neslon, who scored 9 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 55, Orange 46 -- The Artists (8-11, 2-5) trailed going into the 
fourth quarter, but outscored host Orange, 26-15, in the fourth quarter. Dain 
Blanton scored 18 points and John Trevino 17 for Laguna Beach. Rob Salinger 
scored 11 points for Orange (3-14, 1-6).

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER;

<P>
FLORENTINE REALIZES WINNING ISN'T THE ONLY THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Weyler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Florentine figures he's an expert of sorts on sports psychology . . . at 
least if firsthand knowledge counts for anything. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Florentine has experienced his own emotional version of the 
Wide World of Sports. And he has discovered the agony of victory and the joy of 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The agony of victory: Last season, Florentine was a forward on the UC Irvine 
basketball team. He appeared in 22 of 30 games and started five conference 
games. Florentine, a 6-foot-6 sophomore, was a designated defensive player and 
he drew more than a few difficult assignments, such as: Stop Brian Shaw. Stop 
Ricky Berry. Stop Gerald Paddio. 
</P>
<P>
He was moderately successful in that role -- of course, he might have been the 
defense-weak Anteaters' best defender this season -- and he averaged two points 
and a rebound per game. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan admired Florentine's athletic talents, but he questioned 
his dedication and was angered by his concentration lapses on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was doing a pretty good job," Florentine said, "but Mulligan was 
almost more concerned about what you were doing off the court than on the 
court. I couldn't understand why he benched me near the end of the season. It 
was head games and more head games." 
</P>
<P>
Before the conference tournament began, Mulligan held a lengthy team meeting on 
a Sunday afternoon. He had decided that 10 players would be in uniform for the 
tournament. There were 11 players at the meeting. Florentine was the odd man 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Florentine was openly upset and Mulligan threw him out of the meeting and off 
the team. Later, Mulligan said Florentine had been suspended for attitude 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a bad team meeting," Mulligan explained. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine upset Nevada Las Vegas in the semifinals and lost a lead in the second 
half of the tournament final to Utah State. The Anteaters were a few minutes 
shy of a spot in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Florentine didn't get to share in the glory, fleeting as it was. He had to buy 
a ticket to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Florentine could have been a good player if he had worked at improving," 
Mulligan said, "but all he wanted to do was go to the beach, play volleyball 
and pick up girls." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan certainly was right about that. 
</P>
<P>
The joy of defeat: Florentine did not play volleyball at Redondo (Beach) Union 
High School, but his reputation as a beach player was enough that Bill Ashen, 
the Irvine volleyball coach, had asked him to come out for the team, even if it 
meant just playing in the last few matches after the basketball season ended. 
</P>
<P>
So, instead of transferring and playing basketball somewhere else, Florentine 
changed uniforms instead of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's men's volleyball team is a member of the Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn., along with most of the best teams in the country. The 
Anteaters don't win often -- they're 0-2 so far -- but, boy, do they have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definite underdogs in the WIVA," Florentine said. "Sometimes we'll be 
getting totally worked, just pounded, but everyone is having a great time, 
kidding each other, making the best of it, enjoying the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a college sport so relaxed. I look forward to volleyball 
practice. I used to dread basketball practice, but this is a much more 
comfortable environment." 
</P>
<P>
Ashen is glad Florentine feels at home because his presence at middle blocker 
has elevated the team to a new level. Even though the Anteaters are on the 
bottom of the WIVA totem pole, they are ranked No. 18 in the national poll. 
</P>
<P>
"His footwork is a nightmare," Ashen said, laughing, "and he sometimes knocks 
our outside hitter into the bleachers while making a block, but the point is he 
makes the block. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot to learn about positioning, but what he doesn't know he makes up 
for in athletic ability and instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Florentine admits he may not be the fastest learner around, but he's making 
progress under Ashen's low-key guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Ashen doesn't get frustrated," Florentine said. "He's calm and patient 
and he doesn't mind telling you something over and over." 
</P>
<P>
So Florentine has been transformed from a forgotten forward in one sport to the 
center of attention in another. 
</P>
<P>
"With Steve in there, we block a whole lot better as a team and that's the 
quickest way to get points," captain Dave Pettker said. "We may not be real 
competitive in the WIVA yet, but we're not horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Florentine's future might be on the beach, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"With a couple of years of sand under his belt, he could make an impact on the 
pro tour," Ashen said. "He's got the talent." 
</P>
<P>
Florentine's beach volleyball experience so far has been limited to playing 
with a friend -- instead of a highly skilled player -- as a partner. Still, he 
has had some success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to pursue it," he said. "I'm going to go all out this 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
The key to making a living playing beach volleyball is securing a sponsor. 
Florentine's blond, beach-boy good looks can't hurt in that department. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting kicked off the basketball team was a blessing in disguise," he said, 
smiling. "Basketball wasn't going to take me anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan had a question for his team this week: 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think (Cal State Long Beach guard) Walker Moore is playing instead 
of (second-leading scorer) Darrell Faulkner?" 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan thinks he knows. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Moore throws the ball to (No. 1 scorer, center John) Hatten." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan hoped the analogy would sink in, but just in case it didn't, he made 
his point clear. 
</P>
<P>
"That could happen to a couple of our guys real soon," he said. "(Guard) Kevin 
Floyd is shooting 40% in conference games. (Guard) Rod Palmer is shooting 38%. 
Doesn't it make sense that (center) Mike Doktorczyk, who's shooting 58%, should 
be taking more shots than Floyd and Palmer?" 
</P>
<P>
Floyd has taken 102 shots in Big West Conference play and Palmer 106. And 
Palmer is 14 of 46 on 3-pointers in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk is second in the nation in 3-point field-goal percentage (.587) and 
is shooting 58% from the floor. He has attempted 79 shots in Big West action. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a rule when I had (Kevin) Magee," Mulligan said. "It was, 'Throw the 
ball to Magee or come sit with me.' We may start something like that again." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan pointed out that there's one good thing about Irvine's 
basketball schedule this season: The Anteaters, who will take a bus to Fresno 
and Stockton for their last two road games, have no more airplane trips. An 
optimist might point out that there's a chance for another air excursion if the 
Anteaters win the Big West tournament and the automatic NCAA berth. Mulligan: 
"Like I said, no more plane trips." . . . Opposing inside players have been 
scoring with relative ease against the Anteaters recently. When asked who would 
guard Cal State Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos tonight (who is averaging 21 points 
a game), Mulligan said, "I don't have anyone who can guard Ceballos. Hell, I 
don't have anyone who can guard (Irvine sports information director) Bob 
Olsen." 
</P>
<P>
Kris Roberts was named outstanding player of the year and Ali Wood was honored 
as most improved at the women's volleyball annual banquet. Roberts, who set six 
school records this season, and Wood tied for the school record with 381 kills 
this season. . . . Freshman Ken Cooper won the 100-meter breaststroke, the 200 
breaststroke and the 200 individual medley to lead the Anteater men's swimming 
team over Pomona-Pitzer Saturday.

Sophomore forward Markus Muller-Stach scored 15 of his game-high 21 points in 
the second half to lead Golden West College to a 76-67 victory over Orange 
Coast Wednesday in an Orange Empire Conference men's basketball game in front 
of about 250 at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast led, 32-31, at the half, but Golden West and Muller-Stach took 
control almost as soon as the second half started. He scored on 2 short jumpers 
to give Golden West a 35-34 lead. Muller-Stach was 5 of 7 from the field in the 
second half and 8 of 13 in the game. He was also 4 for 4 on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West opened a 44-37 lead on a free throw by Carl Champion with 16:02 
left only to have OCC's Derek Johnson hit a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 44-40 
20 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West took over from there, going on a 10-0 run that included 2 
baskets by Champion, who had 9 points off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played really hard," Golden West Coach Jim Greenfield said. "We've 
been playing hard all along and sometimes the breaks didn't go our way. Now, 
it's our turn to get a roll or two." 
</P>
<P>
The loss hurt OCC (19-7 overall, 4-3 in conference play) in the conference 
title chase. Riverside (22-8, 7-1) defeated Saddleback, 66-50, Wednesday. 
Cypress upset Rancho Santiago, 89-81, also Wednesday, but the Dons (15-9, 5-3) 
still remain in second place, 2 games behind Riverside. OCC is in third. Golden 
West (18-9, 3-5) is in fifth behind Cypress (12-13, 4-4). 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams in the conference get automatic berths into the state 
playoffs, which start Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West lost 4 of 6 games in the first round of conference play, including 
a 1-point loss to Riverside and a 2-point loss to OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West's Kevin Anderson had 10 points. OCC's Dareck Crane scored 14 of his 
team-high 18 in the second half. Johnson had 10 and LaMont Speed had 12.

<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference men's games:

Cypress 89, Rancho Santiago 81 -- Rancho Santiago led by 11 at one time in each 
half, but Cypress took the lead for good on a rebound basket by Andre Lamoureux 
with 8 minutes left. Lamoureux, a freshman forward, scored a game-high 22 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Reid had 16 points and Mike Varos 14 for Cypress. Chris Martin scored 15 
points and John Guerrero 12 for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The game was marred by fouls, 38 called on Rancho Santiago and 29 on Cypress. 
Cypress was 37 of 50 from the free-throw line and Rancho Santiago was 26 of 35. 
Rancho Santiago led, 40-34, at the half and built it up to, 58-47, on a basket 
by Tony Smalley with 13:30 left before Cypress started to rally. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 66, Saddleback 50 -- Saddleback cut the lead to 47-44 on a 3-pointer 
by Wun Versher with 8 minutes left but Riverside went on an 11-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Bradd Heckman scored 13 and Vincent Mason 12 for Saddleback (10-14, 3-5). 
Heckman was 9 for 10 from the free-throw line. Cory Arnett scored 19 for 
Riverside, which has won 6 in a row since being upset by Saddleback in the 
first round. 
</P>

Bobby Joyce of Riverside was ejected after being called for double technical 
foul after a lose-ball foul was called on him midway in the second half. 
</P>

AZTECS AMBLE PAST TOREROS WITH 16 WALKS

<P>
In baseball vernacular, home plate is sometimes called the dish. To the 
University of San Diego pitchers Wednesday night at Smith Field, the dish must 
have looked more like a saucer. 
</P>
<P>
Four USD pitchers gave up 16 walks and the 15th-ranked San Diego State had only 
4 hits while winning the season opener for both teams, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you explain 16 walks?" USD Coach John Cunningham said. "Take those out 
and it's a whole different ball game." 
</P>
<P>
The tone was set early when San Diego State's second batter, Brian Dunn, walked 
off USD starter James Ferguson and later scored on Jeff Barry's double for a 
1-0 Aztec lead. Four other Aztec runners would also walk and eventually score. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first game and (the pitchers) wanted to throw the ball hard," USD 
freshman catcher Sean Gousha said. "They tried to muscle up and go beyond what 
they could do." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a 6-foot 7-inch sophomore and the Toreros' best pitcher, spent most 
of Tuesday in bed with the flu. Although he walked 8 Aztec batters in 4 
innings, he allowed just 2 hits and 1 earned run, but was victimized by 2 USD 
errors and left trailing, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferguson was one-third what he normally is," Cunningham said. "Nobody hit him 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State starter John Hemmerly didn't have as much trouble finding the 
plate. In 6 innings, Hemmerly, a junior, walked 4 but allowed just 2 hits and 1 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good," said Hemmerly, who was limited to 100 pitches. "I threw mostly 
fastballs. I wanted to keep going but coach wanted me to come out. I wanted to 
go a strong 5 (innings) at least." 
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit ball of the game, and the one that put the game out of reach 
for USD, was a 2-1 high fastball from Dave Monastero that Aztec left fielder 
Brian Lutes smacked over the left-field fence in the seventh inning. The drive 
over the 365-foot mark scored Dunn, who had reached on a fielder's choice and 
Harry Henderson, who had walked, to put the Aztecs ahead, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of that inning, USD, trailing 4-1, scored a run off Aztec reliever 
John Marshall. Jim Alexander fisted a single into left field to score Rick 
Doane and close the gap to 4-2. With runners on first and second and 2 out, 
pinch hitter Chris Stout, lined down the left-field line with the ball falling 
foul by inches. Gousha, who was on second, would have scored and Alexander, who 
had a good jump off first might have as well. Stout grounded to second on the 
next pitch and Marshall and the Aztecs survived a scare. 
</P>
<P>
USD got to Marshall for a run in the eighth and 2 in the ninth before Paul 
Austin came in to catch pinch-hitter Devin Bundy looking at strike three with a 
runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased," SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said. "USD is always tough on us. I 
thought we hit the ball pretty good. We did a lot of things well. I was really 
pleased for a first game. USD will be just fine." 
</P>
<P>
For USD, Andy Roberts hit 2 doubles in 4 at-bats and scored twice, Alexander 
was 2 for 4 with 2 runs batted in and Gousha impressed SDSU by throwing out 3 
of 5 potential base stealers.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS PLACE 5 ON ALL-STAR TEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers have placed five players, more than any other Major Indoor Soccer 
League team, on this season's All-Star team, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielders Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, defender Kevin Crow, and goalkeepers 
Zoltan Toth and Victor Nogueira were picked to play in the Feb. 22 game at 
Reunion Arena in Dallas. Players could not vote for teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Because the MISL isn't divided into divisions this season, All-Stars from six 
teams will play the host Dallas Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
Segota and Crow will be appearing for the fifth consecutive season. Segota has 
played in seven games. Toth will be in his fifth game, and Quinn in his fourth, 
but both may miss it because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira, who leads the league with a 2.44 goals-against average, will be 
making his first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place Baltimore Blast placed three players, and every other team in 
the league has two. Kim Roentved of Kansas City was named to his eighth 
All-Star team, tying him with Steve Zungul for the most appearances. CHRIS ELLO

El Camino High School's basketball team earned a measure of revenge Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-ranked Wildcats beat San Pasqual, 77-66, in an Avocado League 
basketball game, avenging a 60-57 loss on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We played 32 minutes of basketball this time," El Camino Coach Ray Johnson 
said. "Last time we didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual kept pace with El Camino's furious tempo in the first half, but the 
Wildcats still took a 43-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We played at their pace in the first half," San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. 
"But you can't play their pace without scoring." 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave league-leading El Camino an 8-1 league record. San Pasqual 
dropped to 8-9, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual took an 18-13 lead with less than a minute to play in the first 
period. But two free throws by Travis Gilley back-to-back baskets by Shaun 
Scurry and a two-pointer by Glen Ankton gave El Camino a 21-18 lead after the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual stayed within 2 or 3 points most of the second quarter. With 1:21 
left and after consecutive turnovers, El Camino's Dee Boyer blocked a shot by 
Erik Meek, was fouled, and made both free throws and the Wildcats led, 41-33. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer finished with a season-high 27 points and 11 rebounds. Ankton added 15 
and Todd Swanson 12, with 14 assists, for El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"Dee (Boyer) worked real hard tonight," Johnson said. "He had been trying to do 
too much last time. This time, he let it happen." 
</P>

FIRM SUED OVER LOAN AND ALLEGED LEASE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The chairman and chief executive of Gradco Systems Inc. has been accused in a 
$6-million lawsuit of trying to help negotiate a "usurious" loan and then 
backing out of a proposed real estate deal when the loan was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed Jan. 25 in Orange County Superior Court by Richard 
Boureston and Alton Laguna Partners, a limited partnership set up to develop 
office property for Irvine-based Gradco. Boureston is a general partner in 
Alton Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Gradco, Lance Cote of Irvine, said Wednesday that the lawsuit 
is "factually and legally meritless. The only reason it was filed was to coerce 
Gradco into leasing . . . space." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint contends that Gradco, a manufacturer of paper sorters and 
collators for office copiers and printers, backed out of an agreement to lease 
office space after Alton Laguna would not agree to a usurious loan that 
involved an unusual "facilitation fee." 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Gradco Chairman Keith Stewart told Boureston early 
last year that he would sign a long-term lease with Boureston's company if 
Boureston were to build an office to fit Gradco's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Alton Laguna found a land parcel in the Irvine Spectrum area, which Stewart and 
Gradco agreed to lease, the lawsuit states. Gradco negotiated lease terms with 
the plaintiffs, who were spending money on the project, the complaint added. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Stewart allegedly told Alton Laguna that Stewart and his attorney 
wanted a company called CBB to invest in the development. But Alton Laguna's 
lawyers advised against a direct investment for tax reasons and instead 
suggested that CBB loan construction funds to Alton Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Gradco's attorney recommended that CBB loan Alton Laguna $3 million 
as a portion of the temporary construction loan for the project, the suit 
states. When a permanent loan was obtained from traditional lenders, CBB was to 
get back its $3 million plus a "facilitation fee" of $1.8 million, or 60% of 
the loan amount, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Alton Laguna ultimately decided that it did not need CBB's $3 million. But by 
that time, conventional lenders who had been told of the proposed loan "were 
suspicious that Stewart had a personal interest in the CBB transaction," the 
lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart told Boureston that the Gradco lease of the new building did not hinge 
on the CBB loan, the lawsuit states. Even so, shortly after Alton Laguna's 
rejection of the loan, Gradco Secretary Newton Lee Jr. told Boureston that 
Gradco would not enter into a lease for the new project, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Gradco, Stewart and Lee acted in bad faith in dealing 
with Alton Laguna. It also alleges that Stewart, Lee and CBB conspired to 
"suggest that plaintiffs borrow money from CBB for a usurious fee . . . to 
acquire new space for Gradco. The fee, once paid, would personally benefit the 
individual defendants as well as CBB." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed by the Irvine law firm of Layman, Jones &amp; Dye, seeks 
damages for alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with potential 
business advantage and loss of the parcel's increased value. Attorneys for the 
plaintiffs declined to comment.

Pacific Scientific said it has agreed to sell its infrared analytic-instrument 
business in Maryland and a manufacturing plant in Anaheim to undisclosed 
buyers. The Newport Beach company did not disclose a purchase price for the 
Maryland unit but said it exceeded "book value," or the value of the property 
minus depreciation. Under the agreement, Pacific Scientific will also receive 
royalties based on the unit's future sales for a 5-year period. The 
analytic-instrument business is part of Pacific Scientific's Instrument 
Division, which is based in Silver Springs, Md. Last August, the company 
announced a restructuring plan that includes the sale of two of the division's 
three product lines and the sale of its Kin-Tech division plant in Anaheim. The 
company said it is engaged in discussions with a potential buyer for a second 
Maryland product line. Pacific Scientific said it expects to complete the sale 
of the 9-acre Kin-Tech facility within 150 days to an undisclosed buyer. The 
Kin-Tech unit, which manufactures aircraft products, and most of its 260 
employees are being relocated to a smaller facility closer to a company plant 
in Duarte. Pacific Scientific is a diversified manufacturer of electronic 
instruments and aerospace products.

Knight-Ridder's fourth-quarter net income fell 8% from a year ago to $45.6 
million. Revenue from continuing operations totaled $574.6 million, a gain of 
9%. For the year, net income totaled $156.3 million, up from $155.1 million in 
1987, while revenue from continuing operations rose to $2.08 billion from $1.96 
billion. Net income figures include income from broadcast operations, which 
Knight-Ridder announced in October that it would sell. The Miami-based media 
company said that while its newspapers had excellent growth in classified 
linage and revenue, they were hit by industrywide downward pressure on retail 
and general ad linage and higher costs for newsprint.

DOLLAR ADVANCES AS DEMAND HEATS UP LATE IN THE SESSION

The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Wednesday in a late 
surge of buying. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices ended higher in New York after declining overseas. In New York, 
Republic National Bank issued a late quote of $391.50 an ounce, up from $390.80 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency started the day by advancing in the Far East but later turned 
mixed in nervous European trading as the markets awaited results of Friday's 
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven major 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar suddenly shot up, finishing 
at its highs for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Some dollar demand came out of the blue," said Robert Hatcher, vice president 
of foreign exchange at the New York office of Barclays Bank PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they weren't certain what inspired the last-minute dollar buying. 
Some, like Hatcher, suggested that it could have reflected Japanese investors' 
interest in the U.S. Treasury Department's upcoming quarterly refunding. The 
auctions of Treasury bonds, used to help finance the federal debt, often spur 
foreign investors to buy dollars in advance to pay for the U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the dollar's late surge had a snowball effect and brought 
more buyers into the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a little bit of panic set in," suggested Michael Dallow, a currency 
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range before Friday's 
meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven and the release that day of U.S. 
unemployment figures for January.

TO ACCENTUATE THEIR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS, IMMIGRANTS SEEK EXPERTS' HELP IN 
POLISHING THE WAY THEY SPEAK

When Der-Shsuan Lii arrived in the United States in 1985, he read and wrote 
English well enough to complete a master's degree at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a different story when it came to speaking his new language. Lii, a 
native of Taiwan, had trouble with English vowels, l's and r's and the th 
sound. There were many words he could not pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
His language problems quickly became a block to his career as management 
systems director for the San Gabriel Valley Medical Center, where his chances 
for promotion were dashed because managers did not understand him. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to persuade people to cooperate and to improve their management," he 
said. "Naturally, I had a lot of resistance." 
</P>
<P>
To overcome this obstacle, Lii, like thousands of immigrants nationwide, sought 
to improve his speaking by taking an accent reduction course taught by a speech 
pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really improved my pronunciation," he said of the class. "People noticed 
the change." 
</P>
<P>
Speech pathologists say they have become the modern equivalent of Henry 
Higgins, the character who refashioned Eliza Doolittle's speech in "Pygmalion" 
and "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
Because people are judged not just by how they look but also how they sound, 
employees whose speech is unpolished are considered less intelligent and get 
promoted less often, experts note. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retreat Into Silence 
</P>
<P>
"People in the United States hear a Vietnamese accent, for example, and it's 
unfortunate, but many are not going to listen intently to that person 
addressing a group because it's difficult to understand," said Lou Ann Brine, a 
Lakewood speech pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Dickson Gold, a speech therapist whose practice is based in Irvine, 
observed: "I have a client who is a very bright engineer. He told me that, 
whereas he puts all the work into a project, he does not present it because he 
has a heavy accent and his co-workers and supervisors do not understand him 
clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"In work, the ability to interchange ideas verbally has a powerful influence on 
the effectiveness of the employee and on the ability of that person to rise in 
the company. The silent employee is not recognized for his work and he very 
often is silent because people have difficulty understanding him." 
</P>
<P>
Although immigrants say accent reduction programs help, such efforts have been 
criticized because some say they homogenize speech -- they make all speakers 
sound like television anchors. 
</P>
<P>
But speech pathologists say this will never occur. 
</P>
<P>
"A person will never lose an accent completely," said Beverly Gottlieb-Karp, a 
Santa Monica speech pathologist. "There are infinitesimally few who can change 
their accent after they reach maturity or who can speak a second language like 
a native." 
</P>
<P>
Iris Maybruck, a West Los Angeles speech therapist, agreed, noting, "My goal is 
not to necessarily help (clients) lose their accent but to pronounce English so 
that it enhances the way they speak. We in the U.S. love accents. You hear the 
television commercials with French accents and you love them, but it's because 
you understand them." 
</P>
<P>
Therapy to reduce an accent does not come cheap, whether it is offered 
individually or in small groups. In the Los Angeles area, teachers contacted 
charged $60-$85 a session for roughly a dozen individual sessions. Fees for 
small group sessions -- in which participants often are referred by 
corporations -- were $450 a person for 10 meetings or $720 for 13 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The experts try various methods to help their clients. They hand out tapes and 
workbooks for home practice. One technique has speakers use a mirror to see how 
their tongue should be positioned -- an exercise that Lynn Gold asked two 
Vietnamese immigrants to perform recently in a Huntington Beach class. 
</P>
<P>
Maybruck tape-records her students periodically so they can hear their 
progress. Dennis Napoli, a Newport Beach speech pathologist, requires clients 
to carry a notebook to jot down terms important to them. He then records the 
words so students can practice saying them. 
</P>
<P>
English pronunciation, experts say, is difficult for newcomers to master 
because it differs from their native tongue in sound, grammar, syllabification 
and melody (the timing and pitch variations of speech). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Melody Patterns 
</P>
<P>
The wrong emphasis on the wrong syllable can make a word in English 
undecipherable. Uncommon melody patterns also can be a hindrance; when the flat 
lilt of the Indian language is applied to English, for example, it can prove 
utterly distracting to a listener. 
</P>
<P>
Learning correct pronunciation in a new language is always difficult. But it 
can be an even tougher chore if speakers studied extensively in their native 
lands, where they only heard the new language spoken with an accent. 
</P>
<P>
Masatoshi Teramoto studied English in Japan and learned the language well 
enough to read novels. But he heard English spoken only by Japanese. As a 
result, when he arrived in America in 1987, "I found I could hardly hear what 
people were saying." 
</P>
<P>
That was a problem in his job as a loan officer at Tokai Bank of California, 
where he communicates loan amounts, interest rates, maturity dates and other 
information daily to foreign banks and governments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Confidence-Builder 
</P>
<P>
Teramoto enrolled in an accent reduction class with South Pasadena speech 
pathologist Elaine Low and said that after 15 classes he felt "more confident." 
</P>
<P>
"Before I wanted to speak English but I had no confidence to understand what 
people were talking about, so it was very difficult to ask questions. Now I can 
understand English much better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I don't understand all of what they say, I can understand what they 
mean. . . . I have to keep good relations with those who are working in our 
customer banks. . . . After I got confidence from her classes, it's been very 
helpful for me."

DAY CARE FOR SICK CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL GIVES PARENTS ANOTHER OPTION -- DAY OR NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, Gray is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Debbie Koslowsky's 6-year-old son Alex was too sick to go to school, she 
would bring him to work to lie on the floor of her office at the West Valley 
YMCA in Reseda, or she would stay home with him. 
</P>
<P>
Since Northridge Hospital Medical Center opened its Kids Care program for 
mildly sick children, she has another option, which she has used twice in the 
past six weeks, when Alex had two cases of strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time Alex was there, I was wondering if he could also have an ear 
infection. The doctor checked Alex at no charge, which not only saved me the 
trouble and the $44 cost of going to the pediatrician after work, but I knew 
that if he had had a problem, I would have known about it early in the day," 
said Koslowsky, 38, a physical education director. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge Kids Care program, open since November, is set up to care for 
mildly sick children, from 6 weeks to 15 years old, 24 hours a day, at a cost 
of $3.25 per hour, or $2.75 for hospital employees. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which operates as an outpatient service under Northridge's 
hospital license, "does not accept children for Kids Care who have chicken pox, 
lice, measles or high temperatures that are not responding to Tylenol," said 
Cindy Albright, a registered nurse and coordinator for Kids Care. Parents do 
not have to call ahead to say they are bringing a child in, but it is 
encouraged, and pre-registration forms that include the child's medical history 
help speed the 10-minute registration process. 
</P>
<P>
One hospital staff nursing assistant is assigned to care for every four 
children. Registered nurses oversee the care and give the necessary 
medications, either over-the-counter drugs or medications already prescribed 
for the child. Physicians from the hospital's UCLA Family Residency Program 
examine the children each morning and notify parents if they find medical 
problems that they think need more evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids Care facilities, in the pediatric wing on the fifth floor of the 
hospital, are divided into a quiet room, a crafts room and a kitchen. Most 
children become involved in crafts, directed by a part-time child activities 
coordinator, or take the video route, playing an ever-popular Nintendo game or 
watching TV and videotapes. Some bring their own treasured blankets, backpacks, 
books, dolls or other toys. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Reitz, 12, was recently at Kids Care after a night of high fever and an 
upset stomach. Although Carrie was feeling better, her mother hesitated to let 
her go to school. The day she was at Kids Care, she played with the other three 
children there, who were from 1 to 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Was it scary to come to a hospital for the day? "No," she said. "I wasn't real 
sure when I came in. There's a lot of things to do. You can read books, help 
the little kids color. . . . It's better than home." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie's mother, Beverly, is a teacher at First Lutheran Pre-School across the 
street from the hospital. "Parents who work tend to bring their children to the 
nursery school even if the children are not 100%," she said. She thinks that 
the hospital's program provides the added care and reassurance parents need to 
leave their children to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started for Employees 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Adams, administrator of Northridge Hospital, the Kids Care 
program was started largely to attract and retain hospital employees. 
Northridge Hospital and Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, both owned 
by Hospital Corp. of America, employ a total of 1,600 people, Adams said. The 
center cares for an average of four or five children a day. 
</P>
<P>
Two Los Angeles hospitals -- California Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital 
-- have recently closed their sick-child care programs. Another, at Torrance 
Memorial Medical Center, the model for Northridge's program, is going strong, 
caring for an average of five to 18 children a day. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy Lane, child-care coordinator for the city of Los Angeles, said closure of 
these programs may be because "it's hard for people to bring an ill child to a 
place that's relatively unfamiliar. It's a tough concept for parents to bring 
their children for day care to a health-care facility." 
</P>
<P>
Lane said the most successful sick-child care programs have been in suburban 
areas, geographically and administratively connected to the sick child's 
regular day-care or nursery school program. On a sick day, the child doesn't go 
to an entirely different place, just to a different room or wing at the same 
school. Rainbow Retreat, a day-care center run by a private company, has such a 
setup in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Risks 
</P>
<P>
Are there risks involved in bringing a mildly ill child to a hospital setting 
for care? Helen Lederer, an Encino pediatrician, said the question has yet to 
be answered. But she thinks that the license requirements for such programs -- 
mildly ill day-care children are kept separate from hospital patients, and 
employees who care for the day-care children do not also care for hospitalized 
children -- minimize the risks. 
</P>
<P>
"But the risks of sick-child care just haven't been delineated; it's an 
emerging field that's now getting increasing attention," Lederer warned. 
</P>
<P>
What is well-known, Lederer said, is that the demand for sick-child care is 
tremendous. "Every day, at least four times a day, parents ask me: 'Can my 
child go to school yet?' 'Is he ready to go back to day care?' The need is 
there." 
</P>
<P>
For parents who want their children to be cared for at home, availability and 
cost can be an issue. The cost to have someone trained in basic nursing come to 
your home to care for your child, according to the firm At Home Health in La 
Canada, is $11 an hour for three to eight hours of care. A 12-hour shift runs 
$154. And not all visiting nurse associations provide this type of care; most 
provide nursing visits rather than all-day care. 
</P>
<P>
At Kids Care, the children are sent home with a daily log sheet showing what 
the child did, when he ate or slept, what medications were given and when, what 
food was eaten and when, and other information related to the illness. 
</P>
<P>
To receive a pre-registration packet on the Kids Care program at Northridge 
Hospital, call (818) 885-5324. Although walk-in care, without pre-registration, 
is provided, parents must provide proof of the child's immunization history.

'SHORTCUT SHARKS' ON A CRUSADE AGAINST GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Colvin is a Redondo Beach free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're content to be a member of The Pack -- that huge mass of drivers 
willing to be led by their license plates down the jammed highways of life -- 
then driving for the next four months on the Ventura Freeway will call for 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 21, the state Department of Transportation will jam the freeway's 
legendary 267,000 cars a day onto the south side of the center divider during 
the widening and reconstruction of 3,200 feet of pavement between Warner Center 
and Calabasas; when the westbound lanes are completed, all six lanes of traffic 
will be diverted to the north side. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, the construction project will shut down five off- and 
on-ramps for the duration. And if an accident occurs, there's no way to clear 
it to the side of the road because all available space will be taken up with 
live-action, use-it-or-lose-it traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
So be prepared to listen to your books on tape, do your taxes with one eye on 
the road or whatever else it is that keeps your mind off the time you are 
wasting. If, however, you drive to a different downshift and your transmission 
transcends such slug-like non-activities as patiently enduring traffic, there 
are alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shortcut Sharks' 
</P>
<P>
Brian Roberts and Richard Schwadel, Southern California natives and 
self-described "shortcut sharks," highway hackers of the first order whose 
motto is To move is to live, to stop is to suffocate and die, are ready to 
point you the way. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of a book called "L.A. Shortcuts" that they will publish this summer, 
Roberts and Schwadel say breaking free from highway hell is as easy as heading 
for an off-ramp. There are more than 21,000 miles of surface streets in Los 
Angeles and, especially in the San Fernando Valley, many of them are more wide 
open than the highways. 
</P>
<P>
"The shortest distance between two points is never a straight line," said 
Schwadel, 32, who uses his penchant for pavement pathfinding to get to 
free-lance film editing jobs from his home in Marina del Rey. "That's what 
separates shortcut sharks from the rest of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 30, a film editor and director who lives in Hollywood, said some of 
the 90 shortcuts compiled by the partners, including 13 for the Valley, don't 
save a lot of time. But they will keep you moving while others are riding the 
brake. "The point is to get away from where everybody else is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Schwadel anticipate that revealing their street secrets will anger 
some of their friends. "People who are shortcutters will think of us as 
traitors," Schwadel said. 
</P>
<P>
But, they say, everybody has some tricks for getting around and all they are 
doing is compiling them. "It's like modern folklore," Roberts said. "Everybody 
knows it, but nobody's ever written it down." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have acknowledged the potential for tie-ups in this phase of 
the three-year project to widen and improve the Ventura Freeway between 
Calabasas and Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
They have come up with what they think is the most ambitious traffic diversion 
and public education effort in highway construction history. It involves 
observation cameras to monitor traffic, an automated traffic signal system that 
can be altered to deal with the traffic flow on Ventura Boulevard, construction 
of a new frontage road, new signals, more traffic cops, a fleet of tow trucks 
to clear disabled vehicles and financial incentives for drivers to take up 
ride-sharing and van-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kilmurray, the Caltrans engineer who designed the plan for managing the 
traffic snarl, said no acceptable alternate routes skirt the area that will be 
torn up starting this month. So a new local access route was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the eastbound traffic is headed for the Warner Center area, Kilmurray 
said, and if a few hundred motorists each hour use the alternate exit at 
Parkway Calabasas and the new frontage road on the north side of the freeway, 
traffic should keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
Westbound traffic headed for the Calabasas area will be encouraged to exit at 
Shoup or Woodlake avenues, cross the freeway at Valley Circle Boulevard and 
recross to the north on Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test is going to be this next segment of work," said Kilmurray, who 
is now chief of design for the Century Freeway and Harbor transitway projects. 
A similar traffic diversion plan will be used there. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts and Schwadel take the idea that there are no alternative routes as 
a challenge to find some, and they offer two basic east and west routes that 
actually could be traveled in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Sailing on Burbank 
</P>
<P>
Their plan for westbound drivers is to duck off the Ventura Freeway at the 
first sign of brake lights, head north to Burbank Boulevard in the East Valley, 
or Oxnard or Topham streets if drivers are west of Reseda Boulevard. Burbank 
often offers clear sailing while The Pack is barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
At Topanga Canyon Boulevard, head south to Avenue San Luis and turn west. 
Although Avenue San Luis will be part of the local access route between Valley 
Circle and Parkway Calabasas, you, shortcutter, go left at Rigoletto Street, 
right at Calabash Street, left on Deseret Drive, a quick right at Mulholland 
Drive, left at Valmar Road, right at Park Ora, right at Park Sienna, right at 
Park Capri, left at Park Granada and then down Parkway Calabasas into the belly 
of what is likely to be a beastly traffic tie-up. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound escape hatch is easier to follow: Use a temporary off-ramp to 
exit early onto Calabasas Road, go right at Parkway Calabasas, thread your way 
through the Parks but then stay on wide-open Mulholland all the way to Topanga. 
Go north on Topanga and the whole valley opens up to you. (Travel time east or 
west between Parkway Calabasas and Topanga Canyon is slightly more than eight 
minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Rather than re-entering the freeway at Topanga, go east on Victory Boulevard, 
turn right on Topham Street just before you get to the railroad tracks and stay 
on it as it turns into Oxnard Street, all the way to Louise Avenue, where you 
turn right. That's a shortcut they call "Kick in the Oxnard" for its quick 
access to the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow to Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Louise takes you to Burbank Boulevard, one of Rogers and Schwadel's highly 
recommended east-west roadways, and you can follow it all the way to the San 
Diego Freeway or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
One of their rules of the road is that "residents take precedence." Speeding 
and squealing will cause complaints, and complaints will bring police 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing magic about these routes, Schwadel said. The partners 
consulted Caltrans and Los Angeles traffic-flow maps, learned about the timing 
of traffic lights and surveyed friends, cab drivers, television news crews and 
bar-stool compatriots for advice. Then they drove the shortcuts, checking for 
hazards, such as school crossings, and timing them. 
</P>
<P>
But whether drivers will use the routes has little to do with knowing that they 
exist, the authors said. "It all has to do with your attitude and state of 
mind," Schwadel said, and shortcut sharks rebel rather than stew in someone 
else's exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's anarchy out there," they write. "The cardinal rule is there are no rules. 
But there are shortcuts."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
An article on Feb. 2 incorrectly stated the number of cars that travel the 
Ventura Freeway between Warner Center and Calabasas. According to Caltrans, the 
correct figure is 153,000. That section of freeway is to be expanded in early 
March subject to charge depending on the weather. In addition, Avenue San Luis 
is not part of the local access route suggested by Caltrans.

ENRICHED STUDIES SCHOOL GETS A'S FOR NO-NONSENSE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PERRY, Perry is a Sylmar free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a fourth-grader, Melissa Kaplan was studying Spanish with high school 
students. Now, in 10th grade, Kaplan has finished four years of that language 
and is working on her fourth year of French. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the story of a prodigious youth. At one public school in the 
San Fernando Valley, such academic achievements are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, or SOCES, one of 87 "magnet" 
programs in the Los Angeles Unified School District, prides itself on a 
no-nonsense approach to education. Providing classes in grades 4 through 12, 
SOCES has one of the lowest dropout rates in the city, higher-than-average test 
scores and virtually no gang or drug problems. There is a list of 2,000 
students waiting to enroll there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Values 
</P>
<P>
But the peaceful atmosphere at SOCES is not just a result of academic 
discipline: Teachers, administrators, parents and students alike attribute it 
to the values curriculum consisting of 25 morality units developed by the 
staff. These are incorporated into each grade's curriculum in homeroom and 
social studies classes. Units cover such topics as honesty, integrity and 
responsibility for cleanliness on the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Magnet schools were created to enhance racial integration, and the student 
population of each campus must be 60% or more Hispanic, black or Asian. Most 
students at magnet schools are bused from other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
To attract youths from distant neighborhoods, the magnet schools offer 
specialized programs. Each campus focuses on a particular area of study, such 
as science, mathematics or the arts, or emphasizes a particular educational 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents choose this school for various reasons," said SOCES Principal Eli 
Brent, 62. Some parents, he said, are unhappy with their neighborhood school. 
"Some parents want an integrative education." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1978 
</P>
<P>
The center was founded in 1978. In 1980, it moved to Reseda but retained 
"Sherman Oaks" in its name. The center's 1,625 students are bused in from 330 
schools. Students enter SOCES by way of a complex "lottery" based on a variety 
of factors: Did the student graduate from an elementary magnet program? Does he 
or she come from an overcrowded or predominantly minority neighborhood school? 
Has the student been on the waiting list a year or longer? 
</P>
<P>
The center differs from most public schools in several ways. As in Kaplan's 
case, students are placed in mixed-age groups based on their ability. Some 
classes include fourth- through sixth-grade students; others have seventh- 
through ninth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Another innovation is double periods. On Monday, students attend a standard 
schedule of six 52-minute classes. The remainder of the week, however, is 
divided into Tuesday-Thursday and Wednesday-Friday classes that meet for an 
hour and 45 minutes each. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of such a schedule, Brent said, is that it gives the teacher more 
time to spend with each student. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Seating 
</P>
<P>
To increase student participation, seating in most classrooms is divided into 
halves, each half facing the center of the room. A class in study skills and 
one in art and music appreciation are required for every student. And, SOCES 
maintains a norm of 29.5 students per class instead of a norm of 34 or 35 found 
at other schools, Brent said. 
</P>
<P>
Extracurricular activities, most of which are held at lunchtime, are a major 
focus at the school. Brent said: "Every student can be a big frog in a small 
pond. In a normal school, you're competing for all these spots. You're not, 
here. If our chorus is too large, we assign another teacher. If our tennis team 
is too large, we break it off and make another one." 
</P>
<P>
Although SOCES offers a range of the usual after-school activities, late bus 
service is not convenient for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they change the late bus route, I told my son he won't be able to 
participate in sports this year," said Beatrice Paniagua, a self-employed 
housekeeper whose 16-year-old son is bused to SOCES from Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very difficult time keeping students after school for football games 
and social events," said Paul Kaplan, SOCES' advisory council chairman and the 
father of three high-school-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working at Academics 
</P>
<P>
The school tries to make up for its lack of athletics and activities by working 
harder at academics, said Stephanie Gross, 15, a cheerleader in her 7th year at 
SOCES. The teachers, she said, spend extra time with students who are having 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"People here pay more attention to you; they work with you more," Gross said. 
"They give up their lunchtimes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nicole Perry, 15, the student body vice president, "It's family-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Away from school, SOCES students bear a heavy load of homework. Those who need 
tutoring are helped by older students during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
All of this appears to be producing results: 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, SOCES' seventh-graders scored in the 62nd percentile on the math 
section of the California Test of Basic Skills. The district average fell in 
the 45th percentile. Twelfth-grade reading scores at SOCES were in the 62nd 
percentile, compared to the district's 37th percentile average. Graduates of 
the Reseda school have gone on to Vassar, Radcliffe, Johns Hopkins and other 
top schools. 
</P>
<P>
* "Center Source," SOCES's school newspaper, has for the last two years won a 
National Scholastic Press award and was rated first class by the Columbia 
Scholastic Press in 1987. Diane Honda, journalism instructor and yearbook 
adviser, said the newspaper class won a spot news writing competition at a 
state championship. 
</P>
<P>
* SOCES' dropout rate, according to the school district, was less than 3% for 
the ninth- through 12th-grade population of 340 students. This compares to 
neighboring Taft High School's rate of 8.49% with 2,379 students, and 
Birmingham High School's rate of 6.79% with 2,371 students. The districtwide 
average is 14.46%. 
</P>
<P>
Equal doses of discipline are mixed with the spirit of learning. Strict rules 
are a priority with Brent, who took over at SOCES in 1979 after working at an 
inner-city school. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing about having fourth- through 12th-graders," Brent said, "is 
that if a 12th-grader wants to smoke in the bathroom, a fourth-grader's going 
to tell on him. We joke about that here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple Rule 
</P>
<P>
The rule concerning drugs on campus is simple: If a student is caught, he will 
be turned over to the police, Brent said. And the principal recently decided 
that the wearing of hats was counterproductive to learning. 
</P>
<P>
"So we outlawed hats, and we thought we'd get a hue and cry," he said. "Not a 
word. Everybody accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sandy Hendricks, juvenile coordinator for the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Valley detectives, gangs and violence are less a problem at 
SOCES than at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Again, school officials say, it all comes down to working harder at teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"The school creates an environment where there is a tremendous amount of pride 
in student achievement," said Kathryn Lee, a superintendent in the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not a number at SOCES," said Gross, the student. "You don't fall 
through the cracks."

THE NEW: JUST FOR LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smiles are back in style. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, we're talking the Smiley-Face, "Have-A-Nice Day" logos from the 
early 1970s that used to emblazon everything from T-shirts to earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can relate to a happy face. It makes you feel good to look at it," says 
22-year-old Karen Davidson of Woodland Hills. Davidson collects smiley-face 
memorabilia, some that is handed down from her older sister, and her trove 
includes everything from necklaces to jars to bowls and cups. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to mention the standard black-on-yellow buttons that cheer up 
Davidson's clothes from denim jackets to funky, antique jackets. 
</P>
<P>
In a testament to the durability of the happy face, there's even a boutique on 
Melrose Avenue called "Have A Nice Day" that sells 1960s and early 1970s 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sell anything new, just collectibles," says owner Masaki Fujii, whose 
stock of smiley faces range from 50-cent decals to buttons, patches, shirts, 
clocks and $50 original sweatshirts. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion-seeking Valley-ites don't have to hip-hop over the hill to West 
Hollywood, however. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoon Junction in the Sherman Oaks Galleria will be stocking T-shirts and 
stickers in February. 
</P>
<P>
"They're starting to be a hot little item," says sales clerk Darren Duhart. He 
attributes the growing craze to the Bobby McFerrin a cappella song, "Don't 
Worry, Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
But others say the retro fad was resurrected last year by the controversial 
musical and cultural movement Acid House, which originated in London, whose 
emblem is the yellow and black smiley face button. 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't aspire to nice days, however, Aah's in Sherman Oaks carries 
buttons with a straight face that say merely "Have A Day." 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of stock on the smiley-face and straight-face T-shirts," Aah's clerk 
Mike Sutton says with a frown.

CRITIC AT LARGE: TELEVISION FESTIVAL REPLAYING OLD AND NEW GOODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Museum of Broadcasting's television festival at the County Museum of Art, 
which is about to have its sixth running, has become an important annual 
fixture. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's artful blending of past and present, nostalgia and current 
celebration, would be a hit in Syracuse or Minneapolis, but it goes down 
particularly well here, where a good deal of the product originated and where 
many of its creators live and can be persuaded to come along, take a bow and 
explain how the magic happened. 
</P>
<P>
This year's offerings begin on March 1 with a tribute to the television version 
of Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple," with its long-running stars Tony Randall and 
Jack Klugman on hand along with producer-director Garry Marshall and Harvey 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The festival ends on March 23 with an evening honoring Loretta Young and 
presenting two dramas from her anthology series, "The Pearl" and "The Prettiest 
Girl in Town." 
</P>
<P>
The rarities -- treasures amid the treasures -- include Stephen Sondheim's only 
original work for television, "Evening Primrose," a musical starring Anthony 
Perkins and set in a department store. It was broadcast in 1966 and has not 
been shown since. It's being presented on March 2 and introduced by Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Elliott and Audrey Meadows will host an evening of the splendidly foolish 
television work of Bob and Ray (March 9). Partner Ray Goulding, sadly, is 
seriously ailing and unable to attend. While the team and their innumerable 
voices were most at home on radio, their TV work had a wonderful innocent 
silliness, like Ray's cookery lessons as Mary Margaret McGoon, featuring 
recipes for half-baked Indian pudding and quince and kumquat jelly. 
</P>
<P>
The other archival treats include the Mary Martin "Annie Get Your Gun" from 
1957, to be introduced by her co-star, John Raitt, and the young Dennis Hopper 
in "The Last Summer," a Studio One drama from the '50s, with Hopper present. It 
screens March 17. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a tribute to "The Waltons" on March 10, with its creator Earl 
Hamner Jr. and many of the cast, Ellen Corby, Michael Learned and Richard 
Thomas among them, on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lemmon talks about his early life in television on March 18, and will 
present a Ford Theater production, "Marriageable Male," in which he co-starred 
with Ida Lupino. 
</P>
<P>
It's 35 years since Steve Allen invented -- or gave an enduring style to -- 
"The Tonight Show," and thereby established insomnia as a national trait. Allen 
and two of the show's vocalists -- Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme -- along with 
producers Bill Harbach, Dwight Hemion and Nick Vanoff and announcer Gene 
Rayburn will reminisce about those remarkable nights on March 3. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be three late-night offerings -- well, 10 p.m., not too late -- on 
March 4, 11 and 18, consisting of excerpts from the early television writing 
and performing of Woody Allen. One of the pleasures is a Kraft Theater Music 
Hall special called "Woody Allen Looks at 1967." 
</P>
<P>
The present-day series to be honored are equally interesting, and range from 
"The Wonder Years" (March 4) to "Family Ties" (March 22). Michael J. Fox and 
most of the other principals will be present, along with creator Gary David 
Goldberg, for that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Stephen J. Cannell will host an evening with "Wiseguy" on March 11. 
All the Golden Girls are scheduled to attend an evening devoted to their show 
on March 15. Garry Shandling will present two episodes of his show the next 
evening (Mar. 16), and Candice Bergen and a large number of the creators and 
co-stars of "Murphy Brown" will appear on March 21. It's the newest of the 
television offerings to be honored.

The Museum of Broadcasting has become an important and accessible archive of 
the radio and television past. What it does at its year-round presentations in 
New York and at the festival here is offer reminders that there were always a 
goodly number of oases in the wasteland, and that, like any art form, 
television has gained subtlety, sophistication and strength as time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
What is also true to say is that the museum rescues television from the curse 
of its own terrible transience. Out of sight is not out of mind and, for 
another evening at least, the delights are back in sight.

WILL REAGAN PLAY SELF IN BRADY MOVIE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rumors have been rampant, but the question persists: Will Ronald Reagan go 
back into the movies? 
</P>
<P>
As Hollywood deals go, a movie role for Reagan is still in the 
"pre-pre"-development stage, but the most likely candidate for the 
ex-President's cinematic comeback appears to be a planned David 
Puttnam-produced feature based on the published story of former White House 
press secretary James Brady. He was shot in the head during the 1981 
assassination attempt on Reagan and has maintained a close friendship with the 
Reagans ever since. 
</P>
<P>
According to people involved with the movie, Reagan has been asked to appear as 
himself in the film; he has expressed enthusiasm about the project, and he has 
made it clear to Puttnam that he would be free to consider the role after 
leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my information," Brady acknowledged on Wednesday, that Reagan will agree 
to play himself in the still-to-be-filmed movie. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mark Weinberg, spokesman for the Reagans in Los Angeles, said in 
response: "I am not aware of any plans for him to be in any movies." 
</P>
<P>
The former President's name has been bandied about Hollywood's luncheon haunts 
for months in advance of his leaving office. For instance, a Los Angeles radio 
station offered him a $100,000 sports-announcing position. There has even been 
talk among some show-business Republicans of granting Reagan an honorary Oscar. 
But, until now, none of the talk has included specifics on any movie. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed film is based on "Thumbs Up," a book about Brady's life and 
recovery, which was written with his cooperation by Maryland author Mollie 
Dickenson in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One reason why Reagan might want to appear in the movie is that Brady, whom 
Reagan kept as the titled White House press secretary throughout his two terms, 
has a financial interest in the movie as well as the book. 
</P>
<P>
Puttnam optioned the biography last June for his Enigma studios and attached 
British screenwriter Robert Bolt ("The Mission," "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. 
Zhivago"), Dickenson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bolt already has written "a first draft" for the Warner Bros. project, 
Dickenson said. However, she noted that she has not heard definitively at this 
point whether Reagan will play himself in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we have been hoping for," she explained. "If Jim (Brady) 
really wanted him to do it, Reagan would." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Dickenson, Brady, Puttnam and Bolt met with Reagan to discuss the 
project, Dickenson said. "In our audience with Reagan, David (Puttnam) said, 
'Maybe you would play yourself in the movie?' and Reagan responded, 'Well, I'll 
soon be at liberty to do things like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dickenson said she mentioned it again at the White House Christmas party when 
she went through the receiving line and shook hands with the President. 
</P>
<P>
"He was noncommittal," she recalled, "but Mrs. Reagan said to me, 'It is the 
most wonderful book.' " 
</P>
<P>
So, if Reagan did appear in the movie, who would be his co-stars? 
</P>
<P>
Dickenson said that Puttnam has "mentioned" Marlon Brando to play Brady. Asked 
if Brando's ultra-liberal politics might squash the Reagan deal, Dickenson 
laughed and said, "I don't know what to make of that." 
</P>
<P>
Brady, however, said he wants Tom Selleck or Burt Reynolds to play him. 
</P>
<P>
But Dickenson said that she was taking the Reynolds suggestion seriously. "Jim 
has a wonderful sense of humor, and Burt Reynolds is so funny. And also Burt 
could do it straight and it would be a hell of a role for him." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hackman also has been suggested in some press reports. But Dickenson noted 
that when she saw him at the Washington premiere of "Mississippi Burning" 
recently, he didn't know about the project. 
</P>
<P>
For some time, there has been a coterie of Hollywood Republicans with longtime 
ties to the former President who have been talking up the idea of having Reagan 
win an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be marvelous if the academy (Academy of Motion Pictures Arts 
and Sciences) recognized Ronald Reagan's contribution not only to the country 
but to our industry," said Reagan's good friend, producer A. C. Lyles. 
</P>
<P>
So what has Reagan himself said about resuming his Hollywood career? 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, when he moved out of the White House and arrived in Los Angeles for 
good, he quipped to reporters: "I was asked to play a part in a remake of 
'Bedtime For Bonzo.' 
</P>
<P>
"Only this time they wanted me to play Bonzo."

NATALIA MAKAROVA IN TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO SOVIET STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-minute ovation and bouquet upon bouquet of flowers greeted ballerina 
Natalia Makarova Wednesday night in her triumphant return to the Soviet Union 
she left 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
'I have no words," the 49-year-old dancer said after performing on the Kirov 
Theater stage for the first time since her defection in 1970. "I am so happy 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Since she stepped foot on Soviet soil for the first time on Jan. 22 she has 
been engulfed in tearful embraces with the family and public she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Deafening cries of "Welcome" met her as she stepped on stage to dance two pas 
de deux from the ballet "Onegin." The first defecting Soviet artist to accept 
an invitation to perform in her homeland had long dreamed of returning to the 
Soviet Union to see her family and friends and dance with her former company, 
but never dreamed it would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
To an adoring standing-room-only audience of 2,200, Makarova said, "I could 
never imagine that one day I'd come back to dance on this stage." 
</P>
<P>
Her poignant and energetic dancing with French partner Alexander Sombart and 
jubilant response to the audience belied any indication of the enormous effort 
the petite ballerina had made to conquer the tremendous fatigue brought on by 
the week's emotional highs, torturous rehearsals and rounds of meetings with 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
And, if Makarova had any doubts about being welcomed back, she lost them after 
dancing the first of the two scheduled pas de deux from the ballet "Onegin" 
when the audience worked itself into a frenzy of clapping and calls of 
"Natasha," the affectionate form of Natalia. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the second pas de deux, some members of the audience were crying. 
For 20 minutes they clapped and welcomed her back, crying out, "We have been 
waiting for you, Natasha" 
</P>
<P>
Her final words to her fans: "My love is so great that I cannot embrace the 
half of you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overwhelming welcome, there was some dissent in the audience, and 
the Kirov Theatre did not appear to be welcoming her officially. 
</P>
<P>
Though her invitation to dance in the Soviet Union was brought about by the 
efforts of the Kirov's chief choreographer and artistic director Oleg 
Vinogradov, there were no officials from the Kirov among those who gave 
speeches after her performance. Instead, she was welcomed back to Leningrad by 
organizers of the Leningrad film festival at which she showed earlier this week 
"Ballerina," the BBC documentary she wrote and starred in. 
</P>
<P>
During one of the speeches commending her, a member of the audience yelled out, 
"Enough of this. You are praising her too much." 
</P>
<P>
But the film festival organizers seemed to speak for the majority of the 
audience when they not only praised her performance but expressed political 
beliefs equating the new freedoms brought by glasnost "with a time of hope," 
sentiments that even a year ago would have been dangerous to voice. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the theater, there were no sellers of tickets, only hopeful buyers. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to be first to ask theatergoers if they had an extra ticket, 
ballet aficionados knocked on the windows of taxis driving up to the Kirov 
before the cars had even stopped. Inside the gilt-painted two-century-old 
theater, the audience was crammed to the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
Admitted Irina Kolpakova, one of Makarova's closest friends from the Kirov, the 
1,700-seat theater had at least another 500 guests standing. At least 20 people 
were packed into the orchestra pit with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
In the center box balcony seats sat her husband, American businessman Edward 
Karkar, and her mother, stepfather and stepbrother. 
</P>
<P>
Only the night before, lack of sleep combined with emotional exhaustion and the 
physical strain of rehearsals on her injured leg and exhausted body had 
threatened her with "collapse." But Wednesday night she danced perfectly for 
her adoring countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Even before this historic performance, recorded by the BBC for a documentary on 
the Kirov, the tension and excitement were palpable. 
</P>
<P>
After the performance, one woman who sat silently weeping said, "I am moved to 
tears because her performance was so perfect, because she is as beautiful as 
she was, and because she is back." But the man beside her said, "Though her 
dancing was perfect, and I respect her work, I cannot respect her. She is a 
traitor." 
</P>
<P>
In the front row sat Lena Kudrashova, the former wife of Makarova's 
stepbrother. Remembering back to when Makarova defected in London, she spoke of 
the dichotomy of Soviet opinion. Makarova's family, she said, "felt support 
from some people, but there were others who did not like what Natalia had 
done." 
</P>
<P>
When Makarova left the Kirov Ballet in 1970 while the company was touring 
London, she was denounced as a traitor and mention of the renowned ballerina's 
name was removed from Soviet reference books and indeed from Soviet 
conversation. Her photographs were removed from the museum walls at the Kirov's 
ballet school, the Vaganova (though they have reappeared this year), and her 
growing fame, first as a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre and then 
as a guest star with London's Royal Ballet and Festival Ballet were unknown 
among her countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
But now she is a heroine. Demand for tickets to see her perform was so high 
that previously scheduled performances by others for today and Friday were 
suspended at Leningrad's 4,000-seat October Hall so that Makarova could repeat 
her Kirov triumph at the larger venue. 
</P>
<P>
And, ironically, though the ballet "Onegin," choreographed by the late British 
artist John Cranko, is based on a poem by Leningrad's most famous poet, 
Alexander Pushkin, with music adapted from works by the Russian composer 
Tchaikovsky, it had never been performed here because of its Western 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled to leave the Soviet Union three days after her final Kirov 
performance, the ballerina has asked to have her visa extended to remain here 
for an extra few days following her additional October Hall performances.

MCCARTNEY'S BEST NOT BACK IN THE U.S.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic: Paul McCartney, whose last album barely cracked the Top 30 in the 
States, has made one of the most entertaining LPs of his career, but you can't 
buy it in this country -- at least not officially. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the U.S.S.R." -- featuring playful McCartney treatments of songs 
associated with some of his own rock heroes, including Elvis Presley and Fats 
Domino -- was intended to be released only in the Soviet Union; a sort of 
good-will gesture in the age of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
But in a switch on the days when Beatles albums were only commercially 
available in the West and had to be smuggled into the Soviet Union, a few 
hundred copies of the album have been showing up in specialty record stores, 
especially in New York and London. 
</P>
<P>
As enthusiasm over the quality of "Back in the U.S.S.R" has spread, however, 
tapes of the album have begun circulating among Beatles collectors around the 
country. Record shops in Southern California known to deal in imports or 
collectors' items report numerous calls asking if the album is in stock. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious question: Will the response lead McCartney and his U.S. record 
company, Capitol, to make the album commercially available here? 
</P>
<P>
He and his advisers may be worried that the "oldies" album would distract 
attention from a collection of new McCartney expected this summer in connection 
with a possible tour. Then again, however, the album could whet appetites for 
the album and the tour. 
</P>
<P>
The answer Wednesday from both a McCartney spokesman in New York and the 
president of Capitol Records in Los Angeles: No U.S. release at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone connected with the album is delighted at the enthusiastic response 
we've been receiving, but there are absolutely no plans to release it in this 
country," Joe Dera, the former Beatle's U.S. publicist, said in a phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Added Capitol President David Berman, "I don't think it would be appropriate to 
release the album now, because we want to focus all our attention on the new 
McCartney album, which should be ready by May or June. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard four tracks from (the upcoming McCartney album) and it sounds 
brilliant, but it is in a contemporary vein -- not the sort of 'Basement 
Tapes'-style of this album." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said it might make sense at some future point, however, to release the 
album or a similar "McCartney plays the Rock Classics"-type album. John Lennon 
released a similar "oldies" package in 1975. Titled "Rock 'n' Roll," the album 
peaked at No. 6 on the U.S. sales charts. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the U.S.S.R" is a wonderfully refreshing collection for anyone with a 
love for early rock or, especially, the early Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
The tracks -- reportedly recorded during a two-day session in 1987 in London -- 
recall the innocence and enthusiasm that made the Beatles such a joyful force 
in the early '60s. The music is ragged in spots and the band doesn't always 
seem sure of the arrangements, but the spirit is delightful. Above all, it's 
disarming to hear McCartney, 46, having such a good time in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The album kicks off with McCartney's version of "Kansas City," the 
Leiber-Stoller tune that was also featured on one of the Beatles' early albums. 
The new collection then moves through an energetic treatment of Eddie Cochran's 
"Twenty Flight Rock" and on to a gutsy rendition of "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" that 
more closely recalls Elvis Presley's late '50s cover of the song than the 
original Lloyd Price hit. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Presley is the rock figure most often saluted in "Back in the U.S.S.R." 
McCartney not only includes three songs identified with Presley (the others are 
the blues-rocker "That's Alright, Mama" and the country novelty "Just 
Because"), but he sticks fairly close to Presley's vocal arrangement on the 
tracks. On most of the other songs, however, McCartney slips in his own, often 
playful vocal twists. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other artists saluted: Little Richard ("Lucille"), Fats Domino 
("Ain't That a Shame"), Bo Diddley ("Crackin' Up") and Sam Cooke ("Bring It on 
Home to Me"). 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise is a remake of "Don't Get Around Much Anymore," a Duke 
Ellington-Bob Russell collaboration that was originally a hit in the '40s for 
the Ink Spots and the Ellington orchestra. The song was revived in the rock era 
by "Tab Hunter and the Belmonts." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney seems to have the most fun on "Just Because," an old country tune 
that appeared on Presley's first solo album. You can almost imagine the 
ex-Beatle slipping into a pair of blue suede shoes before he stepped to the 
microphone to sing the colorful lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you know you make me spend all my money, honey 
</P>
<P>
 You laugh and call me ol' Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ooh, I'm tellin' you, baby, I'm through with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Because . . . well, well, just because. 
</P>
<P>
This is music made for fun, free from the concern over being measured or 
judged. The added irony is that fun alone in rock 'n' roll is often quite 
enough.

DANCERS TAKE 'SOLO FLIGHT' IN LACE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Racism and sexual ambiguity have always been part of choreographer Donald 
Byrd's life, but not his art. Indeed, he says he's kept these controversial 
issues away from his work with his company for fear of clouding 
"straightforward movement issues with the cult of personality." 
</P>
<P>
But that desire for discretion changed when, after nearly 15 years of 
choreographing dances for others, he created a dance for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The results were traumatic," he admits, referring to his "Face Changers," 
where he sashays around the stage in drag before performing percussive steps 
that mix ballet with African dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to hide behind the skill of my dancers," he confesses. "But all of a 
sudden, when I was alone, I had no choice but to hold a mirror up to my entire 
being and place that on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The process changed the way I make work for my company," Byrd admits, "Now 
it's become more visceral and intimate." 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone in finding that solo work rejuvenates and expands a 
choreographer's ability to create, albeit through painful reevaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, Mary Jane Eisenberg, Susan Rethorst and Yves Musard are featured in a 
modern-dance program titled "Solo Flight" at LACE from tonight through 
Saturday. These artists, nationally respected for leading moderate-sized, 
experimental companies, will step back from directorial roles to lend insights 
into the relationship between their inner lives and the subtle way a dance gets 
made. 
</P>
<P>
For Eisenberg, the process has bordered on what she calls "a kind of small 
death." She says that her latest piece, called "A Woman Must Keep Moving," 
centers on abrupt changes in her inner life that are so dramatic she likens 
them "to ritual decay and rebirth." 
</P>
<P>
Using spoken text, props, Balinese music and what she calls "gestural, 
non-balletic movement," Eisenberg says this performance artwork is a kind of 
"transformative ritual" that helps her deal with "psychic, physical, sexual and 
career changes" erupting in her life now. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Rethorst uses solo work in a similarly ritualistic way. Though she's 
known for making group dances -- she was awarded a Bessie Award for one in 1985 
-- she confesses that she works alone when "it's time to re-evaluate and 
transform the deep and mysterious mind/body connections" that have driven her 
since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Rethorst's dances often feature only women, and have been likened stylistically 
to Virginia Woolf's prose for their seemingly internal and poetic manner of 
constructing emotional and private languages. 
</P>
<P>
But even Rethorst experiences the dance equivalent of writer's block. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years back, I had a series of physical problems that I was working on," 
she explains. "I would place a limb somewhere and just look at it and think 
'Well, it makes a plane or a line or an angle. And I would ask myself in the 
most basic and deep way how these placements can be combined to make a dance 
that makes sense to me? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dialogue I worked out by myself in 'Twain,' " she says, referring to 
one of the dances she'll present at LACE. "The solo was a kind of research." 
</P>
<P>
Yves Musard, a French-born choreographer, sees "no distinction between research 
and dancing." In fact, he hopes that when audiences watch his figure contorting 
on stage, they are aware that he is "not so much performing for them," but 
"working something out for myself." 
</P>
<P>
"Audiences always think I am so serious and dark," he offers with a laugh, 
referring to his reputation for twisting his expressive face into Kafka-esque 
frowns while tumbling, jumping and slogging on the dance floor as if he were a 
peasant farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am really just concentrating on my steps," he adds. "My dances offer me 
one thing: knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Musard explains that there is no "separation between who I am, what I know and 
how I dance." And though he says that his solo work "Spain" may remind viewers 
of flamenco dancing and other Spanish references, it is not different from all 
his other pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little like a spider," he explains. "I go along and spin a web and 
the web is knowledge. My movements are about making my body able to perceive 
and feel and spell and write and learn what I don't always have the knowledge 
of but I know exists in me. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine making group works without having gone through this private 
work," he comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, when I work with other dancers," he adds, "it's no different. I ask them 
to concentrate and express something beyond themselves. I believe each is a 
soloist with his own way of moving, his own way to gain knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks very heavy sometimes to the audience, but it can be absorbing and 
powerful because the performer is at the edge of something -- whatever it is -- 
and that's a deep thing."

ALTERNATIVE THEATER PURSUES ITS GOALS WITH MIXED PAIR OF PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Steve Wilber and Kent Hawkins say their fledgling theater group, the Orange 
County Coalition of the Theatre Arts, has two goals: to showcase new and 
emerging writers and actors (many from Orange County) and to present works that 
are "art-oriented," meaning adventurous, or at least different from those that 
can be seen in most area playhouses. 
</P>
<P>
After a short trial run late last year, the coalition has started its first 
full season with a series of one-act performances on Sunday nights at the 
year-old Illusion's New View Theatre, a tiny but reasonably accommodating space 
in a Fullerton mini-mall. Both of the initial playlets, Andrew Lowery's "The 
Cult of Gwanda" and Max Espinosa's "3 for 1," meet the theater's manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean both are good. "3 for 1," despite some unevenness in theme 
and approach, is better written and better realized than the psycho/paranoia 
absurdist comedy "Gwanda." All in all, though, there is reason to smile over 
the coalition's entry into the local scene: Alternative voices and game plans 
can only add to the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
In "3 for 1" (directed by Steve Wilber), Espinosa examines the romantic 
headache experienced by a young writer (James Hoff) as he struggles over ways 
to approach an attractive woman at the office. Espinosa reveals the writer's 
character, insecurities and strengths by having actors represent the Freudian 
aspects of his personality, his Id (Andrew Lowery) and Ego (Christopher Wade). 
</P>
<P>
The setup is relatively trite, but Espinosa redeems things with a spate of 
clever, heartfelt dialogue that strikes a fairly comfortable balance between 
sentiment and humor. We may know what's coming when the writer's "internal" 
voices start talking back, vying for control: Lowery is the daring one who 
wants to boldly confess his feelings; Wade, who bruises easily, is a bit more 
restrained. But it all comes across naturally and vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
The play is aided by the capable performances, especially from Lowery, who is 
an electric shock of emotions and movement. 
</P>
<P>
As a playwright, however, Lowery is too indulgent for his own good. His antic, 
30-minute "Cult of Gwanda" (directed by Mason Malone) is original, all right, 
but to the point of being incomprehensible. Lowery apparently is making a 
statement about domestic paranoia and "alienation" (or so the program says), 
especially in Orange County. But his plot is mostly shadow lines without much 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
What we have is a husband (Robert Blankenship) who is a self-absorbed type with 
a streak of cruelty. His mousy, schizoid wife (Deirdre West) lives, it seems, 
for visits to the market, dreams about having a really good cup of coffee and 
has nightmares about a cannibalistic Gwanda cult. He and she ramble and rumble 
inside their messy home; sometimes an overhead light goes on and she 
inexplicably enjoys a St. Vitus dance. Newspapers keep stacking up in the 
hallway until he finally gets buried under them. 
</P>
<P>
Abstruse and silly stuff, even for the theater of the absurd. West does bring 
an amusingly manic aura to the proceedings, though, and Blankenship is, well, 
real freaky, man, which in this context is a compliment. 
</P>
<P>

FLAWS SHOW IN 'DIARY OF ANNE FRANK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one point in "The Diary of Anne Frank," a character tells Anne and her 
family that they have no real notion of what is happening outside their hiding 
place: The Nazi pogroms are in full goose-step throughout Europe, and even 
Dutch Jews are being led to the concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
There's a pause while they reflect on this, a confirmation of their fears. But 
soon enough it's back to the practical matters at hand: Where will this new 
arrival sleep? Will he eat too much food? How will he get along with everybody? 
How long does he have to stay? Survival outside is harrowing, but it can be an 
ordeal inside as well. 
</P>
<P>
There are several times when Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett's play, now in 
repertory at Rancho Santiago College's Professional Actors Conservatory, seems 
to only take an indirect interest in the Nazi nightmare that has forced the 
Franks and their friends, the Van Daans, into a cramped Amsterdam attic. 
</P>
<P>
What the writers found most compelling in 13-year-old Anne's diary were the 
ways that 3 years of self-imprisonment affected those involved, how the 
apparently normal, good people revealed their worst under the strain, and how 
the truly noble remained noble. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, along with food and creature comforts, patience becomes scarce 
-- for the audience as well as the characters. There are times when the play is 
trivial: Flare-ups over sleeping and smoking habits, Anne's gabbiness and Mrs. 
Van Daan's flirtations with Mr. Frank veer things into the cramped confines of 
the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, a young girl's mind would gravitate often toward the ordinary, but the 
emphasis here -- even if it's meant to contrast with the terrible reality on 
the outside, or to underscore how few people realized the extent of the German 
threat -- is drastic. Jerry McGonigle's direction makes matters worse: He tends 
to dwell on the daily doings and, in fact, amplifies them. 
</P>
<P>
McGonigle does move to a higher level in a few poignant passages that feature 
Susan Hamilton as Anne. When Anne is unable to burn the yellow Star of David 
patch that the Germans have forced her to wear, we feel her religious 
commitment and steadfast personality. When she giddily presents homemade 
Hanukkah presents to everyone, we see her joy, her wit and her love. 
</P>
<P>
But Hamilton, who looks at least 20, is hampered by having to play such a young 
girl. She tries to compensate with hyperactive bounding about, coy looks and an 
adolescent lilt to her voice, but most of the time it is all too arch. Not 
surprisingly, she approaches the later scenes, when she begins to have womanly 
feelings for 16-year-old Peter Van Daan, with more ease. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast varies in ability. Robert Allan Gray is a leaderly but 
gentle Mr. Frank, and Chuck O'Connor delivers as the not-so-gracious new 
arrival, Mr. Dussel. Brian Hickman is best of all as the shy, achingly 
introspective Peter. A sense of low-key struggle is generated by David C. 
Palmer's somber lighting, which complements Scott Nielsen's correctly confining 
set.

LOTS OF LAUGHS FROM A GLOOMY GUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Mendoza's act goes along like some sort of downshifting comedy express, 
careening from subject to subject (and sometimes from joke to joke) in a 
hit-and-run but ultimately hit-and-miss manner. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the misses would seem less glaring if some of the hits weren't so sharp 
and potent -- or if his material were rooted in a strong, definable point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
On some nights, in front of some crowds, his world-weary, just-say-no (to 
everything) cynicism might be sufficiently strong to bind together his 
freewheeling collection of lines and bits. But it didn't play that way Tuesday 
at the Irvine Improvisation, where he continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, no one is going to confuse Mendoza with one of those bland, 
interchangeable-parts comics who increasingly are littering the stand-up 
landscape. He definitely has an edge; his non-stop negativism helps ensure that 
-- though it's kind of like going to dinner with someone who finds a cloud in 
every silver lining. You're a little relieved when the meal ends. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding that edge is something of a mean streak. Noticing a man with very 
close-cropped hair near the stage, Mendoza said: "You've got some haircut 
there. Are you a mental patient or in the military?" Along with being rougher, 
Mendoza is also bluer than most Improv comics. 
</P>
<P>
Having said all that, though, it must be emphasized that some of Mendoza's 
stuff is very funny. His low-key, choppy delivery yields intermittent waves of 
laughter, as opposed to an ever-building response over the course of a set. 
He's a spare, trenchant writer, and his perpetual hangdog expression epitomizes 
deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
As if to telegraph the sarcasm-tinged indifference that would be pouring forth 
from that expressionless puss of his, his opening words Tuesday were: "Hi. How 
are you? You look good. Pleasure to be here. Real thrill." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later came the first of many segments that began "I hate." ("I hate 
people who wear contacts. They lose 'em (and) they think it's your job to find 
them.") The things that Mendoza hates are as wide-ranging as they are numerous, 
from perky people to kids ("they're like old people with energy"), to life 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
He also seems to hate extraneous words. Not only are most of his pieces 
eminently tight, but he also doesn't bother with segues much of the time. Which 
means there were sequences like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Ever wonder if illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?" Pause. 
"You know what the abbreviation for July is? J-U-L. You've gotta be in a 
hurry." Pause. "I saw an ad in the L.A. Times that said 'If you have a hard 
time making decisions, call us at 279-8483 or 569'." He didn't need to finish 
the second number; the laugh had already come. 
</P>
<P>
Such staccato bursts of whimsy helped offset the set's philosophical 
underpinnings, which hold Mendoza up as an incurable Gloomy Gus, a fatalist who 
sees plenty of things wrong, but not much hope or joy. 
</P>
<P>
He articulated this fatalism after bumming a cigarette from someone in the 
front row and lighting up: "I like smoking. Smoking's great. Keeps me from 
jogging. . . . They say if you smoke, it knocks off 10 years of your life. It's 
the last 10. So what do you miss -- the drooling years?" 
</P>
<P>
He took some brief detours into absurdist territory. In a section on television 
and film, he revealed that his "all-time favorite movie was Alfred Hitchcock's 
'The Birds.' I saw it with my older brother. We got home that night. I went to 
bed. He opened all the windows and poured croutons on me." 
</P>
<P>
Quite early in the show (in case his style or accent had left any doubt that he 
hails from New York), he said: "I grew up in New York. Ever seen a New Yorker 
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation." Mendoza leaned over, as if speaking to 
someone unconscious on a sidewalk. "Get up before you (bleeping) die." 
</P>
<P>
The 55-minute set could have stood more interplay between Mendoza and the 
crowd. For one thing, in a running exchange with an Algerian audience member 
and others, he proved quite comfortable and adept at creating something from 
the moment. For another, because he is good -- and surprisingly quick -- such 
exchanges would break him out of his predominantly static modus operandi, 
putting an energetic spin on the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza is headlining a solid, diverse bill that also includes Rob Schneider 
(who's been on "Letterman" a couple of times) and Mark Brazil. Tonight only, 
transplanted Texan Bill Engvall will headline; Mendoza will do an abbreviated 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Improv is at 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Show times: 8 p.m. Thursday and 
Sunday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Friday, 8 and 10:30 p.m. Saturday. Tickets: $7 to 
$10. Information: (714) 854-5455.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ABORTION RULING BY SUPREME COURT HAD AN UNLIKELY CATALYST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're going to be reading and hearing a lot this year about Roe vs. Wade, the 
1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The current Supreme Court plans to review that decision and President Bush has 
indicated that his Administration will push hard for repeal. And last week, a 
story in the Calendar section of The Times carried the announcement by the 
president of NBC-TV that the network will offer a TV movie based on the life of 
the "Jane Roe" in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
She's an Oklahoman whose real name is Norma McCovey and she is one of the most 
unlikely humans imaginable to have been the catalyst for such a landmark 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief period, I knew Norma McCovey very well -- or thought I did -- and I 
was startled by the statement in the Calendar story attributed to an NBC 
executive that "she lied" when she said her pregnancy grew out of a rape. I 
have on tape 20 minutes of the most graphic description of that rape this side 
of "The Accused," and if McCovey indeed made it up, she should be running NBC's 
entertainment division instead of Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
I met her a few months after the original Supreme Court decision came down -- 
and many years before her identity was known publicly. I was sent to Dallas by 
Good Housekeeping magazine to do a profile on the two young women attorneys who 
argued Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
They were a fascinating pair, both under 30, both dealing with their first 
major case and the only two practicing women attorneys to graduate from the 
University of Texas Law School in 1965. But there the similarities stopped. 
Sarah Weddington -- who later became President Jimmy Carter's protocol chief 
and is presently carving out a political career in Texas -- was politically 
liberal, aggressive and strongly feminist. Linda Coffee was quiet, conservative 
and strongly influenced by her Baptist upbringing. But both young women felt 
strongly that -- as Coffee expressed it to me -- "legally and morally, this is 
a matter of individual conscience. This ruling doesn't require any doctor to 
perform an abortion or any patient to have one." 
</P>
<P>
Norma McCovey came into the view of these two young attorneys when she went to 
a doctor in Dallas, told him she had been raped and asked for an abortion. He 
said that wasn't possible under Texas law and referred her to an adoption 
attorney, who knew Weddington and Coffee were looking for a case to test the 
Texas abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
After several years of volunteering in a problem pregnancy center, Coffee and 
Weddington were determined to do everything in their power to make abortion a 
matter of "individual conscience" for women, and they filed an action on behalf 
of McCovey challenging the constitutionality of the Texas abortion law -- a 
law, incidentally, that she had obeyed, bearing the child and then giving it up 
for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
McCovey had been born in a small Oklahoma town where her father, an Army 
technician, was stationed at the time. As she recounted it to me, she had a 
frightful childhood, wandering from school to school and town to town in an 
angry and stressful household. She was 10 when her parents divorced, and she 
said that after being rejected by both, she quit school at 16, found a job and 
moved out. She admitted frequent trouble with juvenile authorities in Dallas -- 
where both parents had settled -- as a truant and runaway. 
</P>
<P>
As a carhop in a Dallas drive-in, she was swept away by a young customer who 
told her he was a prospering rock singer. They married when McCovey was still 
16 and went to Hollywood. She said that when she told her husband she was 
pregnant, he beat her and she used a few dollars she had hidden and bought a 
bus ticket back to Dallas. After being persuaded to sign the child over to her 
mother and stepfather, she said, they kicked her out and she joined a traveling 
carnival. That's where she was raped, she told me. 
</P>
<P>
At the time we talked, she was living in Dallas with a woman friend who was 
enormously protective of her and suspicious of me. It took a long time to win 
their confidence, but once that happened, the three of us talked at great 
length. Now it appears she might have been fictionalizing at least part of what 
she told me. Or is it NBC she's kidding? 
</P>
<P>
She wrote to me for a couple of years after the story appeared. This woman who 
had never been allowed a sense of importance was terribly proud of the role she 
played in winning women the freedom to control their own bodies. "I'm glad," 
she told me, "that women now have the chance to choose not to have a child, 
regardless of how they got in that condition. I'm glad I had a part in 
providing them that option -- the chance to start over." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Weddington came to UC Irvine last year to speak, and we renewed our 
acquaintance. She told me Norma had sold her story to NBC but said there was 
some confusion in facts that needed to be cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
The Times story quoted the NBC spokesman as saying that "we have been very 
careful, very diligent in giving voice to both (pro and con abortion) 
positions." I hope they haven't been so diligent that they lose the impact of 
Norma McCovey's few moments on the center stage of history.

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: CHEF DEALS WITH YAK SCARCITY JUST FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erich Pfeiffer gets a yuk -- better make that yak -- out of cooking and sharing 
recipes for delectable dishes he has discovered on treks to such faraway places 
as Nepal and India. 
</P>
<P>
The German-born Mission Viejo resident, an engineer at Northrop, is deeply 
involved in trekking -- prowling around mountains without roads or trails, led 
by native guides who generally do all the cooking. 
</P>
<P>
It was on such a 23-day sojourn to Nepal that Pfeiffer first sampled the dish 
he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys: Tibetan meat pies called momos. It was, he 
said, the staple of the party at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
He bakes his version, but the natives steam theirs. He also makes it easier by 
using prepared crescent-roll dough, instead of creating it from scratch, and by 
substituting lean ground beef for chopped yak meat, which Pfeiffer said he has 
difficulty finding in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The dish has become a particular favorite at local Sierra Club potluck dinners. 
Pfeiffer said he and his wife, Kathleen, must sample the momos at home or do 
without at such functions because "they're always the first things to go, while 
we're still way back in the line." 
</P>
<P>
The Pfeiffers, who have been married a little more than a year, met at a Sierra 
Club function. She backpacks with him but eschews the overseas treks. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from her accusing him of "always using too much vinegar in his German 
dishes," she is his biggest culinary fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's potato dumplings, real sauerkraut, chicken a la Erich or one of 
his famous sauces," she wrote Guys &amp; Galleys, "it's bound to be authentic, 
well prepared and actually fairly easy for anyone to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 13-month-old granddaughter even smacks her lips when she sees Erich in the 
kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer's interest in cooking took root, he said, in a makeshift bomb shelter 
in Stuttgart, Germany, during Allied air raids during World War II. "Our root 
cellar was our shelter," he said, "and my mother kept her collection of 
cookbooks just outside the door, and they were the only thing I had to read 
while we were in there." 
</P>
<P>
There was almost no food -- then or for a few years after the war's end -- but 
that only intensified his interest in cooking (and eating) the best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his bachelor years, he honed those skills while earning a doctorate in 
electronic engineering in Stuttgart. He holds patents on several inventions and 
has written several college textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ERICH PFEIFFER'S MOMOS (TIBETAN MEAT PIES) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1/3 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1 container crescent roll dough 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Saute onion and garlic in vegetable oil until slightly browned. Add meat, 
stir-fry until done and drain off most fat. Add seasonings and stir-fry a few 
more minutes. Sprinkle flour over mixture and add water. Reduce heat and cook 
for a few more minutes. Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes, then separate 
into 8 equal portions. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Separate crescent roll dough into triangular sections. Sprinkle with flour and 
roll them out until they have increased in size about 50%. Place filling in 
center, fold over tips of triangles and place on cookie sheet with tips on 
bottom. Bake in 350-degree oven until golden brown (about 10 to 15 minutes). 
</P>

It was a G'Day Sunday when Opera Pacific welcomed Aussies Dame Joan Sutherland 
and her dashing husband, Richard Bonynge, to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terribly like Sydney," said Bonynge, drinking in a sun-dappled Newport 
Bay from a locale most countians only dream of: the emerald knoll that fronts 
the bay-front Harbor Island manse of Martha and Dr. Hansel Benvenuti. 
</P>
<P>
Such is life for members of the Impresario Circle -- opera buffs who each 
donate $5,000 annually to Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after a yacht glide-cum-brunch on the bay, they got to hobnob with 
Luciano Pavarotti in his posh hotel suite. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it was food on land with the diva and her husband for guests such as 
Renee Segerstrom (impeccably turned out in a floral Yves Saint Laurent suit and 
lapis lazuli baubles) -- hubby Henry could not attend -- and OP board 
chairwoman Floss Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
After a champagne reception that included favorites plinked on a baby grand 
(and the chance to ogle the Benvenutis' Baccarat and Lalique collection), 
guests swept into the dining room for brunch. The artful array of breads, 
fruits, eggs in puff pastry and potatoes tossed with caramelized onions was 
worthy of a still life. Dessert? A tangerine souffle poked with white chocolate 
curls and crystallized tangerine zest. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland, attired in a frilly silk, dined al fresco beside Glenn and Dottie 
Stillwell, co-chairwoman with Jean Lucas of Impresario Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Of "Norma," the opera in which she will make her Orange County debut in the 
title role Feb. 11 at the Performing Arts Center, Sutherland said: "It's a 
difficult role, but one I love doing. I think I've sung more performances of it 
than any other singer in this century. It's rather like a comfortable pair of 
old shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the social agenda for Impresario Circle: a black-tie reception with 
Sutherland and her conductor husband at the Center Club after their premiere 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Faces in the brunch crowd: Ed Schumacher; David Di Chiera; Jeanette and Harold 
Segerstrom; Frederick and Michelle Rohe (chic in a navy Chanel coatdress); 
Walter Henry with artist Maria del Carmen Calvo; John and Kathleen Rhynerson; 
Jolene and Richard Engel, and Jean Cronin Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
(Note for opera buffs who want to meet the diva: She will attend an autograph 
session Feb. 12 at 2 p.m. at the Rizzoli bookstore in South Coast Plaza.) 
</P>
<P>
Teed off: "That little white ball took precedence," said singer Diahann 
Carroll, pretending to pout on Friday night at her post-performance bash at the 
Four Seasons hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, looking frankly sensual in see-through midnight lace, was talking to 
about 60 guests gathered to celebrate her and husband Vic Damone's show at the 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Damone, she explained, couldn't attend the supper party hosted by boutique 
wizard Amen Wardy because he'd "made the cut" that day at the AT&amp;T golf 
tourney in Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And he had a plane to catch back to golf country before John Wayne Airport 
closed at 10:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Carroll, a bouncy charmer, made enough music for both of them. 
"Your Center is so wonderful!" she gushed. "Whoever designed it should create 
them all over the country!" 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Damone had made it up to Wardy in the show. He'd talked about the 
super salesman almost as much as he'd talked about Irving Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't she beautiful?" Damone asked theatergoers as Carroll appeared in a 
frosted lace gown. "Diahann buys her clothes at Amen Wardy. She takes me 
shopping there and we spend soooooo much money!" 
</P>
<P>
And, later, after Carroll again stunned the audience in yet another bespangled 
Bob Mackie: "Amen Wardy. I wish I'd never met him!" 
</P>
<P>
Spicing up supper were other members of the starry set who'd bused down from 
the Hills of Beverly: Jackie Collins (yup, Joan's sis, who said they were late 
for the gig because their bus had to make a "Stolichnaya stop"), in siren red 
and Hollywood smiles; zany Allan Carr, producer of this year's Academy Awards 
("You're going to see more stars than ever," he promised. "Everybody from Alice 
Fay to River Phoenix!"); Hollywood Reporter columnist George Christy, rakish in 
a jaunty hat and white silk stole ("Everybody keeps asking me if I'm Truman 
Capote," he said. "Don't they know he's dead?") and clothing designer Nolan 
Miller ("Dynasty") who had this advice for women who want to look simply 
fabulous: "Don't try quite so hard. You'll look like you dressed for 
Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
Also among the guests: Susan and Tim Strader, who had just attended the 
Commerce Bank bash across the hall; Lillian Fluor; Willa Dean and William Lyon; 
Maria Crutcher; Alex and Barbara Bowie, and Kit and Stephen Toth. 
</P>
<P>
An Olympic affair: "Let's just say it's been an experience," said a weary Bruce 
McLean of the chairmanship he shared with his wife, Deborah, for Friday night's 
"Golden Gala" on behalf of the American Diabetes Assn. "Something you're not 
sure you want to have more than once." 
</P>
<P>
McLean was kidding. Really, he said, he volunteered to chair the affair, held 
at Le Meridien, because it was "needed." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've twisted the arm of every friend I've got." 
</P>
<P>
It paid off. Friday's party drew more than 200 guests and a netted more than 
$40,000. Johnny Grant was emcee. Jose Feliciano entertained. And a bevy of 1988 
Olympic medalists from Orange County were honored at the event. Among them: 
Janet Evans, Gregg Barton, Brett Barberie, Jimmy Kim, Doug Kimbell, Norman 
Bellingham and James Bergeson.

LAS AMIGAS' GUARDIAN ANGELS ARE WELL-DRESSED

Las Amigas de San Jose, a support group for St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, drew 
a crowd of 200 to the Anaheim Hilton on Saturday to see a dozen California 
Angels and their wives model casual and evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Cocktails, dinner, fashion show, dancing -- same package as last year, at the 
same price ($125 per couple). 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Amigas nabbed TV sportscaster Fred Roggin for the emcee job, and 
he unleashed an irreverent commentary that played like a comedy routine. Roggin 
ragged the ballplayers as they paraded self-consciously down the runway, and 
they responded by mugging, giggling and showing off. 
</P>
<P>
This year, emcee duties were more conservatively divvied between Angels' radio 
announcer Al Conin and Barbara Roberson (she works for Santa Ana/Mainplace, 
which provided the clothes). Conin reported on the players' careers, Roberson 
described the outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Fun for guests included the opportunity of chatting with the athletes before a 
steak and salmon dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Mark McLemore described his off-field fashion style as "sweaters 
and baggies . . . comfortable clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Backup catcher Darrell Miller was asked about his reputation as the GQ Man of 
the ballclub (this insight from Conin during cocktail hour). 
</P>
<P>
Miller laughed. "Well, if that's so, it's only because of this lady," he said, 
nodding to his wife, Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"He may get beat up in the parking lot," joked Kelly, "but he leaves home 
looking good." 
</P>
<P>
Arlyne Parrish, wife of catcher Lance Parrish, also admitted to taking an 
active role in her hubby's haberdashery. Asked if the big guy likes to slouch 
around the house in sweats, Arlyne responded: "No, I don't let him." Around the 
Parrishes' Diamond Bar home, said Arlyne, it's "jeans and boots once in a 
while, but mostly I got him into all this surfer junk now." 
</P>
<P>
The benefit raised an estimated $20,000 to help expand the hospital's surgical 
facilities, according to event chairwoman Kathy Cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Among those organizing the fund-raiser were Rina Santora, Jana Burwell, Suanne 
Karlinski, Karen Buttacavoli, Judi Allen, Debbie Johnston, Judy Heric, Shirley 
Edelman and Jan Cassen.

A caption in Wednesday's Times misidentified a building on South Orange Grove

of the victims were found in a closet in an adjacent building, where the fire 
began before spreading next door.

President Bush, like his predecessor, has begun his presidency with the 
approval of a majority of the American people, according to a Gallup poll. Less 
than a week after he took office, 51% approve of Bush's job performance while 
6% disapprove. High levels of uncertainty are characteristic of early surveys 
of incoming presidents, but an exceptionally large number, 43%, have not yet 
formed opinions about Bush, the poll said. President Reagan also received a 51% 
approval rating early in his tenure. But Reagan left office last month riding 
an unprecedented wave of popularity, and the high rate of people undecided on 
Bush may reflect some public uncertainty that he can match Reagan.

Former Democratic Rep. John Jenrette of South Carolina, who lost his seat in 
Congress after he was convicted in the 1980 FBI Abscam operation, won a delay 
in his trial on shoplifting charges. Jenrette, a disbarred lawyer and 
recovering alcoholic, asked Judge Thomas Rothrock of Fairfax County General 
District Court in Virginia for a delay so he could seek medical treatment. 
Rothrock agreed to postpone the proceedings until Feb. 23. Jenrette attorney 
Warren McLain said his client suffers from ulcers and may also have caught the 
flu. Jenrette was visiting friends in Virginia when he was arrested for 
shoplifting at a Marshall's store.

ASIAN KEPT OFF JURY, COURT UPSETS CONVICTION IN TEENS' ROAD DEATHS

In a scathing opinion, a state appellate court today overturned the murder 
conviction of a man who killed two Costa Mesa teen-agers in an auto accident as 
he fled from police, ruling that the prosecutor discriminated against Asians in 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that the exclusion of a 
Vietnamese immigrant because of what the prosecutor felt was his inability to 
understand English was illegally based on a racial stereotype. The court voided 
the two second-degree murder convictions of Ruben Valle, who is serving two 
prison sentences of 15 years to life in prison for the 1986 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Dep. Dist. Atty. Richard King's questioning of prospective jurors was the 
subject of scathing criticism in the appeals court opinion, written by Justice 
Edward J. Wallin. King showed bias, the court concluded, by disqualifying Tuoc 
Vo, a mechanic and Vietnamese immigrant. King stated that in his experience, 
"members of the Oriental race" have difficulty learning English and "serious 
problems in understanding words that have abstract meanings to them."

SENATORS DELAY TOWER VOTE AFTER NEW CHARGES EMERGE; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL WILL CHECK DATA WITH FBI

Senators moving to check "additional information" with the FBI postponed a vote 
today on John Tower's nomination as defense secretary, a step that sparked 
speculation about his confirmation chances. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and senior Republican John 
W. Warner of Virginia announced at a committee session dealing with an 
unrelated matter that more data has come to the panel about Tower and that some 
members want a further look at the former Texas senator's file. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman and I have been looking at some additional information that has 
come to the attention of the two of us . . . and we feel it important to see 
that each one of these bits of information is carefully checked out," Warner 
said. "(Nunn) and I will be meeting with the FBI and others today." 
</P>
<P>
Neither senator would elaborate and both quickly left the committee room, but 
Warner cautioned: "I wouldn't read anything into it at this time. . . . I would 
not attach any credibility or non-credibility to the information." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grilled on Private Life 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who had said earlier that a vote was probable today, said that he now 
does not know when the committee may vote -- and that the full Senate would be 
unlikely to be able to take up the nomination until next week. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, 63, had endured four days of public and private hearings before the 
committee he once chaired, hearings that saw him grilled closely about his work 
as a defense consultant after he left the Senate four years ago and about 
allegations that he was a womanizer and a heavy drinker. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings had apparently concluded Wednesday with his public declaration 
that he has no alcohol problem. The Texan conceded, "I feel like I'm glad it's 
the end of the hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's announcement of the postponement came on the same day that the 
Washington Post's gossip column carried a report on Tower's behavior at a 
Wednesday lunch at a posh hotel with girlfriend Dorothy Heiser. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Tower "playfully lunged at Heiser, his arms reaching toward her 
under the table, and said, 'I'm going to fondle you.' She gave a little shriek 
and jumped slightly and said, 'Don't you do that.' He stopped and they resumed 
eating." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn had suggested some discomfort with the nomination late Wednesday, telling 
reporters after the hearings that he had not made up his own mind. But the 
chairman nonetheless said then that he expected Tower to win confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had and continue to have concerns not on the basis of his competence" 
but on the basis of his private life and conflict-of-interest questions, Nunn 
said. "I am wrestling with those." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich said Tuesday that he had seen Tower 
intoxicated and in the company of women other than his wife "on numerous 
occasions," but when called into a private meeting he was unable to convince 
senators that he had anything more than "hearsay" evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The twice-divorced Tower, whose 1987 divorce was particularly acrimonious, was 
offered the opportunity by Nunn to respond publicly to his critics Wednesday 
after he, too, spoke privately with the committee.

BUSH MAY APPROVE SALE OF TANKS TO ARAB COUNTRIES

President Bush has informed Congress that he may authorize the sale of 315 
front-line Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia and 200 to Kuwait while providing a 
third Arab country, the United Arab Emirates, with 40 F-18 fighter jets, 
sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt, meanwhile, would get 150 Hawk missiles and Israel 200 shoulder-fired 
Stingers, while Jordan again would receive no American weapons this year, said 
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The potential Arab purchases could touch off another row with Israel's 
supporters in Congress, who were successful during the Carter and Reagan 
administrations in blocking U.S. sales that were considered threatening to the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
But the skillful management of James A. Baker III, then the White House chief 
of staff and now secretary of state, and other Reagan Administration operatives 
overcame stubborn resistance to the sale of AWACs radar planes to Saudi Arabia 
that the Senate approved 52 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
The Abrams tank is considered the best in the world. Recently, U.S. and 
Egyptian officials completed arrangements for co-production in Egypt with the 
aim of providing the Egyptian army with them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaks Discouraged 
</P>
<P>
The weapons list sent to Congress is classified. Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), 
chairman of the House foreign affairs subcommittee that deals with the Middle 
East, is understood to have cautioned other members of Congress and staff aides 
not to leak any of the items. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House, in a cover letter, informed Congress that the 
Saudis were in the process of deciding whether to request U.S. or European 
fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade, the sources said.

QUAYLE ASSAILS CARTER'S ORTEGA TALK AND TAKES A JAB AT REAGAN

Vice President Dan Quayle today criticized former President Jimmy Carter for 
holding discussions with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, saying "it has a 
chance of complicating matters." 
</P>
<P>
He also took a back-handed jab at former President Ronald Reagan, indicating he 
occasionally used excuses to duck out of talking with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States refuses to talk with Ortega, Quayle said: 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, when you have a former President meeting with heads of state we 
don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters," he told reporters 
following the inauguration of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Otto Reich said Quayle, midway through a three-day visit to 
Latin America, would not meet here with Ortega. The Nicaraguan leader shared a 
peace proposal in a meeting Wednesday with Carter and Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Reich said Quayle had no plans to meet with Carter, although the two did speak 
briefly Wednesday night at a reception. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and the U.S. delegation are trying to learn more about the peace 
proposal Ortega brought with him to Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had talked to President Bush since arriving here Wednesday, Quayle 
noted that Bush had a cold and laryngitis. "Reagan used to use that (as an 
excuse) not to have press conferences, but it won't be in this Administration," 
he said.

Runaway railroad cars derailed and exploded early today, knocking out power to 
37,000 people in and around Helena and forcing the evacuation of thousands in 
wind chills of 70 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48 a.m. explosion, which 
rocked houses up to three miles away, overturned cars and shattered windows in 
a nearby college and homes. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in an open area near three major power lines, and 
authorities believed that at least one had been severed. Electricity was 
restored to half the city within 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters fought a blaze near a railroad tanker containing hydrogen 
peroxide, which threatened to set off a second explosion, Police Capt. Bud 
Carbis said. The fire flared up and spread to a boxcar containing plastic pipe, 
releasing hydrochloride gas, which Carbis described as "very noxious." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities urged "everybody in town to stay inside," Carbis said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students at Carroll 
College, were evacuated from a square-mile area around the blast zone, 
officials said. Evacuees went to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the 
National Guard armory and schools, which were already closed because of the 
cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
The blast initially knocked out power to all of the state capital, which has 
about 27,000 people, and the surrounding Helena Valley, population 10,000.

The House Judiciary Committee, in a rare move, today ousted the chairman of its 
immigration subcommittee, veteran Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli (D-Ky.) in favor of 
fourth-term Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
Mazzoli, a 10-term congressman from Louisville who headed the subcommittee for 
eight years, authored with Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) the sweeping 
Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform of 1986. Democratic discontent with Mazzoli 
had been growing over the way he ran the panel, according to Morrison. Mazzoli 
was ousted on a 16-5 secret ballot of Democratic members. Morrison, who was 
next in line of seniority, was voted in 21 to 1.

Racial slurs and obscenities spray-painted earlier this week on two buildings 
and a fence at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site have been removed, 
officials said Wednesday.

<P>
Pink and blue fluorescent paint was sprayed on the carriage house behind 
Lincoln's home, an adjacent shed and a white wooden fence behind the shed. 
Meters and an air conditioner also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Because the damage occurred on federal property, the FBI was investigating, 
acting site Supt. Larry Blake said. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln home, the only house the nation's 16th President ever owned, was

RETAIL SALES HELPED BY UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mild weather helped big retailers ring up good sales in January, and analysts 
said the gains reported today might have been larger if the stores had more 
merchandise to sell. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts noted that last month's gains by the nation's largest general 
retailers occurred during a month that typically is the least important on the 
industry's calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that at least part of 
the sales increase came in comparison with a relatively weak January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the sales have come in very good for the month -- better, 
I think, than anyone would have expected," observed Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Edelman also said, "January is such an insignificant month. January's a 
cleanup month after Christmas. If you had a couple of good days, that makes a 
big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Unseasonably warm weather over much of the country in January probably 
encouraged shoppers and added to sales volumes. During some years past, severe 
winter conditions have kept consumers from venturing out to stores. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe Greenstein of the investment firm Bear Stearns said the tight 
inventories probably depressed January sales. One leading department store 
chain informed him that it had to scramble to locate merchandise to stock 
stores during January. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if there was more inventory, sales would have been better," 
Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Goods were sharply depleted during December, when business was even better than 
retailers had expected. Also, stores didn't have much left over after Christmas 
because they already had been holding inventories down to avoid having to slash 
prices to move unsold merchandise later. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers adopted the strategy after two years of sluggish sales in which 
consumers devoted more of their discretionary income to necessities and 
services and tried to reduce their high debt levels. Analysts and economists 
expect this trend to continue this year.

HOUSING SALES EDGE UP; STRONG ECONOMY CREDITED

Despite an upward trend in mortgage rates, sales of new single-family houses 
edged up nearly 1% last year to 677,000 units, the Commerce Department said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Economists, noting that the housing market is usually acutely sensitive to 
interest rate changes, attributed the increase to the strong U.S. economy, 
which created 3.7 million jobs and boosted personal income 7.5% last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher level of consumer confidence is the major reason for the increase," 
said David Berson, chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
(Fannie Mae). "As long as employment prospects are good and income is strong, 
people are going to continue spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's house sales, the highest since 1986, were surprising for many 
economists because of the shaky start the market had immediately after the 
October, 1987, stock market crash. Also, after six years of economic expansion, 
much of the pent-up demand for new houses has been satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market crash had far less effect on the economy than had been feared, 
and the housing market is shifting away from first-time buyers and toward 
homeowners wanting to move up to larger houses, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The shift toward move-up buyers is also a key reason for the increase in the 
average sales price of new single-family houses in 1988 to $138,700 from 
$127,200 in 1987, economists said. The median sales price of new single-family 
houses also rose to $112,500 in 1988 from $104,500 in 1987.

ysler Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings jumped 23.8% higher than the same period 
last year, the auto maker announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's third-largest auto maker reported an after-tax profit of $433.6 
million, or $1.85 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That compared 
with earnings of $350.2 million, or $1.57 a share, in the fourth quarter of 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue totaled $9.69 billion, up 13.6% from $8.53 billion in the corresponding 
1987 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Chrysler had a profit of $1.05 billion, or $4.66 cents a 
share, down from $1.29 billion, or $5.90 a share, in 1987. Revenue for the year 
rose to $35.5 billion from $29.3 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 results were reduced by $93.1 million due to a $150-million charge for 
previously announced plant closings in Chrysler's Acustar parts subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said the company achieved its key objectives 
during the year, including completion of its merger with American Motors Corp., 
increasing its car and truck market share and finishing the year with strong 
earnings, "which moves us into 1989 with a lot of momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said its share of the U.S. car market rose to 11.3% from 10.8% in 
1987. Chrysler's share of the truck market rose to 19.4% from 18.3% in 1987.

Key had been scheduled for an arbitration hearing Feb. 10 in Chicago before 
Richard Bloch. Key had been asking for $1.35 million and the Blue Jays had been

Canadian national weightlifting coach Andrzej Kulesza denied today that he 
supplied urine to four Canadian weightlifters in a bid to cheat in drug tests 
before last year's Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, former team member Jacques Demers told a federal inquiry into 
drugs in amateur sport that he was told Kulesza and former assistant coach 
Raphael Zuffellato had provided "clean" urine to athletes in danger of testing 
positive for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two sides of the story," said Kulesza, interviewed during a break in 
inquiry proceedings today. "(Wednesday) was Jacques' story. When it's my 
chance, I will tell my story." 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to mask the fact that the athletes were taking steroids was 
unsuccessful and the four were caught. Demers' testimony was admitted despite 
objections by lawyers that it was based on hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
Kulesza's lawyer, Joel Silcoff, who cross-examined Demers today, said his 
client will appear before the inquiry next week and will deny Demers' charges.

ing official Martin Denkin lost his power to approve or turn down bouts in 
California when he was placed on administrative leave today by the state 
Consumer Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
Denkin, assistant executive officer of the state Athletic Commission, will 
remain on leave pending the outcome of a Los Angeles County district attorney's 
investigation into accusations of extortion, said Shirley Chilton, secretary of 
state and consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
The action came less than a week after the San Jose Mercury News reported that 
Denkin is being investigated for allegedly extorting money from boxing managers 
in return for furthering the careers of their fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Chilton, a member of Gov. George Deukmejian's Cabinet, has authority over the 
Consumer Affairs Department, which oversees the Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Fippin, chief of the division of administration for the Consumer Affairs 
Department, said Denkin will continue to receive a salary. Denkin is also being 
investigated by the Consumer Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one person yet has faced me," Denkin told the Mercury News in a telephone 
interview from his home outside Los Angeles. "I've been crucified throughout 
the world."
