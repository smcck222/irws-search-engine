GRACE HAYES, 93; NIGHTCLUB HOSTESS IN 1940S AND '50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grace Hayes, who had aspirations of film stardom but ended up a prominent 
nightclub hostess in the 1940s and 1950s, died Wednesday at a convalescent home 
in Las Vegas. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, Mrs. Hayes, mother of Peter Lind Hayes, operated the Las Vegas 
Strip's Red Rooster. Earlier she had operated the Grace Hayes Lodge in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In their heyday, the clubs catered to customers ranging from billionaire Howard 
Hughes to gangster Bugsy Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Hayes lived in a ranch-style bungalow on the rear of the Las Vegas 
property, which now is being torn down to make way for a resort. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Hayes married at age 17, sang in San Francisco nightclubs, appeared as a 
singing comedienne in vaudeville and gravitated to Hollywood in the 1930s. She 
made a handful of films, including "Rainbow Over Broadway," "Always Leave Them 
Laughing" and "Caged." She was seen as Mickey Rooney's mother in "Babes in 
Arms" in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
The previous year, by selling some jewelry and borrowing the rest of the $8,000 
needed, she opened the Grace Hayes Lodge.

ELAINE DE KOONING, 68; NOTED ARTIST, COMMENTATOR, PROFESSOR

Elaine de Kooning, an artist whose works ranged from realism to abstraction for 
more than 30 years, died Wednesday of lung cancer. She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
She entered Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia in November and she was 
diagnosed as having cancer. She had been hospitalized in New York the last two 
weeks and died early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say I'm an escape artist," she told art critic Rose Slivka when asked 
to describe her style. "Style is something I've always tried to avoid. I'm more 
interested in character." 
</P>
<P>
Her works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim 
Museum in New York and are featured in other institutions throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
She was married to Willem de Kooning, a renowned abstractionist, for 45 years. 
Asked by a Times art writer in 1984 how she reconciled their careers, she said 
she never believed she operated in his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working in his light," she said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she established herself both in and out of her studio, as art 
commentator and as a professor at the University of New Mexico, University of 
Pennsylvania and Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Elaine Catherine Fried in 1920. She attended Hunter College, then 
switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in Manhattan, where she found 
friends active in the abstract and realism movement. 
</P>
<P>
She met De Kooning about that time, and they were married Dec. 9, 1943, about 
five years after she had become his private student. 
</P>
<P>
Her first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in New York. Her 
most recent work was inspired by Paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in 
France and Altamira in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
When she was taken with a theme, as she was with the caves, or with the first 
bullfight she saw three decades ago, she drew series of watercolor sketches 
before immersing herself in a single picture. 
</P>
<P>
She also was considered a talented portraitist and was commissioned to do two 
portraits of John F. Kennedy. One hangs in the Truman Library in Independence, 
Mo., the other in the Kennedy Library in Cambridge, Mass.

Kaypro Corp. has revised its first-quarter earnings report. As a result, the 
firm is reporting a net loss of $904,926, contrasted with the previously 
reported earnings of $2.6 million. The revised figure compares to a net loss of 
$615,677 during the year-ago quarter. The Solano Beach-based computer company 
said an item that had been reported as $3.2 million in net other income had 
been restated as a net other expense of $290,517.

Tenneco's fourth-quarter earnings rebounded from a loss a year ago, helped 
largely by an $867-million gain from the sale of its oil and gas businesses. 
The Houston-based diversified industrial company reported net income of $598 
million, contrasted with a loss of $176 million in the 1987 period. Revenue was 
$3.6 billion, up 13%. For all 1988, net income was $822 million, contrasted 
with a $218-million loss in 1987. Revenue totaled $13.2 billion, up 11%.

International Lease Finance Corp.'s 1988 profit dropped 15% to $43 million. The 
Beverly Hills firm said the results were due in part to lower gains on flight 
equipment marketing and delays in deliveries of aircraft from McDonnell Douglas 
and Fokker. In addition, tighter competitive conditions existing at the time of 
certain lease transactions during 1987 resulted in lower overall operating 
margins for 1988, the firm said.

DAVID NELSON SOCIETY: TRADITIONAL S.D. LIVES AT CHARITY BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Saturday night every January, the doors to a time tunnel swing open briefly 
at the Hotel del Coronado to admit a fair slice of Old San Diego and snippets 
of the new. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion is the Charity Ball, which theoretically is an annual happening 
but, in fact, is more a single event served up in annual installments. The 
series began in 1909 and looks likely to continue more or less forever. Think 
of the Charity Ball as a space-time continuum that allows its sponsors and 
patrons to step back to any moment in the city's history in the last eight 
decades. Most of them choose to return to the era before freeways, to a time 
before some San Diegans thought of their city as a shining condominium on a 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of Saturday's ball was "The Lady Is Eighty," a graceful bow to an 
octogenarian who, on the whole, carries her age less like a matron in 
blue-rinse hair than like a doughty dowager intent on retaining her role as 
head of the family. This was the 80th anniversary of the first Charity Ball, 
but not the 80th installment, since it skipped a year during World War I and 
went on a decade-long hiatus during the Depression and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the Charity Ball are simple enough: It attracts more than 1,000 
guests to the Del's Grand Ballroom, raises considerable funds for Children's 
Hospital and Health Center and, since it focuses on dancing, is the only true 
ball in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality is that it constitutes tradition and continuity for a city that 
has seen its population multiply some 50-fold since the ball was founded in 
1909. About 700 guests, or 1.5% of the city's population, attended the 1912 
ball, and representatives of many of the same families turned out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Most have been represented steadily through the decades, and among old-line 
names on the box-holder list at "The Lady Is Eighty" were those of the Golden, 
Gildred, Jessop, Starkey, Oatman, Robinson, Carter, Frost, Giddings, Porter, 
Fenton, Sefton and Clark. The presence of Dallas Clark and his wife, Mary, 
typified the continuity symbolized by the Charity Ball, since Dallas' mother, 
then Lena Sefton Wakefield, managed the 1909 event, and, then as Mrs. Henry 
Clark, returned to chair the 1946 Charity Ball. And Mary Clark chaired the 1971 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Yvonne Larsen and co-chairwoman Karon Luce (who reversed the roles 
they played in 1979) designed a very traditional ball that took a long, fond 
glance back through its many incarnations. The La Jolla Civic/University Chorus 
offered the pre-ball entertainment with "Broadway Jazz," a medley of the Jerome 
Kern, George Gershwin and Irving Berlin songs that have been a staple at the 
Charity Ball since its early days. 
</P>
<P>
After a formal welcome by Larsen, Children's Hospital and Health Center board 
chairman Bob Adelizzi and its foundation chairman, Philip Blair, the ball 
officially opened when Larsen and her husband, Port District Commissioner Dan 
Larsen, took the first turns to "The Blue Danube." The same waltz opened Lena 
Sefton Wakefield's 1909 ball at the Robinson Hotel and has cued the feet of 
generations of Charity Ball attendees ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The Murray Korda Orchestra and the Michael Sullivan Band alternated to 
accommodate those who wished to dance non-stop, but as is usual at Charity 
Balls, the action was by no means restricted to the dance floor. A favorite 
feature is "box hopping," or gathering at the curious, wedge-shaped groupings 
of chairs that radiate from the dance floor and are populated by individuals 
and families who have maintained them for decades (the current record-holding 
individual is Mrs. John Fox, who has maintained her box since 1946). Originally 
designed to view the entertainment, the boxes are used for all sorts of 
purposes -- during World War I, matrons knitted socks and sweaters for 
doughboys while their daughters danced. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the box holders at "The Lady Is Eighty" spent part of the evening 
reading the brilliant program assembled by Joy Frye. The 257 pages gave a 
decade-by-decade history of the ball and presented many of the families who 
have had lengthy or recent involvement with the event. The program also focused 
on the beneficiary, Children's Hospital, which as a charity seems to have a 
greater facility at bringing together the Establishment and newcomers than do 
many of the city's cultural institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Larsen stressed the seminal role of the Charity Ball in San Diego fund 
raising. "Many families have two or three generations here tonight, and I think 
that many with a history of supporting San Diego charities learned to do it by 
first attending the Charity Ball," she said. "There are 80 years of 
significance behind this ball, but I feel 29 tonight -- putting together "The 
Lady Is Eighty" has been a revitalizing experience." 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi characterized the event as "one of the marvelous moments in San 
Diego." "I hope the Charity Ball will always be with us," he said. "The history 
is grand, and the cause is equally grand." 
</P>
<P>
Children's Hospital president Blair Sadler said that he admired the ball's 
combination of tradition and continuity, adding that "it is fresh every year, 
for a cause that is enduring. The Charity Ball is important not just from the 
standpoint of the dollars it raises, but because it reminds the community of 
what a unique resource CHHC is." 
</P>
<P>
But it may be that of all those who commented on the event, its true nature was 
summed up best by a guest who remarked, "This ball's a survivor. It's been 
around longer than almost anyone here, and it'll be around after all of us are 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Charity Ball drew on the services of a committee far larger than that 
assembled by any other annual event. Among those in key positions were Susan 
Hoehn, Maureen Ghio, Nan Lutes, Jill Young, Marilyn Cleator, Barbara Malone, 
Lynn Bernard, Nora Newbern, Marie Huff, Barbara Brown, Chris Andrews, Diane 
Pastore, Sue Busby, Paula Landale, Dulie Ahlering, Kathryn Murphy, Fran Golden, 
Charlene Larsen Fravel, Virginia Monday, Dorene Whitney, Nancy Hester, Anne 
Evans and Tommi Adelizzi.

MARYLOUISE OATES: THE PARTY IS OVER ... FOR A WHILE

<TEXT>
<P>
(Marylouise Oates is taking a six-month leave of absence.) 
</P>
<P>
My au revoir was planned as hip and flip; 
</P>
<P>
I'm off to write my novel (at long last). 
</P>
<P>
Black-ties and veal critiques won't be my trip; 
</P>
<P>
My book's on '60s pols -- good times long past. 
</P>
<P>
My scrapbook and my trusty Rolodex 
</P>
<P>
Can catalogue the eight years that I've spent 
</P>
<P>
On premieres, benefits, the social treks 
</P>
<P>
To parties that were bombs -- or heaven-sent. 
</P>
<P>
But what I've seen (and hope sometimes you've read) 
</P>
<P>
Is that beneath the mink and diamond glitz 
</P>
<P>
Folks here care and some of them have led 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us to work, to do our bits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
My first salute is to groups fighting AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
You've now become too numerous to name. 
</P>
<P>
But let me quick, before the memory fades, 
</P>
<P>
Cite Peter Scott who first stood without shame 
</P>
<P>
To raise cash and hope for those hit so hard. 
</P>
<P>
Kudos La Liz, Joel Weisman, Barry Krost, 
</P>
<P>
Mathilde Krim -- your work is still so marred 
</P>
<P>
By deaths -- so many gone, so many lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In this big city, some kids stand alone 
</P>
<P>
'Til helped by women who put style aside. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo Colleagues -- you've added perfect tone 
</P>
<P>
To help those kids. And right beside you stride 
</P>
<P>
United Friends of the Children. 
</P>
<P>
To you all -- To Nancy Daly, Stacey Winkler: Cheers 
</P>
<P>
For your constant presence at MacLaren Hall. 
</P>
<P>
And when singling out the special volunteers 
</P>
<P>
Begin with Music Center folks. They've heard the call. 
</P>
<P>
But with museums, groups and causes 
</P>
<P>
It's not the structure that makes L.A. care, 
</P>
<P>
But each person who joins in, who pauses 
</P>
<P>
In his own life to help others fare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In my six months away, there are things I just won't miss, 
</P>
<P>
But to certain great people, let me send you a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
Cheers to the Byrens, the Kleins and the Plitts. 
</P>
<P>
To the O'Malleys and Dodgers, a season of hits. 
</P>
<P>
To Rodeo Drive and its very special Fred Hayman 
</P>
<P>
To other friends of the homeless, a rousing amen. 
</P>
<P>
Memories crowd up. The Wrathers, Jack and dear Bunny, 
</P>
<P>
Cary Grant, who could be both sexy and funny. 
</P>
<P>
The singing debut of the Betty Clooney Foundation; 
</P>
<P>
Spago -- the night of my engagement reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the city curtsy to Fergie and Andrew 
</P>
<P>
Like it's done to the Wassermans, Edie and Lew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big givers shine on both sides of the aisle, 
</P>
<P>
Like Mrs. Margaret Brock -- politics with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
And recent arrivals like Ted Field and Susie; 
</P>
<P>
Every party at Green Acres sure has been newsy. 
</P>
<P>
Give a hand to old hands in the charity game -- 
</P>
<P>
Without SHARE and its Boomtown nothing's the same. 
</P>
<P>
While "Show Co" puts stars on the politics trail, 
</P>
<P>
Judy Levy, Charlotte Conway sell out without fail. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Pillsbury and her Richard Kletter 
</P>
<P>
Join Marilyn, Alan Bergman -- none better. 
</P>
<P>
While the left side woos the "Sandalnistas" 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans hold court here -- at least as 
</P>
<P>
Long as people want to climb 
</P>
<P>
Up where the White House air's sublime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheers to Trumps, Bistro Garden and the Bistro; 
</P>
<P>
Toasts Esther Wachtell and Carmine Marinello; 
</P>
<P>
To Barbara and Marvin Davis parties galore; 
</P>
<P>
To Aaron and Candy, a house with one floor. 
</P>
<P>
To downtown types, like Arco's Cooks, Lod and Carole; 
</P>
<P>
To Councilmen John Ferraro, Bobby Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
To Deputy Mayor Mike and Lacey Gage; 
</P>
<P>
To Ed Sanders for making Dukakis the rage; 
</P>
<P>
To great couples -- Hirsh, Stanley and Anita; 
</P>
<P>
Cheers Marco, Joan Weiss -- there's just no one neater. 
</P>
<P>
The Special Olympics and Mr. Johnson, that's Rafer; 
</P>
<P>
To DARE and the LAPD -- we all feel much safer. 
</P>
<P>
To City Atty. Jimmy and his Monica Hahn; 
</P>
<P>
To David Jones, Milo Bixby and the million-dollar lawn; 
</P>
<P>
To the best in hoteliers -- Helen Chaplin, Jacques Camus. 
</P>
<P>
To Jane and Marc Nathanson -- may you never feel blue. 
</P>
<P>
To the Mikes -- Eisner, Ovitz and Medavoy; 
</P>
<P>
To Ruth Reichl's new baby, Nick, what a joy.

</P>
<P>
Now that Jerry's back, you'll find him eating here. 
</P>
<P>
To Mickey Kantor, to Kathinka and John Tunney; 
</P>
<P>
To Comic Relief -- which made fund-raising funny; 
</P>
<P>
For the Legal Aid Foundation -- protectors of law; 
</P>
<P>
For the Normans -- Lee, Lear and of course Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
I'll miss Army Archerd -- my eyes grow misty; 
</P>
<P>
Such fun to party -- and of course, George Christy. 
</P>
<P>
To Joan and Bill Luther, to Linda Hunt -- 
</P>
<P>
Good public relations -- keep up L.A.'s front. 
</P>
<P>
To Chuck Fuentes, to Ramona Ripston, 
</P>
<P>
To Bob Burkett -- a real political piston; 
</P>
<P>
To photogs, Lee Salem and Alan Berliner; 
</P>
<P>
To John Madden, who is considerably thinner. 
</P>
<P>
To all of the Reagans' special First Friends, 
</P>
<P>
OK. Enough. This is where my space ends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some night soon -- Thursday -- just about 7, 
</P>
<P>
When the posh suit up to go hear Andre Previn, 
</P>
<P>
My black tie and glitz will remain unworn. 
</P>
<P>
And if I feel a little forlorn 
</P>
<P>
I'll just ask Bob and Mike to go out for Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
To them and to you, hugs and a squeeze.

Folk singer Judy Collins, who had big hits with her recordings of "Both Sides 
Now" and "Send In the Clowns," is looking for another hit with her new line of 
cosmetics. Called Judy Collins Harmonics, they're what the singer calls a 
"natural alternative to cosmetic surgery." She'll debut her new venture on 
Financial News Network's "Telshop" video-shopping service from February through 
April.

A Name With a Nice Ring 
</P>
<P>
We ran into jewelry designer Lee Brevard, who said he's just finished an 
assignment for Farrah Fawcett. "She wanted a cross, something designed 
especially for her. She didn't ask for anything specific, but she gave me a 
sapphire ring that she hoped I could use and another ring that she said I could 
perhaps melt down." Brevard's final design is of silver and gold with Fawcett's 
original green sapphire in the center and five star sapphires in different 
colors surrounding it. All the edges are rounded and smooth, Brevard says, and 
it's a combination of shiny and matte finishes. But Brevard's favorite jewel is 
Fawcett herself. "She's a wonderful, kind, intelligent and patient person," he 
said. And she had to be, because Brevard was so busy, he was four months late 
with her cross.

Sheena Easton is one of many who have bought "the silver Bombay," the hot new 
spec shape at L.A. Eyeworks. The shop's Lou Gaez tells us Easton was in for the 
semi-rectangular aluminum frame, and she turned it into her own signature style 
by ordering mirrored lenses. "She really has a special knack," Gaez says. 
Rocker Brad X (his last name is Xavier), ordered "Jimmy Jacks with clips," a 
round, John Lennon style of sunglasses with clip-on sunglasses attached, so he 
gets a double dose of protection. And Marlee Matlin's choice was "brown 
Priscilla frames," which Gaez says are "very classy and sophisticated."

A Dressy Showcase 
</P>
<P>
You thought Melanie Griffith looked great at the Golden Globe Awards in her 
off-the-shoulder, black chiffon dress? We did too. So we phoned around and 
found that the dress is by Giorgio Armani, that it is from the designer's 
spring-summer collection and that it was purchased by Griffith at the Armani 
shop in New York. Furthermore, an Armani representative tells us, Griffith 
chose that dress because the low neckline would be best for showing off the new 
diamond necklace she had just gotten from her past and future husband, Don 
Johnson. She also wore the necklace at the awards.

A Wonderful Model 
</P>
<P>
The recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies in New York brought out an 
impressive number of music greats, including Stevie Wonder. He attended the 
event, as an honored guest, in a Go-Silk cream silk suit and black silk 
T-shirt, all purchased at Fred Segal on Melrose just days before. Listen hears 
that bandleader Paul Shaffer, who was also at the music tributes, came back 
from New York and into Fred Segal to buy a few Go-Silk shirts for his nightly 
appearances on "Late Night With David Letterman."

Real Women Getting Ahead 
</P>
<P>
The long line of Breck Girls who, since 1946, have been the heart of the 
shampoo company's ad campaigns, has included Christie Brinkley, Jaclyn Smith, 
Cybill Shepherd, Brooke Shields, Cheryl Tiegs and Kim Basinger. But last year 
the Breck Girl became a Breck Woman, due to what a company spokeswoman calls "a 
shift in marketing." Part of that shift includes a new focus "not on fashion 
models, but on real women." So this year, candidates for the title will be 
chosen by a TV audience, not by the company executives. The candidates will all 
appear on ABC-TV's "Home Show" starting Monday. On Thursday, viewers will be 
asked to choose the winner via a special phone-in number. And next Friday, the 
winner will be announced. That's democracy in action -- except that real women 
often have to work and can't watch noontime TV.

San Diego State had little to offer Colorado State in the way of a challenging 
basketball game Thursday night, losing, 67-47, at Moby Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The best Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg could put on the floor against the Rams 
was injured Mitch McMullen (SDSU's top scorer and rebounder), limping Sam 
Johnson and the ineffective guard trio of Michael Best, Bryan Williams and Tony 
Ross. And that wasn't nearly good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"As for us, I apologize for not (having) a better effort," said Brandenburg, 
whose team is 9-10, 3-6 in the Western Athletic Conference, and losers of six 
of the past seven games. "We just didn't respond to the bell as well as we 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
"We got an old-fashioned licking; that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs managed to stay in it early. But when SDSU switched to a 2-3 zone 
defense 5 minutes into the game, CSU took off. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (12-8, 4-5 in the WAC) outscored the Aztecs, 11-3, over the next 5 
minutes to break out to a 19-9 advantage with 10:13 left in the half. Andy 
Anderson, a reserve forward, led the charge with a 3-pointer and another 
basket. Guards Joel Tribelhorn and Trent Shippen each added 3-pointers of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Although the game was only 10 minutes old, the Aztecs would never recover. 
</P>
<P>
"As banged up as we were, I thought we'd make a basketball game out of it," 
Brandenburg said. "Then we gave up some 3-pointers in the first half, and that 
seemed to spark them." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU fought back to 19-16, but then McMullen had to sit because of his strained 
left Achilles tendon. He did not return and finished with just four points, 12 
below his average. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Mitch McMullen was having a hard time going," Brandenburg said. "He 
was somewhat ineffective, so we decided to rest him." 
</P>
<P>
CSU took advantage of SDSU's loss, going on a 16-4 run to close out the half 
with a 35-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs scored six consecutive points to open the second half, but CSU 
responded with an 11-0 spurt to open a commanding, 46-26 lead with 12:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU could get no closer than 17 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to substitute more, and then our offense really broke down," 
Brandenburg said. "We had to discipline or patience. Nothing worked for us, so 
we had a long evening." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "It was just a bad game. It was a lot of different things -- one 
of those games where you can't put a finger on any one thing." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, try shooting. The Aztecs were 19 of 46 (41%) from the floor and 5 
of 13 (39%) from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
Or how about rebounding? SDSU was beaten 36-22 on the boards -- 10-4 on 
offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, turnovers. Although the Aztecs finished with just 13, Best alone 
cost SDSU seven. 
</P>
<P>
Best finished as SDSU's top scorer with 15 points, and Bell added nine. 
Williams, the point guard, had just five points and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, CSU was 10 of 16 from behind the 3-point line, Tribelhorn 
hitting five from long range. He led all scorers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Aztecs) were definitely not as aggressive on the defensive end as they 
were out there (when SDSU won, 62-57, on Jan. 5)," Tribelhorn said. "We could 
execute our offense, and it made for some easy shots." 
</P>
<P>
CSU forwards Pat Durham and Anderson added 12 points apiece. Durham also led 
all rebounders with 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs play Air Force Saturday at noon (PST) in the second leg of their 
Western WAC road swing.

Mike Krushelnyski and Mike Allison scored 80 seconds apart to pull the Kings 
into a 6-6 tie with the New Jersey Devils Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings missed a chance to win the game in overtime when they were awarded a 
penalty shot. But New Jersey goalie Sean Burke made a stick save of Luc 
Robitaille's shot with just 1:18 left. The penalty was called on New Jersey for 
displacing the net during a scramble. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski scored the seventh goal of the period with a 20-foot wrist shot at 
16:16 to tie the game. Allison had gotten his second goal of the night on a 
power play at 14:56. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils had scored three goals in just 1:28 to take a 6-4 lead. John MacLean 
got his second of the night and 31st of they year at 10:46 to pull the Devils 
into a 4-4 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Muller scored at 11:02 to give the Devils a 5-4 lead and MacLean set up 
defenseman Tom Kurvers' goal at 12:14 for the two-goal advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles had scored four straight goals, taking a 4-3 lead, when Wayne 
Gretzky and Luc Robitaille each connected for his 35th goal of the year less 
than three minutes apart in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who went from 11:40 of the first period to 11:50 of the second 
period without a shot, scored twice on power plays in less than three minutes. 
John Tonelli started the Kings' comeback with his 27th goal of the season at 
10:13 of the second period. He took a pass from Bernie Nicholls, who was behind 
the net, and fired in a 15-footer from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Duchesne, second among league defensemen in scoring, got his career-high 
40th assist. 
</P>
<P>
Allison then scored at 12:52, just eight seconds after New Jersey's Pat 
Conacher was whistled for tripping. Allison knocked a rebound of Robitaille's 
shot between Burke's legs. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kasper, recently acquired from the Boston Bruins, assisted for his first 
point as a King. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean scored his first goal of the night at 11:40 of the first period. 
MacLean's 30-foot wrist shot from the slot split the two Los Angeles' 
defensemen and beat goalie Mark Fitzpatrick. Until MacLean's goal, the Devils 
had been outshot 9-2 to open the game.

RETURN OF LOYOLA'S KIMBLE MAKES TRIP TOUGHER FOR USD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid all the numbers -- and there were many in Loyola Marymount's 181-150 
victory over U.S. International Tuesday -- the 20 points by a certain 6-foot 
5-inch West Coast Athletic Conference first-team guard may have been the most 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Bo Kimble, after missing 13 games with a knee injury, is back. And 
that means added trouble for the University of San Diego men's basketball team 
when it visits Loyola (11-7, 5-1) Saturday night after facing Pepperdine (13-8, 
5-1) in Malibu tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"(Kimble) just adds another piece to the puzzle," said Hank Egan, USD's coach. 
"It also extends their bench and gives them that much more potential." 
</P>
<P>
USD (6-12, 1-5) is coming off its first WCAC victory, 69-64 over San Francisco. 
The Toreros were led by freshmen guards Wayman Strickland (17 points) and Gylan 
Dottin (16 points, eight rebounds). Dottin leads USD in scoring with 13 points 
per game; sophomore center Dondi Bell leads USD in rebounding (6.6) and the 
WCAC in blocked shots (2.2). 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, Loyola and St. Mary's are tied for first in the WCAC, but St. 
Mary's visits Loyola Friday and Pepperdine Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forwards Dexter Howard and Tom Lewis lead Pepperdine with 17.4 and 16.6 
points per game. Loyola center Hank Gathers leads the nation in scoring average 
(33.0) and rebounds (13.3). Jeff Fryer adds 23.4 points per game and Enoch 
Simmons 23.4 to give the Lions the most potent offense in the NCAA. JIM

THOMAS' WALKING PAPERS; 
</P>
<P>
PLODDING TAFT OFFENSE FORCES TALENTED GUARD TO SLOW PACE AS SENIOR, BUT THE 
RUNNIN' REBELS OF UNLV BECKON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dedan Thomas vividly remembers the day last fall when he ceremoniously 
redecorated his bedroom. Or, more accurately, de-decorated it. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the Taft High senior's walls were papered with recruiting 
letters from dozens of Division I schools. White drywall had been transformed 
into a rainbow-colored road map to the Final Four: Arizona, DePaul, Notre Dame, 
Nevada Las Vegas, USF, UC Santa Barbara, Iowa, Arizona State, Cal and UCLA, 
among others. All had inquired about Thomas' collegiate intentions. 
</P>
<P>
This was first-class postage, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
When Thomas signed in November to play at UNLV, however, the collegiate paper 
drive ended. The Runnin' Rebels were the team, Thomas said, that would allow 
the 5-foot, 10-inch point guard to orchestrate the flow the way he had always 
dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
"They run," he explained, succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
After the ink had dried on his letter of intent, that is precisely what Thomas 
did -- scooting directly to his room. "I took it down," he said of the 
correspondence. "Since I had committed, I took it all down." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Thomas has good reason to add padding to his walls. After 
spending 2 seasons piloting one of the best fast breaks in the Valley area, 
Thomas is spending his senior season choreographing a team that often moves 
like senior citizens, despite its 15-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we don't want to run," Taft Coach Jim Woodard quipped. "We just 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' theme this season: Walk, Don't Run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different this year," Thomas said. "It's, um, well, we don't have 
the speed we had, we don't have any all-state track runners. We just work it 
into the big men, and I walk it up the court -- a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Last season's team, with Thomas leading the fast break, was capable of 
rendering the knockout punch in a matter of minutes. Taft rolled up the points 
as fast as Thomas could maneuver the ball downcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas ran the break with such efficacy that his teammates often marveled at 
his ability to find the open man. And on the dead run, the open man better have 
open eyes or he'll be nursing an open wound. 
</P>
<P>
Even speedster Quincy Watts, a Times' All-Valley forward last season and a 
three-time state sprint champion who now attends USC, sometimes found himself 
transfixed by Thomas' fast hands and court wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep my eye on him because I know if I'm open he'll get me the 
ball," Watts said before a playoff game last season. "Instead of going in there 
to rebound, I'm watching what he does with the ball. Sometimes when I'm out 
there on the wing, I find myself watching him wheeling and dealing. He's 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any player would look slow in comparison to Watts, and Thomas is a 
blur to many others. This year's Taft team, however, has redefined the word 
"sluggish." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Woodard only half-jokingly says that when Thomas starts the fast 
break, "the last three guys downcourt are wearing red shirts." Red is Taft's 
primary school color. 
</P>
<P>
To effectively run an offense at point guard, certain characteristics are 
necessary. Foremost, the player must be fearless in the face of a strange and 
swirling brew of defenses, which can entice the unwary player into turnover 
after turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Thomas' mother said that he has been running obstacle courses for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is always room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been lightning quick," Francis Thomas said. "As a kid, he was 
scary. He used to run toward an object at full speed, then at the very last 
second . . . By the time he was 7 years old he had a scar on every part of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd run all over the house. He used to frighten me sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Now, of course, Thomas chills opponents and freezes others on his way to the 
basket. Despite facing a variety of defensive coverages, Thomas continues to 
post the numbers expected of a player of his caliber. In 1987-88, on a team 
with better overall balance, depth, speed and talent, Thomas averaged 13.9 
points and 10 assists a game. Despite the team's slow-footed offense this year, 
Thomas is averaging 18.8 points, 9.1 assists and 5.3 steals as the only 
returning full-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Thomas' contributions are more than quantitative. In Taft's 45-42 loss to 
Cleveland last week, Thomas scored 8 points, but more importantly he dictated 
the pace that gave the Toreadors a realistic chance at a huge upset of the 
Cavaliers, the second-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the face of Cleveland's full-court press, Thomas established the pace 
on both ends and the Cavaliers, in fact, eventually called off the press in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the fact that he only scored eight points, he totally controlled 
the tempo of that game," Woodard said. "When you can make teams as great as 
Cleveland move away from their normal thing, that says something." 
</P>
<P>
If Thomas has a weak point in his game, it is his perimeter shooting. Once 
hesitant to shoot from outside, Thomas spent time over the summer refining his 
jump shot, searching for less rattle and more hum. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I'd just turn them down," he said. "I'd turn 15-foot jump shots 
down all the time. Now I look to shoot it. At least, most of the time I do." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has delivered from outside several times in critical situations. In a 
Northwest Valley Conference game last month at El Camino Real, Thomas picked up 
his fourth foul in the third quarter with Taft holding a 12-point lead. Ordered 
by Woodard to stay on the perimeter to avoid drawing a charging call, Thomas 
made 3 consecutive jump shots from the 17-foot range and scored 7 points in the 
final 2 minutes of the third quarter as Taft cruised to a 76-57 win. 
</P>
<P>
Yet like all assist-oriented guards -- his idol is Isiah Thomas of the Detroit 
Pistons -- Thomas sometimes prefers to pass up open shots. Woodard says that 
Thomas' altruism does not always pay, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to encourage him to take the jump shot, not to pass off if he's open," 
Woodard said. "Sometimes he'll miss one or two shots and start backing off. But 
he is capable of making them, like he did against El Camino. That was boom, 
boom, boom." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas spent many hours of his summer vacation hammering away from longe range 
in sweltering gymnasiums with senior guard Adonis Jordan of archrival 
Cleveland. Jordan, who will attend Kansas, is considered one of the best 
outside shooters in the Valley and is one of Thomas' best friends. So when 
Thomas needed a few pointers, he visits his Dr. of J, the soon-to-be Jayhawk. 
</P>
<P>
"You can teach a guy to shoot the J," Jordan said. "But some of the other 
stuff, his dribbling, his awareness, his vision on the court, you can't teach 
anyone that. He could pick up the J in one summer -- and he's already much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who moved to California from Brooklyn in 1987, said that Thomas rates 
with the best on either coast in terms of ballhandling. And when East meets 
West? Jordan readily admits that Thomas is the better ballhawk of the two. 
</P>
<P>
"He can handle it with the best of them," Jordan said. "That's the thing in New 
York, to handle the ball and run the floor. If he was in New York, he'd 
definitely hold his own. There might be a few who are about the same, but there 
wouldn't be many that were any better." 
</P>
<P>
Like Jordan, Thomas is an emigrant of sorts. Raised near Crenshaw High in Los 
Angeles, Thomas probably would have attended Crenshaw had not his mother, an 
RTD bus driver, been transferred to the Valley after Dedan's eighth-grade year. 
He initially found the San Fernando Valley to be worse than he ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like it here at all," he said. "I hated it. I thought it was real hot 
and real boring." 
</P>
<P>
To cure the relocation blues, Thomas found solace in a place most people would 
find hot and boring -- local gyms. As his reputation grew, he quickly made 
friends, including Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a lot of the local gyms and hung out mostly with my brother," Thomas 
said. "After a while, I met guys like Adonis and it wasn't as bad." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas spent his freshman season playing on the B team in anonymity. As a 
sophomore, Thomas made the varsity as a reserve guard, playing behind senior 
Jason Bromberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea how good Dedan really was," Woodard said. "Jason was starting 
basically because he was a senior." 
</P>
<P>
Bromberg, however, contracted the chicken pox in the middle of the 1986-87 
league season, and Woodard inserted Thomas into the lineup. In his first start, 
Thomas had 10 points and 12 assists against North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, of course, hopes his debut in a UNLV uniform will be as successful. Yet 
academic problems could postpone Thomas' appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has not satisfied either provision of Prop. 48, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. rule that requires high school student-athletes to score 700 or 
better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and carry a 2.0 grade-point average in a 
specified core curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who took the SAT for the third time Saturday, also will attend night 
school this semester -- he needs 2 more semesters of math to satisfy the 
curriculum requirement and must score 70 points higher on the SAT, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that if he does not meet Prop. 48 requirements, he may play at a 
junior college next season before transferring to UNLV. He said Ventura College 
heads a list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really looking down the road right now," Thomas said. "I'll just see 
what happens and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woodard: "He's a bright kid who didn't even start taking school seriously 
until a couple of years ago. He's trying to make up a lot of ground." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also said that he will stick with UNLV despite any penalties against 
Rebel Coach Jerry Tarkanian, who faces possible NCAA sanctions for past 
recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any second thoughts," Thomas said. "I just asked myself how they 
could do that to (Tarkanian) when it happened so long ago. They should have 
penalized them a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the best team on the West Coast, no doubt. It's the best place to be." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Woodard is confident he has the best playmaking guard in the 
City Section in Thomas. Woodard, who first watched City basketball as a junior 
high student in 1954, calls Thomas "the best dribbler I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
And like his personal style, Thomas has gone about his duties with only a 
modicum of flash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes the best pass isn't necessarily the most spectacular one, 
but the most logical one," Woodard said. "It may not be the behind-the-back and 
over-the-head pass, but it still gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the quintessential, under-control point guard." 
</P>
<P>
Woodard said that Thomas' worth is hardly difficult to gauge. In fact, without 
Thomas, Taft would be leagues apart from other North Valley teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not be competitive in our league," Woodard said. "We'd probably be 
able to count the wins on one hand." 
</P>
<P>
For the team's best player, Taft fans routinely put their hands together when 
Thomas makes spectacular plays or slips another double-team. Yet Thomas also 
shoulders a disproportionate share of the blame when things go wrong. For 
instance, he took some heat when he twice missed important free throws in the 
waning moments of a 67-65 loss to University in December. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that he takes pride in being confident enough in himself to shrug 
off momentary setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys, when they miss a free throw like that in a big game, their season 
might be over," he said. "They'd be all messed up. When we lost that game 
against University, I bounced back pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
As well-known as Thomas is in high school basketball circles, he isn't the top 
cat of the family. Thomas' half-brother, Bobby Irvin, is a rap music artist 
nicknamed "Bob Cat." Irvin has performed alongside pop stars such as L. L. Cool 
J. 
</P>
<P>
And like his little brother, Bobby is in a transition phase. Irvin is now a 
record producer and solo artist and has an album due out soon on Arista 
Records, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing real, real well," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
For both Thomas and his brother, despite the changes, the beat goes on. 
Up-tempo or not.

LIONS' GUARD FLANAGAN KEEPS ORDER IN THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever the Loyola Marymount women's basketball team needs, Lynn Flanagan 
provides. The stocky 5-8 off-guard is the stable base of Loyola's most 
successful women's basketball squad. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lions require a passer who can also play defense, they turn to the 
sophomore guard. When they need a ball handler who can drive the lane to the 
hoop, they also look to her. And when they want points, they know Flanagan can 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old, who is known for consistency, physical strength and aggressive 
play, is currently in her scoring mode. 
</P>
<P>
She leads the Lions, who are in a three-way tie for first place in the West 
Coast Athletic Conference, in scoring with an 11.6 average. She's led in 
scoring in seven of 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynn is real steady," said fourth-year Coach Todd Corman. "She does the same 
things every night. We rarely have a bad night with her. She's a very intense 
player and an excellent scorer." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's partner in the back court, point guard Kristen Bruich, says she's a 
well-rounded and multitalented player who motivates the team and can do 
whatever she's asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have her at off-guard than anyone else in the league," Bruich said. 
"She's good, game in and game out. When I give her the ball, I know she's going 
to make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
The added stability has been a great part of Loyola's success. The Lions are 
13-7 (5-1 in the WCAC) after sweeping a two-game series against cross-town 
rival Pepperdine last week. Loyola has almost matched last year's victory total 
and there are eight games left in the regular season. Last year, the Lions 
finished with their best overall record (15-15) but were sixth in the 
eight-member WCAC (5-9). 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to experience, better player-coach communication and outstanding 
performances such as Flanagan's, the Lions have a five-game winning streak 
going into tonight's game at St. Mary's. The Gaels, along with Loyola and 
Gonzaga, are tied for first place in the WCAC. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this team this year," Flanagan said. "I think we've jelled. It really 
is exciting to win after being so down. We knew we should have done better 
(last year). Todd made us feel proud, but deep down inside we knew we could 
have done more." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't, however, much more for Flanagan to do as a freshman. She started 
in every game and added immediate spark to struggling Loyola as the team's 
second-leading scorer (10.2 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
She earned a reputation for aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'So what? I'm not gonna be pushed around just cause I'm a freshman.' I 
think I got a big, bad reputation last year because of that. The coaches in the 
league said I was mean and too aggressive. I've always been that way, though." 
</P>
<P>
Corman says Flanagan is just doing her job. He says she uses her physical 
strength and intensity wisely. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynn epitomizes what our team is about," he said. "We're extremely physical 
and tough, and we're not backing down from anybody. That's what she stands for. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the enforcer. There's no question about it. If there's an altercation on 
the court, Lynn will be the first one out there to defend herself and her 
teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan has always believed in doing that. At Louisville High in Woodland 
Hills, she was a three-time Assigner League selection and an All-CIF player as 
a senior with a 16-point average. Her team went to the playoffs every year. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola forward Regan O'Hara, who played with Flanagan for one year in high 
school, says Flanagan was a tough little player at Louisville who ran over 
anyone who dared to get in her way. She says Flanagan was always more muscular 
than her counterparts, which is owed, in part, to her childhood days as a 
gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan was involved with gymnastics for six years and went to the state 
finals in Class III twice. Her specialty was the vault. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always a very physical player," O'Hara said. "She's just so much 
stronger than anyone else. We could always count on her then and we can always 
count on her now. With Lynn, it's like a guarantee that things will go right." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara's brother Brian, who coaches the girls basketball team at Louisville, 
says Flanagan is the hardest working player he's ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had a million Lynns," he said. "She worked her butt off and she 
became a fantastic player. She was our stud defensive player. Now other teams 
get mad at her because they think she plays too hard, but she just plays the 
game the way it should be played. She does great things out there." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan could have played at Arizona or North Carolina but chose Loyola 
because she wanted to play in every game, she said. She didn't want to waste 
her overwhelming energy on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I can take losing better than sitting," she said. "I'd rather be here playing 
than on the bench at Texas. Besides, it was a challenge coming here because 
it's like, 'We're going to turn this program around.' " 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan and the Lions seem to be on their way.

<P>
CLEVELAND TO RETIRE JERSEY OF UCLA'S TREVOR WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He seems a little young for a retirement bash, but Cleveland High nonetheless 
will retire the jersey of 1986 graduate Trevor Wilson before today's 7 p.m. 
North Valley League game against Granada Hills at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a junior starting forward at UCLA, joins Kevin Holmes (DePaul) and 
Keith Morrison (Washington State) as the only Cleveland basketball players to 
be so honored. Morrison and Holmes play professionally abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson will be honored in a pregame ceremony by Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell. 
UCLA assistant Brad Holland, a Crescenta Valley High graduate, also may 
participate in the presentation, Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to talk a little about his accomplishments at Cleveland and UCLA," 
Braswell said. "He deserves it. He may very well be the first player from 
Cleveland to play in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson wore uniform No. 4 at Cleveland, the same number he wears at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Taking wing: Two seconds to play. Down by a basket. Inbounds pass . . . 
</P>
<P>
Give the ball to Larry Bird, right? 
</P>
<P>
Holy parquet floor! The pass is to . . . Darren Oldenberg? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the pressure," said Oldenberg, a senior guard for Canyon. "Some people 
don't like to be in that position. I like it. It's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the situation paid off in clovers for Oldenberg, a Boston Celtics 
fanatic dubbed "Bird" by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing Quartz Hill, 73-71, with 2 ticks left on the clock, 
Oldenberg found himself with the ball and both feet behind the 3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to go to Jamil Austin," Oldenberg said. "But the pass came to 
me. I shot it and it went in. All net." 
</P>
<P>
Oldenberg's 3-point basket gave Canyon a 74-73 victory. The shot heard 'round 
the campus made Olden-Bird a school celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good," said Oldenberg, who donned his green Celtic jacket immediately 
after the game. "It's something Bird does all the time." 
</P>
<P>
First and last: The Del Rey League will unveil its first postseason tournament 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the word "tournament" is too strong. The 5-team league will stage 3 
games next week to determine its 3 representatives in the Southern Section 
playoffs. On Monday, the fifth-place team (Alemany) will play the fourth-place 
team (probably St. John Bosco), and the winner will advance to a Wednesday game 
against the third-place team (probably St. Francis). The winner of that game 
becomes the league's third-place playoff representative. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Crespi, which clinched second place with Tuesday's win over St. 
Francis, will play league champion Loyola for the league's first-place playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the tournament provides a no-lose situation for Crespi, Coach Paul 
Muff has no enthusiasm for the postseason format. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never in favor of it even though we may benefit most this year," he 
said. "I don't think one game should determine No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
We wanted to add a little something to the season because we play only eight 
games in league, but I think we'll only do it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Record run: Westlake center Kurt Schwan is on the verge of 3 school records, 2 
of which likely will fall by the time the 6-8 senior leaves the floor after 
tonight's Marmonte League game against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Schwan, who will attend Weber State, has 234 rebounds this season, 2 shy of 
Derrick Beale's single-season record set in 1978-79. Schwan, who has scored 440 
points this season and 764 in his career, is 10 away from Paul Keenan's season 
mark and 70 from Keenan's career record. Keenan played from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake has 3 league games remaining and is in good position to make the 
playoffs. Schwan, however, hardly seems to be caught up in the record-setting. 
He said he set no such goals before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just to go in and play the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waves get their man: Chatsworth senior Derek Wallace, who will pitch and play 
first base for the Chancellors, has verbally committed to Pepperdine, which 
recruited him as a pitcher. High school baseball players can sign national 
letters of intent April 13. 
</P>
<P>
As the best relief pitcher in the Valley area last year, Wallace posted a 7-0 
record with 8 saves and a 3.17 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Job update: St. Genevieve Principal Rudy Trujillo has released the names of 3 
candidates for the school's vacant football job. Being considered for the post 
are Jeff Kearin, a Loyola High assistant; Mark Lovett, a Cal State Northridge 
assistant; and Ralph Rosas, an assistant at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Former Coach Kevin Kane resigned at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs down: Chaminade senior Nick Siciliano, whose left thumb was broken 
during a Jan. 20 game against Notre Dame, probably is lost for the season, 
according to Coach Mike Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically," Lynn said, "it was the best game of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Siciliano, who had never scored in double figures, finished with 12 points and 
10 rebounds. He believed his thumb was broken early in the second half but 
didn't want to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
Add Chaminade: When in doubt, call on Ted Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran might become Chaminade's first freshman 3-sport varsity athlete. Last 
fall, Corcoran joined the varsity football team at midseason. This week, he 
replaced Siciliano on the basketball team. In the spring, Corcoran will take a 
shot at varsity baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He might be remembered as one of the best athletes to come out of Chaminade," 
Lynn said. "Basketball is his worst sport." 
</P>
<P>
Booted: The Reseda boys' soccer team, last year's City Section champion with a 
13-4-2 record, will not qualify for the playoffs this season. The Regents are 
0-4-2 in the Valley Pac 8 Conference and 4-5-3 overall. 
</P>

TUESDAY TARGETED AS DAY OF DECISION FOR CRESPI'S WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell White of Crespi High, the state's all-time leading rusher and scorer, 
said that he will announce his college choice Tuesday at the Encino school. 
</P>
<P>
White has whittled his list of college preferences to Cal, USC and Washington. 
He took the last of his 3 trips last weekend to Washington. He said that the 
field remains wide open and that he has yet to decide. The first day high 
school seniors can sign national letters of intent is Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In his 3-year varsity football career at Crespi, White set state records for 
rushing (5,998), touchdowns (94) and points (568).

PRECOCIOUS FRESHMEN BASKETBALL-WISE BEYOND THEIR YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian High guard Tiffany Stutz recorded a triple-double last Friday in a 
girls' basketball game against San Diego: 20 points, a school-record 17 steals 
and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The same day in a boys' game against Lincoln, Hoover's Alex Davis scored 25 
points and had 10 rebounds and 5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
While the numbers are hardly astonishing for high school varsity basketball, 
consider: 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Stutz is 14 years old, Alex Davis 15. 
</P>
<P>
Both are freshmen, and they are making more than just token contributions to 
their teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
Stutz leads Christian in scoring with a 16.2 average, second in the City 
Central League. Davis is Hoover's second-leading scorer with an 11.2 average. 
</P>
<P>
They are not alone. Both have freshman teammates -- Trisha Montgomery at 
Christian at Tony Maxwell at Hoover -- averaging 8 points a game. Chris Miller, 
Fallbrook's leading scorer at 10 points per game, is the only other freshman 
boy playing varsity in San Diego County. But the girls' game has 13 others. 
</P>
<P>
In the Avocado League, El Camino's Heather Bassett averages 10 points and 9 
rebounds, and Valerie Ryan scores five a game for San Pasqual. Jennifer Yerkey 
(Granite Hills) and Heather Holm (El Cajon Valley) play in the Grossmont 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Conference has five ninth-grade girls: Autumn Bailey (Castle Park), 
Jennifer Benitez (Chula Vista), Tameeka Hall (Southwest), Jennifer Reyes 
(Marian) and Adanya Guevara (Marian). Kamilah Gipson (Morse) and Audrey Cooper 
(Serra) represent the City Eastern League, Allison Brady (Poway) the Palomar 
and Marguerite Trevino (Our Lady of Peace) the City Central. 
</P>
<P>
While Stutz and Davis have the most impressive statistics, all are playing 
significant roles on their teams. Freshman not doing so, most coaches feel, 
would be better off with the junior varsity or freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
Stutz's production was counted on long before the season began. "I used to 
watch her, as an eighth grader, play and score 40 points a game in 3 quarters," 
said Rod Bell, Christian's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago in a game against Crawford, Stutz had 28 points, 11 steals and 8 
assists. She was on her way to equaling her season-high of 30 points and 
possibly a triple-double when she was fouled from behind on a break-away. 
</P>
<P>
Stutz had to be carried off the court and taken to the hospital, where doctors 
diagnosed her as having a severe contusion on her left kneecap. She missed the 
next two games but returned in triple-double fashion against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a freshman, I didn't really think I would be on varsity," Stutz said. 
"I'm surprised with all that's happening." 
</P>

She shouldn't have been. Stutz was an outside hitter on Christian's City 
Central champion volleyball team. She also plays softball, runs the mile and 
2-mile in track and has won numerous junior tennis tournaments around the 
county. In her first semester at Christian, she earned a 3.5 
grade-point-average after finishing Christ Lutheran grade school with a 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit, sports are a really big part of my life," Stutz said. "But so 
are my religion and my friends. I don't want people to know me because I play 
sports. I want them to know me for who I am. I'm a pretty sociable person. I 
like going out to the movies or going shopping. I love going shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Stutz, 5-feet 6-inches, with long blonde hair, braces on her teeth and an 
ever-present adolescent bounce in her step and speech, looks her age and admits 
she acts like a typical freshman. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Davis, who is 6-2 and 200 pounds, is a muscular man-child. Hoover 
Coach Hal Mitrovich likes to compare him to Davis' uncle, Andre Hardy, a former 
Hoover star and NFL running back with the Philadelphia Eagles, Seattle Seahawks 
and San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys on the team always tell me I look 30 years old," Davis said, "and 
that I should be collecting a pension check." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich says Davis not only looks older than he is but also acts in a mature 
fashion for a 15-year-old. Mitrovich said he named Davis co-captain for the 
Lincoln game and had Davis give a talk to the other players about how to 
prepare for a game. 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich said, "I thought to myself, 'Should I do this? Maybe that's putting 
too much pressure on him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Davis responded with his biggest game of the year, in a 119-74 loss. "Davis led 
the way," Mitrovich said. "He was the one we wanted to get the ball to. And he 
wanted the ball. Maybe, if we had a really experienced, really talented team, 
he might be a sixth man. He's legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Like Stutz, Davis is not one-dimensional. He also plays baseball and this fall 
split time with varsity and junior varsity football as a running back, 
linebacker and kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"My uncle would make me play with the older guys," Davis said. "He could see it 
in me that I could play sports. I owe a lot to him, Coach Mitrovich and Dave 
Mitrovich (Hal's son, a Hoover assistant coach)." 
</P>
<P>
Davis adds, "I was surprised with the fact that I could play varsity here. But 
if you put your mind to it, you can do anything."

DOMINANT ENGER TIPS SCALE AS VISTA ROUTS POWAY IN PALOMAR SHOWDOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Trousdale, Poway High's girls' basketball coach, likes to describe his team 
as balanced. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, that balance can be thrown out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
Take Thursday night's Palomar League game at Vista. Vista has Chris Enger, a 
6-foot 4-inch center. And Poway, with no player over 6-feet, couldn't match up. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an unbalanced game for the league lead, one in which Vista 
dominated inside, took an early lead and cruised to a 70-40 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between these two teams is Chris Enger's height and talent," 
Trousdale said. "That's what threw this game out of balance." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Poway (15-8, 7-2) tilted early. The Titans were down, 20-10, after 
the first quarter and 32-17 midway through the second after Enger scored on 
back-to-back rebound baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Enger finished with 28 points and kept Poway at bay with her rebounding and 
defense. Poway center Laura Nugent found the going especially difficult inside 
-- Enger blocked 4 of her 5 first-half shot attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so tall that we have to alter our game," Trousdale said. "We just 
couldn't get anything inside." 
</P>
<P>
Poway couldn't get much outside, either, though guard Chisty Fortney did manage 
13 points. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Vista (19-3, 8-1) isn't a solo show. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Dana Christofferson had 17 points, and senior guard Kelly Schott 
had 13. Both played things tight on the defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody thinks this is a one-player team, they're not looking very hard," 
Enger said. "We have experience, and we have girls who can play. I don't just 
bring it up court and shoot the ball myself." 
</P>
<P>
But you get the idea she could. Several times Thursday, Enger dribbled up court 
to break Poway's press. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't handle Point Loma's press earlier this season (in a loss to the 
top-ranked Pointers), so we've been working on it," Enger said. "If we can keep 
this up, maybe it will pay off for us later." 
</P>
<P>
Later means down the road in the San Diego Section Division II playoffs, which 
Vista figures to win because Point Loma will be playing in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can go all the way," said Enger, whose team has lost in the 
semifinals and the finals the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona 38, Carlsbad 34 -- Gina Tamburrino and Kris Miller led host Ramona 
(14-3, 8-2) with 12 apiece; Kendra Brunge added 10. Ramona led, 26-16, at 
halftime but was slowed in the second half by injuries and fouls. Brunge picked 
up her fourth foul early in the third quarter, and two Ramona players were 
injured and did not return. Heidi Richner led Carlsbad with 15. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 54, El Camino 31 -- Susie O'Brien scored a game-high 32 points for 
San Marcos (14-5, 9-0), and Shantel Paopao added 15. Heather Bassett led El 
Camino (3-15, 2-8) with 12 points, and Shannon Downey added 10.

Sweetwater 84, Bonita Vista 57 -- Carlos Campbell scored a game-high 21 points, 
and Cortez Rice added 17 for host Sweetwater. Sweetwater (21-2, 10-1) led by 
six at halftime and took control with a strong running game in the third 
quarter. CHRIS ELLO

NEW ARMS FOR NICARAGUA

<TEXT>

Nicaragua is believed to have received six North Korean-made torpedo boats in a 
large consignment of weapons on a Soviet freighter, Jane's Defense Weekly 
reported in its latest issue. The shipment is thought to include mortars, 
anti-tank weapon launchers, air-to-ground rockets, anti-personnel mines, 
ammunition and vehicle spares, said Jane's, a respected journal of military 
affairs. The consignment was brought by the freighter Junda in the last weeks 
of 1988 and unloaded at the Atlantic port of Rama, according to the journal. 
Jane's said the six fast-attack craft will make Nicaragua's navy the most 
powerful in Central America.

The Senate Rules Committee rebuffed federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings' request 
that the full Senate conduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial. 
Instead, the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers to conduct hearings 
that would be televised so senators could watch if they chose. "There will be 
no question about the fairness of it," Rules Committee Chairman Wendell H. Ford 
(D-Ky.) said as his panel approved a plan under which six Republicans and six 
Democrats would be named to hear evidence. The House already approved a bill of 
impeachment alleging that the U.S. District Court judge conspired with a 
Washington attorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchange 
for a guarantee they would not serve time.

Selection of a jury pool for Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial reached the 
halfway point, with the judge predicting the effort will take most of next week 
also. By the end of the third day of selecting a pool of 50 potential jurors, 
18 women and seven men had been qualified after painstaking, often solicitous 
questioning. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell also declared heatedly he 
won't allow "security gurus" to interrupt the trial, after prosecutor John 
Keker asked him whether four courtroom seats could be made available on a 
rotating basis to the CIA, the Justice, Defense and State departments and the 
National Security Agency. Gesell reacted angrily, saying: "I'm very concerned 
about their function. I do not intend to have this case run by two or three 
security gurus sitting in the audience. I don't want to be in a position where 
every time a document flashes by you go to these people, who check with their 
department."

Rioters threw rocks and bottles and set trash bins on fire in Tampa, Fla., in 
the second night of violence after a suspected drug dealer died in police 
custody. Police cordoned off the same predominantly black neighborhood where 
about 100 officers in riot gear quelled the first outbreak Wednesday night by 
about 75 people. That melee erupted following the arrest of Edgar Allen Price, 
40, in an undercover operation. In an effort to prevent further trouble in the 
College Hill section, authorities released details of the arrest, saying Rice 
died of cardiac arrest after struggling to fight off six police officers. Price 
had not been beaten or choked, Deputy Chief Thomas DePolis said. He said an 
officer was hurt in the melee when she was hit by a rock, although he didn't 
know the extent of the injuries.

A freighter arrived in Inchon, South Korea, with coal from North Korea, the 
first direct merchandise shipment from the north to south since the Korean War. 
Previous shipments from the north have gone though third countries. The direct 
shipment came a day after Chung Ju Young, honorary chairman of South Korea's 
giant Hyundai industrial group, confirmed that he has agreed in principle to 
help build a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad plant in the north. Chung, 
returning from a 10-day visit to the north, said the projects are subject to 
approval by both governments.

POLICE UNION SUES SAN JOSE

<TEXT>

The San Jose police officers' union has filed suit against the city, charging 
that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of a police officer 
by a crazed gunman last month. "The situation probably would have been resolved 
if there had been two officers there," said Carm Grande, president of San Jose 
Police Officers' Assn. Officer Gene Simpson, 45, was killed Jan. 20 after he 
responded alone to a call that led to a confrontation with a mentally unstable 
suspect outside a downtown doughnut shop. After overpowering Simpson, the 
suspect used the officer's .357 Magnum service revolver to shoot him in the 
head.

An Israeli government worker accused of trying to sell secrets to the PLO was 
brought home from Greece by Israeli officials overnight and arrested when he 
landed at Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel Radio reported. The 35-year-old defendant 
appeared in court and was remanded in custody for 10 days, with publication of 
his name forbidden, the government radio said. According to the broadcast, the 
man surrendered to Israeli officials in Athens after the Palestine Liberation 
Organization failed to pay him the $1.5 million he sought for his information. 
The man, who immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1970s and worked at an 
Israeli government agency, reportedly told authorities that he was having 
financial problems and tried to sell the PLO information.

The trial in Sunnyvale of seven anti-abortion protesters began with the 
prosecutor telling jurors that abortion is not the issue in the case. "It's 
about trespass," Rebecca Hayworth of the Santa Clara County district attorney's 
office said in her opening arguments. The defendants, all members of the 
Operation Rescue anti-abortion group, were among about 250 people arrested Oct. 
29 at the Family Planning Alternatives Inc. clinic in Sunnyvale.

DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD AWAKENING TO BIG PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A century ago, the city's first oil strike transformed the low hills just west 
of downtown Los Angeles into a makeshift boom town. The landscape bristled with 
500 oil derricks. Shanties sprang up near mansions. Now, the downtown's 
westward expansion into that historic neighborhood is once again stirring the 
expectations of rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Central City West, a strand of 355 acres running from the Hollywood 
Freeway south to Olympic Boulevard, west of the Harbor Freeway, is becoming a 
magnet for downtown real estate developers looking for cheaper land and a freer 
hand to build what they want. At the same time, the Los Angeles city 
councilwoman who represents most of the area, Gloria Molina, wants to make it a 
haven for poor and elderly people who so often lose their homes when old 
neighborhoods become the targets of new development. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avoid a collision of interests, Molina and the developers have formed 
an uneasy partnership. The developers are tentatively agreeing to foot most of 
the bill for the low-income housing Molina wants. In return, they hope to get 
out from under some of the control that government has exercised over the size 
and shapes of their buildings in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The new partnership is an interesting match-up. It unites Molina, who grew up 
in an Eastside barrio, with a cohort of the city's most politically astute 
capitalists. If Molina gets all the low-income housing she wants, the deal 
could trigger the highest development fees in the country. If Molina offers the 
developers the breaks they want, she could find herself in a fight with 
powerful downtown interests who see themselves in competition with Central City 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Molina can fashion a broadly acceptable deal, there is no guarantee 
that the new housing will be cheap enough to accommodate all of the renters who 
live in the area now. 
</P>
<P>
A patchwork landscape, Central City West stretches from the bustle of Wilshire 
and Olympic boulevards to the barrios and vacant lots of Temple-Beaudry and 
Crown Hill. Good Samaritan Hospital, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and 
the Pacific Stock Exchange are all part of this neighborhood where, on side 
streets, you can hear roosters in the morning and smell the crude oil that is 
still being pumped from back-yard wells. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 16,000 to 17,000 people who live there are Latino families renting 
from absentee landlords and earning less than half of the county's median 
annual family income of $28,000. Many of the inhabitants are new arrivals from 
Central America. Others settled in the area after being displaced by urban 
renewal projects elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Elusive Goal 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment of the area could also achieve one of the city's more elusive 
goals, blending past and present styles to create a flourishing residential 
neighborhood close to downtown. Rich and poor, immigrants and natives would 
live near each other. People could walk to work. Architectural landmarks would 
be preserved. Spruced-up Victorian cottages would command views of new 
skyscrapers designed by such internationally acclaimed architects as Kenzo 
Tange and Helmut Jahn. 
</P>
<P>
Central City West may be a long way from reality, but it is more than an 
expensive fantasy. Land has been bought and cleared, architects and lobbyists 
hired, community meetings held in schools and living rooms, and political 
muscles flexed as developers and public officials jockey for control. 
</P>
<P>
"The only things that can do this project in is fear and greed," joked George 
Mihlsten, a lawyer and leading City Hall lobbyist who represents a consortium 
of Japanese and American developers who want to put up a hotel-office complex 
on several acres of land bordering the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The project has attracted a host of major developers, among them Ray Watt, 
Unocal Corp., Tutor Saliba Properties and Shimizu America Corp. Working 
alongside them is a cadre of well-connected lobbyists, including Mihlsten, 
former City Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, former City Atty. Burt Pines, and 
former city Planning Commission Chairman Dan Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surge in Population 
</P>
<P>
If the dreams for Central City West come true, the population could rise as 
high as 40,000. Eight thousand to 10,000 housing units would be built. Ten 
million to 20 million square feet of office buildings would go up, expanding 
the downtown area's high-rise office market by at least 25%. Along Glendale 
Boulevard and elsewhere, rows of new retail services would take root. 
</P>
<P>
To make it all come together, the Central City West partnership will also have 
to build new roads. Now, there are no through streets running north and south. 
Land also would have to be set aside for new parks and schools. With public 
funds scarce, Molina will have to look to the private sector to finance a large 
part of those improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In their public statements, members of the Central City West partnership are 
bubbling with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
At one meeting recently, lobbyist Mihlsten put his arm around Susan Cloke, a 
former Santa Monica city planning official who now works for Molina. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at me, a rock-ribbed Republican working side by side with a former chief 
planner for the People's Republic of Santa Monica," Mihlsten said. 
</P>
<P>
Just beneath the surface, however, Central City West is alive with tension. 
Developers, who have interest payments to meet and investors to satisfy, want 
to start building now before a housing plan for the area has been adopted. 
Meanwhile, many of the area's remaining residents want assurances that they 
won't lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she does not want to approve a single commercial development until 
all of the developers have agreed on a housing plan that specifies the number 
of low-income apartments to be built, their location and method of financing. 
Molina's goal is to replace the 2,000 low-income units that have been torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the housing. I want a stable community there. My goal is to see to it 
that the area doesn't become another Bunker Hill or Chavez Ravine," Molina said 
recently, referring to the displacement of thousands of poor families by the 
redevelopment of Bunker Hill and the construction of Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
No one is saying no to Molina, although she worries that some people who are 
saying yes mean something else. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, the former councilman who is representing Ray Watt, said he has offered 
Molina "a blank check" for housing, a promise to pay whatever the other 
developers ultimately agree to, if the city will hurry up and approve Watt's 
planned 1.6-million-square-foot office project. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Snyder said, he is confident that Molina's colleagues on the 
City Council will not ask developers to pay for the 2,000 low-income units 
Molina wants. The council, he said, does not want to risk alienating the only 
source of capital for housing in Central City West. 
</P>

"We feel it is possible to nurture the goose and have it lay nice gold eggs 
over time. We have a certain faith that the city is not going to kill the 
goose," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
While developers and city officials debate the cost of replacement housing, 
many people who still live in the area worry about losing what they have. For 
five years, they have witnessed the ravages of real estate speculation as 
bulldozers plowed homes and yards into a rubble-strewn desert surrounded by 
chain-link fences. The notion that new apartment buildings are destined to be 
built there is slim consolation to longtime neighbors such as Gloria Esquivel 
and Misael Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to go into a chicken coop. There would be no room for my dogs, no 
place for my garden," said Esquivel, who said she pays $200 a month for a 
rambling four-bedroom house in the Temple-Beaudry neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A recent community meeting on Temple-Beaudry Hill underscored the confusion and 
apprehension surrounding the future of the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Study in Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
Held in a school auditorium, the meeting was a study in contrasts. A knot of 
developers, dressed in aviator jackets, fleece-lined denim vests and cowboy 
boots, congregated in the back of a room while the residents, many of them 
elderly men in coats and ties, struggled in broken English to learn the fate of 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Molina presided, assuring people that there would be no wholesale evictions, 
that the city would not use its powers of eminent domain to acquire property. 
</P>
<P>
While she spoke, developer Leonard Glickman quietly promoted a totally 
different plan in the back of the room. Glickman proposes to clear 50 acres, 
relying on local government to take property where necessary, and build a 
junior high school and several square blocks of new apartments in place of the 
homes that are there now. 
</P>
<P>
"People would have replacement housing built and waiting for them before they 
had to move," Glickman said, adding: "Under a plan like ours, eminent domain 
isn't necessarily a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Glickman's proposal is on hold. But even if it never comes 
to pass, Molina may not be able to ensure that the neighborhood can be 
preserved or that all of the tenants will be able to afford the replacement 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the houses that are left are owned by absentee landlords, free to 
sell whenever they are offered an attractive price. More than half of the 
renters earn $10,000 or less a year. Even the cheapest replacement housing may 
be out of the range of some tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs of Tenants 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can do a hell of a job with housing, but we won't be able to take 
care of everybody's needs. I don't think we can promise everyone over there 
dollar-for-dollar replacement for what they've been paying," said Dan Garcia, a 
lawyer representing Hillman Properties, one of the largest developers in 
Central City West.

JAPAN SEEKS NEW WORLD INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TELLS U.S. IT WANTS GREATER SAY IN GLOBAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS, ECONOMY

<P>
Japan served notice Thursday that it wants to play a new, broader role in 
international affairs and management of the world economy, a consequence of its 
growing economic strength and increasing status as a global power. 
</P>
<P>
The message, delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a meeting 
with President Bush, is that Japan wants more say as the Bush Administration 
develops its policies toward the Soviet Union, aid to Latin America and the 
economic integration of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the Japanese approach, reinforced more bluntly in a series of 
briefings for reporters by senior Japanese officials, was decidedly assertive, 
with clear signs that Tokyo expects to become a far more equal partner on 
global issues than it has been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Forceful Than Expected 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration strategists conceded that they were somewhat surprised by 
the intensity of the message. Tokyo had provided some advance notice of what 
Takeshita would say but the tone of the Japanese demands was more forceful than 
some had expected. 
</P>
<P>
"They see an Administration that is reviewing its policies . . . across the 
board. They see Europe moving toward integration. They are saying they want to 
be dealt in -- they want to be consulted," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2 1/2-hour session, which marked Bush's first meeting as President with 
any foreign leader, Takeshita declared repeatedly that the United States and 
Japan should cooperate on more equal footing on "joint endeavors in order to 
create a better world." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Takeshita told Bush that Japan wants the United States to 
consult far more closely with Tokyo as the United States and the Soviet Union 
move forward in their efforts to improve their relations. At the moment, Japan 
appears to be much more skeptical of the degree of change in the Soviet Union 
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev than is the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Japanese issued a sterner-than-usual demand that the 
United States reduce its federal budget deficit, which many analysts believe is 
straining the world economy. Tokyo is said to be growing increasingly impatient 
with progress on that front. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said there also are indications that Japan is prepared to begin 
picking up substantially more of the price tag for economic and political aid 
around the world -- including such areas as the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and other officials appeared prepared to encourage Japan to take on a 
wider role -- within limits. The President acknowledged after the meeting that 
Washington agrees with "the importance of frequent consultations at all levels 
on international issues." 
</P>
<P>
And aides quoted the President as assuring Takeshita that the United States is 
"not pulling back" from its security obligations in Asia, such as maintaining 
the U.S. military presence in South Korea and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months of Hints on Role 
</P>
<P>
The new, more assertive Japanese posture follows 18 months of hints that the 
Japanese want to take on a political role in global affairs that is more 
commensurate with their economic power -- a push that Takeshita as prime 
minister has made a personal quest. 
</P>
<P>
At a conference of Southeast Asian nations in December, 1987, Takeshita 
suggested that Japan plans to help guide the economic development of the rest 
of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
And at last summer's seven-nation economic summit, the Japanese produced their 
own proposal for resolving the Third World debt problem, challenging the plan 
the United States had offered two years previously. Before that, Tokyo had been 
passive, content merely to follow the U.S. lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the push for more clout abroad also is being viewed as an effort by 
Takeshita to bolster his growing political weakness at home in the face of his 
administration's recent stock market scandal and dissatisfaction over its tax 
reform initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun, a Tokyo newspaper, reported Thursday that popular support 
for Takeshita's government had plummeted to a low of 27.4% -- an unusually poor 
showing. Some fear that the prime minister's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is 
beginning to lose its grip. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita is to fly to California tonight and is scheduled to pay a farewell 
visit Monday to former President Ronald Reagan before returning home. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's early visit here, partly designed to overcome his increasing 
unpopularity at home, was supposed to have taken place Jan. 6 but was postponed 
because of the then-growing prospect that Emperor Hirohito might die. Hirohito 
died Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore the importance that the United States places on its relationship 
with Japan, Bush has announced that he will travel to Tokyo later this month 
for Hirohito's state funeral, a gesture that was actively sought by the 
Japanese. Bush also plans to stop in China and South Korea on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
For all his demands for a wider role, Takeshita took pains to assure Bush that 
Tokyo is not about to challenge U.S. leadership in global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no country that can replace the U.S. in the Free World," he said. "We 
want the United States to be strong." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan hopes to be America's "most reliable" partner in world 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has been moving steadily in recent months to step up its influence in 
world affairs. Earlier this month, Tokyo announced that, partly because of U.S. 
insistence, it again will increase its defense budget so that it can pay more 
of the costs of Washington's international peacekeeping burden. 
</P>
<P>
And just last week, the Japanese unveiled plans to expand their foreign aid, 
enough to make Japan the world's largest provider of economic aid to developing 
countries by fiscal 1990, which begins April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also has taken major steps to stimulate demand at home and to open its 
markets to more imports, including manufactured goods from the United States. 
And it has helped the United States and West Germany to keep the value of the 
dollar low enough so the U.S. trade deficit can be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bush publicly acknowledged Japan's efforts in all three areas, and 
pledged that the United States will push to reduce its budget deficit in the 
coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama is expected to press the United 
States on the budget issue at a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of 
Seven industrial countries here today. Besides the United States and Japan, the 
other seven nations are West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of Peacekeeping Forces 
</P>
<P>
Another role Japan has discussed is to help finance international peacekeeping 
forces -- not only within Asia but elsewhere. Tokyo has begun to support the 
multinational forces in the Sinai Peninsula and has offered to fund a 
peacekeeping unit in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
But the global scope that Japan sketched out Thursday extends far beyond the 
confines of Asia or international peacekeeping forces. The Japanese also listed 
trade, global debt, the environment and science and technology as issues in 
which they want to become involved.

BILLIONS IN U.S. HOLDINGS GIVE TOKYO BIG LEVER 
</P>

Japan, which holds at least $60 billion worth of U.S. government securities and 
billions more in American corporate stocks and bonds, has the economic leverage 
to back up Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's intention to obtain for his 
government a share of the United States' global leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Japan has become a major lender in the United States, helping 
to finance the huge budget deficits of the Reagan Administration and buying up 
important blocks of American real estate and corporate securities. As a result, 
Japanese investment decisions could have a major impact on the American 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Japan has not used its economic power to force changes in American 
diplomatic and political policy, and there are some very good reasons why it 
would be reluctant to go that far. But Takeshita made it clear in his Thursday 
meeting with President Bush that Tokyo expects to be consulted before 
Washington takes action on a wide range of global issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been rumors for the past several years that the Japanese are ready 
to manipulate the U.S. Treasury bond market to affect policies that are 
important to them," said Edward J. Lincoln, an Asia expert at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington. "The evidence of them having done this is very 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Japan clearly is ready to cast aside the reticence which has 
marked its diplomacy since World War II. For most of the Analysis 
</P>
<P>
past 40 years, Japanese governments have followed Washington's lead on 
political matters while building Japan's war-shattered economy into the 
second-largest and, probably, most robust in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear whether the Japanese only want to speak up and make sure they 
are heard or if they have something specific they want to push the United 
States on," Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that Takeshita is doing nothing more than following U.S. allies in 
Europe in demanding additional consultation on such subjects as U.S.-Soviet 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"A great many of these calls for more consultations have been justified," said 
Martin E. Weinstein, holder of the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. "I would hope that we would act in such a 
way that we won't have to hear any more of it." 
</P>
<P>
But a congressional staffer who specializes on Asia policy said Japan wants to 
be consulted on important issues but does not want to assume ultimate 
responsibility for shaping global events. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in world history has a country acquired so much wealth without acquiring 
military and political power," said the staff member, who declined to be 
identified by name. "You are going to see the second round of the Greater East 
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." 
</P>
<P>
The staff member's pointed use of the term that Japan applied to the 
expansionist policy of its military government in the late 1930s seems to 
reflect the skepticism Japan faces on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan trails Britain as a lender to the United States, the Japanese 
government, Japanese corporations and individuals have invested well over $100 
billion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to Commerce Department figures, Japanese residents and the government 
held $60.3 billion in U.S. Treasury securities at the end of 1987, the most 
recent year for which the report was available. In addition, Japanese owned $38 
billion in corporate stocks and bonds. They also held direct investments 
totaling $33.4 billion in corporations in which they own at least 10% of the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
However, it seems unlikely that Japan would try to use its economic leverage. 
Although the Japanese military establishment has grown substantially in recent 
years, Tokyo concedes that it is unable to defend itself without American 
assistance. Also, an economic confrontation between the United States and Japan 
would damage both nations, an outcome that neither country would relish.

NEW CARE FOR TORTURE'S OLD WOUNDS

<P>
A nightmare steals sleep from Gebyhu. 
</P>
<P>
Something heavy is crushing his body. "I try to call for help. I want someone 
to push the weight off. I try myself but I can't. I try to call to somebody. 
But I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Panicked, Gebyhu awakens: "I am sweating . . . breathing hard. I am scared." 
</P>
<P>
The same dream interrupts his sleep several times a week now. That is an 
improvement. It used to happen every night. It began during the five years he 
spent in an Ethiopian prison where, though never tried for a crime and only a 
teen-ager, he was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Reminders 
</P>
<P>
Gebyhu is haunted by other reminders of prison. His shoulders are dislocated. 
He experiences frequent pain. His concentration is poor. His ability to trust 
has eroded. He knows about man's inhumanity to man. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they held burning newspaper to our backs." Gebyhu recalls. 
"Sometimes they poured hot oil on our heads. Sometimes," he adds, "they would 
pull out (finger)nails with pliers." 
</P>
<P>
For Gebyhu (he asked that his real name not be used), the scars remain vivid 
but the healing has begun. He is more fortunate than most. 
</P>
<P>
At 29, he belongs to a huge but largely invisible population of refugees who 
settled in the United States after being tortured -- psychologically and 
physically, and often gruesomely -- in their home countries. But unlike the 
vast majority of victimized refugees, Gebyhu is among the early beneficiaries 
of a budding treatment specialty that recognizes that torture survivors have 
special problems that make it difficult for them to function free of their own 
personal nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Centers Exist 
</P>
<P>
So far, these victims far outnumber society's ability to aid them. Gebyhu, for 
instance, is a patient at Chicago's Marjorie Kovler Center for the Treatment of 
Survivors of Torture. Along with the Center for Victims of Torture in 
Minneapolis, it is one of only two full-service centers in the United States 
designed to help this uniquely burdened group of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
More critically, perhaps, medical knowledge of how best to treat the survivors 
is only in the pioneering stage. Surprisingly little is known about them, and 
for now professionals must rely mostly on what has been learned about victims 
of other kinds of psychological traumas. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe their needs to be something unique," says Douglas A. Johnson, 
executive director of the Minneapolis center. "We need to do outcome research 
to find out whether or not we are having impact." 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, 80% of the state's 2,000 Ethiopian refugees are victims of 
torture. "It's the most severely abused refugee population in the state," 
Johnson says. "We believe that we have a minimum of 2,000 and as many as 8,000 
torture victims living in Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago there are an estimated 20,000 survivors, reports Antonio Martinez, 
coordinator of the Kovler center, where 79 clients have been accepted in the 
facility's initial 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, which has the country's highest concentration of 
torture survivors among its huge refugee population, the Walter Briehl Human 
Rights Foundation in Los Angeles is treating refugees and hopes to open a 
full-service center later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers estimate the majority of victims in Southern California are 
Salvadorans. Psychiatrist Harvey Weintraub, president of the Briehl Foundation, 
says that there are also large numbers of people at risk among refugees from 
Southeast Asia, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq and Armenians emigrating from Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody seems to be torturing everybody all over the world," says Weintraub, 
who is treating survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The first clinic dedicated to helping torture victims opened in Copenhagen in 
1982. Others operate in Toronto and Paris. Assistance is also available in San 
Francisco and Newark, N.J. But, given the amount of torture in the world, there 
are surprisingly few centers overall. Amnesty International has documented 
torture and ill treatment of prisoners in at least 98 countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor Helped 
</P>
<P>
The Minneapolis facility, launched with help from Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, 
opened in 1985. The Chicago center -- operated under the auspices of Travelers 
&amp; Immigrants Aid -- received a boost from entrepreneur Peter Kovler and 
opened in mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
Because the organized treatment of torture survivors is a relatively new field 
for medicine and social work, specialists are in the early stages of finding 
the best forms of therapy. Meanwhile, they rely mainly on techniques used to 
treat other post-traumatic syndromes resulting from rape, Vietnam experiences, 
family sexual abuse and natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the torture victim different is that they are targets of a 
strategic manipulation of their personalities," says Johnson. "With other kinds 
of victimization there is always the hope for rescue by some third party. The 
child can be rescued by another parent. The crime victim can be rescued -- even 
if they aren't -- by the police. There is the hope of some kind of rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're being tortured it's being done by your government, by your police 
department, it's all been bureaucratized to great banality in terms of the 
methodology used and in the sense there is no hope of rescue," says Johnson. 
"You are the ultimate target with life and death completely in the hands of not 
only a person, but a government." 
</P>
<P>
At the Minneapolis Center, site of American threshold research on how to best 
help torture survivors, refugees accepted for treatment receive a physical 
examination and a psychiatric assessment and are then assigned to a long-term 
therapist. Simultaneously they work with a social worker who coordinates their 
overall treatment. Many also receive physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody who has been tortured suffers from chronic pain of one sort 
or another -- neck problems, back problems," says Thomas M. Dixon, clinical 
supervisor of Chicago's Kovler center. 
</P>
<P>
"Torture victims tend to relive the experience because it is often triggered by 
a common everyday object or occurrence," says Johnson. "For example, waiting is 
a very critical part of the torture experience. We schedule people so they do 
not have to wait. So that when they come in they are given attention 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to avoid the use of a lot of electronic equipment in the examination 
procedures because people are often tortured with electricity or by rather 
formal, medical-looking equipment," adds Johnson, whose Minneapolis outpatient 
clinic is located in a two-story house to avoid an institutional appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of torture is to destroy a person's personality so that they will 
forever be subjugated to the torturer, to the power source." says Dixon. "It is 
the complete destruction of trust at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
The official international definition of torture is spelled out by the United 
Nations. "Torture . . . means any act by which severe pain or suffering, 
whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation 
of a public official," to obtain "from him or a third person information or 
confession, punishing him for an act he has committed, or intimidating him or 
other persons." The United Nations adds that, "Torture constitutes an 
aggravated and deliberate form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Torture is something much more personal to Gebyhu. 
</P>
<P>
He was just 17 when he was taken off to prison along with his father and his 
older brother. They were arrested in 1977, in the aftermath of a communist 
military coup that deposed the late Emperor Haile Selassie. Their crime: 
Gebyhu's father was a security guard for the deposed royal family and his 
mother was a land owner. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Gebyhu says softly, slowly, the police came at night. "When they 
came after nine o'clock we knew they wanted someone to kill. Everybody sat very 
still. Everybody tried not to look at the eyes of the police. Nobody. . . . It 
is hard to talk," he apologizes. 
</P>
<P>
His brother was taken away during one of these visits. Later the brother's 
clothes were returned to the family. "Only his clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Gebyhu was one of 9,000 in the prison. "We would sleep in crowded rooms. There 
was no place to turn. We would sleep holding the feet of someone who was lying 
the other way. And someone would hold your feet." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the hanging that still causes him pain. 
</P>
<P>
One day the guards came and told him to put his arms over a pole they held 
behind his back. They tied his hands. They raised the pole until Gebyhu's feet 
were off the ground. His upper arms carried the entire weight of his body. And 
while he was helplessly hanging . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They beat my feet. They left me there. On the second day they cut the rope. I 
fell to the ground. They tell me I was unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experiences Not Unusual 
</P>
<P>
Now Gebyhu's shoulders regularly dislocate. He is often in pain. And awful as 
they may seem, his experiences are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
It is common in Africa for torture victims to have the bottoms of their feet 
beaten, in Latin America to be forced to eat decomposed food and excrement and 
to have body parts mutilated, and in Vietnam to be subjected to isolation and 
other forms of psychological torture, reports Martinez, coordinator of 
Chicago's Kovler clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Social worker Holbrook Teter, coordinator of the San Francisco-based Coalition 
to Aid Refugee Survivors of Torture and War Trauma, says: "I've worked with 
Salvadorans, both men and women, who have been subjected to electroshock 
treatment, who were hung by their thumbs, beaten, sexually abused. They had 
their heads submerged in water, they had hoods filled with lye put over their 
heads burning their scalps." 
</P>
<P>
"There are survivors who have had cattle prods inserted into their vaginas and 
men and women who had electricity applied to their genitals," says Dixon of the 
Chicago center. "One survivor was pregnant and guards put a dead fetus in her 
urine can. Husbands are forced to watch their wives being tortured and wives 
are forced to watch their husbands being abused and parents their children 
tortured." 
</P>
<P>
Of 34 patients who received long-term treatment at the Minneapolis clinic, all 
were beaten and subjected to isolation and overcrowding and threatened with 
death, forced to watch others killed or tortured or were taunted with mock 
execution. More than half were kept in uncomfortable positions or had their 
bodies suspended in painful positions for long periods of time and more than a 
third were burned with either boiling liquid, chemicals, cigarettes or 
electricity. A third also had their feet beaten. 
</P>
<P>
One outrageous aspect of torture is the frequent "complicity of the medical 
profession," says Martinez, a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of doctors who are accomplices in these situations. . . . The 
torturer has a doctor by his side so he knows where to put the electrodes, 
where to go so not to kill the person . . . where to cut so not to kill the 
person," says Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
A range of symptoms commonly found among refugees who were subjected to torture 
include: An inability to sleep, flashbacks to instances of torture, 
nervousness, an inability to trust, hyper-activity, recurrent nightmares, 
robotic behavior, anger, an inability to enjoy normal life experiences, sexual 
dysfunction and tendencies toward suicide and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are pulled over by police they think they are going to be tortured 
again, they panic and they lose control of themselves," says Dixon. "We had one 
client who was going for a (medical) exam and he freaked out. He was strapped 
to the machine and he ripped off the belts and ran from the hospital. Later he 
said he thought he was going to be tortured again." 
</P>
<P>
Children who have either been subjected directly to torture or forced to watch 
a sibling or parent tortured have difficulty in school. Both their performance 
and their behavior suffers, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize calling them 'survivors' rather than victims," says Dixon, "so 
people don't carry this idea of being victimized, that that was the focal 
experience of their lives. They want to go on to more positive experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Going on is very much on Gebyhu's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attends College 
</P>
<P>
In the United States for the last 18 months, he is a student at Chicago's 
Truman College where his grades are good and he excels at mathematics. However, 
his constantly dislocating arms currently make it impossible for him to find a 
job and his prison experience is hurting his studies. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult," he says. "I don't have any concentration." 
</P>
<P>
And even here the terror continues for Gebyhu. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, his roommate, also an Ethiopian refugee, was murdered in a $70 
robbery at a downtown parking lot where he was working. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't use my real name," Gebhyu pleads with a reporter. "I am scared."

INMATE AIDS TEST SHOWS STARTLING RATE OF EXPOSURE 
</P>

<P>
The first major AIDS testing of California inmates has found that as many as 
2,184 felons infected with the virus entered state prison last year -- more 
than eight times the number of prisoners previously identified as having been 
exposed to the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
Blind tests conducted by the Department of Health Services for a monthlong 
period revealed that 2.55% of the men entering prison had been exposed to the 
AIDS virus -- nearly three times the rate of the general population. Among 
women entering prison during a two-month period, a startling 3.1% were found to 
be infected, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The results of the testing program, which did not reveal the identities of any 
inmates, prompted prison officials Thursday to renew their call for legislation 
that would permit them to test every prisoner for the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
"This continues to give support to the idea of mandatory testing," said Craig 
L. Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency. "We have 
about 2,000 (infected prisoners) out there and we know who about 250 of them 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a prison health problem of massive proportions, state officials said 
they are proposing the establishment of semi-autonomous penitentiary units that 
could each hold as many as 800 prisoners exposed to the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
If prison officials win approval for mandatory testing, they plan to place in 
these units all inmates who have tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus 
but have not yet developed symptoms of the disease. Prisoners who developed 
symptoms of the disease would be housed in separate facilities. 
</P>
<P>
State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer, who oversaw the study, said 
the blind tests demonstrate the need for continuing education among prisoners 
about AIDS and the ways in which it can be spread. 
</P>
<P>
"Every incarcerated person should receive education and the opportunity to be 
tested," Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
The study to determine the prevalence of AIDS in prison was conducted by 
examining the blood of 6,179 convicts during routine entrance physicals last 
spring. The blood of 655 other inmates could not be analyzed for various 
reasons, including that of 227 inmates believed to be intravenous drug users. 
Prison doctors were unable to obtain adequate blood samples from these drug 
users, who are considered to be at a much higher risk of contracting the virus. 
If they had been included in the study, Kizer said, it might have indicated an 
even higher rate of AIDS infection in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Of those prisoners whose blood was sampled, 137 men and 25 women tested 
positive for exposure to the virus, a rate of 2.55% for men and 3.1% for women. 
</P>
<P>
When extrapolated to provide an estimate for the entire year, the study 
calculated that between 1,404 and 1,957 men infected with AIDs entered prison. 
Similarly, between 105 and 227 infected women went to prison during 1988, the 
study concluded. Thus, at least 1,509 and as many as 2,184 AIDS carriers 
entered the prison system. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, there were 252 known inmates with AIDS, AIDS-related diseases or 
who had been exposed to the virus, according to the Department of Corrections. 
These prisoners are housed in special facilities at the California Medical 
Facility in Vacaville, the California Institution for Men in Chino and the 
California Institution for Women at Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Among Returnees 
</P>
<P>
The study also found that parole violators returning to prison were more likely 
to have been infected with the virus than inmates committed for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
And it showed that people arrested in the San Francisco Bay Area had a higher 
rate of AIDS infection than those from Southern California and the rest of 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the study underscored a longstanding disagreement between officials 
of the Department of Corrections and the Department of Health Services over the 
best course to follow in stopping the spread of AIDS in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Nadim Khoury, a deputy corrections director and the department's top doctor, 
said that prison officials need to know which inmates are infected to protect 
other inmates and prison guards. The department is already conducting a 
substantial education program to warn inmates of the dangers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Reality dictates that you need to know everything you can in order to treat 
them, provide psychological support and modify their behavior," Khoury said. "I 
am not against the civil rights of anyone, but I think there has to be a 
balance between the needs of the inmates who are infected, and the needs of 
inmates and staff who have not been infected." 
</P>
<P>
Kizer, however, the state's leading public health official, pointed out that 
significant problems remain to be resolved with a mandatory testing program, 
including that the tests are not always accurate. If prisoners were segregated 
according to their AIDS status, guards and inmates would be given a false sense 
of security and prisoners who were not infected could be mistakenly placed 
among convicts who are, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are trying to make it kind of a simple issue," Kizer said. "I 
think it's anything but simple." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Deukmejian Administration endorsed legislation that would have 
permitted prison officials to order all inmates to undergo AIDS testing. The 
measure by Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) died in the Assembly, but he has 
introduced a similar measure this session.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY FEELS IMPACT OF BROADER ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the good old days, Steve Westly would have uncontested claim on the 
chairmanship of the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that you haven't heard of Westly. If these were the good old days, 
that would not matter. Westly and the few thousand Californians who thrill to 
the long meetings and high-minded resolutions and tradition-bound organization 
charts of California's long-neglected Democratic Party would be conducting 
business as they always did -- which is to say quietly gardening in the grass 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
But these aren't the good old days. Westly has worked his way up through the 
ranks of the party to the threshold of the chairmanship just at time when the 
organization has been invested with important new powers and when former 
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. has decided to make the party chief's job 
his first objective in a long-awaited political comeback. 
</P>
<P>
As next week's election of the chairman approaches, however, Westly, vice 
chairman of the party, is not going to slaughter quietly. 
</P>
<P>
True enough, this mop-topped 32-year-old investment banker from Menlo Park 
seems vastly outmatched by the former two-term governor. 
</P>
<P>
Westly has never had a real leadership role in any campaign for public office. 
(Brown has been through many campaigns including two runs for President). 
Westly has raised but several thousands of dollars for Democratic politicians 
and causes (contrasted to $18 million claimed by Brown). 
</P>
<P>
Brown is outspending Westly probably 3 to 1 or more and has hired 13 full-time 
field organizers to help him campaign for this part-time job, which pays 
nothing except the promise of visibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Westly has something Brown cannot match. For eight years, Westly has been a 
diligent, friendly and attentive leader in the small, closed society of 
California Democratic Party politics. He has moved up from office to office to 
his position as vice chairman from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Rung at a Time 
</P>
<P>
These credentials are important in an organization steeped in a tradition of 
leadership earned one rung at a time. Brown is anything but a 
one-rung-at-a-time politician in the eyes of many party regulars who say that, 
until the former governor decided to run for chairman, he just laughed in their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is," Westly said, "is the party going to be run from the elected 
officials, top down? Or from the grass roots, bottom up?" 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins will have something new and bigger on his hands in 1989. Everyone 
agrees on that. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three-quarters of a century, the political parties of California 
have been on the decline. First came reformers with uncommon determination to 
prevent bossism. Add to that the modern power of television, a mobile migrant 
population and an electorate stubbornly determined to vote "for the candidate, 
not the party," and the organizations known as the Democratic and Republican 
parties receded. 
</P>
<P>
They hold conventions; they argue like the dickens and debate many worldly 
resolutions; they divide up into countless caucuses and committees, hear many 
speeches, and then they disappear until next time. 
</P>
<P>
They have provided virtually none of the money for campaigns. Sometimes they 
could field a few volunteer workers, but often not that either. Today, there 
are only a handful of people on the Democratic Party payroll and only two small 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Decision 
</P>
<P>
But tomorrow: Change. A recent court decision overturned a prohibition on 
parties supporting candidates in contested primaries. A minor matter to 
outsiders, perhaps. But up-and-coming politicians must now cultivate the local 
Democratic Party Central Committee. No more making fun of the party. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the voter-approved Proposition 73 campaign financing reform 
will broaden -- perhaps vastly -- the powers of the political parties. 
Candidates for state office face dramatic new limits on raising money. And that 
will make them increasingly dependent on a once-moribund party for money, 
old-fashioned help in voter registration and get out-the-vote drives. 
</P>
<P>
Westly, contrasting himself with Brown, is campaigning as a man who will listen 
to the concerns of the rank and file, who will not let the party be dominated 
by elected officials and who is eager to tackle the pick-and-shovel work of 
daily management. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates promise to make the party function as a partnership of elected 
officials, the rank and file and traditional power brokers such as 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
But convention delegates are split along fairly clear lines. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is strongest among delegates who believe that elected officials and 
political professionals need a bigger voice now that the party is becoming more 
important in elective politics. Westly is the favorite of those in the grass 
roots who insist that elected officials already meddle too much in party 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In the Politicians' Pockets' 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the politicians' pockets!" says Dianna Ludington in reference to 
Brown. Ludington is a Fontana activist and typical of Westly supporters. They 
oppose an expanded role for "politicians" in the party. "We're the ones -- me 
and hundreds like me -- who get these people elected." 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer at Westly headquarters put it even more bluntly: "Legislators and 
officials are there to legislate and make policy. We're there for politics. 
Don't tell us how to run our business." 
</P>
<P>
Given such a split, some Democrats believe Westly is not to be counted out in 
this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The rank-and-file grass-roots Democrats have always shown themselves to be 
independent from the political power brokers. There is a possibility of a very 
strong backlash against the power brokers, i.e. Jerry Brown. He is muscling in 
on what they see as their own turf," said one pro-Brown Democratic insider.

WELFARE MOTHER 'BREAKS THE ICE' FOR DIANA;

<P>
Linda Correa had a few folks over to her small, temporary apartment in Lower 
Manhattan after breakfast Thursday for coffee and a nice friendly chat -- 
Princess Diana, her guides and security guards. 
</P>
<P>
The Princess of Wales leaned against a kitchen wall, talking to her hostess 
about school and sharing the experience of being a parent. 
</P>
<P>
"After I broke the ice, the words just came out," said Correa, a homeless 
mother who is being housed and counseled at the Henry Street Settlement's Urban 
Family Center. "I felt very comfortable. She is a very soft person to talk to . 
. . . She said all her children liked dogs and museums and outings. She did not 
come all this way for nothing. Her visit gave me a lot of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, Correa said Diana sat down on a bed and the couch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'How I Became Homeless' 
</P>
<P>
"I told how I became homeless and where I plan on moving after this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"She asked how the kids are, how they are in school, what grades they are in 
and what they want to be when they grow up. She asked do we do a lot of 
cooking. How did we spend our time? She was telling about her kids, what they 
like, their toys and what grade they are in." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked Correa, who lost her home when her landlord died and his son sold 
the building, if she had ever thought she would meet royalty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dollar and a dream -- like a lottery," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Diana, cheered by ordinary people and jeered by demonstrators 
demanding an end to British rule in Northern Ireland, visited both New Yorks 
Thursday -- the world of the homeless and the black-tie world of the rich at a 
gala benefit for the Welsh National Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In this city where poverty and plenty rule side by side, the residents of a 
welfare hotel just down the block watched the audience emerge from their black 
limousines and enter the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the princess, 
splendid in a white sequined gown, presided over the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the Welsh National Opera made its American debut, performing 
Verdi's "Falstaff," Mayor Edward I. Koch entered -- stage left. 
</P>
<P>
His honor, dressed in a rumpled business suit, addressed the princess, and the 
audience in evening gowns and tuxedoes. 
</P>
<P>
"Your royal highness, I am out of dress code because I have a town hall meeting 
in the Bronx tonight," Koch said. "The city is graced with your presence." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that he hopes everything goes well because "when you go home, 
you will say you will have had a royal New York welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Koch then exited -- faster than an extra in the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who faces re-election this year, had been accused by some critics of 
being "a turncoat in a redcoat" for agreeing to greet the princess at all. And 
his welcome in a city where Irish-Americans make up a potent voting group, 
could be graded as a minimal salutation. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Brooklyn Academy of Music, several hundred pro-Irish demonstrators 
shouted their dislike of Britain's presence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"Princess Di, go home," they cried as she arrived in a motorcade guarded by 
police and federal agents carrying submachine guns. 
</P>
<P>
After the three-hour performance, Diana traveled to the Winter Garden at the 
World Financial Center, where she and more than 800 guests ranging from Happy 
Rockefeller, the widow of former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, to Bianca Jagger 
to Donald and Ivana Trump dined on a menu including breast of capon stuffed 
with morel mousse, baby winter vegetables and a tri-colored sorbet. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever Diana appeared Thursday, she received a royal welcome from 
royalty-hungry New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
"She left me the perfume," said Josephine Coll, sniffing her hand after the 
princess had approached her in the crowd outside the Henry Street Settlement 
and had shaken her hand. "She's very pretty and very nice." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lister also shook hands with Diana. "Wanna shake my hand -- $5," he told 
friends. "She has a beautiful face, nice hair." 
</P>
<P>
About 400 well-wishers cheered when Diana arrived at lunchtime at F.A.O. 
Schwarz, the huge 5th Avenue toy store, to promote a new high-priced line of 
British toys. When she departed, Allison Edwards, 15, of Rumson, N.J., handed 
her a bouquet of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so ecstatic, I could barely stand up," said the school girl who had 
waited outside the store since 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Diana received tulips from Quoc Tran, 10, a 5th-grader at an elementary school 
near the Henry Street Settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Why did you give her the flowers, the youngster was asked. "My art teacher told 
me to," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the day's events, the princess's visit to the settlement house was the 
most poignant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Real Princess' 
</P>
<P>
Diana, who had worked in a preschool before her marriage, met 11 children, aged 
2 to 5, at a branch of the shelter called The Family School. Many of the 
youngsters have been abused and are from homeless families. She tied the 
shoelaces of a little boy named Johnny. She looked at a valentine made by 
little Christopher and commented: "I love the Cupid in the heart. Is that for 
your mommie?" 
</P>
<P>
Before Diana walked into the room, Janet Holmes, the teacher, told one of the 
children: "She's a real princess, not a fairy tale, not Sleeping Beauty, not 
Cinderella."

OFFICIAL CALLS TRITIUM SUPPLY STRETCHABLE 
</P>

Failure to restart tritium gas production this year at the government's 
Savannah River, S. C., weapons plant eventually could impair the nation's 
nuclear arsenal, a top Energy Department official said Thursday. But his 
testimony suggested that the problem is less immediate than some officials had 
indicated earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Troy E. Wade II, the acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee that the need to restart Savannah River's three 
trouble-plagued reactors, which are the government's only source of tritium, 
"is becoming critical." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Energy Department will be able to stretch existing 
supplies of the gas at least to the end of 1989. Some officials had warned last 
year that a tritium shortage could occur as early as this summer -- and could 
force the cannibalizing of some nuclear weapons to keep others working. 
</P>
<P>
Wade, picking his words carefully, partly to avoid disclosing classified 
information about U.S. nuclear weapons production, said that, "if a reactor is 
not restarted this year, then the supply of tritium could be reduced to such an 
extent that the nuclear stockpile may be affected." 
</P>
<P>
He did not say, however, what effect such a tritium shortage would have on the 
weapons stockpile, which is believed to consist of about 22,000 missile 
warheads, gravity bombs and other munitions, such as artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Retire Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Independent experts have said that the government has a variety of options. 
They include accelerating retirement of older weapons, delaying production of 
new weapons and giving existing warheads only a partial recharge of the gas, 
enough to last two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen gas, is used to boost the power of 
nuclear weapons. Because it decays into helium at a rate of about 12% a year, 
it must be replenished every four to five years to maintain a weapon at full 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
All three Savannah River production reactors were shut down last spring and 
summer amid growing concern about their deteriorating conditions; all are over 
30 years old. There was also concern about the outdated, often slipshod safety 
practices of the plant's longtime operating contractor, E. I. du Pont de 
Nemours &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse Corp. is to assume management of the plant in April. 
</P>
<P>
Wade told the Senate committee that, despite continuing management problems at 
the plant, he believes it will be possible to restart one reactor by October. 
But the Energy Department's chief safety official, Richard Starostecki, was 
less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a skeptic," Starostecki said in response to a question by Sen. Albert 
Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) about the likelihood of meeting that deadline. "From a 
skeptic's point of view, a lot of things have to happen (at Savannah River), 
and they are not happening," Starostecki said. 
</P>
<P>
Gore asked if this meant that reviving one of the plant's reactors this year is 
"not likely," and Starostecki replied that, "based on performance to date, 
that's true." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Problems Found 
</P>
<P>
His pessimism was echoed by John Ahearne, chairman of a committee of outside 
technical advisers monitoring safety issues at the plant. "We are uncertain as 
to whether all technical problems (at Savannah River) have been identified," 
Ahearne said. "The closer we look, the more problems we find."

BID TO CONTAIN ANTARCTIC OIL SPILL STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foul weather off the tip of South America on Thursday forced one Argentine ship 
to abandon its effort to reach a stricken vessel that is leaking oil into the 
pristine waters off Antarctica, and scientists warned that as winter approaches 
in the Southern Hemisphere, storms could soon cut off any hopes of salvaging 
the ship and containing the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't solve it right away, the winter storms will tear it up," said 
UCLA marine biologist Bill Hamner, who has spent five seasons studying the area 
where the ship ran around last Saturday just two miles from the National 
Science Foundation's Palmer Station. A second Argentine vessel should arrive in 
the area today, but it is not clear if that ship is equipped to attempt salvage 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that the stricken ship was still afloat despite earlier 
reports that it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
Hamner and others said the accident could not have happened at a worse time for 
the wildlife in the area, particularly the penguins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds' Insulation in Peril 
</P>
<P>
One of Antarctica's largest penguin colonies is in the area, Hamner said, "and 
this is the time when the penguins are fishing most heavily" and young penguins 
are beginning to swim. 
</P>
<P>
That will expose them to the oily water and tar that could destroy the 
insulation system that protects them from the cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Hamner said the penguin's feathers trap a layer of air between "the skin and 
the outside, so the birds can swim in ice water, and they are not cold because 
they are beautifully insulated. It probably wouldn't require very much tar to 
break down the insulation and bring cold into direct contact with the body 
core." 
</P>
<P>
Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of the Antarctic staff for the National Science 
Foundation, told reporters in Santiago, Chile, that the greatest concern now is 
that the oil will affect the young birds. 
</P>
<P>
"All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first 
swim," he said. "When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could 
be the last time." 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports Thursday over just how much oil has already 
leaked from the vessel, which is 80% under water but still afloat, according to 
Jack Renirie, spokesman for the National Science Foundation in Washington. The 
Argentine Ministry of Defense initially said the leakage from the Argentine 
cruise ship, the Bahia Paraiso, "really wasn't a significant spill" but later 
conceded some contamination is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Observers in the area radioed to officials in Washington that a spill several 
miles long had been sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Any spill in such a pristine area is bound to have a serious local impact, 
although Renirie said the incident was not likely to be as "catastrophic" as 
some reports have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a tanker," Renirie said. The ship was carrying about 250,000 
gallons of bunker oil used for its own propulsion system, plus 200 barrels of 
other types of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, large tankers carry many millions of gallons of oil and are 
capable of creating massive oil slicks during accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the area is running in the mid-40s, because it is still 
summer in Antarctica, but winter is rapidly approaching. Heavy storms could hit 
the area by the end of this month, and by late March the weather is expected to 
be so foul that little could be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed Every Animal 
</P>
<P>
When the tanker Tampico ran aground near Ensenada in April, 1957, it released 
diesel fuel into the Pacific, and Stewart said it proved extremely toxic to 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"It essentially killed every animal in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear arrived in Chile on Thursday aboard a 
U.S. Air Force C-5B. From there the experts and their equipment were to be 
loaded aboard the U.S. research ship Polar Duke for the 600-mile, four-day trip 
to Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
All 316 persons aboard the 435-foot Bahia Paraiso were rescued by other vessels 
in the area.

AILING S. AFRICAN PRESIDENT GIVES UP PARTY LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ailing President Pieter W. Botha resigned Thursday as leader of South Africa's 
ruling white National Party, and Education Minister Frederik W. de Klerk, a 
more conservative politician, was swiftly elected to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Botha said he will retain the job of state president, the move 
appeared to signal the first step toward the end of Botha's 10-year rule, a 
decision hastened by a mild stroke the 73-year-old leader suffered two weeks 
ago. It also established De Klerk, 52, as Botha's most likely successor. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts believe that the new party leader, though he has been a 
supporter of Botha's programs in the past, will slow down the step-by-step 
reform process begun under Botha and alienate more liberal party members. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a definite setback for those within the National Party who argued for 
an enlightened reform process," Willie Kleynhans, a professor of political 
science at the University of South Africa, said in an interview Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, leader of the party in Transvaal province, declined Thursday to 
discuss his political agenda. He attempted to minimize his elevation, calling 
it "a party political affair with no direct or formal constitutional 
implications." 
</P>
<P>
But analysts who closely follow National Party politics say De Klerk is the 
most likely replacement for Botha, perhaps when Botha's term expires in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Under South Africa's constitution, the majority party in the white chamber of 
Parliament -- presently the National Party -- has total control over the 
election of the president. The National Party is favored to retain its large 
majority in the next general election, which Botha must call within the next 
year. Before his illness, Botha expressed a desire to see his party through one 
more general election. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the presidential succession began two weeks ago when Botha 
suffered a stroke at his residence here. He lost some strength in his left arm 
and leg, but his doctors say he is recovering well. While Botha recuperates, 
his senior Cabinet minister, J. Chris Heunis, is acting state president. 
</P>
<P>
For several months Botha has indicated that he wants to reduce the 
responsibilities of the president, perhaps by creating the position of prime 
minister to take care of ceremonial duties. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's resignation after 10 years as party leader came in a letter delivered 
to a National Party caucus here on the eve of the opening of a new session of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The president asked that the traditionally overlapping jobs of government and 
party leader be separated to reduce the workload. The 130-member caucus agreed 
and, on a third ballot, chose De Klerk over Finance Minister Barend du Plessis 
by a vote of 69 to 61, the state-run broadcasting company reported. 
</P>
<P>
Botha has presided over the first important racial reforms undertaken by the 
National Party since it instituted the apartheid system in 1948. Essentially, 
these reforms have attempted to extend some political power to the black 
majority, without giving up white minority control, and to ease segregation, 
without eliminating it.

EUROPEANS URGED TO PLAY GREATER MIDEAST ROLE

Participants in a Middle East conference concluded Thursday that Western Europe 
should play a stronger role in trying to put an end to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Penders, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said the countries of 
the European Community could serve as intermediary for negotiations, provide 
peacekeeping forces and give technical and economic assistance to a new state. 
</P>
<P>
The European countries, he said, should emphasize to Israel that it "has to 
accept the formula of land for peace." 
</P>
<P>
David Susskind, a leader of Belgium's Jewish community, said it is "time for 
Europe to help (Israel and the Palestinians) build a peaceful situation 
side-by-side." 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian newspaper editor Hanna Siniora, who has been jailed by the 
Israelis, said there must be "a clear voice from Europe" raised against what he 
called Israeli repression in the occupied territories, the West Bank of the 
Jordan River and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Siniora argued that European countries should help in education and health 
because Israel has closed schools in the territories and "discriminated against 
Arabs seeking health services in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
He recommended setting up a "Palestinian-Israeli-European Center" to monitor 
human rights violations in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason the Europeans must become involved, he said, is that "they set 
political trends that are later adopted by the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The European Community, since its Venice Declaration of 1980, has been much 
more supportive of the creation of an independent Palestinian state than has 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Meir Pa-il, a retired colonel and peace activist and former member of the 
Knesset, Israel's Parliament, said Europe should work to persuade the Israeli 
government to deal with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the Dutch and attended by Europeans, dovish 
Israelis and moderate Palestinians in an effort to determine what role the 
European Community might play in a peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Sami Moussalem, director of the Tunis headquarters of PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat, said the European Community should be more than a matchmaker between 
Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans, he said, should not limit themselves to "just bringing the sides 
together." He said they "have a very important role in confidence-building." 
</P>
<P>
Europe could act as a counterbalance to the superpowers in an international 
peace conference on the Middle East, Moussalem said. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis attending the conference seemed to be unconcerned about an Israeli law 
that prohibits Israeli citizens from meeting with terrorists, including members 
of the PLO. Several members of the PLO were present.

PARAGUAY GENERAL STAGES REBELLION AGAINST STROESSNER

ASUNCION, Paraguay 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This country's second most powerful military officer, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, 
said early today that he has rebelled against the government of President 
Alfredo Stroessner to restore democracy to this landlocked South American 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Rodriguez was read on radio station March 1 hours after cannon 
and automatic weapons fire broke out in this capital Thursday night. The firing 
continued through the early hours of today. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a spokesman for the opposition claimed that Stroessner had been placed 
under arrest by army rebels, the Associated Press reported. The news agency 
said there were no other details of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, which the radio station repeated every five minutes, 
Rodriguez said: 
</P>
<P>
"We have left our barracks in defense of the honor of the armed forces; for the 
full and total unification of the (ruling) Colorado Party in the government; 
for the initiation of democracy in Paraguay; for the respect of human rights; 
for the defense of our Roman, Christian, Apostolic, Catholic religion." 
</P>
<P>
Radio Caritas, a station owned by the Roman Catholic Church, also later 
broadcast Rodriguez's statement. 
</P>
<P>
He called on his comrades in arms to support his move, which he described as 
being for the benefit of the Paraguayan people. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner, who is also an army general and commander in chief of the country's 
armed forces, has ruled Paraguay for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gunfire was first reported near the headquarters on Asuncion's outskirts of the 
1st Army Corps, where Rodriguez's 1st Cavalry Division is based. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks rumbled into the city, and heavy fighting broke out in the center of 
Asuncion, a city of 900,000, shortly before midnight Thursday as tanks hammered 
the central police station, setting it ablaze. The station, which occupies a 
full city block, is situated only a few hundred yards from Lopez Palace, the 
presidential office building. 
</P>
<P>
Fighter aircraft flew over the city. Radio Caritas reported that tanks had 
surrounded Lopez Palace and that artillery fire was heard at the headquarters 
of the navy, six miles outside Asuncion. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Caritas added that employees of the city's two television stations, which 
had interrupted their transmissions before the firing began in the center of 
Asuncion, said that naval officers had occupied their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
No information on casualties was available. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the police and the Presidential Guard, a special armed 
forces detachment, had remained loyal to Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
Gunfire was also reported near the international airport and in various 
residential areas of the capital where government officials and top military 
officers have their homes. The home of Gen. Rodriguez was reported to be 
protected by a cordon of tanks from his cavalry division. 
</P>
<P>
Aldo Zucolillo, owner of the newspaper ABC Color, which was shuttered by the 
Stroessner government four years ago, said by telephone that armored cars 
passed through his residential neighborhood early today and that he could hear 
the continuing sound of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the first since Stroessner, 76, took power in August, 1954, 
after a period of civil strife and anarchy during which Paraguay had seven 
presidents in seven years. Stroessner has ruled the nation dictatorially ever 
since, having been reelected president every five years in balloting that until 
recent times included not even a token opposition candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 64, is the father-in-law of one of Stroessner's children. Diplomats 
and opposition political leaders said that Rodriguez recently has resisted 
orders from Stroessner to leave his active troop command and either retire or 
accept the post of defense minister in Stroessner's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Stroessner's hitherto all-powerful Colorado Party, effectively the 
only political party allowed to operate, split when an orthodox faction known 
as the militants won the party leadership and expelled the so-called 
traditionalists. 
</P>
<P>
Since then there has been open confrontation between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Stroessner reportedly has been in ill health since he underwent a 
prostate operation five months ago. His apparent slow recovery has fueled 
demands by opposition leaders that the army and the Colorado Party consider a 
transition to democratic rule.

BUSH PICKS CONTRA AID FIGURE AS ENVOY TO MEXICO

President Bush has decided to nominate John D. Negroponte, a veteran diplomat 
who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of 
ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to 
Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which 
has not been formally announced. But Bush Administration officials said they 
are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari will accept the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Reject Nomination 
</P>
<P>
Under diplomatic practice, the White House notifies other governments in 
advance of its choices for ambassadors. The foreign government can reject the 
nomination, but rejection would be considered an unusual diplomatic slap. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America, 
Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from 
several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and 
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment 
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said. Helms questioned the 
appointment of a Democrat to the post, and Lugar expressed concern that Aronson 
had no experience with the economic issues facing South America, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block 
Aronson's nomination but that the former aide to President Jimmy Carter will 
face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte created controversy in Honduras as a vigorous proponent of the 
then-secret Contra effort; and Honduran opposition leaders, who said he acted 
as though he were the governor of a colony, dubbed him Washington's "proconsul" 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the Ronald Reagan 
Administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support 
for its policy in Central America, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President 
Reagan's last national security adviser, and had been an aide to Henry A. 
Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, during 
the Vietnam war in 1970-73. 
</P>
<P>
He has also worked on negotiations with Mexico on environmental and 
tuna-fishing issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the smartest operators in the business," a former aide said. "He's 
very good at working the bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to 
register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of 
the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not 
object formally. 
</P>
<P>
"They will blow a little steam off in the press, but I don't think the Mexican 
government would dream of rejecting him," one official said. "They don't want 
to get relations with the Bush Administration off on that footing." 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte, 49, will succeed Charles Pilliod, an Ohio industrialist.

3 MAJOR SOCIAL BILLS OFF TO FAST START; 
</P>
<P>
BACKERS CHALLENGE 'KINDER' BUSH TO FAVOR BLOCKED LEGISLATION

Congressional backers of major social legislation that was blocked by 
Republican-led filibusters last fall are challenging President Bush to show his 
"kinder, gentler" side by quickly endorsing an increase in the federal minimum 
wage, a family and medical leave bill and a compromise child care bill. 
</P>
<P>
Pushed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee, and several key Republicans, the three measures are 
off to a fast start in the new session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Backers said they expect Bush to give positive signals on the legislation next 
Thursday when he will go to Capitol Hill to announce his program and revisions 
in the budget submitted by former President Ronald Reagan last month. 
</P>
<P>
Even without Bush's support, however, the prospects for passage of some 
variations of the three measures were regarded as better than they have been in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Less Ideological President' 
</P>
<P>
"We are out of a very strong ideological period (under Ronald Reagan), and we 
have a less ideological President, judging by his Cabinet appointments," 
Kennedy said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The measures last year were blocked by conservatives who charged they would add 
to business costs, cause elimination of some jobs and make U.S. businesses less 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing a family and medical leave bill Thursday, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) said it was essential to provide a way for working parents to take 
time off for family and medical emergencies without losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an idea whose time has come," Dodd said. Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) 
indirectly prodded Bush by saying: "We are trying to provide a kinder, gentler 
atmosphere in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Marge Roukemma (R-N.J.), sponsor of a similar bill in the House, added: 
"Republicans must go beyond lip service in our devotion to family values" and 
predicted at least tacit support of the measure by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd's bill would require employers of 20 or more workers to grant up to 10 
weeks of unpaid leave in event of childbirth, adoption or serious illness of a 
child. It would require up to 13 weeks of unpaid time off in the event of an 
employee's serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said another bill to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage to $4.65 an 
hour in three steps would be approved next Wednesday by his committee, in the 
hope that Bush would take a position soon and the Senate then could be "ready 
for action" in March. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure -- but with a $4.55 maximum rate -- was blocked by a 
filibuster in the Senate after Reagan threatened to veto the bill. It still 
faces massive opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush called for a higher minimum wage in the election campaign, he has 
not mentioned a figure and said it would have to be accompanied by a "training 
wage" below the proposed rate for new workers -- a feature strongly opposed by 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
"We will increase the minimum wage in this Congress," Kennedy said in an 
interview. "I hope we'll do it with the Administration's support, but we can do 
without it, if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy already has met with Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and previewed 
his legislative timetable with White House officials in hopes that the 
Administration will prepare alternatives to bills marked for fast-track 
consideration in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
After the minimum wage bill and the family and medical leave bill, the Senate 
Labor Committee hopes to get bipartisan agreement on more controversial child 
care legislation. In this area, Bush is expected to endorse use of the tax code 
to allocate payments of up to $1,000 to working parents for day care of their 
children. Dodd, with some backing from key conservative Sen. Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah), has proposed a program costing up to $2.5 billion a year that would 
establish federal standards for child care centers as well as channel federal 
funds to lower-income working families. 
</P>
<P>
Asked where the funds would be found for expanded social programs in view of 
the massive federal deficit, Kennedy said that if Bush drops the idea of 
increasing the defense budget by 2% after offsetting any inflation, it would 
free $8 billion for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TESTING BUSH'S 'KINDER, GENTLER' VISION 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of three major bills being readied by Democrats and Republican 
allies for early congressional action this year: 
</P>
<P>
MINIMUM WAGE -- An increase from the present $3.35 hourly rate to $4.65 in 
three stages, with an exemption for smaller business firms and adjustments in 
the tip credit allowed for hotel and restaurant owners. Senate Labor Committee 
approval expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY, MEDICAL LEAVE -- Requires firms with more than 20 employees (50 
employees in the House version) to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave to 
workers with more than a year's service in case of childbirth, adoption or 
serious illness of a child or elderly parent. Introduced in Senate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CHILD CARE -- Authorizes $2.5 billion a year to aid low-income working families 
with child care expenses and sets minimum health and safety standards for child 
care programs supported by public funds. Introduced in Senate last month.

RUNAWAY RAILROAD CARS SET OFF 2 EXPLOSIONS IN MONTANA CAPITAL

<P>
Two explosions caused by runaway railroad cars rocked Montana's capital city 
Thursday, cutting off electricity and forcing the evacuation of thousands of 
people as wind chills dipped to 70 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway cars derailed and hit a propane tank near the railroad tracks, 
setting off an explosion. Minutes later, the fire from the blast caused one of 
the derailed cars containing a flammable chemical to blow up, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A second car containing plastic also burned, producing a cloud of black smoke 
that prompted the evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Windows Shatter 
</P>
<P>
The force of the early morning blasts overturned automobiles, shattered windows 
at a nearby college and homes and hurled pieces of railroad car through 
buildings a quarter-mile away, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle no one was killed or injured," said Ed Schild, Lewis and Clark 
County undersheriff. Two minor injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Russell Ritter estimated the damage at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened as a severe cold snap paralyzed the state. Gov. Stan 
Stephens shut down state government throughout Montana, citing the cold 
temperatures, power outages and noxious fumes emitted by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in an open area on the city's west side and severed one 
of three major power lines, officials said. Although power was knocked out for 
37,000 people, electricity was restored to most areas by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Federal Railroad Administration said the incident began when 
a cab heater malfunctioned in a Montana Rail Link locomotive hauling 48 freight 
cars over the Continental Divide west of Helena. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew stopped the freight to exchange the lead locomotive for another lead 
locomotive with a better heater . . . ," the FRA said in a statement. "This 
maneuver required them to disconnect the locomotives from the 48 freight cars 
being hauled. 
</P>
<P>
"When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crew returned to pick up 
the freight cars only to find they were gone," it said, adding that the cars 
had rolled 12 miles east to Helena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
21 Cars Derailed 
</P>
<P>
The railroad agency said the runaway cars hit another locomotive and 21 of the 
cars derailed. One of those cars hit a propane tank alongside the track, the 
agency said, touching off an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities evacuated more than 4,000 people from an area one square mile 
around the burning railroad cars, said Col. Gary Blair, the adjutant general 
for Montana's National Guard. City Manager Bill Verwolf put the number 
evacuated at about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuees fled to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the National Guard armory 
and schools, which were already closed by the cold.

KICKBACKS TO NAVAJO OFFICIALS ALLEGED 
</P>

<P>
The chairman of the Navajo Indian tribe has received kickbacks of at least 
$125,000 since 1986 -- including cash, expensive remodeling and hotel expenses 
-- by companies vying for construction contracts on the reservation, two 
contractors told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors, both white, said that they had set up dummy firms headed by 
Indians whose sole purpose was to qualify for jobs reserved for the minority 
group. They and their Indian colleagues said they believe they had to make 
payments to tribal chairman Peter MacDonald Sr. to get business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gave the Money to Mr. MacDonald' 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the money to Mr. MacDonald because I thought he would give us a fairer 
opportunity to perform our trade on the reservation," Pat Chee Miller, one of 
the Indian executives, said of the nearly $10,000 he gave to MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
A tribal spokesman said that MacDonald had no immediate response to the 
allegations but that the tribe would send a delegation to Washington next week 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Contractor John Paddock, who was given immunity from prosecution by the 
committee, testified that his payments to MacDonald totaled more than $110,000, 
including free use of Paddock's company plane, a $35,000 loan that has never 
been repaid and $1,220 for a birthday party for MacDonald's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Paddock said he thought that the costs were the price of doing business on the 
reservation and that in one instance the payoffs helped his company gain the 
necessary certification to do reservation work. 
</P>
<P>
Paddock also said that under-the-table payments he made to MacDonald brought a 
request from the tribal chairman for his firm to do a $650,000 renovation of 
MacDonald's office complex, although the construction company was never asked 
to follow through on the work. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the improvements, eventually done by others, were extravagant. 
"They were talking in terms of solid mahogany paneling, the faucets were to be 
gold-plated, the tiles were to have turquoise inlays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman in MacDonald's office said that tribal officials moved late 
Thursday to form a task force to appear before the Senate committee. Tazbah 
McCullah said that officials probably will travel to Washington Monday or 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, the Navajo tribal council criticized "malicious . . . attempts 
to discredit the integrity of the Navajo nation" and said that "a great number 
of people . . . have been summoned before the Senate special investigators, 
threatened and sometimes offered immunity if they would just say something 
negative about the Navajo nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud, Corruption Evidence 
</P>
<P>
The hearings follow nearly a year of FBI and congressional investigation that 
senators said turned up evidence of fraud and corruption in tribal and federal 
governments, tribal ties to organized crime and child abuse in government-run 
schools on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The special subcommittee of the Select Indian Affairs Committee, chaired by 
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), also will examine housing, health-care, law 
enforcement and natural resource problems on Indian reservations.

CAR-CRASH MURDER CONVICTIONS UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court in Santa Ana on Thursday overturned the murder 
convictions of a man who killed two teen-agers in a car crash as he fled from 
police, ruling that discrimination against Asians and Latinos was evident 
during jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled 3 to 0 that the exclusion of a 
Vietnamese immigrant because of what the prosecutor stated was his inability to 
understand English was illegally based on a racial stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
In a 16-page opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin, the court also found 
that Valle's rights were violated during a police interrogation after his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Valle was the first person ever convicted of murder in Orange County in a 
case involving traffic deaths. Valle, driving a stolen van and chased by Costa 
Mesa police on Dec. 19, 1984, ran a stop sign and rammed a car carrying two 
Estancia High School students, Roy Williamson and Billy Dearing, both 17. 
</P>
<P>
Both boys were killed. Valle was convicted in 1986 of two counts of 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King said his office would consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
King showed bias by disqualifying Tuoc Vo, a mechanic and Vietnamese immigrant, 
when there were no proper legal grounds to do so, the court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion, King stated that "members of the Oriental race" can 
have difficulty learning English and can have "serious problems in 
understanding words that have abstract meanings to them." 
</P>
<P>
Valle's attorney, J. Courtney Shevelson of Monterey, said King failed to 
establish that Vo had such problems. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also found that King had improperly rejected a Latino for jury 
service.

AIDS HOSPICE GETS OCCUPANCY PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest AIDS hospice in Los Angeles has received its permanent certificate 
of occupancy and is running "smoothly" after problems over fire and building 
codes were straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Hospice Foundation, said the Chris 
Brownlie AIDS Hospice in Elysian Park has met requirements for a permit that 
allows it to operate as a dormitory. Before the new category was established, 
the two-story wood-frame building could not meet the fire codes for medical 
buildings with patients confined to their beds. 
</P>
<P>
There are 10 residents in the facility now, and by the end of March, the 25 
available beds should be filled, Weinstein said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NO AIRHEAD ON AVIATION FACTS, EVEN WRONG ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of the nation's premier repositories of aviation history and artifacts, 
the Aerospace Museum in Balboa Park gets calls every day from scholars, 
journalists and flight buffs. 
</P>
<P>
The queries can be general -- "Tell me something about the development of jets" 
-- or quite specific -- "What were the names of the crew members in the fourth 
plane that took off in Jimmy Doolittle's raid?" Archivist Ray Wagner handles 
them all with aplomb, using the museum's 50 file cabinets of documents, 
histories and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Even by those standards, a dozen or so letters and long-distance calls asking 
the same question recently were unique. Many were in French. And all were 
asking about something that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the Paris newspaper Le Figaro was running a contest with 
multiple-choice questions, including one asking which of three aviators was the 
pilot on a historic 1936 flight from San Diego to Moscow. Unbeknown to Le 
Figaro, the second-largest paper in France, there was no such flight. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a historic 1936 flight from Santa Monica to Moscow, and the 
pilot, Sigsmund Levaneski (a.k.a. "the Soviet Lindbergh"), was among the three 
choices provided by Le Figaro. He flew a 27 Downey Vultee, from the 
Downey-based Vultee aircraft works, which later merged with San Diego's 
Consolidated, giving rise to Convair. 
</P>
<P>
Providing the information about Levaneski (including the fact that he 
disappeared over the North Pole on a return flight) was no problem for Wagner, 
64, a retired history teacher and author of several books on aviation. Asking 
about a 27 Downey Vultee is like asking him what he had for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part was struggling with my college French," Wagner said. "The 
first caller spoke no English and apparently thought that, if there was anyone 
of any intelligence here, they would, of course, speak French. Somehow we 
managed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is That Clear? 
</P>
<P>
The Public Utilities Commission will meet today in San Diego to discuss rules 
for the upcoming hearing on the proposed merger of SDG&amp;E and Southern 
California Edison. But don't figure on the controversy being less complex once 
the hearing is held. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC this week issued a new guide to the hearing process -- not the issues, 
just the process. It's 103 pages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
America's Pub Race 
</P>
<P>
Move over America's Cup Race. Make room for America's Pub Race, the latest 
entry in seafaring competition. It began when U. S. and New Zealand journalists 
began arguing at Bula's Pub &amp; Eatery in Coronado over which country 
produces the best sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a challenge was set. Sail in one-man, 14-foot Lasers from Coronado to 
the Embarcadero in San Diego, hoist a few at Anthony's restaurant, sail to the 
Charthouse restaurant near the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, hoist a few more, 
then sail into Glorietta Bay, land in Coronado and play your respective 
national anthem on the musical instrument of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
For the latter part of the contest, the two Kiwis, brothers Bill and Hugo 
Manson, chose bagpipes and a kazoo. The Americans, Joseph Ditler and Larry 
Edwards, chose a fiddle and a Jew's harp. 
</P>
<P>
America's Cup loser Michael Fay learned of the grudge match and sent his New 
Zealand countrymen a telegram wishing them "favorable winds and a strong 
drinking arm." 
</P>
<P>
They proved to have both, placing first and third and winning on cumulative 
time. A 3-inch trophy in their honor now rests above the bar at Bula's. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure the whole thing cost $42.50, which is $59,999,957.50 less than the 
America's Cup," Bill Manson said. "We only had one rule: Nobody resorts to 
lawyers to overturn the decision."

 TRAILERS OFFERED TO CITY FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica may receive 10 trailers to serve as shelters for homeless people 
-- if officials can find a place to park them. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica City Councilman David Finkel said the trailers will be supplied by 
Los Angeles, which acquired the portable shelters last year but ran into 
neighborhood opposition in trying to place them. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel said he anticipates similar resistance once Santa Monica pinpoints a 
place for the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said the plan represents a "wonderful opportunity" for the 
city to help the homeless, including some of the transients who live in 
Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce are helping Finkel in his 
search for a site where the trailers can be parked.

 POLICE PLAN TO OPEN PALISADES SUBSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a series of fatal accidents involving Pacific Palisades youths 
during the last two years, community leaders have persuaded Los Angeles police 
to open a substation this month and to add an extra patrol in the affluent 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After meetings with police officials from the West Los Angeles Division, the 
Palisades Chamber of Commerce agreed to donate its office space for the 
substation, which will allow officers to file criminal reports in the area 
rather than returning to headquarters several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 19 months, 10 young residents of the community, including seven 
students at Palisades High School, have suffered violent deaths, most involving 
alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce President Arnie Wishnick said residents will continue to 
meet with police to see if they can find a way to staff the substation full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current plan, the substation, which will be open for use 24 hours, 
will only be used by officers who want to cut down on their travel time filing 
their reports in the chamber office.

TANK TRUCK SPILLS OIL ON I-805 AS RAIN BRINGS MISHAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roads slick from intermittent showers, which are expected to last through 
Sunday, contributed to several San Diego-area auto accidents Thursday morning, 
the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:55 a.m., a tanker truck jackknifed on Interstate 805 southbound near Mira 
Mesa Boulevard after a car entering the freeway struck the front axle of the 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker trailer unhitched and ended nose down, spilling 700 gallons of 
petroleum over the southbound lanes. Firefighters used sand barriers and 
plastic wading pools to contain the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Mullen, 18, the driver of the car, was injured and was taken to Scripps 
Memorial Hospital-La Jolla for observation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrival of a Cold Front 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from San Diego, Del Mar and Solana Beach aided in cleaning up the 
spill. There were no injuries to the truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
About 14 vehicles were involved in four separate fender-benders on California 
163 between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. No serious injuries were reported, the CHP 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A collision of another sort seems to be the cause of the rains. 
</P>
<P>
Chill air from an Alaskan cold wave traveling down California in a low-pressure 
system has collided with warm air coming up from Mexico, causing periodic light 
rains that are expected to last through Sunday, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters predict a 30% to 40% chance of showers this weekend. Otherwise, it 
will be partly cloudy and breezy at times, with cool temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be a bad weekend," forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
"But you can't rule out the showers. The rain we get should be small rains, so 
it's not going to be too dismal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stagnant Pattern 
</P>
<P>
This stagnant pattern of light rains will not change much until early next 
week, when a heavy storm headed this way from Hawaii is expected to hit, 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures today through Sunday are expected to range from 55 to 60 degrees. 
Nighttime lows for the coastal strip will be 47 to 50. Inland, nightly 
temperatures will drop to 40 to 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains will have highs of 35 to 40 degrees, with lows of 25 to 30. The 
northern cold air has lowered the snow level to 5,000 to 6,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Deserts are expecting highs in the 60s, with lows in the high 30s and low 40s. 
</P>
<P>
The surf will be 2 to 4 feet, with water temperature at 54 degrees.

CITY INSTITUTES DRUG TEST POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tough new drug and alcohol policy will be used to discipline and fire city 
employees who engage in substance abuse on the job, San Diego city officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, which takes effect today, a worker will be required to 
undergo a "compulsory" drug and alcohol test when a supervisor has "reasonable 
suspicion" that the employee is abusing either substance. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ferrier, the city's labor relations manager, insisted that the 
compulsory tests will be voluntary. "But, if they refuse to take the test, it 
will be treated as insubordination, and we will take disciplinary action," 
Ferrier said. 
</P>
<P>
The written policy states that it is not the city's intention "of intruding 
into the private lives of its employees," but the plan also calls for 
disciplinary action to be taken against employees who drink after work while 
wearing a city worker's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for unions that represent some of the city's estimated 8,000 
employees could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White-Collar Workers 
</P>
<P>
Safety personnel such as police officers, firefighters and blue-collar workers 
are prohibited from drinking alcohol at work or during lunch breaks. However, 
the rules are not as stringent for some white-collar employees, who were told 
in the 14-page written policy that they are "strongly discouraged" from 
drinking during lunch breaks and not at all at work. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also has a nine-step procedure for urine testing, which does not give 
employees the option of taking blood or breath tests. City employees who are 
ordered to take urine tests will do so while being observed by "medical 
assistants" under contract to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the policy deals with a supervisor's 
"reasonable suspicion," which will be enough to trigger an investigation of an 
employee suspected of drug use. The policy does not require employees to be 
caught in the act before they take a drug test. Instead, the policy says that 
reasonable suspicion could be raised solely on "reliable information" that may 
be given to a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The policy does not say whether employees accused of drug abuse will be allowed 
to question their accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"Supervisors will be trained to recognize individuals under the influence of 
alcohol or controlled substances," read the policy. They will be taught to be 
on the lookout for symptoms that suggest drug or alcohol abuse such as "watery 
eyes, unsteady gait and inattention to personal hygiene." 
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the policy calls for disciplinary action to be taken against 
employees who fail to inform their supervisors that they are taking medication 
-- whether it be a prescription or over-the-counter medicine -- that might 
impair their ability to do a job safely. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy also calls for mandatory drug tests for any employee involved in 
an accident while operating a city-owned vehicle or power equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who have substance-abuse problems are also encouraged to seek 
voluntary treatment through the city's Employee Assistance Program.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: THINGS LOOKING UP ON THE MID-PRICE DOWNTOWN LUNCH 
SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, you can eat lunch in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crush of moderate and medium-price eateries that have come along to 
supplement the business district's formal restaurants and fast-food feederies 
is a storefront-size establishment on Broadway that claims to serve the largest 
sandwiches in town. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph's, an animated bar-delicatessen-restaurant situated mid-block between 
7th and 8th avenues, does in fact pile on the corned beef, hot pastrami, turkey 
breast, liverwurst and egg salad until the mere sight of one of these massive 
sandwiches dissolves any plans you may have made for the evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Faint of Appetite 
</P>
<P>
Salads also are heaped, rather than composed, in bowls that look to be at least 
2 quarts in capacity -- the house specialty combines diced turkey, corned beef 
and cheeses with tomatoes, olives and egg on greens. But, even on the more 
demure side, the single-item salads consist of beds of lettuce nearly hidden 
beneath layerings of albacore, broiled chicken breast or sliced turkey. This is 
not, in other words, a place for the faint of appetite. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant offers a lively, noisy scene for an informal lunch, and provides 
the bonus of seating at the bar, which may be the only seating available for 
guests who arrive between noon and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a seat at the bar does not imply the obligation to drink, although the 
food certainly arrives slowly enough to allow a leisurely pre-meal nip. Much 
noise has been made in recent national and Southern California food articles 
about the return of the martini, a phenomenon that does not seem to have 
surfaced here yet. In any case, the martini can be a challenge one would rather 
defer; what is true at Joseph's is that the bartender makes a fine Manhattan, 
that old-fashioned cousin to the martini that requires whiskey, sweet vermouth, 
a dash of bitters and, like it or not, a maraschino cherry. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch can be a bit slow in arriving, but does make a statement when it finally 
shows up. One of the few semiformal entrees, a roasted half-chicken, was 
neither more nor less than what was expected, a fairly meaty bird cooked to the 
juicy stage (it was in fact rare near the bones), seasoned with a modest 
American hand and garnished with a few plainly cooked vegetables. This was 
simple but substantial and satisfactory fare, and it seemed quite a bargain at 
$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
The sandwiches, priced mostly at $4.95 for single-item fillings and a dollar 
higher for triple-decker combos (turkey, salami, Swiss cheese, cole slaw and 
Russian dressing is a typical example) also seem major bargains when the sheer 
volume of food they offer is factored in. 
</P>
<P>
But there are instances in which the quantity versus quality issue comes to the 
fore, as in a groaningly large hot pastrami sandwich that featured 
unappetizingly fatty meat. Both corned beef and pastrami need to be trimmed 
before slicing, a step with which Joseph's mistakenly dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
The menu at Downtown Johnny Brown's in the Community Concourse is considerably 
narrower than at Joseph's, but is its equal in terms of price and portion 
sizes. This casual but comfortable burger saloon puts out a hefty lunch and 
features the added option of outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Brown's restricts itself to cooking on the mesquite grill, which may 
sound a little tedious, although the range of choices is sufficiently broad. 
The three main choices are hamburgers, grilled chicken breasts and the fish of 
the day, with variations on these themes as well as simple salads, chili with 
onions and cheese and a soup of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The format is a cross between fast food and full service, because guests place 
orders at a cash register and retrieve their food on trays. The cooking is done 
to order, however, and the place also offers full bar service; the selection of 
beers includes quite a number of lesser-known foreign labels. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditure of an extra 70 cents will allow one to elaborate the basic 
$4.25 hamburger into the extravagantly all-American bacon cheeseburger, a 
recherche combination that goes down quite easily. Johnny Brown's uses a good 
grade of beef, cooks it up juicy and sandwiches it inside toasted buns of some 
quality; the garnish includes a heap of freshly made french fries and the usual 
onion, lettuce and tomato. It's basic, but it's good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Grill Man 
</P>
<P>
The same comment can be made about the grilled chicken breast, which also can 
be had smothered with cheese and slid inside a bun. The mesquite grilling gives 
the meat a good flavor, and the grill man seems to know the exact moment at 
which the meat is at its juicy best. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter's new 515 Fifth, which offers a relatively elaborate style 
of cooking, fits comfortably into the medium-price category when guests 
approach lunch as a bowl of soup paired with an appetizer, because most of 
these tend to be substantial. Given that meals include baskets of the excellent 
home-baked bread, it is possible to leave this restaurant full and happy for 
less than $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The standing menu offers five appetizers and "small plates," as it likes to 
call them, and this list is supplemented by three or four daily specials. 
Regular features include a "panache," or delicate arrangement, of smoked salmon 
and Scandinavian-style dill-cured salmon, decorated with golden caviar and 
grilled focaccia bread; eggplant cannelloni, or sheets of eggplant wrapped 
around a shrimp and salmon mousse, and a salad of romaine and radicchio 
decorated with scallops of chicken, strips of prosciutto and rounds of creamy 
goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clever Corn Chowder 
</P>
<P>
The soup recently was a clever corn chowder that followed the genuine chowder 
format: The corn was added sparingly, and the creamy broth included cubed 
potatoes, snippets of Ortega chilies, sliced mushrooms and celery. It was a 
remarkably elegant soup, with the caveat that it seemed to include not a speck 
of salt; those multitudes who restrict their sodium intake would not have been 
disappointed by this, but the soup was flat. 
</P>
<P>
A sauce that seemed much like the soup (it was a touch thicker, and included 
salt and a more generous supply of corn) dressed a beautifully arranged plate 
of Anaheim chili peppers stuffed with tiny, sweet rock shrimp. Cilantro brought 
a decided perkiness to the plate, which was reasonably filling and seemed 
fairly priced at $5. Other special appetizer choices that day were 
country-style rabbit pate with a salad of tomato and red onion, and broiled 
Kunamoto oysters, arranged over a watercress salad and topped with smoked 
salmon and golden caviar. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen put one of those usually unlovable calamari steaks to good use by 
coating it with sesame seeds, giving it a quick saute in hot butter and 
arranging the sliced result over a handsome salad of fine pasta, enoki 
mushrooms, Belgian endive, snow peas and shredded red bell pepper. This was of 
course colorful, but, much more important, it offered an unusual and quite 
satisfying combination of flavors. This extravagant presentation cost $5.75. 
</P>
<P>
Indulgence in the pastry tray may lift this place beyond the realm of an 
everyday-price lunch, but the six or seven choices are quite difficult to 
resist. Recent winners among the homemade beauties were a pistachio-strawberry 
tart (possibly the only one of its kind in the county) and a light cheesecake 
sweetened with honey and flavored with fresh blueberries.

EMBATTLED KENNEL OWNER BACK IN JAIL AFTER FAILING TO SURRENDER ASSAULT RIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruby Mae Brown, the embattled owner of Kelly's Pet Hotel, was jailed once again 
Thursday for failing to turn her assault rifle over to police. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was to have turned the weapon over to police by 10:30 a.m., but did not. 
Instead, she appeared in the courtroom of Superior Court Judge E. Mac Amos Jr., 
apparently intending to tell the judge she had sold the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't receive a hearing before the judge, so she left the courthouse and 
headed for the Mission Hills office of her attorney, Fred Corbin. Police 
followed, and Brown was stopped on the street, handcuffed and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded With Judge 
</P>
<P>
When she was brought into court later in the day, Brown said she had sold the 
AR-15 assault rifle Wednesday night to a woman named Tammy Sutton, whom she met 
on Thorn Street, and only wanted to give the judge the receipt to prove she no 
longer had the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Fritz Ortlieb said police had told him that Sutton's reported 
address on Main Street did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, weeping, pleaded with the judge to set her free for two hours to go get 
the gun, but Amos refused. The judge set bail at $10,000, and scheduled a 
review hearing for this morning to see if Sutton's identity or the whereabouts 
of the gun could be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 61, is set to go to trial Tuesday on 283 criminal counts ranging from 
animal abuse to failure to keep a sanitary kennel. She is also embroiled in 
administrative proceedings with the county Department of Animal Control, which 
is attempting to revoke her kennel license. 
</P>
<P>
In court last week for the county hearing, Brown said, "If they take my 
license, I will kill." She also said she had purchased an assault rifle two 
days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
During a court appearance Monday for a postponement of the criminal trial, Amos 
ordered Brown to turn over the weapon. When she refused, she was taken into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was released from the Las Colinas women's jail Wednesday morning, on the 
condition that she turn the gun over to police within 24 hours. Brown said her 
attorney told her that presenting proof of a sale would suffice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Give Advice 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Corbin, however, said he did not give Brown any such advice. "She did 
talk to me about it, and I never told her to take a receipt or to sell it to 
anybody," Corbin said Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told her not to carry the gun down to the court because somebody might 
suspect she was going to hurt somebody, and she might get shot doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Corbin said he did advise Brown to go to the judge and ask him how she should 
arrange for the surrender of the gun. "I suggested she could turn it over to 
me, or they could send the marshals down to get it from her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown did not want to turn the gun over to the police because she figured they 
would keep it, Corbin said. "Apparently, (the police) came in several times to 
the kennel, according to her, for the purpose of accompanying the 
animal-control people for inspections, and they seized her weapons and she 
never got them back."

REPORT BY STATE; 
</P>
<P>
83% REPEAT AS OFFENDERS AFTER LEAVING VISIONQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 83% of San Diego County juvenile delinquents sentenced to the VisionQuest 
wilderness camp have been arrested again since their release from the 
Arizona-based private reform program, a new state report says. 
</P>
<P>
County probation officials said they were "not surprised" by the findings, 
which they said were similar to those in earlier reviews of VisionQuest and 
publicly operated probation and prison programs. 
</P>
<P>
VisionQuest officials, meanwhile, described the report as "very positive" 
because it showed relatively lower rates of repeat convictions and it noted 
that, on average, youths were arrested less often after they left VisionQuest 
than they were before they entered the program. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared for the Legislature by the state auditor general, is the 
latest in a series of studies on VisionQuest, a for-profit detention program 
criticized in the past for its practice of using physical confrontation to 
bring recalcitrant youths into line. VisionQuest and county probation officers 
have battled for years over the relative effectiveness of private and public 
probation programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
462 Youths' Cases Studied 
</P>
<P>
The report studied the cases of 462 California youths who were sent to 
VisionQuest by judges statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The auditors found that 143 youths, or 31%, were arrested at least once within 
six months after their release from VisionQuest, and 45 youths, or about 10%, 
were sent to state prison or the California Youth Authority for their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the first 213 San Diego youths sent to VisionQuest, 66, or 31%, were 
arrested within six months after leaving the program. A total of 176 youths, or 
83%, were arrested within three years of their release from the program. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report did not compare the VisionQuest numbers to those at the 
county's publicly run probation camp system, it cited an earlier study by the 
RAND Corp., which found that 71% of youths sentenced to county camps eventually 
commit another crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Positive Report' 
</P>
<P>
A VisionQuest spokesman noted that nearly 70% of San Diego participants avoided 
going to prison or to the California Youth Authority after their release from 
VisionQuest. And statewide, youths who averaged two arrests per year before 
going to VisionQuest were arrested an average of less than once per year after 
completing the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a very positive report," said VisionQuest spokesman Mike 
Cracovaner. "Our goals have always been to keep kids from being reincarcerated 
and to teach kids respect for themselves and others. Things like the dramatic 
reduction in reincarceration rates and the reduction in violent crime rates 
encourage us that we're headed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
J. Douglas Willingham, the county's deputy chief probation officer, said the 
numbers were "very close" to what the county has found in its own studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see these results as being startlingly different from the program we 
run ourselves or what the state runs for that type of kid," he said. "It's not 
any different from our earlier numbers."

San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen and Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer are 
expected to officiate at an 11 a.m. dedication today of the new Northeastern 
Station, said Bill Robinson, department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-square-foot building at 13396 Salmon River Road in Rancho Penasquitos 
is heated by solar water power, and will house 200 officers and support 
personnel, Robinson said. The officers will serve the residents of Scripps 
Ranch, Mira Mesa, Miramar, Rancho Penasquitos and Rancho Bernardo. The officers 
have been working in a temporary building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The building also has staff exercise rooms and a public meeting room. Another 
building will house facilities for light vehicle maintenance, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.1-million station, which has a Spanish motif, is the fourth the Police 
Department has opened in the last four years, said Robinson.

A 30-year-old Navy man apparently shot and wounded his 22-year-old wife during 
an argument early Thursday and then killed himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis J. Johnson Jr. apparently shot his wife, Billette Rene Johnson, once in 
the chest as they argued just after midnight in the 5200 block of Orange Avenue 
in East San Diego. Johnson then walked out on the front lawn and shot himself 
once in the head with his .30-30 rifle. He was dead at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Billette Johnson told police she called for help from a neighbor's house. She 
was taken to Mercy Hospital, where she was in good condition Thursday, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. The couple's two children were temporarily placed at 
the Hillcrest Receiving Home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a Navy petty officer first class stationed in Long Beach, said 
Chief Petty Officer Craig Huebler, spokesman for the Commander Naval Base 
office in downtown San Diego.

LESBIAN SAILOR GUILTY IN WOMAN'S SLAYING

<P>
After deliberating for less than three hours, a Superior Court jury on Thursday 
convicted a lesbian sailor of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of 
another Navy woman last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Sherral Lyn Clayton, 24, of Lemon Grove, showed little reaction to the verdict. 
San Diego Superior Court Judge Carlos Cazares set sentencing for March 6. 
Clayton could receive a sentence of 25 years to life in state prison for the 
Oct. 7 slaying of Shelly Dupee, 21, of Spring Valley.

During closing arguments Thursday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell said the 
crime was premeditated and urged jurors to convict Clayton of first-degree 
murder. Chappell said the victim was stabbed 54 times and her throat was 
slashed. 
</P>
<P>
But Clayton's attorney, Elliot Lande, argued that his client should be 
acquitted based on her testimony that she stabbed Dupee in self-defense after 
Dupee suddenly attacked her in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two women erupted over a third woman -- Debbie 
Picklesimer -- whom both had dated, according to testimony. Clayton testified 
that, just before waving a knife, Dupee had declared, "You're not going to take 
Debbie away from me." 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, Lande said, "It is clear that Shelly Dupee was a very 
jealous woman. It is clear that she was mean-spirited." 
</P>
<P>
In rebuttal, Chappell said: "She killed the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton received several cuts on her hand during the struggle and was in a 
hospital receiving stitches when she was arrested.

WOMAN TRIES TO GET BACK CONDO LOST IN FEE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the cold nights when she has to sleep in the front seat of her Datsun 280Z, 
Alyce Vrba often thinks back to her condominium in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old businesswoman lived for 10 years at Ridgegate, a guarded 
complex of 350 units, four pools and two tennis courts that sprawls across 35 
acres near the summit of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
From the time she arrived in 1978, Vrba said, she used her training as an 
interior designer to make over her home: A walk-in closet became an Art Deco 
bar. An entire bedroom wall was painted with a Rousseau jungle scene. Five 
Burmese cats added warmth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my own little fortress, in a way," Vrba said. "There was a feeling of 
security." 
</P>
<P>
That was before Vrba stopped paying her maintenance dues to the Ridgegate 
Homeowners Assn. Vrba said that in 1987, she began withholding fees of about 
$165 a month because, she said, the maintenance firm hired by the association 
wasn't caring for common areas near her unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condominium Sold 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half later, she has been evicted. Her home, which is worth about 
$300,000, has been sold by the Ridgegate Homeowners Assn. to pay $1,900 in 
maintenance fees that the association said she owed. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba's lawyer, Francis Pizzulli, said foreclosure was an extreme remedy for a 
$1,900 bill. "It's amazing," Pizzulli said. "You hear these stories about 
homeless people, and you think it's drugs or alcohol. But something like this 
is kind of shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Vrba, who said she has been living with friends and sometimes in her car, has 
filed two lawsuits seeking to recover her property. Both are pending in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, although several preliminary rulings have gone against 
Vrba. On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe removed legal attachments 
that had prevented the buyer of her condominium from selling it. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba's complaints center on what she said was the homeowner association's 
failure to warn her that she could lose her home. A day before her condo was 
sold, Vrba's lawsuits claim, she was assured that the sale would be postponed 
to let her pay the overdue balance. If she had been properly warned, Vrba said, 
she never would have let her maintenance fees lapse. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for the new owner of the unit said all residents at Ridgegate, and 
most other condominiums in California, should realize that they lose their 
homes if they do not pay their dues. Vrba received several notices that she had 
to pay, according to affidavits signed by the new owners of her unit. 
Condominium associations have few other options to get members to comply with 
the rules, said Jerry Rappaport, a lawyer for the buyers of the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she and her husband discovered Ridgegate in 1978. He was a 
transportation planner, and she was an interior designer. The couple had lived 
in Los Feliz and moved to Ridgegate with the expectation of eventually owning a 
house on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Then she suffered two serious car accidents, Vrba said, which put a strain on 
the marriage. It ended in divorce in 1983. Vrba said she received the 
condominium in a settlement with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was very important to me," she said recently. "It was the only thing 
that remained stable through all that." 
</P>
<P>
She said she gave up her work as a designer and began her own business 
consulting firm, advising other companies how to reorganize. Despite having a 
master's degree in business administration from USC, Vrba said, she sometimes 
found it hard to find enough clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintenance Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, she paid her bills until a dispute with the Ridgegate 
Homeowners Assn. over maintenance around her unit. Vrba said gardening went 
unfinished, a door was not varnished and the roof leaked. By July, 1987, Vrba 
said, she was fed up and began withholding her fees, which are used by the 
condominium association to keep up common areas. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Bali Management declined to comment on the maintenance 
question or the foreclosure, and the company's lawyer, who also represents the 
association, did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
To collect overdue fees, Bali Management Inc. of Torrance, the property 
manager, placed a lien on Vrba's condominium. 
</P>
<P>
All owners at Ridgegate, and many other condominium complexes, sign contracts 
that permit foreclosure on their property if they fail to pay dues. State law 
permits that these foreclosures, unlike most, may be conducted outside the 
supervision of a court. In such nonjudicial foreclosures, owners do not have 
one important right that they have in other foreclosures: the right to pay the 
sales price themselves to buy back their properties. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Condominium Trustee Service of Hermosa Beach notified the 
county that the firm had been authorized to sell the property to collect on 
Vrba's overdue account. Milton Katz, president of the business, said this week 
that Vrba also received a notice by certified mail. He said the firm has proof 
that the letter was delivered, but Vrba denies signing any receipt. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is one of several that the homeowners association, management 
company and Katz said they sent to Vrba. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notice on Door 
</P>
<P>
She said she received no warning and knew nothing of a foreclosure until last 
March 9, when she returned home to find a notice tacked to her door: A 
trustee's auction of her condominium would be held March 31. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled: "I looked at it and I said, 'This is unbelievable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she made repeated phone calls to Bali Management and Katz in an 
attempt to stop the sale. On March 30, Vrba said, Katz assured her that the 
sale would be postponed and that she would have time to work out her 
differences with the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
The property was auctioned the next day. Real estate investors Peter Baer and 
I. W. Abramson bought the property for $13,200 and assumed the mortgage, which 
has a balance of about $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
Katz denied that he spoke to Vrba on March 30 or any other time. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed with one of her lawsuits, Vrba claims that the sale was 
fraudulent because it brought a price so far below the unit's market value of 
$280,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners have said it is unfair to judge the sale solely on the auction 
price. Abramson said in a sworn statement that the partners had to make $32,000 
in overdue payments. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9,000 in past property taxes must still be paid, as well as about 
$140,000 still owed on the mortgage, said Abramson and his lawyer, Rappaport. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she was not late on her mortgage payments and that the buyers had 
grossly overstated their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her legal challenges, a South Bay Municipal Court judge agreed to a 
request to evict Vrba from her condominium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out of Money 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she was soon out of money and couldn't work because her home had also 
been her office. She stayed with friends for a time, but they soon grew tired 
of her continual legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't like to have you around when you have problems," Vrba said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she recently received food stamps and general assistance of $200 from 
the county. Vrba's said her struggle to regain the condominium has worn her 
down. She drinks lots of coffee and calls frequently to a telephone a message 
service that has become her best link to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba declined to have her picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
"You are literally thrown into the street," she said. "It gets to your pride." 
</P>
<P>
She brought her complaints to the state Department of Insurance and attorney 
general's office and to the county district attorney's office. But all three 
agencies told her that the dispute is a civil matter. 
</P>
<P>
Several attorneys who have represented Vrba said her problems are magnified 
because she does not have money to properly investigate her claims. She has 
been left to act as her own investigator, and at times, as her own lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she will press on, but concedes: "I am consumed by it. There is no 
question about it."

FELANDO ANNOUNCES HE HAS CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO

<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) disclosed Thursday that he 
is undergoing radiation therapy to treat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another battle, and that's what I do best. I'll fight it," declared 
Felando, whose reputation as a savvy political street fighter was bolstered 
last year when he defeated a well-financed Republican primary challenge and 
coasted to reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times, Felando said he plans to remain in the 
Legislature and to run for reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, 54, who has not been in the Capitol this week, said that he began 
receiving radiation treatment Tuesday for mycosis fungoides, a form of lymphoma 
that affects the skin and occasionally spreads to the internal organs. He said 
the cancer is similar to leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospects Reasonably Good 
</P>
<P>
Felando said the treatment could cause excessive fatigue, weight loss and 
increased metabolism. He said his doctors have told him that after he completes 
the 10-week treatment program, the prospects for normal life expectancy are 
reasonably good. 
</P>
<P>
A cancer specialist at UCLA who asked not to be identified said Thursday that 
if the disease is detected early, "it's something that can be cured or 
repressed for long periods of time." 
</P>
<P>
While undergoing treatment, Felando said, he will continue to oversee his staff 
in Sacramento and at his Torrance office. Felando said he plans to spend part 
of each week in the Capitol to attend hearings and Assembly floor sessions. 
"I'll do that as long as I can," Felando said. "If this fatigue thing is worse 
than I imagine, then I'll cut back." 
</P>
<P>
Another South Bay lawmaker, Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), was 
discovered last year to have a liver lymphoma. He died in October. During 1988, 
at least three other Assembly members were under treatment for various types of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Political Profile 
</P>
<P>
Felando, first elected in 1978, has had a high political profile since the end 
of 1987. First he announced that he would run for the congressional seat held 
by then-Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) after Lungren was nominated as 
state treasurer. But Felando later withdrew from the contest, citing the 
potential strain on his family life. 
</P>
<P>
When he jumped back into the race for his Assembly seat, Felando faced a 
challenge from Deane Dana III, son of Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana. 
The younger Dana accused Felando of having a cozy relationship with the 
Assembly's top Democrat, Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco. Felando 
defeated Dana by an 8% margin and went on to win the November general election 
in the 51st District, which stretches from Hermosa Beach to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature reconvened a month later, Felando again found himself on 
the political hot seat. Republican legislators and party officials sought to 
pressure him into supporting Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), who was 
challenging Brown's speakership. Felando, however, announced that he would not 
support any Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embarrassment for Republicans 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and two other Republicans believed to be sympathetic to Brown cast 
their votes for Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, a move 
designed to embarrass those Republicans who ultimately supported Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Felando, a dentist, was privately seeking a diagnosis for his 
symptoms. He said he first spotted lesions on his skin about 18 months ago. 
However, he said, the cancer was not diagnosed until last September or October. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker said the toughest part of having the malignancy has been telling 
his family. "I'm handling it pretty well mentally, but when you tell people you 
really love, they become extremely emotional, and that becomes even harder on 
me."

HOPE TO RUN IF NEW DISTRICT MATERIALIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Hope said Thursday that he plans to seek the Republican nomination for 
Congress again in 1992 if, as he expects, a new district is created in the West 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully expect to do that," said Hope, a Harvard-educated attorney and the son 
of entertainer Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, 48, has raised his political profile with his recent nomination to the 
state Republican Central Committee by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley). His confirmation is expected when the party convenes Feb. 18 for its 
next convention. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Hope had sought the GOP nomination for the 21st District seat vacated 
by then-Rep. Bobbie Fiedler but was upset by Mayor Elton Gallegly, then the 
mayor of Simi Valley. Nevertheless, Hope proved a prolific fund-raiser. His 
financial supporters included former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. 
Nixon and many prominent members of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, reached in Washington, D.C., Thursday, said he would not challenge 
Gallegly, with whom he has consulted periodically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Care Job 
</P>
<P>
Hope is a senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha, where he is responsible for 
long-range planning for health-care issues. He said he divides his time between 
the firm's Washington and Los Angeles offices. His wife, Judy, is a trial 
attorney with the Los Angeles law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to a report in Thursday's editions of The Times, Hope has been 
registered as a Republican to vote in North Hollywood since July 21, 1987, and 
has a California driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before announcing his candidacy in 1986, Hope had moved to a Northridge 
home after a 10-year absence from California -- prompting Gallegly to brand him 
a carpetbagger. He subsequently sold that house. 
</P>
<P>
Hope said he has remained active in California political and civic affairs 
since his inaugural bid for public office, giving speeches to Republican groups 
and participating in the California Bar Assn. He is also chairman of the board 
of Mount Vernon College in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He readily acknowledged that defeat did not diminish his desire to go to 
Congress -- if the opportunity presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
The state's 45 congressional districts will be redrawn by the Legislature and 
governor after the 1990 election. California is projected to gain about five 
additional seats as a result of its increased population, with the majority in 
fast-growing Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Though the redistricting will not begin until the 1990 Census is completed, 
Hope outlined a scenario that he said could make his candidacy a reality. It 
calls for pushing Gallegly's 21st District -- which includes Republican-leaning 
parts of the Los Angeles communities of Northridge, Canoga Park, Granada Hills 
and Woodland Hills -- entirely into Ventura County, which has grown 
substantially in the past decade, Hope said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, a new district "will get created in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen, however, whether the Democrats will allow a 
Republican-dominated district to be established in the Valley, especially if 
they win control of the governorship as well as both houses of the Legislature 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Their first priority is likely to be protecting veteran Reps. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Tarzana) and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who represent 
most of the West and East Valleys, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The more conservative Valley portion of Beilenson's 23rd District is more than 
offset by the 40% of the district on the staunchly liberal Westside. Beilenson 
was reelected to a seventh term last November with 63% of the vote.

L.A. ASKED TO HALT 3 STORES' LIQUOR SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima neighborhood group has asked a Los Angeles zoning board to consider 
canceling permits that allow liquor to be sold at three businesses that police 
say are havens for drunks, drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The request will be heard at a public hearing before a city zoning 
administrator Feb. 10. It concerns Leon's Liquor and Junior Market, in the 
10900 block of Glenoaks Boulevard; John's Liquor, in the 13100 block of Van 
Nuys Boulevard; and Pacoima Food Market, in the 13000 block of Van Nuys 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was prompted by complaints from the Hansen Hills Neighborhood Assn. 
and police, said Greg Jackson, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes the area. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition sent to Bernardi's office, the association charged that the 
stores have sold liquor to minors and that constant loitering and gang and drug 
activity have occurred near them, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Arrests Made 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Wayne Woolway of the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that several 
arrests have been made at or near the stores for these and other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Woolway said the stores' owners have not worked with police to curtail criminal 
activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Farah Ammari, owner of Pacoima Food Market, said he has tried to discourage 
such activity outside his store. Ammari said he spent $70,000 to install more 
lights and to erect a 10-foot wrought-iron fence around his parking lot to keep 
out drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"What else can I do? I can't control the streets," Ammari said. "That is the 
job of Darryl Gates, not me." 
</P>
<P>
Ammari admitted that he sold liquor to minors a couple of times in the past. 
"That is no big deal," he said. "Every store has done it. It is no reason to 
destroy a business." 
</P>
<P>
Ammari, who has operated his store for 15 years, said some customers have 
offered to speak on his behalf at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
John Chung, owner of John's Liquor, said he believes his store has been 
unfairly singled out. "It's just the city picking on me because of the 
pressure" from the association, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be bad around here, but now it is clean," Chung said, adding that 
he had installed more lights outside his store to discourage loiterers. 
"There's no drug dealing in front of my store. It's quiet and clean."

PARKS AGENCY GETS TIME TO BID ON FORMER AGOURA FAIR PARCEL 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors postponed a decision Thursday on a 
plan to develop the former Renaissance Pleasure Faire site in Agoura, which 
gives a state parks agency time to make an offer for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Brian Heller's proposal to build 159 houses where the county general 
plan allows 103 houses has been controversial partly because of efforts by the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
Heller has been unwilling to sell the property. But parks officials have said 
that approval of the 159 houses would increase the site's development value and 
put it out of the conservancy's reach -- should the developer change his mind 
or should the land be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' delay to March 2 will allow the conservancy time to finish an 
appraisal of the 320-acre site, said Joseph T. Edmiston, conservancy executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy could make Heller an offer for the property if its appraised 
value is within what the agency can afford, Edmiston said. He would not 
elaborate on how much the conservancy might be willing to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a chance," Edmiston said. "There will be enough time to make 
communication with the landowner." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, moved for the continuance 
Thursday at the request of Supervisor Deane Dana, who could not attend the 
meeting. Dana's office was flooded with calls in recent days from citizens on 
both sides of the dispute who had learned that Dana and Supervisor Peter F. 
Schabarum would be absent, said Don Knabe, Dana's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Dana nor Schabarum has said how he will vote on the issue. But at a 
Jan. 12 board meeting, Schabarum said he was skeptical about whether the 
conservancy is serious about buying the property. And Dana said at the earlier 
meeting that the conservancy deserved more time to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Heller has characterized the conservancy's efforts to acquire the land as an 
11th-hour attempt to stop his development.

WEEKENDER: FOOD, FIREWORKS AND A LION DANCE WILL USHER IN THE CHINESE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about the hats and noisemakers and those vintage Guy Lombardo tunes. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay is about to find out how the Chinese ring in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is just about the same, "the end of the old, a new start," said John 
A. Bottorff, the owner of a Chinese restaurant at Golden Cove Center in Rancho 
Palos Verdes and an old China hand who spent 24 years working for the U.S. 
government in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But the celebration has its differences, Bottorff says. The Chinese like 
several days of revelry and a variety of games, and a gaudy and noisy lion 
dance that symbolizes the good luck everyone hopes the new year will bring. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this colorful slice of folk art is expected to be the high point of the 
free Chinese Lunar New Year Festival unfolding Sunday at Golden Cove for six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Created by dancers from the Immortals Gung-Fu Lion Dancing Troupe, the beast 
will dance and prance around what is normally the center's parking lot, which 
will be transformed into festival grounds by colorful booths for food, arts and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The lion's approach is heralded by "outbursts of firecrackers, beating drums, 
resounding gongs and crashing cymbals," said Jeff Chan, director of the 
Immortals group. All of this noise drives away evil sprits, allowing the lion 
to bring luck -- "an unbeatable combination for anyone, but especially for the 
Chinese," said Chan. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is the undisputed star of the festival, the lion won't be the only 
performer there. Others will demonstrate Asian martial arts, Chinese brush 
painting and Tai Chi Chuan, a discipline that combines physical conditioning 
and mental concentration. Chinese folk dance and choral music will also be part 
of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The first-ever community Chinese New Year festival in the South Bay, according 
to its organizers, the event is a way of recognizing that the Chinese, and 
other Asians as well, are becoming a significant part of the South Bay 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very large Chinese community in Palos Verdes and in the surrounding 
area," said Bottorff. "Palos Verdes in many ways is a multicultural microcosm 
of the whole Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
Joining in staging the festival are the city of Rancho Palos Verdes and a 
variety of Chinese community associations, including the South Bay Chinese 
Culture Assn. and the South Bay Chinese School of Language and Culture, and 
several South Bay civic and arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
James Liao of Rancho Palos Verdes, chairman of the culture association, said 
his group estimates that there are 4,000 Chinese-American and immigrant Chinese 
families in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
He called the Sunday festival a "good chance for people to be together," 
adding: "Lunar New Year is more than a Chinese tradition. It is shared by 
Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, almost every Asian ethnic group. . . . It is 
like Thanksgiving, a blessing for a bountiful year, and it ushers in the new 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Chang of Rancho Palos Verdes said he wants "the festival to become an 
annual thing." He and his wife, May, are founders of another group helping to 
sponsor the festival, the Evergreen Seniors Assn. It was organized five years 
ago to help elderly Chinese, especially new arrivals who don't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
The city is providing booths for the celebration and will also sponsor a kite 
festival at the nearby Point Vicente Interpretive Center. "We'll help people 
put kites together and have a kite hospital in case they wreck their kites," 
said Phyllis Butts, a city recreation aide. 
</P>
<P>
Though the festival marks Chinese New Year and features Asian fare, Italian and 
American food will also be available. Several local artists will have booths. 
Free shuttle transportation will be provided to the festival from nearby 
parking lots at City Hall, the Interpretive Center and St. Paul's Lutheran 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
The date of Chinese New Year varies annually because it is based on phases of 
the moon. Each year is identified with one of 12 animals, creatures that help 
Chinese shamen attain heavenly enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
The Year of the Dragon, whose characteristics are passion and health, is about 
to give way to the Year of the Snake, a sign of wisdom and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
But what festival organizers want on Sunday is a day of fun. Said Henry Chang: 
"We want to make it as great as possible with a large Chinese turnout." 
</P>
<P>
What: Chinese Lunar New Year Festival. 
</P>
<P>
When: Sunday, Feb. 5, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Golden Cove Center, Hawthorne Boulevard and Palos Verdes Drive West, 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Admission: Free.

<P>
LEGAL ADVICE BUDGET INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Due to a substantial increase in lawsuits, including several police brutality 
suits, the Torrance City Council unanimously approved spending $25,000 more for 
legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
The additional money, approved Tuesday night, will go to the law firm of 
Leibert, Cassidy &amp; Frierson, which advises the city on personnel matters, 
particularly matters involving the police. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in nine months that the city has increased the amount 
of fees it will pay the firm. In November, 1987, the city signed a $10,000 
contract with Leibert, Cassidy &amp; Frierson to provide legal advice. In May, 
1988, those funds were spent and the city appropriated an additional $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the additional funds granted this week are 
needed to pay for legal advice on an increasing number of suits, including nine 
police brutality lawsuits filed against the city this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when the city's first-quarter fiscal report was released, city 
officials expressed concern over the fiscal impact of police-related lawsuits, 
saying legal fees will be high, as some of the cases are expected to be in 
court for several years.

Aman was killed when he drove off the Foothill Freeway and plunged onto Van 
Nuys Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, the California Highway Patrol reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old La Canada man, whose name was not released pending notification 
of his family, was killed at 8:20 p.m. Wednesday when his eastbound car drifted 
to the right shoulder of the freeway, hit a guard rail and became airborne 
before landing on the boulevard below, officials said. 
</P>

COASTCAST PLANT CITED FOR RELEASING ODORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys company has been cited for creating a public nuisance by releasing 
foul odors, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, said 
that the citation comes after complaints by people who live in a trailer park 
next door to the Coastcast plant in the 16700 block of Stagg Street. 
</P>
<P>
The residents contacted the AQMD on Jan. 19, complaining about sickening odors 
emanating from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The company could be fined a maximum of $25,000 for the citation, which will be 
added to a Jan. 24 citation against the company for visible smoke, officials 
said. That citation also could cost the firm a maximum of $25,000, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the AQMD will continue its investigation into what caused the odors. 
But he said investigators believe they came from wax burned in a wax-cast 
process Coastcast uses to manufacture metal parts for the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has been cooperative, and they have shut down the oven that was 
creating the odors until they can work out with our engineers how to solve the 
problem," Kelly said.

MAN GETS 12 YEARS IN KNIFE ATTACK ON WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills man was sentenced to 12 years in prison Wednesday for a knife 
attack on his wife that left her disabled and brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Robert Rodin, 38, pleaded guilty in December to assault with a deadly 
weapon in the Thanksgiving, 1987, stabbing attack on his wife, Palma Mirabella, 
33. 
</P>
<P>
After an argument over Rodin's use of heroin and cocaine, Rodin stabbed 
Mirabella with a kitchen knife, slashing her carotid artery and severing her 
jugular vein, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca Dewees. Shortly after the attack, 
Rodin summoned paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabella is now confined to a wheelchair, having suffered permanent nerve 
damage, Dewees said. Doctors have said that she will not regain the ability to 
walk and must be under a live-in nurse's care, Dewees said. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabella urged Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber to impose the 
maximum term on Rodin. She told the judge that Rodin's attack had left her 
unable to care for herself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's ruined my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodin claimed that Mirabella came toward him with an ashtray and that he 
"blocked her assault," by raising his hand, according to a probation report. He 
said that he was holding a wineglass in his hand and that the stem broke and 
hit Mirabella in the throat, the probation report said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodin, who was on parole for armed robbery at the time of the stabbing, will be 
eligible for parole again in 6 years.

XSCRIBE POSTS 4TH STRAIGHT LOSS; CO-FOUNDER DEPARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xscribe Corp. on Thursday announced its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and 
said its co-founder and board chairman, Robert F. Mawhinney, is no longer an 
employee of the company. Mawhinney, who will remain as Xscribe's chairman, was 
dismissed as chief executive Jan. 2 but remained on the payroll until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Xscribe's loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 was $3.3 million on sales of 
$7.1 million, contrasted with a profit of $138,000 on revenue of $7.5 million 
over the corresponding three months the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was attributed by the company, a manufacturer of computer-aided 
transcription (CAT) devices for court reporters and paralegals, to continuing 
delays in getting its Magnum series of products on the market. Delays in 
introducing updated versions of Xscribe's previous generation of CAT machines 
were also blamed for the red ink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Work Force 
</P>
<P>
The delays, which have stretched out more than one year, have cut sharply into 
Xscribe's sales and earnings and prompted the company to cut its work force by 
27% recently. After 94 layoffs over the last two months, Xscribe's work force 
now totals 250. 
</P>
<P>
Xscribe plans to make more, unspecified job cuts in coming months through 
attrition, chief financial officer Donald Quackenbush said Thursday. "We are 
looking for completion (of the Magnum line) in the near term, but I can't be 
specific" as to when, Quackenbush said. 
</P>
<P>
Xscribe, which has lost nearly $6 million over the last four quarters, posted a 
loss of $5.1 million on revenue of $22.2 million for the nine months ended Dec. 
31, contrasted with a profit of $1.3 million on revenue of $24.5 million over 
the first three quarters of the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$12.2 Million Equity 
</P>
<P>
Despite the string of losses, Xscribe's shareholder equity is still 
substantial, at $12.2 million. The company has $658,000 in cash and cash 
equivalents on hand, in addition to an available bank line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Xscribe announced that Suren G. Dutia was replacing Mawhinney as 
chief executive. Xscribe's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding, 
Mawhinney co-founded the company in 1978. His brother-in-law, Thomas Delahanty, 
resigned Aug. 30 as Xscribe president and chief operating officer.

BANKERS TELL BUSH THEY CANNOT KICK IN MORE TO BAIL OUT S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the thrift and banking industries, fearful of higher costs, told 
President Bush on Thursday that their business cannot afford to contribute any 
additional funds to help bail out failing savings and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
The healthy S&amp;Ls are not to blame for the crisis, and it is not fair to ask 
them "to shoulder any further burden," said Theo Pitt, chairman of a special 
federal insurance committee of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers likewise insisted that banks are not responsible for the failure of 
hundreds of S&amp;Ls. C. G. Holthus, president of the American Bankers Assn., 
said he told Bush of "our grave concern that the solution should not impose 
costs on commercial banks and their customers." 
</P>
<P>
Executives from the S&amp;L and banking industries met at the White House with 
Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Budget Director Richard G. Darman 
and other Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and the other officials listened intently and asked questions, industry 
officials said. But they did not provide any hints of the final form of the 
S&amp;L bailout plan they will soon present to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing the Administration is to raise huge sums of money -- 
Congress' General Accounting Office on Thursday pegged the figure at $85 
billion -- to liquidate or sell insolvent S&amp;Ls and rebuild the federal 
insurance fund that guarantees deposits up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is thought to be leaning toward a bond issue that would 
raise the cash. The annual interest cost would range as high as $9 billion a 
year, and the Administration and Congress would have to divide the burden 
between financial institutions and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy S&amp;Ls are already contributing a significant share of their profits 
to the federal insurance fund. S&amp;Ls pay $2.08 a year for every $1,000 they 
hold in deposits, contrasted with the 83 cents per $1,000 that banks pay. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders told Bush that any additional increase could threaten to drive 
some S&amp;Ls into insolvency at a time when they badly need more capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about the need to attract capital to the business and to improve the 
position of already healthy and marginally solvent institutions," said Pitt, 
immediate past chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions and 
president of the Pioneer Savings Bank of Rocky Mount, N.C. Fred Webber, 
president of the league, also attended the White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The bankers said the financially crippled S&amp;Ls -- there are about 350 
nationally -- should be promptly liquidated or merged. And they want their 
S&amp;L competitors to meet the stricter rules that federal regulators now 
apply to banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I urged that the capital, accounting and regulatory standards of the savings 
and loan industry be brought quickly to the rigorous levels of the banking 
industry," said Holthus, president of First National Bank of York, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office recommended to the Senate Banking 
Committee that federal regulators seize control of insolvent S&amp;Ls to 
prevent them from offering above-market interest rates in competition with 
healthy S&amp;Ls for investors' funds. 
</P>
<P>
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, the GAO's director, said the ailing 
S&amp;Ls should be placed under government control and then quickly liquidated 
or sold to minimize the eventual cost of restoring the federal insurance fund. 
The "sense of urgency is very important," Bowsher said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) said the 
committee will move quickly on a package of legislation that combines a 
financial solution to the crisis with some major changes in regulation and 
supervision for the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a combined package, not a new infusion of money without controls," 
said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the committee's top-ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle said he also wants to pursue the billions of dollars that disappeared 
from S&amp;Ls into bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Where did all the money go?" Riegle asked. "A lot of people got rich. The 
money just didn't vanish into thin air." The committee will question Justice 
Department officials next week about the pursuit of former S&amp;L executives 
who may have profited from illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), praising last year's transaction in which the 
Robert M. Bass Group bought American Savings &amp; Loan of Stockton, said it 
should not be lumped together with the flurry of year-end sales in which 
federal regulators found buyers for 75 crippled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The Bass group will operate a "good bank" with the sound loans from American 
Savings and a "bad bank" to manage the thrift's money-losing investments. This 
arrangement, Cranston said, should help reduce the ultimate cost to the the 
insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Caution S&amp;Ls 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hourlong meeting at the White House, Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu told the financial industry participants that he was irritated by 
"irresponsible" advertisements by banks in Texas, Arkansas and Kansas 
encouraging S&amp;L depositors to shift their savings. "We are going to call 
the banks and inform them of the concern in Washington and the sensitivity that 
they might not be aware of," said Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the 
American Bankers Assn. "We made a promise to the Administration that we would 
certainly monitor it, and we agreed with their concern." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the President did not respond 
directly to any of the points raised at the meeting by bank and S&amp;L 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the House Banking Committee released a GAO report that said 
accounting firms "did not adequately audit and . . . report" the financial 
condition of some S&amp;Ls that later failed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the nation's leading accounting firms were "derelict in their 
responsibility to sound early alarms," committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.) and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), chairman of the financial 
institutions subcommittee, said in a written statement.

OSHA FINDS SAFETY VIOLATIONS AT SECRET LOCKHEED FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. officials have found worker safety and training violations at Lockheed 
Corp. after investigating the aerospace giant's top-secret Burbank plant and 
two other facilities in Southern California, federal officials and Lockheed 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The violations could result in Lockheed being formally cited by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is conducting the ongoing 
investigation. Depending on the seriousness of the violations, the citations 
could mean thousands of dollars in fines against Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gravitt, head of OSHA's Los Angeles office, said the agency should decide 
within two weeks whether to issue the citations. Either way, "we would in any 
case expect corrective action" by Lockheed, Gravitt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remedies Promised 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed vowed to fix the problems. "We have been and are committed to 
providing a hazard-free workplace for all employees," Kenneth Cannestra, 
president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems, the division that operates the 
plants, said in a bulletin to Lockheed employees. 
</P>
<P>
Gravitt declined to say exactly what violations had occurred and how often. 
Lockheed officials likewise would not elaborate, but Cannestra's statement said 
that during a meeting Tuesday between Lockheed and OSHA officials, OSHA 
"indicated Lockheed would be cited" for the violations. 
</P>
<P>
The citations would "focus on housekeeping, record-keeping and the reporting to 
OSHA of employee illnesses or injuries," Cannestra said. "Others deal with 
health and safety training, use by employees of protective clothing and 
equipment, and communication of information about hazards." 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank plant, dubbed the "Skunk Works," is where Lockheed reportedly is 
building a stealth jet fighter designed to evade enemy radar. The Air Force 
last November confirmed that Lockheed was developing the plane, called the 
F-117A, in California but gave no additional details. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lockheed's aircraft production is centered at the Burbank plant, and 
Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said OSHA investigators "devoted most of their 
attention" to that facility. The other plants investigated by OSHA are in 
Palmdale and Rye Canyon. The three plants employ 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA began investigating the plants last fall after dozens of Lockheed workers 
asserted that they were getting ill from handling hazardous "composites" and 
other materials used in building aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Composites are strong, lightweight, plastic-like materials that are 
increasingly used in aircraft construction. They are essential to stealth-type 
planes because they do not reflect radar waves as readily as metals, making the 
planes harder to detect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Corroborates Clients' 
</P>
<P>
About 75 Lockheed workers have sued Lockheed, and about 150 have filed workers' 
compensation claims, contending that they suffer from skin rashes, headaches, 
memory loss and cancer because of handling the materials. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lawyers for the workers, Timothy Larson in Encino, said the OSHA 
findings "corroborate what my clients have been saying about the environment 
they've been working in." 
</P>
<P>
Some Lockheed employees have argued that their work was so secret that they 
were afraid to report health problems to their doctors for fear of violating 
laws regarding classified information. They had also complained that the 
Burbank plant was not properly inspected because Lockheed turned away OSHA 
inspectors who did not have necessary security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, John C. Brizendine, who preceded Cannestra as head of Lockheed 
Aeronautical Systems, said in an employee bulletin that Lockheed had "seen 
nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally unsafe or pose 
a health hazard, providing proper procedures are followed." 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale said Thursday that, based on OSHA's summary of Lockheed's violations, 
"we would continue to say that's a correct statement." 
</P>
<P>
If Lockheed is cited, OSHA could determine that the violations range from minor 
safety problems to willful violations that are punishable with fines of up to 
$10,000 per violation, Gravitt said.

COMPTON FAMILY CLAIMED ACTIONS RUINED FURNITURE BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
UNION BANK AGREES TO SETTLE LENDER-LIABILITY LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Union Bank has agreed to settle a lawsuit involving claims by a Compton family 
that California's fifth-largest bank ruined the family's 
furniture-manufacturing business, an attorney for the family and court records 
disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to settle the lender-liability case was reached Wednesday, just 
before a Los Angeles Superior Court jury was scheduled to consider awarding 
punitive damages to the family. 
</P>
<P>
The jury already had decided the case in favor of Contempo Metal Furniture and 
the family of the late Louis Schuster, owners of the defunct company. Last 
Friday, the jury awarded compensatory damages of $12.5 million to the business 
and various family members. Schuster died last November. 
</P>
<P>
Compensatory damages are designed to cover actual losses. In the second phase 
of the trial, the jury was to consider punitive damages, which are supposed to 
serve as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
The family was seeking an additional $20 million in punitive damages. But 
lawyers for the bank and family reached an agreement to settle out of court 
before that phase of the trial started. 
</P>
<P>
A. Barry Cappello, a Santa Barbara attorney who represented the Schusters, 
refused to disclose how much money the family will receive. He said the bank 
asked that the settlement terms be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients are delighted with the settlement," said Cappello, a pioneer in 
the growing lender-liability field in which borrowers are suing banks when they 
believe that the lenders contributed to their financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Union Bank said, "We think it is a good settlement." 
</P>
<P>
The events that led to the lawsuits occurred before Los Angeles-based Union 
Bank was acquired last year by California First Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from the closing of Contempo Metal Furniture in Compton in 
1985. The bank contended in a lawsuit that the Schusters had mismanaged the 
company and caused its failure. The family filed a countersuit charging that 
the bank had forced them to hire two outside consultants who were responsible 
for the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The family's suit said the bank failed to disclose that one of the consultants 
was a personal friend of the bank loan officer on the account and that the bank 
misrepresented the qualifications of the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants, William M. Leider and Jerald C. Murphy, were named in the 
family's countersuit but they settled their portion of the case two days after 
the trial began in late December. 
</P>
<P>
Steven E. Young, the attorney for the consultants, said their settlement did 
not contain any admission of wrongdoing and they did not pay any money to the 
Schusters. "They have categorically denied any wrongoing, but they could not 
afford to continue to defend this case," said Young, who added that settlement 
talks had begun before the start of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Contempo was founded in the early 1960s by Louis 
and Edythe Schuster. It was a profitable, family-run business until 1979, when 
a recession in the industry led to its first loss. The losses continued into 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Schuster, who had been running the company for his father, introduced a 
new line of furniture in mid-1982, which he felt guaranteed a return to 
profitability. He sought a $200,000 line of credit to finance the manufacture 
of the new line from Union Bank, where the company had banked for years. 
</P>
<P>
The family's lawsuit said a bank loan officer, James Goswiller, said the loan 
would not be approved unless outside consultants were hired and recommended the 
new investment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Goswiller, now a senior vice president at the bank, suggested 
hiring Leider and Murphy without disclosing that he was a personal friend of 
Leider's. The suit also said bank officials inflated the qualifications of the 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, the consultants took control of the company, received 
stock in Contempo and excluded the Schusters from the decision making process, 
the family's suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's debt to Union Bank rose to $3.2 million, and Contempo was closed 
in late 1985 after Union Bank foreclosed on the loans and sold the company's 
assets at auction.

A broad measure of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 23, 
the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose 
to a seasonally adjusted $3,072.6 billion in the week, from $3,070.4 billion 
the previous week. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a 
seasonally adjusted $785.8 billion from a revised $783.6 billion. M1 includes 
cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers 
checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money market mutual

A U.S. District Court judge has dissolved a temporary restraining order that 
prevented Genetics Institute, a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotechnology firm, from 
manufacturing and selling an anti-anemia drug it is developing. The judge urged 
a speedy trial in the matter. Genetics Institute is involved in a series of 
patent infringement cases with Amgen, a Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology 
company that is developing its own version of erythropoietin. Amgen and 
Genetics Institute have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for 
approval to sell the drug here, and both, through partners, are trying to break 
into the European market.

SMITHKLINE MAY SPIN OFF 3 UNITS IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SmithKline Beckman Corp., which stunned Wall Street last week when its 
president abruptly resigned, is considering spinning off its profitable 
health-care units, including two in Orange County and one in Van Nuys, Chairman 
Henry Wendt said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a commitment to unlock the value of our health-care businesses for the 
benefit of shareholders," Wendt told reporters after a meeting with securities 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to unlock and unbundle the potential value of these units by 
making them more separate and more visible," Wendt told the analysts. He said 
the moves must be "managed and controlled carefully and with discipline" but 
provided no further details on the plans. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline stock closed down $1 a share Thursday at $51.625 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Wendt targeted the company's Irvine-based Allergan Inc. eye-care division and 
its SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratory network of testing laboratories, as well 
as Beckman Instruments in Fullerton, for a partial sale. The Beckman subsidiary 
was partially spun off last year to a generally cool reception from Wall 
Street. SmithKline, based in Philadelphia, sold 17% of Beckman to the public 
and hinted at other spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan makes eye-care and skin-care products and employs 2,700 people in 
Southern California, according to the company. Sales rose 37% last year to $756 
million. A company spokesman reiterated Thursday that Allergan has not been 
told whether part or all of the company will be sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, which makes medical instruments, employs 3,500 in Southern California. 
Sales were $770 million last year, up 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Bio-Science is headquartered outside Philadelphia but employs 1,500 and 
operates a big laboratory in Van Nuys. The unit had sales of $675 million last 
year, up 57%. 
</P>
<P>
Wendt said he "shouldered the blame" for the drop in U.S. drug sales and 
acknowledged that SmithKline has not yet solved its strategic problem of 
excessive dependency on its anti-ulcer drug Tagamet. SmithKline, the nation's 
eighth-largest drug company, has been striving to restore investor confidence 
because of declining sales of Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tagamet sales, which account for half of SmithKline's total drug 
sales, dropped to $1.02 billion from $1.13 billion in 1987. In the United 
States, Tagamet sales fell 24.4% to $499 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been a persistently rumored takeover target since it first 
announced a drop in Tagamet sales last June. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President George Ebright resigned over differences regarding the 
direction of the company, and some analysts said Ebright balked at Wendt's 
plans to give greater autonomy to the company's individual divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Paine Webber analyst Ron Nordmann said after Thursday's meeting that 
"management has held its plan for the future close to the vest" but added that 
investors should be reasonably reassured that the company's business is 
basically solid. 
</P>
<P>
But Neil Sweig, of Prudential-Bache, said the meeting held no surprises and 
added: "Fundamentally the company in 1989 is weak and the stock will be 
significantly weakened."

Ducommun Inc. expects to report a fourth-quarter loss and is negotiating with 
its bank, Security Pacific, to change an agreement that says Ducommun's 
fourth-quarter net loss cannot exceed $600,000. Ducommun, a Carson-based 
aerospace and electronics firm, said its fourth-quarter loss from operations 
would be less than the $1.6 million it lost in the third quarter but that it 
would be taking a $1.5-million writedown for excess inventory at its Jay-El 
unit and a $2-million charge for cost overruns at its AHF-Ducommun unit.

BUYOUT FIRMS SLASH R&amp;D SPENDING, SURVEY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Companies involved in restructuring or leveraged buyouts cut back on research 
and development in 1987 while most other companies increased their spending, 
according to the National Science Foundation's annual survey of industrial 
R&amp;D. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the companies reduced their research and development staffs, according to 
the report, which was released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report may give added ammunition to critics who question the long-term 
competitiveness of companies involved in mergers, LBOs and other corporate 
restructurings. The report comes at a time Congress is considering legislation 
that would discourage LBOs, which are takeovers financed by debt to be repaid 
from the target company's future earnings or from selling off assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Both federal and industrial research support are important pillars for our 
nation's economic competitiveness," Erich Bloch, NSF director, said in a 
statement. "Any factor that causes reductions in research weakens our 
industries' ability to compete internationally," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The NSF said its survey looked at 200 companies that together account for 
almost 90% of U.S. industrial research and development spending. Sixteen 
companies were identified as having recently been involved in a merger. Eight 
others were involved in leveraged buyouts, stock buybacks or major 
restructurings to avoid becoming targets of takeovers. Those eight companies 
reduced R&amp;D spending 12.8% between 1986 and 1987, the NSF said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Industries Affected 
</P>
<P>
The 24 companies together reduced R&amp;D spending 5.3% for the same period, 
while the other companies in the group of 200 reported a 5.4% increase, the NSF 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation said mergers, acquisitions and other restructurings had a 
dampening effect on the R&amp;D performance of various industries. Six of the 
16 companies that had merged were in the transportation industry, the NSF said, 
adding that those companies reduced R&amp;D spending 5.5%. In the chemicals 
industry (including pharmaceuticals), companies affected by mergers, 
acquisitions or other restructurings reduced R&amp;D spending 4.5%. In 
contrast, the report said the rest of the industry reported a 9.8% increase in 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers, however, questioned whether the survey's results should 
necessarily be viewed negatively without knowing more about the companies 
surveyed. William G. Ouchi, a professor of management at UCLA's Anderson 
Graduate School of Management, said the transportation companies cited -- 
presumably including the recent airline mergers -- may have found duplicated 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some "companies may not have been very efficiently managed. It could have 
been that their research labs had a lot of people doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The NSF report "bears some research" on which companies were studied, said 
Douglas K. Le Bon, a vice president at Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica and 
consultant to pension funds investing in LBOs. "Just because B follows A 
doesn't mean A causes B," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that are subjects of LBOs tend to be in mature industries such as 
retailing and food processing, with relatively low R&amp;D expenditures to 
begin with, he said. Lenders and investors want companies with stable cash 
flows and earnings that will be best positioned to repay large debts incurred 
in the deals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Le Bon added that firms acquired through LBOs will also tend to sell off units 
involved in heavy R&amp;D spending, since those units are most likely to have 
the least stable cash flows and earnings. That could account for any decline in 
R&amp;D spending at those firms. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look for pieces to divest, you divest pieces that are susceptible to 
technology swings, since those companies have greater risks," Le Bon said.

The stock market retreated further Thursday as some investors took profits from 
the recent rally and others held back from buying ahead of the January jobs 
report due out today. The Dow Jones industrial index ended down 4.46 points at 
2,333.75, extending its modest 4.11-point loss on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. Big Board volume came to 183.43 million 
shares, down from 215.64 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very benign decline," said Jon Groveman, head trader at Ladenburg 
Thalmann. "People are lightening their positions ahead of the employment 
report." 
</P>
<P>
The report is viewed as a good gauge of the economy's strength and therefore 
provides a clue as to whether the Federal Reserve will feel pressured to nudge 
rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically at a standstill while we wait for the numbers," said trader Ken 
Ducey of S. G. Warburg. Economists expect that 291,000 jobs were created last 
month, up from 279,000 in December, and that the jobless rate remained 
unchanged at 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substantial Rally 
</P>
<P>
"Basically you're seeing people nervously taking profits after the explosion we 
had last week and early this week," said James McCarthy, a technical analyst 
with Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the six sessions leading to Wednesday, the Dow index tacked on more than 100 
points in a rally helped by firm U.S. Treasury bond prices and a rising dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The mild profit taking of the past two days is "probably healthy for the market 
from a technical standpoint and could establish a new zone of support that 
would take the market higher over the intermediate term," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts agree that the market's tone looks good. "The short-term trend is 
definitely up," said Groveman of Ladenburg Thalmann. "Sentiment is definitely 
starting to change." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are uncommitted are looking for an entry point," said Michael Metz 
of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Some high-technology stocks were strong, continuing to benefit from recent 
earnings reports that exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks closed higher in active trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 
225-share index, which fell 220.62 points Wednesday, gained 137.62 to close at 
31,498.30. Share prices also rose on the London Stock Exchange after the 
market's already bullish mood was boosted by the government's approval of the 
$5-billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed 3.7 points higher at 2,043.4.

DEFICIT IMPERILS STANDARD OF LIVING, GREENSPAN SAYS

The budget deficit is eating away at the foundations of the nation's economic 
strength and threatens the future living standard of Americans, Federal Reserve 
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundation of our economic 
strength," and the need to reduce the deficit has become ever more urgent, 
Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not underestimate the difficult decisions that you must make if we are to 
achieve the necessary reduction in the deficit," he said. "But allowing 
deficits to persist courts a dangerous corrosion of our economy and risks 
potentially significant reductions over time in our standard of living." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Americans' savings were absorbed by the combined federal, 
state and local government deficits in the 1980s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, higher interest rates associated with increased Treasury 
borrowing have reduced private investment, which is essential to building 
factories and modernizing other parts of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign investment has helped offset the effect of a low U.S. savings 
rate of about 3% of disposable income, Greenspan cautioned that "looking ahead, 
the continuation of inflows of foreign savings at current levels is 
questionable." 
</P>
<P>
The gap between the government's spending and its receipts came to $155.1 
billion in the year ended Sept. 30 and is expected to hit $161.5 billion this 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he does not favor a tax increase and that legislators should 
strive to reduce the deficit to the fiscal 1990 target of $100 billion through 
spending cuts.

AT THE GALLERIES: SHARP EDGES OF THE TEXAS BORDER IN DOWNTOWN EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard truths beget hard surfaces in the work of James Drake. A monochrome 
toughness, empowered by sharp edges and the blunt force of fact, pervade his 
installation at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's downtown gallery (838 
G St., through April 9). 
</P>
<P>
Drake lives in El Paso, Tex., on the cusp of Mexico. Like San Diego, El Paso 
has a teeming neighbor across the border, and, for 22 years, Drake has watched 
the tug-of-war played out between American authorities and the citizens of 
Juarez, over how and where the line between their two worlds should be drawn. A 
"Tortilla Curtain" of fencing there and the proposed drainage ditch here are 
among the most amusing and superficial solutions. Nevertheless, the game 
continues, the rules never quite keeping pace with the needs of the players. 
</P>
<P>
What Drake does through his art is remind us, starkly and often poignantly, of 
the human toll of such belabored, desperate, insufficient efforts to satisfy 
those needs. His installation, "Juarez/El Paso," the centerpiece of the La 
Jolla show, focuses on the 1987 deaths by suffocation of 18 aliens attempting 
to cross the border near El Paso in an airtight refrigerator boxcar. Drake's 
work pays homage to the lost lives in a tone shifting from elegy to anger, 
irony to anguish. 
</P>
<P>
Each component of the installation combines a large charcoal drawing with 
adjacent objects or text. One drawing depicts the infamous boxcar, a dark 
haunting icon of tragedy. Isolated on its track, the car is surrounded only by 
smudged streaks of charcoal, the ghostlike handprints of the victims clawing in 
vain for freedom. On the floor beneath the drawing stands a pile of coal-black 
stones, a funeral mound embedded with a crowbar like that apparently tossed 
into the boxcar by the smuggler before sealing its doors. 
</P>
<P>
In another drawing, a plume of dense, black smoke rises from a heap of rubble 
on the floor -- shoes, dented cans, broken bottles, a doll, tools, shards of 
pottery, all blackened as if charred by fire. Like the lives wasted in the 
boxcar incident, these objects, once useful and nourishing, have been 
abandoned, sacrificed, made detritus in an ugly reversal of the alchemical 
process. 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive, taunting tableau occupies the wall between these two drawings. 
At its center, a welded steel figure of a female nude, generalized and without 
a head, prances on a semi-circular platform. This stage protrudes from a large 
charcoal drawing showing the railway tracks stopping abruptly at a tall, black 
barrier. This is the end of the line, and the woman, like the two black steel 
swans on the floor at her sides, seems to symbolize the uneasy mix of death and 
beauty, promise and defeat that greets those who cross the threshold to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
Two archways against this wall symbolize this concept more explicitly. By 
nature of their open form, they invite through passage, but at the same time 
they repel prospective entrants with a threatening array of military weapons or 
a daunting display of knives and tools. These cancel the open invitation of the 
arches and render passage through them a life-or-death proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Illegal," a recent work related to the "Juarez/El Paso" installation, 
pairs a poem written by one of the victims of the boxcar incident with a 
drawing suggesting the interior of his collective tomb. "How beautiful is the 
United States/Illinois, California, and Tennessee," the poem reads. "But over 
in my country/A piece of the sky belongs to me./Goodby, Laredo, Weslaco, San 
Antonio./Houston and Dallas are in my song./Goodby, El Paso, I am back 
Chamizal./Your friend the illegal has returned." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the poet's fate, his anticipation of returning to his homeland, where 
he can at least claim a piece of the sky, reads with tragic irony. In Drake's 
drawing of the mismatched shoes and garments strewn on the floor of the empty 
boxcar, the loss of life is again suggested obliquely. Rather than dwelling on 
the obvious violence of the situation, Drake focuses on its residue, on the 
peripheral traces of death, and this makes the work all the more disturbing and 
absorbing. 
</P>
<P>
The two other assemblages in the show, "Knife Table" and "Machine Gun Bench," 
are harsh assaults on the violence of contemporary life and leisure, but the 
crude and heavy-handed manner of their realization deprives them of a more 
enduring power. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Juarez/El Paso" work, Drake encourages the viewer to grasp in personal 
terms the dilemmas of those crossing the border. Their current options, he 
implies, are all, literally, dead ends. By presenting only symptoms of the 
situation and his own poetic visions of it, Drake challenges the viewer to 
shape his own interpretation and, in the best tradition of socially concerned 
art, to transform that response into resolved and committed action.

TOM SELLECK AND COMPANY COULD USE A STRONGER 'ALIBI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mysteries are supposed to lull before they startle; it's part of the plan. 
Certainly the credits of "Her Alibi" (citywide) lull us into thinking that, 
like them, the movie will be witty, sophisticated and elegant. It is certainly 
elegant looking, but 15 minutes into the action the thrill is gone and director 
Bruce Beresford seems to have no clue as to how to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Those nifty credits are the jacket illustrations of prolific mystery writer 
Philip Blackwood (Tom Selleck), who has hit a writing block and can't churn out 
any more steamy adventures for his hero, Peter Swift. In desperation, he hits a 
few real courtrooms, looking for inspiration. For a while it seems as though 
the film's screenwriter, Charlie Peters, is on a charming tack, bringing on a 
quartet of old courtroom regulars who greet Selleck as one of them, cluing him 
in to the juicier cases in the building. However, the four remain 
underdeveloped, like so many other nice touches in the story. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom is just a ploy to let Selleck meet Nina Ionescu (Czech-born 
actress-model Paulina Porizkova), a "Romanian" mystery woman. Before you can 
say "jurisprudence" Selleck has lied gracefully, providing Porizkova with an 
alibi at her murder trial, and detective James Farentino has swallowed the 
obvious lie, allowing this ludicrous plot to inch its way forward. You'd expect 
more from students in Screenwriting 1A classes. 
</P>
<P>
It's all to get our two stars under one roof, Selleck's country house, probably 
one of the most ruggedly seductive retreats around. It should be: The 
production designer is Henry Bumstead, who's done everything from "Vertigo" to 
"To Kill a Mockingbird" and from "The Sting" to "The Little Drummer Girl." But 
then producer Keith Barish has assembled a world-class technical slate: 
England's great Freddie Francis ("The French Lieutenant's Woman," "Dune") was 
the cinematographer; France's Anne Goursaud ("One From the Heart," "Ironweed") 
was the editor; Wayne Fitzgerald designed the titles; the music is by Georges 
Delerue ("Jules and Jim," "Silkwood"), and the splendid Ann Roth ("Klute," "Day 
of the Locust," "Working Girl") did the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
And all this loving talent is in the service of this loosely crocheted 
screenplay, studded with tired little ribaldries and action that finds shooting 
a man in the hip with an arrow hilarious. The waste is enough to make you keen 
piercingly in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
The film's fun is supposed to come from the contrast between Selleck's macho 
Peter Swift dialogue and his own klutzy behavior. He's twitterpated by the very 
sight of Porizkova who may or may not be a real murderess. Do audiences really 
want to see Tom Selleck -- the closest thing we have to Clark Gable -- lurching 
about like Chevy Chase; hurled onto his car with his face smooshed up against 
the windshield and the wipers on? Nice that he can take himself so lightly; 
pity that he has to. 
</P>
<P>
Porizkova, who was delicately ingenuous in "Anna," gives exactly the same 
reading here. To many it may not even matter. She can also be found riding 
bareback, bounding on a trampoline or slipping into a bath towel -- simply 
watching her in motion is a jaw-dropping sight. Her lifelong complicity with 
cameras has relaxed her utterly; put her in front of one and she moves her 
long, long legs and arms with a floppy doll languor that's enchanting. But 
after quite a lot of this, even the most undemanding fan may want a bit more: a 
characterization perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
It's as useless to hope for as the possibility that director Beresford will 
rouse himself from his torpor and get this movie going somewhere. From the way 
characters pop onscreen unexpectedly, especially Selleck's family and friends 
in the last third of the film, there's a hint that crucial scenes may have 
vanished, but it takes a faith stronger than mine to think they would have 
helped much.

CLARK, PACIFIC SYMPHONY MUSTER FAKE BEETHOVEN, REAL BRAHMS

Every once in a while, some not-so-good Samaritan comes along and puts a head 
on the "Winged Victory" or provides the missing limbs for the Venus de Milo or 
completes Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Gimmickry invariably looms with each such effort. So does inevitable failure. 
Nevertheless, the fleeting PR value carries its own irresistible reward. 
</P>
<P>
This season's most modish mock-revelation has been billed as Beethoven's 10th 
Symphony. Actually, it is nothing of the kind -- just a little orchestral essay 
in the late-Beethoven manner "realized," rather clumsily and dutifully, from 
assorted quasi-authentic sketches by a Scottish musicologist named Barry 
Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic ventured the much-ballyhooed and 
little-appreciated premiere last October. This was followed by disappointing 
but well-publicized performances in London and New York, not to mention a 
breathlessly hyped recording. 
</P>
<P>
The unreasonable facsimile offered by the Pacific Symphony under Keith Clark 
Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was heralded as the 
West Coast premiere. Actually, that dubious honor had already fallen to San 
Jose, which heard the ersatz symphony back in November. 
</P>
<P>
Premiere or no premiere, the so-called 10th is a cautious and inconsequential 
exercise in musical guesswork. It meanders prettily and naively for a while in 
lyrical circles, then pops off for the obligatory contrast of some dramatic 
naivete before returning meekly to andante basics. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the piece sounds like Beethoven salvaged from the cutting-room floor. 
Much of it sounds like the throat-clearing of a dull Beethoven imitator who is 
forced to vamp until ready. At 16 minutes, this is a short piece but a long 
vamp. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and his charges gave it a ragged introductory reading. Significantly, 
perhaps, the audience couldn't muster enough enthusiasm to recall the music 
director for a single bow. 
</P>
<P>
Matters improved in the major challenge of the evening, Brahms' First Piano 
Concerto. The odd acoustical ambiance of Segerstrom Hall reduced much of the 
rhetoric to mush. The orchestral impulses threatened to get flabby whenever 
agitation beckoned. Internal intonation was often questionable. Still, the 
spirit was willing and, most important, Horacio Gutierrez illuminated the solo 
utterances with urgency, fluidity and rhapsodic grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece on the program took the unaccustomed form of Joseph 
Schwantner's "New Morning for the World," a setting of speeches by Martin 
Luther King, Jr. First performed in Rochester six years ago -- with none other 
than Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates as narrator -- it allows the 
orchestra to vacillate between movie-music slush and instant bombast while the 
soloist recites some poignant historical texts. 
</P>
<P>
The intentions are obviously lofty. Unfortunately, Schwantner did little but 
crank out prosaic busy-music to surround the uplifting prose. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, William Warfield spoke the uplifting prose with clarity and 
emotional point. The affect was intensified by understatement but compromised 
by microphone echoes. 
</P>
<P>
Clark exhorted the orchestra to make a mighty accompanying noise. The noise, 
not incidentally, sounded blurry and distorted beyond the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the specter of amplification clouded aesthetic and musical issues 
in Orange County.

An item in Thursday's Morning Report prompted a number of cable television 
subscribers to call the Los Angeles City Department of Telecommunications 
asking about deposits they have made on channel changers and converter boxes. 
Cable companies are automatically required to return deposits with interest at 
the time service is disconnected, says Susan Herman, general manager of the 
department. She says that two Los Angeles area cable companies currently hold 
deposits: American Cable Systems, which serves Hollywood, Wilshire, Westchester 
and South-Central Los Angeles, and Cablevision, which took over Valley Cable 
and maintains deposits collected by that company. ALEENE MacMINN

The Ensemble Studio Theatre, beset by financial difficulties, will leave its 
East Hollywood home at the end of February. Vicki Williams, a spokeswoman for 
the theater, says the group can no longer afford the "more than $3,000 in rent 
and other costs" and is looking for a new theater. The news follows the 
premature closing Sunday of "West Memphis Mojo" at the Ensemble, the result of 
a dispute between the Ensemble and the show's producers, Larry Riley and Carmen 
Hayward-Stetson, over the running costs of the production. ALEENE MacMINN

THE VIETNAM WAR SEEN THROUGH VIET CONG EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Iron Triangle" (Westside Pavilion) is an entirely decent effort to view 
the Vietnam War through the eyes of a young Viet Cong guerrilla as well as 
those of a veteran American captain. For all its sincerity and despite the 
effectiveness of newcomer Liem Whatley and Beau Bridges, it is a grueling and 
tedious business, not that much different from any routine and bloody B war 
picture. Somehow, too, the notion that the enemy can be a guy not so different 
from us comes as scarcely an astounding revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from an actual Viet Cong soldier's diary by director Eric Weston and 
co-writers John Bushelman and Larry Hilbrand, the film takes its title from a 
region northwest of Saigon at the base of the Ho Chi Minh infiltration route 
where the highest number of enemy troops was concentrated. Although only 17, Ho 
(Whatley) is a seasoned and resourceful soldier, idealistic and dedicated yet 
not reveling in bloodshed, an attitude that riles a zealous, thick-headed 
Communist Party official (James Ishida). Bridges is a capable leader, patriotic 
without being consumed by hatred for the enemy. At one point Bridges' Capt. 
Keene spares Ho's life. What is Ho to do now that he has captured Keene? 
Unfortunately, the question proves not to be as trenchant or suspenseful as one 
would wish. 
</P>
<P>
Complementing Whatley and Bridges' solid performances are those of Johnny 
Hallyday as a cynical French mercenary and veteran of Dien Ben Phu and Haing 
Ngor as Ho's level-headed commander, a man not unlike Keene. "The Iron 
Triangle" (rated R for standard war movie violence), which was filmed in Sri 
Lanka, is high-minded but not nearly distinctive enough to be involving.KEVIN

Sex and death both have juicy histories in art. Even plague, the Black Death of 
the 14th Century, found its way into paintings of the early Renaissance. But 
AIDS, sometimes perceived with a mixture of horror, distaste and denial, is a 
subject seldom seen in the confines of a gallery.

"Against Nature: A Group Show of Work by Homosexual Men," a brave and 
remarkably strong show at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (to Feb. 12), is 
by turns salacious, factual, ironic, shallow and sorrowful. The passion behind 
the work is, of course, never in doubt; even the most debauched imagery is 
undercut by a sense of doom. But the level of aesthetic control is also 
surprisingly high. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are scenes of copulating bodies cut from magazines on the 
borders of the frames Arch Connelly covers with campy gold-dotted veiling and 
faux pearl clusters. There are scatalogical ceramic sculptures by John de Fazio 
that cannot be described in this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
But there are also more complex kinds of shock effects. 
</P>
<P>
Nayland Blake titles a pair of framed linen handkerchiefs spotted with dried 
blood "After Veronica," drawing a poignant parallel between an AIDS patient's 
vital fluids and those of the female plague-sufferer healed by Christ's touch. 
</P>
<P>
As if producing window displays for a chi-chi jewelry store, Bruno Cuomo seals 
pretty little red or white shapes -- actually drops of HIV-positive blood and 
semen -- within paperweights arranged among decorative rocks in hollowed-out 
tree limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tidmus' "Health and Morality: A Desultory Discourse," is a computer 
program that spits out a terse, coolly discursive condemnation of the 
Reagan-Bush Administration and the religious right for their evasions and 
spurious allegations in the face of the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mike Glass' trio of modishly moody photographs of a young man -- the 
remnants of an afternoon of dashed expectations, a would-be seduction the 
accompanying text describes in voluptuous detail -- viscerally convey the fatal 
attraction of risky sex. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 14 visual artists (the exhibit also includes a booklet of writings 
and a group of videos), Doug Ischar's massive wall installation, "Household 
Misappropriation: Camouflage So Good One Is Shot at by Other Hunters," has 
perhaps the most subversive program. 
</P>
<P>
In large Type-C color photographs, we watch a man going about his life: washing 
dishes, taking a bath, packing copies of True Men magazine in a box. (Is he 
moving? Might these be the belongings of a dead lover?) Below, "found" images 
massed like post cards on a bulletin board offer scenes of Boy Scouts and 
members of the armed forces engaged in comradely activities in close proximity 
to each other, sometimes semi-nude. 
</P>
<P>
Considered along with accompanying fragments from gay novels and other sources 
-- a book on adolescent development, a description of heterosexual conquest 
from Flaubert's "L'Education Sentimentale" -- the point of this piece is 
disturbingly clear. The meanings assigned to images of men or of lust have 
everything to do with the contexts in which we find them and our own states of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
For this viewer, at least, it was something of a revelation to see how valuable 
the contemporary-art legerdemain with texts and images can be in trying to deal 
in an honest but disciplined way with issues of sexual preference and the 
enormity of a highly selective modern plague.

Anyone familiar with lithography knows the name Clinton Adams. Recognized 
artist, UCLA prof by the late '40s, Clinton also co-inspired -- along with June 
Wayne -- the now famous Tamarind Lithography Workshop, seedbed for the '70s 
print revival in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a limited retrospective (the size and number of works underscores the 
"limited" part), this show includes both prints and paintings. Adams was 
perfectly poised at cross roads between West Coast romantic surrealism, East 
Coast expressionism and European formalism imported to UCLA in the '50s by the 
visiting Stanton MacDonald Wright. He moves from one to the other, or 
incorporates combinations without missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
There's a handsome early work called "Back Stage" that turns banal props into 
haunting geometry. Tinged with surrealist portent is the fine egg tempera from 
the '50s, "Still Life With Yellow Sky." Several crisp, linear building facades 
have the regional warmth of American Precisionist works. If today's art is an 
indulged precocious child whose next project we anticipate with a combination 
of dread and excitement, the art of Clinton Adams is a staid, thoughtful uncle 
who always has something for everyone. (Toby C. Moss Gallery, 7321 Beverly 
Blvd. to March 4.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Art either confronts us with entropy and vanitas, or -- like the paintings of 
Santa Barbara's Rick Stich -- reassures us that there is still beauty and truth 
in spite of the spots on the rug and the six o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Stich has made loosely abstracted paintings from plein-air studies 
of shimmery koi, reflective ponds and idyllic gardens at Santa Barbara's Alice 
Keck Park. He's in the tradition of nature abstractionists from Monet to Dove 
to our own David Hockney whose pockets of color turned to light are formal 
cousins to these schematic, graceful ripples and plump fish. Besides koi, 
paintings show dense florals, water careening over smooth rocks, birds in 
flight. All are done with an ungainly roughness that's needed in paintings that 
are almost too pretty for their own good. The huge three-paneled "Swim in the 
Light" carries us from the poppy yellow of sunset over water to the transparent 
blue-grays and squiggly shadows of dusk. Stich may paint the best of all 
possible worlds but always with an eye to the expressive and compositional 
potential of light, color and shape. 
</P>

A rare, don't-miss sampling of quality Indian miniatures is concurrently on 
view at the gallery's Venice Boulevard space. Dated from the 16th-to-18th 
centuries when royal houses in India prized and cultivated tiny scenes of 
mythology and court life, the works are pristine jewels in the usual brilliant 
opaque pigments and fastidious detail of illumination. Show-stoppers include a 
prince caressing his favorite consort as dozens from his harem (each a minute 
individualized portrait) watch, serve, dance, converse. A gorgeous isolated 
portrait of a prince hints at the sort of stuff that took Manet and modernism 
by storm. Borrow the magnifying glass to really canvas one after another of 
these charming scenes. (L.A. Louver, 77 Market St., 55 N. Venice Blvd., to Feb.

</P>
<P>
Henry Jaglom's fascination with the subject of a film director in love bloomed 
again in "Someone to Love" (Paramount, $79.95, R), which, like his "Always," 
will seem uniquely sensitive to some, embarrassingly personal (and virtually 
unwatchable) to others. The 1988 comedy-drama features the last film appearance 
by Orson Welles. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Paramount also has some Valentine-oriented oldies out this 
weekend, all for $19.95: 
</P>
<P>
"Love With the Proper Stranger" (1963) is a cynical/sweet love story largely 
filmed on location in New York City. It stars Steve McQueen as a footloose 
musician and Natalie Wood as the Macy's salesgirl who tries to tie that foot 
down. Robert Mulligan directed. "The World of Suzie Wong" had William Holden, 
Nancy Kwan, a big budget for its year (1960), and several touching moments, but 
its American artist-tries-to-reform-Hong Kong-prostitute story still seems 
flawed and overlong (129-minutes). It's a little more interesting, though, than 
the tepid, black-and-white "September Affair" (1950), though the cast (Joseph 
Cotten, Joan Fontaine, Jessica Tandy) and the music are good. 
</P>
<P>
For the unromantic, there are three recent mush-less movies: "Border Radio" 
(Pacific Arts, $59.95, R) a gritty, sub-Jim Jarmusch, black-and-white drama 
starring local underground-rock musicians Chris D., John Doe and Dave Alvin; 
"Uncle Meat" (MPI, $59.95), Frank Zappa's 20-year record of his career; or, if 
Zappa isn't gross enough for you, "The Nest" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R), in which a 
small town is overrun by murderous cockroaches. Roger Corman produced. 
</P>
<P>
Other Videos 
</P>
<P>
If you're a fan of the man, you've probably already seen most of what's 
contained in "Bruce Springsteen: Video Anthology, 1978-1988" (CMV, $24.98), 
because it's simply a collection of the great singer-songwriter's often 
disappointing MTV-aimed videos. . . . "Talk Radio" star Eric Bogosian portrays 
a variety of obnoxious guys in "Eric Bogosian's Funhouse" (Pacific Arts, 
$24.95), a 60-minute record of his one-man stage show. 
</P>
<P>
"Margaret Mead and Samoa" (Brighton, $89.95) is a 51-minute documentary that 
examines the anthropologist's findings and theories regarding Polynesian 
society. For those who don't mind the overly high price, the information number 
is (800) 542-5554. On the other end of the price spectrum, one of the 
best-selling how-to video experts has yet another golfing-tips tape out: "Bob 
Mann's Golf: The Specialty Shots" (Simitar, $9.95). Or, if you've given up the 
links out of frustration, you can watch others suffer in "Just Missed, Dammit!" 
(Paramount, $19.95), a compilation of golf goofs.

<P>
Review 
</P>
<P>
****"The Complete Yellowstone."Holiday. $29.98. Information: (213) 945-3325. 
</P>
<P>
Just because Holiday makes "travel" tapes doesn't mean its videocassettes on 
national parks, etc., are any less artfully done or any less watchable than PBS 
and National Geographic documentaries on the same subjects. Russ Finley's 
superbly composed photography and pleasant narration, plus nice, unobtrusive 
music (and a lack of travelogue-ish false gaiety) highlight this 60-minute 
guide to major features of the great Western wilderness -- from boiling geysers 
to calm lakes and meadows, with an emphasis on wildlife. While the tape doesn't 
get into some aspects of the area that more in-depth views have (history, 
controversies, etc.), that isn't necessarily a minus for people who just want 
to know what to see when visiting -- i.e., you don't have to sit through 
something like the sad animal-in-distress sequence that ends a related video, 
"Yellowstone in Winter." Like the park itself, "The Complete Yellowstone" is a 
scenic wonder. TERRY ATKINSON

NBC'S 'UNSUB' CRIME-FIGHTER SERIES IS A CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you may have thought that prime-time had exhausted its supply of 
elite crime-fighting units that solve the seemingly insolvable, along comes 
NBC's "UNSUB" at 10 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
Occupying the former time slot of "Miami Vice" (now airing at 9), "UNSUB" is 
the epitome of the weary TV formula that refuses to go away. The elite unit in 
this case is the Federal Justice Department's Behavioral Science Unit, whose 
specialists wear hooded jumpsuits and speak into their personal recorders while 
blitzing the scenes of vicious crimes. These crackerjacks really know their 
criminals ("He might drive a bright-red sports car. It goes with repressed 
types. . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
Actually, tonight's perpetrator has simpler tastes. He's a serial killer who 
always murders his single female victims on Fridays and removes their shoes. He 
carries out his crimes after getting instructions from an imaginary "white bone 
demon." 
</P>
<P>
The production from Stephen J. Cannell is slick, and David Soul is crisp and 
efficient as the unit's leader, Westy Grayson. When the killer's identity is 
revealed swiftly and prematurely, however, all mystery and suspense vanish, 
allowing viewers to concentrate solely on the predictable pursuit and 
inevitable last-minute rescue. This is no elite series. HOWARD ROSENBERG

SAXMAN FREEMAN IS A TREAT, MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Chico Freeman Live at Ronnie Scott's," airing on the Bravo cable channel 
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Feb. 10 at 7 p.m., is much more than its deceptive title 
implies. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist is almost never shown with the London nightclub as a setting. 
At various points he may be sitting on a tree branch playing soprano sax, or 
blanketed in clouds of smoke, or walking away from his own image in a 
double-exposure scene shot in black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
When Freeman plays a tremolo, two alternating camera angles vibrate wildly in 
sympathy. When he uses multiphonics, there are multiple images to match. One 
sequence has him playing bass clarinet, with close-ups of his eye and other odd 
shots while he voice-overs a story about a dream, and another about his idol 
Eric Dolphy. 
</P>
<P>
Visual values aside, Freeman covers a broad musical span, from basic blues to 
funk to modal and avant garde, mostly on tenor saxophone. His personality comes 
across vividly as he talks about music as politics, later telling an anecdote 
about a black man at the gates of heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman leaves a quartet worthy of him, with admirable work by Kenny Barron on 
piano, Freddie Waits on drums and Santti Debriano on bass. Most of the 
compositions are his own, reflecting the range of his talent and tastes. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rare pleasure to hear so much first-rate jazz presented with 
imagination, at no cost to the musical values. Directors Stephen Cleary and 
Robert Lemkin deserve the credit. LEONARD FEATHER

JIM MURRAY: SECOND FIDDLE ISN'T THE WAY TOM KITE PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now, but Tom Kite is in a groove. Everything's working perfectly. 
The swing is compact, fluid. The putting stroke is smooth. The ball is drawing 
satisfactorily in the heavy air. All the signs are right. 
</P>
<P>
He's going to finish second again. 
</P>
<P>
Kite does this better than anyone on the tour. He's got it down to a science. 
Some guys drive farther, hit straighter, have better short games. His specialty 
is coming in second. His theme song should be "Second-Hand Rose." 
</P>
<P>
Tom is consistent. He's durable. He can really play. There is very little doubt 
he is in the top five playing the game today and belongs with the top who ever 
played the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kite has won $4,342,413 playing golf. Only two players have won more. But he's 
won only 10 tournaments. Lots of players have won more. Comes to $430,000 a 
victory for Tom. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Kite has finished second 17 times in the last 7 years. Hardly anybody 
can top that. Jack Nicklaus was second 58 times in his illustrious career. But 
he won 71 times. Tom Kite is golf's silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a statistic that thrills Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
If you drew up a profile of a guy who finishes second all the time what you 
would come up with is a guy who would see an ink blot of a butterfly as a 
dragon, a guy who might fold a winning hand rather than see a raise, a guy 
who'd stand on 16. 
</P>
<P>
In golf, you figure he goes for the fat part of the green, not the spot where 
the flag hangs over a sand trap or an alligator pond. He tries not to 1-putt if 
it might lead to 3 putts. He plays away from trouble and he finishes second 
because the alternative is either first -- or ninth. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be a tremendous player to finish first or second 27 times, but the 
golf public figures he's a guy who tried to clinch with the course instead of 
throwing rights at it. A bolder player, they're sure, might reverse the 10-17 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Kite may be an overachiever. When he came out of Austin onto the Tour 
in 1973, the eyes of Texas were really upon fellow townsman Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Kite was considered to have a nice little country-club game. Expectations were 
not high. He would be a cheery little fringe player. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw, on the other hand, won the first tournament he played in as a pro. He 
was widely regarded as a combination of Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp and Ben 
Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
Kite plodded along with hardly anybody noticing. He got better every year. He 
began to win a tournament a year. He wasn't long, he wasn't strong, he was just 
usually standing on a green, pushing his glasses up his nose and saying sweetly 
to someone, "I believe it's you." 
</P>
<P>
He was so steady, it was frightening. In 1981, he teed it up 26 times and 
finished 21 times in the top 10. He was the leading money winner that year and 
had the lowest stroke average of any player in the country. He usually leads or 
is close in scoring average every year. Tom Kite knows the short way around 
every golf course he ever played. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, he wasn't the other golfer from Austin any more. He and 
Crenshaw were an entry. Like Crenshaw, he seems to stay young on a golf course. 
The owl-like spectacles, the orange-red hair, the jaunty step and cheery 
expression make him one of the most recognizable players on a golf course where 
there aren't many anymore. 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong here? This is not the profile of a guy who ends up as a worthy 
opponent. This is the profile of the guy who ends up "Winner and still 
champion!" 
</P>
<P>
So why does he go through life as first runner-up? Why is he the guy of whom 
the wags say, "Kite? Bet him to place!" 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite thinks the emphasis should be on the fact that he's the one to beat, 
not the one who is beat. 
</P>
<P>
He is not defensive on a course, he insists. He goes for the flag with the best 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to, or I wouldn't even be second," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The reputation, he feels, derives from his style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not 6-2, 220," he explains. (He's 5-8, 155.) "When a player isn't 6-2, 
220, he has to play within his limitations. And he tends to look to the public 
as non-aggressive. A player looks aggressive when he reaches the par-5s in 2 -- 
or when he even tries to. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I can't reach the par-5s in 2. I'm not given the opportunity to play 
what appears to be aggressive golf. My average drive last year was 259.8 yards. 
That made me, like, 75th in driving distance. but I was fourth in driving 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really a fairly aggressive player. I don't give in to a golf course. But 
I'm not a stupid player. You don't last out here making dumb mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Kite adds: "I think the strength of my game lies in the fact it has no 
weaknesses. It's not a power game. I can't bust the ball 290 yards. But I can 
bust it straight. I'm a good putter. Not the best but in the top 25. I'm not 
the best sand player. But I'm No. 9. There's not a shot I can't play." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't lead the world in eagles, chip-ins or 60-foot no-brainers in the 
hole. Tom Kite is steady. 
</P>
<P>
But he keeps coming into focus as a guy who has to try harder. Tom Kite's 
current image is a guy who lost the Nabisco $2-million tournament in a playoff 
at Pebble Beach last fall and the AT&amp;T at Pebble Beach last week. Two putts 
cost him $209,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People come up and say condolences," Kite notes. "Condolences for what? I shot 
10 under par on three of the toughest courses in the world last week and I had 
a guy birdie the last hole on me. But I put all that behind me. Do you realize 
how good you have to be to finish second out here?" 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Tom Kite, very, very, very good. Look at it this way -- anybody 
can finish first. 
</P>
<P>
Kite's 73, shot in the wind-raked first round of the Nissan Los Angeles Open 
Thursday, was a long way from second place. But you don't beat Tom Kite in an 
opening round. Sometimes, it takes you clear to the 72nd hole or even the 73rd 
or 74th before you can shove him clear back to second place.

MORNING BRIEFING: CS SACRAMENTO TEAM IS ONE FOR THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cal State Sacramento joined the Great Northern Conference, which stretches 
all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, some creative scheduling was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The last home game for the Hornets was Jan. 18. After that, they were off for 
10 days. Now they are finishing up with eight straight games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Joe Anders: "January was a great month to be a Hornet. February is a 
great month to be a Hornet travel agent." 
</P>
<P>
If Kiki Vandeweghe is traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the New York 
Knicks, he will join the team his father, Ernie, played for in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Glickman, who was the Knick radio announcer, told the Hartford Courant: 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie was a tremendous guy. A medical student who joined the Knicks out of 
Colgate. His med school schedule was such that he would arrive at the game just 
in time to play. He would get dressed in the restrooms of airplanes and come to 
the arena ready. I can see him now, coming onto a court still lacing his 
sneakers." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ernie: He was born in Canada, where his father was a furrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a spoiled little boy, " he told Zander Hollander in "The Modern 
Encyclopedia of Basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"I had everything I wanted, especially when it came to sports equipment. I had 
a hockey rink in my back yard, a basketball court, a motorboat, skates, hunting 
gun and a horse. That's when I thought I would be a jockey."

Trivia Time: Who was the last defenseman to score four goals in a National 
Hockey League game? He played for the Kings. (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
From Wallace Matthews of Newsday: "Is this ridiculous or what? Bruce (the 
Mouse) Strauss, who in the words of Randy Gordon of the New York State Athletic 
Commission has more aliases than most fighters have bouts, was approved to 
fight Harry Arroyo in Rochester as a substitute for Donald Gwinn, who was under 
lifetime suspension. Gwinn's crime? Fighting under an assumed name." 
</P>
<P>
Add Matthews: "Overheard at the Leonard-Hearns news conference, one fight guy 
talking about another: 'He was a moron. He took the test for imbecile and 
failed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Edmonton Coach Glen Sather, responding to reports that the Oilers were 
having difficulty filling the stands since trading Wayne Gretzky to the Kings: 
"We've had 97% and 98% capacity. I'd have used 99, but we're not using that 
number anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The basketball teams weren't the only ones putting up big numbers Tuesday at 
Loyola Marymount. Before the basketball game, in which Loyola beat USIU, 
181-150, the schools met in baseball. Loyola won, 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Answer: Ian Turnbull. He scored 4 goals against Vancouver on Dec. 12, 
1981.

DAVIS CUP;

U.S. DOESN'T GET WORKED UP UNTIL IT LOSES GRIP

<P>
It was once said of Davis Cup tennis competition that millions of people are 
passionately interested. It was also once said that, of that number, dozens 
come from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, you have your World Series and Super Bowls," said 
Francisco Gonzalez, a member of Paraguay's Davis Cup team that will play the 
United States, here, starting today. "In Paraguay and other countries like it, 
the Davis Cup is that to us. It is everything." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has won more Davis Cup titles than any other country, 28. Yet 
the average sports fan probably thinks the Davis Cup is something Al gives out 
on Sunday afternoons to the game's most valuable Raider. 
</P>
<P>
If that's an exaggeration, it's only a slight one. Most people know the Davis 
Cup is tennis between countries, that the matches tend to go on forever and 
that a lot of them tend to be played in places that you get to by paddling your 
hollowed-out tree upstream. 
</P>
<P>
So why do those who know it well hold it so dearly? Why does somebody such as 
John McEnroe get teary-eyed at the thought of it, or somebody such as Ken Flach 
get that faraway look in his eye, clench his fist and mutter that this is the 
real thing? 
</P>
<P>
Michael Davies is the director of marketing for the International Tennis 
Federation, the organizing and sanctioning body of Davis Cup tennis. He is also 
a former Davis Cup player from Great Britain, who can speak both passionately 
and knowledgeably about it. "I had one of those magic moments myself," Davies 
said Thursday. "I played Wimbledons and big tournaments, turned pro with Jack 
Kramer and his group in 1960. But that Davis Cup match, well, there's just 
nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Great Britain against France, the score tied, 2-2, Davies trailed 
Frenchman Robert Haillet by 2 sets. But he battled back to win, 8-6, in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't even for the overall Davis Cup title, just a semifinal in the 
European zone," Davies recalled. "But it was so special, to be down like that, 
on the slow clay at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, and come back to win for 
your country." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, for your country. Perhaps that's the key. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Cash can be playing somebody from Mexico in a key match at Wimbledon or 
the U.S. Open and most often he'll win," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
"But put him against that same Mexican, at 7,000 feet altitude in Mexico City, 
with the crowd wild for the home player, people waving flags and the surface 
the kind of slow clay the Mexicans love and you can throw out all the rankings 
and expectations in the world. You've got a close-to-even match." 
</P>
<P>
So, on the day that the United States begins its comeback effort in the main 
(World Group) draw after a couple of years of losing the struggles off in 
various jungles, not to mention Hartford, Conn., it is timely to take a look at 
just what the Davis Cup is. Much of the information and background provided 
here comes from Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Why is it called the Davis Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Dwight Filley Davis, a tennis player at Harvard, donated a trophy that 
he designated to go to the winner of an international tennis competition. That 
was 1900, and the competition, with a few interruptions for wars, has gone on 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How many countries compete? 
</P>
<P>
A: This year, a record 79 will compete. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that the United States can win the Davis Cup this year, whereas, 
last year, it could not. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The United States was knocked out of what is called the World Group 
draw of 16 in 1987, when it lost at Paraguay and then lost at Hartford later in 
the year to West Germany. That meant that, just to get back into World Group 
draw in 1989, the United States had to beat Argentina and Peru last year. Only 
teams in the World Draw can win the Cup. The rest are playing just to get to 
the World Draw. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is the United States playing Paraguay again? 
</P>
<P>
A: Luck of the draw. The 16 teams making the World Group were tossed into a hat 
in October, and the United States pulled out Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do they seed the draw after they make it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, this year's World Group has Sweden, the 1987 champion, and West 
Germany, the '88 winner, seeded to meet in the final. The United States is 
seeded third and would probably have to get past West Germany and Boris Becker 
in the semifinals in West Germany in late July to get to the title round. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If the United States wins here, who's next? 
</P>
<P>
A: The winner here will go against the winner of the Israel-France match, 
either in Israel or against France in the United States, site to be determined, 
April 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is this being played in Ft. Myers? 
</P>
<P>
A: The resort here merely provided the right surroundings, seating capacity and 
financial guarantee to the United States Tennis Assn., which solicits bids 
immediately after the draw is made. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the chances of a Davis Cup final coming to the Los Angeles area 
this year, assuming the team goes that far and has the home advantage for the 
final? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably slim, even though the final is scheduled for Dec. 15-17 and 
California is among the few warm-weather sites that time of year. Because there 
is a Grand Prix tournament at the Hyatt Grand Champions resort in the Palm 
Springs area a few months later, the Davis Cup people tend to take this sort of 
thing someplace else where fans haven't had the opportunity to see top players. 
Nor do they hesitate to play it indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do the players get any prize money out of this? 
</P>
<P>
A: This year's Davis Cup purse totals $3 million. Every country that competes 
will get a slice of that, but the more you win, the more your association gets 
and the more it distributes to the players. The only thing is, the distribution 
isn't until the end of the year, when all the places have been decided. For 
example, Michael Chang will likely play just here for the American team, then 
be replaced by McEnroe. Chang will get his slice based on final standings and 
based on how many matches he played.

LEUKEMIA PATIENT TO ACCEPT RISEN STAR'S ECLIPSE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trophy presenters at the Eclipse Awards dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel 
will include Merv Griffin, Eva Gabor, Jack Klugman, Dick Van Patten, Tim Conway 
and Burt Bacharach. John Forsythe will be the master of ceremonies at the 
annual affair that honors the previous year's thoroughbred racing champions. 
</P>
<P>
But a 14-year-old girl from Klamath Falls, Ore., figures to upstage them. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Armstrong, representing Louie Roussel, will accept the bronze Eclipse 
statuette won by Risen Star, the best 3-year-old colt in the country last year. 
Roussel is the co-owner and trainer of Risen Star. 
</P>
<P>
They met on the backstretch at Belmont Park last June, this teen-ager who has 
leukemia and the 43-year-old horseman who once suffered from cancer. A few 
hours, later, Risen Star won the Belmont Stakes, running the race in a time 
that only his great sire, Secretariat, had bettered. 
</P>
<P>
Before that sensational race, it had not been an easy morning around Risen 
Star's barn. Veterinarians were treating the colt for an inflammation that had 
flared up in an old ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Armstrong wasn't feeling so good herself. She had been undergoing 
chemotherapy. There had even been some question whether she and her mother, 
Karen, would be able to travel to New York for the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
But everything was set. Some sheriff's deputies from the City of Industry had 
chipped in to help pay for the trip -- Michelle's father, Jack, had worked for 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. before he retired and the family moved 
to southern Oregon -- and Churchill Downs, the Triple Crown people and the New 
York Racing Assn. had arranged for their accommodations at the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sick and I'm going to the Belmont," Michelle told her mother. 
</P>
<P>
So they had flown to New York. When Michelle and her family had gone to the 
Kentucky Derby 6 weeks before, they had traveled by train, which took more than 
3 days. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, whose condition had been diagnosed in November of 1986, had been 
given that Derby trip by the Oregon Make-a-Wish program, which fulfills dreams 
of critically ill children. In completing an application for her wish, Michelle 
told about her 15-year-old riding horse, Nebo, and explained how she wanted to 
see the filly, Winning Colors, run in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors not only ran, she became the third filly to win the race, and 
Michelle was part of the bedlam in the winner's circle. Gary Stevens, Winning 
Colors' jockey, gave her a flower from the blanket of roses. She had fallen in 
love with Winning Colors after watching on television as the filly won the 
Santa Anita Derby in April. 
</P>
<P>
Then Risen Star beat Winning Colors while winning the Preakness, the middle leg 
of the Triple Crown, and he was trying to beat her again in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
But after visiting Risen Star the morning of the Belmont Stakes, Michelle 
Armstrong had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I met Mr. Roussel, I was rooting for Winning Colors again," she said 
this week. "But Mr. Roussel was real nice, and I liked his horse, too." 
</P>
<P>
So Michelle had her mother bet on both horses in the Belmont. It's not a good 
way to bet the races, but it's the only way to satisfy your heart. And Michelle 
was in the winner's circle for the Risen Star celebration after the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Then Roussel called the day before Christmas, asking her to accept the award. 
</P>
<P>
So tonight, two horses will be tugging at Michelle's heartstrings again, 
because Winning Colors also won an Eclipse, as the year's best 3-year-old 
filly.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: LEWIS' VACATION WAS NO DAY AT THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Brett Lewis, Channel 4's weekend sports anchor? Nice smile, dry wit? 
Yeah, that's the guy. 
</P>
<P>
He was last seen filling in for George Michael on the late-night, nationally 
syndicated "Sports Machine" show on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went on vacation, or at least that was the official word from Channel 
4. 
</P>
<P>
But 5 weeks of vacation for someone who has been on the job less than a year? 
And during Super Bowl Week, to boot? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Lewis hasn't been on vacation. At least not the kind on which you go 
to Hawaii and lie in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
He's been sleeping. Rather, trying to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis suffers from a sleeping disorder -- actually two -- and he went to a 
clinic in Cincinnati to get treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Besides insomnia, Lewis also has sleep apnea, meaning that once he manages to 
fall asleep, he often stops breathing. 
</P>
<P>
It's rare for one person to suffer from both disorders. 
</P>
<P>
He's better now and is back in Los Angeles. He will be filling in for Fred 
Roggin on the 6 o'clock news tonight, and then will resume his regular spots 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
During lunch at a restaurant in Toluca Lake, Lewis pulled out a photograph of 
himself in bed, wearing what appeared to be an oxygen mask strapped to his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
The apparatus, he said, is called a C-Pap machine. He's now using it to help 
him sleep. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken some getting used to, he said, but the other night he slept 6 
hours straight, then was able to sleep a little more. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up, looked at the clock, saw it was 7:30, and gave out a big, 'All 
right!' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the clinic in Cincinnati, it was discovered that, during a 1-hour test 
period, there were about 200 interruptions in his breathing pattern. At times, 
he quit breathing for as long as 30 seconds and at other times his breathing 
was labored for as long as 60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he has never been a sound sleeper, and in 1983, while working at a 
station in Dallas, his hometown, he began having sleepless nights. 
</P>
<P>
The problem continued through the 4 years he worked in Miami, and worsened 
after he came to Los Angeles. He knew he needed help. 
</P>
<P>
John Rohrbeck, Channel 4's general manager, agreed and gave him time off, even 
though the timing was bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the station have been extremely supportive," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the most important thing he has learned is, when you can't sleep, 
don't stay in bed. You can't just lie there, hoping to go to sleep, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With me, it became a psychological thing, where I hated going to bed," he 
said. "I'd drive home from work dead tired, then get into bed and be wide 
awake. 
</P>
<P>
"The best advice I can give people who have trouble sleeping is, get out of bed 
and watch TV, or do something mindless like that," he said. Then, chuckling, he 
added, "I guess I shouldn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
Golf woes: A year ago, when CBS televised the Nissan Los Angeles Open, it 
rained on the day of the final round, causing two delays. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. (6 p.m. in the East) the leaders were only on the sixth hole, so CBS, 
seeing no hope of making it to the finish, cut away. 
</P>
<P>
What L.A. viewers got instead was a USC-Washington basketball game, a battle 
for last place in the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 was bombarded with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing could happen again this year. The forecast calls for a chance of 
rain Sunday, and there's another college basketball game, this time UCLA vs. 
Oregon State, scheduled for 3 p.m. on Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's final-round Open coverage is scheduled to run from 1:30 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Add golf: All too often, a golf tournament runs long and television, preferring 
to not preempt prime-time programming, misses the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Chirkanian, long-time executive producer of golf for CBS, says one thing 
that would help alleviate the problem would be faster play. 
</P>
<P>
"Players just keep getting slower and slower," he said. "It shouldn't take 4 
1/2 to 5 hours to play a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame the college coaches. They tell these players, 'Don't shoot until 
you're ready.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chirkanian says the PGA needs to get tougher. "Each player in any foursome 
holding up play should be penalized a stroke at the 10th hole and told that 
unless they speed up, another 1-stroke penalty awaits them at the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
"That way if one player is holding things up, his partners will get all over 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they fine a slow player $1,000. That's absurd. A guy wins $180,000, and 
you fine him $1,000. He pays that and throws in a $500 tip." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chirkanian: He's been involved with golf on CBS since 1958. His first 
assignment was as director of that year's PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
He's had quite a career and is well respected in the golf world. Now, at 62, he 
may be ready to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a year left on a 5-year contract," he said. "When it expires, I'll have 
to decide what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Jane (his wife of 13 years) likes to shop, so I may have to keep working. 
Seriously, I'm just not sure what I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Above and beyond the call of duty: ABC's Keith Jackson, despite getting the 
news Saturday morning that his mother, Polly Bragg, had died in Georgia, still 
worked that afternoon's Michigan-Purdue basketball game at West Lafayette, Ind. 
His mother suffered a stroke in November. "If she were here, she would have 
said, 'Son, just do your job,' " he said. . . . A case of the flu last weekend 
didn't keep Chick Hearn from extending his streak on consecutive games worked, 
which has reached 2,193. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC's Jim Healy compares Hearn's streak to the one held by Joe Hernandez, the 
Santa Anita race caller who collapsed on the job on Jan. 27, 1972, and died a 
few days later. Hernandez went 37 years without missing a workday. Hearn has 
gone 23. . . . Correction: The football game that kept Hearn from making a 
Laker game in November, 1965, the last one he missed, was between Arkansas and 
Texas Tech, not Arkansas and USC, as reported in this space last week. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5, which has been getting dreadful ratings for Clipper games, has 
dropped a Feb. 26 telecast from Detroit because it falls during a rating sweeps 
period. The date will be made up with a telecast from San Antonio March 13. . . 
. It's not quite Broadway, but ESPN boxing commentator Al Bernstein, who is 
also a professional singer, isn't complaining. He recently worked Todd Foster's 
first pro fight in Foster's hometown of Great Falls, Mont., made a contact 
there and has been invited back to sing at the Heritage Inn in Great Falls next 
Friday. . . . HBO offers an attractive welterweight card Saturday night at 7 
from the Las Vegas Hilton: Lloyd Honeyghan vs. Marlon Starling and Mark Breland 
vs. Seung Soon Lee. . . . Mike Tyson will be Roy Firestone's guest on 
"SportsLook" on ESPN Monday at 3:30 and 11 p.m., and Frank Bruno will be on 
Tuesday's show. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: The Millrose Games, possibly the top meet of the indoor 
track season, will be held tonight at Madison Square Garden and shown Saturday 
at noon on NBC as a 1-hour edited show. The announcers, Charlie Jones, Frank 
Shorter and Dwight Stones, attend the meet but don't call the action until 
early the next morning. "It makes for a very long workday," Jones said. "But 
I'm not complaining. This should be a great meet." . . . "The History of 
College Basketball," a 1-hour show narrated by Curt Gowdy and produced by Rasha 
Drackovitch of San Francisco, will be on Channel 4 Sunday at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Strub Stakes will be previewed tonight at 8:30 on Channel 56, and the 
race will be on ESPN. Coverage Sunday begins at 4:30 p.m., the race about 4:45. 
. . . Former pitcher Jim Kaat, who has done a nice job as a college baseball 
announcer for ESPN, has been hired as a full-timer by the cable network and 
will appear regularly on "SportsCenter." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale interviews Indiana Coach Bob Knight on "SportsCenter" Sunday night 
at 8. . . . Jim Zrake, former executive producer of sports for the USA network, 
has been named to a similar position at Los Angeles' Z Channel. . . . Loyola, 
the nation's top scoring team, faces St. Mary's, No. 2 in defense, tonight at 
7:30, and the game will be televised in the LAX area by American Cable Systems 
on Channel 27. Terry Runzler and Mario Palladini report.

WINTERNATIONALS;

<P>
RECORDS FALL IN HOT QUALIFYING ROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Cool conditions brought out quick times in Thursday's opening qualifying rounds 
of the Chief Auto Parts Winternationals drag races at Pomona, but not for the 
three defending Winston Series world champions. 
</P>
<P>
Four-time funny car champion Kenny Bernstein of Newport Beach failed to post a 
time when something popped in the experimental engine in his Buick during a 
warm-up burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-time pro stock champion Bob Glidden of Whiteland, Ind., failed to make the 
top 16 qualifiers after backing off the throttle of his Ford Probe when Harry 
Scribner's car appeared to be drifting toward Glidden's lane. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time top-fuel champion Joe Amato of Old Forge, Pa., qualified eighth but 
was overshadowed by a group of old-timers who reached record speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Kalitta, a 49-year-old veteran from Ypsilanti, Mich., who won the 
Winternationals in 1967, blasted through the speed traps at 286.25 m.p.h., 
bettering the track record of 284.90 by Amato last October in the World Finals 
and the event record of 284.81 by Eddie Hill last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high speed, Kalitta was only third on the first-day grid as Dennis 
Forcelle of Minneapolis, last year's top fuel rookie of the year at age 47, 
produced a record elapsed time of 5.068 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Close behind was Gary Ormsby with a 5.084. Kalitta's elapsed time was 5.105. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Larson, a pioneer of funny cars from Dauphin, Pa., who has been driving 
for three decades, found new life in his '89 Olds Cutlass as he posted a 
Winternationals record of 5.387 seconds. This bettered Ed McCulloch's year-old 
mark of 5.395. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise was a 7.361-second record time by Larry Morgan, a 
third-year professional pro stock driver from Newark, Ohio. Morgan gave warning 
earlier in the week when he ran a 7.27 on the lightning-fast track in Houston.

Goaltender Wendell Young, who was traded by Philadelphia to Pittsburgh last 
summer, turned back 39 shots Thursday to help his new team beat the Flyers, 
5-3, and end the Penguins' 42-game winless streak at Philadelphia's Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh had lost 39 games and tied three since its last victory at 
Philadelphia, Jan. 20, 1974. The victory was Young's first against the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can just concentrate on playing hockey," said Pittsburgh's Mario 
Lemieux. "If we meet them, we know we can beat them in the playoffs here. . . . 
This was one of the barriers we had to overcome as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Errey gave the Penguins a 3-1 lead in the second period on a short-handed 
goal when he tipped in a shot by Lemieux, who had two assists in the game. Rob 
Brown's goal gave the Penguins a 3-goal advantage going into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bullard and Pelle Eklund scored for the Flyers in the final period, but 
Dan Quinn ensured the victory for the Penguins with his 29th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 3, Detroit 2 -- Joe Nieuwendyk scored at 1:45 of overtime to give the 
Flames the victory over the Red Wings at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Gary Roberts had tied the game midway through the third period. Hakan 
Loob scored the other goal for the Flames, who are unbeaten in their last six 
games with five wins and a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Yzerman and Gerard Gallant scored for the Red Wings, who are winless in 
their last three games and 2-6 in their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Quebec 1 -- Gillies Thibaudeau scored twice and Stephane Richer 
added a goal and two assists to lead the Canadiens to victory at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens had lost three of their first four meetings against the Nordiques 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
St Louis 7, Buffalo 3 -- The Blues won back-to-back games for the first time 
since Dec. 6 and took over second place in the Norris Division with the victory 
at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Tony McKegney scored at 0:21 and again at 14:08 to give the Blues a 3-2 lead in 
the opening period, which featured three goals and 26 shots in the the first 
1:47. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Vaive, Dave Andreychuk and Mike Hartman scored for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, New York Islanders 1 -- Tom Fergus scored the tie-breaking goal late 
in the second period to lead the Maple Leafs past the Islanders at Uniondale, 
N.Y., in a meeting of the teams with the worst records in the National Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto went ahead, 2-1, on Fergus' goal, and added two goals in the last 
minute of the game.

KNICKS NOTCH 16TH STRAIGHT VICTORY AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Knicks won their 16th straight game at Madison Square Garden 
Thursday night, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers, 125-109, in a meeting of 
Eastern Conference division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, atop the Atlantic Division, are 2-1 this season against the 
Cavaliers, who lead the Central Division with a 32-10 record, the best in the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing and Gerald Wilkins scored 21 points each and Trent Tucker broke 
his own team record for 3-point baskets in a season to help New York hold the 
lead the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, 19-1 at home 29-16 overall, were ahead, 36-25, after the first 
quarter, but Cleveland closed to 44-43 midway in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Then Tucker's 3-point basket, his 70th this season, highlighted a 13-2 run that 
closed the first half and put the Knicks ahead by 15 points. Tucker's previous 
record of 69 3-pointers was set last season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, trailing 111-94, went on a 11-0 run with 8 minutes remaining, but 
never came within 10 points of the Knicks in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, which played without injured forward Larry Nance, was led by Mike 
Sanders, who scored 30 points and Ron Harper, who had 23. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 112, Atlanta 103 -- Alex English scored 36 points and Fat Lever recorded 
his fourth triple-double of the season as the Nuggets held off a fourth-quarter 
rally to beat the Hawks at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, which trailed by 20 points early in the third quarter, pulled within 
one point of Denver with 4:03 remaining in the game. But the Nuggets outscored 
the Hawks, 9-1, to secure the win. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta played without Dominique Wilkins, who missed only the 14th game of his 
7-year career with a bruised right thumb, suffered in Wednesday night's game 
against the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Lever had 23 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists, and Michael Adams added 21 
points for Denver. Reggie Theus led Atlanta with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 109, Sacramento 98 -- Michael Jordan, held to 9 first-half points, 
scored 31 in the second half to lead the Bulls past the Kings at Chicago. It 
was Chicago's ninth victory in its last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, 3-21 on the road, had a 55-46 lead early in the third quarter when 
Jordan scored 15 points to fuel a 22-7 run and give the Bulls a 68-62 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 100, Miami 93 -- Derrick McKey scored 9 of his 19 points during an 11-2 
fourth-quarter run to lead the SuperSonics to victory at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics led, 83-79, in the fourth quarter when Dale Ellis, who scored 
30 points, began the Sonics' run with a tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 127, New Jersey 113 -- Mitch Richmond scored 32 points and Terry 
Teagle added 22 and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Warriors over the Nets at 
Oakland. It was the Warriors' seventh straight victory and the ninth in their 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets' Lester Conner had 13 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists -- his first 
career triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets played without Joe Barry Carroll, out with lower back strain, and Buck 
Williams, who is out with the flu.

GOOD OR BAD, PAYTON IS TOO MUCH FOR TROJANS; 
</P>
<P>
HIS SHOOTING IS OFF, BUT HE HELPS OREGON STATE KEEP USC WINLESS IN PAC-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After scoring 17 points and getting 11 assists in a 74-65 victory over USC 
Thursday night at the Sports Arena, Oregon State guard Gary Payton was asked to 
evaluate himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all played bad, especially me," Payton said. "I played terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Payton, the leading scorer in the Pacific 10 Conference, was as cold as an 
Alaskan night, missing 10 of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
George Raveling, USC coach, thought Payton was too hard on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think Payton played terrible," Raveling said. "Maybe he said that 
because he didn't shoot well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Gary Payton is a great player. He's taken average players and made a 
great team out of them. If he did play a bad game, he did contribute in other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked a trade tonight. He could have played for me. The reality 
of it is, put him on either team and that team wins." 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Trojans, who fell to 7-13 overall and 0-9 in the Pacific 10 
Conference and have lost nine straight, certainly could have used Payton, one 
of the nation's best point guards. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Anthony Pendleton, USC's leading scorer, was hampered by a back injury, 
which limited him to just 4 minutes. With Pendleton sidelined, the Trojans 
lacked firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Grande started in place of Pendleton, and Raveling made two other lineup 
changes in an effort to pump some life into the Trojans. Alan Pollard replaced 
Chris Munk at center, and guard Andy Olivarez started in place of forward Chris 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided that at this point in the season, we have to do something 
different," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
But the revamped Trojans didn't play any better than the old-look Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
USC was unable to handle Oregon State's pressure defense. The Trojans had 21 
turnovers and forced just 3. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 48-48, USC committed 7 turnovers in its next 9 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said: "I feel bad for you guys (the media). It must challenge your 
literary ability to keep writing these stories, just as it challenges my 
coaching ability. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers (14-4, 7-3), playing without forward Will Brantley, who was out 
with the flu and bronchitis, looked inconsistent against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how we'd play without Will," Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller 
said. "Sometimes we played well and sometimes we played bad. We didn't have any 
consistency. We would get up by 10 and then they would come right back. And I'm 
not talking about once, but four or five times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll need Will back (for Sunday's game at UCLA). We need his 
experience. Hopefully, he'll be back by Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Martin, who started in place of Brantley, had 14 points and 6 rebounds, 
and guard Eric Knox had 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman led USC with 18 points and 8 rebounds and Chris Moore 
had 16 points off the bench. Guard Tyrone Fuller had 11 points. Oregon State 
Coach Ralph Miller, who is ending his 38-year coaching career, was honored in a 
pregame ceremony. USC gave Miller a trip to San Diego, a record album of the 
Trojan band and a videotape of the USC song girls. Miller also received his 
666th victory. . . . The Trojans play Oregon Saturday at 3 p.m. at the Sports 
Arena.

UNUSUAL SAND TRAP ON NO. 6 AT RIVIERA EVEN GIVES THE PROS PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the fun if you were allowed to put obstacles of your choosing on the 
playing field of a major sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't a dozen ice-fishing holes at the blue line during the Stanley Cup 
finals be a riot? 
</P>
<P>
How about erecting a reef at the midpoint of the America's Cup course? 
</P>
<P>
Does the thought of putting a pair of stuffed, snarling mountain lions along 
the homestretch of the Kentucky Derby make you smile? 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe digging a huge, gaping sand trap in the middle of a green at a 
prestigious course such as the Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
But if that last suggestion really sounds like a beauty, forget it. It has 
already been done. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Bell and George Thomas were the culprits. They did it more than 60 years 
ago. And 60 years certainly seems like plenty of time to have gotten it fixed. 
But the crater they dug smack in the middle of the sixth green on the fabled 
course was still there on Thursday during the opening round of the Nissan Los 
Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the damage hasn't been repaired because Bell and Thomas were the course 
architects. A couple of real jokers, it seems. The types of guys who would 
probably list Jack Webb of "Dragnet" as their favorite comedian. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that the elephant-sized hole was included in the design blueprints 
and was not the work of pranksters with shovels has not made it any more 
popular with the players. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Casper once lofted a shot onto the green at the 170-yard, par-3 hole but 
found the trap sitting between his ball and the pin. Enraged at what he 
perceived as a mockery of the game of golf, Casper took out his pitching wedge 
and readied himself for a chip off the green's surface, over the trap and back 
onto the green. 
</P>
<P>
His preparations included three practice swings, all of which stripped huge 
clods of the finely manicured and precisely clipped grass from the putting 
surface. He then chipped to within a few inches of the pin, made his par and 
stalked off the green. 
</P>
<P>
The pros are still allowed to chip from the putting surface, but that practice 
is not allowed by the members. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the pin was placed 20 feet in front of the green trap and was not of 
much concern to the accurate-shooting pros. Later in the tournament, however, 
the pin will be moved to the green's upper tier and players will be forced to 
contend with the trap as they shoot for the pin. It is the only such hole on 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
One player during the opening round, Steve Brodie of Long Beach, dropped his 
tee shot on the very edge of the trap and it appeared that he would be the 
first of the 1989 tournament to blast out of a green with a sand wedge. But his 
ball stopped on the precipice and then began a slow and methodical roll down a 
slight hill toward the flag. It stopped 5 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie was apparently so thrilled by his escape from danger and his good 
fortune that he promptly rolled his 5-foot putt 3 feet past the cup. He did, 
however, recover for a par. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the sixth green were dozens of Riviera members and others who have 
played the course. And they exchanged nods and sly grins at Brodie's encounter 
with what the L.A. Open media guide calls the "notorious giant-killer." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Felder of Santa Monica plays Riviera regularly, he said, and playing No. 6 
brings him roughly the same amount of pleasure as having a stiff comb dragged 
briskly across his upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us who shoot in the 80s and 90s start worrying about that damn trap 
about the second or third hole," Felder said. "It can be a nightmare. You hit 
what is a perfect shot for the average golfer, and you're either in the damn 
thing or behind it with no chance for a par. There have been days I swore I was 
going to come back here at night with a tractor and fill that thing in." 
</P>
<P>
Another weekend golfer, Mike Sullivan of Redondo Beach, said he had played the 
course once, in 1987. He has taken exactly one shot from the sixth tee in his 
entire life. Guess where it landed? 
</P>
<P>
"It flew right into the trap, about 6 inches from the side," he said. "I had to 
stand on the green and bend over and reach down about 3 feet to the ball. It 
felt like a miniature golf course. One of the guys I played with was laughing 
like mad. He told me, 'Wait until the next hole. It has a clown's face and 
you've gotta putt the ball up his nose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, views the trap as a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I played here a few times and had trouble with that thing a few times," said 
Willie Wilson of Long Beach. "But it was fun. I played a course in South Miami 
years ago and it had a tree in the middle of the green. A big palm tree. And I 
had trouble with that, too. But even that was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, one would assume, might really slap his knee and howl if he had to putt 
through a pond.

JIM BENEPE HAS SOLUTION FOR TRAP ON NO. 6: HE MAKES A HOLE IN ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Benepe doesn't do things half way. He won the first tour tournament he ever 
entered, the Western Open in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He also figured out a way to beat the troublesome sixth hole at Riviera, the 
one with the sand trap in the middle. Playing Riviera for the first time 
Thursday, Benepe got a hole in one on the sixth hole, his first ever in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Benepe, who used a 6-iron on the par-3, 163-yard hole, said: "I caught the ball 
high on my blade and I didn't think it was going to get over a bunker. I said 
after I hit it, 'Fly miles.' " 
</P>
<P>
Benepe, who had started from the 10th hole, was 4 under par after his ace. 
However, he took a double bogey at the ninth hole when he 3-putted from 15 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
So Benepe, 25, from Sheridan, Wyo., had to settle for a 2-under-par 69. 
</P>
<P>
"The hole in one is like being the high scorer for your team in basketball, but 
the team loses," Benepe said. MAL FLORENCE

UNION LOSES COURT FIGHT WITH COUNTY TO ORGANIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A labor union's fight to organize and secure a collective bargaining agreement 
for 50,000 home health care workers, who are paid by the state but supervised 
by Los Angeles County officials, lost a crucial round Thursday when a judge 
ruled that the workers cannot be considered county employees. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Warren Deering used those grounds to deny a legal claim by 
the Service Employees International Union Local 434 that the county should be 
forced to negotiate a labor contract with the low-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Deering agreed with county officials that they are merely 
administering a state program and that the county is under no obligation to 
negotiate a wage and benefits pact. Home care workers are supervised and their 
pay levels are determined by the county, but they are paid by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a total victory for the county," said Donovan Main, assistant county 
counsel, after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoping for New Ruling 
</P>
<P>
Richard McCracken, an attorney for SEIU Local 434, said the union hopes to 
persuade Deering to reconsider his decision, arguing that he had overlooked the 
fact that the county controls virtually every aspect of the home care program 
except signing paychecks. But he admitted he's not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge can issue a different ruling, although we're not banking on that," 
said McCracken, who added that the union is considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Deering said that since the Legislature budgets funds for the In 
Home Supportive Services program, the state may be in a better position to 
determine what additional benefits are needed by home care workers. But he 
refrained from deciding if the workers could organize and join a union as state 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the county home care workers, who make the minimum wage of $4.25 an 
hour with no benefits, are middle-aged minority women. Working an average of 25 
hours a week under county supervision, they help elderly and disabled clients 
with household and personal chores. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, in addition to the court battle, the home care workers 
had turned to mass demonstrations, picketing and public protests at the 
downtown Hall of Administration to press their case. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's ruling, a spokesman said the union, which has obtained 
authorization cards from 15,000 workers, will continue to improve the workers' 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever this decision says, the union will continue to fight for important 
issues to home care workers, like trying to get health insurance and fighting 
state budget cuts in home care services," said Kirk Adams, chief union 
organizer.

 COUNTY REPORTS 513 MEASLES CASES IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County last year reported 513 measles cases, nearly 18% of the 
nation's total of 2,933, the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday 
in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Two patients, both babies, died. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC report said that nearly 78% of the cases where the ethnic group was 
known were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The measles outbreak, which peaked last summer, prompted the county Department 
of Health Services to reduce the minimum age for measles vaccination from 15 
months to 12 months and to intensify its efforts to vaccinate preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
County residents may arrange for free measles vaccinations by calling any 
clinic of the Department of Health Services or by calling the department's 
immunization unit at (213) 974-7937.

 BUILDER WINES, DINES WOULD-BE NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodland Hills builder Jack Spound invited a whole neighborhood to a fancy 
hotel dinner to line up backing for his controversial $150-million office 
project at the edge of Warner Center. It is the subject of a crucial Los 
Angeles Planning Commission hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
Spound asked all 850 members of the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce to stop 
by the hotel for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres and to talk about supporting him 
at the hearing. But foes of the proposed development criticized his 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said the Wednesday night dinner was a way of rewarding neighboring 
residents of the Warner Hills condominium development who have backed his 
"Warner Ridge" project, which he hopes to build in partnership with Johnson Wax 
Development Corp. The condominium dwellers were treated to cocktails and a 
dinner of veal with wild mushroom sauce and filet of salmon in the grand 
ballroom of the Warner Center Marriott hotel. About 60 people were expected; 34 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider it ethical," said Robert Gross, a vice president of the 
Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, whose neighborhood was not invited to 
the dinner. "The wining and dining of selected local residents shows this 
developer will stop at nothing to achieve his goal."

 JUDGE SUSPENDED OVER TICKET CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday ordered Municipal Judge Charles Boags of 
Beverly Hills suspended without pay after his conviction on a charge of 
improperly dismissing parking ticket fines. 
</P>
<P>
Boags, 59, was found guilty by a jury of the misdemeanor charge of suspending 
fines on more than 200 parking tickets issued to cars registered to himself, 
his son and his son's friends. The suspension will last while Boags appeals his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was ordered on a request by the state Commission on Judicial 
Performance. 
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution allows suspension of a judge convicted of any felony, or 
of a misdemeanor involving "moral turpitude," a term that refers to dishonesty 
or morally objectionable conduct. The commission said Boags' crime involved 
moral turpitude.

 CONDOR COURTSHIPS BLOOMING AT ZOOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Biologists trying to save California condors from extinction say the big birds 
are courting in two zoos. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen California condors at the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 others at the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido are the only remaining members of the 
endangered vulture species. Their 9 1/2-foot wingspans make them North 
America's largest land birds. 
</P>
<P>
Courtship started in early January among four pairs of condors in Escondido and 
two pairs in Los Angeles, and scientists hope they will produce enough chicks 
to allow some to be reintroduced to the wild in five to 10 years, said Joseph 
Dowhan, the federal agency's condor recovery coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But in an experiment to practice for the eventual release of California 
condors, three Andean condors freed Dec. 17 are being pestered by tail-grabbing 
ravens and divebombing eagles, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are pretty amusing," U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Teresa 
Nichols said. "The condors handle it very passively. They give them (the 
ravens) a dirty look, turn their backs and then start eating again."

MY BEAT : MEMORY COMES TAPPING BACK FOR OBIT WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Blume, Blume recently completed an internship with The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was working on an asbestos story one day recently when an editor's message 
beeped into my computer terminal: 
</P>
<P>
 I think we may need an obit on dance teacher etc. Ted Howard. Can you please 
see if library has anything in files on him? 
</P>
<P>
 I checked. The Times library found nothing. Howard appeared in no reference 
book or dance publication the librarian could find. And The Times had never set 
this man's name in type. 
</P>
<P>
I made a hasty check of available dance professionals. They didn't know the old 
tap dancer. Nor would Howard's personal files, untouched since his long 
illness, assist my attempt to measure the man. Howard's friend and landlord 
said the lanky, Canadian-born dancer penciled in only the first names of 
students. Thus, his friend couldn't contact them about the funeral, and I 
couldn't ask them about Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, I had to forget about writing anything on him -- except for one 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered Ted Howard. One of the man's untraceable students was I. 
</P>
<P>
On a trip to Los Angeles, at least 10 years ago, I took a series of classes 
with Howard, then nearing 70 years old. The memory of that brief contact rushed 
back as I listened to his friend, Barbara Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Perry had called The Times about Howard's death, saying there was more to him 
than a paid death notice could impart. He deserved to be remembered, she said, 
echoing the sentiment of anyone who has lost someone they care about. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, with her mother, had owned one of Hollywood's most important dance 
studios and rehearsal halls in years past. People like Jimmy Cagney and Agnes 
DeMille rehearsed or taught there. Ted Howard, she said, had managed Perry's 
studios and taught tap there for about 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"That was his entire life. He taught all day long," she said, describing 
someone who elected to train stars, not be one. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't go on auditions to Broadway shows. He preferred the safety of the 
rehearsal hall." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she emphasized, "he was a beautiful, gorgeous dancer." She recalled when 
members of the visiting Kirov Ballet, rehearsing at Perry's, would pause 
outside Howard's studio to watch him dance and teach. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, during my lessons, I remembered Howard laughing as he talked of 
going to movie studios and letting directors film him dancing -- from the waist 
down. The film editors would then intersperse shots of his feet with takes of 
the lead actor's face. No moviegoers need ever know. And it wouldn't be 
Howard's light feet that made their imprint in the Chinese Theatre's cement. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story Howard would not have remembered himself these last few years. For 
not long after that lesson series, Alzheimer's disease began its death crawl 
over his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Howard stopped teaching. A new generation of students learned elsewhere. And 
even his many friends either lost track of him or stopped visiting when he 
evidenced no memory of them. The tangible recollections also disintegrated. The 
site of Perry's Studios is now a parking lot at the Hollywood Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
But some remember. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Hadsell, who owns Capezio's in Hollywood, recalls Howard's special-order 
tap shoes. The finest black character oxfords with maple heels and Morgan taps. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Meg Wilson remembers that Howard played the vaudeville circuit in New 
York, Chicago and Las Vegas with a partner named Larry before settling on 
teaching. "Ted and Larry had one of the most spectacular acts," she said, "lots 
of taps, flips, splits and slides, extremely high kicks. His style was 
ballet-style actually, with close floor taps." 
</P>
<P>
As an instructor, Wilson said, "I can't believe what a generous, giving person 
he was. He'd help you with a step. He'd give you a routine. You never could 
quite pay him back. He didn't want anything." 
</P>
<P>
A man who lived and worked near the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame, Howard 
never stepped across his own name. 
</P>
<P>
There would be no star for Ted Howard. And no headlines. But I remembered him. 
Picking up the paper, I turned to the death notices -- to read the names I 
didn't recognize.

JUDGE CONVICTS 31 IN ILLEGAL PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION WAS HELD ON VA LAND OVER U.S. EL SALVADOR POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-one activists opposed to the U.S. policy in El Salvador were convicted 
Thursday of holding an unauthorized demonstration on Veterans Administration 
property in West Los Angeles, despite their contention that it was necessary to 
prevent the breaking of higher law. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann, who heard the one-day trial without a jury, 
allowed the defendants to avail themselves of the so-called necessity defense, 
although defense attorneys Arthur Goldberg and Gail Ivens said they believed 
that it was the first time a federal court in California has permitted it. 
</P>
<P>
He sentenced each of them to pay a $50 fine or devote 25 hours to community 
service, observing that it might be appropriate for them to give that service 
to organizations helping Latin American refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 members of Pledge of Resistance, a national organization that claims a 
membership of more than 90,000, were arrested last Oct. 15 after they refused 
to leave the National Guard armory on federal property. 
</P>
<P>
They were among about 500 activists marching that day to protest U.S. support 
for the government of El Salvador, which they accuse of death-squad 
assassinations and other human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Sufficient' 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Martin J. Murphy contended that the necessity defense was 
not applicable, because the defendants were not in danger nor was civil 
disobedience their only recourse. 
</P>
<P>
"Mere disagreement with the process is not sufficient for the necessity 
defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy asked each of the defendants who testified whether he or she was in 
personal danger at the armory and whether the orders to leave were clear. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, they freely admitted trespassing and defying orders to 
disperse, declaring their conviction that American policy in El Salvador and 
the rest of Central America is the greater sin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that what we're doing in El Salvador -- murdering innocent people -- 
puts us all in danger," insisted Cynthia Anderson Barker, a UCLA Latin American 
studies student who said she has worked for eight years with Lutheran Church 
Social Services, helping Latin American refugees obtain legal aid. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was convinced that Salvadorans have been discriminated against in 
requests for asylum here and that members of Congress have shown "an incredible 
ignorance . . . on what's going on in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
She said that shortly before the West Los Angeles demonstration, she visited 
the Central American country and saw soldiers prepare to shoot a group of 
protesting students, then settle for beating them when they realized there were 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had no choice but to join the civil disobedience," she testified. "If 
I don't, I'm really guilty of murder, because I'm not doing anything to stop 
the policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked to Leave 
</P>
<P>
Army Maj. Jeffrey Kramer testified that the demonstrators were asked to leave 
because their presence was disruptive. He conceded on cross-examination, 
however, that no one did anything physical to interfere with training. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the magistrate said he had to find the defendants guilty, despite 
their sincere belief in their cause, because they failed to meet the 
requirements of a necessity defense. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was filled with supporters of the defendants. During the morning, 
they held a demonstration outside the Federal Courthouse, displaying three 
coffins to symbolize Herbert Anaya, Imelda Medrano and Rigoberto Orellana, 
three anti-Salvadoran-government figures they said were murderered by rightist 
death squads.

MORALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 14, I picked up my Times and glanced at the headlines: "GAO Cites Fraud 
in Failures of S&amp;Ls," "Goetz Goes to Jail," "Disabled -- Easy Target for 
Crimes," "Gangs Shed Loyalty in Drug Trade's Spread." 
</P>
<P>
Seemed a lot of bad news, but I kept on scanning. Would you believe it, every 
single article on the front page was about crime, deceit, immorality, illegal 
conduct or suspected infractions of the law! Even the one piece of 
international news was about illegal action. 
</P>
<P>
Could The Times be playing up crime and immorality? This seems unlikely. Was 
Jan. 13 a bad day, which made Jan. 14's news atypical? Or could it mean that an 
awful lot of the newsworthy events occurring in the Southland and in the United 
States are immoral, illegal or suspect? Certainly, a foreign visitor who picked 
up The Times might think so. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, shouldn't this concentrated dose of reported crime, deceit, 
immoral and illegal behavior make us wonder whether a new social trend has 
reared its ugly head? Perhaps it's a warning that we'd better pay a lot more 
attention to the morality and legality of our behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Are you listening, President George Bush?

THE MONITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was interested in a Times column that offered one writer's view of 
discussions surrounding the Christian Science Monitor -- and her effort to 
express a concern and care for the paper ("A World Newspaper Falls on Parochial 
Bottom-Lines," by Cynthia Parsons, Opinion, Jan. 15). But the viewpoint she put 
forward left in its wake several mistaken notions about our church. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Scientists certainly don't feel they lead "a life of compromise with 
the world." Far from it! With a noticeable amount of vigor they are bringing a 
full and vital life of spirituality to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Also the writer protests that the church directors and trustees are 
"politically ultraconservative" and merely "bureaucrats" who have never "read 
and loved the paper." Sometimes we all hastily say things that, on reflection, 
we would say differently. Actually, these are individuals who have committed 
their lives to the church's ministry of spiritual healing and are serving in 
their posts for the very reason that they have loved the Monitor and every 
other activity of the church. 
</P>
<P>
I've observed with interest the forebearance and patience expressed by church 
officers as critics have their day in the press. In the long run I'm sure 
everyone will agree that Christian qualities expressed by all people who love 
the Monitor will best contribute to helping fulfill its mission to "injure no 
man, but to bless all mankind."

'COLD WAR IS NOT OVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jerry Falwells, the Richard Vigueries, the Jesse Helmses, the Norman 
Podhoretzes, the cold warriors, the Republican right-wingers who voted for 
George Bush and their Democratic counterparts are all dancing in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
And well they should be. For in the very first hours of his Administration our 
new President has brought joy to the hearts of the members of the American 
political right-wing and has established his credentials as one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the President's inauguration, his security adviser says in so 
many words, and surely not without the President's blessing, "the Cold War 
(with the Soviet Union) is not over." 
</P>
<P>
Why must the nation be kept in constant fear that peace with the Soviet Union 
might break out? No one with any sense suggests that Gorbachev's "peace 
offensive" is motivated by anything but his belief that peaceful coexistence 
with the United States is in the best interests of the Soviet Union. But does 
not that objective of normal, peaceful relations between the two countries 
coincide with the best interests of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan in his last year in office recognized this very fact and, to 
his credit, helped move it along despite the cries of the right in his own 
party. Why then, if not to satisfy that right, does President Bush, through the 
rhetoric of one of his chief advisers, take such a giant step backwards as 
evidenced by Scowcroft's ominous words? 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, his first working day in office, President Bush, in the words of 
Dan Rather, "goes to the jugular on abortion" by urging the Supreme Court to 
reverse its 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision which permitted legalized 
abortion. He suggests "adoption instead of abortion." Has the President ever 
considered the number of simply teen-age pregnancies, let alone the total 
number of all unwanted pregnancies, every year as compared with the number of 
adoptions in our country during the same period? Any such comparison would 
immediately prove the total inadequacy of adoption as a solution to the problem 
of unwanted childbearing. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, President Bush has, indeed, hit the ground running. It is too bad that he 
is running backward, not forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's national security adviser's statement that "the Cold War is 
not over" makes me wonder whether or not the Cold War warriors are in the 
saddle once more in the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
If the majority of the American and Soviet peoples are basically for an end to 
the arms race and peaceful coexistence, why are Scowcroft and Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) afraid of Gorbachev's "peace offensive?" 
</P>
<P>
Is it because they don't want to decrease the profits made by the 
industrial-military complex in armaments appropriations, even though this would 
mean a chance to decrease the budget deficit and appropriate more money for 
housing, health and education?

THE TOWER PREDICAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Tower, President Bush's defense secretary-designate, has assured the 
Senate Armed Services committee that he has no drinking problem and that he is 
a man of "discipline" who now limits his alcohol consumption to the odd glass 
of wine. Ordinarily this would probably suffice to answer the charges, made 
most recently before the committee by one conservative witness, that Tower on 
occasion had been seen drunk in public. It might further be expected that the 
committee would give special weight to Tower's denial since he is both a former 
senator and a former member of the same panel that must recommend on his 
nomination. Approval of Tower could still come fairly soon. For the moment, 
though, a vote has been deferred so that the committee can pursue "additional 
information." What this suggests is that the Tower nomination may be in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The exact nature of any such trouble is open to speculation. Some committee 
members clearly remain bothered that Tower was paid more than $750,000 between 
1986 and 1988 for giving advice to six companies that did a lot of business 
with the Defense Department. That lucrative consulting role followed 
immediately on Tower's brief service as a delegate to the 
strategic-arms-reduction talks, raising concerns about the appearance -- if not 
necessarily the fact -- that he cashed in on insider information. Other 
members, as their public questioning showed, are disturbed about the 
allegations and rumors concerning Tower's drinking and womanizing -- the latter 
an accusation also made in divorce-court proceedings by his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
Tower concedes that he was a heavy drinker in the past. In open session before 
the committee he says that he has put that behind him, adding that he is fully 
aware that the responsibilities of the defense secretary's job make temperance 
essential. Certainly few members of the Senate would insist on abstinence as a 
qualification for high office. Certainly, too, Tower may indeed have overcome 
his earlier drinking problem through the self discipline he now cites. If so, 
he deserves respect. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, it is not just proper but imperative that the Armed 
Services Committee and the full Senate satisfy themselves that any doubts about 
Tower's ethics, sobriety and behavior have been resolved. The importance and 
sensitivity of the defense secretary's job leave no room for uncertainties; in 
times of crisis and stress the President and the armed forces must be able to 
expect that he will be reachable, clearheaded and effective. The time to learn 
about potential short comings is before a confirmation vote is taken. Afterward 
it may be too late.

BEYOND PIETER BOTHA, A DAY OF RECKONING?; 
</P>
<P>
A WIDER WINDOW FOR CHANGE MAY OPEN IN THE DIRECTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of President Pieter W. Botha's stroke in January and his 
resignation Thursday as the leader of the ruling National Party, South Africans 
are acclimatizing themselves to the prospect of having a new leader. And change 
at the top could create a new atmosphere of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Whites, the minority who hold power, are excited and expectant. A new leader 
could mean, in their terms, important shifts in policy and life style -- even 
touching on their survival. 
</P>
<P>
For blacks, a new white leader, coming inevitably from the ranks of Afrikaner 
nationalism and committed in one form or other to segregation, will be a 
distinction without a difference. The security forces' rule over their lives 
will be the continuing reality. Many in the outside world probably incline to 
this view, too. 
</P>
<P>
The truth, I think, lies somewhere between the perceptions of whites and 
blacks. A new political situation could arise overnight. A South Africa without 
Botha could be a more exciting place to live in, offering a wider window for 
change -- in the direction of social justice. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, recuperating after what was termed a "mild" stroke, is near the end 
of his rule. His resignation from the party leadership is the first step toward 
total retirement. The race to succeed him is on. The narrow election of 
Transvaal leader F. W. de Klerk as party leader in Botha's place makes him the 
favorite to take over when Botha goes, though meanwhile he will be on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, critical problems are building up -- like a new liberal clamor to 
have the Group Areas Act, which enforces residential segregation, repealed in 
view of a right-wing campaign to hound people of color out of homes bought or 
rented in "white" areas in disregard of the law; the delicate, problem-ridden 
path to independence in Namibia; the vital question of when to call a general 
election, which by law must be held by March next year, and how to deal with 
widespread allegations of official corruption. These problems have to be 
tackled soon, and with resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's era has notched up some success in Africa. However hostile the world in 
general has been, he has gotten on better with African countries than might 
have been expected, resulting in a thriving but clandestine trade with many of 
them. And he has brought Namibia to the brink of internationally supervised 
independence, foreshadowing an end to the Angolan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Internally, his success has been more modest. He has drawn some mixed-blood 
"colored" and Asian people into his new constitutional scheme for limited 
power-sharing, and, at the time of his stroke, he was preparing a new attempt 
to draw in blacks -- something always thwarted by the African National 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's South Africa has been racked by racial unrest, which alternately 
simmers and surfaces. Government repression has been greater than under any of 
his predecessors. Black statelets sporting "independence," the government's 
quid pro quo for denial of full-scale rights for blacks, have progressively 
become rickety, corrupt, warring regions reminiscent of the worst parts of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The South African economy has suffered double-digit inflation for more than a 
dozen years, unemployment is high enough to threaten social peace, and a recent 
Carnegie-backed study found a staggering degree of abject black poverty. This, 
for a well-endowed country, is indictment. 
</P>
<P>
As members of Parliament gather in Cape Town for the session that opens today 
-- with Botha suddenly wrenched from their midst, though not far away taking 
recuperative walks around his garden, there is much speculation about a 
successor. He has held the reins of government so tightly that there is no 
crown prince in the wings. His style has been highly "personal" -- presidential 
rather than committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a new untested person will emerge who will have to form an early 
alliance with the military if he wants to rule this almost ungovernable 
country. The military could even take over, de facto if not de jure. Yet 
military options have their limitations, as experience in South America and 
elsewhere has shown. Sooner rather than later a new leader will face the 
awesome choice: Either broaden the base of government by offering meaningful 
rights to blacks or risk a full-scale race war. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing backlash to meaningful reform would be severe. The right could 
even win a future general election. But that, too, could hasten the day of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the steam has gone out of white South Africa. The hegemony 
of Afrikanerdom, so skillfully forged in the 1930s and '40s, has given way to 
political division and class differences. Factors like Afrikaner urbanization 
and the growth of Afrikaner business have cracked the monolith. The police and 
army still guarantee white security, but the ideological self-confidence of 
past years has declined. Few young whites can realistically look forward to 
drawing pensions in a white-dominated South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, by their numbers and their labor (if not by guerrilla war), are showing 
increasing clout. Despite repression and denial of rights, there is a 
resilience and a determination to govern, with or without white cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Someone, sometime, somehow will have to break the news to white South Africans 
that their elaborate system of patronage and privilege, backed by the security 
forces, must give way to social and political justice for all. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's moving from the scene could bring that day closer.

A LOST ART; 
</P>
<P>
IT SEEMS REPONDEZ S'IL VOUS PLAIT HAS GONE THE WAY OF WHITE GLOVES 
</P>

<P>
The party is set. The invitations are out. All that's left is waiting for the 
RSVPs to come in. 
</P>
<P>
So you wait. 
</P>
<P>
And wait. 
</P>
<P>
And no one calls. 
</P>
<P>
It's become a fact of life in this car phone-fax generation that answering an 
invitation is a lost art. Ask any host, party planner or etiquette expert what 
the rate of return is and he or she will say poor. Very poor. Many already have 
bid RIP to the RSVP. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's the No. 1 complaint I get from people," says consultant Judi 
Kaufman, who is based in Beverly Hills and teaches business etiquette seminars 
nationwide. "From discussions I've had with people from all over, I think that 
California especially, and the L.A. area, is most seriously negligent in that 
area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informal Kind of Style 
</P>
<P>
Why do so many fail to respond to repondez, s'il vous plait? 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a feeling here that etiquette is not important, that we have a 
free, informal kind of style," Kaufman offers. "But finally, I'm hearing from 
people who used to laugh that I was doing etiquette training, saying that they 
give parties and half the people who said they would show up actually did." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Keischnick, a prominent social figure and former executive president of 
the Music Center Blue Ribbon, observes: "I think people in Los Angeles are very 
busy, and sometimes they'll postpone responding to an invitation until they're 
certain of their plans. I think sometimes there are conflicts they're trying to 
resolve, if there are two big events on one night. We all get so much junk 
mail. And some people are really careless. If you've never been involved in 
planning an event, you might not realize that you need to know if someone is or 
isn't coming." 
</P>
<P>
But says Charlotte Ford, an author and etiquette columnist: "I think it's just 
outrageous. Everybody's busy, no matter what age, and . . . it takes two 
seconds to RSVP. It's so simple, with enclosed response cards, but people don't 
seem to respect even that. I think it's just bad manners." 
</P>
<P>
Not getting responses to an invitation can be disastrous for hosts, who must 
plan details such as catering, seating and other often expensive party 
arrangements. Often it means calling invitees to find out whether they are 
attending -- a daunting prospect with a large guest list. Every party giver can 
tell tales of guests failing to RSVP, then showing up at the door with one 
guest -- or several -- and expecting the host to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
A return to manners was heralded several years ago, as etiquette columns sprang 
up faster than people could set out finger bowls. But either interest in social 
graces has waned, or people no longer think the old rules apply. 
</P>
<P>
Keischnick reports that she gets "a very good response" to invitations for 
private parties she and husband Bill give. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as fund-raisers," she adds, "it's really tough. I just co-chaired 
WinterFest (an annual fund-raiser for the Music Center's education division), 
and you get down to two days before the event and you haven't heard from 
people, so you have to get on the phone and start calling. You have to give the 
caterer some idea of how many people will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all guilty of not replying at one time or another," she says, adding 
that she and her husband each month receive about 20 invitations to private and 
charitable functions. "But I happened to grow up in an era when my mother 
taught me that it was really essential to RSVP. It was ingrained in me, and I 
taught my kids that. But I sometimes think that maybe that's not being stressed 
as much." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman finds a recent renewed interest in parents sending their children to 
etiquette classes. But often those same parents fail to follow the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are so speeded up, you almost don't know what the rules are even if you 
had the time to follow them," she says. "Etiquette really evolves: Thirty years 
ago there were hard-and-fast rules; now we have to almost make them up as we go 
along." 
</P>
<P>
Etiquette rules for car phones (Kaufman suggests not making outgoing calls with 
a passenger in the car, and keeping incoming calls short) and fax machines 
(don't always expect an instantaneous reply to a faxed message) are definitely 
new rules for the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But some traditions still apply, like the thank-you note and the RSVP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Listeners 
</P>
<P>
Paul Cooper, senior vice president and general manager of Atlantic Records on 
the West Coast, planned a recent listening party at Ed Debevic's restaurant in 
honor of label artist Debbie Gibson's new album. 
</P>
<P>
He sent out 500 invitations and received 400 replies -- not a bad percentage. 
But that still left 100 guests not accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain people we'd like to have, people in the radio and movie 
industries," Cooper says. "Unfortunately, you can't always trust the mail, so 
normally I make it a policy to zero in on these people with a phone call. But 
some people get the invitation and forget to RSVP, and then just show up, or 
show up with five people, and we have to say we can't accommodate them. So our 
best protection is picking up the phone. It's better to be protected than have 
a problem with the fire marshal over overcrowding." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is familiar with the I'm-too-important-to-RSVP attitude: "They think 
it's because of who they are, that they can just show up. If someone calls 
ahead and asks to bring an extra guest, then I'm always accommodating, unless 
it's a very small venue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fanatically Correct 
</P>
<P>
He credits his good manners to his former employers, the late philanthropist 
David E. Bright and his wife, Dolly. "I fortunately was taught protocol by 
them," he explains, adding that he "carried that over to Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper prides himself on RSVPing to every invitation he receives, whether it's 
for a private party or an unsolicited invitation to a fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
Charity fund-raisers have their own rules when it comes to RSVPs, experts say. 
Few planners expect a quick response from a majority of the invitees since the 
invitation is also a solicitation for money. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman contends that an unsolicited invitation to a charity event that's part 
of a blanket mailing (a printed label is a dead giveaway) doesn't require an 
RSVP. "That's very different from receiving a hand-written note." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invitational Nuances 
</P>
<P>
Ford concurs. "If it's a typed letter with a stamped signature, I don't answer 
it," she says. "I get three or four of those a day. If there's a note from 
someone I know (on a planning committee), then I make a small contribution and 
write a letter back, explaining if I can't attend. And if I'm on a committee 
that's planning an event, then I'll write a note to someone." 
</P>
<P>
Personal notes are used by most fund-raisers as a way to ensure a better 
response from guests. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper uses Mailgrams for company-hosted parties. 
</P>
<P>
"You tend to get a better response," he explains. "Normally it's the first 
thing people open. We started using them as soon as the Post Office came out 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Unger doesn't even wait for guests to RSVP to events she plans. A partner 
at Unger/Thomas, a public relations firm for political and nonprofit 
organizations, Unger is involved in planning numerous parties, from intimate 
cocktail receptions to hotel ballroom bashes. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost don't expect people to RSVP because you're asking them for money," 
she says. "Generally, people don't respond unless they are called first and 
solicited. . . . Frankly, the only trick I know for things like this is just 
phone, phone, phone. Even once they've RSVP'd and sent in their money, I always 
follow up a few days before to make sure they're going to use their tickets. 
The worst thing in the world is an empty table."

BEHIND THE WHEEL: VOLVO 740GL DOESN'T RUN OUT OF LUXURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Volvo, in a classic of Scandinavian abstraction, compares its changeless cars 
to wooden clothespins. Others liken the pace, elegance and high technology of 
the Volvo to the Zippo lighter. Or the Douglas DC-3. 
</P>
<P>
And when automotive magazines consider the elderly, stately, perennial, tweedy 
and thoroughly rational Volvo, it usually is with a wink in passing. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the buff books are interested only in what is new and hot and this, 
frankly, is a pedestrian car," Volvo spokesman Fred Hammond explained. 
</P>
<P>
The mundane under discussion is the scholarly 1989 Volvo 740GL. It has not been 
test-driven by Mother Earth News, let alone Road &amp; Track. "They'll test a 
16-valve or a turbo or something that is new, new, new . . . but this is a 
variant of an existing model and to them, the car is old hat." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the old hat be a new Stetson or a crisp jipijapa Panama 
-- well, apathy may be seen as tacit acceptance of the Volvo's reliance, 
dependability and quality. After all, when was the last time Consumer Reports 
felt it necessary to rate Acme clothespins? 
</P>
<P>
Hammond sees Volvo as "purveyors of a high quality, safe, dependable car . . . 
it may not be glamorous, but it's top value for the money." 
</P>
<P>
High quality? The 740GL has it right down to power-assisted disc brakes on all 
four wheels, the fit and finish of a Chubb safe, and the ultimate decadence of 
heated seat cushions -- here and forever known as Swedish bun warmers. 
</P>
<P>
Safe? It's built like a brick ice house and when examining National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration statistics on crash-worthiness, look for the 
Swedish-built Volvo somewhere between backhoes and armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Dependable? More solid than Mats Wilander's backhand. A recent analysis 
established the average life expectancy of the Volvo at 15.6 years. Therefore, 
the 740GL's resale value will not be a concern until sometime in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Value? This four-door 740GL (also available as a station wagon) sells for 
$20,555 including most luxury necessities and with only two available extras: 
an anti-lock brake system and driver-side air bag. 
</P>
<P>
The car, mechanically and visually, is indeed a clear offspring of the Volvo 
740GLE sedans and station wagons that were first introduced in 1985. Yet it's a 
refinement that was produced by subtracting options and fixtures from the 
original, not by the standard industrial practice of adding turbocharged bells 
and electronic whistles. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, instead of a price hike for a new and improved product, Volvo has 
come into the model year with a hefty decrease in the cost of the tested and 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
The need for revision, Hammond explained, was created by an unplanned break in 
the continuity of the Volvo line. The company's trainer has long been the 
popular 240 series starting at $18,000 and change. Next in succession was the 
740GLE, the entry point to the luxury line, all leather and up-market niceties, 
with a basic sticker of $23,000 and then some. 
</P>
<P>
So between the 240s and the 740s -- thanks to a gradual meld of inflation, the 
dollar's dive against the krona and consumer reluctance to pay any more for the 
bread and butter 240s -- existed a price spread bigger than the Kattegat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Step-Down 
</P>
<P>
"We had a $5,000 gap and that's a pretty big hole these days," Hammond said. 
Especially when the hole contains such tempting vehicles as the Nissan Maxima, 
Toyota Cressida and the Mazda 929. "So we looked at the existing 740GLE and 
decided to de-accessorize the car down and call it the 740GL." 
</P>
<P>
The step-down from GLE (Grand Luxury Elegance) to GL (Grand Luxury) involved 
simple removal of the superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
Upholstery has been returned to fabric in the true belief that only cows have 
any real need to travel with leather seats. Sunroof controls and seat 
adjustments are back to manual. So are the side mirrors. Aluminum wheels now 
are steel wheels and to open the trunk requires getting out of the car first. 
</P>
<P>
The net result is much the same motor car for $5,000 less -- but with 
absolutely no feeling of driving a stripped, shadow of former excellence. 
</P>
<P>
The 740GL comes uncluttered by pretensions of high performance. It is powered 
by a Cro-Magnon, four-cylinder, 2.3-liter engine developing only 114 
horsepower. The 0-60 time is 10 seconds. Top speed is 108 miles per hour. And 
that's slower than any new Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Volvo Tradition 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, surprisingly, it all seems more than adequate and credit that to 
another Volvo tradition -- superb engineering of the total automotive package, 
a concert of engine, suspension, transmission, brakes and steering. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, in any maneuver, from slow cornering to rapid lane changes, the 
740GL calmly redirects its feet and politely repositions its weight into flat, 
steady and dependable turns. 
</P>
<P>
Handling is not as frisky as the BMW nor does the 740GL have that panzerwagen 
drag of the Mercedes. The tighter this car turns, it seems, the lighter becomes 
the steering until parallel parking is a two-stop two-step. 
</P>
<P>
And with a 70-0-m.p.h. braking distance of 176 feet, the 740GL clearly is the 
best of any car slithering to a stop anywhere in its class. 
</P>
<P>
Although ponderous at top and bottom ends, the car has acceptable midrange 
acceleration as long as a driver stays on the power curve and ahead of traffic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is yet another testimonial to Volvo's blessed refusal to pad along 
behind the high-tech herd that so often mistakes change for progress. 
</P>
<P>
In the 740, all controls are self-explanatory. Gauges with great big dials and 
nice fat needles. A radio with real knobs that turn clockwise. Lights and 
wipers on stalks and switches as God and Assar Gabrielsson, the father of 
Volvo, intended them to be. It's all so wonderfully comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home and Hearth 
</P>
<P>
Externally, the lines of the 740GL are as straight as Volvo has been drawing 
its edges since 1927. Styling angles remain large and the plane of the rear 
window, unfortunately, is almost vertical. Corners are barely rounded and the 
overall feel is that of home, hearth and a pair of rubber-soled wing tips. 
</P>
<P>
Therein, possibly, lies the full charm of any Volvo. They are secure cars. They 
are rational, sensible cars producing no surprises. They are so stolid, so 
tolerant it is virtually impossible to drive a Volvo badly -- and short of 
hiring a chauffeur, that's as easy as motoring gets. 
</P>
<P>
Volvo also excels at expensive touches within even its inexpensive vehicles 
such as the 740GL. 
</P>
<P>
Front door sills have de-misters so that on clammy days there will always be 
side-mirror vision. The visor mirror is illuminated. There's a button on the 
gearshift to activate a top-gear lockdown that prevents the automatic 
transmission from surging on undulating roads. And a windshield clip for 
holding maps, parking stubs and shopping lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Volvo believes that if you are uncomfortable, you can't drive right," Hammond 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Then that would explain. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that would explain the bun warmers."

CHILLS, THRILLS AT LACMA PREVIEW PARTY

<P>
It was a good night for Gronk. A very good night. 
</P>
<P>
Gronk, the artist, who goes by only one name, was savoring the irony of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, of course, he said, it was an honor to see his paintings hanging inside 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. But it wasn't exactly the first time he 
had shown there. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1972," the East L.A. artist explained, "I came in the middle of the night 
and defaced all the entrances and exits of the museum with spray paint. At that 
time no Latino artist had ever shown here. I signed the whole museum as my art 
piece. Now they're saying, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stellar Supporters 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's preview reception for "Hispanic Art in the United States, 30 
Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors" brought out the usual stellar, sparkling 
crowd of museum supporters, but there was something different about this 
particular opening. Maybe it was the combination of black tie and black beans 
on the menu. Or the sounds of Afro-Cuban music (with a slight jazz overtone) 
beating through the Times Mirror Central Court. Or the elaborately painted 
chrome yellow 1950 Chevy low rider -- the ultimate custom car, if you will -- 
parked at the entrance of the Robert O. Anderson Building. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people didn't know quite what to make of that car. Should they laugh? 
Should they try to interpret it? Or what? "Do you have a card?" George Gradow, 
who is married to actress Barbi Benton, asked ponytailed artist Gilbert Sanchez 
Lujan, who had entitled his art work "Our Family Car" because it really was 
before it became an exhibit. "We just bought a ranch in Aspen," Gradow said, 
"and that piece would be faaaabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the gallery: 
</P>
<P>
Sculptor Robert Graham, also ponytailed, posed for a photographer in front of a 
sculpture, a nude woman, entitled "Fountain Figure 1." His date, who is his 
ex-wife, Anne Kresl, said it was she. 
</P>
<P>
Painter Luis Stand of Brooklyn, New York, making his first visit to Los 
Angeles, was asked for his opinion of the museum. "I like the idea that it's 
located on an area of -- what do you call it? -- tar pits. It's very peculiar, 
a prehistoric site in the middle of the city," he mused. So he and artists 
Rolando Briseno, also of Brooklyn, and Rudy Fernandez, of Santa Fe, caught a 
tour of the La Brea tar pits that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Gil de Montes was complaining that one of his erotic paintings was 
removed earlier from the show, organized by the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, 
which has been touring for a year and a half. "I was told the owner of the 
piece wanted it back. But I'm the owner." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Sanchez Lujan opened the trunk of the Chevy, pulled out some crayons 
and drew chili peppers on curator Howard Fox's bow tie. "Gilbert's compulsive," 
Fox said. "Whenever he sees an unadorned surface he has to make it glow." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the crowd, collectors Morris and Rita Pynoos admitted that except 
for the firmly established sculptures of Robert Graham, they weren't familiar 
with any of the art on display. "It's very important to know what's going on 
besides the right names in the art world," Rita remarked. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't they look a little like the German Expressionists?" Morris pondered. 
</P>
<P>
Observing from the sidelines, Steven Lavine, the new president of CalArts, 
said: "I think people are more attentive tonight than I've ever seen them. It's 
work they don't know how to look at, so they have to look. There's a higher 
ratio of people inside looking than outside eating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Cold Wind 
</P>
<P>
True, but outside, a cold wind whipped through the reception area. Furs, trench 
coats, even long underwear (Hollywood Reporter publisher Tichi Wilkerson 
Kassel's solution underneath her Oscar de la Renta beaded jacket and trousers) 
were the order of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
As for the youngest art connoisseurs, they were kept warm by their mothers. 
Janis Dinwiddie, head of the museum's special events office, cuddled her 
2-month-old son, Tommy Steenrod, while Stephanie Barron, curator of Twentieth 
Century art, snuggled 10-week-old Max Rifkind-Barron, whom, she noted, was 
making his museum debut. Both babies heeded the dress code and wore tiny 
tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
"This show is from my department," Barron said, "and I want to start him 
early."

DELL'OLIO ON POLITICS AND SPRING STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis Dell'Olio, designer for Anne Klein, was wrapped in a navy cashmere 
double-breasted suit and Ray-Ban sunglasses, sitting by the pool of the Bel-Air 
Hotel, contemplating First Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Bush made a great first impression. She's put my mother -- and 
everybody's mother -- back in style. She's concerned about clothing, but not 
overly concerned. People like that about her," observed the man whose designs 
have made the Anne Klein label one of the most financially successful in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Bush will have a great impact on fashion," he continued, "just the way 
Mrs. Reagan did, but her impact will be exactly the opposite. Clothes are going 
to fit looser, glide over the body. Fewer tight-fitting shapes." 
</P>
<P>
With his spring collection, which opened at Bullock's last week and was 
designed long before Barbara Bush was a White House shoo-in, Dell'Olio appears 
to have anticipated the First Lady's influence. His new silhouettes are 
relaxed, skirts a bit longer, jackets a little slouchy. Skirts wrap and tie, 
pants pull on. Flourishes are kept to a minimum: a few gold buttons here, a 
crested blazer there. Casualness prevails. 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkling of Gauguin-inspired prints and vibrant awning stripes in shades of 
papaya, mango, watermelon and South Sea blue spark an otherwise navy-and-white 
collection, heavily influenced by the late French designer Coco Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a silky, Marilyn Monroe-esque halter-style, Anne Klein 
dresses are the most structured items in the line. 
</P>
<P>
Although the styles and colors of Dell'Olio's spring separates would suit Mrs. 
Bush, she and other women of her physical stature probably won't be wearing 
them, because, as the designer points out, the clothes don't come in large 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Even though more than half the women in America wear a Size 16 or larger, Anne 
Klein, like other designer lines, only fits women Sizes 2 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We work originally on a Size 8 model and the pattern is graded down to a 2 and 
up to a 14. Anything larger and you lose the proportion," explains Dell'Olio, 
who is renowned for his easy-fitting blazers and tailored pants. He points out 
that as many Size 2 Klein pieces are sold as Size 14s. 
</P>
<P>
The late Anne Klein, who died in 1974, purposely sized clothes larger than the 
specified size, he said. "A woman who wore a 16 would wear a 14," explained 
Dell'Olio, who has been the sole designer since 1984. "It was a psychological 
ploy Anne used. Women felt good wearing a smaller size. We don't do that any 
more -- a Size 12 fits a Size 12." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it does fit, with jackets priced from $600 to $800 and pants retailing 
at about $400, the collection is not economically feasible for average women. 
Yet last year the designer division of Anne Klein sold about $30-million 
dollars worth of merchandise in about 275 stores, Dell'Olio reports. A 
best-selling black wool crepe jacket in the cruise collection sold 600 pieces 
nationally, despite a price tag of more than $700. 
</P>
<P>
"Anne Klein has a customer who doesn't care about price -- she buys just what 
she likes and isn't put off by the cost," says the Brooklyn-born designer. 
"She's not who I worry about." He's concerned, he says, about the woman who 
buys the lesser-priced clothing under the Anne Klein II label. 
</P>
<P>
"We've exposed her to good clothing. She's trained to look for quality, but 
she's on a budget. With restrictions, duties and the drop in the dollar, it's 
difficult to keep our prices down," he says, adding that the sales volume and 
distribution of Anne Klein II is triple that of the more expensive collection. 
</P>
<P>
Even production in the Orient can't contain costs, Dell'Olio complains, because 
of rising fabric costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to afford cashmere blends for Anne Klein II -- we can't 
anymore," he said. "The Chinese are controlling the silk market and the prices 
have gone up, so we've turned to rayon. Now that's gone up. We keep maneuvering 
to keep the prices down." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, in addition to the Anne Klein and Anne Klein II collections, 
licensees manufacture shoes, belts, furs, jewelry, leather goods and swimwear 
under the Anne Klein label, bringing the annual volume to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dell'Olio predicts that within the next two years, the first Anne Klein 
designer boutiques will open in the United States. "It's inevitable," he said. 
"No store can afford to do it justice, the line is just too extensive for any 
one department or specialty store to represent the collection the way it is."

COUNTY'S 1ST TRAFFIC DEATH MURDER VERDICTS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court in Santa Ana on Thursday overturned the 1986 murder 
convictions of a man who killed two Costa Mesa teen-agers in a car crash as he 
fled from police, ruling that discrimination against Asians and Latinos was 
evident during jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reversed the first murder convictions ever in Orange County based 
on traffic deaths. The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled, 3 to 0, that the 
exclusion of a Vietnamese immigrant because of what the prosecutor stated was 
his inability to understand English was illegally based on a racial stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
In a 16-page opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin, the court also found 
that Ruben M. Valle's rights were violated during a police interrogation 
following his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Valle, driving a stolen van and chased by Costa Mesa police on Dec. 19, 1984, 
ran a stop sign and rammed a car carrying two Estancia High School students, 
Roy Williamson and Billy Dearing. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, both 17 and surfers, were heading for the beach. Both were killed, 
but Valle, who was later convicted on two counts of second-degree murder, 
walked away with only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
When told that two people had died in the crash, Valle responded, "I hope so," 
according to testimony at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King said his office would consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"If an appeal fails, obviously we will try the case again," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Valle, 24, of Santa Ana is now serving two sentences of 15 years to life at 
Folsom Prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my heart's pounding," Dearing's mother, Vicky Grage, said Thursday. "It's 
very disappointing. There was no doubt about his guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Grage, who lives in Lake Elsinore, said she "sat through every day of the 
trial. There is no doubt in my mind that he was guilty. If he were to be 
released, that would be very unfair. He took the lives of two boys." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Williamson, the mother of the other young victim, said she was "shocked 
and angry." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the criminal's rights are over-protected, and the victims and 
their families' rights are just ignored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disbelief and Shock 
</P>
<P>
Both mothers readily acknowledged that they did not understand the legal 
reasoning involved in the decision. But each expressed disbelief and shock that 
the man convicted of murdering their sons may now get another trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 4 years since this accident happened," Grage said. "You just don't 
get over it. Different things remind you of it. He committed a crime, and he 
needs to be punished." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said she believed that "justice had been carried out" but now has 
changed her mind. "I still think Mr. Valle belongs in prison," she said. "There 
are consequences every person must pay for what they do to other people." 
</P>
<P>
King's questioning of prospective jurors was the subject of scathing criticism 
by the appellate court, which said he had shown bias by disqualifying Tuoc Vo, 
a Vietnamese immigrant who worked as mechanic, when there were no proper 
grounds to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis of Group Bias 
</P>
<P>
The court found that King challenged Vo on the basis of group bias, violating 
Valle's right to have a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion, King stated that in his experience, which included a 
tour of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, "members of the Oriental 
race" can have difficulty learning English and can have "serious problems in 
understanding words that have abstract meanings to them." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's comments amounted to "a rather substantial mistake," according 
to Valle's attorney, J. Courtney Shevelson of Monterey. While inability to 
understand English may be a valid basis for excluding a prospective juror, 
Shevelson said, King failed to establish that Vo had such problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The court concluded that there was no indication of any language problem. He 
(Vo) had an accent. That's all that was established. He had no difficulty 
responding to questions," Shevelson said. 
</P>
<P>
King, seconded by state Assistant Atty. Gen. Howard Wayne, who argued the case 
before the appellate court, said the decision misstated the record and 
misinterpreted his grounds for objecting to Vo's presence on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inappropriate Responses 
</P>
<P>
"I did not excuse Mr. Vo because he was Oriental or because he was Vietnamese," 
King said. "I excused him because he had difficulty with the English language. 
That statement by me was intended to explain to the court why he (Vo) was 
having problems." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said the justices ignored Vo's inappropriate responses to several 
questions. For instance, Vo said, when asked if he would sympathize with Valle 
because he was a member of a minority, Vo first answered yes, then later said 
no. 
</P>
<P>
"The juror was not competent in the English language to sit through the trial," 
Wayne said "The Court of Appeal totally ignored this." 
</P>
<P>
King said he resented the decision's implication and insisted that he had 
simply been attempting to explain why Vo, in particular, showed a poor ability 
to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution and the defense each rejected 19 jurors during jury selection, 
but each accepted a Vietnamese immigrant as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
"If I discriminated, why did I keep the Vietnamese as an alternate?" King said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also found that King had improperly rejected a Latino man for jury 
service. While King said the prospective juror had expressed reservations about 
his ability to serve, the appellate court found that the prosecutor had failed 
to show any proper basis for rejecting him. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1984 traffic deaths that led to Valle's convictions, the police 
decision to chase a suspected car thief at high speeds over busy streets was 
closely scrutinized. The families of both victims sued the police, claiming 
that the chase was unnecessary and careless. But a jury last year exonerated 
Costa Mesa police. 
</P>
<P>
While the ruling on jury selection will not affect a new trial, the court's 
decision on Valle's statements to police at the time of his arrest could have a 
big impact. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court found that a police officer ignored Valle's decision not to 
talk after his arrest. Ultimately, Valle admitted his involvement in the 
accident in the discussion that followed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Thursday's decision, prosecutors have no statements from Valle 
that may be used in a new trial, King conceded. 
</P>
<P>
At his first trial, psychiatrists testified that Valle, who showed no signs of 
recent use of drugs or alcohol, had been acutely psychotic during the 
interrogation. Asked if he would waive his rights, Valle had responded that he 
did not know. Asked if he understood he was entitled to a lawyer, Valle had 
said he was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"Valle's rambling, nonresponsive answers, repeated protestations of hunger and 
request for sleep due to fatigue and pain do not support the inference of a 
knowing, intelligent and unequivocal waiver of the right to remain silent and 
the right to counsel," the court ruled.

A LONG ROAD FOR MASSIP;

<P>
POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS: RECOVERY IS TORTUROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her third pregnancy was an accident. And the tingle of excitement that Angela 
Thompson of Sacramento felt upon hearing the news in the fall of 1986 was 
quickly overshadowed by a dark sense of dread. 
</P>
<P>
"How do I tell my husband I'm pregnant again? What's society going to think of 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
The questions were obvious, for this was a woman who -- just 3 years earlier -- 
was charged with murdering her infant son by drowning him in a bathtub. 
Thompson claimed in court that she was the victim of postpartum psychosis at 
the time of the killing, believing her husband to be Christ and her son the 
devil. She was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected pregnancy crystallized for Thompson only the most dramatic of a 
host of uncertainties and anxieties that experts say are shared by thousands of 
women nationwide who are trying to recover from postpartum depression or, in 
its more severe form, psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massip in Court 
</P>
<P>
The same anxieties now await 24-year-old Sheryl Lynn Massip of Anaheim as she 
returns to court today after being acquitted by a judge Dec. 23 on charges of 
murdering her son. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to kill the 6-week-old infant by throwing him into oncoming 
traffic, Massip hit him over the head with a blunt instrument, then ran over 
him with the family Volvo. Massip became the first woman in Southern California 
to test the postpartum psychosis defense and, like Thompson, was found not 
guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
Under ordinary circumstances, such a ruling would require a defendant to submit 
to an extensive state mental examination that could keep her in an institution 
for up to 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
But the frail demeanor of this unlikely murder defendant, the brutality of her 
crime, the rarity of her defense and the judge's extraordinary decision to 
acquit her make Massip's case far from ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald will begin confronting a 
question that no other local judge has had to face: Under what circumstances 
should such a woman, found temporarily insane, be allowed to return to society? 
</P>
<P>
In her own answer to that question in a recent interview, Massip said: "I'm 
willing to do whatever the court feels is right. . . . It makes no difference, 
because no matter where I go, I'm doing time. I have to live with the death of 
my son for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Massip could in theory face up to 11 years in a state mental institution 
because of Fitzgerald's decision to throw out the jury's verdict and find her 
criminally insane. 
</P>
<P>
But even the prosecutor who tried to convict her doubts that will happen. Those 
close to the case say the former hairdresser and housewife -- still suffering 
from depression but apparently sane -- will more likely go free under 
supervised probation by state medical personnel and the court. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, defense attorney Milton C. Grimes is so confident that Massip is sane 
that he may ask the judge to forgo altogether the standard state-administered 
mental exam. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Grimes said, he wants the judge to allow Massip to voluntarily enter a 
program that would treat her bouts with depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Criminal' 
</P>
<P>
"She is not a criminal. She is not psychotic now. And she does not need to be 
locked up (in a state mental hospital) for any period of time," Grimes 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris said he would fight such a move. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some thoughts on what she needs," the prosecutor said. "She needs to go 
to state prison. But that's not one of the options right now, unfortunately." 
Given the judge's ruling, Borris said he "would like to see some independent 
people with no ties to either side evaluate her at a state hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating Massip's future further is the fact that the state mental health 
system is not accustomed to dealing with cases such as hers. The rarity of 
postpartum psychosis and its temporary nature make her an anomaly in the 
system, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disorder that doesn't fit any of the standard psychological 
classifications, and we don't really understand it all that well yet," said Dr. 
Carl Hanssen, chief of psychiatry at Metropolitan State Hospital in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a bizarre kind of thing, such a minuscule problem (in numbers of 
victims) that we rarely have to deal with it," Hanssen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Baby Blues' 
</P>
<P>
A severe form of the more common "baby blues," postpartum psychosis is thought 
to cause intense anxiety, psychotic delusions and even violence in about one to 
three of every 1,000 new mothers. Often, the women -- like Massip -- have no 
history of mental illness or violence, leading some researchers to suggest that 
the temporary disorder is rooted in the hormonal changes that women undergo 
after giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, as many as 24 California women each year suffer the extreme 
form of the psychosis and are driven to kill their babies. But most of those 
deaths are likely to be misattributed to willful child abuse or natural causes, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say the biological changes that women such as Massip have undergone as 
an apparent victim of postpartum psychosis can be easily treated with hormones 
such as progesterone and estrogen, making physical recovery well within reach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychological Issue 
</P>
<P>
But tougher to address are the emotional and psychological questions that loom 
-- as well as the social stigma that goes along with them. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Susan Hickman, a San Diego psychologist who runs a postpartum depression 
clinic and has treated several hundred women who have had post-pregnancy 
problems, says the disorder's aftereffects can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the whole range -- marriages breaking up, problems with alcohol, 
self-doubts and fears, depression. It can be an incredibly trying period," 
Hickman said. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, served with divorce papers as she sat in jail 2 years ago awaiting 
trial, said in several recent interviews that her plans are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by family members who attended every day of her 2-month trial, Massip 
wants to rebuild her life, come to terms with her own guilt and help "other 
women like me." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of years of healing left. I still have scars, and I just want to 
get better," she said, her voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thompson's Case 
</P>
<P>
Massip faces troubling prospects that Angela Thompson knows well. 
</P>
<P>
A registered nurse, Thompson said she and her doctors missed the budding signs 
of postpartum psychosis after the birth of her first child 9 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Left untreated, she said, her psychotic delusions, hallucinations, obsession 
with the devil and other signs of the illness reappeared with deadly force 
after the birth of her second child, Michael. She drowned the 9-month-old boy 
in a bathtub in her home near Sacramento in August, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquitted of her crime, Thompson faced a road to emotional recovery 
that at times seemed unbearably steep. 
</P>
<P>
There were biting remarks from unsympathetic outsiders who seemed skeptical or 
disdainful of any medical explanation for the killing of a child. 
</P>
<P>
There were -- and still are -- intense pangs of guilt and bouts with depression 
that at times have forced Thompson's hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Having Children Again 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most potent of all were Thompson's own vexing questions about her 
prospects for leading a normal life and someday having children again. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main anxieties that face women trying to recover from the disorder 
is the thought of having more children, specialists in the field say. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman, who runs a clinic for postpartum sufferers in San Diego, said some 
women find having more children to be "a healing experience that is therapeutic 
for them and their families." Others, she said, purge themselves of any such 
thoughts out of intense fear. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. James A. Hamilton, a retired Stanford University psychiatrist who is 
recognized as a world leader in the study of postpartum depression: "With 
proper attention, there's no reason these women cannot go on to lead normal, 
productive lives. . . . Without the right care, however, the danger for them -- 
and any other children they may have -- is high." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odds of Recurrence High 
</P>
<P>
Although postpartum psychosis is extremely rare, the odds of it recurring in a 
mother who has already experienced the disorder soar astronomically: She stands 
anywhere from a 30% to 84% chance of facing the same problems should she get 
pregnant again and not receive proper treatment, some medical experts estimate. 
</P>
<P>
With proper hormonal and psychiatric treatment, the risk is "virtually zero," 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such scientific evidence, the psychiatrist said that "prejudice and gut 
instincts" make him personally wary about such women having children again for 
fear of pressing the odds too far. 
</P>
<P>
Massip says she has no intention of having more children. Neither did Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when Thompson found out she was pregnant in fall, 1986, she said she was 
convinced that with proper treatment she could avoid endangering the child or 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had thought there was the possibility of my killing my baby again, I 
think I would hang myself first." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Depression 
</P>
<P>
The months after the birth were not trouble free. There were some recurring 
signs of postpartum problems -- sleeplessness, trouble concentrating, 
forgetfulness. 
</P>
<P>
But court-appointed health professionals, friends and family helped monitor her 
around the clock for the first 12 weeks of the child's life as a "safety net," 
Thompson said. After some initial problems, Thompson entered a halfway house at 
the insistence of state health workers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Thompson considers herself and her 22-month-old son to be out of danger. 
And she has no regrets about her decision to have the child. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember people used to see Allyson (her 9-year-old daughter) and say: 'Oh, 
is she an only child?' It really tore me up; I would just cringe inside," 
Thompson said. "Now Allyson has a brother again, and he has brought happiness 
back to us in a way that only a baby could." 
</P>
<P>
It is a happiness that Sheryl Massip fears may elude her. But Thompson offers 
the Anaheim woman this advice: "She has to understand this postpartum psychosis 
and learn to live with herself for what happened. That's the toughest part. 
</P>
<P>
"She has to know that it was the illness that killed the child, much like 
cancer kills a child -- separate from the mother. She just happened to have the 
illness. It's not an excuse for the tragedy; it's an explanation." 
</P>

ANGLO STUDENT COUNT DOWN IN COUNTY, MINORITIES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Anglo enrollment in Orange County schools continued its downward spiral this 
year, according to figures released this week by the county Department of 
Education. At the same time, enrollment of minority students has climbed, 
especially among Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Anglo students are 58.6% of the total enrollment in the county's 28 
school districts, down from 61% the previous year. Their number decreased to 
205,505 from 211,080 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, when the Orange County Department of Education first began 
collecting figures on racial and ethnic breakdowns, Anglo students represented 
85.9% of the total enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures reflect the challenge many school districts face to educate 
a broader spectrum of students from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, 
several educators said, including Dennis Smith, superintendent of the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Overall in the county, the report shows, the number of Latino students has 
increased 11%, while Asian student enrollment has increased 5% since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Even schools with small numbers of minority students are having to spend more 
resources on accommodating a student body with different teaching needs, said 
Smith, whose district has the county's highest percentage of Anglo students at 
92.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even in predominantly Anglo Laguna Beach Unified, "we're finding a great 
increase in second-language speakers, particularly in the elementary levels," 
Smith said. "We have many challenges in just getting our staff trained and 
providing good programs to those students." 
</P>
<P>
The figures, which are broken down by school districts, provide clues as to how 
Orange County is growing, and where ethnic groups tend to be concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the Huntington Beach Union School District, where Anglos make 
up 67% of the student body, total enrollment has continued to decline. In 1988, 
total enrollment dropped 7.6% to 15,199 students. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Ana Unified School District, where only a tenth of the district's 
40,028 students are Anglo, the district has had trouble keeping pace with the 
rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Capasso, a statistician for the Department of Education, said those 
numbers may reflect some communities' high housing prices, a factor that keeps 
out many young families. Areas such as Santa Ana, where housing is more 
affordable, continue to attract families with young children, she said, 
including many Latino and Asian families. 
</P>
<P>
Areas that are just developing, such as Mission Viejo to the south, are 
continuing to grow. In those higher income areas, the schools have very few 
minorities. In the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, for example, 
Anglo children make up 83% of the total student enrollment of 23,150. 
</P>
<P>
The trend in Orange County, which has been apparent for several years, mirrors 
what is happening statewide. In September, the state Deparment of Education 
announced that, for the first time, Anglo students were no longer the majority 
in California schools. Their numbers this school year make up 49.2% of the 
total state enrollment, according to a tally conducted just after the start of 
the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana school district's ethnic mix stands out not only among Orange 
County's school districts but also in the state. The district must accommodate 
children who speak 40 different languages. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Poggi, the director of bilingual education in Santa Ana Unified School 
District, said 51.8% of the students this year are categorized as 
"limited-English speaking." 
</P>
<P>
That is a far higher percentage than in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, where only 28% of the students are considered "limited English 
speaking," and it is the highest of any of the state's 10 largest school 
districts, Poggi said a recent state report shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles' total enrollment is so much higher than ours, which means that we 
are much more heavily impacted across the board (by students with special 
needs) than they are," Poggi said. 
</P>
<P>
RACIAL CHANGE IN SCHOOL ENROLLMENT 
</P>
<P>
Following a statewide trend, Anglo enrollment in Orange County schools 
continues to decline.

COUGARS FEEDING MAINLY ON DEER;

STUDY SHOWS NO FORAGING NEAR PEOPLE

<P>
At least 17 mountain lions now roam the Santa Ana Mountains, living off deer 
and small animals without having to forage in campgrounds and neighborhoods for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Those are some of the findings of the yearlong Orange County Cooperative 
Mountain Lion Study, which was completed this week, and a report submitted to 
county officials for review. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which was commissioned after cougars mauled two children in 1986, 
was undertaken to learn more about mountain lion behavior so that steps might 
be taken to prevent future attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The study also determined that: 
</P>
<P>
* Mountain lions are most active between 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. and least active 
between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* Adolescent lions seem to be less afraid of humans than their parents. In 
separate incidents, two young lions recently approached lone men and had to be 
frightened off. 
</P>
<P>
* The lions' home ranges fluctuate from month to month. As of 2 months ago, for 
example, one of the lions under study expanded her range to include Orange 
County's O'Neill Regional Park, where overnight camping is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators plan another year of study and, in fact, recommend an additional 
3 years of study to better understand the habits of mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good information now and it will be better," said study leader Paul 
Beier. He and investigator Reginald H. Barrett are on assignment from research 
posts at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The county is paying $140,000 for the study, but Beier said he would look for 
other sources of money, should the study be extended. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose south county 
districts encompass much of Orange County's mountain lion habitat, were 
unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The study area is concentrated in south county's Ronald W. Caspers Regional 
Park, a 7,500-acre camping preserve where 
</P>
<P>
5-year-old Laura Small of El Toro was mauled by a mountain lion on March 23, 
1986, and 6-year-old Justin Mellon of Huntington Beach was attacked by a lion 7 
months later. The surrounding properties of Rancho Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa 
Margarita, Starr Ranch and Coto de Caza are also included in the study. 
</P>
<P>
To help them monitor the lions' daily behavior, the researchers, assisted by a 
state tracking team, trapped four female lions in and near the park and placed 
collars on them. The collars transmit electronic signals which enable the 
researchers to pinpoint the animals' movements. 
</P>
<P>
The signals show that the four cougars maintain overlapping hunting ranges 
which all include portions of the park. In addition, tracks and sightings show 
that one of the females is now accompanied by two yearlings, possibly a male 
and a female. 
</P>
<P>
The study team is trying to trap and collar the yearlings before they leave 
their mother. Having tried and failed last month to do so, Beier said he is 
planning another attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four collared lions have been the focus of the study efforts, 
Beier and Barrett say in their 19-page report that they had encountered tracks 
and sightings in other parts of the county's backcountry which confirm that 
there are at least 17 lions in the Santa Ana Mountains, which straddle Orange, 
Riverside and San Diego counties. Beier said the lions, being nomadic hunters, 
move at will in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much of Area Inaccessible 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the 17 lions was all found in accessible areas such as roads and 
trails, the study notes. Because much of the area is inaccessible, Beier said 
25 lions is a more realistic estimate of the total population. 
</P>
<P>
In the Caspers Park study area, one of the more revealing observations is that 
the mountain lions are extremely competent hunters and show no dependence upon 
artificial food sources such as campground garbage, which was thought to be the 
case after the 1986 attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In examining lion feces, called scat, the researchers have documented that the 
animals are subsisting primarily on deer, and to a lesser extent on other wild 
animals. According to the team's analysis of scat over the past year, deer are 
present in 67% of the samples and opossum in 17%, with rabbit, coyote and 
bobcat present in the remainder. There was no evidence of any artificial food 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence shows that adult lions have been killing three to five deer per 
month, feeding on the carcasses for an average of 2 to 3 days. In the case of 
the lion mother, she has been killing for herself and her yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also established that mountain lions display two basic 
activity patterns -- hunting and feeding -- and that they are most active at 
night. During the hunting pattern, researchers said, the lion wanders as much 
as 5 miles in a 24-hour period, pausing to rest for periods of 30 to 90 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After the lion has killed a deer, it averages only about 2 miles of wandering 
over a 24-hour period. There is virtually no activity between 8 a.m. and 4 
p.m., and markedly less movement at night as well. The peak activity periods 
are at dusk and dawn, consisting generally of movement between a deer carcass 
and a daytime rest site, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunger No Motive for Attack 
</P>
<P>
With evidence that the cougars are such proficient hunters, Beier and Barrett 
suggested in their report that hunger was not a motivation for the attacks on 
children. Hunters tracked and killed an adolescent male lion shortly after 
Laura Small was injured. It was not determined that the lion was responsible. 
The lion that attacked Justin Mellon, who was slightly injured, was never 
found. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of these lions (under study) did attack children in 1986, this would 
contradict a popular belief that lion attacks on man are carried out only by 
lions unable to capture deer," the researchers say in the report. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have determined, however, that adolescent lions do appear to be 
less afraid of humans than adult lions, which almost always flee when a person 
approaches. In the past 2 months, yearling lions weighing between 50 and 85 
pounds have twice approached men on Rancho Mission Viejo land. 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, an apparently uncollared lion walked rapidly and directly 
toward an adult man (a tractor operator in the first case, a security guard in 
the second) until the man shouted and made a commotion, at which the lion ran 
away," the researchers say in their report. "These limited findings confirm 
reports from other studies that yearling lions may be more likely than an adult 
lion to approach humans." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid future encounters between man and cougar, the researchers suggested 
that future trails and campgrounds be placed away from canyon bottoms, where 
the research shows mountain lions spend the vast majority of their time hunting 
and feeding. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not more lion attacks occur in Orange County, Beier said, depends on 
how lions react to continued development. 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL LIONS AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
A report issued this week contains these findings about mountain lions in 
Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
At least 17 mountain lions are known to inhabit Orange County's Santa Ana 
Mountains, with an estimate of 25 for the local population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some belief, the lions subsist entirely on a diet of deer and 
smaller wild animals, without foraging for food in campground garbage cans or 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The mountain lions are "extremely competent" deer hunters, taking down an 
average of three to five deer per month. When they are not feeding on deer, the 
lions prey upon opossum, rabbit, coyote and bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adolescent lions seem less afraid of humans than adult lions, as evidenced by 
two recent instances in which yearling lions approached lone men until the men 
frightened them away with shouts. Adult lions, by contrast, tend to shy away 
from people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The lions are most active between between 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. and least active 
between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m.

JUDGE SETS DATE FOR BROWN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder trial of Anaheim Hills computer entrepreneur David A. Brown, accused 
of masterminding his wife's shooting death and letting his daughter take the 
blame for the crime, will begin March 29, a judge decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown set the trial date at Brown's arraignment 
in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, after the 36-year-old defendant 
pleaded innocent to the charges of murder and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's daughter, Cinnamon Brown, has spent the last 3 years in a California 
Youth Authority facility in Camarillo for the shooting death of her stepmother, 
Linda Brown. She now claims her father directed her to commit the 1985 crime. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to join Cinnamon Brown as a key witness against her father is the 
murder victim's sister, Patricia Bailey, 20. Bailey, who married Brown about 16 
months after her sister's death and also is charged with her murder, has agreed 
to cooperate with prosecutors in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In tape-recorded conversations with his daughter and with police, Brown -- who 
collected $835,000 from his wife's life insurance -- acknowledged that he knew 
about and took some role in a plot to kill his wife. But he has denied 
orchestrating it, saying he tried to talk his daughter of out of the plan.

CITY MANAGER WILL QUIT IF IRVINE COUNCIL ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager William Woollett Jr. said in a letter that he will resign if 
ordered to do so by the City Council, Assistant City Manager Paul Brady Jr. 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Woollett, who became Irvine's first and only city manager 17 
years ago, was responding to a letter he received Tuesday from Mayor Larry 
Agran, who asked for his resignation, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very basic tenet . . . that the city manager serves at the pleasure of 
the City Council," Woollett wrote in his response, according to Brady. "I 
believe in that tenet and certainly support it." 
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor's letter, City Council members will discuss Woollett's 
proposed resignation at a Feb. 14 meeting because, Agran wrote, "my sense of 
the City Council is that its members believe the time is at hand to make a 
transition to a new city manager." 
</P>
<P>
However, Council Member Sally Anne Sheridan disagreed. "I think we have a fine 
city manager," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asking for the resignation is a political move that would allow the mayor to 
broaden his authority, she said. But Agran denied Thursday having political 
motives in calling for Woollett's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
In Agran's letter, he also proposed that Brady become acting city manager and 
be considered for the position permanently. But Brady said he would not 
consider serving as interim city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need a 3-month trial basis," Brady said. "If they are interested in 
me, they ought to say so." 
</P>
<P>
Woollett could not be reached for comment Thursday.

WORKER DENIED SMOKING BAN AT CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The right to a "safe and healthful" workplace under state law does not include 
a smoke-free environment, an appellate court in Santa Ana ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision leaves David B. McCoy, a piano tuner at Cal State Fullerton and a 
passionate foe of smoking, assigned to work in a building with sealed windows 
and a ventilation system that he claims merely recirculates smoke-tainted air. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit against his employer, McCoy claimed unsuccessfully that he 
deserves the same protection from second-hand smoke he contends that the 
university affords to books, plants and computers. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, McCoy stated that his health was being ruined by constant exposure 
to smoke and that he had an allergy that left him wheezing, dizzy, suffering 
from headaches, nausea, fatigue and anxiety, all due to the university's 
inadequate effort to control the noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, an Orange County Superior Court judge ruled that the school had 
complied with a 1982 state law that prohibits smoking at meetings in 
government-funded offices and requires supervisors to try to accommodate 
nonsmokers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School's Efforts Upheld 
</P>
<P>
The state appellate court's unanimous decision Thursday upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In its opinion, the 4th District Court of Appeal noted that the university bans 
smoking in classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, theaters, gymnasiums, 
library reading areas, public assembly areas and common work areas. In fact, 
the opinion said, its policy is "far stricter" than the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that the university has done much to restrict the adverse 
impact of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence by the Legislature as to the details on how to achieve smoke-free 
work stations necessarily implies that each department or agency has the 
discretion to choose methods necessary to accommodate the legislative 
objectives in the context of the peculiarities of their individual work 
places," the opinion held. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has restricted smoking on its campus since 1978 and has 
regularly reviewed its smoking policy, the court noted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent setback, McCoy's lawyer, Stephen Berger of Newport Beach, 
said his client believes that things have improved as a result of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Better' 
</P>
<P>
"Things have gotten a little better," Berger said. "I think our lawsuit did 
cause them to start enforcing the smoking rules. They banned smoke in a couple 
of new places. We still have a problem, but it's better." 
</P>
<P>
Berger had urged the appellate court to find that a smoke-free environment 
should be required under in a state law mandating that "every employer shall 
furnish employment and a place of employment which are safe and healthful to 
employees therein." 
</P>
<P>
The court declined to do so but did offer some hope to those who oppose 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"A review of the authorities indicates that in a proper case, the court looks 
favorably on the plight of a nonsmoker in today's society. This is not such a 
case," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the experiences of a Turkish sultan, the court also rejected McCoy's 
claim that Cal State Fullerton's impressive smoking policy was not being 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have tried and failed to stamp out smoking, the court said, 
were Murad IV, a 17th-Century Turkish monarch; King James I of England, and 
early colonists in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy filed several grievances over working conditions, but none was 
successful. He also helped organize a petition drive seeking a prohibition on 
smoking anywhere on campus. That also failed, despite a referendum in 1987 that 
showed 72% of the student body favored such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Snitch 
</P>
<P>
McCoy claimed that, in response to his complaints, the administration provided 
him with an air cleaner and a respirator mask to wear at work. He also said 
that administrators encouraged him to turn in smokers who violated the rules 
but that, according to court documents, he refused to become a "spy, snitch or 
tattler." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy works in the Performing Arts Building under the title of instrument 
technician. Berger said McCoy has had some success in pursuing a claim of 
partial disability as a result of workplace conditions. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy could not be reached, and a university spokesman declined comment.

REPS. COX, ROHRABACHER START FRESHMEN TERMS HEAVILY IN DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's two newest congressmen are starting their terms in Washington 
heavily in debt, mostly from hard-fought primary campaigns in which they 
defeated large fields of candidates to capture the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports filed this week with the Federal Election Commission, C. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) was left more than $300,000 in debt after 
defeating 14 other candidates in a free-for-all GOP primary in June and 
coasting to victory in November. Cox, 36, succeeds Rep. Robert E. Badham 
(R-Newport Beach), who retired from his 40th Congressional District seat to 
start a private consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), 41, who takes over the western Orange County seat 
vacated by retiring Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach), is nearly $74,000 in 
debt after defeating eight candidates in his GOP primary for the 42nd District, 
then going on to win in November. 
</P>
<P>
Neither spent very much in their fall campaigns, contrasted with their heavily 
contested primary races. For both, winning the primary in their predominantly 
Republican districts all but assured that they would win the general election. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Cox spent more than $1 million on his bid for Congress. Rohrabacher 
got off much cheaper, spending only $465,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cox's biggest creditors are himself -- he still is owed about $90,000 of the 
$120,000 he lent himself for the campaign -- and several campaign consultants. 
The largest amount is $100,001 owed to Huckaby &amp; Rodriguez Inc. of 
Sacramento, which ran Cox's successful primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said Thursday that he will focus on repaying the debt as soon as he has 
organized his Washington and district offices and gotten settled in his new 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that when I am able to spend the time necessary to attack the problem 
head-on we will be able to promptly repay the debt," Cox said. "It is much 
easier to raise funds as an incumbent member of Congress than as a challenger. 
We did spectacularly well last year when I was the gleam in somebody's eye. I 
would expect we'd do as well this year." 
</P>
<P>
Richard T. Dykema, Rohrabacher's chief of staff, said the congressman plans to 
hold fund-raisers and contact various people and organizations who might be 
willing to help. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate. Our debt is not as large as Chris'," Dykema said. "But we 
definitely will have to work at it." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's biggest single bill was the unpaid portion of a $24,971 loan to 
himself, of which he had repaid about half. He also owed his consultant for the 
primary campaign, Allan Hoffenblum of Los Angeles, $11,440. 
</P>
<P>
Also filing reports were candidates for legislative races, including two in 
Orange County that featured fiercely competitive campaigns -- one for the 
Assembly and one for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising in the 72nd Assembly District race between Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and Riverside County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach totaled nearly $1.9 million, a record for an 
Orange County Assembly contest. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who defeated Thierbach by fewer than 900 votes, raised $911,333, while 
Thierbach raised $980,599. Most of their money came from Republican and 
Democratic party sources. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the 33rd Senate District seat, the successful incumbent, Sen. 
Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), raised $1.58 million, while his Republican 
opponent, former Cerritos Mayor Don Knabe, collected just over $1 million. 
Green won that race by about 3,500 votes out of more than 205,000 votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Among legislators who were easily reelected in November, Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) raised $339,834 and reported $29,465 on hand as of 
Dec. 31. Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) took in $359,971 and had 
$285,800 in the bank. Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) raised $313,987 and 
had just $1,373 left at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) collected $334,619 and had $51,810 on hand, even 
after contributing more than $100,000 to the California Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) reported raising $503,080 and had 
$33,135 left in one of his two campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's other committee, organized for his unsuccessful 1986 campaign for 
state controller, still lists an official debt of $416,800. But more than half 
that amount -- $237,500 -- is owed to Campbell's Senate campaign committee and 
need not be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
More troublesome to Campbell are debts of $25,000 to Technosearch Inc., a New 
York venture capital firm; $20,000 to Student Insurance Division of Los 
Angeles; $15,000 to Don Messick, who owns a San Juan Capistrano printing firm, 
and $24,600 to the Irvine Co., which has already forgiven $29,600 in principal 
and interest owed by Campbell's committee. 
</P>
<P>
But under Proposition 73, Campbell is in a tough spot: The money he borrowed 
under the old rules must be repaid under the new law that limits contributions. 
Campbell will have to solicit a greater number of small contributions from a 
larger number of people. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Campbell's private benefactors wanted to forgive the loans, they could 
only waive $1,000 worth of debt each fiscal year because forgiving a loan is 
considered the same as making a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating," Campbell aide Jerome Haleva said. "Sen. Campbell 
believes he engendered these debts under the old rules and should be allowed to 
repay them under the old rules. It's going to be much more difficult to repay 
these now."

UC IRVINE HOLDS OFF FULLERTON; 
</P>
<P>
BUTLER HAS A NIGHT TO REKINDLE MEMORIES OF MAGEE FOR ANTEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Butler lost a year of eligibility because of Proposition 48 and gained 
about 30 pounds in the process. He started the season as a third-string power 
forward, endured the fat jokes -- ("Hey Ricky, if you can't guard him, eat 
him!") -- and slowly worked his way into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at Cal State Fullerton, the 6-7 sophomore -- who is down to 254 
pounds -- from Ocean View High School turned in the kind of performance that 
until now had only been a vision in Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Butler tied his season-high (17 points) in the first half and hit a leaning 
9-foot jumper over three defenders with 37 seconds left in the game to propel 
the Anteaters to a 77-73 Big West victory over Fullerton in front of 3,202 in 
Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is 7-11 overall and 4-5 in conference. Fullerton dropped to 8-10, 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricky Butler killed us in the middle," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "I've 
never seen him play that way before." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who finished with a game-high 23 points and 7 rebounds, made 9 of 13 
shots, 5 of 8 free throws . . . and Mulligan smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricky's going to be another Kevin Magee," a beaming Mulligan said, referring 
to the former Irvine star who averaged 26 points a game in two seasons with the 
Anteaters. "He's going to be a big-time player. Everybody's going to be around 
him from now on." 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, who had been winning or losing (mostly losing) on their 
perimeter shooting, didn't take a jump shot until almost 7 minutes had expired. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach said there was a hole inside of their matchup (zone) and we weren't 
supposed to shoot outside until the post had touched the ball twice," said 
senior Kevin Floyd, who, for the third consecutive year, had a magnificent game 
in Titan Gym. "We were tempted, but we jammed it in." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans switched to a man-to-man defense in the second half with a lot of 
help on Butler. That freed Floyd to create a bit and few do it better. Floyd, 
who made 7 of 8 from the field and all 4 of his free-throw attempts, finished 
with 18 points and 3 assists. Center Mike Doktorczyk also had 18 points for 
Irvine before fouling out with 1:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans got the bulk of their offense from more-expected sources. Guard Mark 
Hill, who made 5 of 10 3-pointers, and forward Cedric Ceballos, who Mulligan 
calls the "best pro prospect in the league," both had 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a typical Irvine game, a real battle," Sneed said. "I was pleased with 
our defense in the second half, but the tempo got too fast for us. I was 
especially proud of Mark Hill, who was under the weather with the flu but 
played great. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we lost confidence tonight. We feel good about this loss." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot 55% from the floor on the evening, including 4 of 4 from 3-point 
range. Fullerton was 45% from the floor and made just 12 of 21 free throws, a 
statistic Sneed is sure to point out. 
</P>
<P>
With Butler scoring 10 of Irvine's first 18 points, the Anteaters jumped out to 
a 9-point lead (18-9) with 12:37 to play in the first half. But the Titans 
rallied behind Ceballos and trailed by just 3 (37-34) at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The change in defense gave Fullerton an early advantage after the intermission 
and the Titans got their biggest lead of the game, 53-47, on a driving 6-footer 
and ensuing free throw by Wayne Williams with 11:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anteaters came back to outscore Fullerton, 16-3, and never trailed 
again, although the game was tied at 66-66 and 69-69. Floyd made all 4 free 
throws in the final 2 1/2 minutes, including both ends of a one-and-one with 10 
seconds left to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who seldom gets much praise for his defense, drew the unenviable 
assigment of guarding Ceballos, who is 2 inches taller. He didn't exactly shut 
him down, but he made him work for every point. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been guarding mostly perimeter guys this year, so it was a little 
different underneath," Floyd said. "Maybe I didn't do the best job ever on him. 
I was getting tired. I just tried to make sure he was getting tired, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, meanwhile, had decided the only way to stop Butler was by 
committee. He drew a crowd every time he got the ball in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to get my confidence and the feel again," Butler said. "I've 
really been working and I've lost a few more pounds in the last couple of 
weeks. The guys got me the ball tonight and I got lucky a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had cut the Irvine lead to 1, 73-72, when Butler made his move to 
the basket, pivoting around both John Sykes and Derek Jones to pop in the 
high-arching jumper with 37 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod (Palmer) had thrown it into me once and I tossed it back," Butler said. "I 
heard Mulligan screaming at me from the bench to take it to the hole. So the 
next time I got it, I went. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been throwing them out of the house (blocking shots) all night, so I 
put a little extra height on that one." 
</P>
<P>
The result was a high time for the Anteaters and only their second victory on 
the road this season.

RAMS' WHITE, JOHNSON HEAD UNPROTECTED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams made public their list of 19 unprotected players Thursday and, as 
expected, it contained nary a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
It did, however, contain several members of the 30-and-over club, which 
figures, since the Rams are concerned that way. Ten of the 19 players -- 
running backs Charles White and Mike Guman, defensive linemen Gary Jeter and 
Greg Meisner, linebackers Jim Collins and Carl Ekern, snapper Mike McDonald, 
tight end Eric Sievers, safety Johnnie Johnson and quarterback Mark Herrmann -- 
are or will be 30 before the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the selected Rams are or probably will be, in the team's mind, 
career backups. Included in that list are cornerback Mickey Sutton, wide 
receiver Michael Young, defensive lineman Fred Stokes, running backs Buford 
McGee, Tim Tyrrell and Keith Jones, offensive lineman Mike Schad, tight end Jon 
Embree and linebacker Mark Jerue. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to try to look at your team in a lot of different ways," said Coach 
John Robinson, who is attending the scouting combine meetings in Indianapolis. 
"We used a lot of different criteria to make the judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also said that he didn't expect "an awful lot of (player movement) for 
the first period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing rules, which have been written by the National Football 
League's Management Council and disputed by the NFL Players Assn., an 
unprotected player has until April 1 to test the free-agent market. Otherwise, 
he can return to his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my one opportunity to market Johnnie Johnson and see what he's worth," 
Johnson said. "I can't tell you how thrilled I am." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, if all works out as he hopes, has reason to be pleased with the Rams' 
decision. His contract, which ends at the conclusion of the 1990 season, calls 
for a salary of $200,000 in 1989 and $200,000 in 1990. By shopping his skills 
around, Johnson said he could possibly double his money. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I had such a solid season last year, that benefits me even 
more," he said. "It's a decision I'm glad was made." 
</P>
<P>
As for the 37 players still considered sole property of the Rams, Johnson sends 
his condolences. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stress enough how I feel about those players," he said. "I feel sorry 
for the players on each team who can't (test the market)." 
</P>
<P>
White, who said he thought his unprotected status wasn't related to a substance 
abuse relapse last season, preferred to remain with his security blanket, the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't understand," he said. "They do what they have to do. But I'm 
not looking to go anywhere as of right now. As of right now, (I'm) still a 
Ram." 
</P>
<P>
White previously has been made available to other teams. The Rams have placed 
him on waivers twice and each time reclaimed him without incident. So when news 
of the latest management strategy reached him, White was prepared for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was just a business decision," White said. "In this business, 
nothing catches you by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Should White, for whatever reason, not return to the Rams, he said he'll 
attempt to sign with another team. 
</P>
<P>
The others . . . and probable reasons for being included on the unprotected 
list: 
</P>
<P>
Jones -- Released once during the 1988 season. A scout-team member. 
</P>
<P>
Guman -- Just finished the final year of a guaranteed contract. On injured 
reserved until the last regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrrell -- A special teams player, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers -- No mystery here. A last-season acquisition who didn't figure to get 
past third string at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
McGee -- Look for him to re-sign. The Rams, despite sticking him on the list, 
like McGee. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald -- He might be able to make a better deal elsewhere. You'd be 
surprised how many teams need a dependable snapper. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue -- Two bad knees. 
</P>
<P>
Collins -- Knee injuries galore. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern -- A 13-year veteran whose guaranteed contract is up. Just turned 33. 
</P>
<P>
Jeter -- Despite recording 11 1/2 sacks -- a career year -- Jeter is seriously 
considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Meisner -- He'll be 30 in April. He held out, then hurt his knee and didn't 
play until Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Schad -- Still under contract, but apparently out of chances. Rams obviously 
aren't worried that he'll sign elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Embree -- Has little or no shot at playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Young -- Can try to return as the fourth wide receiver or improve his chances 
with another team. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann -- A short-term insurance policy for Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes -- No jobs available. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton -- Good enough to sign with someone else.

PETTENGILL DISCARDS HIS MISGIVINGS AND LEARNS TO EXCEL IN ROLE AS POINT MAN FOR 
KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-three dribbles and one assist marked Mike Pettengill's debut as a 
varsity point guard at Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
Pettengill was a nervous freshman, brought up to the varsity by Kennedy Coach 
John Mayberry for a tournament at Cerritos High. The idea was for Pettengill, 
who had been playing on the junior varsity, to gain a little experience 
practicing and watching games from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But Pettengill found himself in a game during the waning minutes of a blowout 
victory over Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
He dribbled the ball upcourt, fighting the butterflies as he went. He kept 
dribbling and dribbling, looking for someone to get open. Finally, he found 
someone, but not before Mayberry counted 33 consecutive dribbles. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd cheered when he finally passed," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Pettengill told Mayberry he did not want to be a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Pettengill managed to record an assist and added a free throw, but he 
envisioned himself as a shooting guard. Playing point was too difficult, he 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
Three years and countless passes later, Pettengill, a 5-foot 10-inch senior, 
has established himself as a prototypal point guard. His resume includes an 
Orange County-leading 9.6 assists a game last season. He also helped Kennedy 
win the Garden Grove League and Southern Section 3-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
This season he averages 6.6 assists, 13 points and -- despite controlling the 
ball 90% of the time -- only 5 turnovers a game. Kennedy is 15-7 overall and 
8-2 in the Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive is his transition from reluctant passer to Kennedy's 
unquestioned leader. He is no longer "scared to death" on the court, but a 
composed and polished player, eager to take control in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't used to like being the point guard, but now I love knowing that 
everyone is depending on me," Pettengill said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mayberry: "I always knew he was going to be my starting point guard. I 
think he just built some confidence." 
</P>
<P>
His confidence has swelled as he has matured into his role as Kennedy's floor 
leader. Often, he directs the team's practices whenever Mayberry is a few 
minutes late. He puts the team through the drills, deciding which to run 
beforehand. He consults with Mayberry on what offenses and defenses the team 
should work on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now to the point where I can read Coach Mayberry's mind," Pettengill 
said. "I know what he would say. I know all his drills." 
</P>
<P>
It started when Pettengill was a junior. Mayberry wanted him to take more of a 
leadership role on what was hoped would be a championship-caliber team. 
</P>
<P>
But running practice? 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little late one day, so I took it upon myself to start practice," 
Pettengill said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mayberry: "He's out of the old mold in his leadership abilities. He 
doesn't try to cut corners. Sometimes he'll add drills we haven't done in a 
long time. Sometimes I'll just go out on the floor and watch what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Pettengill's favorite games in practice is a free throw shooting 
contest. Each player lines up to shoot a one-and-one. If the player makes it, 
the team gets a point. If he misses, Mayberry gets two points. 
</P>
<P>
Pettengill, who makes 77% in games, likes to shoot last because he likes to 
have to have the contest riding -- and his teammates depending -- on his free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure was something he was confronted with almost on a nightly basis during 
the playoffs last season. It proved to be a turning point in Pettengill's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
After spending his sophomore season as the backup point guard, he became the 
starter as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady introduction to the starting lineup. Kennedy had a veteran team 
and expectations were high. Twins Michael and Maurice Keith, Mike Williams and 
Wendell Lauderdale were experienced seniors, determined since they were junior 
high teammates to win a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
After an easy victory over Troy in the first round, the games got tougher. 
Kennedy had to go to Lancaster to play Antelope Valley, where it pulled off a 
58-55 victory. Next was top-seeded Saddleback in the quarterfinals. A late 
drive by Pettengill sealed a 58-55 victory over the Roadrunners. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Pettengill was a steadying influence in an 83-80, 
triple-overtime victory over Rolling Hills. Compared with that, the final 
against Tustin in the Sports Arena was a breeze. Kennedy took the title, 58-54, 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to the state championship game stalled in the semifinals, where the 
Fighting Irish lost to Bakersfield Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Pettengill said those tense playoff games made him a better player. This 
season, he has tried to pass on what he learned. He said the team often watches 
a videotape of the triple-overtime game against Rolling Hills, trying to pick 
out the little things that helped Kennedy win the game. 
</P>
<P>
What they see again and again is Pettengill taking control and leading Kennedy 
to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"In the playoffs last year, his teammates wanted him to have the ball in his 
hands," Mayberry said. "He wanted it too. That's rare. I haven't had many 
players like that." 
</P>

SOVIET TV PLANS TO SELL COMMERCIAL TIME TO ADVERTISERS; 
</P>
<P>
NOW, COMRADES, A WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Soviet television viewers could soon be exposed to regular doses of something 
all too familiar to Westerners: commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect arose at a news conference Thursday to announce that the world's 
biggest advertising agency, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, has been hired to advise the 
Soviets on how to attract Western advertisers and their hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to build up corporate images and familiarize Soviets with the types 
of products they can expect from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
consumer-oriented reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Since our audience is not used to commercials at all, it's a sort of 
entertainment for them," said Jane Tarassova, head of legal services at 
Gostelradio, the government broadcasting agency. 
</P>
<P>
Gostelradio has hired the London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as its exclusive 
worldwide consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the consultancy is to help them generate revenue from 
advertising," said Michael Parker, deputy managing director of Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be saying to them: 'These are the advertising agencies around the world 
that you will need to talk to; these are the big advertisers around the world 
who are likely to be spending money on Soviet television."' 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, Soviet television has 
experimented with commercials for Western products. 
</P>
<P>
Images of Michael Jackson dancing to rock music in a Pepsi commercial flickered 
across Soviet screens last year, and British Airways, the DHL courier service, 
Omega Watches and Benetton clothing also have advertised there. 
</P>
<P>
Tarassova said to Soviet viewers, the Western TV ad "is beautifully done, it's 
interesting in some sort of way, it presents a piece of foreign music." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said the consultancy agreement is open-ended. He refused to say how much 
the Soviets are paying for it but said Gostelradio could expect to take in 
millions of dollars in ad revenues within the next 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that enticing Western companies to advertise in a country where 
their products aren't available will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term," he said, "you will tend to see the sorts of advertisements 
which are corporate in nature. They are simply establishing the name and 
reputation of the company against that time when they'll be in a position to be 
actively selling." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet TV broadcasts on two main channels, with regional channels in all the 
republics. The estimated audience is 180 million, with another 30 million 
viewers in East bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching that audience, Parker said, will cost Western advertisers $17,500 to 
$35,000 per 30-second commercial. A comparable nationwide TV commercial in 
Britain, a country of 56 million people, averages $52,500. 
</P>
<P>
Tarassova predicted Western commercials would have Soviet viewers glued to 
their sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the mass audience it's a kind of new and interesting thing to 
watch," she added.

560 MINORITY FIRMS READY TO DO BUSINESS AT CONFERENCE

Nine years ago, Jim Espinosa decided he couldn't spend yet another year working 
for somebody else. He wanted to start his own business, and he went looking for 
advice on how he should do it. But finding the kind of help he needed wasn't 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy -- who I had hired to help me -- said that because of my last name, I 
would never amount to anything more than a shipping clerk on a warehouse 
floor," recalled Espinosa, who is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa, 50, proved him wrong. Today he is the owner of Orange Coast Electric 
Supply Co., a Santa Ana electric parts distributor with 25 employees and more 
than $9 million in annual sales. He credits part of his success to programs at 
area corporations that set aside a percentage of subcontracting work for 
minority-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa was among 560 minority business owners who attended an Anaheim 
conference on Thursday to make contact with representatives of about 100 Orange 
County and Los Angeles area corporations interested in contracting with 
minority-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to get some business," said Lou Flores, owner of Forms Consultants, 
a Westminster office supplies company. "We wouldn't usually get a chance to 
meet corporate buyers. This is a way for us to get our foot in the door." 
</P>
<P>
Very few minority business owners walked away from the conference with 
contracts in hand. But many said they felt encouraged, and some had scheduled 
follow-up sessions with potential corporate clients. "I've learned a lot and 
made some good contacts," said Nick Rosas, owner of NC Fabrication, a Santa Ana 
machine shop. 
</P>
<P>
A number of corporate participants said they were looking for minority-owned 
high-technology firms. Aerospace companies in particular said they need 
minority vendors to work on complex projects such as satellites and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say there is a serious shortage of these companies," said John M. 
Keany, corporate liaison with Hughes Aircraft. "We can't find enough of them." 
The shortage, said experts, reflects the large amounts of money required to get 
into the aerospace business. 
</P>
<P>
Companies working on federally funded projects received orders in November to 
try harder to contract with minority-owned businesses. Congress passed 
legislation imposing fines on firms that fail to maintain existing affirmative 
action quotas on certain kinds of projects. 
</P>
<P>
"CEOs in Orange County are reaffirming their efforts to hire minority-owned 
businesses," said Albert Dawson, chairman of the the Orange County Regional 
Purchasing Council, a nonprofit organization that sponsored Thursday's 
conference. "This new legislation has real teeth in it." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said the financial health of the minority business community has 
steadily improved since the first Minority Business Opportunity Day was held 7 
years ago. Since then, total revenue reported by minority-owned businesses in 
Southern California has grown from $200 million to $700 million, according to 
the Southern California Regional Purchasing Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more opportunities and more sensitivity on the behalf of a majority 
of corporations in the area," Dawson said. "We have come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Minority business owners seemed unconcerned about a recent Supreme Court 
decision that struck down strict affirmative action quotas used to hire 
minority firms for city and state government projects. The ruling did not apply 
to set-aside programs involving federal funds or to contracts between private 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The only impact I think it will have is to send a message to corporations that 
are uncomfortable dealing with minority vendors that it is OK to shut them 
out," said Ron Parker, owner of Software Creations, a Carson software 
development firm.

U.S. SLIPPAGE FEARED IN DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIAL SAYS FUNDING FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH IS 'FIRST TO GO' WHEN PENTAGON 
BUDGETS ARE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

America is in danger of losing its technological supremacy on the battlefield 
because of inadequate funding for Pentagon research programs, a senior Defense 
Department official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Pentagon) budgets are cut, the first thing to go is advanced technology 
research," said Raymond S. Colladay, director of the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency. "It ought to be the other way around. The situation is getting 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Colladay made his remarks Thursday at the Winter Convention on Aerospace and 
Electronics Systems. It was the final day of the 3-day annual defense industry 
conference in Costa Mesa, attended by about 300 top defense industry officials 
getting a glimpse of the Pentagon's plans for tomorrow's weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big-Ticket Systems Favored 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Thursday's session, Wincon meetings were classified and 
closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Colladay, former director of NASA's aeronautics and space research and 
technology programs, has headed DARPA for the past year. As the Pentagon's main 
research arm, DARPA's main task is maintaining U.S. technological superiority 
over the Soviet Union and other potential adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Colladay's view that the U.S. military may be losing its technological edge was 
shared by another speaker, Anthony R. Battista, who retired as a staff member 
of the House Armed Services Committee last year and now works as a defense 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Battista said the armed services have traditionally favored big-ticket weapons 
systems while pushing research into new technologies "down the priority list." 
As a result, the massive military buildup undertaken by former President Reagan 
did little to enhance the nation's defense technology. 
</P>
<P>
When Reagan came into office the defense industry was "euphoric," Battista 
said. "Everyone thought they were going to get everything back that President 
Carter had cut. . . . They were not selective; they were greedy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were throwing money down the rat hole in a duplication of programs" among 
the military services, Battista said. "Technology was de-emphasized. The money 
all went into platforms and large weapons systems." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Pentagon's proposal, the DARPA budget would swell to $1.2 billion in 
fiscal 1990, from $785 million this year. But Colladay said that is still not 
enough money to keep the nation on the cutting edge of technology. He 
emphasized that Pentagon research programs do not serve solely military 
purposes, but sometimes have commercial uses as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Resolution TV 
</P>
<P>
An example would be DARPA's recent decision to finance the development of an 
advanced high-resolution video display, a move also aimed at reviving the 
American television manufacturing industry. The project is designed to develop 
high-resolution display screens for use on combat aircraft, battle simulators 
and other military uses. 
</P>
<P>
The program will enlist the help of American electronics and semiconductor 
manufacturers to develop the next generation of television equipment, known as 
high-definition television, or HDTV, which is supposed to bring movielike 
clarity to home TV sets. The Japanese now dominate TV manufacturing and are 
known to be far ahead of competitors in development of HDTV. 
</P>
<P>
Other DARPA research projects include lightweight satellites, 
super-maneuverable aircraft, superconductors, high-speed computing and 
sophisticated sensors that would automatically recognize targets. The agency is 
also funding research on "neural networks" -- artificial intelligence computers 
that recognize and compare patterns and then solve problems in ways similar to 
that of the human brain.

Those lusty hard rockers in Guns N' Roses must have appetite for No. 1. Their 
"Appetite for Destruction" keeps returning to the top spot of the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart. The album, which has sold more than 6 million units 
in 77 weeks, moved up one notch, bouncing Bobby Brown's "Don't Be Cruel" to No. 
2. Hit singles have been keeping "Appetite" alive. The latest is "Paradise 
City" -- No. 25 on the singles chart. Guns N' Roses may replace itself at No. 1 
with its other Top Five album -- "G N' R Lies" (No. 4). 
</P>
<P>
* America's teen queen is picking up where she left off with her smash debut 
album. "Electric Youth," which entered the chart at an impressive No. 42, has 
already laid to rest any notions that Debbie Gibson is a flash-in-the-pan. The 
first single from the album, "Lost in Your Eyes," raced up to No. 12 on the pop 
chart in just one month.

OPERA CENTER FINE-TUNING BALANCED BUDGET, SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Music Center Opera is projecting for 1989-90 its first balanced 
budget, following three years of accumulating deficits. Company officials 
announced details of the new season, featuring three new productions, at a 
press conference Thursday, stressing solidarity behind current management and 
the conviction that its years of deficits are over. 
</P>
<P>
The major changes in the season are the elimination of "Orlando Furioso" (a new 
production from San Francisco Opera) and the replacement of a new "Idomeneo" by 
a borrowed "Le Nozze di Figaro." Additions are a double bill of the Oliver 
Knussen/Maurice Sendak works, "Where the Wild Things Are" and "Higglety, 
Pigglety, Pop!," and "Oklahoma!," ending the season in June. 
</P>
<P>
Although expenses are slightly more and earned income less than predicted for 
the current season, the deficit for this year will be substantially less, 
thanks to an increase of $1.5 million in contributed income. The season deficit 
is now listed at $807,959, creating a cumulative total of $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the deficit problem, board chairman Roy Ash insisted that these 
first three seasons of productions should be considered start-up years, and 
that the company now considers its initial investment to be complete. The next 
step, he said, "starts by operating on balanced budgets from here on out." 
</P>
<P>
Ash also said that the board has obtained commitments for individual gifts 
totaling more than $6 million, earmarked for a much-deferred and still not 
clearly formulated capital fund. The company projects applying $1.2 million 
from this fund toward deficit reduction for 1989-90, bringing the accumulated 
deficit under $2 million by June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity about the MCO deficits and widely bruited rumors about possible new 
executive leadership when general director Peter Hemmings' contract expires 
seemed to be behind the unusual presence all chief company officers. Ash and 
board president Bernard Greenberg both stressed their support for Hemmings' 
work, and Greenberg announced that they are discussing a new contract with 
Hemmings. "We want to be able to assure ourselves that he will be here for the 
next five years," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Hemmings said that the company has no plans to appoint a music director, though 
he also is projecting an increased season and presence for the company when the 
completion of Disney Hall opens dates in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Changes 
to the Pavilion and its operation that the company is considering or proposing 
include the addition of standing room at the back of the orchestra seating 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic personnel for the new season remains largely as previously announced. 
The new "Tosca," which opens the season Sept. 6, will be staged by Elijah 
Moshinsky, however, rather than Peter Hall. Hemmings described the production 
as a vehicle for Maria Ewing, singing her first Tosca. 
</P>
<P>
The newly unveiled portion of the season continues what Hemmings considers a 
company tradition of ending with an operetta or musical, a spot occupied in 
prior years by "Porgy and Bess," "The Mikado" and "Orpheus in the Underworld." 
The Kussen/Sendak works also figure in the company's outreach plans. 
</P>
<P>
A production of "Le Nozze di Figaro" from Chicago replaces "Idomeneo" as a 
fiscal concession to deficit reduction. Hemmings pointed out that a borrowed 
"Figaro" would be cheaper and expected to sell more tickets than the 
home-produced, less popular "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
"Idomeneo," however, has only been deferred until the following year. Other 
highlights of the 1990-91 season are new productions of "Fidelio," directed by 
Gotz Friedrich; "Elektra," directed by Hall, and "Hansel and Gretel," designed 
and staged by Sendak and Frank Corsaro. 
</P>
<P>
Other works for 1990-91 are "Aida," with Leona Mitchell and Placido Domingo in 
the production that opened the new opera house in Houston this season, and 
"Nixon in China," getting its much anticipated West Coast premiere in 
association with the 1990 Los Angeles Festival.

SPRAY-PAINT VANDALS MAKE A BIGGER MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local mural production may be flourishing these days, but mural vandalism via 
graffiti seems to be worse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest hurdle in terms of whether muralists have the incentive to 
keep painting murals," said muralist Kent Twitchell. "If (graffiti vandals) hit 
the one I'm working on now, it'll probably take that incentive right out of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell said that his Olympic freeway murals of artists Lita Albuquerque and 
Jim Morphesis at the 7th Street underpass of the Harbor Freeway, common targets 
for vandals, have been more frequently marred with graffiti recently. What's 
worse is that lately the vandals seem to have forsaken an attitude of "honor 
among thieves" and now scribble directly on the murals' faces, no longer only 
on the blank "negative spaces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell and other muralists believe that gang members defacing their works 
with slogans and symbols are responsible for most of recent rise in graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day five Crips came in here with spray paint and one said, 'I could 
fix that up real nice,' " said Roberto Delgado, referring to the mural he is 
painting at an East Los Angeles housing project. "We were taking bets that it 
would be all covered up. It wasn't, but over the course of time people are 
going to put stuff over it." 
</P>
<P>
Most muralists cover their works with a protective acrylic coating that 
prevents the graffiti from penetrating through, but the graffiti must still be 
cleaned off. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell, with about 20 murals to his credit, is probably the city's most 
prolific artist. He shares Delgado's pessimistic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more graffiti in the last two years since the efforts began to clean 
it up," said Twitchell, who has sued the man who painted over his popular 
"Freeway Lady" mural formerly overlooking the Hollywood Freeway near downtown. 
"Nothing that's being done now seems to be working." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such gloomy observations, efforts to address the problem continue. Some 
are community-based programs that put community members to work cleaning up 
graffiti everywhere. Other programs are more specifically geared toward mural 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Los Angeles Unified School District will offer a mural workshop 
co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Mural Conservancy and Art Educators of America 
which will include mural inspection and conservation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls Unlimited project, which has a 
$250,000 grant from the City of Los Angeles to wage graffiti clean-up efforts 
as well as to get to the root of the problem. By providing youths with such 
constructive outlets as mural painting, city officials hope the youths won't be 
tempted to join gangs or engage in delinquent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
James Anderson, a 22-year-old who is helping Roderick Sykes paint one of the 
Neighborhood Pride murals, believes that the program will work by example. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like telling the young kids that graffiti is not the thing. If you want 
to put something on a wall, why not put a flower or a human being sharing 
something with another human being? Unite together rather than painting gang 
words or symbols."ZAN DUBIN

SAWYER TO BE ANCHOR SUBSTITUTE FOR ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of her deal to come to ABC from CBS, Diane Sawyer will get to 
substitute-anchor both "World News Tonight" and "Nightline," ABC News President 
Roone Arledge said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized, however, that she'll be concentrating on the main reason ABC 
hired her -- co-anchoring with Sam Donaldson a new prime-time news series that 
Arledge said probably will debut at the end of July or in early August. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first couple of years, her interest is almost totally going to be on 
this program," he said of the as-yet untitled series, to originate live from 
New York. Plans call for it to air at 10 p.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
"But yes, I've told her that we would love to have her substitute for Peter," 
he said, referring to anchor Peter Jennings of "World News Tonight," although 
others also will fill in for Jennings. The same goes for her fill-in 
appearances for Ted Koppel on "Nightline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she wanted to fill in on both programs, he replied, "yes, very much 
so." 
</P>
<P>
Arledge spoke in an interview a day after Sawyer, who had been with CBS News 
since 1978 and with the high-rated "60 Minutes" for more than four years, 
signed a five-year ABC contract that reportedly will pay her close to $1.5 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, 43, remained unavailable for comment. She was said to be finishing work 
Thursday on a "60 Minutes" story. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer's defection was one of the most publicized correspondent shifts in 
network news since Barbara Walters left NBC and the "Today" show in 1976 to 
join ABC. In that deal, Walters got to break into the formerly men-only club of 
network evening news anchors when teamed with Harry Reasoner, who had left CBS, 
on ABC's weeknight newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
That union, put together before Arledge took the helm at ABC News, never caught 
on. Reasoner returned to CBS, where he is now a "60 Minutes" regular; Walters 
now co-anchors ABC's successful "20/20" newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of Sawyer becoming a permanent evening news co-anchor on ABC "has 
never been a topic of discussion" during negotiations, according to a source 
close to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The talks finally concluded Wednesday afternoon when Sawyer respectfully 
rebuffed CBS' high-level pleas to stay and signed with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Donaldson signed his own new contract with ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
The former White House correspondent said from Washington Thursday that the new 
prime-time program's format hasn't been fully hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
But Donaldson said he anticipates that he and Sawyer will co-anchor it together 
from the same locale, whether in New York or on those occasions the program 
originates from other cities in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
According to Arledge, the new series has a commitment of at least two years 
from the brass at Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., no matter what its ratings are. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has not said whether Sawyer will be replaced at "60 Minutes." There has 
been speculation, however, that Jane Wallace, the blunt, salty former "West 
57th" correspondent, may be asked to give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who left CBS News last year, last Friday hosted a CBS Entertainment 
special, "People Magazine on TV." Her contract with Current Trends, the company 
that produced it, has expired, a spokeswoman for the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who now lives in Miami, according to the spokeswoman, was not 
available for comment.

HARPSICHORDIST IGOR KIPNIS' FINGERS DANCE FROM BACH TO BRUBECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ready for Duke Ellington on a harpsichord? Igor Kipnis is. The harpsichord 
virtuoso plans to play some Ellington -- as well as some Brubeck and some 
Beatles -- at the end of his classical recital Sunday afternoon in Fullerton. 
The recital, being sponsored by the Fullerton Friends of Music, will be free. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprises a lot of people," Kipnis said on the phone from Maine, "but jazz 
sounds extremely good on the harpsichord." He had just finished playing some 
jazz, in fact, at a lunchtime concert in the cafeteria of the University of 
Maine, Portland-Gorham, where he had been in residence for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was your basic cocktail harpsichordist," he laughed. "I played Bach, the 
Beatles' 'Yesterday,' rags, blues, as well as Elizabethan harpsichord music. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were not paying any attention. It was just wallpaper to them. 
Others gathered around, listening. . . . There are a lot of people who don't 
know a lot about classical music and, what is worse, don't want to know. 
Somebody should make an effort to reach these people. I try." 
</P>
<P>
The son of Alexander Kipnis, the Russian-born Metropolitan Opera basso, the 
younger Kipnis has been trying to reach audiences since he made his harpsichord 
debut in 1959. He has given concerts around the world and has made 62 classical 
</P>
<P>
recordings (40 of them solo albums) for which he has received six Grammy 
nominations. He was named Best Harpsichordist by Keyboard Magazine in 1978, 
1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He also was influential in leading the modern revival of interest in the 
fortepiano, the successor to the harpsichord and predecessor of the modern 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
One instrument he steers away from is the modern piano, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid, with a modern piano, I'm like the old Charles Addams character on 
the beach who is getting sand kicked in his face by the local bully," he said. 
"I cannot work my technique into the requirements of a modern piano. I don't 
use my shoulders. I use the same finger technique, but the spacing (between 
keys) of a modern piano is so different." 
</P>
<P>
Kipnis said that in offering mixed repertory programs he is by no means 
abandoning the classical works upon which he built his reputation. "I have 
nothing against standard repertory," he said. "I play, with enormous enjoyment, 
the Elizabethan composers, the French composers, the meat-and-potatoes school, 
Bach and Scarlatti. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But the average person who doesn't know all that much about classical music 
may enjoy a little bit of Bach from time to time but is interested in other 
areas of music, not necessarily classical music. That is one of the reasons I'm 
getting involved more in contemporary music, in all senses, not just classical. 
</P>
<P>
"These pieces are also a great deal of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Kipnis said he would not play jazz or popular pieces on an all-Bach program 
because "I don't think that that would be very appropriate. But if it were a 
mixed program, I don't see why not. I think you can lose audiences by being too 
up-tight." 
</P>
<P>
Kipnis will start his Sunday recital with music by Bach, Soler and J. G. 
Goldberg. "I'm playing the 'Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue' -- your standard Bach 
blockbuster," he said. Also on the program will be Soler's "Fandango," which he 
described as "the closest piece to Ravel's 'Bolero' that you can get. It's an 
incredibly colorful fiesta." 
</P>
<P>
What most concerns Kipnis, however, is not programming but audience 
expectations about the size or volume of the harpsichord's sound. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people know these instruments by recordings, which are beautifully 
balanced and sound absolutely wonderful," he said. "Then they hear them live, 
very often in a hall which is antiseptic or mitigates against the real glory of 
the sound of those instruments. And at that point, you're working with several 
strikes against you. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't feel like making the effort (to listen). They just want to crank 
up the volume -- and there is no volume to crank up. That is one of the hassles 
you have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
During his long career, Kipnis has seen interest in Baroque harpsichord music 
grow to the point of lively debate about what constitutes authentic performance 
practices of the Baroque period. He regards these issues from a performer's, 
not a scholar's, point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"I do pay enormous attention to performance practice (issues)," he said. "You 
have to. That is part of the business. If I were a doctor, I would have to know 
the latest findings in medical research. But if I were treating a patient, I 
would like to have a nice bedside manner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I like performance. I don't like dead music. The paramount thing is the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be so much a reaction to a reaction. One generation to 
another, something is a reaction to something which was a reaction to a 
previous reaction. Music is in a state of flux. We are always trying to find 
the musical (Holy) Grail, which always eludes us, or there is a new set of 
directions on how to find the Grail." 
</P>
<P>
"I think of the harpsichord as a living instrument, not something relegated to 
the attic and attic-kind of material," said Kipnis, who, because he wants to 
ensure the instrument a future as well as a past, has commissioned new works 
from such contemporary composers as Ned Rorem, George Rochberg and Barbara 
Kolb. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is that it is necessary to have some 20th-Century music to play, 
mainly because I don't like having things put into their little niches. . . . I 
like the idea of propagating the instrument and making it more popular. I'd 
like to be remembered as a proselytizer." 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Kipnis will play Sunday at 3:30 p.m. at Sunny Hills High School, 1801 
Warburton Way, Fullerton. Sponsored by the Fullerton Friends of Music. 
Admission: free. Information: (714) 525-5836.

LOCAL GROUPS SHARE TAIKO DRUM HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAIL S. TAGASHIRA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, the visiting samisen master from Japan said nothing about the young 
Japanese-American taiko drum student chewing gum and blowing a bubble during a 
rehearsal of Los Angeles-based Kinnara Taiko. 
</P>
<P>
But after returning to Tokyo, the master expressed his revulsion to an American 
percussionist studying taiko in Japan, knowing his opinion would reach the 
Southern California ensemble. The master's message was clear: Tell your 
California friends that they insult the art of taiko and should not be allowed 
to use the word taiko as a part of its name. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people went through a lot of changes because that was such a 
significant incident," said Johnny Mori, 39, musical director of Kinnara, now 
in its 20th year and named for a mythical musical Buddhist being. "We thought 
about our purposes, questioned our goals and became more solidified as a unit. 
We found a new direction and accepted who and what we were." 
</P>
<P>
That was 10 years ago, and today Kinnara Taiko typifies the differences between 
Japanese-American taiko groups based here and the so-called "traditional" 
ensembles like Kodo, the "Heartbeat" drummers of Japan, who return for 
performances tonight at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium -- and Wednesday and 
Thursday at Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 30 taiko groups in the United States and Canada, seven 
of which are in Southern California. Many of them don't use taiko as 
entertainment, but as part of their culture and religion. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the large drum or odaiko used for centuries by warriors on the 
battlefield, by villagers celebrating plentiful harvests and by priests in 
temple rituals serves an important religious and cultural symbol. Kodo's 
members play a 7-foot-high odaiko whose thunderous booms reverberate when its 
players' arms slash downward to strike its surface and smaller drums mounted on 
wooden stands 2-to-3 feet above the floor. Performances often include a 
Japanese bamboo flute, bells and cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
Originally formed as Ondekoza Demon Drummers, Kodo's members have lived 
communally on the rugged and desolate island of Sado in the Japan Sea since 
1971. As Ondekoza, following rigorous training, they made a splashy 1975 U.S. 
debut by running the Boston Marathon -- and performing at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kodo's once ascetic life style and strict running regimen has been 
scaled down from two long-distance runs a day to one 10-kilometer run in the 
morning. Before last year's fifth U.S. tour, new director Yoshiaki Oi described 
Kodo's schedule as one calling for discipline, but not athletic fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
And Ondekoza too, currently headquartered in Atami just south of Tokyo in 
Shizuoka Prefecture, has scaled down its rigorous training and solemn 
performances. Directed by Den Tagayasu, Ondekoza has tailored its programs to 
appeal to wider audiences at the New Fujiya Hotel. Between 1986 and 1987, many 
members lived in Los Angeles to teach members of Zenshuji Zendeko, affiliated 
with the Zenshuji Soto Mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Ondekoza are like a group of gypsies now," said Etsuo Hongo, a former member 
of the renowned Oedo Sukeroku Taiko of Tokyo and today the director of Los 
Angeles Matsuri Taiko, made up of 11 members who rehearse in the basement of 
Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple near Little Tokyo. Formed in 1977, Hongo's 
group -- like West Covina's 24-member Taiko Group -- is not formally affiliated 
with the church. But Los Angeles Matsuri Taiko's reputation is one of 
strictness, constantly striving for authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Where most ensembles construct their own drums from cowhide and oak kegs, 
Hongo's Matsuri Taiko drummers have spent thousands of dollars on drums made by 
master craftsmen in Japan. And whenever a new member signs up to learn taiko, 
he or she may be allowed to hit only rubber tires for months before striking a 
drum. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a responsibility to the audience to present traditional taiko," Hongo 
said, pointing to third-generation Sansei drummers who neither speak Japanese 
nor have ever been in Japan. "When Japanese people see us perform and see our 
faces are Japanese and hear us play like Japanese, they think we must be 
Japanese from Japan. They ask us, 'Where are you from?' and that makes me feel 
good." 
</P>
<P>
But for most taiko groups, the focus is on religion and culture rather than 
athleticism and musical authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
For Zenshuji Zendeko, teachings of Zen Buddhism serve as its foundation for 
existence. Three to four times a week, Zendeko's rehearsals begin with 15-25 
minutes of meditation. Even children as young as 5 meditate. "It gives them an 
inner calm and a peaceful feeling," said Hiroko Seki, general manager and one 
of Zendeko's 18 performers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to meditation, some groups consider sutra chanting an important 
part of taiko. Orange County's Daion Taiko Group, formed in 1981 by members of 
Orange County Buddhist Church in Anaheim, literally took its name from a sutra 
which translates to mean "great sound of enlightenment." 
</P>
<P>
And six adults and seven children who are members of Free Spirit Taiko Group at 
Gardena Buddhist Church will consider adding sutra chanting either to 
performances or rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are, after all, a church-sponsored organization," chairman Tom Fukuman 
said. "We have an obligation to teach Buddhistic ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of Senshin Buddhist Church, L.A.'s Kinnara Taiko traces 
its origins to 1969, making it one of the oldest taiko groups in the country. 
Since it was incorporated, Kinnara has expanded its focus to classical Japanese 
dance and classical drama. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through everything," Kinnara's director Mori said of the group's past 
two decades. "We've done stretching and calisthenics, we even did Zazen 
meditation and we tried chanting. In fact, that's how Kinnara got started 20 
years ago -- by chanting." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what his orientation, the drummer's ultimate goal, according to the 
Rev. Arthur Takemoto of Vista Buddhist Church, should be to find joy in playing 
and in the drum's sound.

CHINESE-LANGUAGE NEWSCAST WILL BOW IN SAN FRANCISCO

<P>
Eyeing the market for Asian viewers, a foreign-language television station here 
embarks Monday on a daring venture in Pacific Rim broadcasting when it starts 
the nation's first live, local, Chinese-language newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at KTSF-TV Channel 26 could not hide their excitement this week as 
they introduced their "Chinese News at 9" team, a young crew of bilingual 
broadcasters from Hong Kong, to the local media at a restaurant in San 
Francisco's Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is right, we've got the money and we're going ahead with it," said 
Mei-Ling Sze, an anchorwoman who was watched by 2 million viewers at her 
previous job with Hong Kong Television Broadcasting, one of three major news 
stations in the British colony. "This is really a big challenge." 
</P>
<P>
During a hectic rehearsal Tuesday, the 27-year-old Sze primped before the 
cameras and adjusted her pearl necklace. She offered counsel in Cantonese to 
her green co-anchor, Philip Choi, also 27. 
</P>
<P>
The mock broadcast went smoothly except for minor miscues. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Choi missed a story and the savvy Sze picked it up without 
flinching. A video on Afghan refugees was run while the anchors were reading a 
cute feature on the 50th anniversary of "Gone With the Wind." And the anchors' 
navy-blue blazers and black hair blended into the set's poorly lit background, 
a slab of plywood painted a dark, rich brown to resemble Chinese lacquer boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were in a shambles a week ago," said a red-eyed Michael Sherman, KTSF's 
station manager and a former marketing executive for MGM studios. "But we're 
getting calmer and more in control. Seven rehearsals down and three to go." 
</P>
<P>
KTSF is gambling that its newscast will boost the audience for its other 
Chinese shows, now estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 a day. Executives also hope 
their move will give them a stronger foothold in the fast-growing Asian market 
of the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to showcase the news," Sherman said. "We know it won't be a 
money-maker the first year, but it will certainly draw an audience and become a 
good lead-in for our other programs." 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen and Arbitron collect little data on viewers who speak foreign tongues. 
So, two years ago, KTSF hired the SRI Research Center in Lincoln, Neb., to 
survey Chinese television watchers. The findings confirmed that Chinese viewers 
are usually well educated and have more buying power than advertisers 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
So far, commercial time has been bought by the Bank of America, United 
Airlines, Cathay-Pacific, Lucky Stores, the California Lottery, Levitz and 
others. Sales are ahead of projections, according to general manager Brian 
Holton. 
</P>
<P>
The newscast will be a rougher ride. Despite a shoestring budget of $400,000 a 
year and a skeleton staff of eight young journalists and translators, news 
director Rose Shirinian hopes to put on a strong half-hour newscast Monday 
through Friday. Compared to KTSF, a typical local news station may boast an 
editorial staff of 100 and an annual news budget of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to play to the local community -- that's our goal," said 
Shirinian, a public affairs specialist and the producer of PBS documentaries on 
Taiwan and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a bridge between the Chinese community and the outside world," 
said Choi, who took a huge pay cut from his reporting job at Hong Kong 
Television to work in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A sample newscast this week covered a mix of national and international news: 
the trial of Oliver North, the Alaskan cold wave, baby boomers in China, the 
latest financial news from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo. Another story 
analyzed the huge wild dog population in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
KTSF also broadcasts shows in Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Hindi, 
Farsi, Italian and Greek. The 13-year-old independent station is owned by the 
Lincoln Broadcasting Co., which is run by Lillian Lincoln Howell, the heiress 
to an arc-welding fortune.

STUDENTS ATTACK WORLD PROBLEMS AT MODEL U.N.

By KIMBERLY E. CARTER, Kimberly Esrig Carter, 14, is a freshman at Laguna Beach 
High School, where she is business manager for Brush &amp; Palette, the student 
newspaper, and a member of the Academic Decathlon team.

<P>
"Simulation can be stimulation." 
</P>
<P>
Those were the words of Alexander Dalin, a Stanford University professor of 
political science and history, in his opening speech for the Model United 
Nations conference last November in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Model United Nations conferences feature student delegations from high schools 
and colleges -- each representing a different country -- trying to discuss, 
debate and resolve such world situations as human rights, global conflicts and 
the uses of outer space. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a student simulation of what the United Nations is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"Model U.N. has increased many students' awareness of the need for world 
cooperation and the ever-increasing global interdependence we find ourselves in 
both economically and politically," said Rome Friesen, international relations 
teacher and Model United Nations adviser at Laguna Beach High School. "And the 
need to compromise in solving our differences if the world community is to live 
into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
Friesen and 28 Laguna Beach students made a 9-hour, 350-mile trek up the coast 
of California to attend the Stanford conference, one of 50 such meetings held 
throughout the school year and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Model United Nations, which was begun in 1954 at Harvard University, is merely 
an updated version of the 1930s simulations based on the League of Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Months before each conference, participating schools are assigned the countries 
their students will represent as well as the areas of discussion, which can 
vary from meeting to meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Upon its arrival, the Laguna Beach delegation was impressed by the beauty of 
the Stanford campus as it made its way to Kresge Auditorium to check in. There, 
the students were given placards and name tags identifying them by the names of 
the countries they represented -- the Soviet Union, El Salvador, Iran, etc. 
Also, each tag had a different colored dot on it, signifying different 
committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
As the students entered the auditorium, they came face to face for the first 
time with the delegates from the competing high schools. Feelings of 
anticipation, apprehension and excitement filled the air. Most were probably 
wondering if their months of preparation for this weekend would be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Dalin opened the conference with a speech on the international 
perspective, both past and present, of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to be part of this program," said Dalin at the beginning of his 
speech. "I applaud your involvement in Model United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
A roll call followed and a quorum was established with the presence of 27 
nations, represented by 17 California high schools and a total of 280 
delegates. Laguna Beach and Mission Viejo high schools were the only Orange 
County participants. 
</P>
<P>
After roll call, the delegations broke into separate committee meetings in 
classrooms throughout the campus. The goal of each committee was to come up 
with an agreeable solution -- in the form of a committee-written resolution -- 
to its conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"In Model U.N., we hope to enrich everyone's knowledge of world history and the 
way people interact," said Flavio Salinas, a Stanford student who was vice 
chairman for the "Crisis in Central America and Angola" committee. "We hope to 
sharpen participants' debating skills and make them into good listeners." 
</P>
<P>
Committee rules were quite formal. Each delegate had a list of the various 
motions, their rules, rule numbers, their purposes, and the number of votes 
required to pass each. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates were allowed only 3 minutes to make a speech and 30 seconds for a 
comment on a speech. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas and the chairman evaluated their committee's work to determine the 
recipient of the Gavel Award, presented at the close of the convention to the 
best delegates in each committee. It was at this time that the term gavel 
hunters was first mentioned. These were students, according to Annie McQuade, a 
senior delegate from Laguna Beach, who participated in Model U.N. conferences 
solely for the purpose of winning the Gavel Award. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the students that prepare for many months, but don't prepare to 
solve the problem," she explained. "If you want to solve the problem, you don't 
come with resolutions, you come and work on it together with other countries. 
They (gavel hunters) try to dominate the whole committee." 
</P>
<P>
These students often refused to compromise their country's stands for fear they 
might jeopardize the final resolutions and their chances of winning the award. 
</P>
<P>
After several speeches had been made, which were followed by a seemingly 
endless number of comments, it was caucus time. 
</P>
<P>
A caucus is a timed break during which delegates could informally discuss 
proposed courses of action with delegates from allied countries. It's also a 
time when opposing countries could work out compromises. 
</P>
<P>
And so the evening went -- speeches, comments and caucuses -- until 11:30, when 
the committee finally adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 6 a.m. wake-up call came early for most. Once again, delegates 
assembled in their committees for all-day meetings. The "Crisis in Central 
America and Angola" committee continued its discussion of conflicts, but was 
interrupted by an "emergency." 
</P>
<P>
These emergencies are obstacles added to the talks by conference organizers in 
an attempt to make things more interesting. In this case, the emergency was 
news of a surprise military attack that spread into a village, killing most of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1 1/2-hour discussion, the emergency was laid to rest and the talks 
continued. Soon, a motion was made to put aside discussion of policies and 
begin discussion of solutions, which would take the form of resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meetings ended at 5 p.m. That evening, most of Laguna Beach's 
delegation boarded its bus for an hour's drive to San Francisco, where the 
students ate Italian food and toured Coit Tower and Pier 39. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach students pay all the expenses of their conference trips, which 
have since included one to Mission Viejo High School and will feature a meeting 
at UC Berkeley in March, an international conference in New York in April and a 
meeting in San Diego later in the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning brought about the close of the Stanford convention. Laguna Beach 
students David Yates, Adam Donner, R.P. McKeon, Robin Austin and Victor Infante 
received awards as outstanding delegates at the closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
However, awards were the last things on the minds of most delegates in the 
convention's waning moments as committee members made frantic efforts to come 
up with final resolutions. Though some were reached, none totally represented 
the desires of all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates were reminded of the words of Dalin in his opening speech: "The 
United Nations is unable to accomplish many things, and it was made that way 
deliberately. It doesn't have either the authority, resources or mechanism. No 
international organization can solve all global problems." 
</P>
<P>
And that is the case at Model United Nations conferences, too.

SMITHKLINE MAY SPIN OFF HEALTH CARE UNITS, INCLUDING 2 HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SmithKline Beckman Corp., which stunned Wall Street last week when its 
president abruptly resigned, is considering spinning off its profitable 
health-care units, including two in Orange County, Chairman Henry Wendt said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a commitment to unlock the value of our health-care businesses for the 
benefit of shareholders," Wendt told reporters after a meeting with securities 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to unlock and unbundle the potential value of these units by 
making them more separate and more visible," Wendt told the analysts. He said 
the moves must be "managed and controlled carefully and with discipline" but 
provided no further details on the plans. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline's shares closed down $1 at $51.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Wendt targeted the company's Irvine-based Allergan Inc. eye-care division and 
its SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratory network of testing laboratories, as well 
as Beckman Instruments in Fullerton, for a partial sale. The Beckman subsidiary 
was partially spun off last year to a generally cool reception from Wall 
Street. SmithKline, based in Philadelphia, sold 17% of Beckman to the public 
and hinted at other spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan makes eye-care and skin-care products and employs 2,700 people in 
Southern California, according to the company. Sales rose 37% last year, to 
$756 million. An Allergan spokesman said again Thursday that Allergan has not 
been told whether part or all of the company will be sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments employs 3,500 in the region in the manufacture of medical 
instruments. Sales were $770 million last year, up 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Bio-Science is headquartered outside Philadelphia but employs 1,500 and 
operates a big laboratory in Van Nuys. The unit had sales of $675 million last 
year, up 57%. 
</P>
<P>
Wendt said he "shouldered the blame" for the drop in U.S. drug sales and 
acknowledged that SmithKline has not yet solved its strategic problem of 
excessive dependency on its anti-ulcer drug Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline, the nation's eighth-largest drug company, has been striving to 
restore investor confidence due to declining sales of Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tagamet sales, which account for half of SmithKline's total drug 
sales, dropped to $1.02 billion from $1.13 billion in 1987. In the United 
States, Tagamet sales fell 24.4% to $499 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been a persistently rumored takeover target since it first 
announced a drop in Tagamet sales last June. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President George Ebright resigned over differences regarding the 
future direction of the company, and some analysts said Ebright balked at 
Wendt's plans to give greater autonomy to the company's individual divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation sparked speculation that SmithKline could be sold or would be 
forced to spin off additional units. 
</P>
<P>
PaineWebber analyst Ron Nordmann said after Thursday's meeting that "management 
has held its plan for the future close to the vest," but added that investors 
should be reasonably reassured that the company's business is basically solid. 
</P>
<P>
But Neil Sweig, of Prudential Bache, said the meeting held no surprises, and 
added: "Fundamentally the company in 1989 is weak and the stock will be 
significantly weakened." 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline's rise and fall have been closely tied to Tagamet. For a number of 
years after it was introduced in 1976, Tagamet was the biggest-selling 
prescription drug of all time and vaulted SmithKline into a multibillion-dollar 
company. 
</P>
<P>
However, with other drug companies making inroads into the lucrative anti-ulcer 
market, SmithKline has been scrambling, without success, to find another 
blockbuster drug. 
</P>
<P>
John Chappell, president of Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories, SmithKline's 
drug division, said Thursday that new strategies for Tagamet include expanding 
its usage to non-ulcer ailments like heartburn. He also said the company would 
move aggressively to win regulatory approval for an over-the-counter form of 
Tagamet before its patent expires in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline has already taken several steps to address its problems apart from 
the partial sale of Beckman Instruments, including sharply reducing its 
headquarters staff, eliminating 1,600 positions company-wide and taking a 
$292.6-million charge against its third-quarter earnings for restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company earned $229.2 million, including the third-quarter 
restructuring charge, compared to $570.1 million earned in 1987. Sales rose to 
$4.75 billion from $4.33 billion.

The U.S. Supreme Court's December decision not to hear a case challenging the 
constitutionality of police sobriety checks left local police agencies free to 
run such holiday road checks. Just seven county cities utilized the checks, 
though. Here are the results, with drunk-driving arrests reported for those 
cities that did not use the checkpoints:

THE ALCOHOL TOLL 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 10 months of 1988, alcohol-related traffic accidents killed 
more people on county streets and roads than was the case for any of the nine 
preceding full years. Between January and October, there were 151 fatal 
accidents (also more than any of the nine years before) that killed 168 people. 
Here's a look at the 1988 monthly trend as well as the nine years before:

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for December.

<P>
Actor Todd Bridges, best known for his role as Gary Coleman's brother on the 
television show "Diff'rent Strokes," was arrested for investigation of 
attempted murder after allegedly shooting another man five times, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, 23, and Harvey Duckett, 30, were ordered held without bail at the 
Parker Center Jail. Police Sgt. Doug Tantee said they were arrested Thursday 
night in connection with the shooting and stabbing of Kenneth Clay, who was in 
critical but stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. 
Clay told police he confronted the two men inside a vacant home that he was 
supposed to be watching on West 65th Street, a neighborhood plagued by rock 
cocaine dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges has had several previous brushes with the law. In 1987 he received a 
suspended sentence after pleading no contest to charges of making a bomb threat 
and in 1983 he paid a $240 fine for carrying a concealed firearm.

Actor Griffin O'Neal was released from jail today after serving 15 days for 
violating terms of probation for his involvement in the 1986 boating death of 
the son of director Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, the son of actor Ryan O'Neal, said he made a few friends and "actually 
was pretty well liked" during his time in Anne Arundel County Detention Center. 
"I'm going home now," he said, to "hold onto my animals and my girlfriend." 
O'Neal, 24, was given an 18-day sentence for not performing 400 hours of 
community service ordered by the judge who found him guilty of reckless boating 
in the accident that killed Gian-Carlo Coppola. O'Neal got three days off for 
good behavior.

Former White House aide Michael K. Deaver today abandoned his appeal of perjury 
convictions for lying about his lobbying, saying he wanted to "put this period 
of my life behind me." 
</P>
<P>
The former top adviser to former President Ronald Reagan and a close friend of 
the former First Family said he is dropping the appeal "with the firm belief 
that I was not guilty of the charges of which I was convicted." Deaver also 
said he could not continue the "financial burden" of the appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyers have said that Deaver, a recovering alcoholic, is unable to find 
work. The investigation by an independent counsel forced Deaver to close his 
lobbying business. In 1986, the height of his lobbying career, Deaver had an 
income of $527,958.

The judge at Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial selected four more people as 
prospective jurors today, including one who said she doesn't pay attention to 
news because it's "depressing" and thinks the controversy over North is 
"boring." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a secretary to a hospital director, said her mother, who lives with 
her, pays such close attention to current events that "I call her 'news media.' 
" When her mother approaches her about the news, "I always tell her to get out 
of my room. I don't want to hear it," the woman said. U.S. District Judge 
Gerhard A. Gesell qualified her for the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were rejected for the pool, including a businesswoman who said 
North was involved in "money and arms . . . on an international scale." She 
said she knew that North had "a boss named (John M.) Poindexter" and "he had a 
blonde secretary," a reference to Fawn Hall.

The first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years could come as early as April, the 
Soviet Embassy said today, after the Chinese government officially invited 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government said Foreign Minister Qian Qichen proposed the visit in 
talks with his visiting Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who 
"accepted the invitation and expressed his gratitude." Soviet Embassy spokesman 
Viatcheslav Duhin said an April date for Gorbachev's visit was anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev would be the first Soviet leader to visit China since Nikita S. 
Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959. A year later, relations between 
the countries deteriorated over ideological and strategic differences, and the 
Soviets halted technical and military aid to China.

Stock prices showed little change today, faced with news of 
stronger-than-expected employment growth at the start of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25, reducing its 
gain for the week to 8.39 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 778 up, 634 down and 525 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 172.98 million shares, against 183.43 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index edged up .15 to 166.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported this morning that payroll employment grew by 
408,000 jobs in January, well above advance estimates on Wall Street. (Story, 
Page 2.) 
</P>
<P>
That evidence of continued strong momentum in economic growth quickly increased 
expectations of further credit tightening by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rises 
</P>
<P>
Traders' fears of higher interest rates apparently were offset to a significant 
extent, however, by the dollar's rise in foreign exchange after the report was 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
A sustained rally by the dollar would stand to attract money from overseas into 
U.S. investments. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also said money managers who had been left behind in the market's 
recent rally were still engaged in "catch-up" buying each time stock prices 
pulled back a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading today as the Labor Department's report on 
nonfarm jobs triggered concerns that the economy is expanding more rapidly than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/16 point, or about $4.40 per 
$1,000 face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price, rose to 8.85% from 8.8% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The government report was viewed as an indication of rapid economic expansion, 
triggering some inflationary fears, analysts said. Trading was moderate over 
the course of the morning, with waves of heavy activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern is that the Federal Reserve will have to push short-term interest 
rates higher to slow down the economy, so we've seen the market sell off a 
little bit," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets 
Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/8%, up from 9% late Thursday.

talemate between the world's leading coffee producers and consumers threatens 
the survival of an international price support agreement beyond September, 
International Coffee Organization delegates said today. 
</P>
<P>
At preliminary talks this week in London, delegates to the 74-nation ICO failed 
to make tangible progress toward an agreement to set export quotas and regulate 
the coffee market into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
No new ideas emerged even though both sides hope to have a new deal ready by 
the spring, the delegates reported. Talks begin in earnest Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers such as the United States, West Germany and other European countries 
want a revamped agreement, rejecting the idea of simply extending the present 
pact beyond September. But producers favor simply modifying the present pact, 
which has not changed much since beginning in the 1960s. ICO consumers complain 
that they have to buy coffee at ICO-supported prices while sellers are free to 
make cheap coffee sales to consumer nations outside the pact -- such as East 
Bloc and Arab countries.

Iran has reversed its policy of refusing to borrow from foreign banks as 
another step toward rebuilding an economy devastated after eight years of war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's New York Times, Gholamreza Agazadeh, 
Iran's minister of oil and mineral wealth, said that Iran would borrow for 
revenue-producing projects and that such borrowing would not exceed $3 billion 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"In my country a big debate has gone on," he said. "Now we have decided the No. 
1 priority in this country is reconstruction of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini banned such loans when he took power 10 
years ago and established an Islamic government. 
</P>
<P>
Recent changes in government policy, including a decision to reopen a natural 
gas pipeline to the Soviet Union announced in December, reflected a decision to 
pursue a more pragmatic approach to solving the country's woes, Agazadeh said.

Four top executives at General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. have 
resigned in what one described as a "difference of opinion regarding the firm's 
future," according to published reports today. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations occurred less than two weeks after General Electric put the 
head of its own investment banking unit in charge of Kidder's profitable 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Madden, head of investment banking and the highest-ranking Kidder 
veteran, was among those who submitted his resignation Thursday, according to 
today's editions of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Madden and other sources told the newspapers that other Kidder executives were 
also considering resigning and that the firm was paralyzed over concerns about 
the firm's future, the newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
Kidder Chairman Silas S. Cathcart was quoted as saying the situation was not so 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss a few people, but life will go on," the Journal quoted 
Cathcart as saying. He also added that GE and Kidder are developing a new 
business strategy and that "it's a good plan and everybody agrees with it."

Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. will change its focus from land 
development to income-producing properties and will cut its work force in half 
after selling Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Keating told reporters during an informal gathering in his office that the sale 
of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings to an investment group is critical to survival 
of American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
He denied rumors that his company is on the verge of bankruptcy, although he 
said it has been caught in the recession in Arizona's construction and real 
estate industries. American Continental reported a $38-million loss for the 
third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Its fourth-quarter financial statement has not been released. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental announced in December an agreement to sell Lincoln Savings 
to an investment group headed by Spencer Scott of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said that he expects California and federal regulators to approve the 
sale next month.

The New Orleans Saints will return to the University of Wisconsin, LaCrosse, to 
train for the 1989 season, president and general manager Jim Finks announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints moved their training camp from Hammond, La., to LaCrosse last year, 
in part to escape the heat and humidity of a south Louisiana summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reasons for returning to LaCrosse are the same as 1988," Finks said. "The 
university has fine facilities, plenty of field space and an overall good 
atmosphere for a training camp." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints camp will run from July 21-Aug. 25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints will host the Chicago Bears for three days of workouts during 
training camp, Finks said. It will be the second training season the Saints and 
the Bears have worked out together. New Orleans left its camp in Hammond to 
drill with the Bears in Platteville, Wis., in 1987. No times have been set for 
the 1989 workouts, Finks said.

Ondrej Nepela, the 1972 Olympic figure skating champion from Czechoslovakia, 
has died in a West German hospital after a long illness, the West German Ice 
Skating Union said today. He was 38. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela died late Thursday in a Mannheim hospital. The federation's statement 
did not specify Nepela's illness. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela became Czechoslovakia's first Olympic figure skating champion when he 
won the men's title at the 1972 Winter Games in Saporro, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He reigned as world champion from 1971 to 1973 and won five European titles 
between 1969 and 1973. Nepela then joined the American Holiday on Ice 
professional show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Nepela came to Mannheim and became the coach of West German figure 
skater Claudia Leistner, who won the European title last month in Birmingham, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela was hospitalized after the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and never 
returned to the ice.

YANKEES SIGN GUIDRY FOR ONE YEAR

<P>
Ron Guidry, the Yankees captain who was let go in December as too old, returned 
to New York today, agreeing to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry, the 38-year-old left-hander who had led the Yankees pitching staff for 
most of his 12-year career, had been talking with the Toronto Blue Jays and the 
Minnesota Twins, but instead, he decided to return to the only major league 
team he has ever played for. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry, a 20-game winner three times, became a free agent Dec. 20 when the 
Yankees failed to offer him a 1989 contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to know what took you so long," Guidry said to Yankees general 
manager Bob Quinn during a telephone conference call. "Good things come to he 
who waits." 
</P>
<P>
For the Yankees, getting Guidry back was a complete turn from their plans to go 
with a younger pitching staff in 1989. Quinn, however, said that the Yankees 
always wanted Guidry back. 
</P>
<P>
"We had never said we didn't want to sign Ron Guidry," Quinn said. "In fact, I 
don't think we saw the real Ron Guidry in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Guidry missed the first half of the 1988 season while recovering from shoulder 
surgery. He went 2-3 with a 4.18 earned-run average in 56 innings.
