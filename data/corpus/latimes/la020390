If I still had all the money I've lost wagering on favorites ridden by Bill

Now that the Shoe is calling it a career, do you think he would consider 
spending his retirement standing out in my front yard in his jockey silks? I

DAILEY HELPS SEATTLE WIN; CAMPBELL SCORES 44 AGAINST CELTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seattle SuperSonics were desperate. They had lost 12 consecutive road games 
and lost two outstanding guards. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Friday night's game at Indianapolis against the Indiana Pacers, 
the SuperSonics signed Quintin Dailey, who had blown a chance to play with the 
Lakers during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey , who was out of shape and not too dependable in the week he spent in 
Laker training camp, paid an instant dividend. 
</P>
<P>
After grabbing a loose ball with only seven seconds left, Dailey was fouled and 
made the first of two free throws to give the SuperSonics an 87-86 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, who was averaging 15.6 points for Sioux Falls of the Continental 
Basketball Assn., played 25 minutes in his Seattle debut and contributed 11 
points. He signed a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are paying the bulk of Dailey's $400,000. But they lost interest 
when he showed up at camp 25 pounds overweight, then in a week missed a plane 
flight, a meeting and a practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers had a chance to win after Dailey missed his second free throw, but 
Detlef Schrempf was called for a charge with 1.1 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey was signed after Sedale Threatt joined Dale Ellis on the injured list. 
Both will be out for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like Ellis and Threatt," said Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff, "Quintin 
is a pro." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 116, Boston 105 -- Former Laker Tony Campbell scored 12 of his 
career-high 44 points in the last three minutes at Minneapolis to lead the 
expansion Timberwolves to their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who was 15 for 28 from the field, sank a jumper with 1:30 left to 
give Minnesota a 103-102 lead. Campbell then made six consecutive free throws 
as 35,713 fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird was only seven for 17 from the field, but the Celtic veteran was 
four for four from the line and has now made 63 consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 119, Milwaukee 109 -- Charles Barkley has been saying all season 
the 76ers are one of the best teams in the NBA. People are finally beginning to 
be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new believers are the Bucks. The 76ers spotted the Bucks a 13-point, 
third-quarter lead at Philadelphia, then roared back to win their 10th in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 33 points and 15 rebounds, and the 76ers pulled away in the closing 
minutes to move back into a tie with New York for first place in the Atlantic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 118, Charlotte 107 -- It has been a long time since a rookie 
dominated games in the NBA the way 7-1 David Robinson of the Spurs does. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Charlotte, the former Navy star had the kind of triple-double 
only a good big man can have. He scored 27 points, had 15 rebounds and blocked 
11 shots in an awesome performance. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has developed so quickly, the Spurs are on a pace that would set a 
league record for improvement from one season to the next. 
</P>
<P>
The season that Larry Bird joined them (1979-80), the Boston Celtics improved 
by 32 victories. The Spurs are 30-13. A 24-15 record the rest of the way would 
break the record for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 108, Sacramento 99 -- Jeff Malone scored 40 points at Landover, Md., 
and rookie Ed Horton chipped in with 18 as the Bullets handed the Kings their 
fourth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who are 2-19 on the road, pulled to within five points in the fourth 
quarter only to have Malone make two baskets in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 105, Dallas 92 -- Karl Malone had five of his 30 points in an 18-4 
fourth-quarter run at Salt Lake City that broke open a tough game and ended the 
Mavericks' seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 128, New Jersey 109 -- Manute Bol blocked 13 shots at Oakland and 
the Warriors coasted to another easy victory, improving their record at home to 
18-5. DAN HAFNER

FACES . . . : A LITTLE STAGE MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Performers talk about the magic of the stage, but Madge Sinclair is taking it 
seriously for her role tonight in Los Angeles Theatre Center's world premiere 
of Anna Deavere Smith's "Piano." 
</P>
<P>
Though her character, a maid named Suzanna, may seem to have a humble position 
in the Cuban family household at the center of Smith's play, she is a woman of 
great power. Sinclair says: "She is a priestess in santeria, the earth-based 
religion that is very extensive throughout Latin American and the Caribbean. 
The story is set in 1898, when Cubans were fighting their Spanish occupiers, 
and the family is torn apart by the arrival of a brother, who is in the Spanish 
army. She uses santeria to help the family." 
</P>
<P>
What some perjoratively label as voodoo, the Jamaican-born Sinclair knows from 
some personal experience. "In Jamaica, it's called Pocomania -- little madness. 
It's a cross between the holy roller church and African santeria beliefs. My 
grandfather was a practioner, an obeah man, who used herbal healing methods." 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair was drawn to acting in school, but in the '60s Jamaica had no 
professional theater so she headed for New York. 
</P>
<P>
It's been uphill since: acting at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre in the early 
'70s ("the Public was just starting then, and we would do fundraising shows on 
an outdoor flatbed truck"); landing the role of Bell in the first edition of 
"Roots"; garnering three Emmy nominations as nurse Ernestine Shoop in "Trapper 
John, M.D.," and winning a 1987 Los Angeles Emmy for PBS' "Look Away." She 
played Eddie Murphy's mother in "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people get snooty about it," she says, "but I like working for TV. I can 
finish something and see it the next week." But Sinclair remains with the 
theater and the chance to "speak wonderful language. And I've been with LATC 
for four years because it reminds me of the Public Theatre. You may either hate 
or love the shows, but there's always something interesting going on." ROBERT

POLICE RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Michael Wilmington's Jan. 12 review of "Internal Affairs": 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if a more sensitive reviewer or a more aware (daring?) movie maker 
would have questioned the screenwriter's gratuitous use of a "lesbian partner" 
as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
I can almost picture the studio conferences over this issue: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's have a woman partner -- that's 'in.' " 
</P>
<P>
"OK, but we can't have another love interest subplot -- let's make her a 
lesbian, that's sexually safe and 'in'!" 
</P>
<P>
And did even one rational voice suggest that maybe a good-looking heterosexual 
man and an attractive heterosexual woman can work together, professionally and 
respectfully , without "doing it"? Oh, no, that's dull city, eh, guys?

FACES . . . : FROM FILMS TO CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olivia Barash is probably best known to audiences from her role as Emilio 
Estevez's UFO-nut girlfriend in the perpetually rented cult-film favorite "Repo 
Man" (in which she uttered the "Casablanca"-like immortal closing words, "I'm 
glad I tortured you!"). It was a somewhat sexy role, but one contrived to make 
her seem even more girlish and certainly more naive than her age at the time, 
which was a young 18. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on hiatus from acting and fronting a band called 13th Step five years 
later, Barash is a regular on the local rock club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I always play younger" in the movies, she says, but on the concert stage she 
seems to be playing much older, much more world-wise -- exuding the betrayed 
fury of a Melissa Etheridge, but with a tougher, meatier musical edge. 
</P>
<P>
"People who come knowing me as an actress probably don't expect that it's going 
to be as moving an experience," says Barash, "because a lot of the actresses 
who sing do the disco kind of songs that are written for them. And this stuff 
really comes from the heart and soul and gut. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a musician first. This sounds really corny, but I think it's 
my calling. But there's this taboo about being an actress and a singer, and 
since I had films out before my music is out in front of the public, I'm gonna 
have to really prove that I'm gonna knock their socks off as a musician." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if being an actress is a slight liability to one's legitimate rock rep, 
having been in "Repo Man" isn't: "The people that are into that movie are 
people that would be into our music." 
</P>
<P>
Barash's next film role (her first since playing an SLA member in Paul 
Schrader's "Patty Hearst") will be a cameo as a Sunset Strip folk singer in the 
Oliver Stone's upcoming "The Doors." 
</P>
<P>
But right now acting remains secondary to 13th Step. The guitar-based quartet 
has finished a six-song EP to be released in April; the live schedule includes 
stops tonight at Al's Bar, Wednesday at Club Lingerie and frequent appearances 
at the Coconut Teaszer. CHRIS WILLMAN

DANCE THEATRE OF HARLEM OFFERS 'OTHELLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Butler's "Othello" is lurid, hard-sell junk: a one-act story ballet that 
reduces its literary source to drivel and its dancers to pawns. 
</P>
<P>
This is surely no place for Virginia Johnson, a lyric-dramatic dancer of great 
refinement -- but there she was, at Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Thursday, 
squandering her artistry on the new Dance Theatre of Harlem production as if 
Butler's sleazy 1978 vehicle might be worthy of her talents. 
</P>
<P>
Fat chance. Butler reconceives Shakespeare as a crude display of lifts: Othello 
lifting Desdemona (under blue light), then lifting Iago (under red light) and 
eventually, after Iago lifts him, strangling Desdemona in mid-lift (under 
lavender light) -- all to Dvorak's concert overture. 
</P>
<P>
When the dancers are momentarily freed from hoisting or being hoisted, there's 
still scarcely any dancing for them. Desdemona's big solo is mostly 
hands-on-heart, hands-on-throat, hands-reaching-out: bald gestural rhetoric 
disconnected from any dance impulse. Johnson does what she can. 
</P>
<P>
In a ballet requiring nothing but his muscle power, Hugues Magen manages to 
give Othello glints of soul, and Tyrone Brooks exudes feline menace as Iago, 
the "other woman" role in this triangle. David LaMarche conducts capably. 
</P>
<P>
Equally unconventional, but more intriguing: Royston Maldoom's "Doina," with 
the Harlem woman wearing hooded, mesh body-stockings as they define sculptural 
shapes in place against a green Rose window. Pan pipes and organ tones (on 
tape) enhance the sense of exotic, cloistered ritual. Later on, a pas de deux 
(for the limpid Yvonne Hall and the powerful Eddie J. Shellman) becomes 
something of a spatial and emotional invasion -- though Maldoom never develops 
the contrasts between quasi-sacred corps and his implicitly profane soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond these novelties, this second Harlem program of the season remains wholly 
familiar. John Taras' "Firebird" again finds Stephanie Dabney mesmerizing the 
multitudes by darting her head, fluttering her hands and skimming the stage in 
majestic bourrees. The noble Ronald Perry and gracious Lorraine Graves are each 
highly accomplished in other leading roles. Milton Rosenstock leads a taut, 
atmospheric account of Stravinsky's score. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Hindemith's music for "The Four Temperaments" sounds awfully 
feeble under LaMarche. However, Balanchine's choreography receives the usual 
scrupulous Harlem treatment, with Christina Johnson superbly vanquishing the 
technical hazards of the third theme and Gregory Jackson exceptionally 
promising if uneven in the Melancholic variation. 
</P>
<P>
Other sections are, perhaps, less ideally cast, but this performance has too 
much warmth and style for any regrets. After 20 years, Dance Theatre of Harlem 
may still be addicted to trashy dance-drama, but it continues to dance 
Balanchine with love and care. That, always, is something to celebrate.

LOCK-UP LETS LOOSE AT CLUB LINGERIE

As a Silverlake performance artist, Brian Grillo undulated through fish dances, 
writhed upside down in a loincloth from the rafters of a nightclub, and led 
campy neo-Motown revues. But as the frontman for Lock-Up, the funky Hollywood 
band that performed at Club Lingerie on Thursday, Grillo did a remarkable 
impersonation of a talented regular-guy rock singer. 
</P>
<P>
It's as if Eric Bogosian were actually to become a talk-show host or Ann 
Magnuson a heavy-metal queen, and did it better than the guys they were 
parodying. Thursday Lock-Up's arty edges were limited to the fine 
Basquiat-esque totem-pole-style backdrop; this was rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo belts like Huey Lewis or somebody, and dances a modified version of the 
Springsteen Shuffle. His band blasts tight Ohio Players riffs by way of Guns N' 
Roses -- hey, Lock-Up records for Geffen now -- that sound more like decent 
commercial hard rock than like the atonal ecstasies of, say, the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers. People danced to this stuff, even some of the jaded industry crowd, 
and women screamed like Beatlemaniacs during the ballad. JONATHAN GOLD

JOE SATRIANI STRIKES THE RIGHT CHORD WITH AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the '60s, rock-guitar god Eric Clapton once said that when a player is 
at his peak, on certain levels he's talking to the audience -- and they 
thoroughly understand him. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Thursday, in the first of a two-night 
stand, hard-rock guitarist Joe Satriani held some rambling, melodramatic 
conversations with the audience, which was clearly in tune with him most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Satriani, considered by many the best hard-rock instrumentalist to emerge in 
the '80s, really is good. Even if you're skeptical about the whole guitar-hero 
genre, you might like him. Those flurries of piercing notes and those 
explosions of thunderous chords really do add up to cohesive dramatic 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
But it's easy for this kind of player to fall into arid stretches where, for 
all his effort, he's simply not connecting with the audience. These are the 
inevitable detours that come as part of speeding around the cluttered aural 
landscape in search of paths to glorious dramatic peaks. Some turns lead to the 
right roads and sometimes they don't. Most of the time Thursday night, Satriani 
chose right. 
</P>
<P>
He also varied the mood with some toned-down, tension-releasing pieces and some 
that featured his strained vocals. Few great guitarists have been better than 
average singers, and Satriani is no different. DENNIS HUNT

JUNIPERUS CHINENSIS "TORULOSA": HOLLYWOOD JUNIPER, EVERGREEN SHRUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shrub of many names -- Hollywood, twisted, kaizuka -- the "Torulosa" juniper 
reaches about 12 to 15 feet in height with a distinctive branching habit. One 
might even say a bizarre branching habit. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Torulosa is a dense cone of dark green, branches shoot out at 
weird angles. Some go up, some go out, some go around, and the effect is that 
of a plant trying to unwrap itself. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I noticed this juniper was at UCLA, where a pale beige wall was 
lined with about a dozen of them. When the sun hit at an angle, the branches 
and their shadows looked like a multilimbed Indian goddess. The effect was 
quite beautiful and exotic. 
</P>
<P>
But put one of these in the middle of a lawn, all by itself, and you have a 
forlorn, unsettling sight. Maybe it just needs something nearby to reach for, 
but Torulosa looks tortured when it is alone and merely tortuous when in a 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Junipers are the most popular evergreens in Southern California, probably 
because there's a shape and size for almost every need: everything from ground 
covers to giant trees. 
</P>
<P>
Junipers adapt to almost any soil, unless it is waterlogged, and grow happily 
in full sun (except in the desert) or light shade. Once established, they are 
drought-tolerant, so don't plant them where they will be watered often. 
</P>
<P>
Junipers also attract a dismaying range of pests, including spider mites, 
aphids and borers. 
</P>
<P>
The mites announce themselves with fine webs among the branches. If there is 
any doubt, tap a branch while holding a piece of white paper under it; when 
tiny spiders (very tiny) fall onto the paper, you've got trouble. Mites can 
often be held in check by blasts of water. This can also work for aphids, but 
it requires vigilance. Neglect the junipers for a few days, and a whole new 
generation of aphids moves in. 
</P>
<P>
But junipers are handsome plants, they don't always attract insects, and the 
Torulosa is uniquely suited to light stucco walls. Just be sure to give it 
plenty of neighbors. JUDITH SIMS

YOUR STAMPS: HAND-DRAWN CACHETS REFLECT CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause is a free-lance writer and a member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have seen Civil War patriotic covers (envelopes) with embossed 
designs and some with hand-drawn designs. Would a cover from 1863 with a 
hand-drawn flag on the reverse be considered a Civil War patriotic? My cover 
has a 1-cent Franklin, 2-cent Jackson and 3-cent Washington stamp, and a 
hand-drawn flag on the reverse. -- J.N. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, this is a Civil War patriotic cover, worth maybe $20 or $30 (or 
more), depending on the condition and postmarks. It sounds like a double-weight 
letter, costing 6 cents postage, that is 3 cents per half ounce, the 
first-class rate in 1863. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to like hand-drawn cachets (cover designs) because they tend to be 
"one-of-a-kind" and show some thought and creativity on the part of the sender 
of long ago. Hand-drawn designs are not necessarily more valuable than printed 
designs, and the overall condition of the stamps affixed and the cover's 
appearance are the major factors that determine its market price. Civil War 
mail isn't rare, but handsome covers in nicely preserved condition always have 
a market. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think it is worthwhile to save a booklet of the recently released 
Self-Adhesive Extraordinary stamps? -- G.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: You're asking me to predict the future, something that is always hard to do 
in stamp collecting. By "worthwhile" I assume that you mean whether or not 
these stamps will be a good long-term investment, paying at least the 
equivalent of bank interest for, say, 5 or 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on how many of these booklets are sold, how many are then used 
up for postage and how many are left in pristine mint condition for future 
collectors, who may or may not generate demand sufficient to make the market 
price of these things rise over the years. None of these factors are known at 
present, which is why stamp collecting is so exciting and interesting, even for 
stamp booklets, which non-collectors might consider just routine postal issues 
good only for use on daily mail. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can always use the stamps for postage at any time, as they will 
never be worth less than face value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I enclose a copy of my letter addressed to the Postmaster General concerning 
a problem some of your readers may have encountered -- receiving mail from 
overseas with the stamp missing. These are usually commemoratives or high-value 
issues. It is something that I experience quite regularly these days, and for a 
stamp collector it is most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Surely foreign mail must have the correct postage to enter this country, so I 
must conclude the stamp theft takes place in the U.S. Postal Service. I urge 
anyone else who has experienced this problem to write to the Postmaster General 
at the U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza S.W., Washington, D.C. 20260. -- 
G.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: You can understand, of course, that somebody might take an unused stamp off 
an envelope with the intention of reusing it. But when canceled stamps, 
especially of the kind that a collector might enjoy, are ripped off mail, then 
we can only speculate how desperate some postal employee must be to add nice 
canceled stamps to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
The Postmaster General and his staff would be pleased to hear any compliments 
or legitimate complaints that mail-users have, although in this case it might 
be appropriate also to notify your local post office about this problem in the 
hope that they can do something to correct it if the stamp swipings are taking 
place locally. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With all the recent turmoil in China, are their stamps illegal or hard to 
obtain? -- T.E. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Stamps from the People's Republic of China are freely imported and 
bought and sold in the United States. Many local dealers will be happy to show 
you a selection. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is going to happen with the stamp market in view of the changes in 
prices in the Scott catalogues? -- R.Q. 
</P>
<P>
A: Until 1988, Scott stamp catalogues traditionally overpriced most stamps, it 
being understood by collectors and dealers alike that the real values were 
below catalogue values. With the 1989 and 1990 catalogue editions, Scott has 
announced a change in pricing policy. Now catalogues indicate net retail prices 
-- in other words, the price at which you may find a stamp for sale at a stamp 
shop. A lot of philatelists dislike the new pricing scheme, but everybody knows 
that the real values of stamps are only indirectly affected by catalogues.

JUSTICES UPHOLD DENIAL OF CUSTODY OVER DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court, acting in a precedent-setting case, has cleared 
the way for authorities to deny a mother custody of a child born suffering the 
effects of illegal drugs she took during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Over two dissenting votes, the justices refused to disturb a ruling last 
November by a state Court of Appeal in San Diego that for the first time denied 
custody solely because of a mother's drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action, taken in a brief order released Thursday, allows the 
appellate decision to become binding on trial courts throughout California. 
Only Justices Allen E. Broussard and Marcus M. Kaufman voted to grant a hearing 
of the mother's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The justices declined to hear claims by the attorney for a Vista woman in the 
case that drug use -- without other evidence of child abuse -- was insufficient 
grounds to deny custody. The ruling was so broad, the lawyer warned, that 
officials theoretically could remove custody because of harm to a child from 
the mother's smoking of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, James G. Dunn of San Diego, said Friday the ruling represented an 
invasion of the constitutional right to privacy and that an appeal to the U.S. 
Supreme Court was probable. "We believe the state is improperly interfering 
with a mother's prenatal conduct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern also was expressed by Pamela A. Mohr, directing attorney for the 
Childrens Rights Project in Los Angeles, one of several legal and medical 
groups that had urged the high court to overturn the appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Mohr said the decision will have a "tremendous impact" in Los Angeles, perhaps 
doubling the 2,500 cases involving drug-affected babies that come into court 
annually. The risk of losing custody solely because of drug use, she added, 
would discourage pregnant women from obtaining prenatal and hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disturbed by this ruling," Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward J. Mantyla agreed that it is likely there 
will be increased attempts by authorities to deny custody to mothers whose 
children are affected by drug-use. But he cautioned that such action by 
juvenile courts was far from automatic. Also, he noted, there are alternatives 
such as permitting a father to retain custody. 
</P>
<P>
Mantyla praised the appellate ruling as "a correct and well-reasoned" one. 
"This is something that has been badly needed to clarify a gray area of the law 
but one that is exploding." 
</P>
<P>
The high court's refusal to set aside the decision came as public concern has 
grown over narcotics use by mothers-to-be. The appeals court noted that 
according to a recent government study, an estimated 11% of the children born 
in U.S. hospitals have been exposed to dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation introduced at the state capitol would provide added treatment 
programs for maternal drug-abuse and in some instances allow manslaughter 
charges to be brought against mothers whose children die after birth from drug 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved a woman identified only as Kelly D., who gave premature birth 
to a son, Troy D., in February 1988 at an Oceanside hospital. Both the mother 
and son tested positive for amphetamines and opiates, with the boy suffering 
from weight loss, lethargy and other signs of drug withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital reported the results to child-protective authorities, and later a 
juvenile court took custody from the parents and placed the boy with his 
grandparents. The parents were permitted visits only with the consent of a 
social worker and were ordered to submit to psychological evaluations and to 
undergo drug rehabilitation, including drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
The mother challenged the action in court. But on Nov. 15, the state Court of 
Appeal upheld the removal of the child, saying officials had acted properly to 
protect the boy from abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"The severe problem of babies born under the influence of dangerous drugs due 
to their mothers' use of such drugs during pregnancy has reached great 
proportions," Appellate Justice Charles W. Froehlich, Jr., wrote for the panel. 
" . . . We agree that prenatal use of dangerous drugs by a mother is (evidence) 
of future child neglect." 
</P>
<P>
The court acknowledged that the fetus does not enjoy the same legal status as a 
child after birth. But nonetheless, it said, a living child "must be afforded 
the protection of the juvenile court even though he is at risk because of his 
mother's actions before his birth." 
</P>
<P>
The panel also turned down the mother's claims that disclosure of the drug 
tests violated a state law protecting the privacy of medical records and the 
legal privilege of confidentiality between a physician and a patient. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's use of dangerous drugs during pregnancy brought harm to her son, 
and the hospital staff properly reported their suspicion of child-abuse as 
required by state penal code provisions, the court said.

DISTRICT-ONLY CHANGE FAILS TO CUT S.D. ELECTION COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dashing expectations that district-only races would reduce campaign costs, 
nearly $2 million was spent in last fall's four San Diego City Council 
elections, including a record of nearly $430,000 spent by defeated incumbent Ed 
Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the $790,000-plus price tag in the 1st District contest in which Abbe 
Wolfsheimer narrowly won reelection, campaign expense reports filed this week 
with the city clerk's office disproved district election proponents' oft-stated 
contention that reducing the scale of local races would likely produce a drop 
in election costs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the amounts spent in this year's district-only council races were 
comparable to those spent in the city's former two-tiered council elections, in 
which district primaries were followed by citywide runoffs between the top two 
vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, last fall's four district-only races' cost $1,963,554 -- only slightly 
less than the record $2.2 million spent in the 1987 council campaign. 
Struiksma's losing $429,726 campaign set a single-candidate record, eclipsing 
the $404,846 spent by Councilman Bob Filner in 1987, and Wolfsheimer 
established another mark by spending $250,000 of her own money in her 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
To put those dollar figures in perspective, there were two notable differences 
between the past two council elections: Finalists in the 1987 races ran 
citywide, where costs are proportionally higher than within a single district, 
and they were competing for four open seats, a political rarity that drew 29 
candidates. In contrast, incumbents sought reelection in each of last year's 
council races, reducing the field to 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the 1989 council races saw fewer candidates spend nearly as much in 
district-only races as had been spent citywide two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disappointment to see that much money spent, but it shows how far the 
development industry and others will go to try to control the council," said 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who defeated Struiksma in the 5th District race 
despite being outspent by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. "But I think it backfired. 
When you spend that much in just a district, it's overkill." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, three of the four candidates who spent more than $250,000 last fall -- 
Struiksma, then-3rd District incumbent Gloria McColl and Wolfsheimer challenger 
Bob Trettin -- lost their respective races. The only exception was Wolfsheimer, 
who spent $349,372 -- nearly three-fourths of it her own money -- in winning a 
second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson that future council candidates should derive from 1989's experience, 
Bernhardt argues, is that "money alone can no longer buy council elections -- 
and trying to do so can be counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
Disputing that theory, political consultant Jim Johnston, whose firm managed 
Struiksma's unsuccessful campaign, attributes Struiksma's and McColl's losses 
more to a strong anti-incumbent sentiment among voters than to a backlash 
against their heavy spending. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any sense that we had reached a saturation point -- we could 
have and would have spent even more if we had had it," Johnston said. "I never 
subscribed to that argument that district elections would give us cheaper 
elections. Just reducing the size of the playing field doesn't necessarily mean 
you're going to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
District election advocates, however, had predicted that lower campaign costs 
would be one of the major -- and desirable -- byproducts of San Diego voters' 
1988 approval of Proposition E, the citizens' initiative that established 
district-only races. 
</P>
<P>
With races confined to single districts only one-eighth the size of the 
citywide electorate, the argument went, candidates would not need to rely upon 
the costly television and radio advertisements needed to compete effectively 
citywide. Moreover, the district elections' smaller scale was expected to 
reduce expenses ranging from mailers -- which would be sent to fewer voters -- 
to telephone and postage costs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the theory," Bernhardt said, chuckling wryly. "But I guess the 
election showed that it's possible to spend as much or more money in a district 
as citywide. Whether it works is another matter." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt herself, in fact, spent roughly 50% more than she had pledged to 
under a self-imposed $1-per-voter guideline -- a standard that produced a 
ceiling of about $150,000 for the primary and general election combined. Her 
total, however, reached $228,823, including $54,700 of her own money -- funds 
that Bernhardt argued were needed to help her keep pace with Struiksma's 
$429,726 race. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the money spent by three unsuccessful primary candidates, the 5th 
District race's overall price tag was just under $700,000. In the September 
primary, former Councilman Floyd Morrow spent $31,736, lawyer Mike Eckmann 
spent $2,536 and marketing official Bob Switzer spent less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive council contest was in the 1st District, where former City 
Hall and county supervisorial aide Bob Trettin narrowly outspent Wolfsheimer, 
$360,999 to $349,372, in a race that cost more than $790,000 overall. However, 
with Wolfsheimer's $250,000 loan repeating her 1985 pattern of largely 
underwriting her own campaign -- four years ago, she spent $229,000 of her own 
money -- there was a much wider gap between the two candidates' contribution 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Trettin -- who, like Struiksma, drew a large portion of his donations 
from development interests -- actually outraised the incumbent by a more than 
3-1 margin, an impressive performance for a challenger. Trettin also spent 
$35,706 of his own money, while defeated primary candidate Harry Mathis spent 
$81,423 in his effort. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the two other council contests was considerably lower, largely 
because both were decided in the September primary by the victors' receipt of 
more than 50% of the vote, the margin needed to avoid a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
In his 3rd District race against McColl, John Hartley -- who spearheaded the 
push for district elections -- spent the least of the four council victors, 
spending only $90,981, contrasted with McColl's $254,293 total. 
</P>
<P>
"My election proved that it doesn't take as much money to run and win as it 
used to," Hartley said. "That doesn't mean that candidates with lots of money 
won't continue to spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley seconded Bernhardt's suggestion that large campaign expenditures can be 
damaging to the candidates who make them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only so many mailers you can send out," Hartley said. "After a while, 
you begin to offend people." 
</P>
<P>
In the 7th District campaign, Councilwoman Judy McCarty spent $125,351 in her 
victory over former firefighter Kenneth Key, a long shot who spent only $1,489 
in his campaign.

A state prison inmate pleaded innocent in Phoenix to a renewed murder charge in 
the 1976 car-bomb slaying of an investigative reporter for the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
James Robison, 67, of Chandler, Ariz., was convicted in 1977 of killing Don 
Bolles, but the conviction was reversed on appeal. Robison remained in prison 
on an unrelated conviction. There are indications that Phoenix attorney Neal 
Roberts is a potential target of a state grand jury investigating a possible 
conspiracy to obstruct earlier investigations of the Bolles case.

Lawyers for an AIDS-afflicted doctor suing New York City for negligence 
asserted that they had proved a city hospital was careless in disposing of 
infectious wastes. Dr. Veronica Prego claims that she contracted the disease 
from a needle left carelessly at Kings County Hospital. A professor at the 
Columbia University Graduate School of Business testified that Prego could have 
made up to $30 million in her normal estimated working lifetime of 32.8 years 
had she not become infected.

A jury of seven women and five men was selected in the trial of Joseph 
Hazelwood, who was the skipper aboard the Exxon Valdez when it hit a reef and 
caused the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers settled on the panel of 12 by midday, but questioning continued to seat 
three alternates in the case. The jury was to be officially impaneled Monday 
and opening statements will follow. Prosecution and defense lawyers quizzed 52 
prospective jurors before settling on the 12 citizens who will spend the next 
several weeks hearing testimony and considering evidence.

Authorities said the FBI has been informed by Colombian officials that Antonio 
Zuluaga, a survivor of the Avianca Flight 52 crash who was charged with 
smuggling cocaine concealed in his intestinal tract, may also be a hit man for 
the Medellin drug cartel. Zuluaga, 46, was arraigned on felony drug possession 
charges and ordered held without bail at a hearing in the Nassau County Medical 
Center's prison ward, where he remained in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source close to the crash investigation told the Associated Press 
that cockpit tapes reveal that the pilot of the fuel-starved plane asked the 
co-pilot if he had told air traffic controllers they had an "emergency." The 
co-pilot did not directly answer the question, saying: "I told them we're low 
on fuel," the source said.

DIET: WHAT WE EAT PROVIDES A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST MANY CANCERS. FEAR 
NOT THE'KILLER BROCCOLI.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEVRA LEE DAVIS, Devra Lee Davis is a scholar-in-residence at the National 
Academy of Sciences in Washington. A longer version of this article appears in 
the current issue of Health &amp; Environment Digest. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes" may sound like the name of a cult, but 
it's really a specter haunting our supermarkets today. Deadly cabbage? 
Poisonous broccoli? 
</P>
<P>
Poppycock! Sure, some naturally occurring compounds extracted from cabbage and 
broccoli cause cancer in test animals. But people do not eat these extracts 
alone. Rather, we eat whole foods that contain lots of good things that fight 
cancer -- anti-carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
No one would dispute the fact that what our species has ingested is what we 
beget. We have been eating as long as we have been evolving. Lactose tolerance 
is greatest in people living in regions that have consumed dairy products for 
the longest time. Several million years of evolution from our omnivorous 
hominid ancestors may well have conferred upon us some resistance to 
longstanding, naturally occurring carcinogens, such as those studied in 
broccoli. We have no such genetic experience with new synthetic organic 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
What people eat provides a first line of defense against many cancers. 
Beta-carotene, the stuff that makes carrots orange and is the precursor for 
vitamin A, protects against lung cancer, caused mostly by smoking. Recent 
studies have found that smokers have lower levels of beta-carotene in their 
blood, even if their consumption is the same as a nonsmoker's, suggesting that 
smoking itself may reduce blood carotene. 
</P>
<P>
Orangeness is not the only trait of food that may protect against cancer, 
according to several recent studies. People of China's Shanxi Province who 
routinely eat garlic and onions have much lower rates of stomach cancer. In 
Hawaii, those whose diets include lots of vegetables have significantly lower 
rates of lung cancer, while in Japan green-tea drinkers have lowerstomach 
cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
Studies with some naturally occurring compounds demonstrate the wisdom of 
eating your fruits and vegetables. Far from being a harbinger of destruction, 
broccoli contains lots of good materials, including anti-oxidant vitamins, 
fiber and a compound called phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC). It prevents the 
most toxic material ever found in tobacco smoke from attacking DNA, and can 
snuff out or reverse the growth of tumors in animals. Ellagic acid, found in 
many fruits, such as strawberries, also inhibits cancer growth by blocking 
nasty compounds within cells. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous foods and condiments inhibit the growth of tumors in animals and are 
linked with lower risks for some human cancers. Parsley, sage, rosemary and 
thyme not only made a great song, but they prevent some toxic molds from 
growing. Mice on a diet deficient in vitamin E contracted more colon tumors 
when exposed to a cancer-causing compound than did those on a diet high in this 
vitamin. Garlic and onions, turmeric (a common spice in Indian cooking), 
capsaicin (extracted from hot peppers), cumin, clove, caraway and seafood all 
contain substances shown to reduce the effect of cancer-causing agents and 
provide a number of other health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The long list of good things in vegetables and fruit may well explain why 
vegetarians have lower overall rates of cancer. As populations change their 
eating habits to include more foods that contain anti-carcinogens, their 
patterns of cancer may change. In the United States, Britain, West Germany and 
most of the other industrialized countries, stomach cancer rates are dropping 
rapidly. This decline may reflect improved handling and preservation of food, 
reduced use of salts and year-round consumption of green and yellow vegetables 
and fruits that contain potent anti-carcinogenic compounds and fiber. 
</P>
<P>
In many industrial countries, this continuing decline in stomach cancer is 
accompanied by increases in a number of cancers not associated with cigarette 
smoking, including bone and brain cancer. From 1950 to 1986, according to the 
National Cancer Institute, new cancer cases (minus lung cancer and adjusted for 
aging of the population) rose by 27%. New cases of childhood cancer rose more 
than 20% during this same time, despite impressive improvements in treatment 
for this disease. The causes of these troubling trends are not likely to rest 
with killer broccoli and its ilk, or with major changes in our food patterns or 
changes in methods of diagnosis. Cancers that have continued to increase over 
the past two decades are likely to reflect changes in our modern life that have 
not been adequately studied or identified.

MALIBU DESERVES ITS OWN DESTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few would shed tears over the woes of Malibu. This is hardly an underprivileged 
area. But Malibu folk have a legitimate beef with the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors over the board's reluctance to allow them to vote on whether to 
incorporate their coastal enclave as a city. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Area Formation Commission last May approved the petition of Malibu 
voters to decide on cityhood. The way most people read state law, the county 
supervisors then had 60 days in which to schedule the election. But the 
supervisors voted 4-1 last November to postpone the decision indefinitely. Now 
a Superior Court judge has ruled that the supervisors acted improperly and 
should set the election for June 5. They should do so with dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
The hang-up is over Malibu sewage. There is no general sewage system in Malibu. 
Homes are served by septic tanks, a lamentable state of affairs in the 1990s. 
The area must have a modern sewage collection and treatment system. But the 
supervisors are insisting that Malibu have a system that would permit explosive 
new growth -- precisely what the Malibu incorporators want to avoid. A 
condition of the incorporation is that the county retain jurisdiction over the 
sewage issue for 10 years. Still, the supervisors are afraid that Malibu will 
somehow manage to build a smaller system if the community wins cityhood. That, 
frankly, should be Malibu's option, as long as the system can handle present 
demand and allow for a reasonable amount of growth. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a case in which only the county board stands between Malibu and a 
massive public health crisis. If there were a health threat even now, the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board could take command of the situation. And 
the state Coastal Commission is the proper body to determine what sort of 
growth is appropriate within Malibu's coastal zone. The supervisors should 
allow Malibu to determine its own destiny.

TRUE GRAFT IN THE STATEHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corruption has been hanging over California's capitol for years. Now it's 
official: true graft in the Statehouse. State Sen. Joseph Montoya stands 
convicted on five federal criminal counts of extortion, one of racketeering and 
one of money laundering. And Montoya's is not necessarily an isolated case. 
More prosecutions could follow from the elaborate FBI sting operation that has 
been under way for several years. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much that could make the Legislature's reputation among voters 
worse than it is. But the conviction of the Whittier Democrat is certain to 
further deepen the public distrust of lawmakers. And sadly, such feelings spill 
over onto the reputations of the many legislators who work hard in the public's 
behalf and seek no special rewards for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders must now move with alacrity to enact the toughest possible 
ethics law, which will implement a reform measure already on the June election 
ballot. There must be no loopholes that opponents can use to raise further 
suspicion in the minds of voters that somehow lawmakers will find a way to reap 
unearned personal benefits from their public service. Then, the Legislature 
should set to work on a campaign-finance law that will end all possibility of 
the sort of contribution shakedown that was outlined by the evidence in the 
Montoya trial. 
</P>
<P>
As for Montoya himself, the Senate leadership should at least strip him of his 
committee chairmanship immediately. Then, should Montoya refuse to resign, the 
leaders should initiate action at the appropriate time to expel him from the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, Sacramento has behaved as if this whole nasty mess would just go 
away and legislators could get back to business as usual. The shock of the 
conviction should convince them that the voters will stand for no less -- and 
deserve no less -- than a thorough housecleaning.

SEEING THE LIGHT IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The path has been cleared for negotiating the way to a democratic South Africa. 
This is the brilliant contribution of President Frederik W. de Klerk, who has 
created a historic opportunity for all the people of that troubled nation. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to the opening session of Parliament on Friday, De Klerk swept 
away some of the most troubling obstacles to negotiations. He promised the 
unconditional release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the 71-year-old leader of 
the African National Congress, and lifted bans on the ANC and the other 
anti-apartheid organizations. He lifted some, but not all, press restrictions. 
He suspended hangings. He agreed to release all political prisoners. And he has 
made clear his determination to have Parliament end the onerous Separate 
Amenities Act that has separated the races in public places. 
</P>
<P>
There still remain many other obstacles. Some are written in law, including the 
Group Areas Act that limits the property rights of the black majority. Some are 
embedded in practice, like the harsh police actions that were evident even on 
Friday as guard dogs were turned on crowds marching to protest apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
But De Klerk has moved faster than most expected, responded more effectively 
than his opponents could have hoped for, and has thereby created a promising 
climate for the negotiations that must follow. This has, appropriately, won 
praise from many quarters, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town, the 
Anglican primate who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of nonviolent 
opposition to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has also expressed approval for what De Klerk said, and has 
called for a re-examination of American policy towards South Africa. 
Re-examination is always appropriate, but any abandonment or modification of 
sanctions would be premature. The sanctions have played an important, perhaps 
decisive, role in accelerating change in South Africa. Their modification 
should be triggered by performance, not just promises. The U.S. State 
Department has made clear that much will depend on what is accomplished at this 
new session of Parliament. That, too, is appropriate. De Klerk has created the 
climate for great accomplishments. It is now for the members of Parliament to 
get on with implementation. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, obviously, is not just to the members of Parliament, who were 
elected by only a small minority of the people. The black majority must also 
now respond constructively, setting aside the violence and obstruction of their 
opposition to test the sincerity of the negotiations. And in the weeks ahead, 
there will be a particular responsibility for security forces to respond 
effectively to the threats of violence emanating from those whites on the right 
who want to maintain and reinforce apartheid at all cost. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of confidence among the diverse peoples of South Africa will not 
be easy. But De Klerk has done more than any other leader to set in motion the 
workings for a negotiated rather than a violent solution. Most South Africans 
will surely share the hope implicit in his declaration that "the season of 
violence is over." The days ahead will measure the substance of his affirmation 
that "the time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived."

PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICY ON CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If I hear one more person (politician, journalist, commentator) say we should 
trust President George Bush's instincts on China because he lived there for a 
couple of years back in the 1970s, I am going to scream. What arrogance! What 
ignorance! I was born a Chinese, brought up in a traditional Chinese family, 
knowledgeable in its history and culture, and I don't claim to understand its 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
After all, what acceptable explanation can there be for a government to order 
the wholesale massacre of its own people? 
</P>
<P>
I have lived in America for 17 years, and I certainly don't claim to understand 
its leaders. I hear endless rhetoric on freedom and democracy, then see the 
President use all the power and prestige of his office to crush the spirit of 
Chinese students who are risking their lives for those same principles. I see 
the President sacrifice American and Panamanian lives to capture Manuel 
Noriega, but send National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to toast the 
butchers of Beijing. In classic "Alice in Wonderland" logic, Bush maintains 
that the 1 billion Chinese are so important that he would not risk isolating 
them, but apparently the lives of thousands of Chinese students slaughtered at 
Tian An Men Square are worth so little to him that he's willing to let the 
Chinese leaders get away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot of talk on what messages are sent by the Senate sustaining the 
President's veto. I don't know how the old men in China interpret it, but to 
me, it's loud and clear: Next time George Bush and those Republican senators 
who betrayed the students lecture someone on democracy and human rights, I will 
just tell them, "Oh, just shut up, it's all politics to you!"

Luedtke's column was right on target. However, her arguments "for greater 
tolerance, the fundamental beliefs of love and brotherhood" should include the 
Missouri Synod Lutheran Church's position on women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
After a lifetime of hearing sermons on the "inclusive" nature of Christianity 
in the Lutheran Church, I'm still waiting for the power structure to actually 
practice it. I'd like to rephrase Luedtke's question: And how long will it take 
for the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church to accept practicing homosexuals and 
women among its clergy?

If someone tried to force a fundamentalist minister on a homosexual 
congregation, Luedtke would scream to high heaven. Yet she feels she has the 
right to try to force on other congregations ministers just as unwanted and 
just as unsuitable to them. 
</P>
<P>
If someone said homosexuals -- and others -- had no right to their own 
interpretation of the Bible, she would also be just as outraged. Yet she 
objects when Lutherans make their choice to accept the Bible just as written, 
in regard to classifying homosexuality as a serious wrong, and therefore 
sinful. Besides their freedom of choice, there is, in fact, strong reason for 
accepting this teaching, since former homosexuals have stated that, based on 
that outlook they have been able to change "through Christ" ("The Gospel and 
the Gay," by K.O. Gangel). 
</P>
<P>
Lutherans, then -- as well as other Christians -- have every right to their own 
beliefs -- and, therefore, the right to refuse as leaders, those who do not 
share their beliefs. This fundamental right to choice of leader is what both 
Protestantism and democracy are all about. So-called "liberalism," it would 
seem, can also attempt dictatorship.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICY ON CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't know about you, but I was outraged when Bush called the country's 
indignation over his veto of the bill that will allow Chinese students to 
remain in this country after their visas expire "overly emotional." Considering 
the fact that his brother is employed at the New York firm which is selling 
millions of dollars in communications satellites to the totalitarian 
authorities there, one wonders if the President considers greed to be a better 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
After the slaughter in Tian An Men Square, Mr. "Kinder Gentler" Bush pledged to 
stand behind the people who stood in front of the tanks. Obviously, he forgot 
to tell them that behind his own back he carries a gun; and that it's the same 
one the Chinese authorities have used to kill the other students who dared 
speak up for their freedom.

CONTROVERSY OVER CUTTING AID TO ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilson's article contains numerous statements which require rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote, "The PLO opposes free elections because it does not want to surrender 
its power and influence to elected representatives." This is simply untrue. The 
PLO does support free and democratic elections which would be held under either 
United Nations or Palestinian auspices and not Israeli government auspices as 
proposed by the Shamir government. 
</P>
<P>
Also, one may legitimately ask just how democratic elections can be when 
candidates will be deported if they declare support for the PLO? (Shamir's 
policy.) If Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced that he would deport 
(to Miami) anyone who supported the Contras, then how many people would 
consider those elections democratic? 
</P>
<P>
Wilson wrote, "Egypt's acceptance in principle of the Baker plan reinforces 
Israel's position that negotiations must be limited to the authentic civilian 
leadership of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which further isolates the 
terrorist elements of the PLO from the search for a diplomatic resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the senator is unaware of the situation, but Egypt is negotiating on 
behalf of the PLO. Egyptian agreement does not "in principle" reinforce Israeli

DEVELOPMENT: THE OWNER GETS ZONING APPROVAL FOR AN UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE AT A 
NEW MOTEL IN ENCINO. RESIDENTS SAY THEY WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE ABOVEGROUND. 
</P>

<P>
A group of Encino homeowners were overjoyed last year when they learned of 
plans to tear down a deteriorating Ventura Boulevard motel and replace it with 
a new building. 
</P>
<P>
But that relief has turned to bitterness, not over what the owner plans to 
build on the ground, but what he plans to put below it. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Encino Property Owners Assn. said Friday that they were incensed 
by a city of Los Angeles zoning administrator's approval of an underground 
parking lot for the new motel at 17448 Ventura Blvd. They said the owner of the 
Encino Inn, King Chai, who lives in Santa Monica, had told them he planned to 
build a surface parking lot, not an underground structure. 
</P>
<P>
Chai said that he had always intended to build an underground lot and that his 
plans and diagrams had clearly outlined the structure. But a Los Angeles City 
Office of Zoning Administration notice on the project that was sent to 
homeowners last August did not indicate that Chai wanted to build a 
subterranean lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office is investigating whether the zoning 
administrator's approval of the lot should be withdrawn because proper notice 
was not given to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Encino Property Owners Assn. President Rob Glushon said an underground lot 
would allow Chai to seek city approval to increase the size of his motel to a 
density that might be incompatible with the adjacent neighborhood of 
single-family homes. He said it also would set a bad precedent, noting that no 
underground parking lots exist south of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that someone has tried to pull a fast one," Glushon said. "We were 
never notified about this. If we had known this is what they planned to do, we 
would have opposed it." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lewis, a resident who lives near the motel, said, "I'm absolutely 
outraged. Someone has deliberately attempted to confuse us and misstated what 
he planned to do there." 
</P>
<P>
Chai said he had always planned for underground parking. "Why do these 
homeowners object to so much?" he said. "It's an old junk building, and we just 
want to make it nicer. This is not a communist country. Commercial property 
owners have rights here." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners said that they are demanding a new hearing on the project and that 
they will file a lawsuit if it is not granted. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Office of Zoning Administration sent a notice to homeowners who 
live near the Encino Inn in July, 1989, asking for opinions about the 
three-story, 60-unit motel that would replace the 28-room motel now on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The notice said Chai also wanted to build a 62-space "surface" parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Chai discussed plans for the underground parking lot and showed 
diagrams, said Cindy Miscikowski, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude, who represents the area where the motel is located. 
</P>
<P>
But Glushon said members of the group did not attend the hearing because they 
were not opposed to the project, since the notice indicated that parking would 
be aboveground. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Zoning Administrator William E. Lillenberg two months later approved 
a conditional-use permit for a two-level underground lot as well as a surface 
lot, with a total of 62 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Glushon said the group was prepared to appeal the project to the Los Angeles 
City Council.

FOLLOW-HOME THIEF GETS 38 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ROBBING 9 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man convicted of robbing nine middle-aged and elderly women of 
expensive jewelry after following them home from supermarkets was sentenced 
Friday to 38 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this sends a message, sir, that you can't pick on senior citizens," San 
Fernando Superior Court Judge Malcolm H. Mackey told Claude Davis Jr., 38, 
after announcing the sentence. Davis was also convicted of attempting to rob a 
10th woman. 
</P>
<P>
Davis usually approached his victims on foot in the driveways or garages of 
their homes and asked them for directions. As they tried to help, he punched 
them, usually knocking them to the ground, then pulled off their rings. In some 
cases, Davis continued hitting the women even after he had their jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The "follow-home jewelry bandit" created panic in affluent Sherman Oaks and 
Encino neighborhoods, and soon others were imitating the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing hearing, Louise G. Drake, 77, who was looking at a map 
book to try to help Davis when he knocked her unconscious, said the attack left 
her with permanent emotional scars. She asked that he receive the maximum 
possible prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"I am terrified of leaving my house, driving my car and going shopping," Drake 
said, reading a prepared statement. "I have become virtually a prisoner in my 
own home." 
</P>
<P>
She said many other senior citizens also feel vulnerable to unprovoked attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I speak not only for myself but also for all the senior citizens of America 
who, instead of being free to enjoy their retirement years, live in constant 
fear, actual terror," she said. "We are not safe on the streets, on the 
freeways and now, in and around our houses." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims of Davis' attacks, who ranged in age from 55 to 81, 
suffered permanent damage, including a violinist who lost the use of a finger, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Ramseyer. The jewelry pieces taken from the women 
were valued between $10,000 and $30,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was arrested on Jan. 11, 1989, after a special police team saw him 
loitering in the parking lots of the two supermarkets from which all the 
victims had been followed. All of the victims later identified Davis as their 
assailant.

MONKS AT THAI BUDDHIST TEMPLE 'BEG' FOR BREAKFAST, SOLVE PARKING PROBLEMS AND 
LEARN TO ADAPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Every Saturday at dawn, Buddhist monks clad in saffron robes and carrying alms 
bowls leave their North Hollywood temple to "beg" for food from nearby suburban 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Their heads and eyebrows shaved, the ascetic monks form an unusual tableau as 
they stroll past comfortable ranch homes and shiny cars, stopping to accept 
such offerings as fried bananas, steamed rice and canned fish from the 
increasing number of Thais who live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of those residents, Tawee Tiengerd, 50, placed Oriental pears in one monk's 
bowl last Saturday, dropped to his knees near his white Nissan Sentra, clasped 
his hands and bowed reverentially. "Through good works like these, we have a 
chance to escape the trap of reincarnation and go to Nirvana," Tiengerd said. 
</P>
<P>
Performed daily in Thailand for hundreds of years, the alms-giving ritual has 
been practiced in North Hollywood on Saturdays for the past two years by monks 
from the Wat-Thai Temple on Cantara Street. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old temple, whose gold-crested pagoda is the largest in the United 
States, serves as a community center for many of the 200,000 Thai people in 
Southern California. And for those living near the temple, the alms-giving 
ritual is of special importance. 
</P>
<P>
But the popularity of the temple has meant congestion and parking problems that 
began shortly after it was built in 1972. In years past, neighbors complained 
until temple leaders took the unusual step of using donations to buy the five 
nearest houses on Van Noord Avenue, a cul-de-sac on the temple's east border, 
said Sam Wongskhaluang, president of the Thai Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to pull in our driveways and lock up and leave their cars," said 
Marion Wygand, 65, who lives a few blocks from the temple and once helped 
organize residents upset about traffic and parking. "But things have gotten 
better since they bought all that land in the cul-de-sac." 
</P>
<P>
Wygand said the alms-giving ritual takes place so early in the morning that 
many residents are unaware it takes place. But it has special meaning for Thai 
Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of dhana, or charity, is one of the fundamental tenets of Buddhism, 
the religion of 95% of the Thai people, said Michael Moerman, an anthropology 
professor at UCLA who specializes in Southeast Asia. "By giving alms, the 
people earn tham bun, or religious merit," Moerman said. "The more merit you 
have, the better your fate is in this and future lives." 
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, monks rarely touch money or cook food. Thus, they rely solely on 
the generosity of the people for their daily sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, though, some customs had to change. Monks are still 
required to be celibate and must fast from noon until their morning meal. But 
the city's car culture and its far-flung Thai community forced the monks to 
fend for themselves when they first arrived in 1972. They shopped for their own 
food at the supermarket, learned to cook and even to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Parallel parking was very difficult, but we practiced so much that we can do 
it now," said Phramaharuam Sumetee, one of 17 monks in residence at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
The monks, using umbrellas in rainy weather, were able to revive the 
alms-giving tradition once a week in North Hollywood because about 50 Thai 
families have moved into the neighborhood near the temple. From two to five 
monks typically spend about an hour collecting the food, which all the monks 
share at their 7:30 a.m. meal. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a place to pray, Wat-Thai is the center of community life, which 
is why one nearby resident, Sriwong Ayasit Koziel, moved there with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother, she is 78, she likes to go to the temple every day," said Koziel, 
40, as she placed plastic containers of food in the monks' cast-iron alms 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some non-Thai residents complained that the temple caused 
congestion and parking problems in the neighborhood. The temple attracts as 
many as 10,000 people on Buddhist religious holidays, but has only 80 parking 
spaces. Responding to the complaints, the temple rented a large parking lot in 
Panorama City and hired a shuttle bus to transport people to services. 
Neighbors say that has greatly helped the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The temple has also purchased homes on adjacent streets to reduce complaints, 
Wongskhaluang said. In the past 10 years, the temple bought five of the six 
houses on nearby Van Noord Avenue and uses them to house monks and guests, 
including visiting generals, from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a Thai custom to preserve amicable relations and adapt -- to 
bend like the bamboo rather than have confrontations with people," said 
Moerman, the UCLA professor, referring to the temple's home purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The lone holdout on Van Noord Avenue -- Alisa Caraveo -- is asking $300,000 for 
her three-bedroom, two-bath home, Wongskhaluang said. He said the temple has 
offered to pay $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
There was no friction last Saturday when the monks sat down to eat their 
morning meal, including the fried bananas and other dishes donated by 
residents. Despite the long fast and the light meal, the monks were in strong 
voice at the end of the meal during their traditional prayer. 
</P>
<P>
The monks will eat once more before noon, said Vara Wongskhaluang, a temple 
volunteer and the wife of the president of the Thai association. Much as the 
monks enjoy their native cuisine, she said, they have also learned to relish 
American fast-food for that second morning meal. 
</P>
<P>
"Quarter-pounders are a big hit with them," she said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOO ASKS AGENCY TO SEIZE DEVELOPER'S BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo urged a city agency Friday to seize a 
developer's $250,000 bond because the developer failed to install traffic 
improvements to ease congestion in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Public Works took no action on Woo's request. 
</P>
<P>
The target of Woo's anger is the developer of the 25,000-square-foot Times 
Square mall at 12215 Ventura Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, a deputy of Woo, said the development team, led by Mitch 
Francis, was required to post a $250,000 bond with the city to guarantee that 
he would install a double left-turn lane at Ventura and Laurel Canyon 
boulevards and other improvements. But the work has not been done, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Getzoff, a partner in the Times Square project, complained that the 
development group has spent $50,000 on traffic studies but has been unable to 
get the city to decide what improvements are needed.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATAL CRASH CLOSES ANTELOPE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acar and a pickup truck collided on the Antelope Valley Freeway south of 
Palmdale Friday, killing one of the drivers, critically injuring the other and 
creating a massive traffic tie-up for northbound motorists, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the victims were not immediately available, nor were details 
of the cause of the crash, which occurred about 5:45 p.m. on the northbound 
side of the freeway a mile north of the Pearblossom Highway exit, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was sheared in half and its driver was thrown out, according to a 
motorist who saw the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck driver was being treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, 
Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Steven Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol closed all northbound lanes from about 6 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m. to clear the wreckage. Traffic backed up for several miles on the 
freeway and on Sierra Highway, the main alternate route.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROSECUTOR FREES 2 IN DRIVE-BY SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges have been dropped against two suspected gang members accused of 
killing a Pacoima man after he barred them from a birthday party in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ayala, 19, of Panorama City and Tanya Dowdy, 18, of Sun Valley were 
released from custody Thursday after prosecutors decided there is insufficient 
evidence to prove they aided and abetted the Jan. 13 drive-by shooting of 
Odilon Navarrete, 23, said Van Nuys Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Shellie Samuels. "We can prove only that they were passengers in the car," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A murder charge also was dropped against a third person, Karen Argott, 18, of 
Arleta, who drove the car, Samuels said. But prosecutors said the charges 
against Argott were dismissed for technical reasons and will be refiled. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant still is in effect for Walter Oswaldo Barillas, 22, of Canoga 
Park, who prosecutors say fired the shots. A 17-year-old girl who was in the 
car is scheduled to appear in Sylmar Juvenile Court on Feb. 28 to face murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty to 30 shots were fired toward Navarrete as he drove west on Oxnard 
Street near Van Nuys Boulevard, police said. A passenger in the car, 
Navarrete's girlfriend, Irma Ortega, 21, escaped injury when he pushed her to 
the floor of the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrete had earlier turned away the three female suspects when they tried to 
enter a private party at the Eagle Lodge on Haskell Avenue in Van Nuys, police 
said.

RETRIEVING UNWANTED CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our mission was a relatively simple one: retrieve discarded Christmas trees and 
bring them to nearby Balboa Park where the Los Angeles City Bureau of 
Sanitation was sponsoring a tree recycling program to turn used trees into 
compost and mulch. These trees would once again breathe life into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
What we didn't anticipate in undertaking this environmental task was the 
abundance of waste, the sheer number of trees simply thrown away with 
Thursday's garbage, not to mention the unknown number of trees gone unsold and 
dumped. So we worked like little elves in the night -- driving through dimly 
lit neighborhoods, immediately spotting any green "lump" and throwing it into 
our truck. 
</P>
<P>
Our merry band of "thieves" -- stealing from the ditch and giving to the earth 
-- quickly became known as "the Tree Patrol." Our motto: "A tree is a terrible 
thing to waste." Until next year . . .

RESTRICT DEVELOPMENT ON THE BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is to be commended for criticizing the delays in 
adopting restrictions on future development along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years homeowners and developers have worked with city 
planning staff to propose reasonable limits on density, additional parking and 
transportation requirements and measures to protect residential areas from 
commercial encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever justification for the delays, the fact is that Ventura Boulevard 
landowners and developers are quickly getting projects through the door so that 
they do not have to meet the new requirements. If city officials do not act 
now, the entire purpose and effectiveness of the proposed Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan will be undermined. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Boulevard cannot tolerate the additional thousands of vehicles 
generated by development pursuant to outdated code requirements. Some people 
say it's too late, but there is a possibility of another 40 million square feet 
of commercial development generating 150,000 more vehicles unless the new plan 
is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
We do not want any more delays, any more excuses or any more development 
without the requirements and protections of the Ventura Boulevard Specific 
Plan.

$200,000 FIRE BLAMED ON ELECTRICAL SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An electrical short started a fire that caused $200,000 damage at a Glendale 
business, fire officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 firefighters from Glendale, Burbank and Los Angeles fought the fire 
at Cal Best Ceiling, in the 1900 block of Gardena Avenue, which was reported at 
11:37 p.m. Thursday, said Mike Hand of the Verdugo dispatch center. 
</P>
<P>
Flames burned through the roof before they were extinguished early Friday, Hand 
said. The blaze caused $100,000 damage to the building and $100,000 to its 
contents, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. Hand said investigators determined the cause was an 
electrical malfunction.

2 CANDIDATES IN RUNNING FOR FOOTBALL JOB AT CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran has settled on two finalists for the vacant head football coaching 
position, according to university sources. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing this week, Dick Arbuckle, former offensive coordinator at 
Boise State, and Joe Harper, former coach at Northern Arizona, are the top 
candidates to replace fired Coach Bob Shoup, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I know those two are both up for the job, and I guess they are the two 
finalists," said junior defensive lineman Dana Zupke, a 1990 team captain. 
"It's common knowledge on campus that those two are up for the position, and 
they both visited the campus. . . . I've met both of the gentlemen, and I was 
impressed with both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Other university sources who confirmed the finalists declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Arbuckle and Harper both have experience as college head coaches. In addition 
to his stint at Northern Arizona, Harper coached 14 years at Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, where he won the NCAA Division II title in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He then went to Northern Arizona in 1982 and posted a 12-20 record in three 
seasons before being fired and moving into private business in Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a finalist for the Cal State Northridge coaching position in 1986, 
graduated in 1959 from UCLA, where he played offensive guard. He has been an 
assistant coach at Colorado, UCLA, Colorado State, UC Santa Barbara and 
Riverside City College and is currently living in Arcadia and selling 
commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Harper has had a winning record in 14 of his 17 seasons as a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Arbuckle compiled an 86-55-2 record in 15 years of high school coaching and has 
a college record of 22-17-2. He coached at the Oregon Institute of Technology 
in 1981 and 1982 and at Western Oregon State College in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Arbuckle played quarterback and safety at Oregon and graduated in 1961. He 
served as offensive line coach and recruiting coordinator at Oregon State and 
as offensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator for Boise State last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Cal Lutheran initiated a national search for the man who would 
become only the second football coach in school history. Shoup coached the 
Kingsmen for 28 years, but it became public in August that the 1989 season 
would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup contested the dismissal, but the university reiterated its decision in a 
Dec. 8 news release. Shoup filed a grievance with the Faculty Review Committee, 
but it was turned down Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup appealed the decision to the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents, 
but the executive committee upheld the faculty committee's earlier decision, 
thereby completing the faculty-grievance process. 
</P>
<P>
The five-person committee to select a coach will meet again Monday. Although 
Arbuckle and Harper are finalists, applications are still being accepted.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE SOFTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
LADY MATADORS TRYING TO GRADUATE ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are lean times for the Cal State Northridge softball program, a peek at 
the exterior of the Lady Matadors' third-base dugout being positive proof. 
</P>
<P>
There, painted in bold, white lettering and strung together in rows like 
pearls, were lists of CSUN's championships. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the ledger showed, Northridge had won eight consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships, seven regional titles and four NCAA 
Division II championships. 
</P>
<P>
But the slate has been wiped clean. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Torgeson, CSUN's coach, had the wall painted over in black. His reasoning: 
Lately, the Lady Matadors have been making empty boasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get back to the level we've been bragging about," said Torgeson, 
whose team had a record of 61-19 last season and failed to make the Final Four 
for the first time in eight seasons. "I used to think it gave us a mental edge 
when other teams came in and saw that, but we're just not playing up to that 
level anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, their Division II credits will not help in a year in which the Lady 
Matadors begin playing a Division I schedule. First, however, a grand exit is 
being plotted. 
</P>
<P>
"Preparing for the Division I move is good, but our priority is to get out of 
(Division II) on top," Torgeson said. "We want to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The team Northridge will field in its opener at Cal State Fullerton on Tuesday 
is a vintage mixture of pitching, speed and defense -- "a very typical 
Northridge team," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
With one notable exception: A little extra punch has been added to the 
Punch-and-Judy slap hitters for which CSUN is notorious. 
</P>
<P>
Among those providing added pop is Jeanne Mixon, a redshirt freshman who is 
expected to share designated-hitter duties with Joanna Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
More power should be generated by cleanup hitter Patty Pearson, a sophomore 
catcher, and left-fielder Erin McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
Batting leadoff will be All-American Lisa Erickson, which means Northridge will 
still have the slap-and-run and the drag bunt in its arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson has batted .420 and a school-record .459 using such techniques the 
past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A real strength for the Lady Matadors is the pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann, a three-time All-American, has used a no-nonsense approach en 
route to a 76-13 record and 53 shutouts in her career at CSUN. An intimidating 
6-foot-1, Dickmann has 468 strikeouts in 670 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Lindstrom, the Lady Matadors' most valuable player by a vote of team 
members last season, plays Tommy John to Dickmann's Nolan Ryan. Relying on 
control and a variety of off-speed pitches, Lindstrom was 22-6 with an 0.74 
earned-run average as a freshman.

ANTELOPE VALLEY DENIES QUARTZ HILL, 61-60

Trailing by a point with 14 seconds to play? Who ya gonna call? 
</P>
<P>
If you're Quartz Hill High Coach Don Moore, you have Gabe Higa's number 
memorized. 
</P>
<P>
Higa, the Rebels' 6-foot-6 senior forward, had the crowd at Quartz Hill on 
Friday night mesmerized with five three-point shots -- three of them 
NBA-distance net-shredders in the seesaw third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Higa failed to answer the call -- or even touch the ball -- in the final 
seconds of the Golden League game as Antelope Valley hung on for a dramatic 
61-60 victory before a standing-room-only crowd of about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill's Dan Prince managed a 20-foot jump shot with three seconds to 
play. But the ball bounced away from Higa, carrying with it any chance the 
Rebels might have had of catching the first-place Antelopes in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
With two games to play, Antelope Valley (19-4, 7-1 in league play) moved three 
games ahead of Quartz Hill (13-10, 4-4). 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the ball," said Higa, who scored a game-high 25 points -- 18 in the 
second half. "Scorers always think they want the ball more, right? We were 
supposed to work it inside. I'm really disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, whose team lost twice to Antelope Valley this season, conceded that the 
Antelopes succeeded in denying Higa the ball during crunch time. Forward Jabbar 
Briggs shadowed Higa throughout the game. Briggs, who scored 14 points, made 
the winning layup with 23 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's Chris Walters scored a team-high 20 points, including four 
thunderous dunks. VINCE KOWALICK

ARCADIA BEATS HART ON PENALTY KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hart High's push-came-to-shove Foothill League soccer match against Arcadia on 
Friday belonged in the Forum, where boxing and the National Hockey League are 
often featured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very much like a hockey game and not a soccer game," Arcadia Coach 
Floyd Williams said of his Apaches' 2-1 victory over Hart at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams, the coach's freshman son, scored on a penalty kick with seven 
minutes left to give Arcadia (14-5-2 overall, 9-4-1 in league play) the 
deciding goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches were awarded the penalty kick after officials charged Ruban Ramirez 
with elbowing an Arcadia player in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
The checking, however, was wild on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia's Neil Voskeritchian, who scored on a breakaway to give the Apaches a 
1-0 halftime lead, was given a yellow card in the second half for colliding 
with Hart goalkeeper Octavio Benavides. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Indian midfielder John DePaco was penalized for throwing an 
elbow at Brad Miller along the Hart sideline after the ball rolled out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Four yellow cards -- including one given to Hart Coach Robert Benavidez for 
arguing with officials before the Apaches' game-winning penalty kick -- were 
issued in the match. 
</P>
<P>
"Brutal? It's not the word for it," said Benavidez, whose Indians (13-2-4, 
7-2-4) dropped to fourth in the league standings, one point behind Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Germond scored Hart's only goal seven minutes into the second half. The 
Indians outshot Arcadia, 10-3. MIKE GLAZE

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* If your houseplants are dropping leaves, overwatering could be the cause. 
</P>
<P>
During the winter, they need less water because there are fewer hours of 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
* It's not too late to add more color to the winter garden. Check to see which 
plants are in bloom at the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
* While pruning roses, be sure to discard the old leaves and branches so they 
won't become a home for insects and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
* If you have a cool-season lawn (rye, blue, fine or tall fescue) and live in 
one of the warmer local climate zones, you'll probably need to mow it once or 
twice a week.

PUCKER UP TO THE LUSCIOUS LEMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of everything in the kitchen, perhaps only baking soda is as useful as the 
lemon -- and baking soda doesn't look nearly as pretty sitting in a bowl on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California lemon lovers who are also gardeners are lucky souls. For 
$40 to $50, you can buy a good-sized tree that will bear fruit all year and pay 
back your investment in a matter of months. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular varieties is the Eureka. Its gorgeous fruit is standard 
size, and its tree has the advantage of being thornless -- but it can also be 
rather straggly. The Lisbon will give you a fuller tree, but it does have 
thorns. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyer has thin skins and bears smaller fruit, which some people prefer. 
Especially well suited for containers is the Ponderosa, which produces gigantic 
fruit (the record was an eight-pounder grown in Whittier) and grows vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
Though lemons can take some dappled shade during the heat of the day, the ideal 
spot is sunny and warm. Plant in well-cultivated soil and dig a big hole to 
give the roots plenty of room to spread. Mounding a watering basin around the 
base is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Water a newly planted tree thoroughly once or twice a week for the first three 
months or so; stretch this schedule out to every week and a half or so after 
you start to see healthy new growth on the tree. When the tree has been in your 
yard for a year, it will need watering only every two weeks; fully mature trees 
need a good deep drink as infrequently as every six weeks -- just monitor the 
soil and weather conditions carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Feed with citrus food about three times a year. Too-frequent fertilizing can 
cause the lemons to fall off the tree or to split. 
</P>
<P>
Ree Reeder, the author of "Lemon Twist -- The No-Salt-Added Cookbook" and a 
lemon aficionado, suggests picking lemons when they're still green. "Only the 
Meyer should be picked when it's almost fully yellow," Reeder says. "If the 
fruit ripens on the tree, it loses its acidity." She says professional growers 
pick by size -- the Eureka, for instance, is 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 
virtually solid green when it is harvested. 
</P>
<P>
And that acidity is all-important: It's what gives the lemon its uncanny 
ability to masquerade as salt in foods, what helps it spur spices to new 
heights of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder will lead a talk on how to select, grow, harvest and cook lemons at 2 
p.m. Sunday at the South Coast Botanic Garden. One of the tidbits she'll be 
sharing is her prediction that, if the '80s were the decade of oat bran, the 
'90s may be the era of lemon rind. 
</P>
<P>
"Several recent studies have shown that the oil from lemon peel may reduce the 
risk of nitrite/nitrate-induced cancer," Reeder says. She recommends juicing a 
lemon and blending the juice with water and a paste you've made from pulverized 
lemon rind and sugar. "It's delicious lemonade to drink with a hot dog and may 
counteract the effects of preservatives," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The white layer of the peel contains pectin, which, according to Reeder, helps 
reduce cholesterol. "Some people say they find the white bitter, but I don't. I 
always include it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Vitamin C in lemon aids in the absorption of iron, so Reeder advocates 
using lemon-based sauces on meats and chickens to boost their nutritional 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Some other lemony tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Pick leaves from your lemon tree and coat them with chocolate for beautiful 
and easy candy leaves with which to decorate cakes or candy treats. The leaves 
are nontoxic and have a lovely shape. 
</P>
<P>
* Rub your cutting board with a squeezed lemon before you throw the lemon out 
-- the juice neutralizes even the strongest odors. 
</P>
<P>
* Mix a little lemon juice with some honey and a good splash of whiskey the 
next time you have a cough or cold. The concoction tastes delicious, soothes 
your throat and helps you sleep like a baby. 
</P>
<P>
* Comb fresh lemon juice through your hair when you're at the beach for natural 
and gentle highlights. 
</P>
<P>
* Mix a tablespoon of lemon juice with a cup of low-fat cottage cheese and 
whirl in your blender until smooth. You'll get a tasty mock sour cream with 
twice the calcium and a fraction of the fat of the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
* Make a thick potion of lemon juice and salt to clean copper and aluminum. 
Although serious coin collectors would never clean their coins this way, the 
mixture does an excellent job for pennies and is considerably safer to handle 
than caustic commercial cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
* Wrap lemons tightly in plastic and they'll keep for months in your 
refrigerator. Or leave them on your tree until you need them -- they'll be fine 
for weeks. Just remember that the riper the lemon is, the sweeter and less 
acidic it is. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder will have copies of her cookbook available for sale after her lecture. 
The book is liberally sprinkled with dozens of additional lemon facts.

BOB GREENE: SCENES FROM A BRADY DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men and women who were children during the 1970s sometimes seem to have a sort 
of collective chip on their shoulders -- and I must admit, they have some 
justification for this. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of them think the people who came before them -- Americans who grew up 
during the '50s and '60s -- are continually being catered to, with '50s and 
'60s nostalgia being dished up at every turn. This is true; there are times 
when it seems much of our current popular culture revolves around memories of 
life in the Eisenhower Era or the Kennedy Era. The children of the '70s often 
say that it seems as if their own youth never existed -- at least judging by 
the predominant media images. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the children of the '70s are in luck. Today they can feel superior. One 
of their chief cultural icons keeps getting more and more popular -- popping up 
in daily conversations, used as punch lines by young comedians, identified as a 
benchmark for a certain period of time. And I am here to confess that I know 
absolutely nothing about these cultural icons of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
I refer to the Brady Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady Bunch, it turns out, were several adults and a houseful of children 
who starred in a TV series known, appropriately enough, as "The Brady Bunch." 
The Brady family seems to be as familiar to children of the '70s as the Beatles 
were to children of the '60s, or as Lucy and Ricky were to children of the 
'50s. The Bradys, it is becoming increasingly clear, are a genuine touchstone 
for a whole generation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if the Brady Bunch -- individually or as a family -- were to walk into my 
office right this minute, I would not recognize any of them. 
</P>
<P>
I do know a few things about them. As noted, I hear their names in random 
conversations almost every day. I know they are planning some kind of a reunion 
series. I know that a TV special they did in 1988 -- a reunion special called 
"A Very Brady Christmas" -- was such a spectacular success that it was 
broadcast again this past Christmas, and even as a rerun, it was the 
highest-rated TV program in the country the night it aired. Also, I know that 
the theme song from "The Brady Bunch" has been memorized by an entire 
generation, and that it contains the word "curls." 
</P>
<P>
And even knowing all this, I do not believe I ever saw a single episode of "The 
Brady Bunch." I think I was working that decade. 
</P>
<P>
This is significant. It may mean that the children of the '70s may finally be 
getting ready to have their day in the sun. "The Brady Bunch" -- whoever they 
were -- are taking over the hearts and memories of Americans who want to think 
back to the past with warm pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
I looked up "The Brady Bunch" in a reference book. It seems the show aired on 
Friday nights on ABC from September, 1969 to August, 1974 (which explains some 
things: Friday nights between 1969 and 1974 did not tend to be a time when a 
lot of my contemporaries were home before 2 a.m., never mind watching TV). The 
reference book describes the show as "full of well-scrubbed children, trivial 
adventures, relentlessly middle-class parents (and) a nutty housekeeper, Alice, 
thrown in to act as referee; plus, of course, the family cat and a shaggy dog, 
Tiger." The actor who played a Brady son known as "Greg" was someone named 
Barry Williams -- I never saw him in my life -- who, according to the reference 
book, was such a teen-age idol that he received 6,500 fan letters a week. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure any of this needs further comment, except for two things: 
</P>
<P>
If "Brady Bunch reunion" shows are so popular today, try, if you will, to 
imagine the concept of a "Married. . .With Children" reunion show 20 years from 
now. 
</P>
<P>
And, you know how the mothers in all the family comedies of the '50s and '60s 
were supposed to be bland and unsexy -- sort of matronly and prim and dowdy? 
Most of them were. But -- and I don't know how we missed it back then -- did 
you ever take a real close look at Donna Reed?

LAKERS END BRIEF TIME OF FUTILITY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: WORTHY, IN WRONG PLACE AT RIGHT TIME, INTERCEPTS PASS AND HITS 
KEY SHOT TO HELP BEAT ATLANTA, 112-106. LOS ANGELES ENDS TWO-GAME LOSING 
STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alarmists who were wringing their hands and gnashing their teeth after two 
consecutive Laker losses had reason to be less than totally satisfied with 
Friday night's partial return to form in a 112-106 victory over the Atlanta 
Hawks at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Showing little outward sign of a problem, the Lakers maintained a slim lead for 
best record in the Western Conference and -- at times -- showed flashes of 
their dominance on a recent Eastern trip. 
</P>
<P>
What more could you want? 
</P>
<P>
Well, perhaps a more convincing victory. The Hawks, after all, have been 
decimated by injuries. Three Atlanta starters are injured, and the Hawks had 
lost seven of 10 games before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, leading by 10 points with 5:07 to play, went into a late 
tailspin, and the Hawks pulled to within three before a clutch steal and basket 
by James Worthy finished them. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Lakers (32-11) had been playing so well before their losing streak 
-- which was helped along by Magic Johnson's bout with the flu -- Friday 
night's performance paled in comparison to earlier play. But the Lakers showed 
enough efficiency to build a double-figure second-half lead and protect it. 
</P>
<P>
"We came off the road and we took a sigh of relief," Laker Coach Pat Riley 
said. "Now, we've just got to catch it back to the way we were. That happens 
during the season. But the whole priority tonight was just to win. We had to 
get out of that (losing streak)." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers accomplished that. Although they could not put away the Hawks, the 
Lakers showed enough positive signs for all but the most severe critics to be 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
They shot 55%. They had seven players in double figures. They held their own 
rebounding against the taller, more physical Hawks. And, in the end, they made 
the big plays to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Individually, the Lakers had to be heartened by the shooting of guard Byron 
Scott, who appears to be emerging from a season-long slump. Scott made nine of 
11 shots and led the Lakers with 20 points. In his last three games, Scott has 
sunk 26 of 42 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The last four or five games, it's been going good," said Scott, whose left 
hamstring still is slightly weakened from last season's injury. "I've got the 
lift back in my legs. The (left) leg is getting stronger. Tonight, Earvin 
(Johnson) did an excellent job of getting me the ball at the right time and the 
right spot." 
</P>
<P>
Power forward A.C. Green ended a brief slump by scoring 15 points and grabbing 
seven rebounds, and center Mychal Thompson had 17 points -- two below his 
season high. Orlando Woolridge and Vlade Divac each came off the bench to score 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson fell only a rebound short of a triple-double. He scored 19 points and 
had 13 assists and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Worthy, who tied his season low with only 10 points, made the play that 
repelled the Hawks for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had gone scoreless for about 3 1/2 minutes, enabling Dominique 
Wilkins (36 points) and his cohorts to cut the deficit to 105-102. After Green 
missed a long jump shot simply to beat the shot clock, the Hawks had the ball 
with 1:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
With Laker players scrambling to return to their men after a brief front-court 
trap, Worthy found himself guarding Hawk guard John Long. Worthy started a move 
toward Antoine Carr, the player for whom he was responsible, but instead 
knocked down and then retrieved Long's pass. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy gathered the ball on the run and converted a fast-break dunk with 1:27 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen their pattern the whole game, how they did a good job swinging the 
ball around," Worthy said. "I was able to fake like I was going back to my man, 
and I was right there to take the pass." 
</P>
<P>
That Worthy basket gave the Lakers a 107-102 lead, and Atlanta (21-22) went 
into a futile succession of fouls. The Lakers converted most of free throws, 
sending what was left of 17,505 fans to the exits only a little early. 
</P>
<P>
As pleased as the Lakers were to end the losing streak, they knew they still 
have a way to go to return to the dominating play they showed in road victories 
over Detroit, New York and Indiana late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's bout with the flu, which coincided with the losses to San Antonio and 
the Clippers, obviously played a vital part. But the Lakers seemed to, in 
Riley's words, "exhale" before that. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really relax (in) these last couple games," Worthy said. "Maybe we 
just got a little comfortable being at home. It may not be easy, but I think we 
can get back to where we were before." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Michael Cooper still were recovering from the flu. Johnson said he 
became "out of shape" after spending about three days in bed. He said he could 
feel the effects in the fourth quarter when he missed shots he usually makes. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, after the Laker lead had been cut to four points with about three 
minutes to play, Johnson drove the lane but missed a short push shot. On the 
Lakers' next possession, he missed again on a similar drive. Johnson made only 
five of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"My timing is just off," Johnson said. "There were three of four shots there I 
usually make. I got to work now on getting back my timing and get back in 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by Friday's result, the Lakers, as a group, have taken the initial 
steps round back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quintin Dailey was a Laker for only a week during training camp before being 
waived, and the club is paying the bulk of his $400,000 contract after signing 
him during the off-season. After he was signed to a 10-day contract by Seattle, 
his former teammates had a few things to say. "I knew he'd make it back," Laker 
center Mychal Thompson said. "I'm sure (being waived by the Lakers) opened his 
eyes and told him that, no matter how much talent you have, you have to take 
the responsibilities. I'm sure it was humbling for him." 
</P>
<P>
Added Larry Drew, the Lakers' backup point guard: "I'm pulling for him, because 
this may finally be his last go-around." . . . Vlade Divac, the Lakers' rookie 
center from Yugoslavia, turned 22 today. "I feel old," Divac said, laughing. In 
case you're wondering, "Sretan Rodendan" means happy birthday in 
Serbo-Croatian, Divac's native tongue. . . . Divac is required to complete one 
year of mandatory military service before age 29. With Yugoslavia on the verge 
of a civil war between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo, 
Thompson jokingly speculated that Divac might be called back. "Hey, that would 
mean more minutes for me," said Thompson, taking the world view. . . . The 
Lakers are off today and play the New Jersey Nets at the Forum on Sunday night.

PAULEY PAVILION: UCLA CELEBRATES 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ARENA WHERE JOHN WOODEN 
WON EIGHT OF HIS 10 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS BY HANGING UP JERSEYS OF LEW ALCINDOR 
AND BILL WALTON TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1949, in his first year as basketball coach at UCLA, long before wizard and 
Westwood started being used in the same sentence, John Wooden began each 
practice by dust-mopping the floor of Men's Gym. 
</P>
<P>
He used special oversized mops of his own design that he coaxed the school's 
maintenance department to make. After Wooden and the team managers had made 
sure that the dirt on the practice court had been swept away by a broom, he 
would sprinkle water in front of the oncoming six-foot mops, covered with 
towels. 
</P>
<P>
That was how practice began on the second floor of Men's Gym, where basketball 
workouts shared space with wrestling mats and gymnastics equipment, such as 
trampolines. Students sometimes visited during basketball practice and started 
bouncing on the trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to facetiously say, when coeds in leotards would come use the 
trampolines, that the players would notice them -- and of course I wouldn't," 
Wooden said. 
</P>
<P>
The practice routine never varied, though, and it was always in the same 
cramped, dusty locale, the upper floor of a building erected in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
What were called UCLA home games were not often played at UCLA, although the 
last Bruin game at Men's Gym was not until March, 1959. Wooden's Bruins played 
most of their home games at the Sports Arena, Santa Monica City College, Venice 
High School, Long Beach City College, Long Beach Auditorium and Pan Pacific 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I had wanted a place and had been led to believe when I came to UCLA that 
within three years we would have a nice place on campus," Wooden said. "Of 
course, we didn't get it until after I had been there 17 years." 
</P>
<P>
For the last 25 years, though, UCLA has had that nice place on campus. Pauley 
Pavilion, named after the former head of the State Board of Regents, is marking 
a quarter of a century of existence. In conjunction with the season-long 
observance of its anniversary, the No. 33 UCLA jersey of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
who was Lew Alcindor in his UCLA days, and the No. 32 jersey of Bill Walton 
will be retired today in a ceremony at halftime of UCLA's game against DePaul. 
The jerseys of women's stars Ann Meyers and Denise Curry also will be retired. 
</P>
<P>
When the building was still in the planning stages, Wooden fought for extra 
room along the sidelines and in the end zones, as well as for visiting locker 
rooms equal in size to UCLA's. Those were courtesies, he said, that should be 
extended if under one's control. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that our winning the (national) championship in 1964 and then 
repeating it in 1965 was far more amazing than winning afterwards when we got 
to Pauley Pavilion," Wooden said. "In 1964, for example, Alcindor was a junior 
in New York City and (winning the national championship) attracted his 
attention. In his senior year, we repeated as champions and that solidified his 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"And when he visited us in that April, one of the things that I could do was 
take him up to Pauley Pavilion (and say), 'Now that's going to be open, 
(you're) going to play the first game ever played in it.' I think it's one of 
the reasons Alcindor came. And of course, that's what helped us get a string 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he wouldn't have come if we hadn't had Pauley Pavilion. But on the 
other hand, he wouldn't have come had we not won in '64 and '65 and attracted 
his attention." 
</P>
<P>
Since it opened in the fall of 1965, the Bruins have a 360-37 record there. In 
the first 10 years at Pauley, UCLA was 149-2. The Bruins once won 98 
consecutive games there. The streak started with the 1970-'71 season opener and 
finally was ended on Feb. 21, 1976, when Oregon State won, 65-45. There are 10 
NCAA championship banners hanging in Pauley and Abdul-Jabbar and Walton were 
around for five of them. Wooden, of course, was there for all 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had a part in it, of course," Wooden said. "But no coach has an 
exceptional record if he doesn't have exceptional players. I'm not trying to be 
naive or excessively modest or anything because just as quickly I'd say not 
every coach does well with exceptional players. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I was part of building the tradition, but I was just a part." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar and Walton played major parts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there's been a more valuable player in college basketball than 
Kareem," Wooden said. "And I think that's pretty well proven. He would have to 
be considered the main cog in our three consecutive national championships. 
Now, of course, no other team has ever won three consecutive national 
championships. We won seven. I honestly think that had he been eligible as a 
freshman, we'd have won one more (which would have made it a mind-boggling 10 
NCAA titles in a row). 
</P>
<P>
"There were plenty of opposing coaches who said, 'Wait till he's gone, they'll 
get their comeuppance.' But after he graduated, we won two more in succession 
with Steve Patterson as center. He's sort of the answer to the trivia question: 
'Who is the center of the national championship teams between Alcindor and 
Walton?' 
</P>
<P>
"Then Walton came. I would say that in many respects, and I've tried to be as 
objective as possible, that Kareem is the most valuable player because he put 
more of a burden on the opposing teams at each end of the court than Bill. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, if you graded the players on all the fundamental aspects 
of the game on, say, a one-to-10 basis -- passing, defense, rebounding, 
outletting, shooting -- I think that Bill might have the higher rating of the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say then that Bill would be the better basketball player, but Kareem 
is more valuable. Well, that's altogether possible." 
</P>
<P>
In those Camelot years at UCLA, when Alcindor and Walton each staked his claim 
as the dominant center of the day, it was at Pauley they displayed their 
magical powers. 
</P>
<P>
'THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER' 
</P>
<P>
The very first game played in Pauley Pavilion was on Nov. 27, 1965. It matched 
the two-time defending NCAA champion UCLA Bruins, ranked No. 1 in the preseason 
polls, and the UCLA freshman team, led by the 7-foot-1, 18-year-old Alcindor 
from Power Memorial High in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"That intra-squad game was weird for me," Abdul-Jabbar recalls. "I can remember 
before the game, I didn't know what to think because I thought we could beat 
them, but I really didn't feel that it was appropriate for me to speculate 
about it. So I didn't. After all, it was the Bruins playing the Bruins. I tried 
to keep my emotions out of it." 
</P>
<P>
But the varsity couldn't keep his shots out of the basket. Before 12,051, 
Abdul-Jabbar scored 31 points and had 21 rebounds in a startling 75-60 victory 
for the freshmen. Two other prep All-Americans on the freshman team were guard 
Lucius Allen from Kansas and forward Lynn Shackleford from Burroughs High in 
Burbank. The varsity was led by forwards Edgar Lacy and Mike Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead 36-31 at halftime, the freshmen went on a 10-0 run early in the second 
half, Abdul-Jabbar scoring six of the points in that span. That intra-squad 
game, is regarded as a watershed game in UCLA history. But at the time, 
Abdul-Jabbar was not thinking about history being made. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt kind of odd that we could beat a varsity Pac-8 team like that," he 
said. "You know, before the game, our assistant coach, Jake Hardy, said 'Listen 
you guys, play hard, you'll beat that team by 15 points.' That's just what he 
said. And that was exactly the score. 
</P>
<P>
"All I remember is they couldn't press us and we were faster than they were. We 
broke the press real easy. They'd pass it to me and I'd come up by our free 
throw line in the backcourt there and I'd just hit guys cutting left or right 
and they beat them down the court. That was an easy game for us." 
</P>
<P>
Once Abdul-Jabbar became eligible for the varsity team as a sophomore, there 
were whole series of easy games. He scored 56 points against USC in his first 
varsity game and 61 against Washington State, both at Pauley. He scored lots of 
his points on dunks, a shot that the NCAA banned after Abdul-Jabbar's sophomore 
year. But if Abdul-Jabbar's headlines emanated from his shooting the ball, he 
got perhaps his greatest pleasure out of passing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always enjoyed it because it was like automatic layups," he said. "I just 
enjoyed spreading it around. It was fun. The game was fun and easy. We got our 
challenge out of how well we could execute the things Coach Wooden wanted us 
to. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the game I most remember is when we played Colorado State my 
sophomore year. They were solid and they gave us a tough game." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who featured power players such as 6-8 Bob Rule, 6-10 Dale Schlueter 
and 6-10 Mike Davis, twice cut UCLA's lead to one point, but the Bruins won, 
84-74, on Dec. 22, 1966, in Pauley. Against double- and triple-team defenses, 
Abdul-Jabbar had 34 points, 20 rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, that game was crucial because I developed a lot of confidence in Coach 
Wooden and what he knew," Abdul-Jabbar said. "He knew how to use his weapons a 
lot more effectively than other coaches. Those other games where I scored a lot 
of points, they weren't really challenges. This one, we were being tested. And 
Coach Wooden had all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar said that if he were athletic director, he would make one change 
at Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted them to have the seats come up to the end lines," he said. "I 
always thought that that took away from some of our home-court advantage. They 
could put risers there. 
</P>
<P>
"Pauley helped sell me on wanting to come to UCLA. When I came out to visit, 
they hadn't put the floor in. They had finished everything but the floor. So 
the floor was just a big concrete slab. You know, I walked in the building, and 
geez, that was a very impressive building in 1965. It was state of the art. And 
it's still on a par with the best arenas as far as sight lines and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, 42, divides his time between Bel-Air and Hawaii. His second book, 
a diary of his final season with the Lakers, is due out shortly. 
</P>
<P>
'THE BETTER PLAYER' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walton said the Bruins played a lot of good games at Pauley during his 
tenure in Westwood, but there was a pretty fair explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we had such a great basketball team," he said. "We shouldn't have 
ever lost any of the games we played, but we did. But some of the most special 
memories I have of Pauley would have been in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We had incredibly competitive practices. And Coach Wooden was just really an 
inspirational leader in terms of conducting practice and the importance of 
practice. I loved them. 
</P>
<P>
"Practice was just war out there. In 1974, we had a lot of great players on the 
second string -- Swen Nater, Andre McCarter, Marques Johnson, Richard 
Washington, Ralph Drollinger. Everybody knew that if you didn't produce, you 
were going to the bench and somebody else is going to be out there playing. You 
know, playing time is a very special deal." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the special games Walton played at Pauley, perhaps the one that is most 
remembered would be the UCLA-Notre Dame game of Jan. 26, 1974. The week before, 
Notre Dame had beaten UCLA in South Bend, 71-70, ending the Bruins' 88-game 
winning streak. Suddenly, the national rankings were reversed, Notre Dame was 
No. 1 and UCLA No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In the first meeting, the Irish had overcome a 70-59 UCLA lead with 3:30 to go 
by holding the Bruins without a point. Walton had played, wearing a reinforced 
corset to protect a broken bone in his back. He scored 24 points and had nine 
rebounds in his first game in two weeks. But when UCLA got its chance for 
revenge at Pauley, the Bruins did not miss it. Walton made 16 of 19 shots, 
scored 32 points and had 11 rebounds in a 94-75 victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the Bruins had their 60th consecutive victory at Pauley. At that time, the 
UCLA team was also known as the Walton Gang, and on that day, the leader was, 
well, pumped up. 
</P>
<P>
"I get pretty fired up for basketball games," Walton said. "That's one of the 
things I like about basketball, you can get really fired up and go out there 
and just let it all go. You can show your emotions. It's a total physical, 
psychological and mental release. It is one that I just really miss releasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in practice at Pauley, you had to have the attitude that the person you 
are practicing against is the best in the world. Coach Wooden was able to get 
that across to us. We believed him . . . and we still believe him. 
</P>
<P>
"There were just so many players around who had phenomenal athletic ability and 
Coach Wooden was just molding us all into fine young basketball players. The 
enthusiasm and the optimism and the whole atmosphere and attitude that 
surrounded the team -- we were expected to win the championship and not winning 
every game would be considered a failure. That was the feeling we got in Pauley 
or just hanging around Coach Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an unbelievably special person. You know, you look at him and you watch 
him and you live with the guy during the season. You see all this greatness 
about him and he's always coming up with something better. He was perfect for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"Pauley Pavilion was, by far, the nicest building in the country for college 
basketball. The first time I went was one of Kareem's last games. My older 
brother and I went up there together. He went up there on a recruiting trip. My 
brother, Bruce, played football at UCLA and I sort of tagged along. I was a 
junior (in high school). You know, UCLA was recruiting me, but this wasn't an 
official visit or anything. When I walked inside, I just said, 'Hey, I want to 
do this -- this looks perfect for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hesitation or doubt in my mind that UCLA was where I wanted to 
go. And Pauley Pavilion played such a big part in that. Of course, Coach Wooden 
played a much bigger part." 
</P>
<P>
Walton, 37, lives near San Diego and spends most of his time doing charity work 
and being with his four sons, who are 14, 12, 9, and 8.

HORSE RACING: MICHELLE ARMSTRONG WILL HAVE TO WATCH TELEVISION FROM HER BED TO 
SEE BILL SHOEMAKER'S FINAL RIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The last time Michelle Armstrong saw Bill Shoemaker, she got his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when Shoemaker, 58, appears at Santa Anita for the last ride of his 
career, 15-year-old Michelle will see him again. 
</P>
<P>
But she'll have to settle for watching television, which is carrying a delayed 
showing of the Legend's Last Ride Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Armstrong is a patient at the City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, where 
she underwent surgery two weeks ago for a bone-marrow transplant in her battle 
with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, who has a Peruvian Paso filly that was a gift from Stuart Hamblen, 
the late singing cowboy, composer and trainer, has the same hope as Shoemaker. 
They would both like to be successful trainers some day. Michelle has had that 
ambition since she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
Since Michelle learned she had cancer, she has been befriended by a wide 
segment of the racing community. 
</P>
<P>
She has gone to the Kentucky Derby twice and the Belmont Stakes. She has met 
trainers Wayne Lukas, Charlie Whittingham and Louie Roussel, and jockeys Gary 
Stevens and Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
She saw Stevens win the Kentucky Derby with Lukas' Winning Colors, watched 
Whittingham's Derby victory with Sunday Silence and saw Delahoussaye win the 
Belmont on Roussel's Risen Star. 
</P>
<P>
At the Belmont, Michelle didn't know what to do, because she liked both Winning 
Colors and Risen Star, having met their trainers and jockeys. She had her 
mother, Karen, bet both horses. It's not a smart way to play the races, but 
it's a way to satisfy your heart. 
</P>
<P>
Roussel invited Michelle to the winner's circle after Risen Star's victory. 
Roussel especially identified with Michelle because he had once suffered from 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle will have mixed emotions about Shoemaker's last ride today, because 
Stevens and Delahoussaye are also in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, who lives in Klamath Falls, Ore., met Shoemaker at Portland Meadows 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say very much, but he was nice and autographed a poster and a sweat 
shirt for me," Michelle said from her hospital bed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle found out a lot later than many people that Shoemaker is aptly called 
Silent Shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Armstrong has written a poem in honor of Shoemaker's retirement: 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the jockeys throughout time, there are really few 
</P>
<P>
 Who stand out in racing history like the one they call the Shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 When riding any of his mounts, he never asks too much; 
</P>
<P>
 A jockey with such balance, and gentleness of touch. 
</P>
<P>
 A career that spans six decades would be pretty hard to beat; 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a really mighty man to accomplish such a feat! 
</P>
<P>
 In February of 1990, the world will watch with pride 
</P>
<P>
 As the great Shoe climbs up in the irons to make his final ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheers for Willie Shoemaker will be ringing in our ears, 
</P>
<P>
 And some will probably find it hard to stop the tears. 
</P>
<P>
 So thanks for all the memories, Shoe . . . for each and every thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 May God watch over and keep you safe, all America loves you, Bill! 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cassie, her 13-year-old sister, and Booter, a 6-year-old brother, were 
eligible to be Michelle Armstrong's donor for the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Cassie became the donor. After the surgery, she was asked if she felt sore. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like I've been riding on the bus all day," Cassie Armstrong said.

JANET EVANS THRIVING AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDVINS BEITIKS, SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
STANFORD, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Evans knew she was going to be asked, again, about the Olympics, and her 
eyes glazed over a little. After a long afternoon's workout at deGuerre Pool 
she would rather have talked about the here and now -- about Saturday's meet 
between Stanford and Texas, the No.-1 and No.-2 women's swimming teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm really psyched up for it," said Placentia's Evans, holder of three 
world records, three American records and three gold medals from the 1988 
Olympics. "If we do well against Texas, it'll help our mind-set for the NCAAs, 
something we're all looking forward to." 
</P>
<P>
Evans talked about her first year with the Cardinals -- she has won 16 of her 
22 races and finished no lower than third. Not coincidentally, she is 6-0 and 
has won 13 straight dual meets, dating back to the 1988 season. The team, rated 
No.-1 in women's swimming all year, is coming off lopsided 104-36 and 117-16 
wins over Arizona and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, 7-0 this season, are ranked second in the nation. They are led 
by Leigh Ann Fetter, Amy Shaw and Andrea Hayes, who will likely swim against 
Evans in the longer freestyle races. Handicapping the meet, Evans said, "We 
have to swim as fast as we can, and I think we'll be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But then the subject turned, out of her hands, toward the 1988 Olympics in 
Seoul, when Evans was the designated pixie of the press, America's Sweetheart, 
the high school senior from Placentia, Calif., who went from three gold medals 
to being Grand Marshal of both the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the 
Fiesta Bowl. Those were the days when TV mini-cams would chase her around the 
campus at El Dorado High to get quotes, remembered Evans, who opted to come to 
Stanford after being wooed by a dozen schools, including Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've come here I think the craziness has really died down," said Evans, 
18. "Sometimes someone will recognize me -- I can see them say to themselves, 
'Is that her?' -- but they leave me pretty much alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy training with the team," said Evans, adding that emotion for 
the dual meet against Texas is running high. "It's just as intense as it was at 
the Olympics, even more intense. The difference at the Olympics is you're just 
swimming by yourself -- here it's the whole team, you're all in it together." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 5-6, 110, has qualified for the NCAA finals in four events since coming 
to Stanford -- the 500, 1000 and 1650-yard freestyle and the 400 individual 
medley. She has improved from a time of 2:08.35 in the 200 fly on Jan. 6 to a 
time of 2:04.61 two weeks later, from a time of 2:03.53 in the 200 free in 
December to a time of 1:50.71 on Jan. 26, and from a time of 9:45.41 in the 
1000 freestyle Jan. 6 to a time of 9:32.63 against Arizona last weekend, only 
seven seconds off her American record. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Arizona I was swimming my best," said Evans, who practices up to five 
hours a day, a regimen she's maintained for six years. To keep from drowning in 
boredom on the endless laps, Evans will talk to herself, "sing a song, think 
about how much homework I've got to do when I get back ..." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way ever since junior high, she explained -- while her friends 
went to drive-ins and Friday night dances, she would be making another circle 
around the pool. "I used to think, 'Look at all the things they get to do,' but 
then look at the things I've been able to do that they haven't, so it kind of 
balanced out." 
</P>
<P>
Evans wasn't sure she was good enough to be a top swimmer until she went to the 
Goodwill Games in 1986 and barely missed making the world team. That's when she 
realized "I really enjoy competing, seeing the rewards of working hard," said 
Evans, adding, "For some reason I've always been better at distance. I've never 
been a sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she won gold medals at Seoul in the 400 individual medley, the 
800-meter freestyle and the 400-meter freestyle -- setting the world record -- 
that America sat up and took notice, and ever since then Evans has been trying 
to get things back to normal. "I'm surprised at how genuine she is," said 
swimming coach Richard Quick. "She doesn't have one bone of prima donna in 
her." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Evans signed a commitment to come to Stanford last May, Quick said, 
"Obviously, I feel we've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history ... the things that she has already accomplished are without precedent 
in United States swimming." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, he's even more impressed since Evans has come to Stanford, 
explained Quick. "I've never seen anybody so consistent in the hours she puts 
into practice. She puts more time into swimming than anyone I've ever heard of" 
</P>
<P>
Every serious swimmer puts in a lot of hours, said Evans, but it takes more 
than that. "A lot of it is in your head. You've got to have the confidence you 
can do it. I think 50 percent of it is in your head ... believing you can win."

DRAG RACING WINTERNATONALS; 
</P>
<P>
NO LONGER FUNNY, BERNSTEIN IS STILL FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three weeks ago, Kenny Bernstein wasn't sure he made the right decision in 
switching from a funny car to a top fuel dragster. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, testing in Bakersfield, I was asking myself if I'd ever get used 
to the feeling you get from a top fuel car," the four-time National Hot Rod 
Assn. funny car champion said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're two totally different animals, and I'm not completely comfortable yet. 
In my funny car, I felt the way you do about an old pair of shoes -- real 
comfortable. I'm a long way from that in a top fueler, but today helped." 
</P>
<P>
In Bernstein's first official pass in a top fuel dragster, he clocked 5.097 
seconds for the quarter-mile dash down the asphalt strip at the L. A. County 
Fairplex track in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the quickest I've ever gone, and it sure felt it," Bernstein said. His 
quickest funny car ride was 5.25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Only veteran Frank Bradley, who has been driving top fuel missiles for 27 
years, was quicker in the first round of qualifying for Sunday's Chief Auto 
Parts Winternationals. Bradley, driving a two-year-old car, ran 5.071 seconds 
and predicted a sub-five-second run before the weekend is out. 
</P>
<P>
"If the weather stays the way it was today, I think runs in the fours are a 
definite possibility," Bradley said. "I like Pomona. It's my favorite track, 
and the NHRA has it prepared perfectly. The drivers couldn't ask for anything 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley ran 4.998 last October in the Winston Finals at Pomona, a record that 
was bettered in the same meet by Darrell Gwynn, who ran a 4.957. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between top fuel machines and funny cars, Bernstein said, lies 
in the feeling he gets when the car is slightly out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
"In a funny car, the weight is in the center of the car, and you can feel what 
it's doing in the seat of your pants and correct any problem before it gets out 
of hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a top fueler, the weight is in the back, and when it gets squirrelly you 
don't get that feeling until it's already happening, and that's too late. I 
don't have a problem getting the car from point A to point B, but when it gets 
out of shape, that's where I need more experience. I still don't feel like it's 
my office yet." 
</P>
<P>
There was a marked contrast between Bernstein, 45, the rookie funny car driver 
from Newport Beach, and Bradley, 47, the veteran from Santa Rosa, in their 
preparation for Friday's qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, with a new car prepared by Dale Armstrong, had 18 runs during 
extensive testing at Phoenix and Bakersfield, the latter on the old Famoso Drag 
Strip where the Bakersfield March Meets were legendary events 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we made a few half-passes, but we kept busy," Bernstein said. "Six 
of the runs were full passes. We ran a 5.15 at Bakersfield last Sunday on a 
pretty marginal track and had a 5.16 at Firebird (in Chandler, Ariz.)." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley did nothing to his car over the winter except repaint it with the logo 
of a new sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't bad for the first run after sitting in the garage all winter," 
Bradley said. He lost in the finals at Pomona last October to Joe Amato. 
</P>
<P>
Don (Snake) Prudhomme, also making the switch from funny car to top fueler, ran 
a 5.159 and was in seventh position. Amato, who ran against Prudhomme, had the 
day's top speed of 282.39 m.p.h. in 5.112 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first concern was to get down the race track, and we did it," said 
Prudhomme, who was a top fuel champion before changing to funny cars in 1973. 
"We're happy with the way things are going. We're going to gradually step up 
and understand what the motor wants." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Muldowney, making her first run for car owner Larry Minor in a new Al 
Swindahl-production, qualified fifth at 5.137. 
</P>
<P>
Funny car veteran John Force of Yorba Linda broke the Winternationals record 
with a clocking of 5.288 seconds in his '88 Olds Cutlass. It bettered the 
record of 5.320 by Winston champion Bruce Larson and just missed the track 
standard of 5.280 set by Mark Oswald last October in the Winston Finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice getting to the end of the track in one piece, after the way we 
left motors on the ground testing in Phoenix," Force said. "We left a real iron 
pile over there. It's good I have a lot of sponsors who can spend money, 
because I had a lot of motor breakage. They've been patient, and now I want to 
repay them." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Force will ride in a completely new honeycomb body that is 50 pounds 
lighter than the one he ran Friday. "If we get everything figured out on the 
computer, it should be a lot faster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Eckman of Ventura surprised even himself when he led pro stock qualifiers 
with a time of 7.371 seconds in a Pontiac Trans Am. He has never been the No. 1 
qualifier at an NHRA meet. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's opening round was canceled because of strong crosswinds. Two runs 
today, at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., will set the 16-car fields for eliminations on 
Sunday.

COOKE DISCUSSED STADIUM PLANS WITH D.C. MAYOR MARION BARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
One day before he was arrested, Mayor Marion Barry met for several hours with 
Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke at Cooke's Middleburg, Va., estate to 
discuss specific plans for a 78,000-seat stadium next to RFK Stadium, sources 
have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
At the Jan. 17 meeting, Cooke presented plans for the stadium, complete with 
lucrative skyboxes and other amenities, according to a monthly report on 
commercial real-estate circulated this week to area real-estate executives. It 
was believed to be the first time Cooke has shown plans for his stadium to D.C. 
Armory Board officials, who had expressed impatience with Cooke on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting, Cooke reportedly even conceded to having high-rise parking 
built instead of taking nine holes of the (Langston) golf course," according to 
the public-relations firm of Arthur J. Schultz and Co., which writes the report 
for Smithy Braedon, a commercial real-estate services company. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke declined comment. Artis Hampshire-Cowan, general counsel to the Armory 
Board, called the meeting "good and fruitful," but refused to discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
Hampshire-Cowan said that despite Barry's arrest and subsequent decision to 
enter a rehabilitation center in Florida, negotiations between Cooke and the 
Armory Board are "on the fast track." 
</P>
<P>
She said she spoke to Barry the day after his arrest specifically about the 
stadium. "The mayor and I discussed what's going on with the stadium and he 
instructed me to proceed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Redskins' 30-year lease on RFK Stadium set to expire at the end of the 
year, Cooke told Barry in a Dec. 13, 1989, letter obtained by The Washington 
Post that he still wanted to build a stadium next to RFK but was exploring 
"other locations for the new stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said that major environmental problems may make it extremely 
difficult for Cooke to begin construction of a stadium in the District. 
</P>
<P>
Among concerns is the issue of filling in a portion of the Anacostia River and 
reconfiguring parts of Langston Golf Course to make room for the stadium and 
parking. But that problem might be solved with Cooke's reported interest in 
high-rise parking. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting between Cooke and Armory Board officials is scheduled for early 
March, according to the Smithy Braedon report.

RAIDERS PROTECT MCELROY, PICKEL; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SAFETIES HARDEN AND CARTER CONSIDERED MORE EXPENDABLE THAN 
BACKUPS WRIGHT, HORTON AND TURK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Since they're Raiders and march to their own drummer, nothing they do comes as 
a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it wasn't a stunner Friday when their protected list for Group B free 
agency included not only the names of running back Marcus Allen and linebacker 
Jerry Robinson -- Coach Art Shell had said it would -- but safety Vann McElroy 
and defensive tackle Bill Pickel. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was it shocking that they are dangling both their strong safeties, starter 
Mike Harden and Russell Carter, thereby showing that they deem backup 
journeymen Steve Wright, Dan Turk and Ethan Horton more valuable than Harden. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the cases that might normally be termed upsets: 
</P>
<P>
 -- McElroy. He's 30, made $595,000 last season, became the first Raider in 
known history to be asked to sign an injury waiver on his contract, did in fact 
get hurt, missed all but five games and lost his free safety job to Eddie 
Anderson. His contract is up and he wants a raise or a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Why did they protect him? 
</P>
<P>
Either because Shell still wants him, or they think he has trade value and want 
control over his movements. They don't need him in Seattle drawing a bead on 
Tim Brown's ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pickel. He's 30, will make $585,000 this season, has gone downhill after 
his fine 1983-86 seasons and was used sparingly last season, although he still 
tries hard. They attempted to trade him last summer but couldn't land a premium 
draft choice. Either Shell wants him, or they want to get a No. 5 pick for him 
or think they're already too thin on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harden. He was impressive after coming from Denver, where he had refused to 
move to cornerback to accommodate rookie Steve Atwater. He was all the more 
valuable to the Raiders in that he called the defensive signals, taking that 
burden off Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders must be gambling on sliding him through because of his age and 
salary. He is reportedly in the $400,000 range but won't be 30 until Feb. 16, 
and the fact that Carter is also unprotected makes this risky. 
</P>
<P>
Left unprotected, along with Harden and Carter, were cornerback Mike Haynes; 
guard Dale Hellestrae, who was just signed as a Plan B; linebacker Ricky 
Hunley; tight end Trey Junkin, made dispensable by the rise of Mike Dyal; 
linebacker Linden King, called out of retirement last season; linebacker 
Emanuel King, whom they don't have to worry about losing because he is a backup 
with a $475,000 salary, and center Bill Lewis, the '88 outstanding lineman by 
his teammates' vote who already has gotten two calls, including one from the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Also left unprotected were safety Stefon Adams, an old Al Davis favorite who 
shouldn't have fielded that punt in the Meadowlands finale at his three-yard 
line; kick returner Bobby Joe Edmonds; defensive end Mark Mraz, an 
exhibition-season sensation for registering a few sacks who didn't pan out; 
running back Kerry Porter, running back Steve Strachan, guard Newt Harrell and 
ex-Trojan wide receiver Timmie Ware. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Raiders signed 14 Plan B free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14, eight have been cut and two aren't being protected. The survivors 
are defensive tackle Bob Golic, linebacker Tom Benson, wide receiver Sam Graddy 
and kicker Jeff Jaeger.

Keena Turner, Mike Wilson and Eric Wright, who played on all four San Francisco 
49er Super Bowl championship teams, were left available to other teams as free 
agents in the NFL's Plan B marketplace Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also failed to protect tight end Brent Jones, who caught a touchdown 
pass in the 55-10 Super Bowl rout of Denver, and punter Barry Helton. The AFC 
champion Denver Broncos left three regulars off their protected list: 
linebacker Rick Dennison, tight end Clarence Kay and punter Mike Horan. 
</P>
<P>
The list of 490 players released by the NFL includes several well-known names. 
They included several prominent quarterbacks: Doug Williams of Washington, the 
1988 Super Bowl most valuable player who has been bothered by injuries the past 
two seasons; Tommy Kramer of Minnesota; Ron Jaworski of Kansas City and 
ex-Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie of New England. 
</P>
<P>
The players may sign with any other team until April 1 with no compensation due 
their old teams. In addition, 274 other players had contracts that expired at 
midnight Thursday and are free agents subject to first refusal by their former 
clubs. Those players included Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski and Minnesota 
wide receiver Anthony Carter. 
</P>
<P>
If Turner, Wilson and Wright sign with other teams, it would leave quarterback 
Joe Montana and safety Ronnie Lott as the last 49ers to have played on all the 
championship teams. Turner is a linebacker, Wilson a wide receiver and Wright a 
two-time Pro Bowl defensive back who lost his starting job last season. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the 49ers put 20 players on their Plan B list, including nose 
tackle Jim Burt, linebacker and special teams player Steve Hendrickson, 
defensive end Pete Kugler, running back Harry Sydney, guard Terry Tausch and 
running back Spencer Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's list included running back-wide receiver Ken Bell, guard Keith Bishop, 
linebacker Scott Curtis, defensive back Mike Haynes, linebacker Bruce 
Klostermann, linebacker Tim Lucas, center Mike Ruether and running back Sammy 
Winder. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys left unprotected defensive end Ed (Too Tall) Jones, a 
14-year veteran who started his 200th consecutive game this season. The Giants 
left off running backs Joe Morris, out all last year with a broken foot, and 
his replacement, Ottis Anderson.

Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, has begun an investigation of its 
basketball program in response to problems on the team, including reports that 
players are upset with Coach Tom Abatemarco. 
</P>
<P>
University President Michael F. Ferrari said he decided an investigation was 
needed after administrators reviewed incidents involving team members, possible 
violations of "academic honesty policies" and the recent departure of three 
players as well as the actions of the coaching staff.

Sandra Harris, mother of West Virginia quarterback Major Harris, says she is

has decided to forgo his final year of eligibility and turn pro. 
</P>

"Major hasn't made any decision yet as far as I know," she said. "I don't think 
he's hired an agent or done any of the things they say he's done."

Steffi Graf extended her singles winning streak to 50 matches today by breezing 
past Soviet Larisa Savchenko, 6-0, 6-3, in the quarterfinals of the Pan Pacific 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old West German, the world's top-ranked women's player, needed only 
51 minutes to beat Savchenko, ranked 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
"I had expected a much harder match because she is really a tough player," Graf 
said. "On this surface it could have been a much closer match because she 
usually has a big serve. But she made simple mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Graf meets Manuela Maleeva of Switzerland in the semifinals.

Maleeva, ranked eighth in the world, beat big-serving Brenda Schultz of The

ANGELS: PITCHER COMES TO TERMS JUST BEFORE ARBITRATION HEARING. MINTON DECLARES 
HIMSELF A FREE AGENT. 
</P>

<P>
Relief pitcher Bob McClure agreed to a one-year contract Friday, moments before 
his arbitration hearing, paring a seventh name off the list of 12 Angels who 
had filed for arbitration last month. 
</P>
<P>
McClure, 6-1 last season with a 1.55 earned-run average, will be paid $825,000 
in 1990, closer to the $880,000 figure he filed than the $650,000 figure the 
Angels had filed. The contract contains no incentive clauses. McClure was paid 
$200,000 last season plus $275,000 in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
McClure's agent, Alan Meersand, said he made the decisive overture to Dan 
O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president, Friday after the parties had 
entered the hearing room at a Los Angeles hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Meersand said he and his client decided they had more to lose than gain by 
going through the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at what you have in hand," he said. "You have 825 (thousand 
dollars), then you go to the hearing and you only stand to make 55 more. You 
stand to lose 175 from where we were at 825 if the arbitrator gives you 600. 
Bob didn't want to take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers McClure, Chuck Finley, Willie Fraser and Mike Witt, catcher Bill 
Schroeder and outfielder Max Venable agreed to contracts before going to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Still scheduled for hearings are first baseman Wally Joyner, whose case is due 
to be heard Monday in Los Angeles; center fielder Devon White, Tuesday in Los 
Angeles; pitcher Scott Bailes, Friday in Chicago; pitcher Kirk McCaskill, Feb. 
19 in Chicago, and third baseman Jack Howell, Feb. 20 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Greg Minton also filed but was told by the Angels that they would not 
go to arbitration with him. He declared himself a free agent Friday. Minton, 
who last season earned a base salary of $630,000 plus $100,000 in bonuses, had 
filed for arbitration at $1,150,000. The Angels had filed at $780,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old right-hander was 4-3 with a 2.20 ERA and eight saves in 62 
games last season, but he became expendable after the acquisition of Mike 
Smithson and Bailes and Fraser's development as the right-handed setup man. 
Minton cannot sign with the Angels again until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels said that right-hander Mark Clear, 33, who missed last season after 
surgery to repair a ligament in his right elbow, agreed to a one-year contract. 
His salary will be minimal, but could be boosted by incentive clauses. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also signed infielder Gary Disarcina, who played most of last season 
with double-A Midland. In 126 games, he hit .286 with 54 runs batted in.

MEXICO'S FANS COME OUT CHEERING; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIS CUP: SMALL CONTINGENT DROWNS OUT THE THOUSANDS OF U.S. ROOTERS.

Alfonso Aldrete got off work Thursday afternoon in his hometown of Hermosillo, 
Mexico, drove all night, and arrived here Friday just in time for the opening 
of the Davis Cup matches between the U.S. and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, he knew long before his nine-hour drive that Mexico had practically no 
chance of knocking off the U.S. team but his countrymen needed his support, 
didn't they? 
</P>
<P>
So there he was Friday, along with what he estimated to be about 100 or so 
other fans from Baja California, cheering and screaming so loudly that they 
were drowning out the thousands of U.S. fans at the La Costa Resort Hotel and 
Spa. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not like the Super Bowl or soccer, no," Aldrete said. "But in our 
country, it is very, very big." 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, their moral support did little good. Mexico lost both of Friday's 
singles matches in the first round, which means that the doubles team of Rick 
Leach and Jim Pugh can clinch a second-round berth for the U.S. with a victory 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to believe in miracles," Aldrete said, shaking his head. "I'm 
afraid we don't have a very good team right now." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, you can't blame Aldrete and the Mexican fans for having had a glimmer 
of hope. Things looked promising for them when Jorge Lozano took the first set 
from Jay Berger in the opening singles match, and was leading 4-1 in the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
You should have seen them. 
</P>
<P>
There was Salvador Villanueva running laps around the stadium, carrying a 
Mexican flag. Juan Manuel Moncillas, also from Hermosillo, was yelling, 
"Arribe! Arribe!" after each point won by Lozano. And all of a sudden, U.S. 
fans were feeling quite uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those rooting for the U.S. might have been feeling that way even if 
Berger had not lost a point, considering the architectural gaffe of La Costa's 
stands that leaves precious few seats with unobstructed views. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely ridiculous," said Gail Forbes of La Jolla. "I can't believe 
I paid $40 apiece for these, and I can't see half of the court. I've moved 
around a few times, and the way I figure it, there's about $78,000 worth of 
seats that aren't worth a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete and his buddies solved part of that problem by standing throughout the 
matches, but as the U.S. slowly began to dominate, there was less and less that 
the Mexican fans wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
"If we won, we were going to go crazy," Aldrete said. "But if we lost, we said 
we'd drink a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I feel so bad that I lost," said Lozano, 26, a three-time 
All-American at USC. "It means a lot to my country. The Davis Cup is very 
important to us. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good match. But I didn't come here to play a good match. I came here 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was a letdown for everybody that was pulling for Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there might not have been a lot of Mexican fans, but, oh, how they were 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
Said Berger: "The Latin attitude is a very happy attitude. Let's scream. Let's 
dance. Let's shout. That's the way it is. That's the way they were brought up." 
</P>
<P>
That's not exactly the kind of comment that will land Berger a job in foreign 
relations, but you can just imagine his appreciation for not experiencing the 
kind of atmosphere had he lost.

<P>
Costa Rica, another World Cup qualifier but hardly a world power, scored in the 
ninth minute and was virtually unchallenged for the remainder of the game in a 
2-0 victory before a crowd of about 20,000 in the first round of the Marlboro 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
That relegates the United States to the third-place game Sunday afternoon 
against Colombia, which lost to Uruguay, 2-0. That was the second game Friday 
night, when the crowd grew to 25,392 as additional fans came to watch the more 
exciting and skillful South American style of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, which scored both goals in the final 13 minutes, will meet Costa Rica 
Sunday night for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
In comments to his players after the game, U.S. Coach Bob Gansler lectured them 
about their lack of effort. But he told reporters later that he did not expect 
much more from the players than they gave him considering that they had not 
played a game since Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that our players needed some time off, and now we're starting to build 
them up again," he said. "We didn't look good, but it's more a matter of 
fitness and timing than it is ability. This is our first preseason game." 
</P>
<P>
But the players did not let themselves off so easily. They beat themselves up 
after the game as badly as Costa Rica did during it. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach made it plain and simple," said goalkeeper Tony Meola, who allowed 
no goals in his four World Cup qualifying games last year. "We didn't have a 
hell of a lot of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
The most critical player was Hugo Perez, usually a midfielder but a forward in 
this game as Gansler experimented with his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said some of the U.S. players were too impressed with themselves after 
qualifying for the World Cup from the North and Central American and Caribbean 
region (CONCACAF). Costa Rica, which split two games with the United States 
last year, is the other qualifier from that region. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done anything; we're nothing," he said. "We qualified from 
CONCACAF, the worst region in the World Cup. The trouble is we think we're 
superstars. We've got to play more as a team."

The sellout crowd of 16,428 rose as one when Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland strode 
to the starting line to run in the Wanamaker Mile at the 83rd Millrose Games 
Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"The ovation from the crowd was a wonderful feeling," Coghlan said. "I was 
hoping that it would lift my adrenalin beyond any level it has been since I 
last ran in this race three years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But age has robbed Coghlan, 37, of the finishing kick that enabled him to 
become the world record holder in the indoor mile. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland won in 3 minutes 59.35 seconds, his third 
consecutive Wanamaker Mile victory. Coghlan finished fifth in 4:01.83. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was youth over age, and Marcus had more in his legs than I did in 
mine," Coghlan said. "Perhaps I was a little bit more ambitious than my 
ability. But I still feel I can run a sub-four minute mile at this stage of my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Coghlan, known as the Chairman of the Boards after winning the Wanamaker Mile 
seven times, was boxed in and couldn't fight his way out. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the race there were a number of times where it turned out to be a 
boxing match," Coghlan said. "That disrupted my concentration a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan maintained his concentration throughout the race, turning in 
quarter-mile splits of 59.8 seconds, 62.4, 60.9 and 56.1. 
</P>
<P>
Why is O'Sullivan running so well? 
</P>
<P>
"Because he's an Irishman like me," Coghlan quipped. "Perhaps what inspires 
Marcus is the fact that I've achieved what I've achieved indoors. In Ireland we 
have heros to look up to. I think that young kids in the United States don't 
have enough heros to look up to." 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan said Coghlan's presence in the race inspired him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been finding it really hard to get up this winter," O'Sullivan said. 
"Psychologically, I think I overworked myself last summer. I didn't feel as 
committed as I did in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I heard that (Coghlan had decided to switch from the 3,000 meters 
to the mile), my blood started flowing. It was a nice feeling to have him in 
the race because it got my motivation going." 
</P>
<P>
The 55-meter high hurdles, which featured seven of the top 10 hurdlers in the 
world, developed into a race of attrition before former UCLA star Greg Foster 
prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kingdom, two-time Olympic 110-meter high hurdles champion, failed to 
qualify for the finals after he finished third in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kingdom was unable to train because of a bout with the flu, he refused 
to use his illness as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to blame it on anything," Kingdom said. "I just ran bad. My time 
was off because of not working out in a while because of the flu. But you have 
to overcome those things and fight back from all adversity." 
</P>
<P>
Renaldo Nehemiah, the world indoor record-holder, made the final but tripped 
over the first hurdle and failed to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I got severe cramps the third or fourth stride out," Nehemiah said. "I kept 
trying to run through it, but it got progressively worse. I knew it would take 
an act of God for me to get over that first hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic and world champion in the long jump and 
heptathlon, didn't fare as well as she might have either. 
</P>
<P>
Making her 1990 indoor debut, Joyner-Kersee finished second in the women's 
55-meter hurdles behind former Tennessee star LaVonna Martin. Martin (7.41) 
outkicked Joyner-Kersee (7.47). 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee said she lost sight of Martin because she was focused on beating 
Kim McKenzie and Lynda Tolbert. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed, it's a long season," Joyner-Kersee said. "Last year I 
ran fast early, but this year I want to be ready for June and July." 
</P>
<P>
The men's 600 meters was the closest race of the meet as Butch Reynolds edged 
Danny Harris in a photo finish. Reynolds was timed in 1:09.22 and Harris in 
1:09.27. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High won the boys' high school mile with a time of 
4:14.52, beating Martin Keino of Fork Union, Va. (4.16.63). Keino's father Kip, 
a two-time Olympic gold medalist from Kenya, finished last in the masters mile 
with a time of 5:05.04. It was the first time that a father and son had run in 
the Millrose Games. . . . Leroy Burrell of Houston set a meet record of 6.11 
seconds in the men's 55-meter dash. Burrell said he has benefited from training 
with Carl Lewis. "Training with Carl is almost like having an instant success 
pill," Burrell said. . . . Doug Padilla won the 3,000 in a meet record time of 
7:44.74 and Tyrone Kemp of Florida also set a meet record of 46.85 seconds in 
the 400.

SITZMARK'S 'PEBBLE STARS' SET TO SAIL; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: HINCKLEY'S BOAT IS SHORT ON SIZE, BUT THE CREW IS LONG ON KNOW-HOW FOR 
THE 1,100-MILE RACE TO MANZANILLO, MEXICO. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the bigger yachts leaving Point Loma today for the 1,100-mile 
pilgrimage to Manzanillo, Mexico, will be run by professional yachtsmen -- 
sometimes called "rock stars" or Dennis Conners. Many of these boats will use 
computers, sea-temperature instruments and extravagant weather devices. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the smaller boats, such as the 41-foot Sitzmark, will be run with 
more simple methods. 
</P>
<P>
"All of that stuff is pretty theoretical," said Ward Hinckley, Sitzmark's 
skipper. "Most of what you do is by the seat of your pants. A lot of this race 
is being where the wind is. Which is why the navigator is so important." 
</P>
<P>
The navigator for Sitzmark is Mike Benedict, a veteran of six San 
Diego-to-Manzanillo races. Hinckley affectionately calls his crew "pebble 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any professional racers, people whose whole life is built around 
their racing boat," said Hinckley, a member of the Coronado Cays Yacht Club. 
"Mike Benedict is about as close as we come to having a rock star." 
</P>
<P>
Benedict, 46, navigated 41-foot Encore, which won this race in 1986, but admits 
there is a little bit of luck involved. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is being in the right place at the right time," Benedict said. 
"But since I've done this so many times, I am aware of certain places to be at 
certain times of the day. You have to put yourself in that right place in order 
to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said he likes his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"With our crew, I don't think we'll make too many fundamental mistakes, so we 
should have a pretty good chance of winning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all going to make mistakes. We're going to make wrong tactical 
decisions. Nobody has ever sailed the perfect race. But nobody is going to get 
excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
When the pebble stars do err, they can later discuss it over cocktails. The 
eight-member Sitzmark crew will have a happy hour and a music appreciation hour 
every night at five. During that time, they will discuss future tactics and 
past blunders with either one beer or one glass of wine -- their daily ration. 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said his crew, which has never sailed together before this race, was 
more than willing to ration alcohol for less weight and a better opportunity to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very congenial crew," Hinckley said. "You're together for a week or 
more in confining conditions, you better be reasonably compatible, or it's not 
going to be a pleasant trip for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Hinckley, Ward's wife, said she has heard about crews where conflicting 
personalities have limited effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen in some boats where there gets to be a real bitterness, and 
people get to yelling at each other," she said. "People like to sail with us, 
generally because we have a very quiet boat." 
</P>
<P>
The Sitzmark, only 1 1/2 years old, has entered the race in two classes -- 
IOR-B (International Offshore Racing Assn.) and IMS (International Measuring 
System). Both classes are based on the boat's dimensions. A boat is given a 
rating or an elapsed-time handicap for its dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict and Hinckley agree their odds of winning are considerably better in 
IMS, where they will be matched against six similar boats. 
</P>
<P>
Yachts entered in the IMS class, which will be contested for the first time in 
the Manzanillo race, will have dining tables in the front and back cabins. 
</P>
<P>
"This class was designed for people who want to go to Catalina (Island) but 
still race occasionally," Hinckley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ward and Dorothy Hinckley are more than the occasional racers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, they have competed 42 times -- taking first place in the PHRF 
(Performance Handicapped Racing Federation) Class A Cabrillo race and tying for 
first in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cabrillo race and most of the other regattas the Hinckleys enter are 
about 50 miles long, a far cry from 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
So why, at the age of 63, has Hinckley decided to sail all the way to 
Manzanillo? 
</P>
<P>
For Hinckley, a major attraction is Las Hadas, a resort in the town, which lies 
about 400 miles south of Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the regatta) was going anywhere else than Las Hadas, I don't think we'd 
go," Hinckley said. "It's just a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dorothy Hinckley, "There's nothing like it on the Mexican coast. You feel 
like you're in another world." 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said his age is another reason he entered the race, held every two 
years. "When you get to be my age, you better do it quickly, or it's going to 
pass you by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Gladstone, who is a friend of Hinckley but will sail for the Kathmandu 
crew, said Manzanillo is different from most regattas because of the scenery 
and the course's unpredictable weather. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see a lot of humpback and killer whales, and the dolphins will swim 
right in front of the bow and play with you," said Gladstone, a veteran of two 
Manzanillo races. "Every point of land is a potential parking lot (dead wind 
area). "Once, we spent half-a-day trying to get out from the Cabo San Lucas 
because there were no winds." 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said the conditions are usually calm on the way to Cabo. 
</P>
<P>
"In normal conditions, from here to Cabo, I'd be surprised if we had to change 
sails five or six times," Hinckley said. "The last quarter of the way is where 
we'll have to make adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Before Cabo San Lucas, Benedict said many of the boats will be tacking out to 
sea in search of kinder winds, which means most of the 26 boats entered will 
travel farther than 1,100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger boats will be able to take the longer tacks out to sea," Benedict 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A smaller boat like us might not be able to make up the distance and the time 
if we get too far out. So even though this is a long race, you could wind up 
doing something really stupid, and no matter what you did, you could never make 
it up."

KEARNY WINS; NO. 1 MT. CARMEL UPSET

<P>
The scoreboard is ancient. The lights are dim. The air seems stale. The only 
thing missing in Kearny's gym is a "Trespassers will be prosecuted," sign. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting USDHS escaped a jail sentence Friday night but couldn't escape a 
Kearny team that believes that there's no place like home, losing, 90-79, in a 
key City Western League boys' basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can lose here," said Kearny junior Mike Oviedo, who finished 
with a game-high 27 points, his best this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny's only loss at home this year was early in the season to Serra. The 
Komets (14-8, 2-3) may be a bit superstitious about this thing, but in their 
first four league games, three of which were on the road, they went 1-3. Their 
only victory was at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of our last four games are at home," Kearny Coach Bill Peterson said. 
"If (USDHS) can beat University City at home, it's a whole new race." 
</P>
<P>
University City (5-0) is still favored to win the league, but USDHS (11-6, 3-2) 
will play in the same division (III) as Kearny come playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping this will help us for the rest of the season," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny played more of an up-tempo game than it is accustomed to and was able to 
hold USDHS's leading scorer, Peter Ellis, to 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," USDHS Coach Jim Tomey said. "We played their style when they 
played us at home, and they played our style when we came here." 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny held a 32-29 halftime lead and extended it to 12 points midway through 
the third quarter. The Dons reeled Kearny back in and even took a 47-46 lead 
early in the fourth, but the Komets put on a free throw exhibition by hitting 
25 of 28 in the last period. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Rawlins made 14 of 15. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over to me and said, 'This is like putting money in the bank,' then he 
missed the next one," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomey was impressed by Rawlins, who scored 21 of his 25 points in the fourth 
quarter, but he was more in awe of Kearny's victory, given its skeletal roster. 
Only eight players suited up, and two didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real team effort," Peterson said. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

FIRMS DUMP TOXICS SUIT ON CITIES, COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A CONSORTIUM OF MAJOR CORPORATIONS SEEKS TO SPREAD THE BLAME FOR 
THE SHUTDOWN OF A MONTEREY PARK DUMP. IT WANTS HELP IN PAYING THE CLEANUP BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In what may be a landmark lawsuit, 29 cities in Los Angeles County have been 
sued by a consortium of high-powered corporations in an attempt to spread the 
blame for the lingering toxic contamination that closed a major Monterey Park 
dump site six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, a virtual Who's Who of corporate America, already have been 
blamed by federal officials for the contamination, and have agreed under a 
previous federal court settlement to help finance multimillion-dollar cleanup 
efforts at the Operating Industries Inc. dump. 
</P>
<P>
But now the corporations, in a novel approach to toxics litigation, are trying 
to get the cities to pay part of the bill as well. The cities named in the 
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles late last year range from 
Beverly Hills and San Marino to Cudahy and Walnut. Also named are the County of 
Los Angeles and the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The suit argues that the municipalities, Caltrans and the county are partly 
responsible for the contamination because they dumped toxics there themselves, 
or hired companies to do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to establish a pollution trail is likely to be a landmark case, 
regardless of its outcome, federal environmental officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual," said Lisa A. Haage, an attorney with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson added, "It raises a lot of liability questions and 
ones of chain reactions." 
</P>
<P>
A number of the corporations face clean-up claims at other landfills as well. 
If their suit regarding the Monterey Park dump succeeds, comparable claims may 
be made at similar sites elsewhere, legal and environmental experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,200 Superfund sites across the country, more than 200 are large, 
municipal landfills such as the one in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The issue in the litigation is fairness, said David Giannotti, the Los Angeles 
attorney representing the corporations, including Fortune 500 firms such as 
Chevron, Exxon, General Motors, Hughes Aircraft, Texaco, TRW and Xerox. "All 
parties responsible should contribute their fair share," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Operating Industries Inc. landfill started as a sand and gravel pit on 
Monterey Park's southern edge. During nearly four decades after World War II, 
it grew from a local dump into a regional one. In addition to the garbage and 
trash buried there, oil companies, food processing firms, aerospace industries 
and waste haulers dumped a variety of hazardous liquids, in cluding such 
potentially cancer-causing substances as vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, 
benzene and toluene at the site. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, in response to years of public outcry, environmental and health 
officials ordered it closed. By then, a mountain of smelly trash extended over 
190 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities deny transporting waste to the dump. Others maintain their records 
on the subject are long lost, or never existed. Still others acknowledge that 
their trash may have been trucked there, but say it was non-hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
The suit does not ask for a specific amount of money damages. Federal officials 
estimate the cleanup costs will run into hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Scher, Monterey Park's assistant city attorney, said an unfavorable 
ruling against the cities could bankrupt them. "I don't know what (the 
corporations) are aiming at, presumably to bring in insurance companies and get 
as much money from cities as they can. But they won't get much. Every city I 
know is operating on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Giannotti, however, said the cities would not be greatly burdened 
because "most cities may potentially have insurance." But officials in many of 
the cities dispute this, saying their municipal liability insurance policies do 
not cover pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Maywood's Chief Administrative Officer, Leonard Locher, said the suit is 
puzzling to his community of 24,611 residents. Maywood lies about five miles 
southwest from the former dump site. "We knew about the landfill," he said, 
without saying his city had dumped there, "but we had no idea we'd be sued. 
Surprise! Twenty years later, we get sued." 
</P>
<P>
The landfill has been ranked as one of the worst toxic dumps in the nation and 
is one of four federal Superfund sites in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the emphasis in cleaning up such sites has been on tracking down 
corporate polluters. Last year, as part of a federal court settlement with the 
EPA, more than 110 companies agreed to finance the cleanup at the Monterey Park 
dump, although they admitted no liability. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of settlement, the corporations divided into two groups. About half 
of the companies, including the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Coca-Cola Co., 
and Times Mirror Co., the Los Angeles Times' parent firm, agreed to make 
combined cash payments of $31 million. Most of those companies are not suing 
the cities. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the companies banded together and agreed to pay for a longer-term 
solution, spending up to $34 million to oversee the cleanup, which EPA 
officials estimate could take 45 to 60 years. This second group of companies, 
joined by a few of the others, filed suit against the cities. 
</P>
<P>
And the EPA, still on the lookout for more corporate polluters to fund the 
cleanup, is scouring records that show that more than 4,000 companies may have 
dumped waste at the site. But the agency did not choose to go after the cities 
because it does not consider them to blame for the problem, Haage said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the corporations' suit has been filed, the defendants have not yet 
been formally notified. The deadline for that is April. Meanwhile, the 
companies are pushing for an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the defendants claim the corporations' charges are unreasonable, 
they are taking the lawsuit and its possible ramifications seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me it's kind of a novel lawsuit, but we have to take it seriously. 
These are big corporations," said David Kelsey, chief of the county counsel's 
public works division. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Nowak of San Marino said records indicate that his city may 
have sent only one load of concrete rubbish to the dump. "We're a little 
dismayed that the Fortune 500 companies would make such an attempt. We're going 
to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND Before the 190-acre Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey 
Park was closed in 1984, oil companies, food processing firms, the aerospace 
industry and waste haulers had dumped a wide range of hazardous liquids there, 
including such potentially cancer-causing substances as vinyl chloride, 
trichloroethylene, benzene and toluene. Although a 1988 federal study praised 
the cleanup efforts at the western San Gabriel Valley dump, a top federal 
environmental administrator nevertheless describes it as "one of the most 
complex and contaminated sites in the nation." The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's latest remedy calls for placing an elaborate plastic cover 
over much of the site, combined with a system to dump out hazardous wastes.

UNIFORMED PUPILS MAY BE TREND-SETTERS

In a move prompted by parents who want to protect their children from gang 
members, pupils at Vaughn Street Elementary School in Pacoima on Friday became 
the first public school children in Los Angeles to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"This way they won't get confused with gang members and get shot," said Ernesto 
Rojas, as he walked his uniform-clad daughter Karina, 8, to school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread interest in the optional uniform program by parents in other parts 
of the city suggests that more schools may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Although only about 10% of Vaughn's 1,000 students wore the maroon-and-gray 
ensemble selected by a parents group, more than 100 have signed up for a 
lottery to receive free uniforms through an anonymous $5,000 donation. 
</P>
<P>
Parents voted for the uniform option in November to protect children from being 
mistaken for gang members if they inadvertently wear colors associated with 
gangs, such as red or blue. Vaughn Street School is on the edge of Pacoima in a 
neighborhood known for violent turf battles with rival San Fernando gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school children are increasingly imitating the garb of older gang 
members, said Vaughn Principal Emma Wilson. She said a parent awareness class 
taught by Community Youth Gang Services last summer made parents aware of this 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as far down as kindergarten, first grade," said Vaughn parent Hilda 
Ochoa, who helped lead the uniform crusade. "There's a gang around here that 
wears the black Raiders jacket and you see little kids wearing those." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said she first became concerned last year when her children reported 
being shoved around by older youngsters on days when they wore the school color 
-- red -- which is associated with factions of the Bloods gang. School 
officials changed the color to blue, but blue is the color associated with 
Crips gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Now the official school colors are maroon and gray, like the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
After widespread news reports of the November vote, Ochoa said she was 
contacted by parents from several other schools -- including Sylmar Elementary 
School and El Rincon Elementary in Culver City. Wilson, who said she has heard 
from several more, added that the uniform idea pleases parents from Mexico and 
Central America -- the homelands of most Vaughn parents -- because uniforms are 
common at public schools in their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Watzman of Sherman Oaks, whose son attends an Encino junior high school, 
said she has contacted Kids Limited, the firm that supplies Vaughn's uniforms. 
She said she plans to raise the idea at a future parents meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"My son knows which students are gang members or want-to-be gang members," 
Watzman said. "With uniforms, you wouldn't have the young student trying to 
look like the gang member." 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, most parents dropping off uniform-clad children at Vaughn Street 
School cited a practical reason for making the $50 to $75 expenditure: a less 
complicated morning dressing ritual and less clothing competition at school. 
</P>
<P>
"There's none of this crying in the morning about, 'What am I going to wear?' 
and 'I don't want to wear that,"' parent Carmel Equihua said in Spanish. "They 
look more presentable." 
</P>
<P>
Equihua bought matching plaid material for hair bows and folder covers for her 
two daughters, Janet, 7, and Johanna, 9. Johanna said it took her just minutes 
to get ready for school Friday morning, instead of the normal half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's pretty," she said, eyeing her plaid jumper. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the uniforms got better reviews from girls than from boys. 
</P>
<P>
Third-grader Jose Rodriguez topped his uniform with a leather jacket and 
slicked-back hair. He said he would rather be wearing leather pants or jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of OK, but it's not my style," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Jose Rezendez, 10, wore a hooded sweat shirt and faded orange jeans 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want it. I don't like it," he said of the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to lift peer pressure to dress in expensive, name-brand clothes is 
not completely solved by uniforms, parents said, because some students who 
could not afford the trendy clothes also cannot afford the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
One first grader, when asked why she was not wearing a uniform, cast her eyes 
to the ground. "Because my dad doesn't have much money," she said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that at least 100 parents have signed up to be part of a lottery 
that will determine which students receive free uniforms through a $5,000 
donation, made anonymously earlier this year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLEMAN SUES HIS MOTHER FOR MALICIOUS 
PROSECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Gary Coleman filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit Friday in Los Angeles 
against his mother, two days after a judge turned down her attempt to have a 
conservator appointed to take control of his affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, former star of the television sitcom "Diff'rent Strokes," claims 
Edmonia Sue Coleman knew the claims she made in the conservatorship petition -- 
that her son's nearly $7-million estate was being mismanaged and the actor's 
kidney condition was not being properly treated -- were false when the court 
papers were filed in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Coleman's suit claims his mother sought a trustee for him in retaliation 
for a separate lawsuit he filed last June against her and others, accusing them 
of misappropriating $1 million from his estate from 1985 to 1988. Gary 
Coleman's new suit asks for $25,000 in damages.

PLAYWRIGHT APPEALS TO GORBACHEV ON ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent Soviet playwright visiting Los Angeles has issued a plea to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to condemn a rising tide of anti-Semitism in the 
Soviet Union before it erupts into widespread violence. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandr Buravsky, a liberal supporter of Gorbachev, said that an increasing 
number of overtly anti-Semitic publications, articles and demonstrations -- 
coupled with threats to stage pogroms against Jews in Moscow on May 5 and a 
recent disruption of a Moscow writers' meeting by anti-Semites -- make it 
imperative that Gorbachev put his personal prestige on the line against 
anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my appeal to Gorbachev: Act according to (the) Constitution, but act," 
Buravsky said. "This chauvinistic propaganda -- it is his obligation to stop 
it. Now, nobody has stopped it and people really feel panic." The Soviet 
Constitution prohibits fostering ethnic hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Buravsky, who had six hit theater productions in Moscow and four movies in the 
last 3 1/2 years, is in Los Angeles in connection with his latest play, "The 
Russian Teacher," which had a reading Jan. 22 at the South Coast Repertory 
theater in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is addressing his plea to Gorbachev not only because of the urgency 
of the situation, but also to raise American public opinion, which he said is 
influential in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't wait for a fire. We should try to prevent (it), if you can smell 
the smoke," he said in an interview at the home of a Los Angeles friend. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old playwright, a lanky, soft-spoken man, has considerable 
political stature in a country where, until recently, the theater has been a 
major avenue for dealing with themes too controversial to address directly. He 
became famous in 1986 as author of "Speak Out!," which created a sensation as 
the first play produced in Moscow that criticized Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Buravsky said the recent rise in anti-Semitism, which has a long history in the 
Soviet Union, is not merely a grass-roots phenomenon, nor is it limited to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
His statement is supported by a speech in December at the newly created Soviet 
Congress of Jewish Organizations, where anti-Semitic demonstrators shouted 
slurs at delegates. The speech reported more than 50 desecrations of Jewish 
cemeteries and hundreds of anti-Semitic rallies in recent months, according to 
one account. 
</P>
<P>
At the highest levels, Buravsky charged, anti-Semitism has received veiled 
backing from the most conservative members of the Politburo, Yegor K. Ligachev 
and Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov, whom he claimed signaled their support in 
published interviews in which they praised lists of writers made up solely of 
anti-Semites. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that anti-Semitism is tolerated or receives support at lower 
official levels. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington or at the 
Consulate in San Francisco were unsuccessful on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Buravsky said that police, who regularly cordon off pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Moscow's Pushkin Square, do not interfere with frequent 
demonstrations by the openly anti-Semitic organization Pamyat (Memory), he 
said. In fact, he added, the organization several months ago held a 
demonstration in Red Square, which is reserved for official ceremonies and 
where public conduct is strictly regulated. 
</P>
<P>
A number of publications recently have been taken over by editors who publish 
anti-Semitic tracts, he said, pointing to several recent articles in the 
journal Our Contemporary, including one in the June issue that identified 
Soviet Jews as a "small nation" preying on the "large nation." According to 
Buravsky, other anti-Semitic themes range from the proposition that Jews 
controlled Stalin and his murderous excesses to blaming Jews for Gorbachev's 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Leaflets by the thousands have recently been distributed in Moscow calling for 
violence against Jews on May 5, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buravsky said he frequently gets letters attacking him as a Jew, and he added 
that making a plea to Gorbachev in Los Angeles to act against anti-Semitism is 
likely to make him more of a target. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I can have some troubles with this interview when I come back to 
Moscow, but it is my obligation to do something," he said. "Many people in the 
Soviet Union look at America."

UCLA WOMEN GET THREATS IN AFTERMATH OF ALLEGED RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three UCLA women who published letters in the student newspaper supporting a 
student who allegedly was raped at a fraternity house have themselves become 
targets of threats. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, which appeared earlier this week in the Viewpoint opinion section 
of the Daily Bruin, were written in response to an anonymous letter in which a 
woman student said she had been raped by two fraternity members during a frat 
house party last April. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said one of the men plied her with drinks of "tasty pink punch" until 
she was too unsteady to fight him off. After raping her, he brought along a 
fellow fraternity member to join in the assault, she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The letter writer, who did not name the fraternity, said fear and shame had 
stopped her from reporting the alleged rapes to authorities. Besides, she said, 
she would not be able to provide enough proof to convict her attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after the woman's account ran in the Daily Bruin, the newspaper 
published signed letters from students who expressed support for the woman and 
outrage at the alleged rape. That night, three women students whose letters had 
appeared found threatening messages left on their answering machines. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous male voice identified himself as a fraternity member, told the 
women they were "screwed in the head" and invited them to attend a fraternity 
party so "I can teach you a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was very frightened," said Eileen Hunt, 20, a junior English major 
who received one of the messages. "But after you calm down, then you are angry. 
Now, I'm almost laughing at him. . . . It was a lunatic thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to the Daily Bruin, Hunt had said the woman's account of alleged 
rape made her cry, and she implored the woman to "Please fight. Please." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dooley, 36, a graduate student in public health, was both angered and 
alarmed by the call on her answering machine, an invasion she compared to the 
act of rape. In her letter, she had offered to stage a candlelight vigil 
outside the fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
The third woman, Elizabeth Larson, 21, a senior Russian studies major, reported 
the call, which she labeled "cowardly," to campus police on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, who had advocated castration of rapists in her letter, said her 
boyfriend responded to the threat by changing the greeting on her answering 
machine: "All whining frat boys calling this number will please be asked to 
have enough courage and manliness to leave their names and numbers and geek 
affiliation." 
</P>
<P>
Student and faculty advisers to UCLA's estimated 60 fraternities and sororities 
said they had not received a formal complaint about the alleged rape or the 
phoned threats but would investigate the matters if they did. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Fishburn, director of the university's fraternity and sorority relations 
department, said the person who made the calls is a "misguided man" -- but not 
necessarily a fraternity man. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know there are a good many nuts out there in the woodwork," she said. 
"This could be anybody. We have no way of knowing." 
</P>
<P>
Added Gary Hobart, president of UCLA's Interfraternity Council: "If it (the 
rape) did occur, we definitely feel sympathy (for the alleged victim) and would 
ask that the evidence be brought to the criminal justice system."

LEVITATED COMMUTER LINE PROPOSED FOR SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

CORONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese firm told state legislators Friday that it is willing to pay for a 
$30-million-per-mile, magnetically levitated commuter rail line linking 
downtown Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando Valley in exchange for 
rights of way along the freeways and an exclusive operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Eiji Ikeda of the Japanese HSST Corp. told a joint hearing of 
the Senate Transportation and Appropriations committees here that a five-mile 
demonstration project on the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County could operate 
within 18 months of approval. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sleek, aerodynamic trains would resemble a demonstration model used 
at Expo '86 in Vancouver, Canada. Running along freeway routes, it ultimately 
could move millions of commuters each year to urban centers and both Los 
Angeles International and John Wayne Airports. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda acknowledged that though his and other foreign firms have developed 
magnetically levitated commuter trains, none is operating yet except on test 
tracks or at exhibitions. State and federal officials reacted cautiously to the 
proposal, expressing doubt the system was economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on whether financing would be available for a full, 155.6-mile loop 
around Southern California, Ikeda said, "Money is very much available in Japan, 
especially right now." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ikeda said that fares on a completed Southern California system would 
be less than what Amtrak currently charges for traveling similar distances, 
such as the $9 one-way ticket price between Santa Ana and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said his firm wants to build the five-mile demonstration link from Santa 
Ana to Anaheim to "show everyone that it works." 
</P>
<P>
He added that his firm needs assurances from the state that the environmental 
clearance process would be speeded up -- but not waived -- and would need 
Caltrans' donation of rights-of-way along the Santa Ana, Golden State and San 
Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Where medians are not available, Ikeda said, the trains could use freeway 
shoulders and air space above freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
It was environmental concerns, in large part, that doomed a 1981 proposal for a 
steel-wheeled, high-speed Bullet Train from Los Angeles to San Diego. The HSST 
train is "free of air and noise pollution, aesthetically pleasing, economical, 
reliable, safe, requires less energy consumption than other systems," Ikeda 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese proposal surprised the two senators in attendance at Friday's 
hearing -- Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, and Reuben Ayala (D-Chino), a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
After joking with Ikeda about how fast he might be able to build a system, 
Presley said: "It's good to learn that this technology is available to draw 
on." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Presley supported the concept of a five-mile demonstration 
project and called HSST's technology "far advanced." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the firm's request for speedy environmental clearances would 
be difficult to grant, though he noted such provisions have been made for 
construction of state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's plausible to work it out," said Caltrans' Assistant Director Warren 
Weber. "But I'm not sure they (HSST Corp.) have studied carefully enough all of 
the bridges and overpasses that might have to be reconstructed to accommodate 
their train system." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Scolaro, Amtrak's chief administrator for government affairs, said he did 
not fully understand Ikeda's presentation but found it "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't talk about how much money it's going to take to operate the system 
after it's built," Scolaro said. "I think there's a place for both (Amtrak and 
a commuter system). I just don't know if he (Ikeda) can pull it off. It's going 
to be awfully difficult. It's going to cost an awful lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
HSST Corp. currently is bidding against other companies, including a German 
firm, for a $100-million, five-mile commuter rail project in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ikeda said he sees his firm competing with others for construction of 
a six-city monorail system that has been proposed for central Orange County.

COUNCIL GIVES $350,000 TO TROUBLED THEATRE CENTRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to give another $350,000 
to the financially troubled Los Angeles Theatre Centre, but asked for a 
five-year plan detailing the theater's economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members had expressed increasing concern over the amount of 
money spent on the center -- more than $19 million over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they voted to approve the latest grant after receiving reports 
that showed dramatic improvements in the center's financial management. 
</P>
<P>
The $350,000 will come from the budget of Community Redevelopment Agency, which 
partially funds the theater as part of its effort to revitalize the central 
business district. The CRA agreed last June to seek council approval for the 
expenditure if the theater reduced its debt from $1.04 million to $500,000 by 
the end of 1989. A successful fund-raising drive last December, as well as 
cost-saving and other measures, brought the debt down to $494,000. 
</P>
<P>
E. Kent Damon Jr., president of the center's board of directors, said the vote 
indicated "strong support on the council." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a full airing of our financial position," Damon said, 
adding: "We've been on a strong growth track in terms of our finances in the 
last two years." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his vote for the center, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky voiced strong 
objections to spending additional city money. Yaroslavsky agreed to support the 
proposal only after asking the theater to provide future financial data. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not about whether you're for the arts or not," Yaroslavsky said. "What 
this is about, however, is an incredible amount of expenditure." A total of 
$1.8 million in CRA money will be spent on the theater in the current fiscal 
year alone, Yaroslavsky said.

ANTI-ABORTION GROUP'S LAWYER GETS JAIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyer Cyrus Zal was sentenced Friday to 90 days in jail and ordered to pay a 
$10,000 fine for repeatedly ignoring a judge's orders not to discuss abortion 
at a recent trial in which Zal represented six anti-abortion activists 
convicted of trespass. 
</P>
<P>
At a lengthy hearing before he sentenced Zal for contempt of court, El Cajon 
Municipal Court Judge Larrie R. Brainard Jr. also sent one of Zal's six 
clients, James Holman, 43, the publisher of the Reader, a San Diego weekly 
newspaper, to jail for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, 42, a Folsom-based lawyer dispatched to the El Cajon court by the 
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, said he planned an immediate appeal of 
Brainard's order to the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Zal, cited 20 times for contempt, to report to the downtown 
San Diego County Jail late Monday afternoon to begin serving the sentence. 
However, Brainard gave him until then to try to persuade the 4th District court 
that it should delay the imposition of sentence while he wages his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard hit Zal with the contempt citations each time the lawyer ignored his 
order not to discuss abortion. The judge condemned the "self-righteous 
arrogance of (the protesters) and Mr. Zal" at Friday's hearing, saying the 
lawyer and the activists, who wanted to argue that their Oct. 21 blockade at a 
suburban San Diego clinic saved lives, missed the point at a trespass trial. 
</P>
<P>
"They confuse intent with motive," Brainard said. "Their motive is to further 
the pro-life cause. Their intent was to blockade." 
</P>
<P>
Zal is known not only for his ever-present Bible, but also for making it clear 
he wishes to use the trials of anti-abortion protesters as a platform for 
debating and condemning abortion. Last year, in successfully defending 
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and four others of two dozen charges 
stemming from an Easter weekend blockade of a Los Angeles women's clinic, Zal 
repeatedly challenged Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Richard A. Paez to 
throw him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In another trial last fall in Fresno, Zal was handed a 16-day jail term for 
contempt but never served it, winning an appeal. Zal said Friday he thought he 
had an "excellent" chance of reversing Brainard's sentence, saying the judge 
made procedural mistakes in issuing the contempt citations. 
</P>
<P>
Zal's sentence could reach 290 days. The lawyer told the judge he couldn't 
afford the $10,000 fine -- and wouldn't pay even if he could -- so Brainard 
gave him the option of paying it off at $50 for each additional day in jail, or 
200 days. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said he had not cited anyone for contempt in his 11 years on the bench 
-- until Zal. Zal was the second attorney sentenced to a jail term in as many 
days by an El Cajon judge presiding over the trial of anti-abortion activists 
charged with trespass at the Oct. 21 protest at the Family Planning Associates 
clinic in La Mesa. At a hearing Thursday, Municipal Court Judge Victor E. 
Bianchini sentenced defense lawyer Colette Gonzalez to 10 days in jail for two 
contempt citations. 
</P>
<P>
Holman, publisher of the Reader, was led to jail immediately after Brainard 
sentenced him. Four other protesters convicted Wednesday of trespass also 
received 30-day jail terms. Besides Holman, three of those four were Zal's 
clients -- Carla Bulitsma, 49, of Pomona; Miles Robinson, 41, of Santa Barbara; 
and Gary Schuberg, 36, of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth, Marshall Wilson, 52, of Santee, served as his own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard sentenced two more activists, Zal clients who had prior convictions 
stemming from anti-abortion protests, to 10 days in county jail, a 25-day stint 
on a county work crew and three years probation. A condition of that probation 
is that the two -- David Leland, 37, of Laguna Hills, and Jeffrey Olkie, 28, of 
Carson -- not participate in future blockades.

CHARTER ISSUE AGAIN BODES AN OCEANSIDE DONNYBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the illusion of political tranquility, Oceanside's latest plunge into 
possibly becoming a charter city is rife with suspicions that are building 
toward an open conflict. 
</P>
<P>
A special citizens' commission is drafting a charter proposal with reforms 
aimed at spreading political power throughout the city and, in the process, 
helping minority candidates run for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the commission wants to switch from the existing system in which 
the council's five members are chosen at large in citywide elections. Instead, 
there would be a seven-member council, with the two additional members and a 
full-time mayor being elected at large and four members being chosen from 
special council districts. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question is control of the city," said Brian Graham, the commission 
chairman who points out that three current council members live near each 
other. "We don't have true representation of the governed when most of the 
council is from the same area. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who feel disenfranchised," he said, arguing that 
carving out council districts would draw greater political participation from 
all parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Three council members live in the Fire Mountain area. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a segment of Oceanside that thinks Graham's exhortations about 
democracy ring hollow. They suspect that a new political system is a coy 
attempt to keep a pro-growth majority on the council and make anti-development 
candidates more vulnerable to attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement to get this charter only surfaced when slow growth became a real 
contender," said Nancy York, a local lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for the 
council two years ago. "They're afraid a slow-growth majority will get on the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recent public hearings have raised only scant visible interest 
and debate. Seven people went to one session and 12 to another. But, York said, 
"There will be organized opposition to this. No question." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Oceanside had a bruising fight over changing from a general-law city 
to a charter city, the difference being that the latter form of government has 
somewhat more authority over its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust settled, the charter proposal, which involved establishing 
council districts and beefing-up the city staff, was bluntly defeated by an 
opposition vote of 61%. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of that charter attempt maintain that the voters were largely soured by 
the expense of creating new bureaucratic positions, but foes say there was also 
much skepticism over dropping at-large elections and going to council 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the city is again exploring taking a new charter proposal before 
the voters, perhaps as early as the June ballot. The debate so far has been 
low-key, nobody wanting to do battle, at least until the commission finishes 
drafting its plan. But nobody expects the peace to last. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people against it in '86 are still against it. They don't want to come 
out too early," said York. 
</P>
<P>
"Oceanside has a history of taking its politics seriously," Councilwoman Lucy 
Chavez said, remembering "two to three recalls and some of the rottenest 
campaigns that ever were." 
</P>
<P>
The rumblings so far on the charter issue suggest the city's tradition will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
As Graham sees it, the commission's main work is to craft a plan that would 
make local government more open. The plan's centerpiece would be enlarging the 
council by two members, electing a full-time mayor with a $34,000 annual salary 
(that's $10,000 more than the mayor is paid now), and establishing districts. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who beside leading the charter commission is also president of the 
Oceanside Merchants Assn., claims that the changes would encourage minorities 
to seek office and limit the influence of big campaign contributions from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Of Oceanside's 1988 population of 125,000 people, 61% were white, 21% Hispanic, 
8% black and 5% Asian or other. 
</P>
<P>
"Minorities in this city are shamefully under-represented" politically because 
of the cost of campaigning and feeling there's little chance of getting 
elected, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $10,000 to $15,000 to win a council seat, he said, adding "that's not 
representative politics, that's big bucks." Graham says the remedy is to create 
districts, including some that contain a significant minority population and 
therefore a natural constituency for minority candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Graham reasons that small election districts would reduce the influence of 
special interests, on the theory that district candidates wouldn't have to 
depend on large campaign war chests like citywide candidates do. However, 
campaign spending reports in the city of San Diego showed that new 
district-only elections did not reduce campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
"We're unstacking the deck," he said. "Right now, the only way to win a seat on 
the council is big bucks from developers. If you go to district representation, 
we break that power." 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission hasn't decided yet who would draw up the election 
districts, but he emphasized the need for objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
But York contends that minority representation is a phony issue and argues that 
there has been no problem getting minorities elected. She points to the current 
council as an example. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got an Hispanic (Chavez) on the council, women on the council, senior 
citizens on the council, and two members with Native American blood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another veteran foe of a charter, Harriett Bledsoe, who was active in the No on 
Charter Committee in 1986, disagrees with Graham that creating council 
districts would stem the power of special-interest campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Bledsoe argued, pro-growth forces might find it easier to defeat 
candidates in small districts. "They can target an area and pour money in. A 
person without a lot of money doesn't stand a chance," she said.

NOW URGES ADVERTISERS TO DROP READER

<P>
The North County chapter of the National Organization for Women sent letters to 
32 major advertisers Friday, urging them to pull their support from the San 
Diego Reader because of the anti-abortion activities of Publisher Jim Holman. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of business Friday, a spokeswoman for the longtime weekly 
newspaper said that Cutler's Cupboard, a cutlery shop in Horton Plaza, had been 
the only company to pull its advertising in response to the NOW request. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pro-choice and Jim Holman, our publisher, is pro-life, and they just 
disagree," said Janis Walsh, the paper's advertising manager. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holman was sentenced Friday to 30 days in County Jail after being 
found guilty of trespassing during an anti-abortion demonstration last fall at 
a La Mesa medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Holman intends to serve the duration of his sentence without posting 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
She conceded that his involvement had been "disruptive" to the Reader's 
operation and added: "We have had calls from a lot of people wanting to know 
what's going on. We do have loyal advertisers, and what I tell them is that the 
publisher's views do not necessarily represent the views of the salespeople. I 
would say that 99% of us feel the opposite way, meaning we're pro-choice. But 
Jim owns the paper, and he can put in whatever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Coppa, the manager of Cutler's Cupboard, said he and the owners of the 
shop decided to pull their ads after reading newspaper accounts of an ad in the 
Reader that promoted the concept of "jury nullification." 
</P>
<P>
The ad, from the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, attempted to school 
potential jurors on how to acquit anti-abortion protesters accused of 
trespassing, even if the evidence points overwhelmingly toward conviction. The 
ad, which appeared Jan. 25, was one of several anti-abortion articles and 
advertisements that have appeared in the Reader in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The press release from the Carlsbad office of NOW referred to the ad: 
</P>
<P>
"In protest to nullification ad by anti-choice in the San Diego Reader, we have 
sent letters from North County NOW to all major advertisers, urging them to 
pull support from the Reader, and also a mass mailing of thousands of post 
cards from individuals to mail to advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
"We think Jim Holman is doing something self-serving as well as threatening to 
our legal system," said Ann Russell, a board member of North County NOW. "It's 
our responsibility to be watching this, to get the word out to other people who 
support our positions." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said she had contacted 32 major advertisers, including the San Diego 
Hilton, the Comedy Store, the Wherehouse and the Belly Up Tavern. She said 
response so far has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled our ads because we feel the position of the paper is no longer 
representative to the public as a whole," said Coppa of Cutler's Cupboard. 
"Holman would rather be pro-life than qualify of life." 
</P>
<P>
Coppa said he and the couple who own the store are pro-choice, adding: "We 
don't believe in what these people are doing. Choice is what America is all 
about and always has been. It isn't one guy's opinion of what he thinks ought 
to be done. We'd rather pull the ads than pay for having a litany of views 
foisted on us by church fanatics who bomb clinics." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said the loss of Cutler's Cupboard would not be devastating to the 
Reader. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged some concern over the way other advertisers were leaning, and, 
when asked if NOW's efforts were a threat, she sighed and said: "It's hard to 
say. We do want people to know our views. 
</P>
<P>
"The misconception is that we don't print both sides of the issue. We do. Jim 
accepts all political ads and viewpoints. He's hoping that people from 
pro-choice organizations understand that." 
</P>
<P>
However, when pressed, Walsh said the paper would not publish ads informing 
readers of where and how to obtain abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Womancare Clinic wanted to run a political ad about pro-choice, we 
would accept that, but not, 'We perform abortions at this location Monday 
through Friday from 9 to 5.' No, we would not accept those."

DROWN SAYS HE KNEW FUND RULES WERE TO CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown denied Friday that he acted improperly by 
collecting large sums for his political campaign from members of the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department, saying he knew all along that a department policy 
barring such conduct was about to be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Drown said he accepted the money, which represents about three-fourths of the 
$3,650 he reported this week in his first campaign disclosure statement, only 
after he was assured by Janet Houts, the sheriff's legal adviser, that the 
policy would be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started receiving checks, I went to Janet and asked her to look 
at the matter and to find out what was her feeling here," Drown said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said the whole thing was under review by the county counsel's office to be 
put in compliance with the law. And then she said, 'It's going to be changed. I 
don't see any problem.' 
</P>
<P>
"So, based on that, we decided to go ahead and keep the checks." 
</P>
<P>
Houts declined Friday to discuss the situation, but Drown produced copies of 
two letters between Houts and the county counsel's office in which the policy 
was reviewed and a change suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Friday that Drown and outgoing Sheriff John Duffy collected 
thousands of dollars in contributions from sworn members of the Sheriff's 
Department or their spouses, all before a longstanding department policy 
banning such conduct was changed this week. 
</P>
<P>
In finance disclosure forms covering the last six months of 1989, Duffy 
reported that about 8% of his $25,935 in donations came from sworn members or 
their spouses. Drown stated that $2,700 of his money came from sworn members or 
their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Duffy accepted $250 -- the maximum allowable -- from Drown before 
the sheriff quit the race in December. And Drown disclosed that, after he 
announced that he was running for sheriff with Duffy's support, he collected 
$250 each from Duffy and his wife, Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy did not return phone calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the other candidates for sheriff, including sheriff's Capt. Jim 
Roache and on-leave Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, have suggested that the 
financial maneuvering and sudden policy shift indicate some kind of hidden 
agenda by Duffy and Drown. 
</P>
<P>
Drown on Friday was visibly angered by that characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no conspiracy with John Duffy," he said. "I've never even discussed 
this with John Duffy. The whole issue of an alleged conspiracy is the figment 
of someone's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he originally donated $250 to Duffy's campaign last July, Drown said 
he did so while attending a breakfast fund-raiser for the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Duffy) was not aware that any sworn people were invited to the breakfast," 
Drown said. "When he found out, he came back and offered me my check back. But 
I gave him the money back." 
</P>
<P>
Drown said Duffy did not want any sworn members to think they will receive 
special treatment if they make political contributions, a practice that Drown 
said he too intends to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never asked anybody for a financial contribution," he said. "But people 
have come in and volunteered to help. Some of their checks came in before we 
even had envelopes." 
</P>
<P>
Drown said that, at first, his campaign considered returning the money and 
asking contributors to resubmit it when the policy changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we decided not to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although he had read the department's Manual of Policies and 
Procedures, he did not immediately recall the provision against soliciting or 
receiving money from sworn department members and other county employees. After 
discussing the situation with Houts, he said, she advised him of a letter she 
had written the county counsel's office Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
That letter draws the county counsel's attention to the department's 
then-in-effect policies banning sworn members from accepting political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"We would appreciate your reviewing them to determine whether they are in 
conformance with current state and local laws, ordinances, rules and charter 
sections," her letter said. 
</P>
<P>
A Jan. 11 letter from Arne Hansen, deputy county counsel, noted that the 
government code allows sworn personnel to collect political money from other 
county employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We suggest that this clarification be added" to the departmental manual, the 
letter says. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Manual of Policies and Procedures was amended Tuesday to reflect that 
change, and the first filing deadline for campaign finance reports was on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, who has hired an attorney to review the policy change, said Friday that 
he is undecided if he now will accept money from sworn members of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"I still find it distasteful," he said, "because it puts employees of the 
organization in untenable positions. If they're approached by ranking officers 
for political contributions, they're almost compelled to give it for fear of 
future retribution." 
</P>
<P>
However Drown pointed out that Roache, who reported a total contribution of 
$6,880, did receive a $100 donation from Dianne S. Jacob. Because of her county 
employment status as chief of staff for Supervisor George Bailey, that donation 
is a technical violation of the old policy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's right. I stand corrected," Roache said. "But you won't find any deputy 
sheriffs in there."

A 32-year-old man died in a house fire early Friday while sleeping in a small, 
detached bedroom, the San Diego Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found Kim May, 32, dead in a corner of the bedroom, which had once 
been a detached single-car garage. A bed, a laundry hamper and a space heater 
were in room at 2827 Lincoln Ave. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:49 a.m., Jerry May, the victim's brother, discovered the fire when he 
heard screams for help, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was caused by the space heater, authorities said.

A United Airlines jet made a safe stop Thursday after two tires blew out just 
before takeoff from Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
There were 57 passengers and seven crew members aboard the Boeing 727 bound for 
Denver at 7 p.m., said Sara Dornacker, United Airlines spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
It took 40 minutes to clean up rubber debris on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Dornacker said that two right tires blew out as the aircraft approached the 
runway. The pilot aborted the takeoff and guided the jet to a stop near the 
east terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers debarked on mobile stairs. They stayed overnight in local hotels and 
were rebooked Friday on other United flights. 
</P>
<P>
"We were unable to find a suitable plane (Thursday) night that met the 
regulations for night noise," Dornacker said. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was slightly damaged and is undergoing repairs.

LOS ALAMITOS HITS FREE THROWS TO SINK LOARA 
</P>

<P>
Just when things started to get interesting Friday night, Los Alamitos High 
School found the poise, patience and know-how to put away Loara one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos hit 16 of 21 free throws in the fourth quarter and held off the 
Saxons to win, 86-82, in an Empire League game at Loara High School. With the 
victory, Los Alamitos clinched at least a tie for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
The game looked like a rout for the first half, with Los Alamitos (18-5, 8-0 in 
league play) holding a 19-8 lead after the first quarter and a 47-34 lead at 
halftime. But Loara came back strong in the second half, rallying for a 76-74 
lead with 2:40 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
But that's as close as Loara (14-6, 3-5) would get. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos center Robert Conlisk made both ends of a one-and-one and three 
other Griffins -- Kyle Hoffman, Jason Cunningham and Danny Stockwell -- 
repeated that feat to improve Los Alamitos' lead to 84-78 with 50 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"They proved why they're the league champions," Loara Coach Jerry Halpin said. 
"We did exactly what we wanted . . . (but) they sank all their free throws. 
They were dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Los Alamitos finished the game shooting 76% from the foul line. Loara 
made 68% of its free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We were poised when it counted," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said. "I'm 
really pleased to see them nail their free throws like that when they had to." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said that having never lost to Loara before, his team had the confidence 
in needed to hold off the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the first half, it didn't appear Los Alamitos would have to dig 
deeper than average effort, especially compared to the last time these teams 
met. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, Los Alamitos managed a 93-91 victory, despite Tes Whitlock's 54 
points. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, Whitlock, who averages 30.5 points a game, was held to just 
20, thanks to the defense of Danny Stockwell and an occasional extra Griffin 
defender when Brooks felt double-teaming was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Cunningham led Los Alamitos with 27 points, many on flashy drives through 
traffic. Conlisk had 17 points -- including three slams -- and four blocked 
shots. Stockwell added 15 points for the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Gaudio led Loara with 22 points, including six in a row to open the fourth 
quarter. Kareem Collins added 19 and Charlie Gipson 10 for Loara. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 95, Katella 57 -- Mike Bradach, a senior guard, scored a career-high 
40 points to lead host El Dorado (13-9, 4-4). Bradach was 10 of 14 from the 
field and 20 of 21 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
He had 15 points in the first quarter, eight in the second, 12 in the third and 
five before he came out in the fourth. Bradach also had 10 assists and seven 
rebounds. El Dorado led, 42-27, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 66, Esperanza 55 -- Tied at 31-31 at halftime, Cypress went into a 
full-court press and outscored visiting Esperanza, 21-6, in the third quarter 
on the way to its first league victory. Cypress (8-12, 1-7) was led by forward 
Courtney Smalley's 21 points. Kevin Smith and Jared Rice each added 18. Walter 
Forcatto scored 15 points for Esperanza (14-10, 6-2).

Ruben Oronoz hit three three-point baskets for Whittier Christian, but the one 
he missed in the final 10 seconds helped decide Friday's game with Orange 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran defeated Whittier Christian, 72-69, at Orange Lutheran High. 
Matt Bode's two free throws in the final seven seconds and Daryl Cole's steal 
at the buzzer ensured the Lancers' victory.

</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian's Kevin Wilch attempted to tie the game with a three-pointer 
in the final seconds but he lost the ball to Cole. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball just slipped out of his hands and went into my hands," said Cole. 
Cole, who had 29 points, hit five three-point baskets in the first half and had 
four rebounds for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Daryl just seems to do what needs to be done at the right time," Orange 
Lutheran Coach Jerry Simmons said. "It's nice to have a shooter who can do so 
many things." 
</P>
<P>
For Orange Lutheran, Brian Bedord had 12 points and 10 rebounds, Bode had seven 
points and six assists, and Luke Aucoin had seven assists.

Rancho Alamitos High School applied its full-court press to perfection Friday 
night, reeling off 29 consecutive points in the second quarter, and went on to 
a 101-73 victory over visiting Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way we practice it," Rancho Alamitos Coach Eric Hamamoto said of 
the scoring streak, "but you never expect the press to create that kind of 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't score a point, Oscar Ramirez, a 5-foot-6 guard, keyed the 
scoring run with five steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is what I do best," Ramirez said. "Lately, I've been sitting out a 
lot, but getting back in there tonight and helping the team felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove kept the score close early, closing to 22-21 on Bob Ioja's layup 
moments into the second quarter. Ioja finished with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vaqueros responded with their spree to take a 51-21 lead with 3:15 left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (16-4 overall, 10-1 in league play) remained tied for first 
place in the Garden Grove League with Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove (9-11, 7-4) scored just seven points in the second quarter, making 
three of 18 shots from the field. Rancho Alamitos also forced 11 turnovers in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Pruess sank four of eight three-point shots and finished with 26 points 
for the Vaqueros. David Green added 21 points for Rancho Alamitos, and Mark 
Perry had 18 points for Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 59, La Quinta 56 (OT) -- Van Trung banked in a 40-foot shot at the 
buzzer to give Santiago (7-12, 3-8) the victory at La Quinta. Paul Hastings hit 
a turnaround jump shot from five feet with 18 seconds left in regulation to 
send the game into overtime for La Quinta (0-19, 0-11). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 72, Los Amigos 43 -- Jim Barker had 27 points and nine rebounds and 
Jermaine Galloway had 12 points and nine rebounds to lead host Kennedy (13-6, 
10-1).

Tim Manning earned a reputation as a dangerous defensive player on the Trabuco 
Hills High School football team by intercepting an Orange County-record 24 
passes in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Manning was at it again on Friday night, but this time he was creating all 
kinds of defensive havoc on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Manning had five steals -- including three during two second-half runs -- as 
the Mustangs defeated Woodbridge, 85-77, at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Hossler scored a game-high 29 points and Manning added 26 as the Mustangs 
(14-8 overall, 8-0 in league play) tightened their grip on the Pacific Coast 
League lead with two games to play. They can clinch their second consecutive 
league title Wednesday night with a victory over second-place Laguna Beach 
(18-4, 7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills was clinging to an 80-77 lead with 1 minute 40 seconds left when 
Manning and James Welch forced consecutive turnovers. Hossler and Randy Kriech 
each scored off the turnovers to push the lead to 84-77. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with our defense," Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf said. "We made 
an adjustment at halftime in our press. And when you have the career (county) 
interception leader in the stealing spot, it makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon said the late turnovers gave Trabuco Hills 
control of the game. Woodbridge committed 22 turnovers to Trabuco Hills' 13.

<P>
"When it goes from two points to (seven) with a minute left," Shannon said, 
"you have a real hill to climb." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf said the Mustangs' defense kept them close. They trailed, 48-43, with 5:14 
left in the third quarter, but two steals and a three-pointer by Manning and 
baskets from Hossler and Welch gave Trabuco Hills the lead for good, 50-49, 
with 4:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players that if we played solid defense, we would be in the game 
even if we didn't shoot well," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs made only 13 of 31 shots in the first half and trailed, 40-37, at 
halftime. They made 18 of 25 shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to like it," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge played without leading scorer Bryant McLemore, who missed the team 
bus and arrived five minutes into the game. He never got off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say he was 'unavailable' " Shannon said. "The way Bryant has 
been practicing, and the way he shot Wednesday night against Costa Mesa (eight 
of 10), it was a factor that he wasn't there. He would have given us another 
guy inside." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors had plenty of help inside. Mike Manthei scored 18 points and 
Romalis Taylor added 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Warriors (13-10, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 57, Costa Mesa 51 -- Al Salbana had 25 points and Todd Peterson 
had 12 to lead visiting Laguna Hills (8-12, 2-6). Costa Mesa (14-9, 5-3) was 
led by Bret Dieball's 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 63, Orange 46 -- Center Dain Blanton scored 16 points and teammate 
John Trevino added 13 points for Laguna Beach.

CAPTAIN PLANET: HERE HE COMES TO SAVE THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just the idea of the cartoon series has changed Andy Heyward's life. He no 
longer wastes gas driving his 5-year-old son Robert Evan to school only five 
houses away. His company got rid of all non-biodegradable coffee cups. He is 
even recycling the story boards used for the series. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward, president of DIC Enterprises Inc., is developing an ecology-conscious 
cartoon called "Captain Planet and the Planeteers" that, beginning this fall, 
will tackle the most complicated and controversial environmental concerns of 
our day and try to make them palatable for 2- to 11-year-olds without scaring 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Topics such as acid rain, nuclear power and ozone depletion will be battled by 
a super-hero called Captain Planet in an animated fantasy that will be, its 
creators say, as scientifically accurate as possible. Other subjects to be 
dealt with in the first season include oil drilling, elephant poaching, drift 
net fishing, population growth and nuclear meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently reflecting the environmental concern that now exists in Hollywood, 
DIC has lined up a bevy of celebrities to provide the voices for its 
characters, including Tom Cruise as Captain Planet, LeVar Burton as one of his 
Planeteers and Whoopi Goldberg as Gaia, "the spirit of the planet Earth." 
Villains will be played by Richard Gere, Ed Asner, Meg Ryan, Dean Stockwell and 
John Ratzenberger. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the syndicated series was dreamed up by media mogul Ted Turner, 
president of Turner Broadcasting System and an environmentalist, who wanted to 
create a super-hero to inspire youngsters to take care of the world around 
them. The show will air on his TBS cable station and on an as-yet undisclosed 
number of other commercial TV stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"If watching the series inspires even one viewer to begin reversing this 
process (of environmental destruction)," Turner said, "then we are that much 
closer to environmental preservation for future generations." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Y.E. Pyle, co-executive producer of the series and vice president of 
Turner Broadcasting System's department for environmental policy, said that the 
project began when Turner called her in October, 1988, and uttered two words: 
Captain Planet. 
</P>
<P>
Pyle then dreamed up the concept of five children from different parts of the 
world who could each control an element of nature with a magic ring. Together 
their rings conjure up an icy blue super-hero with a flat-top haircut named 
Captain Planet. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Turner brought the project to DIC, the animation company that 
makes such series as "ALF Tales," "The Chipmunks," "The Real Ghostbusters" and 
"Super Mario Bros. Super Show." To help explore the complex issues, DIC is 
using non-paid consultants such as astronomer Carl Sagan, Greenpeace activist 
Peter Dykstra and undersea explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is how to simplify these complicated issues to something that 
children can grasp," said Robby London, DIC creative affairs vice president. 
"Everyone on the project has worked with children. We're keeping everything 
factual, but very simple." 
</P>
<P>
They also are striving not to paint too gloomy a scenario for young viewers. 
London said that the most important aspect of the show is to teach children how 
to make a difference now -- encouraging them to recycle cans, pick up garbage 
and stop asking parents to drive them everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"But our major goal is to entertain," Heyward noted. The villains are 
particularly colorful, with names like Verminous Skumm, Looten Plunder and Duke 
Nukem. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out at the thick smog from his sixth-floor Burbank office recently, 
Heyward said, "Some children in Los Angeles could look out the window today and 
think the Smog Monster has won, but we can't change reality. . . . Ultimately, 
this won't be a bummer because we will offer positive solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the cartoon characters will be headquartered on a place called Hope 
Island. "We show that you have to have hope and it's never too late, even on 
days like today," London said. 
</P>
<P>
TBS hopes to set off "Captain Planet" from the cacophony of Saturday morning 
kiddie cartoons by scheduling it on Sundays between news and religious 
programs. By sprinkling in adult double-entendres and somewhat sophisticated 
witticisms, the creators hope to attract a crossover audience of grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
It will be similar to many Saturday morning cartoons in another respect, 
however: DIC is hoping to launch a new line of "Captain Planet" toys, possibly 
including power rings similar to those in the show. DIC is now seeking 
corporate licensing for what it describes as "environmentally sound toys" -- 
with appropriate recyclable packaging -- but no toys will be ready before the 
show airs this fall.

RICK DU BROW: BOCHCO ASSIGNS HIS 'COP' A ROCK BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: PRODUCER THINKS VIEWERS ARE READY FOR 'COP ROCK,' WITH SONGS BY 
RANDY NEWMAN. IT'S ONE OF AT LEAST THREE NEW NETWORK SERIES PROJECTS WITH 
MUSICAL PREMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Bochco is going fishing again. First there was "Hill Street Blues," 
which revolutionized cop shows. Then there was "L.A. Law," a frank new TV 
approach to attorneys. And now, as one of his 10 series commitments to ABC, the 
producer is embarking on what seems by far his biggest gamble -- a weekly, 
one-hour, rock 'n' roll musical drama about Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Newman wrote the music for the pilot episode. The show, targeted for the 
fall season if all goes right, is called "Cop Rock." And, says Bochco, "This is 
not like 'Miami Vice,' where you hear the music while other things are 
happening. These are characters who sing and dance." 
</P>
<P>
All this, in itself, is intriguing enough. But even more intriguing, and 
promising, is the fact that "Cop Rock" is one of at least three new network 
series projects with musical premises. The first, "Elvis," a weekly half-hour 
drama about the young Elvis Presley, debuts Tuesday on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Bochco maintains, and correctly, that "Elvis" is distinct from "Cop Rock" 
because "the music is germane" to the singer's story -- "you couldn't do the 
show without his songs." In addition, he says, "Presley, on his own, draws 
interest simply as a subject." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the question on the minds of TV executives is bound to be whether 
viewers are finally ready to give new life, in any form, to weekly, prime-time 
musical series, a dead item on the networks for years. Did a decade of MTV 
perhaps lay the groundwork for a revival? 
</P>
<P>
The MTV factor may have been part of the thinking in the third musical project 
under way -- a one-hour NBC pilot from Disney tentatively titled "Hell Street 
High." Described by an NBC spokeswoman as a fast-paced, irreverent entry with 
elements of "Grease" and "Fast Times at Ridgmont High," it, too, is a fall 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
Bochco says the Disney show is "jumping on my bandwagon." No, it's not because 
"Hell Street High" seems a title vaguely close to, and somewhat mocking of, 
"Hill Street Blues," if only by coincidence. He's just certain he led the way. 
Asked whether "Hell Street High" was changed from a straight story to a 
musical, a Disney spokeswoman said, "Yes, I believe that's correct. They 
thought it (music) would make it more special." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, though, "Cop Rock" is a project of exceptional interest -- whether it 
explodes onto the scene like "Hill Street Blues," or even if it strikes out. It 
is, at least, a go-for-broke venture in the ultra-cautious world of network 
television, and no element thus far is more fascinating than the prospect of 
Newman's contributions. The composer-performer already has turned in his work 
for the pilot, Bochco reports. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," the producer says exuberantly. "Six songs -- main title theme and 
five songs. And they're spectacular. They're as good songs, I think, as Randy 
Newman has written." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, would be quite an accomplishment. But no one, including Randy 
Newman, is going to knock out half a dozen great songs a week over the length 
of an entire TV season, or two, or three, or four. So what does Bochco have in 
mind for a musical encore after the first episode? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that I can get Randy to stay involved somehow," he says. "He's a 
real storyteller. But, obviously, what I've got to do is put together a staff 
of songwriters, the same way you'd put together a staff of writers. So I'm 
hoping I can find three or four songwriters who will be responsible for 
providing the majority of the music you hear." 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, of course, the sound of music was a weekly staple of 
prime-time TV, though generally light years from the concept of a "Cop Rock" or 
"Elvis." In 1969, for instance, the networks offered weekly hours starring Andy 
Williams, Carol Burnett, Dean Martin, Leslie Uggams, Glen Campbell and Lawrence 
Welk, plus "The Kraft Music Hall." 
</P>
<P>
But musical series soon began to fade away. They were considered too soft to 
draw big ratings. The public cynicism that accompanied the Vietnam War seemed 
to give TV a harder edge. Variety shows became tougher with "Laugh-In" and "The 
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour." Sentimental ballads gave way to "All in the 
Family" and "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, someone tried, as Bochco is attempting now, to break the mold 
and win back audiences for musicals. In 1982, for instance, "Fame," with Debbie 
Allen, depicted students at a high school for the performing arts. In 1987, 
"Rags to Riches," with Joe Bologna, wove music into its story of a playboy who 
adopts a group of orphans. But neither show enjoyed a long network run. Musical 
series were out. 
</P>
<P>
In recent seasons, music found its only real home in weekly, network prime-time 
TV as an atmospheric element in such series as "Miami Vice," "China Beach" and 
"The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
But MTV was ever-present. And now comes "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Bochco has been mulling over the idea since 1983 or 1984, when someone 
suggested turning "Hill Street Blues" into a Broadway musical. He won't release 
the script and he won't give story details of the pilot, but he says it's not 
simply "Hill Street Blues" in musical form. 
</P>
<P>
It differs from that landmark police series "in a lot of significant ways," he 
says. "If you're looking for a theatrical analogy, I'd say it's almost like 
Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht ("The Threepenny Opera"). That's an exotic 
analogy," he admits. "Maybe 'West Side Story.' But the music isn't like that. 
The music is rock 'n' roll, although there are a couple of beautiful ballads 
that Randy wrote. It's set in the city of Los Angeles, so it's very realistic. 
It's completely contemporary -- action, personal drama, cop melodrama." 
</P>
<P>
No blushing violet, Bochco. And he's confident that "it's absolutely the right 
time to do something like this." Why? Well, he says, TV has grown up but 
there's not enough imaginative programming -- "simultaneous with which you've 
got the hardware, the sound systems, the TVs that are extraordinary, and 
there's nothing to fuel it. It's like you have a $75,000 touring car and 
nobody's got the fuel to fire the engine." 
</P>
<P>
Why is he so sure he can ignite TV again -- and the public? Easy, he says: 
"You've got 10 years of MTV under your belt. I'm not representing what we're 
doing as anything like MTV. God forbid. Nevertheless, you do have a couple of 
generations of TV viewers who are used to the idea of watching music performed 
to some sort of accompanying story line (in videos). So now, you come along 
with 'Cop Rock,' and it seems to be a sort of organic evolution to go from 
those silly little stories that last a few minutes to something more complex." 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder, though: Would Sgt. Joe Friday sing an aria? Would Lt. 
Columbo do a pirouette? Welcome to the 1990s. And, oh yes, I love L.A.

THE RESURGENCE OF REGGAE; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: MAJOR LABELS SIGN MORE ARTISTS AND WATCH SALES RISE. THE JAMAICAN 
STYLE ENJOYS RENEWED POPULARITY WITH A NEW GENERATION OF PERFORMERS AND FANS.

Marcia Griffiths didn't expect the second coming of the Electric Boogie. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran reggae singer, a member of the I-Threes vocal group that backed Bob 
Marley for years, released a record called "Electric Boogie" in 1983. But the 
single wasn't successful outside the reggae scene and didn't even become a 
fixture in her own concert repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
After a Washington deejay began playing the record last summer, other stations 
picked up on the song, and Griffiths suddenly found herself with a runaway hit 
in the nation's capital that spawned a club dance craze, the electric slide. 
</P>
<P>
Island Records released a re-mixed version of the single last summer, and it 
has been hovering in recent weeks around the Top 50 of the Billboard pop 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
The delayed success of "Electric Boogie" is part of a bigger story: Largely 
dismissed within record-industry circles as a Next-Big-Thing-That-Never-Was 
after the 1981 death of Bob Marley, the music's greatest star, reggae is 
enjoying a renewed popularity. 
</P>
<P>
It's still an underground music, but there are undeniable signs that the 
Jamaican style is on the upswing: more major-label deals for reggae artists, 
steadily increasing sales for reggae-oriented labels, and the arrival of a new 
generation of performers and fans. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the '70s, when the reggae world was caught in the spell of Bob Marley, 
the music's fortunes no longer seem tied to an individual. While the success of 
his son Ziggy's 1988 album "Conscious Party" was a crucial catalyst, most 
observers agree that the new reggae audience broadly supports the music as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more hope now for reggae than I've seen in the years since Bob died," 
said Roger Steffens, a former co-host of KCRW-FM's influential "Reggae Beat" 
program. "There is fresh new blood, there are people without long memories and 
people willing to take it to a new stream. That's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence was brought home forcefully last February when the annual Bob 
Marley Day salute filled the 12,000-capacity Long Beach Arena. For longtime 
reggae observers who had been there at the beginning and seen the 1982 
celebration in MacArthur Park featuring local bands and drawing perhaps 1,000 
people, the Long Beach sellout was a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Bob Marley Day concert, scheduled today from 1:30 to 8 p.m., will 
again be at the Long Beach Arena, where another sellout is expected. The lineup 
includes the original Black Uhuru (Don Carlos, Garth Dennis and Duckie 
Simpson), the Mighty Diamonds, Shinehead and Tippa Irie. 
</P>
<P>
This rise in reggae's fortunes is especially dramatic in view of the pop 
industry's pessimism about the commercial viability of the music after Marley's 
1981 cancer death. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a definite lull after Bob's death because it was almost like reggae 
had not only lost its founding father but its leader," said Los Angeles deejay 
Ron Miller. "They were looking for somebody else to spearhead the movement, and 
no one came along that could fill those shoes. What took the leadership role 
was the music itself." 
</P>
<P>
The shock waves from Marley's death even affected some of reggae's strongest 
champions within the record industry. It was one of the factors that caused 
Chris Blackwell, whose Island Records label initially brought Marley and reggae 
to the world, to back away from the music during the early '80s. But now 
Blackwell sees interest in the music rising again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been brought about by Ziggy, who has become a real point of focus 
and leader," Blackwell said, by phone from Jamaica. "That was what reggae was 
lacking for some time. He brought some attention to himself and through that to 
the music and other artists." 
</P>
<P>
The figures may not be dramatic by rap or even underground rock standards, but 
the revitalized spirit in reggae is being reflected in record stores and 
concert sales. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer Tony Johnson started the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1978 to 
provide a live showcase for reggae in Jamaica. Johnson took Sunsplash to London 
in 1984, and two years later started the package tours in America that are 
bringing the music into new markets. This year's Sunsplash tour should hit 
Southern California in May. 
</P>
<P>
* Rick Hocutt, vice president of California Record Distributors in Glendale, 
said that West Coast sales on Heartbeat and Mango, the small labels that have 
released the bulk of reggae records here during the '80s, have doubled in the 
last two years. Mango, for example, jumped from 96,000 in 1988 to 169,000 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Real Authentic Sounds (RAS) Records, the Washington-based label that provides 
American distribution for 30 to 40 Jamaican labels, increased its sales by 50% 
last year from 1.2 million to 1.8 million. RAS founder Gary Himelfarb expects 
to crack the 2-million unit barrier this year, but he doesn't view the 
increased sales as a sign of mainstream acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, reggae and mainstream are oxymorons because reggae is an underground 
type music," he said. "It's for people who have deep feelings for humanity, and 
a lot of people don't want to be burdened with what's wrong with this world and 
how to make it better." 
</P>
<P>
There are other signs of reggae's vitality: the wide array of talent, a variety 
of reggae styles and reggae's penetration of the American pop mainstream, even 
beyond its influence on hits like Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
But the most dramatic new development is that reggae, which has primarily 
attracted a white, rock-oriented crowd, may finally be making inroads with the 
African-American audience that has long resisted it. Ziggy Marley's "Tumbling 
Down" reached No. 1 on the black singles chart, a first for a reggae artist 
here, and director Spike Lee included Steel Pulse's "Can't Stand It" in his 
acclaimed "Do the Right Thing" film. 
</P>
<P>
More intriguingly, a fusion of reggae and hip-hop has surfaced in the last six 
months. Shinehead's canny blend of the two styles on his 1988 album "Unity" was 
the first portent, and now Sly &amp; Robbie's "Silent Assassin" collaboration 
with rap producer KRS-One has accelerated the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Aspects of the reggae rhythm are a tremendous dynamic in the hip-hop field, 
and that's starting to merge with rap culture," said Blackwell of Island 
Records. "Early Jamaican deejay records were somewhat of a precursor of rap 
music, so there's a lot in common in those two attitudes to music." 
</P>
<P>
The situation for live reggae in Los Angeles is volatile. The Rebel Rockers are 
familiar with the ups and downs common to American reggae bands -- record label 
interest that faded away after Marley's death and offers from producers who 
were willing to work with them . . . if they changed their sound.

<P>
The Laguna Beach-based quintet went directly to the source, recording and 
releasing a few singles on Jamaican labels and even appearing twice at the 
Reggae Sunsplash event there. 
</P>
<P>
New-breed Los Angeles artists are making headway by releasing their own records 
and plugging into reggae's international tour circuit. Vocalist Swelele went to 
Japan for three months last year and is starting to attract major-label 
attention after several singles for local labels. 
</P>
<P>
Boom Shaka's "Creation" album was picked up by Celluloid Records last year 
after the group initially released it on its own label. They toured Europe and 
introduced live reggae to Tunisia at a government-supported cultural festival 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I listen to Bob Marley, I hear Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, so 
he was influenced by the things that were around him at that time," said Trevy, 
lead singer for Boom Shaka. 
</P>
<P>
"To even think about looking for a new Marley is madness. That's like looking 
for another Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane -- it can't be. Those people just 
come like a falling star and you can't duplicate a situation like that."

AFTER THE WALL: AN EAST GERMAN IN LONG BEACH'S 'COPPELIA'; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: DAVID WILCOX DEDICATES TODAY'S PREMIERE TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND BRINGS 
IN BALLET MASTER THOMAS VOLLMER AS DR. COPPELIUS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Caught up in the euphoria of East Berlin's liberation, Long Beach Ballet 
director David Wilcox barely knew what to do first. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, he dedicated his production of "Coppelia," which has its premiere 
this afternoon, to the German people. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a wave of nostalgia. He remembered walking across Checkpoint Charlie 
several times -- as a dancer with the (West) Berlin Ballet -- to see the 
Komische Oper Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely wonderful," he recalls, "and the memory set something off in 
me, a desire to reach out to these artists . . . about to enjoy freedom at 
last." 
</P>
<P>
So on Jan. 11, in a moment of unbridled optimism, he picked up the phone and -- 
after much difficulty -- finally reached Tom Schilling, the company's director: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Nothing could make me happier,' I told Schilling, 'than having one of your 
dancers come here to perform Dr. Coppelius. What better way to celebrate?' And 
he seemed just as eager as I to accomplish the goal." 
</P>
<P>
So begins a tale of two cities and Thomas Vollmer, among the first dancers from 
Germany's newly open sector to travel the free circuit for a guest engagement 
since the Wall's crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Director Schilling told director Wilcox that he had, in Vollmer, the perfect 
candidate: someone who could dance a romantic role like Romeo as well as the 
caractere part that needed to be filled in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But in all the excitement, Wilcox was not told until the end of the 
conversation that the agreed-upon guest artist held the title of Tanzmeister, 
or ballet master, or that he had won the Bronze Medal at Moscow's 1983 
International Ballet Competition, marking him as a supreme technician. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the Long Beach Ballet had first sought Dudley Moore to 
impersonate the crotchety old Coppelius and then Stanley Holden, who 
specializes in such comic characterizations, Vollmer, a virtuoso in his prime, 
seemed miscast. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas doesn't know the traditional 'Coppelia' at all," says Wilcox. "But 
he'll learn it in time. What really bothers me is using him for a role that 
ignores his technique. So I've devised a little something at the conclusion to 
show off the real talent." 
</P>
<P>
Getting Vollmer a work visa, it turned out, required extensive documentation -- 
including reviews and references proving that he was, indeed, an exceptional 
dancer. But fax operations between East Berlin and Long Beach left something to 
be desired. So when the crucial packet finally arrived -- just last week -- 
Wilcox was nearly frantic. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the airport to collect it," Wilcox says, "and then directly to 
Chatsworth, where an official could translate the articles, every word, into 
English. Meanwhile Vollmer's ticket was waiting at the airline counter in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally we got the OK and a day and a half later, on Jan. 26, Thomas arrived 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 33-year-old native of Leipzig has been "just flabbergasted," 
says Wilcox, who speaks German fluently and translates for his guest. 
</P>
<P>
They stopped on the way back from LAX at a large food market, and Vollmer found 
the spectacle "scary," feeling like Coppelius in Wonderland as he beheld bin 
after bin filled with fresh, crisp vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"And fruit," Vollmer says in amazement. "During the winter it's non-existent at 
home. People stand in long lines only to find empty shelves." 
</P>
<P>
Driving down the San Gabriel River Freeway, they saw a half-mile long stretch 
of car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
No such instant wheels where Vollmer comes from: "We must be on a waiting list 
15 years to buy a car." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Long Beach Ballet studio he also confronts a whole new situation. 
His single experience with Dr. Coppelius involved a revisionist one -- with the 
old toy maker being in love with Swanilda and then fashioning a doll that 
looked like the heroine. 
</P>
<P>
However, the dancer from East Berlin is not so overloaded with new information 
that he fails to see the big picture of his expanding world. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a country," says Vollmer, "where people live poorly, you can't 
imagine how poorly. But artists are special, they're given every advantage -- 
while, here, amid incredible wealth, there is no money for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"After a long, exhausting rehearsal I asked to take a shower, but David waved 
his hand around the meager studio and told me none exists on the premises. What 
a contrast between our countries. How different the mentality."

FEAR OF LAWSUIT TO CLOSE 'SINATRA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Edenetti will close his "Sinatra" show at the Las Palmas Theatre in 
Hollywood next Saturday in response to a request from theater owner Paolo 
Greco, who feared legal action against the theater from Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
Greco said he recently discovered a Dec. 5 letter to the theater from Sinatra 
attorney Robert Finkelstein, asking him to cease "unauthorized exploitation of 
Mr. Sinatra's name, likeness and voice." 
</P>
<P>
Finkelstein had written a similar letter to Edenetti, which had been publicized 
at the time. But Edenetti continued doing his show, and he said he had not 
heard from the attorney since that date. 
</P>
<P>
Edenetti said that Greco ordered the show closed because of the letter from 
Sinatra's lawyer. Edenetti said he contacted Finkelstein on Thursday to inquire 
if legal action was still planned against his show -- and he was told that it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our policy not to make any public statements," Finkelstein told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Edenetti said he had invested more than $250,000 in the show and expected it to 
begin breaking even around Valentine's Day.

GROUP'S 25-YEAR GOAL: THE GREAT BLACK MUSIC ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Our music is primarily intended to stimulate thought, to get people to make 
new rationales," said Art Ensemble of Chicago trumpeter Lester Bowie. "We come 
from jazz, blues and everything, but we're about establishing sort of a new 
reality on that, relating to those forms in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're creating a music that people of the world can relate to. Jazz served as 
a link to all these forms because jazz gives a foundation that develops your 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran quintet -- Bowie, Joseph Jarman and Roscoe Mitchell (reeds), 
Malachi Favors Maghostut (bass) and Famoudou Don Moye (drums) -- makes its 
first Los Angeles appearance in six years at UCLA's Wadsworth Theater tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, the Art Ensemble has been recording a seven-record project for 
DIW, the Japanese label that has released its three most recent albums. The new 
batch includes two records with the South African a cappella vocal group 
Amabutho, a homage to Thelonious Monk with pianist Cecil Taylor, a tribute to 
John Coltrane, a studio album by Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy group and the Art 
Ensemble with Brass Fantasy recorded live in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The group has focused its concert performances as a unit on special projects -- 
like the string of West Coast concerts with Women of the Calabash, the 
vocal/percussion trio who will perform their own set and join the Art Ensemble 
at UCLA tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Calabash fit in with our scheme of trying to present a larger production," 
explained Moye. "We're building toward the Great Black Music Orchestra, which 
would encompass all of the bands (associated with them) -- the Leaders, Art 
Ensemble, Brass Fantasy, Joe Bowie, etc." 
</P>
<P>
The Art Ensemble was formed as an outgrowth of the creative ferment spawned by 
the Assn. for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) organization in 
Chicago during the mid-'60s. Initially a quartet, the group moved to Paris in 
1969, absorbed the Detroit-bred Moye the following year, and quickly developed 
an international reputation while performing under the motto of "Great Black 
Music: Ancient to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the comments were favorable. Maghostut (who goes by the name Favors), 
Jarman and Moye had started their ongoing practice of performing in face paint 
and African robes, and that led some critics to accuse the Art Ensemble of 
using visual gimmickry to mask musical shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started to paint, people were saying that we were playing hate 
music," remembered Favors. "People have to recognize that we are basically an 
African people. Even though we have a lost a lot of our traditions as African 
people, we still have a connection spiritually with that." 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Art Ensemble also developed individual careers from their 
separate home bases -- Bowie and Jarman live in New York City, Favors and Moye 
in Chicago, and Mitchell calls Madison, Wis., home. The ideas and experiences 
gleaned from those projects are fed into the group's free-flowing 
improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
Recording for a Japanese label won't make the Art Ensemble of Chicago a 
household name here but neither will a lack of American recognition deter the 
group from pursuing its long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the eternal optimists," declared Moye. "If we encounter resistance in a 
certain area, we pull back. In the context of 20-25 years of activity, a blank 
in a certain zone over a couple of years doesn't mean that much. We structured 
our whole (organization), conceptually, to be able to pick and choose an area 
where there's true interest."

KPFK'S 'FOLKSCENE' WILL CELEBRATE ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY;

LONGEST-RUNNING LIVE-MUSIC FORUM.

The second-worst thing that ever happened to Roz and Howard Larman during their 
two decades hosting the KPFK-FM radio show "Folkscene" was the time they 
inadvertently got locked in the station's studio with an ill musician who was 
growing a bit green around the gills. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought, 'Great, we'll be locked in here forever,' " said Roz, laughing 
with her husband of 33 years as they sat in the dining room of their small 
Canoga Park house. 
</P>
<P>
The worst thing was an unprintable incident involving a drugged-out performer 
launching into a stream of semi-coherent expletives live on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a few times that station management changed the locks and the 
Larmans couldn't get in to do the show, that was about all the Larmans could 
think of when asked about the lowlights of "Folkscene." It's the good things 
that are on their minds these days -- the special guests and serendipitous 
moments that have linked the show through two decades of tremendous changes in 
culture, folk music and at the often-tumultuous station itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We've survived all the coups and the cuckoos," Roz said of their sometimes 
uneasy -- but now quite friendly -- stay at the station, a Pacifica outlet 
known for its often left-wing agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Those high points are what will fill two special 20th anniversary "Folkscene" 
broadcasts this weekend, 20 hours in all, with highlights from the '70s aired 
from noon to 10 p.m. today and the '80s the same time period on Sunday on the 
non-commercial station (90.7 FM). 
</P>
<P>
"Someone asked us the other day what we mean by 'folk music,' " Roz said. "We 
said, 'If we like it, it's folk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Howard Larman estimates that he and Roz have hosted more than 2,000 live 
performances and interviews (the show is L.A. radio's longest-running live 
music forum), which they've been culling through feverishly for several months 
at their home studio to assemble the special programs. In the process they've 
dug up audio documents of such moments as performances by Angeleno songsters 
Randy Newman and Tom Waits, the West Coast debut of Don McLean's "American Pie" 
and visits from just about every noteworthy bluegrass, country, Celtic, roots 
or singer-songwriter type who has drifted through town in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, you had the remnants of the '60s folk scene, where if you had three 
chords and a capo you were a folk singer," Howard said. "It's no longer that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The broad definition of folk music has rankled some die-hard folk 
traditionalists, but it's also brought the Larman's a wide following of people 
interested in the relationships of different musical traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that folk music as we thought of it in the '60s and '70s is quite 
limited," said pop singer Jennifer Warnes, who has performed on "Folkscene" 
several times. "The Larmans are just interested in what they're interested in. 
I like that." 
</P>
<P>
Warnes is just one of many performers -- folk and otherwise -- who count 
themselves as "Folkscene" fans. Some of them, including Peter Case, 
country-rockers Lucinda Williams and the Lonesome Strangers, will help the 
Larmans celebrate with a concert at At My Place in Santa Monica on March 8. 
Proceeds will be donated to KPFK. 
</P>
<P>
The show's followers listen as much for the Larmans as for the music. The 
couple is a storehouse of knowledge about whatever fits their definition of 
folk music, which they dispense in a very casual manner, with wit and humor 
(often at each other's expense). Neither would likely qualify as a radio 
professional, but their obvious love for the medium and the music renders that 
moot. 
</P>
<P>
It was Howard's love for radio (as a boy in Chicago he hung out at broadcasts 
of "Captain Midnight" and "Jack Armstrong") and his professional life as an 
electrical technician -- first in the Marines and then for 20 years in the 
aerospace industry -- that landed him as a part-time technician for KPFK in the 
late '60s. When a KPFK station manager learned of his love for folk music, 
"Folkscene" was born, with the first broadcast taped in the Larmans' living 
room on Feb. 3, 1970. Eventually the show moved to the Sunday night slot (it 
runs from 7:30 to 10 p.m. now) with a 90-minute taped show on Tuesdays at 9:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our way into the music," Roz said. "We used to play music ourselves, 
but found people who could do it better." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously "Folkscene" is a labor of love for the unpaid volunteers (as well as 
their assistants, including engineer Peter Cutler, who has turned a 
once-amateur show into a professional-sounding live music showcase). But even 
the most loyal listeners may not realize that it's also the main drain for 
their discretionary income. 
</P>
<P>
"We buy our own tape, pay for our phone calls, use our own equipment" said 
Howard, who took vacation from work (he's a technician for Pacific Bell; Roz 
investigates credit-card disputes for a bank) to concentrate on the special 
shows. "I've looked at this from all views. I've spent time with people who go 
boating or play golf. They spend lots of money on that. This is our 
recreation."

WRITING A LOVE LETTER IS EASIER THAN YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW SOERGEL, SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Valentine's Day, try something a little more daring than a box of 
chocolates. Write a love letter to someone you love, or to someone you hope 
will love you back. 
</P>
<P>
"Love letters are never out of style," said Susan Polis Schutz, co-founder of 
Blue Mountain Arts, a Boulder, Colo., greeting card company. "Everyone needs to 
communicate honestly. Often it's easier to do it in writing." 
</P>
<P>
Writing a love letter -- to some, a terrifying prospect -- may be easier than 
you think, Schutz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I find it a lot easier to write my feelings down, especially about 
love," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A letter can be more honest; some people are too embarrassed to speak their 
feelings. You can think about it in advance, and rewrite it as many times as 
you want. And a letter can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
"For the receiver, it is very nice to get a letter because it's something you 
can see and hold for a long time," said Schutz. "A conversation goes into your 
heart, but you can't see it later." 
</P>
<P>
Don't sweat over trying to find just the right style, she recommends. 
</P>
<P>
"Just write it and, if it expresses what you think, fine. Don't be afraid of 
what style it is, or what others will think or who will judge it. The purpose 
is to express your feelings. And that's the only purpose."

GOVERNOR PICKS FRIEND ARABIAN FOR HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian will announce today that he is appointing Appellate 
Justice Armand Arabian, his longtime friend and early political supporter, to 
the California Supreme Court, informed sources said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Arabian, now serving on the state Court of Appeal in Los 
Angeles, will replace Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, another Deukmejian appointee 
who retired from the high court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian, whose nomination is to be officially disclosed on the governor's 
weekly radio address, could not be reached for comment, but issued the 
following statement through a family member: 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply honored to have been selected by Gov. Deukmejian as his nominee to 
the Supreme Court. Upon confirmation, I look forward to joining a noble court 
as it faces the challenges which lie ahead and in its effort to apply the 
purest standards of justice to the needs of the people it serves." 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Arabian will be subject to confirmation by the state Judicial 
Appointments Commission, currently composed of Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, 
state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth, 
senior presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to set a hearing on the nomination within a month. 
Confirmation is widely expected and Arabian could be sworn in as a member of 
the high court as early as March. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian was among several Court of Appeal justices Deukmejian disclosed he was 
considering for Kaufman's post late in November. Besides the new nominee, the 
governor's list included, among others, Appellate Justices Carl West Anderson 
of San Francisco, Ronald M. George of Los Angeles and H. Walter Croskey of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent days, there was increasing speculation among court observers that 
the governor might name his old friend and fellow Armenian-American to the 
court. By late Friday, word had escaped and quickly spread that, indeed, 
Arabian was to be Deukmejian's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and Arabian became acquainted when they represented opposing sides 
in a lawsuit in the early 1960s. The two men got to be friends and Arabian 
attended political dinners and other campaign activities held in Deukmejian's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Philibosian, a former Los Angeles County district attorney and 
longtime associate of both the governor and Arabian, recalled the new nominee 
as one of Deukmejian's earliest backers. "When the governor first ran for the 
state Assembly, one of the first to support him was Armand Arabian," said 
Philibosian. 
</P>
<P>
The former district attorney described Arabian as an expert legal analyst and 
writer whose judicial skills would combine "with a very solid law-and-order 
philosophy" on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Philibosian noted also that Arabian, only 55, could be expected to serve for a 
relatively long period. "He's a vigorous and young man and we can look forward 
to literally decades of service from him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his judicial career spans 18 years, Arabian is perhaps best known in 
legal circles for a pioneering ruling he made as a Superior Court judge in 
1973. At the conclusion of a rape trial, Arabian refused to give jurors a 
then-required instruction to view the woman victim's testimony with caution -- 
a directive critics perceived as improperly undermining the victim's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the state Supreme Court struck down the controversial 
instruction -- and Arabian went on to write a number of law review articles on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles attorney and leader in feminist legal causes, 
remembers the case as a judicial landmark and notes that today Arabian often 
attends gatherings of women lawyers and lends his support. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very conservative, but on the other hand, he seems to have cared deeply 
about this issue, which affects so many women," Allred said Friday night. "I 
hope that this translates into equal concern for civil rights in general. Of 
the many conservatives the governor could have chosen, I am happy that he chose 
Armand." 
</P>
<P>
Arabian will become the seventh appointment Deukmejian has made to the state 
Supreme Court since he became governor in 1983. Deukmejian's first nominee was 
Lucas, his former law partner and a federal district judge, who joined the 
state court as an associate justice and was elevated by Deukmejian to succeed 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's choices thus far have been regarded as from conservative to 
moderate in their judicial philosophies -- and from most indications, Arabian 
appears likely to fit into a similar mold. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, there is little likelihood his presence on the court will cause a 
sharp shift in the court's philosophical balance. The four Deukmejian 
appointees now on the court -- Lucas and Justices Edward A. Panelli, David N. 
Eagleson and Joyce L. Kennard -- thus far have proved generally conservative. 
Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, both appointees of Democratic 
governors, make up the court's liberal wing. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian was born Dec. 12, 1934, in New York City. In 1962, he married Nancy 
Megurian and the couple have two children, Allison Ann and Robert Armand 
Arabian. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army and received 
undergraduate and law degrees at Boston University. After admission to the 
California Bar in 1962, he served as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles 
and then entered private law practice in Van Nuys . 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1972 by then-Gov. Ronald 
Reagan, elevated to the Superior Court the next year and then was appointed to 
the state Court of Appeal by Deukmejian in 1983.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya was convicted Friday on seven counts of extortion, 
racketeering and money-laundering, becoming the first California legislator in 
35 years to be found guilty of felony corruption charges while in office. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic climax to the two-month trial, the federal court jury rejected 
Montoya's contentions that he never traded his vote for money and had been "set 
up" by federal undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya -- who sat impassively as the verdicts were read -- was acquitted on 
three other charges of extortion, including one involving actor Ed Asner. 
Montoya's lawyers said they would appeal the guilty verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Democrat from Whittier faces up to 20 years in prison on each 
of the seven counts and could be fined a total of more than $1.75 million. 
Under the state Constitution, he does not automatically forfeit his seat in the 
Legislature but could be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the verdict, at least five of Montoya's colleagues began 
calling on the veteran legislator to resign before the Senate moves to oust 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who left the courtroom without comment, was the only legislator 
indicted in an ongoing federal investigation of political corruption in the 
state Capitol. He was snared in an FBI sting operation in June, 1988, when he 
accepted a $3,000 payment from an undercover agent at a breakfast meeting near 
the Capitol that was secretly videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty verdicts were a major victory for U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who has 
headed the controversial 4-year-old investigation and personally helped 
prosecute Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Levi called on other victims of legislative extortion to step forward, and he 
warned state lawmakers that they will remain under close scrutiny by his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the conviction will be helpful to us as we pursue a public 
corruption program, one that is always in place and always following leads," 
Levi said. "One of the most successful things about this case is that it shows 
that a public official who takes campaign contributions and honorariums and is 
smart enough to report them can still be convicted." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the seven-woman, five-man jury said the panel looked for ways to 
acquit Montoya. But in the end, the jurors said, they found that the 
explanations Montoya gave during four days on the witness stand did not hold 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish he had been able to defend himself better," said juror Emily Ingram of 
Benicia. "It wasn't an easy decision to make. We toiled over it, all of us. We 
lost sleep. We couldn't eat. . . . We really tried to find him innocent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Connection 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they were persuaded not so much by the videotape of Montoya taking 
money from an undercover FBI agent but by the cumulative evidence that he 
sought payments in connection with various bills pending in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the connection between the money and the legislation," juror Greg 
Coumas of Stockton told reporters at a press conference after the verdict was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the jury found Montoya guilty of extortion in taking the $3,000 
payment from the undercover agent who was pushing legislation to benefit the 
FBI's dummy shrimp company. In accepting the money, Montoya promised he would 
"be there" to vote for the bill when it came up on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found the senator guilty of attempting to extort payments from 
Florida insurance executive Douglas O. Ruedlinger, the National Football League 
Players' Assn., then-sports agent Michael Trope and lobbyists representing 
foreign medical universities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more compelling pieces of evidence, jurors said, was a "schedule of 
fees" Montoya sent to Trope spelling out when he should pay $10,000 in campaign 
contributions and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to finding the senator guilty of extortion, the jury decided that 
the five acts of extortion constituted a pattern of illegal behavior that 
violated the federal anti-racketeering statute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laundering Count 
</P>
<P>
And the jury found the senator guilty of violating a money-laundering law 
designed primarily for the prosecution of drug dealers. Montoya broke the law 
simply by depositing the payment from the undercover agent in his personal bank 
account, the jury found. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was acquitted on three counts of extortion alleging that he had 
solicited payments from Asner, then-president of the Screen Actors Guild, the 
Allan Co. recycling firm and the California Independent Petroleum Assn. 
</P>
<P>
On those counts, members of the jury said, there was not sufficient evidence 
that Montoya solicited any payments. In particular, they pointed to the fact 
that Asner had difficulty remembering details of his encounter with Montoya in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wider Distress 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the case against Montoya, several jurors said they were distressed 
by evidence presented during the trial that other legislators are frequently 
influenced by money they receive from special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the only one," said Cindy Tufts, a juror from Carmichael. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael Sands expressed disappointment in the verdict and said 
he will appeal on grounds that several rulings by U.S. District Judge Milton L. 
Schwartz handicapped Montoya's defense. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, the defense was limited by the judge's ruling that it 
could not present evidence from other legislators on why they voted for the 
shrimp legislation pushed by undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
Citing corruption scandals in Congress that led to the ouster of Speaker Jim 
Wright and a pending Senate ethics investigation of Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), Sands also said that the political climate made winning the case 
all the more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Very definitely, a trial at this time is made very difficult by the public 
perception," Sands told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Montoya's reaction was to the verdict, Sands said, "I think he was 
dismayed somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is scheduled to be sentenced on April 26. He will remain free on his 
own recognizance until then. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was announced, other members of the Senate immediately began 
attempting to distance themselves from Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were him, I would resign," said fellow Democratic Sen. Art Torres of Los 
Angeles. "I hope he doesn't put us through the expulsion process." 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Henry Mello (D-Watsonville) said: "I would have no reservation about 
voting for expulsion. It's up to him to resign if he wants to. In either case, 
he is out." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said he hoped to 
avoid an expulsion vote and will meet with Montoya on Monday to discuss his 
"status." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sens. Ed Davis of Los Angeles, William Craven of Oceanside and John 
Seymour of Anaheim all called on Montoya to resign before his Senate colleagues 
are forced to take action. "I'm confident they would vote to expel him," Craven 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Problems 
</P>
<P>
With his trial over, Montoya will now face a new round of legal problems. Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's office has indicated that it will go to court to 
seek civil fines against the senator for the misuse of as much as $100,000 in 
campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
And during the trial, prosecutors indicated that the Internal Revenue Service 
may move against Montoya for not reporting money he diverted from his campaign 
fund as personal income. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Montoya admitted diverting more than $45,000 in campaign 
funds to his personal use, including pocketing reimbursements for travel 
expenses and paying for such items as travel, clothes and videos. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya also is certain to be challenged in the June primary election by a 
fellow Democrat, Assemblyman Charles Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time social worker, Montoya was first elected to public office at age 28 
when he was elected to the La Puente City Council in 1968. Four years later, he 
was elected to the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he won election to the Senate in a nasty campaign against fellow 
Democrat Sen. Alfred H. Song of Monterey Park, who was under investigation by 
the FBI but was never indicted. 
</P>
<P>
As a legislator, Montoya is viewed by many of his colleagues as a loner and is 
known for his combative style. Since 1983, he has served as chairman of the 
Senate Business and Professions Committee, which oversees most of the state's 
professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is viewed as a "juice committee" because of the huge amount of 
campaign contributions given to its members by doctors and other professional 
groups affected by the panel's actions. Prosecutors alleged that Montoya used 
his chairmanship to extort money from individuals and groups with business 
before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime former aide, Jerry Asher, testified that in the late 1970s Montoya 
shifted his focus as a legislator away from education and labor issues and 
became more interested in enriching himself. Montoya wanted to "become a 
millionaire any way he could," Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Montoya purchased 18 houses worth nearly $2 million. Most of 
them were rental units and some were managed by Montoya's secretary in his 
Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
It will now be up to the Senate to decide whether Montoya should serve out the 
rest of his term, which expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Constitution, the Senate is the sole judge of the members of 
its house and can expel a member on a two-thirds vote, according to legislative 
counsel Bion Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our opinion that if a member of the Legislature is convicted of a felony 
while in office, the conviction would not result in automatic forfeiture of the 
office," Gregory said in a Jan. 9 opinion obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Although a felon who is in prison or on parole is prohibited from running for 
office, the restriction would not apply to a legislator who already has been 
elected, Gregory concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no provision of the California Constitution which in general makes 
conviction of a felony a disqualification for membership in the Legislature," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only five members of the Legislature have ever been expelled, state records 
show. Four members of the Senate were expelled in 1905 for accepting bribes of 
$350 each from an agent for a building and loan company. In 1850, another 
senator was expelled after he was absent for more than 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The last legislator convicted of corruption charges was Republican Assemblyman 
G. Delbert Morris of Los Angeles, who was found guilty of perjury in 1955 in a 
scandal over the selling of state liquor licenses. He resigned his seat, spent 
two years in prison and was later pardoned by Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Lyon, a one-time Assembly Speaker and Beverly Hills Republican, was 
found guilty of bribery and conspiracy in 1954 for his role in the same liquor 
license scandal. His term expired before the Assembly had the chance to 
consider the question of expulsion. He served two years in prison and was later 
pardoned by Gov. Goodwin J. Knight.

BRADLEY ALLY GOT POVERTY FUNDS FOR PRIVATE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTIN; RICH CONNELL, ; TRACY WOOD, This article was reported by 
Times staff writers Glenn F. Bunting, Rich Connell and Tracy Wood. It was 
written by Bunting. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop H. H. Brookins, a longtime Los Angeles church leader and political 
mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, obtained $336,000 in federal poverty funds through 
a city agency to renovate a run-down office complex that he secretly owned in 
Southwest Los Angeles, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The government loans were awarded to a non-existent church corporation created 
by Brookins, records show. City officials now say the funding would not have 
been approved if they had known that the bishop owned the property. 
</P>
<P>
When Brookins failed to make payments on the government loans three years ago, 
a top Bradley aide asked two city administrators to use their positions to help 
Brookins with his financial problems, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The building housed a program, headed by Brookins, that offered job training 
and education for poor residents of South Los Angeles. Through what city 
officials thought was an official church corporation, Brookins received a 
$336,000 interest-free loan to renovate the structure. The money came from 
federal funds intended to assist neighborhood projects, including poverty 
programs. But after a few years, the program moved from the renovated building 
to a dilapidated office next door. Brookins then leased the renovated building 
for $10,000 a month to a private trade school, and netted $250,000 when he 
refinanced the improved structure. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the bishop personally owns the office complex, which loan records 
indicate is worth about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins, an influential black leader, served as the Los Angeles region bishop 
for the 2.2-million-member African Methodist Episcopal Church from 1976 until 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
He was awarded the $336,000 through the Los Angeles City Council between 1982 
and 1985, and the loans were administered by the city's Community Development 
Department (CDD). He repaid the principal owed on the loans in 1988, and the 
city forgave $50,000 in back interest. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the jobs and education programs housed in Brookins' three-story 
building in the Crenshaw area had problems, including fraud and mismanagement, 
according to a state audit and city monitoring reports. The programs were 
headed by Brookins and backed by an additional $2 million in government funds. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office conducted a criminal investigation of the 
Brookins loan for almost two years before deciding last July to drop the case 
because the statute of limitations for fraud and embezzlement had elapsed, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 search warrant for financial records on the property alleged that 
"through fraudulent misrepresentations and transfers of property title, 
Brookins has personally financially profited. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Los Angeles 
referred the Brookins case to its regional Office of Inspector General for 
possible investigation of misuse of government funds, said HUD spokesman Scott 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Following inquiries by The Times, officials of the city Community Development 
Department said they will seek to recover tens of thousands of dollars in rent 
paid to a Brookins company by city-funded programs that he operated out of his 
own building. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody owes that money to the city," said Susan Cleere Flores, manager of 
the city unit that oversees Brookins' programs. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bradley announced plans for a series of public hearings on problems 
within city departments, starting with the CDD. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor declined requests to be interviewed about Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interview Canceled 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Brookins abruptly canceled an interview with a Times reporter in 
Washington, where he has served since 1988 as AME Church bishop for Maryland, 
Virginia and the District of Columbia region. The bishop's spokesman referred 
all questions to Los Angeles attorney J. Stanley Sanders, who said he did not 
know enough about the loan or the property to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard some of the same things you have heard" about the building, 
Sanders told a reporter. "If (Brookins) has done something with public funds . 
. . that is at the least an impropriety and at worst criminal fraud, then 
obviously that's a story." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Cecil Murray, a trustee of the Southern California AME Conference, 
told The Times recently that he was unaware that Brookins personally owns the 
property. Murray said that Brookins told church leaders in 1984 that ownership 
would revert to the church after renovations. 
</P>
<P>
After Brookins was reassigned from Los Angeles to Little Rock, Ark., in 1984, 
he maintained a residence in Bel-Air and remained active in Los Angeles 
political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, according to district attorney's investigative reports, 
Brookins used government funds to improve his deteriorating office complex and 
to pay off $30,000 in "personal obligations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked to Help 
</P>
<P>
As questions about the renovation surfaced in 1986, a pair of Community 
Development Department administrators were asked to help the bishop by William 
Elkins, a longtime special assistant to Mayor Bradley and a friend of Brookins, 
the two officials told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said in an interview Thursday that he had "no involvement whatsoever" in 
trying to influence city officials to assist Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor did not speak to anyone on 
his staff about the Brookins loan and the matter "never came to his attention" 
until after it was repaid in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas S. Ford, the former general manager of the city's Community 
Development Department, said he personally told Bradley that Brookins was under 
investigation before 1988. Moreover, Ford said he had "a heated discussion" 
with Elkins in 1987 after the mayor's aide urged him to help Brookins while the 
development department was conducting an investigation into possible fraud and 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, (Elkins) was trying to interfere with the investigation," Ford 
said. "I told him to back off and not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said he could "not recall" ever speaking with Ford about Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation continued, Elkins arranged for other CDD officials to 
waive $46,824 in back interest payments that Brookins owed the city and to 
conceal the deal from the City Council, said Harreld S. Adams, who replaced 
Ford on an interim basis in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said Elkins told him: "The mayor would really appreciate it if you could 
help (Brookins) out." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins was not authorized to speak on Bradley's behalf, Chandler said Friday. 
"The mayor did not speak with Bill Elkins or any other city employee regarding 
settlement of the loan," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins is one of several Bradley friends and supporters who have benefited 
financially from their relationships with the mayor: 
</P>
<P>
Far East National Bank chairman Henry Hwang received city deposits while 
Bradley served as a paid adviser to his bank. Bradley helped Long Beach 
businessman Allen Alevy acquire surplus city land at a time when Alevy was 
organizing fund-raising carnivals for the mayor. And Bradley allowed Mary Anne 
Singer to capitalize on her personal friendship with him to build a public 
relations business. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley remains under investigation by a federal grand jury for possible 
violations of public corruption and securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Bradley owes much of the credit for his record five terms as 
mayor to the Rev. H. Hartford Brookins, a respected civil rights leader who 
worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., served as the leading black 
community spokesman after the Watts riot in 1965 and helped shape the careers 
of many politicians, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins, 64, engineered Bradley's election to the City Council in 1963. Over 
the next two decades, Brookins served as Bradley's spiritual leader and 
chairman or co-chairman of every political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean literally, if I may, I almost hand-carried Bradley up his whole 
political career," Brookins told The Times in a 1985 interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley Administration has helped Brookins land three lucrative -- and 
highly controversial -- government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, amid protests of "cronyism" by some city officials, Brookins was 
among six prominent minority group members with close ties to Bradley whose 
lobbying and participation helped a team of developers win a $200-million 
contract to expand the Los Angeles Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins has received approximately $300,000 as an ethnic minority business 
partner in a Los Angeles International Airport concessions agreement that was 
approved in 1985 by Bradley appointees on the Airport Commission. A recent city 
audit found that Brookins, contrary to city regulations, had no involvement in 
the management or operation of the concessions business. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley Administration supported the city's loan of $336,000 to improve the 
Crenshaw property, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The building and an adjacent parking lot, located in the 4600 block of Crenshaw 
Boulevard, are the former site of Windsor University. Clark E. Parker, the 
school's former chancellor, told district attorney's investigators that in 1977 
he donated the property through Brookins to the AME Church in memory of 
Parker's late parents, reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins said in a 1985 interview with The Times that Parker "needed a tax 
write-off and psyched me into taking (the building) in the name of the church." 
Parker recently said he had no comment on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
County real estate records indicate that Parker sold the property for $210,000 
to the Southern California Conference African Methodist Episcopal Church Inc. 
(SCCAMEC). Brookins is listed in the property records as the sole corporate 
director of SCCAMEC Inc. even though the secretary of state's office says the 
entity was never incorporated in California. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned in 1988 about the non-existent church corporation, Brookins 
told the district attorney's office that he believed it had been "properly 
incorporated," investigation records show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Brookins put up the Crenshaw property as collateral to obtain a 
$250,000 loan for SCCAMEC Inc. through the Bank of Finance, a minority-owned 
financial institution whose board of directors at the time included Brookins 
and Councilman Gilbert Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins told district attorney's investigators that he spent the $250,000 on 
building improvements and an unspecified financial obligation but was unable to 
account for the expenditures, according to district attorney's reports obtained 
by The Times. He personally paid off the loan in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins then lobbied the City Council to pay for renovation of his building, 
which housed federal- and state-funded programs. The council instructed the 
Community Development Department in 1982 to provide a $238,000 loan to SCCAMEC 
Inc. with the first payment due in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The council vote was "political," and the council acted without considering any 
competing projects, said Ford, the CDD general manager at the time. "That money 
isn't there to fund friends." 
</P>
<P>
Once the contract was awarded, city administrators failed to take action when 
Brookins repeatedly refused to provide required financial information and abide 
by city regulations: 
</P>
<P>
* City officials, violating their own contracting rules, neither confirmed that 
SCCAMEC Inc. was a legitimate corporation nor required Brookins to furnish a 
list of corporate directors before issuing the loan. Thus, the city did not 
learn that Brookins personally owned the building until four years later -- 
after the statute of limitations for fraud had run out. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker said the city should have investigated the 
true ownership of the property back in 1982. "That's when they had knowledge or 
should have had knowledge" that a crime may have taken place, Licker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a serious mistake," said Roy Revelles, a CDD manager who monitored the 
contract. "I don't know where it fell through the cracks because everybody 
looked at that project." 
</P>
<P>
* When it was discovered in 1984 that Brookins had taken $30,000 from the 
government loan to pay a personal debt, CDD officials did not report the 
finding to their own investigators or the district attorney. Instead, they 
merely instructed Brookins to put the money back. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Brookins) this was not legal and I did not want to know about it," CDD 
analyst Bob Frechman wrote in a May, 1984, memo. "I cannot in good conscience 
condone or agree with this type of expenditure of federal funds." Frechman 
later advised that Brookins not reimburse the city through his personal 
checking account because "it would look unusual in eyes of an audit," according 
to the same memo. Brookins then reimbursed the city by submitting a check drawn 
on an AME Church account. 
</P>
<P>
Licker said that Brookins had "technically" embezzled the $30,000, but the 
statute of limitations had expired a few months before the city presented its 
case to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
* CDD staffers said they were ordered by superiors to let renovation work 
proceed on the Crenshaw building even though SCCAMEC Inc. had violated city 
bidding procedures. CDD analyst Arnold C. Garcia said in an interview that he 
repeatedly warned his immediate supervisors about compliance problems, but no 
one was willing to halt the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality was that (Brookins) was politically connected and the contract 
came down through those channels, and we were in a position where we had to 
implement it," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
When the project ran out of money in 1985, Brookins successfully lobbied the 
City Council to loan his organization an additional $90,500, bringing the total 
to $336,000, records show. 
</P>
<P>
City officials assigned the new contract to analyst Richard Gallegos, who soon 
discovered that Brookins had failed to provide the city with numerous 
documents, including loan papers, property deeds, articles of incorporation and 
the agency's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I smelled a rotten egg," Gallegos said. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos said that when he threatened to hold up the additional $98,000 in 
funds until Brookins conformed to the original contract, his supervisors 
ordered him to issue the money anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The CDD's current general manager, Parker Anderson, who met with Brookins to 
arrange the loan, said he had "no idea" how the bishop obtained the money 
through a non-existent corporation. "We need to go back and determine where in 
the process things went awry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CDD administrators say they first learned in 1986 that SCCAMEC Inc. did not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
In a call to Harreld Adams, Brookins asked the city to "soften" the terms of 
the loan because "the church" could not afford the payments of nearly $10,000 
per month due to start in February, 1987, Adams wrote in a memo. The bishop 
also admitted that he had acquired the Crenshaw property on his own, not 
through the AME church as city officials were led to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins' startling admission was followed by a series of phone calls to CDD 
officials from Elkins, the mayor's special assistant, according to two 
administrators who said they received the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said that Elkins contacted him at least three times between 1986 and 
1988. In each conversation, Elkins said the mayor would "appreciate" any 
assistance the department could offer in granting concessions to Brookins, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first call, in early 1986, Elkins encouraged Adams to "soften" the 
loan terms, Adams said. Adams said he later notified Brookins that the city 
would consider renegotiating the loan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Elkins pressured Adams and Ford to subordinate the city's position on 
the loan so that Brookins could refinance the property, the two administrators 
said. Ford said Elkins asked him to "lean in Brookins' favor" on the 
refinancing issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Ford rejected the request in a June, 1987 memo: "It has not been our policy 
to subordinate public funds in a way . . . which would provide a substantial 
profit to (Brookins) with no apparent public benefit." 
</P>
<P>
After being turned down, Brookins failed to make monthly payments on the city 
loan until May, 1988, when he arranged to refinance the property through a 
private lender. But the lender informed city officials that Brookins had no 
intention of repaying the $46,824 in back interest, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
That is when, according to Adams, he received another call from Elkins, this 
time to get the development department to waive the $46,824 that Brookins owed 
the city. Adams said he first had to get City Council approval -- which would 
reveal the problems surrounding Brookins' building. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor did not want that," Elkins said, according to Adams. 
</P>
<P>
CDD officials then changed the due date on the loan so Brookins would not owe 
any back interest or penalty payments, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the change, Adams said: "When the mayor's office asks us to do 
something in its executive capacity, if we can do it in a way that is not 
illegal, we will do it." 
</P>
<P>
The interest waiver was authorized by Deputy City Atty. Frank Orozco, who also 
decided that council approval was no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
Months earlier, Elkins had summoned Orozco to the mayor's office to discuss the 
Brookins matter. But Orozco said the meeting had no bearing on his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Elkins was very concerned about the effect (the Brookins case) might have on 
the mayor," Orozco recalled. "He was trying to nip it in the bud if it was a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins denied that he ever met with anyone in the city attorney's office to 
discuss Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco said that he and CDD officials decided to refer the Brookins matter to 
the district attorney's office for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In July of 1989, after almost two years of investigation, prosecutors concluded 
that the statute of limitations had expired in 1985 for the alleged fraud and 
in 1987 for the alleged embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Field, head deputy of the major fraud unit, said his office "would have 
looked deeper" into the Brookins case without the statute of limitations 
problem. "If it's a case where you can't prosecute it anyway, you don't spend 
the time."

JAPANESE FIRM OFFERS STATE O.C.-L.A. COMMUTER TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Japanese firm told state legislators Friday that it is willing to pay for a 
$30-million-per-mile, magnetically levitated commuter rail line connecting 
downtown Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando Valley in exchange for 
rights of way along freeway medians and an exclusive operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Eiji Ikeda, general manager of HSST Corp., told a joint hearing of the Senate 
Transportation and Appropriations committees here that a five-mile 
demonstration project on the Santa Ana Freeway between Santa Ana and Anaheim 
could operate within 18 months of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said the sleek, aerodynamic train would resemble a demonstration model 
used at Expo '86 in Vancouver, B.C., Canada and could move millions of 
commuters each year to urban centers and both Los Angeles International and 
John Wayne airports at speeds ranging from 60 to 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on whether financing would be available for a full, 155.6-mile loop 
around Southern California, Ikeda said, "Money is very much available in Japan, 
especially right now." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Ikeda's proposal by state and federal officials ranged from 
skepticism to cautious enthusiasm. Ikeda acknowledged that although his and 
other foreign firms have developed magnetically levitated commuter trains, 
which ride above a rail guideway by electromagnetic force, none is operating 
yet except on test tracks or at exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said that fares on a completed Southern California system would be less 
than what Amtrak charges for traveling similar distances, such as the $9 
one-way ticket price between Santa Ana and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said his firm wants to build the five-mile demonstration link in Orange 
County to "show everyone that it works." 
</P>
<P>
He added that his firm needs assurances from the state that the environmental 
clearance process would be speeded up (but not waived). In addition, HSST would 
need Caltrans' donation of rights of way along the Santa Ana, Golden State and 
San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Where medians are not available, Ikeda said, the trains could use freeway 
shoulders and air space above freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
It was environmental concerns that largely doomed a 1981 proposal for a 
steel-wheeled, high-speed Bullet Train from Los Angeles to San Diego. The HSST 
is "free of air and noise pollution, aesthetically pleasing, economical, 
reliable, safe, requires less energy consumption than other systems," Ikeda 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese proposal surprised the two senators in attendance at Friday's 
hearing -- Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, and Reuben Ayala (D-Chino), a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
After joking with Ikeda about how fast the company might be able to build a 
system, Presley said, "It's good to learn that this technology is available to 
draw on." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Presley supported the concept of a five-mile demonstration 
project and called HSST's technology "far advanced." 
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that the firm's request for speedy environmental 
clearances would be difficult to grant, but added that a successful legislative 
package he sponsored for construction of new state prisons included provisions 
that hastened the environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to go back to the experience we had with the Bullet Train," said 
Caltrans' assistant director Warren Weber. "Any proposal like this one has to 
go through the California and the federal environmental processes, since the 
highways are owned by the state and the federal government. It's plausible to 
work it out, but I'm not sure they (HSST Corp.) have studied carefully enough 
all of the bridges and overpasses that might have to be reconstructed to 
accommodate their train system." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Scolaro, Amtrak's chief administrator for government affairs, said he did 
not fully understand Ikeda's presentation but found it "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't talk about how much money it's going to take to operate the system 
after it's built," Scolaro said. "I think there's a place for both" Amtrak and 
a new commuter rail service, Scolaro said, adding, "I just don't know if he 
(Ikeda) can pull it off. It's going to be awfully difficult. It's going to cost 
an awful lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
HSST Corp. is bidding against other companies, including a German firm, for a 
$100-million, five-mile commuter rail project in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said his company is not seeking the contract for the $4-billion, Las 
Vegas-Anaheim high-speed train project because costs are expected to be higher 
than those projected by the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, a 
bi-state agency that is overseeing the privately funded effort. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ikeda said he sees his firm competing with others for construction of 
a six-city monorail system that has been proposed for central Orange County. He 
revealed that he recently met with Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young and other 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bidder: HSST Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985. Principal business is building magnetically levitated trains 
-- vehicles that hover above their tracks on a cushion of electromagnetic force 
at speeds of between 60 and 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of Japan Airlines, which began studying "mag-lev" trains in 1974 as 
an alternative to airliners. Financed by a group of more than a dozen Japanese 
companies, including Seibu Railway Co. and Hazama-Gumi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Was selected by the Wall Street Journal as one of the companies of the 1990s 
and beyond that will lead advances in technology. 
</P>
<P>
Current projects include a bid to build a five-mile "mag-lev" system in Las 
Vegas.

DRUGS, PRENATAL NEGLECT BLAMED FOR RISE IN L.A. COUNTY'S INFANT DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Infant deaths and the number of babies born underweight in Los Angeles County 
are rising dramatically, according to the latest county statistics. Experts 
trace the trend -- which is most striking among blacks -- to increasing drug 
use and shortages of obstetric and prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality rate among blacks and Latinos rose 17% in 1988 over 1987, 
while dropping 12% among Anglos. The percentage of babies born weighing less 
than 5 1/2 pounds -- a key predictor of mortality and disability -- rose 17% 
overall and 32% among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Orange County's infant mortality rate actually decreased from 7.6 
deaths per 1,000 live births in 1987 to 6.8 deaths in 1988, according to Dottie 
Andrews, director of Community Services for county chapter of the March of 
Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
The rate has fluctuated between 6 and 7 deaths per thousand births for the last 
several years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal patients have trouble gaining access to prenatal and perinatal 
services at UCI Medical Center, yet the county's rate -- better than both state 
and national averages -- is credited to prenatal care that is better overall 
than in Los Angeles County, said Roberta Maxwell, senior research analyst at 
the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' numbers represent "a turn for the worse" after several decades of 
improvement, a top county health official said Friday. In the previous year's 
statistics, the infant mortality rate had dropped below the statewide average 
for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing to see things turn around like this," said Dr. Irwin 
Silberman, director of maternal health and family planning programs for the 
county. "And I think it's going to be worse in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the shift to several factors: the rise of crack cocaine 
addiction among child-bearing women, the county's syphilis outbreak, 
difficulties in getting prenatal care and, among some women, ignorance of the 
need for that care. 
</P>
<P>
In hope of addressing those problems, the March of Dimes Birth Defects 
Foundation announced in Los Angeles on Friday a national campaign aimed at 
preventing infant mortality and so-called low-birth-weight births through 
public education and changes in public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our belief that the most important thing is to get people motivated to 
get prenatal care," said Jennifer Howse, president of the foundation. ". . . 
Then we can point to the lack of capacity" in prenatal care programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Orange County's death rate for white babies was the highest, at 7.9 
per 1,000, followed by 5.9 for Latinos, 5.4 for blacks, 5.0 for Southeast 
Asians and 4.1 for other Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15,610 births to Latino women, nearly 5,000 had inadequate prenatal 
care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, mortality among Latino babies is not high, Maxwell said: "We've 
postulated there is perhaps an informal kind of prenatal care, a network of 
family and community that is not classified in our traditional sense but may in 
fact be enough to direct people with problems into the care system." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's preliminary 1988 statistics, released Friday, include the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
The overall infant mortality rate in the county rose from 8.2 deaths per 1,000 
live births in 1987 to 9.6 in 1988. Among blacks, the rate rose from 16.3 to 
21.1; among Latinos, from 5.8 to 7.5. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of babies born weighing less than 2,500 grams, or 5 1/2 pounds, 
rose from 5.3 to 6.2. Among blacks, the percentage rose from 10.4 to 13.7 -- "a 
dismaying 32% increase for black babies," Silberman said. 
</P>
<P>
One in four pregnant women in Los Angeles County did not begin prenatal care in 
the crucial first trimester of pregnancy. The rate is more striking among 
minorities -- 37% for Latino women and 32% for black women. 
</P>
<P>
Babies born to mothers who receive no prenatal care are four times as likely as 
others to die during the first year of life, specialists say. The infants are 
three times as likely as others to be born weighing less than 2,500 grams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have two challenges here," said Wendy Lazarus of Children Now, a 
statewide advocacy and policy group. "One is to make sure there are open doors 
for those women who want to get prenatal care. . . . The second is to really 
reach out in those communities."

<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested a man on suspicion of murdering a young woman 
outside her home Friday by deliberately ramming his car into her car, which 
moments later burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
Ghaffari Hossein, 34, who told deputies he was from Canada, was arrested about 
four hours after the collision when deputies found him trying to hitch a ride 
at an intersection near the victim's Laguna Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said there was a "strong 
odor" of a flammable substance inside the victim's vehicle. He added that the 
car's fuel tank was intact, but he would not confirm whether Hossein is 
suspected of igniting the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Olson also would not release the victim's name or age. Friends of the victim 
would identify her only as "Manija," and said she was in her mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were trying to determine a motive. The incident occurred about 9 
a.m. as the victim was leaving for work. 
</P>
<P>
Olson alleged that Hossein parked his 1978 Toyota in a lot across from the 
woman's home in the 25000 block of Via Lomas and waited for her to get in her 
car, which was parked on the two-lane street. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he accelerated at a high speed and hit her vehicle, knocking it over the 
curb onto the lawn in front of a residence," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene, a quiet condominium complex, dozens of sheriff's deputies spent 
hours sorting through a mass of burned wires in the woman's Honda sedan and 
through the mangled yellow car driven by her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses interviewed at the scene said the woman's brother, unable to rescue 
her from the burning car, tried frantically to douse the flames with a garden 
hose. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just crying (while) trying to put the fire out," said Rick Amato, who 
spotted the car engulfed in flames as he drove down Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people standing around the car, and they could have saved 
her, but everyone was afraid that the car would blow up," Amato said, adding 
that neighbors could not understand the brother's cries for help because he was 
speaking in a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the victim and her family were Iranian immigrants who spoke 
little English and who had lived in the home for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were tipped off to Hossein's whereabouts, near the corner of Alicia 
Parkway and Paseo De Valencia, by witnesses who said they saw a bleeding man 
fleeing on foot from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"He was running up the middle of Alicia Parkway, trying to wipe the blood off 
his face with a towel," Amato said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a bloodied jacket on the lawn in front of the woman's home 
and bloody fingerprints on the entry gate, as well as a bloodied towel, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Hossein is being held in the jail ward at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for 
treatment of minor injuries, Olson said. An autopsy on the victim is scheduled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Friday, more than a dozen friends and relatives of the victim 
gathered outside the family home to console one another. Most declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the victim's brothers, who arrived late Friday afternoon from the 
central California coastal community of Santa Maria, burst into tears when 
friends described the events that killed his sister. "I can't talk right now," 
he said, wiping his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know anything except that she was on her way to work," said family 
friend Tom Bulgari.

A bitter contract battle between the Ocean View School District and its 
teachers' union has jeopardized science fairs in six of the district's schools 
and could cost pupils a chance to participate in prestigious county and state 
fairs, officials on both sides of the negotiations said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Science teachers who in past years have coached pupils to county and state 
science honors are declining to participate in this year's school-level 
contests, arguing that they will not donate any time to school-related matters 
until the contract dispute is settled, said Dane Shepard, an Ocean View 
Teachers Assn. representative at Harbour View Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Science-fair coaching is an unpaid, extracurricular activity in most of the 
district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that we're giving all this extra time to make our district No. 1 
in the county (in science fairs), yet we're being treated like we're in last 
place," said one science teacher who has coached several first-place winners in 
county competitions but asked not to be identified. "It's our way of saying 
we're tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Shepard said the decision to boycott the science fairs was independently 
reached by science teachers and was not ordered by the union. However, he added 
that the teachers' association had no objection to a similar action recently 
taken by the district's physical education teachers, many of whom have refused 
to coach basketball and other sports during non-school hours. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott has hit both the school and district levels, Shepard said. Most, if 
not all, science teachers at Crest View, Harbour View, Marine View, Mesa View, 
Spring View and Vista View elementary schools are refusing to participate in 
school fairs, scheduled March 26-30. In addition, Ray Jones, a science teacher 
at Vista View who has coordinated the district fair in recent years, has 
declined to participate this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones, reached at the school, denied 
</P>
<P>
that his decision was related to the ongoing contract dispute. "I decided that 
I've done it for the last six years and that I needed a break from it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Wayne, assistant to district Supt. Monte McMurray, said no other teachers 
have applied to fill the coordinator's position. 
</P>
<P>
"My assumption is they are not willing to provide the district with any 
additional services," Wayne said. "It's always been an opportunity for a 
teacher who wanted to do something extra. It's a paid spot, and we've never had 
a problem filling it." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said she and Spring View principal William Lescher will coordinate the 
district fair -- scheduled April 2-4 at Spring View -- if no teacher applies 
for the job. But administrators noted that there may not be enough participants 
to hold a fair if teachers aren't available to help out with projects. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Vouga, principal of Marine View School, which has had winners in 
countywide science competitions for the past five years, said he sent out a 
letter Friday to parents, asking for volunteers to coordinate and judge this 
year's school fair. He said the fair will be canceled if parents don't respond 
by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine that I'm not real happy about this decision," Vouga said, 
referring to the science teachers' decision not to participate. "While these 
projects are done largely outside of class time, they reinforce the learning 
(children) have accumulated, and these students remember these projects for 
years to come. Without these projects, I don't believe they internalize this 
kind of learning." 
</P>
<P>
Science fair competitions are open to 7th- and 8th-graders. The science teacher 
who asked not to be identified said the children sometimes spend up to four 
months constructing their projects, doing most of the work at home. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if pupils were being unfairly used as bargaining chips in the contract 
dispute, the teacher said: "I prefer not to comment on that," but added that 
the teachers' contract demands will benefit the children in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too bad that education has come to this," the teacher said. "We're 
actually being forced to play games." 
</P>
<P>
Vouga said that while he "can't say that the students are being used . . . I do 
raise questions about withholding any instruction or help for students based on 
teacher disagreement with the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Shepard, however, noted that the measures are necessary because Ocean View 
teachers "have been put down so long in comparison with other school 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
"We're notifying the parents that this (contract dispute) is affecting the 
teachers," he said. "Morale is at a crisis level, and this thing has got to be 
settled. (The dispute) is going to affect teaching in this district, no matter 
how you cut it." 
</P>
<P>
Talks are deadlocked over health benefit issues, use of funds from the state 
lottery earmarked for education, and teacher participation in the 
decision-making process, Shepard said. A new round of negotiations is scheduled 
Tuesday.

GOING OUT ON A LIMB TO SAVE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Ross Street in front of Doug Gillen's house used to look like a 
tree-lined tunnel. But then, Gillen says, the city's tree trimmers arrived last 
week with chain saws in hand and made the 70-year-old trees look like celery 
stalks. 
</P>
<P>
"You leave in the morning from your tree-lined street and you come back in the 
evening and you say, 'What's that? What happened?' " said Gillen, 43, a 
production manager for an Irvine medical-equipment company. "It's like night 
and day." 
</P>
<P>
Gillen, a 14-year resident of Santa Ana's Wilshire Square district, joined a 
small group of his neighbors in complaining to city maintenance officials that 
the majestic cedar deodar trees were being trimmed much too severely. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton Jones, a senior maintenance supervisor for the city's Public Works 
Agency, says that the trees need to be trimmed to maintain healthy growth and 
keep dead limbs from breaking off and falling on someone. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want a lot of breakage," said Jones, who has been in the 
neighborhood to explain the trimming to residents. "You don't want them blowing 
over. It's too valuable of a tree to lose." 
</P>
<P>
All 252 trees in the Wilshire Square neighborhood are scheduled to be trimmed, 
including the deodars, Jones said. Since the deodars are trimmed only once a 
decade because of their slow growth, the trimming is very noticeable, Jones 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square, about 1 1/2 miles south of City Hall, is bounded by McFadden 
Avenue, Main Street, Edinger Avenue and Flower Street. 
</P>
<P>
Guy D. Ball, 36, a five-year resident of Wilshire Square, agreed with Gillen 
that the deodars were being trimmed back too severely. The old trees lining the 
streets give the neighborhood its unique character, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the city can show that the major trimming of the deodars is necessary, 
Ball said, he won't argue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square neighbors feel strongly about their street trees, said Marc 
LaFont, co-chair of the Wilshire Square Neighborhood Assn. He woke up Thursday 
to several calls from neighbors wondering what was happening to the deodars. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come to my street and cut the deodars, I'll probably be upset," 
LaFont said. "But to be honest, they could be worse." 
</P>
<P>
Gillen said his biggest complaint is that city workers trimmed the deodars 
without taking into account the aesthetic value and character that they give to 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A brochure printed by the neighborhood association to boost the image of 
Wilshire Square even mentions the beautiful shade trees. Now, Gillen said, "It 
kind of makes our brochure on the neighborhood looking like an urban forest 
laughable."

SYMPOSIUM TARGETS VIOLENCE BY GANGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The groundwork for a citywide task force to combat gang violence by providing 
incentives for teen-agers to stay out of gangs was established at a symposium 
sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A wide spectrum of about 20 community members, including youth counselors, 
former gang members, school district representatives, local residents and the 
police, met to discuss their concerns about the increasing amount of gang 
activity and possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids are bored, with nothing to do, they conjure up something exciting," 
said Phil Aguilar, a former gang member and current pastor of Set Free 
Christian Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
The group discussed the changing scope of gang activity in the city. It has 
expanded from a few specific areas in the past to its now widespread 
involvement in a number of neighborhoods. Police Department reports presented 
at the meeting estimated a 50% increase in gang involvement from 1988 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all members of the group said that offering young people alternatives 
to gang activity was the best way to prevent gang involvement. Most also agreed 
to meetings between the youths and former imprisoned gangsters who have now 
shunned gang life style. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me they're in a gang because that's all they know," said Veronica 
Chavez, a counselor at Turning Point, about many of the youths with whom she 
works. "It takes someone else to come in and teach them alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
The group established an informal network with plans to convene again when 
members are ready to put the ideas into concrete projects. LISA MASCARO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actors, athletes and rap musicians will parade down Main Street and Civic 
Center Drive today to commemorate the contributions that blacks have made to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th annual Black History Parade boasts comedian Robin Harris as grand

The parade begins at 10 a.m., heading south on Main Street from 15th Street. 
Entrants will turn west on Civic Center Drive and complete the one-mile route 
by noon at the Santa Ana Stadium where awards will be given to floats. The 
theme of the parade is "History, Heritage and Honor." 
</P>
<P>
"Why should somebody go? To see the beautiful parade," said Helen Shipp,

GROUP TO FIGHT MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER and ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newly formed coalition of residents opposed to spraying malathion to control 
the Mediterranean fruit fly plans to demonstrate next week outside the Board of 
Supervisors chambers, group leaders announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Orange County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying, a grassroots 
group of residents from 10 cities, will also attend the board's Tuesday 
meeting, along with medical and scientific experts opposed to the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a groundswell movement all across Orange County," said Bob Taylor, a 
spokesman for the organization, which formed Thursday night. "We're going to be 
out there in force. We see this as a real showdown." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and others suggest that the malathion spraying represents a serious 
health threat, is an improper approach to preventing the spread of the Medfly 
and invades the privacy of residents in the spray zones. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders hope to persuade the supervisors to revoke an emergency declaration 
that has permitted the spraying. In addition, they want to pave the way for 
city attorneys from Orange County municipalities to file legal challenges to 
the next planned sprayings, scheduled for mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"They're experimenting on us," Taylor said. "Just because this is a low dose 
doesn't mean it's not harmful. . . . It's one thing to spray a few bushes in a 
selected way, it's another thing entirely to spray across whole counties." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail C. Hutton charged Friday that the 
state government is reneging on its agreement to produce witnesses for the 
city's effort to halt spraying. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Hutton noted, state Assistant Atty. Gen. Andrea Ordin pledged to 
make pilots and other witnesses available to answer the city's questions. But 
on Friday, Hutton said, she learned that the state is only going to allow the 
city to ask basic background questions of helicopter pilots and other workers 
involved in the spraying operation. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton said the city wants to learn from the pilots whether the aerial spraying 
is extending to areas that don't need to be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been told that much of the spraying is extended just as a convenience 
for the pilots," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is scheduled to argue its case in a Sacramento court Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But those legal efforts may be just the beginning. In Garden Grove, city 
officials are appealing to nearby cities and other communities to join in a 
proposed lawsuit aimed at stopping aerial application of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
City spokesman John Bushman said letters were sent Thursday to 10 neighboring 
cities -- Anaheim, Brea, Cypress, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, La Habra, Los 
Alamitos, Santa Ana, Stanton and Westminster. The letter also went to two dozen 
Los Angeles County communities that have been sprayed with the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Bushman said the cities might consider hiring an outside attorney to handle the 
suit, rather than using city attorneys.

JUDGE TO RULE NEXT WEEK ON CHALLENGE TO CAPIZZI'S APPOINTMENT AS COUNTY'S D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The two prosecutors challenging the county supervisors' appointment of Michael 
R. Capizzi as district attorney left court Friday happy that Superior Court 
Judge Eileen C. Moore had given them a thorough hearing. But they'll have to 
wait until next week to see if their bid to thwart the Capizzi appointment 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Moore took the issue under submission after hearing arguments and said she 
would have her ruling ready within a week. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright and Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef 
claim that the supervisors lacked the authority to appoint Capizzi on Jan. 2 to 
replace Cecil Hicks, who accepted a judgeship. They contend that Enright, as 
second-in-command in the office, should assume the duties until a new district 
attorney is elected on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
But the two prosecutors have no precedent in the state to back their position 
that changes to the government code since 1986 bar the supervisors from making 
pre-election appointments to fill out terms of such offices. And few lawyers in 
the County Courthouse give them any chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lot of (nerve) for a judge to go against the way the 
system has been operating," Enright said later. "But I think this judge has the 
courage to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors are joined in the suit for different reasons. Enright would 
take over running the office. He acknowledged for the first time Friday that if 
the suit is successful, it would probably propel him into the June 5 race 
against Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, who is an announced candidate in the June race, needs to win the 
lawsuit to try to slow Capizzi's campaign, which is rolling along with big-name 
endorsements and a flood of donations. Capizzi already has raised more than 
$100,000, over 10 times the amount collected by Avdeef. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi did not attend the hearing and has called the Avdeef/Enright lawsuit a 
"ridiculous" misinterpretation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Stephen H. Weiss, representing the supervisors, was no 
less blunt at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers claim that Proposition 59, passed by the voters in 1986, calls 
for elected rather than appointed district attorneys. They further contend that 
new code sections since then provide for the orderly transfer of the district 
attorney's duties to the next in line in the office -- until an election is 
held. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't have it both ways," Weiss countered to Judge Moore. "How can they 
say on one hand that the district attorney has to be elected, yet have a 
caretaker (Enright, as next-in-line) until then. He's not elected. It's 
illogical. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
But Avdeef attorney Kevin McDermott argued that the challengers' position is in 
line with the spirit of the voters' intentions in passing Proposition 59. 
</P>
<P>
The board appointed Capizzi to fill the rest of Hicks' term, which runs to the 
end of the year. The district attorney elected in June would take over Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef and Enright did not sound like underdogs in the lawsuit after leaving 
Moore's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great about it," Avdeef said. "I think she gave us a very fair 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Whichever side wins, it won't be Moore who makes the final decision. Both the 
county counsel's office and the two challenging prosecutors have vowed to 
immediately take the case to the 4th District Court of Appeal should they lose.

UC IRVINE ADDED $820 MILLION TO COUNTY ECONOMY, STUDY SAYS 
</P>

<P>
UC Irvine added $820 million to the Orange County economy in fiscal 1988-89 and 
was the county's third-largest employer, according to a December report 
released by the university's financial planning office. 
</P>
<P>
The amount is equivalent to supporting 16,400 households with an average family 
income of $49,916, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
One of nine UC campuses, UCI created 7,600 new jobs in the county from July 1, 
1988, to June 30, 1989. It reportedly has about 16,000 students and 8,500 staff 
and faculty members, with about 600 tenured instructors and 3,500 part-time 
students on its payroll. UCI also operates a major research and medical center. 
</P>
<P>
The two other major employers in the county are Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $820-million economic impact, $338 million was attributed to spending by 
the university, its faculty, staff and students, which creates an additional 
impact worth $482 million as the spending is passed on to Orange County 
businesses and individuals, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact is based on financial records from last fiscal year. 
Analysts hired by the university used the "economic multiplier" theory to 
estimate the recycling effects of direct spending on the county by businesses 
and individuals. Factors used in this theory were obtained from the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, UCI faculty and staff members were paid $236 million in 
salary and wages. About 82% of that -- $194 million -- was paid to employees 
who live in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In non-wage expenses, the university paid $158 million to vendors for goods and 
services. About 23% -- $37 million -- was sent to businesses with county 
addresses. UCI paid $72 million in building costs, of which at least half went 
into the county's economy, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The university's students also contributed to the economy, spending about $71 
million on housing, food, school supplies, transportation and personal 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Student spending also brought money from outside Orange County. About 33% of 
UCI students are from Los Angeles County, 20% are from other California 
communities, about 4% are from outside of California and about 3% come from 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Like the students, the university brings in outside money. For fiscal 1988-89, 
UCI received about 32% of its money -- $165 million -- from the state and 
acquired 10% of its money -- $53 million -- through federal research contracts 
and grants. 
</P>
<P>
UCI has an annual operating budget of $350 million. By comparison, Cal State 
Fullerton has 9,000 more students than UCI as of fall, 1989, but has an annual 
operating budget that is $242 million less. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't do too much research, they're more a university of direct 
instructions," said Roy Dormaier, assistant executive vice chancellor and the 
chancellor's chief financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have a medical school that takes a lot of money to operate," he said. 
"The two universities are apples and oranges. It would be really difficult to 
compare the two." 
</P>
<P>
Dormaier added that about half of UCI's budget goes to the university's medical 
center.

UCI PROFESSOR RETURNS, SAYS ARMENIANS FEAR MASSACRE;

As friends called Friday to welcome him home, UC Irvine assistant chemistry 
professor V. Ara Apkarian answered their questions with a mix of sadness and 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I got out," he would say, brow furrowing, his dark eyes growing intense. 
"But it's a mess. A real mess." 
</P>
<P>
Apkarian, 34, returned Thursday night from his first trip to the land of his 
ancestors, Armenia, on the Soviet Union's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
His research and chemistry lectures went well, Apkarian said. 
</P>
<P>
But he hadn't expected to visit Armenia during a time of strife, when its 
Christian militias clashed with Muslim militias from neighboring Soviet 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
During 10 days in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, Apkarian did not see any 
fighting, but nearly every day he heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
On his second night in the city, Apkarian joined 100,000 people at the city's 
central Opera Square. In bitter 20-degree weather, they stood together until 
well after midnight, trading rumors about the fighting and passing the word 
that in the border city of Baku, Armenians had been massacred -- tossed from 
windows, burned alive. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, he said, the mood was one of "utter desperation, a feeling of 
complete abandonment by Moscow and the world" -- as well as fear that "any day 
a massacre could start" in Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
Apkarian also watched as, again and again, bands of residents armed themselves. 
In one case, Apkarian recounted, a group of men stopped a Yerevan police 
officer and "demanded he give them his gun -- and he did." 
</P>
<P>
He also watched, sometimes taking pictures, as young men with hunting rifles 
gathered at central points around the city and prepared for a march on the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
As a U.S. visitor, Apkarian stood out, so "lots of people came up to me," he 
said, "saying the one thing I could do was to send arms." He refused but 
usually added "that I could sympathize with the need for self-protection." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although the atmosphere in the city was tense, teaching and 
research went on as usual at the University of Yerevan, where Apkarian lectured 
on solid-state lasers and the photo dependency of solids. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Apkarian said, he set up the beginnings of an exchange program between 
Armenian scientists and U.S. scholars, a project he had long planned. 
</P>
<P>
Still, reminders of strife were always there. The night before he left, 
Apkarian said, he heard plane after plane landing at the airport, bringing what 
turned out to be 6,000 Soviet troops to Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
And when he finally left Yerevan on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow on Jan. 19, he 
was one of 25 people who didn't have a seat. He had paid for his ticket, 
Apkarian said, but some of the other extra passengers, he suspects, "were 
people trying to get out . . . running for their lives (from the threat of 
bloodshed, and) had bribed their way onto the plane." 
</P>
<P>
A sympathetic stewardess found room for him and 11 other passengers by "sending 
us down the food elevator into the food preparation area of this Airbus. I 
moved some tin cans and sat on them" all the way to Moscow, Apkarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Before returning to California this week, Apkarian spent another 10 days 
researching and lecturing at the University of Jerusalem. He talked to Israeli 
scientists about the Armenians' plight but was surprised to find little 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got out (of Armenia), the world had its attention on the bigger issues. 
They weren't interested on a little skirmish in Armenia," Apkarian said.

CORONA DEL MAR'S WILLARD CHOOSES CAL; EL TORO'S CUTTRELL COMMITS TO OREGON

Jerrott Willard, a linebacker at Corona del Mar High School, said Friday he has 
made an oral commitment to attend California. 
</P>
<P>
David Cuttrell, an offensive lineman at El Toro, has made an oral commitment to 
attend Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The first day recruits can sign a letter of intent is Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, 6-feet-2 and 215 pounds, visited Cal last weekend and canceled a trip 
to Oregon this weekend. He also turned down scholarship offers from Cal State 
Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough deal," Willard said. "Cal wanted me to decide on it pretty 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Willard, the Southern Section Division VI player of the year, showed his 
versatility at Corona del Mar. He was a linebacker by choice, but also played 
running back and also made field goals of 47, 45 and 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Willard said he will be a linebacker at Cal and expects to redshirt his 
freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
Cuttrell, 6-5 and 245 pounds, had visited USC, Cal, Iowa and Oregon and also 
was considering scholarship offers from Ohio State and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
At Oregon, Cuttrell will join Dan O'Neil and Kealii Clifford of Mater Dei and 
Mark Slymen of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon had the total package I was looking for," said Cuttrell, who expects to 
redshirt his freshman year. "It's a rising program with good academics and good 
people." MIKE REILLEY

UNITED AIRLINES PLANS O.C.-TO-SAN FRANCISCO FLIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE CARRIER AND ITS PARTNER INTEND TO INAUGURATE FOUR DAILY, 
NONSTOP ROUND-TRIPS, ALTHOUGH COUNTY SUPERVISORS STILL HAVE NOT APPROVED THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
United Airlines and its commuter partner, United Express, said Friday that they 
will begin flying four daily, nonstop round-trips between Orange County and San 
Francisco on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement caught county airport officials by surprise because it was "a 
bit premature," Airport Manager George Rebella said. 
</P>
<P>
United has been given the new flights under an interim flight-allocation plan, 
Rebella said, but county supervisors have not yet approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rebella expects that United will be able to inaugurate its new schedule 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
While that will make United the third carrier on the route, it won't increase 
total flights to San Francisco from Orange County. American Airlines on 
Thursday slashed its daily Orange County-San Francisco service to three flights 
from seven because of changes in its allocation under the interim plan. 
</P>
<P>
The new United service won't affect fares from Orange County to San Francisco, 
either. Spokesmen for United and United Express said that the two carriers plan 
merely to match existing prices. Airlines do not offer many discounted fares on 
flights originating in Orange County because the airport is heavily used by 
business flyers who don't make reservations far in advance and who prefer the 
convenience of a local airport to lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
United Express said Friday that it does plan to add one more Orange County-San 
Francisco flight on April 1, which would provide a real increase in service 
between the two airports. 
</P>
<P>
American decided to cut back its service between Orange County and San 
Francisco because, in the permanent flight-allocation plan scheduled to take 
effect Sept. 15, it will lose six slots for the smaller jets it uses on that 
route, according to Bruce Wetsel, managing director of scheduling analysis for 
the Dallas-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to keep seven daily San Francisco flights under the complex 
new rules for flight allocations, and remain subject to changes by county 
officials, Wetsel said, American decided to cut its flights from John Wayne 
Airport "to a level that we can control." 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, American has been flying only 25 daily flights from Orange 
County, down from 39 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wetsel said the carrier may eventually cut its flight total to 21 a day but 
would be using larger jets that are more profitable, carrying more passengers 
longer distances. 
</P>
<P>
Until United begins its flights next month, nonstop jet service between Orange 
County and San Francisco is now provided by American, with three flights, 
including two which are daily, and USAir, with 10 flights, including five 
dailies. 
</P>
<P>
United's San Francisco service was launched when the carrier was granted four 
new flights at John Wayne Airport under the interim plan that increases 
allocations to carriers using quiet jets. United chose to use only one of its 
new quiet-engine, Boeing 737-300s at Orange County and gave the rest of its 
increase to United Express, the commuter line that uses the United name under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are no fare-cutting carriers like Southwest Airlines using John 
Wayne Airport, United and United Express are matching existing fares on the 
route rather than discounting prices. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive tab on the new United and United Express flights will be a 
$133 round-trip fare that requires a seven-day advance reservation and has 
other significant restrictions. The standard coach fare will be $180 one-way, 
United Express spokesman Mark Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, when Southwest announced earlier this week that it would begin 
flying between Burbank and Oakland with its unrestricted, $59 one-way fares, 
United immediately said it would slash fares to match them March 1.

FROM GROCERY STORES TO COMPUTERS, CHINESE BUSINESSES FLOURISHING; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: AS MANY AS 1,500 CHINESE BUSINESSES HAVE OPENED SHOP IN ORANGE COUNTY 
AND MANY ARE NOW EXPANDING TO CATER TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE ASIAN COMMUNITY. 
</P>

When Roger H. Chen moved to Orange County seven years ago from Taiwan, he grew 
tired of making the long drive to Los Angeles just to buy Chinese groceries for 
his family. Friends who were doing the same thing were getting fed up too. 
</P>
<P>
But Chen knew a good business opportunity when he saw it. And, in 1984, he 
opened the first full-scale Chinese grocery store in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the demand was there for a Chinese grocery store and because of the 
growing number of Chinese in the county, I believed the business would be 
successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from a different culture, Chen found that starting a business in the 
United States wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, there were things I didn't know," he said. "I didn't know how to 
advertise, how to promote a business and how to get government and health 
permits." 
</P>
<P>
Because there were no Chinese business groups in the county, Chen depended on 
his friends for help. He was like many Chinese immigrants new to the county who 
needed support groups and mentors. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing this need, Chen and a few other Chinese businessmen met in 
September, 1988, and decided it was time to come together. Following the 
example of the Latino, Korean, black and Vietnamese chambers of commerce, they 
founded the Orange County Chinese-American Chamber of Commerce. The 
organization marked its first anniversary Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary goal of the chamber is to get Chinese business people together and 
find out what their needs are and help them understand other ethnic groups," 
said Alan Chiu, president of the Chinese-American chamber and vice president 
and manager of Cathay Bank in Westminster. "We wanted to unite so we could have 
a common ground and work as a group." 
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 1,000 Chinese-owned businesses in Orange County, according to 
the 1990 Chinese Community Yellow Pages and Business Guide of Southern 
California. But Jason Chu, marketing director of the Chinese yellow pages, said 
the actual number may be as high as 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction belong to the year-old chamber. It now has 70 members, but the 
group hopes to double its ranks this year by stepping up its recruiting, Chiu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can group together and meet other people." 
</P>
<P>
For most Chinese, whether they settled in Orange County 40 years ago or just 
recently, their biggest obstacle is the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the difficulties Chinese have with English, Chiu said, "Chinese 
like to work with others who strictly know their language." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Shen, a native of Taiwan and president of the Orange Insurance 
Services Inc. in Fountain Valley, remembers when he was one of only a few 
Chinese business owners in the county. At age 40, Shen said he has witnessed a 
swarm of Chinese-owned businesses within the last few years throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the Chinese population growing here. That's when you see the 
businesses grow," said Shen, who plans to join the Chinese chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Shen started his business in 1982 to provide a service he knew was needed in 
the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
Shen consults and sells insurance to Chinese clients and other groups as well. 
He initially targeted his business to the Asian community, preferring, like 
many other Chinese, to do business with his own. 
</P>
<P>
He moved his business from Westminster to Fountain Valley four years later to 
reach into other ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, there was a hard market in insurance. In order to get into 
mainstream business, I had to move into another area," he said. "I did this to 
introduce insurance businesses with Chinese-American customers. I love to 
service my Chinese customers. On the other hand, I'm flattered when the 
mainstream community can come to me." 
</P>
<P>
Shen said he lives and works in Orange County because he prefers the area to 
Chinatown in Los Angeles or Monterey Park, where there is a high Asian 
population. He believes other Chinese are moving into the county for the same 
reason. In addition to this trend, he said more children of Chinese immigrants 
are going to college and pursuing careers in high-technology fields. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese business people have made their mark in several fields, but some of the 
biggest success stories have come in computers. The county's two biggest 
personal computer companies have Chinese founders or co-founders. Tom Yuen, 
chief operating officer and a co-founder of AST Research in Irvine, is a native 
of China. Gene Lu, president and founder of Advanced Logic Research in Irvine, 
hails from Taiwan. Both men came to the United States in their youth, went to 
college to study engineering and worked their way up. 
</P>
<P>
Another local computer pioneer is Hong Kong native Albert Wong, an AST 
co-founder who left that company last year. Earlier this week, Wong announced 
that he is starting a new computer company called AMKLY Systems in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
These businessmen were among the first wave of Chinese who came to study in the 
United States or emigrated here with their families. Researchers say that 30 
years ago, there were only 444 Chinese in the county. That number has grown to 
an estimated 20,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first Chinese immigrants to start a business in Orange County was 
Fred Lau, who opened the Santa Ana Food Market in 1949. Lau, 78, president of 
the Chinese Grocery Assn. of Southern California, has seen many changes in 
Orange County and is excited about the growing number of Chinese business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Lau, who lives in Santa Ana, said he is interested in becoming a chamber 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know many Chinese business people because most of my customers are 
Hispanic. So, I would like to become involved with the chamber," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a culture in which women traditionally have been kept out of top positions 
in business, some Chinese women are bending the tradition in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Yuen, owner of Madame Yuen's, a cosmetic and handbag shop, said she 
chose to open her store at the Asian Garden Mall in Little Saigon 2 1/2 years 
ago because of the large Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her customers are Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is OK because I can talk lots of languages. My customers like me," 
said Yuen, who speaks Mandarin, Vietnamese and several Chinese dialects. "I 
would like to open another shop outside the Asian community and maybe sell 
purses and handbags. I want to do this because it makes a lot more money and 
it's easier." 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, Chen, owner of TAWA Supermarket Inc., a chain of grocery 
stores in Orange and Los Angeles counties, said there are many benefits to 
uniting as a group. But, he said, to expand and to understand other minorities 
and non-minorities, Chinese business owners must be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much communication between Chinese and non-Chinese," he said. 
"But, I think that will improve. That's very important for businesses."

COMP CARE SELLING IRVINE BUILDING

<TEXT>
<P>
Comprehensive Care Corp., the troubled owner of a chain of drug and alcohol 
treatment centers, said Friday it had agreed to sell its former corporate 
headquarters in Irvine for $9 million to an unidentified buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Care said last year it would move to Missouri and sell most of 
its assets in California in order to pay a pressing $25-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement came shortly after a deal to merge with a Virginia hospital 
company fell through in October when the hospital's lender backed out. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Care said in a statement that the sale of its two-story building 
at 18551 Von Karman Avenue depends on the results of a test for environmental 
contamination demanded by the buyer, a test not yet complete. The buyer has put 
down a $500,000 deposit, but the company says the sale also depends on the 
buyer raising the rest of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Care operates the CareUnit Hospitals for drug and alcohol 
treatment, among other businesses.

PICTURE IT: SOVIET TV NEWS TO AIR IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: VIEWERS WILL GET TO SEE HOW FREE GLASNOST REALLY IS. COUNTY'S PBS 
STATION WILL SHOW THE GOVERNMENT-PRODUCED PROGRAMS BEGINNING FEB. 12.

<P>
The Soviets, or at least their television news broadcasts, are coming to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
KOCE Channel 50, the county's Public Broadcasting Station, announced Friday 
that it will air "Vremya," the Soviet Union's official, government-produced 
nightly newscast, weeknights at 11:30 beginning Feb. 12 for a two-week trial 
run. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for WGBH in Boston, which is coordinating the broadcasts, said they 
will be delivered by satellite to about 30 U.S. markets the same day they are 
aired in the Soviet Union and will carry English-language, voice-over 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
The WGBH official thinks the number of channels carrying the program may grow, 
but at this point, KOCE may be the only place where Southland viewers can catch 
Vremya. Spokesmen for KCET in Los Angeles, KPBS in San Diego and KVCR in San 
Bernardino all said that there is now no room on their stations' schedules to 
accommodate the program. 
</P>
<P>
Vremya -- which means "time" in Russian -- is said to be the most-watched 
newscast in the world, seen by 150 million people each night in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is an opportunity to experience the Soviet Union and the world 
through their eyes," said Roberta Smith, KOCE's programming director. "With all 
the monumental changes taking place in the Soviet Union, it should have quite 
an impact on the viewers to see how the Soviets view themselves, uncolored 
through the U.S. press. It's a fascinating window." 
</P>
<P>
Although some may consider it an anachronism, or an outrage, for a Soviet news 
broadcast to be shown in such a bastion of conservatism as Orange County, 
Armando Ruiz, president of the Coast Community College District Board of 
Trustees which holds KOCE's license, is not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an opportunity to provide a service to the community and 
have the community react to that," Ruiz said. "(Channel 50 is) a public 
service, which does not advocate anything, but just shows programs for the 
educational value they have." 
</P>
<P>
Vremya is being made available free to PBS stations by International Video 
Broadcasts Inc. in Fairfax, Va., which has an agreement with the Soviet, 
state-controlled television network for exclusive U.S. rights to its 
broadcasts. The program is translated into English by Soviet nationals working 
for IVB. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to distribute Vremya in the United States began 18 months ago, 
according to Alan Foster, executive producer of WGBH's news department. Seeking 
alternative, late-night programming for PBS stations, Foster sought to obtain 
foreign news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"(When) I began on the trail of Vremya, I learned that IVB had secured the 
rights," Foster said. "I tried again six weeks ago and found that IVB also had 
trouble finding buyers. I told them that if they could give us translated 
programs on a quick turnaround, I could deliver a core group of stations." 
</P>
<P>
(Among the buyers IVB had been able to find on its own was KSCI, a Los Angeles 
UHF independent which aired Vremya for two weeks last month. "The response was 
terrific," said Rosemary Fincher Danon, KSCI's general manager. "The cards and 
letters -- and quality of the cards and letters -- we received were far beyond 
what we had hoped for. The comments showed that really well-read people were 
watching out of a sincere interest in international politics.") 
</P>
<P>
Foster said he informed public television stations nationwide via Teletype 
Thursday that Vremya was available, and by Friday had added eight stations to 
the original list of 22. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Vremya's future on U.S. television, after the two-week trial, is 
finding a corporate sponsor. "We're looking for someone who's altruistic enough 
-- or has the self-interest -- to spend the money to have the Soviet view come 
to us and see how free glasnost really is," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said Vremya will look like U.S. newscasts. "In the same way the Soviets 
are coming around to embrace aspects of capitalism, their television is also 
reshaping," he said. "Vremya is quite a bit more sophisticated than it was six 
months ago. When the Soviets have a breaking story or an internal crisis, we 
might see some footage Western sources don't have." 
</P>
<P>
Foster rebukes suggestions that the show could be propaganda. "As long as you 
know where it's coming from, there's no way information can be dangerous. To 
those who still feel belligerent to the Soviets and still consider them 
enemies, it's important to know how the enemy thinks. Understanding people from 
another superpower makes the world a safer place."

SHELDON LASHES OUT AT PRODUCER OF GAY-ORIENTED SOAP OPERA DURING A TV FACE-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-gay Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of Anaheim and David Gadberry, producer of a 
gay-oriented soap opera being made in Orange County, faced off Friday on a 
live, nationally televised call-in talk show and, not surprisingly, sparks 
flew. 
</P>
<P>
During the show, "Nine Broadcast Plaza," which was transmitted from New Jersey 
over independent cable channel WWOR, about 1,500 viewers phoned in to answer: 
"Should a gay soap opera be allowed to air on TV?" Fifty percent said no, 49% 
said yes and 1% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Gadberry was joined on the program by Hal Cobb, a member of the cast of "Secret 
Passions," the soap opera Gadberry is targeting for public access cable. 
"Secret Passions" had its cable TV debut in New York City on Tuesday night and 
was screened at a Costa Mesa nightclub Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gadberry said he plans to submit the pilot Monday to nine Orange County 
public-access stations and to others in at least 15 U.S. cities. Public-access 
operators must air any non-commercial program (unless obscene or indecent) for 
which they have the time, according to a Federal Communications Commission 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Gadberry, who had not met Sheldon before, asserted on "Nine Broadcast Plaza" 
that his program, thought to be the first of its kind nationwide, will 
realistically portray the gay life style and will help promote understanding of 
the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing pornography," he said. Noting that there will be kissing in 
the serial, he added: "'What we're doing is not wrong; it's natural. When two 
men are in love, they kiss." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, who has waged a highly publicized campaign against homosexuality, has 
said he intends to monitor "Secret Passions" to determine whether the 
Traditional Values Coalition he heads will take action against it. So far, he 
said, he has seen only excerpts, such as one aired Friday showing two 
bare-chested men in bed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sheldon said, the program is immoral and "disgusting" and has no place 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the talk show host, Matt Laury, if he doesn't think Gadberry has the 
First Amendment right to produce anything he wants, Sheldon replied: "Do you 
want (people) to be able to promote apartheid and (a return) to slavery?" 
</P>
<P>
Children "model" or imitate "same-sex homosexual acts" when exposed to them, 
Sheldon said, raising his voice and leaning forward in his seat. Gadberry 
rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's studio audience, clapping and cheering, seemed to be as evenly divided 
as those who phoned in their opinon of the soap, which has been written about 
in TV Guide, USA Today and other media nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
From the Sheldon camp came the observation that the Bible does not tell about 
Adam and Steve in the Garden of Eden. The homosexual life style "should be kept 
(in the bedroom) where it belongs," one irate woman said. 
</P>
<P>
And from a man in the Gadberry gallery: "I'm not gay myself, but 
(homosexuality) is a part of life and people are going to have realize it."

CIRCUS VARGAS, A SHOW YOU SEE UP CLOSE, OPENS ITS COUNTY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Thursday, there was little about the Rancho Santiago College baseball field 
to make children stare in wonder or to bring a wistful smile to an old man's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Then Circus Vargas pulled into town, and in a matter of hours, the few dusty 
acres became a magical place where tigers dance, mortals fly and pratfalling 
clowns steal our hearts and worries. Billed as the world's largest big-top 
circus, Circus Vargas threw open its tent flaps last night in Santa Ana and 
will present shows at four Orange County locations through Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 21st year, Circus Vargas combines the sawdusty traditions of 
yesterday's traveling circuses with the glitter and splash of a Vegas show. 
Trained dog acts share the bill with sexy showgirls. Pachyderms parade in 
sequined coats that would have made Liberace proud. Ushers hawk popcorn, 
peanuts and glow-in-the-dark toys. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus -- its major, 
equally glitzy competitor -- Circus Vargas almost never performs in a permanent 
structure. Eleven months a year, the circus's 400 human and animal performers 
present their "Amazing Feats" under a 90,000-square-foot tent of duraskin 
polyester PVC (sorry, Grandpa, canvas is passe) pitched in fields, parking lots 
and public parks nationwide. The audience, often as large as 5,000, sits on 
portable bleachers just a few feet away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience is really a part of the show," said Cindy Miller, the group's 
national publicity director. "You're so close, you can actually see the glint 
in the tigers' eyes and the perspiration on a performer's face. You can feel 
the energy. In an arena, the audience is just too far away. We tried playing 
arenas as an experiment, and financially we did very well. But I think people 
really prefer the feeling of the big top." 
</P>
<P>
Based in Hollywood, Circus Vargas was founded in 1969 by Clifford E. Vargas in 
an effort to revitalize the dying tradition of the tent circus. The grandson of 
Portuguese circus performers, Vargas built the company from a modest traveling 
show to a multimillion-dollar extravaganza attended by an estimated 2 million 
people each year. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas died in September, leaving the circus in the hands of Jack Bailey and 
Joe Mascarello, his former vice president and general manager. The 1990 Circus 
Vargas tour kicked off in mid-January in San Diego and will travel throughout 
Southern California until May. By November, Circus Vargas will have presented 
nearly 700 performances in 100 American cities. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of this year's show include Wayne Ragen's "Big Cats"; William 
(Buckles) Woodcock and his 15 Asian and African elephants; the Vargas Clowns; 
aerial derring-do by the Quiroga Family; trapeze artistry by the Flying 
Rodogels, and the Marinellas Brothers on the "Double Wheel of Death." 
</P>
<P>
Circus people lead a fast-paced, physically demanding life, Miller said. After 
a two- to five-day stay in each city, the rigging, props, costumes and enormous 
tent must be packed into the company's 30 semitrailers and driven to the next 
location, along with the menagerie of four-footed stars. The following morning, 
the crew begins the six-hour process of raising the big top, setting up rings, 
rigging, wiring and bleachers for the evening's performance. 
</P>
<P>
At each stop, the public is invited to view the actual rising of the big top, 
which takes place between 10:30 and noon on opening day (see below for Orange 
County dates), and to ogle many of the show's animals. While the crew sets the 
stage, the performers spend their day rehearsing and catching up on personal 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend most of our time looking for markets and laundromats," said clown 
Lenny Wolen, laughing. Wolen, one of the circus' 12 clowns, has been in the 
business for more than 15 years, the last three with Circus Vargas. A former 
actor and a graduate of the Ringling Brothers' Clown College, he says he enjoys 
the "hands-on" aspect of the Vargas show. 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything in this show . . . everything but follow the elephants around 
with a shovel," he said, laughing again. "We meet and greet the people, do the 
act and the big production numbers. We have close contact with the audience -- 
we can really see their reactions." 
</P>
<P>
Wolen, who puts his age at "between 40 and death," plans to be in the spotlight 
for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no age limit in clowning," he said. "As long as you can fall down and 
get back up again, you're OK. Every year, you just put the makeup on a little 
thicker." 
</P>
<P>
"Buckles" Woodcock literally grew up in the circus. A fourth-generation 
elephant trainer, his Vargas elephants range in size from 11,000-pound Colonel 
Joe (billed as the largest performing elephant in the United States) to the 
two-ton, 5-year-old Brat. At Woodcock's command, the elephants skip, dance, 
walk on their hind legs, carry showgirls in their mouths and on their trunks, 
and in the finale, stage a pachyderm "pyramid" just inches from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize how agile elephants are," Woodcock noted. "They figure 
anything this large must be clumsy." 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock said it takes only a six-week "boot camp" to teach an elephant such 
basic stunts as lifting its trunk on command and following in a line. 
</P>
<P>
"Their intelligence is their most outstanding feature," he said. "A dog trainer 
once told me a dog that could understand eight words was a brilliant animal. 
The dumbest elephant I've ever seen understands 20 or 30 words." 
</P>
<P>
Trained animals have been a mainstay of circuses since the late 1700s, but in 
recent years, controversy raised by animal-rights activists have caused some 
members of the public to think twice about the whole practice. Woodcock, 
though, sees circus work as a form of preservation, not persecution, of the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to be saved, it's going to be in this country. Look at all 
the poaching that's going on. In the wild, Joe's ivory would be a death 
warrant," Woodcock said, referring to his star's six-foot tusks. "Plus, as 
performers, they're constantly getting mental stimulation, not like a zoo 
elephant who stares at the same four walls every day. I just wish people could 
look more at the overall picture." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ragen, who leads the shows' four Bengal tigers and four African lionesses 
through their paces, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are scrutinized so strongly by the humane societies, government agencies 
and the general public," noted Ragen, who said he prefers a more gentle, 
communicative approach in his cat training over the old-fashioned 
"tyrant-with-a-whip" approach. 
</P>
<P>
"When the cats are on display, I spend a lot of time answering people's 
questions and giving them our side of the story," added Ragen, who has been 
working with cats for 15 years. "I find there are a lot of misconceptions. 
"People never get to see exotic animals as close as they can see them here. You 
can smell them -- you're practically right next to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the parents showing them to their kids, and they're all so excited. 
Nowhere in the world can you see that except at a circus." 
</P>
<P>

17th and Bristol Streets in Santa Ana. Shows are today at 12:30, 3:30 and 7:30

screen. But don't try it on a genuine blueblood. Protocol dictates that you 
should never touch royalty unless one of them touches you first. And going on 
past record (several thousand years or so), the chances of a commoner getting a 
royal backslap are pretty remote. 
</P>
<P>
Protocol is an internationally accepted code of civility which dictates how we 
deal with each other's dignitaries -- whether we touch them, how we address 
them, where we seat them at banquets, and what we chat about with them. 
</P>
<P>
It was not so long ago that wars were being declared over mere slights and 
duels to the death were being fought over which ambassador sat where at court 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
And today's standards of international behavior are history's legacy to us. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, not much has changed. An affront to a nation's representative is 
still considered an affront to the nation itself, although seating someone 
behind a pillar is not exactly a declaration of war these days. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such diplomatic gaffes, specialists in the arcane details of protocol 
are de rigueur in the world's capitals. 
</P>
<P>
But because globe-trotting ministers of trade, members of Parliament, mayors 
and university chancellors conduct much of their official business outside 
diplomatic and political circles, states, cities, and even large corporations 
like AT&amp;T have established offices of protocol to ensure all the Ts are 
crossed when foreign VIPs come calling. The state of California has an office 
of protocol. So does the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even Orange County has one. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just a minute. Bureaucracies of pomp and ceremony in laid-back Southern 
California? Didn't we come out West to get away from this kind of starched 
ritualism? 
</P>
<P>
According to Mary Bonino Jones, Orange County's chief of protocol, how we 
choose to conduct ourselves privately is our own business. But when we are 
dealing with foreign dignitaries in an official capacity, we have no choice but 
to abide by the formalities agreed upon by the international community. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of how we feel, we still have an obligation as a government to adhere 
to the rules of protocol when relating to other governments and their 
representatives," Jones insists. As the titular head of their nation, they are 
entitled to be received in an appropriate manner, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
And like it we do. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of our weak protestations, America is a nation of unabashed 
royalphiles. Reportedly, more books on Britain's royal family are sold in the 
United States than back home on their own turf. We can't get enough gossip 
about Princess Di and Princess Stephanie of Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
And the thought of actually meeting someone -- anyone -- with a title is enough 
to make us jelly-kneed. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Rusk, clinical professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego, calls the 
phenomenon "compare and despair." As he sees it, economic status alone is no 
longer enough. We crave class, distinction. A title is one of the few things 
that can separate us from the simply rich guy who lives next door. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds if not thousands of years of tradition behind a title," he 
explains. "Money can't buy that and these people know it." 
</P>
<P>
If we can't be royalty, then rubbing shoulders with them seems the next best 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Do you curtsy, bow, or shake hands? Do you talk or wait until you are spoken 
to? What about turning your back on them as you walk out of the room? 
</P>
<P>
When royalty beckons, who ya gonna call? That's right, the office of protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1984 by the Board of Supervisors, the Orange County office of 
protocol has a sterling grip on the minutiae of when to address a duke as "your 
royal highness" and when to merely call him "your grace" (hint: a duke who is 
given the title is smaller potatoes than one, such as a member of the royal 
family, who is born to it.) 
</P>
<P>
The office of protocol's kid-glove treatment has been extended to the crown 
prince and princess of Luxembourg and to the king and queen of Sweden (who came 
to Orange County as private guests of Henry and Renee Segerstrom). 
</P>
<P>
And in an unequaled public relations coup, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled 
spiritual leader, was in town on the day the world learned that he had been 
awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county provides the three-man protocol team with free office space 
in the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana and absorbs telephone charges, the 
office of protocol is funded through the efforts of its support arm, the 
Protocol Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Membership dues from about 350 private and corporate supporters provide the 
bulk of the annual operating budget (estimated at $104,500 for 1989-90). The 
balance is raised at the annual and very formal International Protocol Ball. 
</P>
<P>
This year's gala, being held tonight at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach, is 
expected to raise about $40,000. Four hundred guests have paid $150 each to 
attend the ball and hobnob with 40 members of the consular corps. Those who 
paid $1,500 to sponsor an entire table will have the consul general of their 
choice as their guest of honor during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic to the end, the ball's organizers decline to divulge which consuls 
general are snapped up first, but rumor has it that those representing the 
Pacific Rim countries, Orange County's major trading partners, are among those 
most sought. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to business networking, ballrooms are not off limits. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the very people who arrange galas for the international A-crowd 
work out of a cramped, windowless office filled with dowdy furniture and 
secondhand equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Jones gingerly admits that her team is working under "some rather constraining 
conditions." The annual budget barely covers three salaries, office supplies 
and printing costs. The staff members go next door to the county information 
office when they need to make photocopies, they rely on volunteers to pad out 
the manpower and, as Manager of Protocol Services Pat Ware put it, "We shop 
around for the best deals on office supplies. It's always a bit of a scramble." 
</P>
<P>
Royalty, heads of state and grandees make up the smallest percentage of 
official visitors who come to town for the Tour d' Orange, she explains. The 
VIP roster runs more to trade attaches, ministers of finance and government 
specialists in technology, science, business and education who come, as 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder puts it, to learn about the business of doing 
business with Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the protocol office was never intended to be social," says 
Wieder, who pushed for the creation of the office while board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had called it the International Economic Board, perhaps people would 
understand its function better. Orange County has a larger percentage of 
employers that do business overseas than any other place in the United States. 
Believe me, these visiting dignitaries are no longer coming to see Mickey 
Mouse," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder is referring to the days when Disneyland held a virtual monopoly on the 
county's protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1984, the Magic Kingdom's well-oiled, well-financed international 
relations department had been rolling out the red carpet on our behalf for 
prime ministers, presidents and royalty, including Japan's Emperor Hirohito, 
for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Those were also the days when Orange County's international profile could have 
been summed up in six words: "Orange County? What's that? Oh, Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the office of protocol's mandate is to do something about that image. 
</P>
<P>
The county's booming international economy has already made some headway in 
pulling us out of global obscurity. But the decentralized nature of the county 
makes it hard for foreigners to understand exactly what kind of economic and 
political entity that they are dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has 2.25 million people and 29 cities, but we don't have a 'key 
city' where an office of protocol is traditionally located," Jones explains. 
</P>
<P>
"Every township in the world has a mayor and visitors are familiar with the 
cultural significance of the mayor's position. But a Board of Supervisors is 
hard to explain. It's an interesting challenge to impress our visitors with the 
importance of the board." 
</P>
<P>
Jones could certainly teach us all a thing or two about the fine art of 
diplomatic small-speak, which she mastered during her 15 years in international 
relations as manager of community affairs at -- where else? -- Disneyland. 
Supervisor Wieder called her "a natural for the position." 
</P>
<P>
Ask her outright if we are a county of cultural hicks and she replies: "The 
community is certainly becoming more and more knowledgeable about other 
cultures." 
</P>
<P>
The office of protocol is also the official county liaison with the region's 
consular corps. Until the office was opened, the 70-odd consulates based in Los 
Angeles and the 15 based in San Francisco viewed Orange County as an extension 
of Los Angeles at best. At worst, the county -- and its economy -- were ignored 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't get the whole picture without an office of protocol to assist 
you," says John Kelso, Australia's consul-general. 
</P>
<P>
Through its Business Relations Council, the office of protocol holds economic 
briefings for the consulates on what Orange County has to offer. The council 
also coordinates seminars and networking for local companies who either conduct 
international business or who are interested in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here as a resource for the business community," Ware says. 
"Understanding that in many countries it is important to follow a certain 
etiquette before getting down to the hard nails of business can make or break a 
company's entree into a foreign market. We have that kind of information here 
-- cultural profiles from all over the world -- at their disposal." 
</P>
<P>
That information could be as simple as knowing that when the French say 
something is impossible, it is not necessarily a statement of fact but merely a 
colorful way of punctuating negotiations. Or knowing that in Asia, where the 
exchange of gifts formalizes a business relationship, the color of the gift 
wrap is as crucial as the gift itself. While red means good luck in Japan, in 
Korea it symbolizes death. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the man in the street benefits," Wieder says. "He understands that there 
is a trickle-down effect as the county's economy is affected." More important, 
perhaps, is knowing that the office of protocol is supported privately rather 
than by his tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, not one cent of the budget is earmarked for entertaining visiting 
dignitaries. Instead, the office relies on its network of companies and private 
individuals to host the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Anderson, a realtor who doubles as president of the Protocol Foundation, 
has hosted dozens of guests from around the world at her 1 1/2-acre home in 
Orange Park Acres, including a group of Indonesian members of Parliament and 
one of the Queen's Guards, who stayed for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We also had a professor of political science from Stuttgart University stay 
with us on his way to lecture at Harvard," she says. "He had never been on a 
horse in his life, and we just happen to own seven horses." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the bespectacled academic was having the time of his life 
impersonating an Orange County cowboy. "By bringing these people into your 
home, you break all the formality," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And that, after all, is what we do best in Orange County.

IRVINE INVENTOR FINDS INSPIRATION IN THE BIZARRE, EXTREME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Malewicki would be the first to admit that some of his inventions have 
literally never gotten off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki has invented a jet-powered motorcycle, a mileage-record-setting car, 
a speed-record-setting bicycle, a popular game for kids and a car-chomping 
mechanical dinosaur that performs at monster-truck shows. 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki is a real-life version of the scientist named Szalinski, portrayed by 
actor Rick Moranis in the hit movie, "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." Szalinski 
mistakenly zapped his children to sub-insect dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you could say I related to that movie," said Malewicki, who has lived in 
Irvine for 12 years. "I'm sure some of my friends thought I was a little crazy 
with some of my first inventions." 
</P>
<P>
The jet-powered motorcycle, Evel Knievel's Skycycle, made a highly publicized 
but unsuccessful attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. Malewicki 
designed and engineered the steam-powered motorcycle that barely got off the 
ground, but rocketed Knievel to greater fame, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sham, but people started looking up to me after the association with 
Evel Knievel," Malewicki said. "Even though the project didn't work, my peers 
knew how much thought and work went into building the Skycycle." 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki has had other disappointments. Before he could claim the world 
land-speed record of 152.284 m.p.h. for a bicycle, he had perhaps the world's 
fastest flat tire on a memorable day in 1985 at the Bonneville Salt Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time U.S. Olympian John Howard was mounted on the prototype bicycle that 
featured a double-reduction gear setup and was nearing 150 m.p.h. when the rear 
tire went flat. 
</P>
<P>
"The flat tire could have killed him," Malewicki said. "There were 1,600 Gs 
(the measure of gravity against an accelerating object) on the valve spring of 
the tire. We were really worried about maintaining the balance of the bike when 
we took the tire off." 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki's most successful project, the California Commuter, never brought him 
a dime but earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. The 
prototype car got 157 miles per gallon on a trip from Los Angeles to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm most proud of that project, although it never took off," he said. "We left 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and weren't on the road 20 minutes when three 
California Highway Patrol cars pulled us over in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked to see the operating license and started asking all kinds of 
questions about the car. They must have radioed ahead the entire trip because 
every once in a while another patrol car would pull up beside us, give us a 
signal and then take off." 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki's most profitable project has been a child's game, "Nuclear War." 
Self-described as "a comic, cataclysmic card game of global destruction for 
kids of all ages," it has been a best seller for Flying Buffalo Games for 25 
years. An IBM computer version is due for release next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a $300-a-month royalty check for that game for 25 years," 
Malewicki said. "They tell me if the computer game takes off, I could get 
$50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a word-of-mouth type of game. The company tried advertising but 
found it sold more games by friends telling other friends how much fun it is to 
play. People wear the decks out and write for more." 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki's lastest project, Robosaurus, is a 40-foot-high, 56,000-pound, 
fire-breathing monster robot capable of lifting and crushing 4,000-pound cars. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, which took 18 months to build, moves freely with the aid of 
cylinders, valves, pumps, air brakes and air suspensions. A two-man crew 
strapped inside the monster's cranium controls its huge claws with fly-by-wire 
electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sound outrageous? 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki envisions his lastest creation as potentially his most profitable 
project. Investors earned $25,000 when the machine appeared at a recent two-day 
show that drew 67,441 spectators to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Robosaurus rolled onto the stadium field, lifted a junk car 40 feet, tore off 
the car's roof with its steel jaws and then slammed it to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Robosaurus is scheduled to appear in shows in Tempe, Ariz.; Toronto and 
Vancouver, Canada; Los Angeles and Indianapolis. Malewicki said he is also 
negotiating a deal with Universal Studios to produce a two-hour pilot 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first real winner," Malewicki said. "It's King Kong, Godzilla and 
Star Wars rolled into one." 
</P>
<P>
Malewicki's next project will be to build a hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle, 
capable of traveling 145 m.p.h. and as far as 100 miles per gallon. Its gas 
engine will run a generator and an electric motor in each wheel will power the 
car. Malewicki plans to build the car in Irvine and then embark on a 
cross-country promotional tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these things I've invented are crazy," he said. "But at some point, 
they become creditable and then acceptable."

The International Museum of Graphic Communication in Buena Park documents the 
evolution of the printing process and provides an enjoyable tour, especially 
for the visitor 
</P>
<P>
who has made the rounds of nearby amusement parks and is seeking something more 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a working museum," says curator Mark Barbour. "That means everything 
here can be demonstrated and visitors get actively involved in what is being 
presented to them. There is nothing more boring than looking at rows of old 
machines, so we came up with ways to make the museum lively." 
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-square-foot facility, opened in 1988, houses the personal collection 
of Ernest A. Lindner, a Los Angeles businessman who started in the printing 
business in the 1940s by reconditioning and selling used Linotype machines. 
Lindner began purchasing printing presses and other tools of the trade and 
gradually accumulated a collection that documents the progression of the 
technology through the days of hot type to today's cold-type methods. 
</P>
<P>
"But what happens here is that the visitor swallows the pill of education 
without even realizing it," Barbour says. In its presentation of the printing 
trade, the museum also provides the inescapable lessons in democracy and 
freedom that intertwine with printing's rich history. "We also touch on the 
evolution of business, of labor unions and inventing," Barbour adds. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend visitors are invited to watch a live performance in the museum's 
theater complex that makes the historical personalities of printing spring to 
life. Johann Gutenberg, who invented movable type in 15th-Century Germany, 
sings about his struggle to print the entire Bible while using his new method. 
And Benjamin Franklin tells of printing's involvement in the American 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
A restaurant and gift shop are scheduled to open at the museum within a few 
months. Future plans also include hands-on workshops in papermaking and 
hand-set printing methods. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HE AND KOVIC SHARE SAME BIRTHDAY -- AND A DISDAIN FOR VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Kovic is going to speak at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine next 
Wednesday, and I'll be there. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be accompanied by movie director Oliver Stone, who will talk about the 
making of "Born on the Fourth of July" -- the film biography of Kovic that is 
now playing in Orange County theaters and is attracting a lot of support as the 
best motion picture of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
I have a lot in common with Ron Kovic, and if I have a chance, I'd like to tell 
him. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, we were both born on the Fourth of July (I preceded him by two 
wars). And the next most important thing we have in common is the feeling we 
share that the war in Vietnam was the most grievous tragedy visited on the 
United States since the Civil War. And maybe the most grievous in U.S. history, 
since the Civil War couldn't have been avoided and Vietnam could. 
</P>
<P>
Not in a very long time has a motion picture moved me the way "Fourth of July" 
did. Its pace and message are both relentless, and I was wrung out when I left 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Stone has taken a lot of heat on both counts, but he's coming from a place his 
political critics find hard to attack. 
</P>
<P>
He was there. 
</P>
<P>
And whatever other voice he raises, his understanding and support of the men 
who fought that war is total. That makes the carping of the political right 
about his "trashing" of America something less than credible. 
</P>
<P>
But in telling Kovic's story, Stone does something that the movies have never 
attempted with any degree of depth before. He deals with the home front, with 
American attitudes about the Vietnam War that colored attitudes toward the 
returning soldiers and almost ripped this nation apart. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Fonda took the only other shot at this in a movie called "Coming Home" -- 
and she chickened out before she ever came to grips with the issue. Stone 
doesn't chicken out; he deals frontally with the schism that Vietnam caused not 
only throughout the country but within families as well. 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, he dealt with a small corner of that schism that touched me 
deeply: the philosophical problems of World War II veterans and their wives 
whose sons were of draft age during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
I know of one family in which the mother secretly supported the efforts of her 
son to resist the draft over the violent objections of her ex-Marine husband 
who castigated the boy. The father doesn't know to this day the part his wife 
played in helping their son get to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
I know another family in which the older son -- through a series of creative 
delaying tactics after college -- avoided the draft while his younger brother 
was drafted out of high school and survived 18 months of combat in Vietnam. 
There is no rancor between them on this issue today; both respect the fact that 
the other was doing what he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an ultraconservative Orange County family I knew fled to Canada and 
for three years the family was badgered by FBI agents seeking information about 
the son. By the time the war was over and amnesty declared, the boy's parents 
had changed their basic position on Vietnam and welcomed him home. 
</P>
<P>
I know dozens of such stories -- including my own. 
</P>
<P>
I had a son of draft age during the Vietnam period. Although his political and 
philosophical views were often unpredictable and not easily packaged, he was 
violently opposed to the Vietnam War and felt that the best contribution he 
could make toward ending it was to resist it in every way he could. 
</P>
<P>
His mother and I both supported him in this position, and I suppose it was our 
good fortune that he failed the draft physical because of a childhood infirmity 
-- and this cup was thus taken from us. But that experience only heightened the 
agony I felt for both the boys who went and those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
One of the prevailing myths that the supporters of U.S. involvement in Vietnam 
like to repeat is that those who opposed the war were contemptuous of the 
fighting men when they returned home. Within the limits of my experience and 
observations, that simply was not true. 
</P>
<P>
In that time of terrible confusion in this country, we all ended up following 
our own consciences, wherever they took us. No one respected that more in the 
men who went than those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The cold reception came from the great majority of Americans who managed to 
avoid any direct contact with the war at all and simply wanted it over so they 
could get back to business as usual. It was pressure from this group that 
finally ended it -- and that pressure only came about when Lyndon Johnson 
exhausted his supply of draftees who had no way of avoiding the draft and 
started getting into the ranks of the children of middle- and 
upper-middle-class parents. 
</P>
<P>
And so Vietnam continues to divide this country. Stone's critics say he has 
poured gasoline on this fire with his new film, but the fact is that we are 
never going to heal this problem by ignoring it. And now, it looks as if it is 
going to become an issue in an Orange County election. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kovic is testing the Orange County waters to see if he wants to run for 
Congress against Robert K. Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
Before you cry "carpetbagger," remember that Dornan emigrated from Beverly 
Hills to do the same thing against former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Already Dornan is heating up the Vietnam issue. Typical Dornan comment: "It is 
absurd to think that somebody would run for Congress based on a paperback book 
filled with self-pity and immoral excursions and a propaganda movie based on 
distortions and lies." 
</P>
<P>
So Dornan has already set the tone. But this time, attacks on his opponent's 
war record aren't going to carry him very far. Ron Kovic left the use of his 
legs on a battlefield in Vietnam, but his heart is intact. 
</P>
<P>
If he likes what he hears at the Bren Center next Wednesday, it may carry him 
into hand-to-hand combat with an incumbent Orange County congressman.

AGING WORLD WAR II VETERANS ARE RUSHING TO COLLECT SOME LONG OVERDUE MEDALS. 
THOSE COMBAT STORIES WERE TRUE, AFTER ALL. 
</P>

<P>
After hearing the same story for 37 years, Jean Hemenway knew it by heart. Her 
husband was a World War II hero who had dashed through machine gun and mortar 
fire during a 1945 battle in the Philippines to save a wounded buddy's life. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, Clyde Hemenway didn't have any Army medals to prove his mettle. If 
he really had done what he said, where was his Purple Heart? Where were the 
combat ribbons? And where was the medal for battlefield valor? 
</P>
<P>
"I did believe him," Jean Hemenway said. "He'd told people about it all these 
years. Not that they didn't believe him -- but there wasn't any proof." 
</P>
<P>
There is now. Two months ago, the Army awarded the 78-year-old retired Norwalk 
mailman six medals that it failed to present him 44 years ago. And officials 
say a seventh battle ribbon is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Hemenway is among thousands of World War II veterans who are rushing to get the 
military to present them with wartime commendations they earned but never 
received. Former soldiers applied for 400,000 forgotten World War II ribbons 
last year, according to Army officials. That was 60% more than the number of 
requests received just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Army officials say they ran out of medals when the war ended and they were 
caught in a crush of GIs being discharged. Soldiers hurrying home from 
battlefields in Europe and the South Pacific were told they could pick up their 
medals later. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, many of the servicemen were too busy establishing families and 
civilian careers to bother. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, ex-GIs who have reached retirement age have the time -- and the 
inclination -- to track down their awards. And military officials are hurrying 
to catch up with the crush of requests. 
</P>
<P>
The medals are shipped from an Army warehouse in Philadelphia, not far from the 
Liberty Bell. Officials at times have worked around the clock to fill the 
requests. There is a four-month backlog now, said Larry Smith, acting chief of 
the medals distribution office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot guys now want their medals as a legacy for their children or 
grandchildren," Smith said. "Some of the requests are from elderly people who 
are ill. We try to expedite them." 
</P>
<P>
An Army records office in St. Louis that checks out each request for a medal is 
six to nine months behind in its work, said Gladys Maeser, an Army spokeswoman. 
The verification job has been complicated by a 1973 fire that damaged or 
destroyed 80% of all World War II records. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials predict that they will see new surges in medal requests as 
servicemen who fought in Korea and Vietnam grow older. But they point out that 
fewer Americans were called to duty in those conflicts than in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has already shipped out thousands of Vietnam War medals. "Most of them 
are first-time issue" and not replacements, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys have told me they didn't want them back then, when they got 
out. But later on, they've thought about what they went through, or now their 
kids want to see their medals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials say their policy is to try to quickly and ceremoniously 
award commendations to servicemen involved in the infrequent combat operations 
of today. 
</P>
<P>
The Army temporarily ran out of Combat Infantryman Badges when it started 
awarding them to soldiers involved in battles during December's invasion of 
Panama, said Kathleen Ross, an Army spokeswoman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of some veterans of World War II, however, the only uniform they 
see when they finally do receive their medals is that of the U.S. Postal 
Service. The awards are simply mailed, as in Hemenway's case, unless advance 
arrangements have been made with the Army or a congressional office. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Army will arrange for an Army Reserve officer to present 
the medals if requested. "If they ask, we try to accommodate them. It's an 
honor they deserve," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
"More children now are getting involved. Their parents are getting older and 
they want to make sure they get tributes and honors and feel special," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Douglas Pence, a Marine Corps spokesman in Los Angeles, said 
former Marines are referred to a "decorations and awards" office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"People lose track of time," said Christina Johnson, a Navy chief journalist 
whose Los Angeles public affairs office refers ex-sailors' medal inquiries to 
Washington. "Older guys are trying to tie up loose ends." 
</P>
<P>
Former Army airborne trooper Tony Marincola, 72, of Canyon Country, received 
eight overdue medals three months ago. He said he was not told of the awards he 
had earned when he left the service in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're first discharged, you're young and you don't care what happened," 
said the retired tool supervisor. "But as you get older, your children ask 
about the war and whether you got any medals." 
</P>
<P>
Marincola has placed his awards in a display cabinet, including a Purple Heart 
belatedly received for a wound suffered in the Battle of the Bulge. "My two 
daughters are real proud of me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Army Ranger Frank Romero, 71, of Canoga Park, also received eight medals 
after sending copies of his military records to the Army last year. The retired 
truck driver said awards were not discussed when he was liberated after 
spending 16 months as a German prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
He had told his three children about his wartime experiences. "Now they know," 
Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with seven World War II medals, Bill Buckman, 67, of Chatsworth, was 
surprised when he received four others for duty in Korea after asking Army 
officials to check his records. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it was the way you were interviewed at the time of your discharge. 
They didn't have access to my records at the time. And part of it was just my 
memory," said Buckman, a retired electrical engineer now involved with American 
Legion work. 
</P>
<P>
Sigurd Carlson, a 62-year-old retired high school teacher from Studio City, 
said that several of the five medals he recently received from the Marine Corps 
"weren't made yet" when he was discharged in 1946 after fighting in four major 
South Pacific battles. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes my family feel good. It's something you can leave them," said 
Carlson, who now works with veterans at the VA Hospital in Sepulveda through a 
service organization called AMVETS. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson has helped other veterans with the paper work required to collect their 
medals. One of them, former Marine George Hatzadakis, received seven awards. 
</P>
<P>
"There was awe in my two daughters' faces when they saw them," said Hatzadakis, 
a former county auditor's investigator who has retired to the Greek island of 
Crete but is currently visiting Los Angeles. "I'm going to fix them up in a 
display and let them fight it out over who gets them." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Hemenway said he started writing letters to officials about his missing 
medals two years ago. "I decided my grandchildren might like to see them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to finally get them. Of course, it would have been better if I'd had 
them when I came home from overseas. Back then, everybody was talking about the 
war being over. Everybody was interested in what you'd done." 
</P>
<P>
His awards include a Purple Heart, Bronze Star and Good Conduct Medal and 
American Campaign, American Defense, Asiatic Pacific Campaign and Victory 
battle ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
The Purple Heart and Bronze Star were awarded because of his actions as a 
33-year-old Army medic on May 12, 1945. His rifle company was involved in a 
five-hour battle in Manigima Canyon, on the Philippine island of Mindanao. 
</P>
<P>
"I went after a wounded rifleman. He was bleeding very badly and I knew he 
didn't have all day," Hemenway recalled. "Machine-gun bullets were hitting the 
ground on both sides of me when I ran about 25 yards to him. I got hit in the 
back by a mortar fragment. I dragged him behind some grass to patch him up. He 
had seven or eight machine-gun holes in him." 
</P>
<P>
The soldier, named Snyder, survived his wounds. So did Hemenway -- who 
remembers being grateful just to be alive when he shipped home five months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd spent the last eight months in a rifle company and not once had I gone 
after a wounded man and not drawn fire," he said. "As a kid, I had never been 
the hero kind. I would never climb as high in the tree as the other boys. But 
here I was, doing it." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to proudly show his medals to his 10 grandchildren at a family reunion 
on Sunday. He expects to have to explain to the youngest of them what World War 
II was. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather used to talk about the Civil War when I was a boy and I thought 
that was ancient history," Hemenway said with a grin. "So many people today 
didn't live through World War II. To them, that's ancient history."

DELAY SOUGHT IN DEMAND FOR REAGAN DIARIES

The Justice Department, seeking to avoid a "constitutional confrontation," 
asked a federal judge late Friday to delay the deadline for former President 
Ronald Reagan to turn over parts of his diaries dealing with the Iran-Contra 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene had ordered Reagan to turn over by Monday 
portions of his personal diaries to lawyers for John M. Poindexter, who was 
Reagan's national security adviser when the scandal broke in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter faces five felony charges and is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
In its motion, the Justice Department asked for more time to develop a 
"stipulation" of facts with independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh that could 
eliminate the need to introduce sensitive national security information in 
court. At the same time, the department said attempts to agree on a stipulation 
had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Asking for more time to conduct negotiations, the government said: "We firmly 
believe that such an order is likely to obviate any need for the diary entries 
to be disclosed. The court will thereby avoid a possible constitutional 
confrontation and the serious potential for delay such a confrontation would 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has resisted attempts to require him to turn over documents or to 
testify at the trial of Poindexter, who told congressional investigators that 
he kept Reagan in the dark about many parts of the secret deals to aid the 
Nicaragua Contras. But Poindexter plans to argue that his actions in the 
scandal were authorized by Reagan.

A worldwide alert was issued to booksellers and antique dealers Friday asking 
them to look out for a bark manuscript of notes on Capt. James Cook's Pacific 
voyages, an Australian museum curator said. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-page book, including Cook's notes on three of his voyages to the Pacific 
in the 1770s, was stolen from the South Australian Museum in December last 
year, said the museum's curator, Philip Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said police investigations have so far been unable to trace the stolen 
book, valued at $77,000.

CHINA LASHES AT U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS 
</P>

<P>
China on Friday strongly condemned recent approval by the U.S. Congress of 
economic sanctions against Beijing, lodging a formal protest with U.S. 
Ambassador James Lilley, according to the official New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Congress . . . has willfully trampled on the basic norms governing 
international relations and wantonly interfered in China's internal affairs," 
Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu said in the protest, the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Liu declared that "certain U.S. congressmen, addicted to bias and disregarding 
the realities, have readopted the amendment on sanctions against China. This 
can only reveal their stubborn anti-China position." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation calling for economic sanctions in response to Beijing's bloody 
suppression of last spring's pro-democracy protests originally was approved in 
November. But the wide-ranging bill containing the sanctions was vetoed by 
President Bush for reasons unrelated to China, and the sanctions were approved 
again in legislation passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation blocks the export of military and crime-control equipment, 
suspends nuclear energy cooperation and imposes certain restrictions on trade 
and economic relations. Bush already had imposed similar economic sanctions 
last June, some of which he has since eased. The new legislation is largely 
symbolic, because it allows Bush to waive sanctions if he deems it in the 
national interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese protest, while described by Liu as an expression of "utmost 
indignation," also declared that the sanctions would fail. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people highly value their hard-won independence and sovereignty 
and have never yielded to any outside pressure," Liu told Lilley, according to 
the news agency. "They have withstood economic blockades, overcome numerous 
difficulties and found and kept to a road of development suited to the actual 
conditions of their country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Facts will prove that those members of the U.S. Congress, by their anti-China 
actions, are just like lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet. In the 
end, it is the interests of the United States itself that will be harmed." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment. But in Washington, a State 
Department spokesman expressed no sympathy with the Chinese protest. 
</P>
<P>
"Statements such as this make it more difficult to solve the issues we face," 
the spokesman said. "We hope the Chinese will work with us in a positive manner 
and take steps to improve the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentiments expressed in the U.S. Congress as well as by the Administration 
are a reaction to events in China. They are not part of a campaign against 
China. The President has made clear his desire for improved relations with 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Liu said that although the Bush Administration has expressed hope for 
restorating Sino-U.S. relations to a "positive track," it still bears "an 
unshirkable responsibility for the unbridled anti-China waves stirred up by the 
U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"To lift the sanctions by the United States against China is a necessary 
condition for the return to normal of bilateral relations," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
"China urges the U.S. government to truly honor its commitments and, proceeding 
from the overall interests of maintaining Sino-U.S. relations and the long-term 
interests of the two peoples . . . take effective measures to lift its 
sanctions against China as soon as possible."

IS BAKER BEING MUZZLED ON CHINA COMMENTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is Secretary of State James A. Baker III being overruled -- or censored -- in 
his comments on China by the White House? 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, at the last minute, Baker decided to cut references to the need 
for democracy in China out of his testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. The secretary's spokesman insisted Friday that Baker did so simply 
because of the need to save time. 
</P>
<P>
Baker came for his congressional appearance with a prepared, written statement 
that singled out both Cuba and China for criticism. But by the time he spoke, 
the criticism had been narrowed to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"Governments that try to shut out universally desired democratic values -- such 
as Castro's Cuba or in the tragic case of China -- serve only to delay their 
people's progress," Baker said in the written statement that was handed out to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But when the time came for Baker to speak, he left out the phrases "universally 
desired" and "in the tragic case of China." 
</P>
<P>
The question now is: Was Baker's last-minute change a hint that the secretary 
may have qualms about the Bush Administration's policy of reconciliation with 
the Chinese leadership -- a subject of persistent speculation? 
</P>
<P>
Baker has on several occasions emphasized that it is President Bush who sets 
the policy toward China and has avoided any close identification with that 
policy. On the other hand, whether out of conviction or out of loyalty, Baker 
also has defended the Administration's actions toward China in public and has 
worked hard to help Bush stave off a defeat on China issues in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At a State Department briefing Friday, Margaret Tutwiler, Baker's spokeswoman, 
dismissed speculation about his motives. "He took (the reference to China) out 
and made his statement shorter because he wanted to make it shorter," Tutwiler 
explained. She also pointed out that Baker cut several other lengthy passages 
out of his prepared speech. 
</P>
<P>
One reporter noted that the references to China in Baker's speech were so short 
that "if I say them real fast, I bet I can say them in a second." But Baker's 
spokeswoman stuck to her explanation. "I can't tell you that it was intentional 
or not intentional," she said. "Draw your own conclusions."

STREET SCENES: 'WE ARE PROBABLY SEEING HISTORY IN THE MAKING,' ARCHBISHOP TUTU 
SAYS OF DE KLERK'S PROPOSALS.

<P>
Black taxi drivers honked horns and stopped traffic Friday and workers whistled 
to celebrate President Frederik W. de Klerk's announcement of watershed 
political changes. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks surged into the streets in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg at the 
news that the African National Congress and other organizations had been 
legalized and many national emergency restrictions lifted. 
</P>
<P>
They streamed into the dusty roads of townships to cheer, and marched through a 
Cape Town train station chanting, "ANC! ANC!" while police watched passively. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably seeing history in the making in South Africa," said Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who could not stop smiling during a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We had expected that Mr. De Klerk might deliver something, but what he said 
has certainly taken my breath away," Tutu said. 
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg whites stepped out of their shops to take photographs and smiled 
as hundreds of blacks danced and marched through downtown, waving banners and 
newspaper headlines that declared: "ANC Unbanned." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers stopped their cars in the street, honking their horns and punching 
their fists into the air. Black workers leaned out of office windows, whistling 
and shouting. 
</P>
<P>
Police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles, chased some 
protesters and fired tear gas to disperse others. No injuries or arrests were 
reported, and many protesters laughed as they ran from the police. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, thousands of blacks banged placards against the fence around 
Parliament, chanting "ANC! ANC!" before De Klerk arrived to deliver his speech, 
which granted many of their demands. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the legalization of the ANC was picked up on a car radio. 
The predominantly black crowd of 5,000 broke into cheers, whistles and more 
chants as recently freed anti-apartheid activist Popo Molefe relayed the news 
over a bullhorn from the back of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be unreasonable if we failed to acknowledge that of all the 
presidents, of all the leaders of the Nationalist government, that in fact De 
Klerk has taken the most bold step and has emerged as the most courageous," 
Molefe said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. De Klerk, in his speech, has moved rather swiftly to meet most of the

undoubtedly, help to create a better atmosphere here."

A black youth climbed atop a statue near Parliament of Jan Christiaan Smuts, a 
former South African prime minister, waving an ANC flag and brandishing a 
wooden model of an AK-47 automatic rifle, the symbol of the ANC's military

<P>
But police riot squads remained out of view and there were no confrontations as 
the crowd marched joyfully through Cape Town's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently from the 
sidewalks, some shaking their heads.

Blacks and whites stood in groups with people reading the afternoon newspaper, 
whose headline said, "ANC Legalized."

Street dancing broke out in downtown Durban as a group of black railway union 
members marched through the city center to a crescendo of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
After dark, thousands of blacks paraded through the townships outside Cape 
Town, waving banners and singing hoarsely, while black men, women and children 
came to the doors of their tents or tin-roofed shanties to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, 
sounded a less-optimistic note as blacks marched in Cape Town. Saying that the 
black majority is not prepared to accept "a bone without meat," she said, "This 
is not what we expected today. We expected him to tell us: Go to Victor Verster 
(prison) and fetch comrade Nelson."

In Amherst, Mass., her daughter, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, 35, beamed at hearing

"The thing that really overjoyed me at 4 a.m. was the fact that my father's 
release is definite," she said at a news conference at the University of 
Massachusetts, where she is a Fulbright Scholar studying anthropology. "Even if 
it didn't happen today, the thought that I will have a father back, that he 
will be a free man again, is very, very good news to me."

PANEL OF SOVIET LEGISLATURE TO QUESTION BAKER

In another dramatic symbol of the armistice in the Cold War, Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III will appear before a Soviet parliamentary committee to 
answer questions next week when he visits Moscow, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented appearance by an American secretary of state in the witness 
chair of the International Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet parallels 
the visit last year of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the 
headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a time where a lot of things that haven't been done before 
are being done, and this is certainly one of them," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is scheduled to hold detailed discussions with Shevardnadze on Thursday 
and Friday in Moscow and is expected to meet Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev on Friday. Such talks have become commonplace features of superpower 
diplomacy, in times of tension as well as times of detente. But Baker agreed to 
remain in Moscow next Saturday to talk to the members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet legislature is acquiring increasing significance in Soviet 
political life," Tutwiler said. "It is also likely to play an increasingly 
important role in shaping Soviet foreign policy. Secretary Baker's meeting 
provides an excellent opportunity to deepen our own understanding of the 
thinking of Soviet legislators most concerned with foreign affairs as well as 
answer their questions about U.S. foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said there were no immediate plans for Shevardnadze to pay a return 
visit to the foreign policy committees of the Senate or House of 
Representatives. In recent months, however, lower-ranking Soviet officials have 
been witnesses on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is scheduled to leave Washington on Monday. On the way to Moscow, he 
plans to stop in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday for a visit intended to 
dramatize U.S. support for Czechoslovakia's democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's talks with Shevardnadze are intended to set the agenda for President 
Bush's summit meeting with Gorbachev, scheduled for June in Washington.

THREATENED STEEL STRIKE ADDS TO GORBACHEV'S TROUBLES; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: FEARING WAGE LOSSES, UKRAINIAN STEELWORKERS START SETTING UP 
STRIKE COMMITTEES. ANY STOPPAGE COULD SPREAD TO OTHER REGIONS AND INDUSTRIES.

<P>
Already under fire for the failure of his perestroika reform program to deliver 
economic dividends, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev now faces the threat 
of a potentially crippling steel strike as early as next week, the nation's 
media reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate threat is in the Ukraine, heart of the country's steel-making 
industry, but any strike could quickly spread to other regions and additional 
industries, according to the reports. The potential damage, both economically 
and politically, thus rivals that of last summer's coal strikes, which sent 
tremors through the power structure that still reverberate today. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are large cutbacks in wages and fringe benefits faced by the workers 
because of sharp increases in the cost to their employers of electricity, 
diesel fuel and transportation tariffs. The wholesale price increases were 
imposed earlier this year as part of the government's program to rationalize 
wholesale prices, and the mills are forbidden by decree from passing the boosts 
on to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, say the workers, unless the decree is repealed immediately the 
mills stand to lose millions of rubles. Under prevailing pay practices, that 
means either direct pay cuts or a sharp reduction in the so-called "social 
development funds" that pay for employee vacations, housing programs and other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
One mill, the Dnieprospetsstal conglomerate in Zaporozhie, calculates that the 
average salary of its workers will drop in March from the current 277 rubles a 
month to 212 rubles, or by about 20%, the government newspaper, Izvestia, 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"A wave of discontent has swept smelting plants in the Ukraine," added 
Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow. "The workers are calling for setting 
up strike committees." 
</P>
<P>
Interfax reported Friday that the Ukrainian Trade Union Council has requested 
the republic's government to either suspend the validity of the wholesale price 
decree or reduce the share of plant profits earmarked for the national budget 
in order to compensate for the losses. (The vast majority of Soviet enterprises 
are state-owned.) 
</P>
<P>
A shop-floor organizer quoted by Izvestia noted that "we have declared a 
moratorium on strikes for the next five years, and we are still managing to 
stave off a stoppage. But what about tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was meant to give the government a breathing space in which 
economic reforms would have more opportunity to show results. 
</P>
<P>
But now, said Izvestia, workers have set Monday as the deadline for the 
government to come up with some acceptable alternative. The newspaper added 
that representatives from chemical, lumber, agricultural machine-building and 
other industries also have voiced protests, although they are apparently not as 
hard hit as the energy-intensive steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's coal strikes so panicked government leaders that they quickly 
promised to meet virtually all the miners' demands. Later, they tried to renege 
on some of those promises, causing another outbreak of strikes in the far 
north. 
</P>
<P>
The mines are working now, but there are still tensions, and the strikes 
apparently have earned for the miners an extraordinary voice in national 
economic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of miners representing the country's major coal-producing regions 
met with Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Friday, Soviet 
television and the official Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Their frank conversation touched upon drastic problems facing perestroika 
policies, society and the Communist Party," according to the Tass account of 
the meeting. "Miners' representatives shared their ideas and came up with 
critical suggestions and proposals," it added.

400 IRAQI KURDS POISONED BY BREAD

<P>
About 400 Iraqi Kurdish refugees have been treated in Diyarbakir hospitals 
after eating poisoned bread, hospital officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians said a possible cause was the use of poor yeast to make bread for 
some of the 11,500 Iraqi Kurds given temporary shelter in the southeastern 
city. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
A similar poisoning outbreak was reported among Iraqi Kurds in southeastern 
Turkey last June. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it was caused by tainted food. But British scientists who analyzed 
blood samples of the victims said they believe that many Kurds had been 
deliberately poisoned with a toxic nerve agent, possibly by Iraqi agents.

JAPAN 'MONEY-POWER' POLITICS MAKES STRONG COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: RULING PARTY IS REASSERTING ITSELF SCANT MONTHS AFTER WITHDRAWING FROM 
THE SPOTLIGHT OVER THE RECRUIT SCANDAL.

<P>
Corruption is out of fashion as an issue in Japanese politics these days, and 
cries for political reform have given way to an adage: It's better for a 
politician to be a little dirty and get the job done than to be very clean but 
incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing the changing currents in public mood, the old guard of the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is reasserting itself only a few months after 
discreetly withdrawing from the spotlight amid allegations of unethical 
fund-raising and influence-peddling. 
</P>
<P>
It was less than a year ago that the Recruit bribery case, one of Japan's worst 
postwar scandals, toppled a prime minister, tainted the entire Liberal 
Democratic leadership and contributed to a humiliating defeat for the ruling 
party in the July election for Parliament's upper house. 
</P>
<P>
But as the campaign for the Feb. 18 lower house election gets under way, public 
outrage over "money-power politics," as it is called here, appears to have 
dissipated. The candidates themselves are doing little to bring it back into 
focus, fearing that the theme could easily backfire. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of this sudden bout of political amnesia does not look promising for 
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. If his party loses the election, he would 
certainly be forced to resign. But even if he leads the Liberal Democrats to a 
decisive victory, he is likely to be bumped from office by autumn in favor of a 
politician with traditional clout, one perceived as more competent, political 
insiders and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Shintaro Abe, the former foreign minister, Recruit scandal veteran and 
old-style party boss, is believed to be waiting in the wings to unseat Kaifu. 
This may actually be good news for Japan's drifting foreign policy and the 
government's paralysis in dealing with U.S.-Japanese economic friction. 
</P>
<P>
Although Abe, 65, has been ill and is rumored to be suffering from cancer, he 
is considered highly "competent." Kaifu, a relatively youthful 59, has a 
spotless record on graft, but he is a political lightweight who commands little 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely important to restore capability to the government so we can 
respond to the pressures of the U.S.-Japan relationship and the changes in the 
international scene," said Masayoshi Takemura, a lower house legislator and a 
member of Abe's faction in the ruling party. "We anticipate Mr. Abe will become 
premier by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Takemura, who serves on the Liberal Democrats' Political Reform Committee, 
conceded in a recent interview that Abe represents some of the more dubious 
traits in the system that his committee is ostensibly attempting to overhaul. 
Abe was the powerful faction leader who struck a back-room deal in 1987 with 
Noboru Takeshita, agreeing that the two would take turns serving as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's turn came first, but it was cut short by the Recruit scandal, in 
which Takeshita and Abe -- along with dozens of other ruling and opposition 
party politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen -- were revealed to have reaped 
huge profits from shady stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's contradictory," said Takemura. "We need to eliminate factionalism 
and make politics more open and democratic, but at the same time I feel loyal 
to Mr. Abe." 
</P>
<P>
Abe already appears to have begun his machinations to grab power. He stole 
Kaifu's thunder by making a dramatic trip to Moscow in mid-January to meet 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, just as Kaifu played to a small army of 
Japanese news cameras at the climax of his trip to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's virtuous agenda for political reform, meanwhile, has become the 
non-issue of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrows were raised momentarily when two criminal defendants in a bribery 
trial spun off by the Recruit scandal -- one a former Liberal Democratic 
Cabinet minister and the other a former top-ranking bureaucrat -- declared that 
they would run in next month's election. Both stand a fair chance of being 
elected in the atmosphere of tolerance that prevails. Support for the LDP has 
risen steadily, opinion polls suggest, since it bottomed out last July. A 
recent survey by the Asahi newspaper gives the ruling party a 37% rating, 
hardly solid but still closer to a tenable level. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese are a very forgetful people," said Minoru Morita, a political 
commentator. "I think 60% of the public has put the Recruit incident out of 
their minds." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, meanwhile, has kept largely quiet on the topic of political 
reform, preferring to stick to its singular hobby horse: an unpopular 
consumption tax the Liberal Democrats rammed through Parliament a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, making a fight out of corruption would be a high-risk tactic for the 
opposition, which has some recent scandals of its own to sweep under the rug -- 
involving even the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito, or Clean Government Party. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be fatal," said Seizaburo Sato, acting director of the International 
Institute for Global Peace. "People expect dirtiness in the LDP, but they're 
very upset when they find the opposition is involved in the same kind of dirty 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Sato, whose think tank is affiliated with another Recruit-muddied machine boss, 
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, summed up the popular sense of 
resignation about perennial LDP rule: "The Liberal Democratic Party is pretty 
bad, but without exception, the opposition is worse." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Recruit affair may fit neatly into a pattern repeated about 
once every 10 years since the Liberal Democrats took power in 1955. The ruling 
party has had a habit of getting into deep trouble over money scandals, then 
cleansing itself in a ritual of self-criticism and vague rhetoric on reform. 
Once voters absolve the party by voting to keep it in power, things go back to 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The old ways are justified because doing politics has gotten to be such an 
expensive proposition in Japan. The common wisdom of campaign finance is told 
in the phrase "goto, sanraku," which literally means "five-win, three-lose," 
implying that a candidate can expect to win a lower house seat spending 500 
million yen, or about $3.4 million, but is certain to fail with a war chest of 
only 300 million yen, or $2 million. (Japanese count big money in units of 100 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
Takemura's Political Reform Committee has proposed a number of steps aimed at 
containing the role of money in election campaigns, where the demands of 
spending can range from traditional gift-giving to illegal vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
One Liberal Democratic insider lamented, however, that the idea of political 
reform remains an abstract one to most voters, more often arousing simplistic 
images of white gloves on "clean" candidates rather than concrete revisions in 
institutions or procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the people demand reform, the party is not likely to carry it out, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us think the party is suffering from a kind of metal fatigue," said 
the insider, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "If we don't 
repair this soon, we're going to crash." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there seems little immediate prospect for substantial change. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the LDP will carry out fundamental political reforms no matter 
what happens in the election," said Takashi Inoguchi, a political science 
professor at the University of Tokyo.

MAN ACCUSED OVER NUDE PHOTOS AT DAY-CARE CENTER SLASHES SELF

A man who allegedly took nude photos of children at his day-care center was 
found with his right wrist slashed Friday as 14 of the children began 
undergoing medical and psychological exams. 
</P>
<P>
John Shaver, 56, was in fair condition at Broward General Medical Center after 
a maid discovered him at a hotel, Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Lauderdale police spokesman Maj. Joe Donisi said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaver was admitted as a psychiatric patient, police said. He faces five counts 
of possessing child pornography for magazines found at his home, just across 
the street from his Rainbow Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Ott Cefkin said the pictures Shaver allegedly took show the 
children wet or in a wading pool and often covered with finger paint. They do 
not depict sex acts and are not pornographic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen children who attended the day-care center were identified Thursday 
night by some of the 140 parents who went to the Police Department and sorted 
through 200 to 300 photos from Shaver's home. Three other children were 
tentatively identified and about 60 families still have to review the 
photographs, Cefkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The children shown in the photos reported to the Sexual Assault Treatment 
Center on Friday for medical tests and interviews, director Joanne Richter 
said. The medical tests are "mostly to alleviate the fears of the parents and 
(to) rule out the possibility of actual sexual abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaver, who was arrested Sunday, admits owning the pictures that police 
confiscated.

UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN REGENTS REFUSE TO BAN ROTC

University of Wisconsin regents refused Friday to expel the Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps, a move sought by a faculty group to protest the military's ban 
on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted, 13 to 3, to accept the recommendation of University President 
Kenneth Shaw, which calls for an aggressive lobbying effort to reverse the 
Pentagon policy. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's recommendation was adopted rather than a faculty-backed resolution that 
demanded that the ROTC be expelled in 1993 if the military continues to deny 
enlistment to homosexual men and women. Several other campus groups followed 
with similar resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw responded by saying he did not believe that severing the university's ties 
to the military would effectively encourage the military to change its policy. 
Furthermore, the elimination of the military programs would hurt those students 
who benefit from them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 students are enrolled in Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC programs 
throughout the university system's 13 major campuses; one-third are at 
UW-Madison, which has 42,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
The regents heard testimony from 15 people before voting in favor of Shaw's 
resolution, which called on the university to step up efforts it began in 1987 
to lobby Congress and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Marsh of the Wisconsin Student Assn. said that he was disappointed by 
the regents' vote but was encouraged by some of the members' comments. Some 
regents said they would want the ROTC banned if the lobbying to change military 
policy fails.

<P>
TECHNOLOGY: OFFICIALS SAY THE HIGH-POWERED COUNCIL IS THE FIRST SUCH GROUP TO 
REPORT DIRECTLY TO A PRESIDENT IN 15 YEARS.

<P>
President Bush announced the formation of a high-powered science advisory group 
Friday as he toured two university labs in a day of promoting science and 
technology that delighted much of the nation's scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep our competitive edge," Bush declared during a visit to a 
semiconductor lab at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
"All this brain work out here. It's a little awesome," the President said after 
negotiating through the lab's maze of microscopes, work benches and other 
high-tech paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush flew to Knoxville, Vice President Dan Quayle in Washington introduced 
the members of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- which includes California industrialist David Packard and Norman 
E. Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and so-called father of the Green Revolution -- 
will "advise the President directly in all matters of science and technology," 
Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's strong show of support for science and technology came 
only a day after more than 700 scientists, including 49 Nobel Prize winners, 
accused the President of being complacent about the threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
(Meanwhile, the Washington Post, quoting unidentified Administration sources, 
reports in today's editions that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu has 
ordered major revisions in a speech Bush will deliver Monday on global warming, 
toning down remarks originally designed to underscore the seriousness of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
(A draft of the speech now circulating within the Administration -- parts of 
which Sununu is said to have personally written -- shifts the focus to the 
scientific uncertainties of predicting that world temperatures will increase 
significantly because of heat-trapping gases, the Post reports.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration has been criticized by the scientific community on 
its cautious approach to the climate change issue, many were happy with the 
Administration's overall attitude toward science. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Hornig, who was science adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon 
B. Johnson, hailed Bush's trip and the formation of the panel of advisers. But 
whether those actions will translate to real gains for science and technology 
remains to be seen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very hopeful -- even enthusiastic," said Hornig, who now teaches at the 
Harvard University School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
He and many other leading scientists in recent years have vociferously 
criticized the neglect of science and technology during the Ronald Reagan 
years. But they grew optimistic last summer with the appointment of D. Allan 
Bromley, a prominent Yale physicist, as the White House science adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think we have some movement now," said Sue Kemnitzer, executive 
director of a congressionally chartered task force on minorities in science and 
technology. "I see a political consensus forming, and I commend the President." 
</P>
<P>
In introducing the panel, Quayle said the President "has delivered" on campaign 
promises of strong support for science and technology, noting that Bush's new 
budget unveiled this week contains $71 billion for research and development -- 
"a record high." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-man, 1-woman council is to meet at Camp David for three hours today with 
Bush, Quayle, Sununu and Budget Director Richard G. Darman, as well as Michael 
DeLand, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and Michael J. 
Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The science council, which will meet monthly, is chaired by Bromley, who is 
director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. He called 
the council "a major new step forward in the integration of science and 
technology into the highest levels of the Bush Administration." 
</P>
<P>
The council, according to Bromley, is "the first science group to report 
directly to the President in 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
In Knoxville, Bush met with officials of the University of Tennessee and the 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and then took part in two demonstrations 
involving the use of genetically engineered microorganisms to break down toxins 
in hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
During one experiment, in which Bush gamely added solutions to pollutants, the 
lab was darkened for three to four minutes to demonstrate the bioluminescence 
of the microorganisms as they attacked the pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos and Energy Secretary James 
D. Watkins, Bush also met with 20 junior- and senior-year high school students 
who are top scholars in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a speech at the University of Tennessee, which has produced top-notch 
men's and women's basketball teams, Bush easily mixed sports metaphors with the 
scientific topics of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"In science and technology, the United States is today the undisputed 
heavyweight champion of the world. We produce more scholarly works, more 
breakthroughs, more international prizes," the President said. "But like any 
champion, we cannot rest on our reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to defend our title day by day, week by week, year in and year out," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also called on Congress to act on Administration proposals to double the 
budget of the National Science Foundation by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, focusing on the "chaos in our classrooms," the President said that in 
the search for the solution, "Franklin had a word for it. Not Ben Franklin -- 
Aretha Franklin. She calls it: R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Kids need respect for teachers; 
respect for learning; respect for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology also 
include Bernadine Healy, Cleveland Clinic; Solomon J. Buchsbaum, AT&amp;T Bell 
Labs; Charles L. Drake, Dartmouth; Ralph E. Gomory, Sloan Foundation; Peter W. 
Likins, Lehigh University; Thomas E. Lovejoy, Smithsonian Institution; Walter 
E. Massey, University of Chicago; John P. McTague, Ford Motor Co.; Daniel 
Nathans, Johns Hopkins University; Harold T. Shapiro, Princeton University.

U.S. READIES TV MARTI AMID THREATS OF REPRISAL; 
</P>
<P>
INFORMATION: CASTRO VOWS TO DISRUPT BROADCASTS TO CUBA. INTERFERENCE COULD 
HAMPER AMERICAN TELEVISION AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS.

<P>
The Cold War may be waning in Europe, but it is thriving closer to home. Later 
this month, the United States will begin using a communications balloon over 
the Florida Keys to bombard Cuba with TV Marti, the Caribbean television 
equivalent of Radio Free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
TV Marti, the only official U.S. television broadcast aimed exclusively at a 
foreign country, was authorized by Congress for a three-month test at a cost of 
$7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro has promised to fire back. The U.S. communications 
industry fears this could mean serious interference with television and radio 
broadcasting in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro similarly threatened retaliation to Radio Marti when it began 
broadcasting in 1985, and he engineered nothing more than minor interference 
with Florida radio broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates since have hailed Radio Marti, named for Cuban nationalist hero Jose 
Marti, as a political triumph. Even opponents have conceded that it forced 
Castro to disclose news he might otherwise have suppressed, such as political 
defections, Cuban troop casualties in Africa and the arrival in Cuba of the 
deadly AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
TV Marti has the unqualified backing of the Bush Administration. "We believe 
that TV Marti will not only build on the success of Radio Marti but will 
enhance America's commitment to the free flow of information," Bruce Gelb, head 
of the U.S. Information Agency, said at his Senate confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Betancur, director of Radio Marti, is another enthusiast. "Can you 
imagine the Cuban people seeing the Berlin Wall coming down and the 
demonstrations in Czechoslovakia?" said Betancur, a one-time close adviser to 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Betancur's organization has been pumping out voluminous accounts of 
developments in Eastern Europe, but officials of the Voice of America, the arm 
of USIA that runs TV Marti, believe that photographs would carry greater 
impact. Reporting of the historic events by the Cuban media has been minimal, 
reflecting Castro's declared hostility to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's reform policies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Radio Marti has thus far largely escaped threatened Cuban vengeance, 
some Cuban experts say that the new project will be different. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Llovio-Menendez, the highest-ranking Cuban civil official to defect 
when he bolted from a plane in Montreal in 1981, predicted that Castro will 
retaliate the day TV Marti's signal reaches Cuban screens. 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel needed the immigration agreement (with the United States) in 1985, so he 
held off," said Llovio-Menendez, now a Council of Foreign Affairs scholar in 
New York. "If he lets this pass, he will really lose face." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R. I.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, pointed out that television signals are easier to jam than radio 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to have reservations about TV Marti," Pell said in a statement. "I 
await the results of the planned feasibility tests and a definitive 
interpretation of the project's compliance with international law." 
</P>
<P>
A foreign relations committee staff member, speaking on condition that he not 
be identified, said that the beaming of television signals outside the 
originating country's territory violates international conventions, which make 
an exception only for short-wave signals -- a standard that Radio Marti also 
violates. He said that Pell requested the State Department to provide legal 
justification for the project, but no report has been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Broadcasters has expressed legal concerns and technical 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"The government tried using a balloon for TV monitoring of the Mexican border 
and it was destroyed by a windstorm," NAB vice president Steve Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs' primary objection, he said, would be to any "spillage" of the 
signal that would directly interfere with commercial television broadcasters in 
Florida. He said that a Tampa station using Channel 13, the channel planned for 
TV Marti, would be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said that NAB members throughout the country could be affected if Cuba 
were to begin jamming, and the mechanism for compensation of damages is 
unclear. The fear of a radio war is real, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Coonrod, the deputy director of the Voice of America who is directly 
responsible for getting TV Marti started, dismissed the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience we have to go on is Radio Marti," Coonrod said. "All kinds of 
threats were made and not much happened. Radio Marti is now an established 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
Coonrod also rebutted objections of critics that the system will be subject to 
the vagaries of wind and weather. "There's an automatic cutoff of the signal if 
the transmitter gets more than a few degrees off its direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coonrod said that the one-ton transmitter was designed by General Electric 
specifically for the task. It is held aloft by a 175-foot-long balloon lent to 
the VOA by the Air Force, which also supplies the use of an air base on Cudjoe 
Key. A cable maintains the transmitter at 10,000 feet above the base, 120 miles 
northeast of Havana, the main target of the planned broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Coonrod said that the transmitter and its antenna have completed their 
preliminary tests and that "all components have tested to specifications so 
far." He said he hopes to begin broadcasting to Cuba in February. 
</P>
<P>
The VOA has been negotiating with Univision, a Spanish-language cable network, 
to supply news features and entertainment, but basic news will be prepared by 
TV Marti's own team in Washington. A special commission is responsible for 
programming, which will likely include such popular Radio Marti attractions as 
"Esmeralda," a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
No director for TV Marti has been named yet but a Cuban-American Florida 
businessman has been reported to be the leading candidate. He is Antonio 
Navarro of Key Biscayne, a former vice president of W. R. Grace and Co., who 
now serves on the advisory board of Radio Marti.

A federal jury in Philadelphia on Friday found General Electric Co. and two 
executives guilty of cheating the government out of more than $15 million on an 
Army contract. 
</P>
<P>
The government charged GE with padding a $244-million Army contract for a fleet 
of mobile computer systems designed to process data for battlefield operations. 
</P>
<P>
The two executives failed to notify the government of savings they negotiated 
with subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
GE was convicted of four counts of fraud and acquitted on one. The company was 
convicted on 282 counts related to making false claims and acquitted of 30 such 
counts. GE spokesman George Jamison said the company would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
GE faces a fine of about $50 million, plus court costs, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
David Howard told reporters after the verdict. If the company had been 
convicted on all charges, it would have faced up to $71.9 million in fines.

CUSTODY DENIAL FOR DRUG USE OKD; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT KEPT INTACT A PRECEDENT-SETTING APPEAL 
COURT RULING AGAINST A MOTHER WHOSE CHILD WAS BORN SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF 
ILLEGAL DRUGS SHE TOOK DURING PREGNANCY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court, acting in a precedent-setting case, has cleared 
the way for authorities to deny a mother custody of a child born suffering the 
effects of illegal drugs she took during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Over two dissenting votes, the justices refused to disturb a ruling last 
November by a state Court of Appeal in San Diego that for the first time denied 
custody solely because of a mother's drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action, taken in a brief order released Thursday, allows the 
appellate decision to become binding on trial courts throughout California. 
Only Justices Allen E. Broussard and Marcus M. Kaufman voted to grant a hearing 
of the mother's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The justices declined to hear claims by the attorney for a Vista woman in the 
case that drug use -- without other evidence of child abuse -- was insufficient 
grounds to deny custody. The ruling was so broad, the lawyer warned, that 
officials theoretically could remove custody because of harm to a child from 
the mother's smoking of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, James G. Dunn of San Diego, said Friday that the ruling 
represented an invasion of the constitutional right to privacy, and that an 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was probable. "We believe the state is 
improperly interfering with a mother's prenatal conduct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern also was expressed by Pamela A. Mohr, directing attorney for the 
Childrens Rights Project in Los Angeles, one of several legal and medical 
groups that had urged the high court to overturn the appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Mohr said the decision will have a "tremendous impact" in Los Angeles, perhaps 
doubling the 2,500 cases involving drug-affected babies that come into court 
annually. The risk of losing custody solely because of drug use, she added, 
would discourage pregnant women from obtaining prenatal and hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disturbed by this ruling," Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward J. Mantyla agreed that now it was likely 
that there will be increased attempts by authorities to deny custody to mothers 
whose children are affected by drug use. But he cautioned that such action by 
Juvenile Courts will be far from automatic. Also, he said, there are 
alternatives, such as permitting a father to retain custody. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's refusal to set aside the decision came as public concern has 
grown over narcotics use by mothers-to-be. The appeals court noted that 
according to a recent government study, an estimated 11% of the children born 
in U.S. hospitals have been exposed to dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation introduced at the state Capitol would provide added treatment 
programs for maternal drug abuse and in some instances allow manslaughter 
charges to be brought against mothers whose children die after birth from drug 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved a woman identified only as Kelly D., who gave premature birth 
to a son, Troy D., in February, 1988, at an Oceanside hospital. Both the mother 
and son tested positive for amphetamines and opiates, with the boy suffering 
from weight loss, lethargy and other signs of drug withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital reported the results to child protection authorities, and later a 
Juvenile Court took custody from the parents and placed the boy with his 
grandparents. The parents were permitted visits only with the consent of a 
social worker and were ordered to submit to psychological evaluations and to 
undergo drug rehabilitation, including drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
The mother challenged the action in court. But last Nov. 15, the state Court of 
Appeal upheld the removal of the child, saying officials had acted properly to 
protect the boy from abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"The severe problem of babies born under the influence of dangerous drugs due 
to their mothers' use of such drugs during pregnancy has reached great 
proportions," Appellate Justice Charles W. Froehlich, Jr., wrote for the panel. 
"We agree that prenatal use of dangerous drugs by a mother is (evidence) of 
future child neglect." 
</P>
<P>
The court acknowledged that the fetus does not enjoy the same legal status as a 
child after birth. But nonetheless, it said, a living child "must be afforded 
the protection of the Juvenile Court even though he is at risk because of his 
mother's actions before his birth."

BRADLEY TO REVIEW CITY DEPARTMENTS 
</P>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Friday that he will review the performance of 21 city 
departments, beginning with the Community Development Department, where 
problems have been noted over the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, beginning in March, one department will be the subject of a two-day 
hearing before a panel selected by his office, Bradley said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that problems regarding the Community Development Department that 
had been brought to his attention involved "shortfalls" in the expenditure of 
state and federal grant money by the department and community-based agencies. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had learned that the department had "failed to monitor 
subcontractors." 
</P>
<P>
The plan drew sharp criticism Friday from Councilwoman Joy Picus, who said she 
was "upset" that the City Council was excluded from the process. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the connections between the departments and the citizens," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
The panels will be made up of a deputy mayor, another member of the mayor's 
staff who serves as a liaison to the department involved, representatives of 
the city administrative office and the chief legislative analyst's office, an 
independent expert from the field under review, a volunteer management 
consultant and a "citizen-at-large." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley on Friday ordered the removal of Ralph Esparza as acting director of 
the housing division of Community Development and temporarily assigned his 
duties to Parker Anderson, the general manager of the department. Bradley also 
ordered a nationwide search for a new director of the housing division. 
</P>
<P>
Both Esparza and Anderson said Friday that they were unaware of any problems 
with Esparza's performance. He has been deputy director of the housing 
department for 10 years and will remain in that position, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also moved William Bruce, head of the CDD's job-training programs, to a 
new position and replaced him with Steve Porter, assistant general manager of 
the CDD. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce will head a new division responsible for internal audits, planning of 
innovative programs and solicitation of grants.

AQMD VOTES TO CURB HIGH-POLLUTING PAINTS, VARNISHES

<P>
Regional air quality officials on Friday slapped strict new controls on certain 
household paints and varnishes in an effort to improve air quality. The action 
was strongly criticized by paint manufacturers and contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The tough new rules, which will take effect in July and become even more 
stringent by the end of 1993, will affect between 15% and 25% of all paints and 
other architectural coatings sold in California. Total annual statewide sales 
of the affected products are estimated at $180 million by the Southern 
California Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The controls will reduce the amount of smog-causing volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) in a category of architectural coatings known as specialty coatings -- 
quick-drying and high performance oil-based enamel paints, primers, sealers, 
undercoatings, stains, wood preservatives, varnishes, lacquers and shellacs. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions are another example of how the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District's sweeping 20-year plan to bring the four-county basin into 
compliance with federal clean air standards is having an impact on everyone 
from big industry to homeowners. The AQMD already has required employers in the 
region to provide incentives for employee car-pooling. And it is planning other 
steps that will affect back-yard barbecuing, dry-cleaners and household 
products such as cleansers and aerosol sprays. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a question of our concept of life style in this basin," said Pat 
Nemeth, AQMD deputy executive officer. The new paints and coatings, she said, 
may well be inferior to those now on the market. But, she said, that is the 
price that must be paid for cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations approved Friday do not affect the water-based latex paints most 
popular with do-it-yourselfers, or oil-based paints, lacquers and varnishes 
with high VOC levels sold in more costly, quart-size cans or smaller 
quantities. The new rules, the AQMD said, are aimed at discouraging large-scale 
use of the products while not banning them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Paint manufacturers and contractors warned that the rules not only will drive 
up the cost of home remodeling, but will cause reformulated white and 
light-colored oil-based paints to turn yellow within 60 days of application. 
The contractors predicted that the changes will force them to add polluting 
solvents to improve the quality of the reformulated products. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD estimates that the rule will reduce VOC emissions by 4.5 tons a day, 
or about 1.2% of all the VOC reductions the district hopes to achieve within 
the next five years. Overall, VOC emissions from stationary sources is 578 tons 
a day, with architectural coatings accounting for 64 tons of that, or about 
11%. The bulk of the emissions come from business and industrial plants in the 
basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
According to the AQMD, the price for primers and sealers could drop as much as 
$3.60 a gallon, chiefly because costly solvents will be reduced. But staining 
products could increase by $1.10 a gallon because more expensive solvents must 
be substituted in those substances. 
</P>
<P>
Volatile organic compounds, sometimes called hydrocarbons or reactive organic 
gases, are one of two prime ingredients of photochemical smog. They combine 
with oxides of nitrogen -- produced by combustion -- and in the presence of 
sunlight are transformed into ozone, a health-threatening air pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were approved on a 7-2 vote after a five-hour public hearing on 
Thursday. Voting against the rule were Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and Gov. George Deukmejian's appointee to the board, Stephen 
Albright. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's public hearing, paint contractors, some manufacturers and 
others said that reformulating oil-based paints to reduce VOCs would require 
more coats of paint or varnish and still result in lesser quality. But those 
contentions were disputed by the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen said the rule could actually increase pollution because 
contractors would likely add smog-forming solvents to improve the product's 
performance and because more coats would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturers will get paid to make more paint, the contractor will get 
paid to put more on, and we'll all pay with our health due to increased 
emissions," Jim Sliff, technical services manger of Vista Paint Corp., told the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a crook. I feel like a cheat. I have to charge more money for more 
paint for less quality," said Anaheim painting contractor Don Salvatore. 
</P>
<P>
Others testified that painting contractors would add thinners and other 
smog-causing solvents to the reformulated paints and varnishes in attempts to 
improve them even though it would be illegal to do so. As VOCs are reduced, the 
paint becomes thicker and harder to handle, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really resent being put in the posture of being a criminal polluter," 
complained Mark Robson of Ram-Mar Painting Inc. in Hesperia. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said the new limits, in some cases, will have the practical 
effect of banning some home uses of lacquers altogether. The new lacquers will 
be too thick to brush on at home. So, in the case of kitchen cabinets, for 
instance, homeowners may have to buy pre-finished cabinets that are stained or 
varnished at a factory where more polluting lacquers can be used because the 
factories have air pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Once the regulations take effect, stores will have three years to sell stocks 
of inventories manufactured using the old formulas. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said enforcement efforts will focus on professional contractors. 
Penalties range from $1,000 to $25,000 a day for illegal use.

MURDERER READY TO DIE BUT SAYS IT'S SENSELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Condemned killer Robert Alton Harris said he is prepared to be executed but 
should not be put to death because it would be senseless to kill someone who 
has changed in prison into a "very caring human being." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, convicted of the 1978 murders of two teen-age San Diego boys, also 
said his "spirits are up" as he watches his appeals run out. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he tries not to think about San Quentin's gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't harp on it, I don't really think about it," he said. "I live a day at 
a time." In an interview this week with San Diego radio station KFMB, Harris 
said the two killings are not "something I have relished over." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, whose case has progressed farther through the court system than any of 
the 272 other prisoners on California's Death Row, was convicted of the murders 
of Michael Baker, son of a San Diego police officer, and Michael's friend, John 
Mayeski. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a broad challenge to 
Harris' death sentence, moving him a step closer to becoming the first person 
executed in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court judge is expected at a hearing Monday to set Harris' 
execution date, sometime in March or April.

PANEL SAYS STATE ACTED TOO SLOWLY IN COASTAL INSURANCE CO. INSOLVENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee issued a report Friday on last 
year's insolvency of the Coastal Insurance Co., concluding that there had been 
numerous violations of state law, fraudulent sales practices by both the 
company and its sales agents, and a failure on the part of the state Insurance 
Department to act promptly to close Coastal down. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) expressed concern that 
insolvencies in the insurance industry have been mounting, putting a drain on 
both the California Insurance Guarantee Fund and the state's citizen 
ratepayers, who are levied a surcharge on all policies to pay off claims 
through the Guarantee Fund against bankrupt companies. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to the Guarantee Fund in the last four years were $693 million, 
according to the report, compared to a total of $150 million in the 13-year 
period after organization of the Guarantee Fund in 1969. Johnston called the 
trend alarming, and speculated that unless corrective steps are taken, the 
insurance industry could follow the savings and loan industry into dire 
financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal became well known to television viewers in the late 1980s for the 
advertising slogan, "It's no problem," selling about 200,000 policies by 
appealing to drivers with poor records. It was placed into conservatorship by 
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie last February, and, on her petition, 
later ordered liquidated by a court. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's report, however, the Assembly committee, which held five 
investigative hearings into the collapse, said there was evidence the Insurance 
Department knew Coastal was in financial difficulty a year before the company 
was shut down and did not take timely action to cut losses, which it estimated 
will run the Guarantee Fund $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
The report accused the department of failure to file charges against the 
company for "flagrant violations" of state laws requiring that it give notice 
to insurance authorities of its true financial condition and also of various 
money transfers to parent companies. The department was also accused of failing 
to follow through on promised disciplinary actions against the company's chief 
sales agents, FGS. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Gillespie and the Insurance Department said Friday that the 
department had moved on all these matters as quickly as it could. 
</P>
<P>
"(The) assessment that the department failed to move swiftly enough ignores 
principles of due process to which all persons are entitled under the federal 
and state constitutions," said the statement issued by spokeswoman Carey 
Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
She also disclosed that the department is working with Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp's office "in preparing a case against principal persons connected with 
Coastal." 
</P>
<P>
The former chief executive officer of Coastal, Harry O. Miller, declined 
comment on the report, as did Sid Field, owner of the still-active FGS. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said FGS continues to write 10,000 assigned-risk policies each month 
and thus is a major factor in the growth of the money-losing assigned-risk 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston and two other Assembly members, Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and Bob 
Epple (D-Norwalk), said at a Los Angeles news conference that they will sponsor 
several bills designed to strengthen the power of regulators to deal with bad 
sales practices and difficult financial situations in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
One bill would allow the insurance commissioner to prevent someone, such as 
Field, who has lost his agent's license, from continuing to participate in the 
insurance business. Under present law, Field can continue if he simply finds 
someone else with a valid agent's license to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
A second bill would authorize the commissioner to shut down insurance 
organizations if they continued to employ people whose licenses had been 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Other bills would require auditing of annual company financial statements filed 
with the Insurance Department. Also, the chief executive officers of all 
companies would be required to notify, in writing, both the insurance 
commissioner and the company's board of directors whenever a company became 
financially impaired or insolvent.

CHINA MUST SELL U.S. AIRCRAFT PARTS MAKER, BUSH SAYS;

TRADE: THE ORDER IS THE FIRST TIME THE TAKEOVER OF AN AMERICAN FIRM BY A 
FOREIGN BUYER HAS BEEN BLOCKED SINCE NEW LAWS TOOK EFFECT. THE PRESIDENT CITED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, using new emergency powers, moved Friday to nullify the recent 
sale of a Seattle-based civilian aircraft parts-manufacturing firm to an arm of 
the Chinese government for fear that it might jeopardize U.S. national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
While on a visit to Knoxville, Tenn., to highlight high-technology issues, Bush 
ordered the China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corp. -- known 
as CATIC -- to divest itself of Mamco Manufacturing Co., which it had acquired 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said CATIC would have until May 1 to sell Mamco to an 
acceptable buyer, or face a court order and possible penalties later. In the 
meantime, the Administration's high-level Committee on Foreign Investment in 
the United States, which had urged Friday's action, will monitor the divestment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The action, which followed a unanimous recommendation by the eight-member 
interagency panel, marked the first time that the U.S. government has blocked 
the takeover of an American firm by a foreign buyer under provisions of the 
1988 Omnibus Trade Act. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written statement that Bush's 
decision was based on "credible confidential information" that continued 
control of the American firm by China "might threaten to impair the national 
security." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush's action was tied directly to the circumstances of the case and 
did not signal any change in America's traditional openness to foreign 
investment or in U.S. policies affecting other investments by China. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes foreign direct investment in this country," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for reporters, Administration officials repeatedly declined to 
spell out precisely what it was about the sale that so concerned the foreign 
investment committee, contending that to do so would involve disclosing 
classified information. 
</P>
<P>
Mamco manufactures brackets and other components used in the manufacture of 
civilian aircraft. Its major customers are Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas 
Co., which already export airliners to China. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials said the government had been "very concerned about the 
past activities" of CATIC, which is the military procurement arm of the Chinese 
aerospace ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The implication was that U.S. intelligence agencies had compiled evidence that 
CATIC had previously sought to buy into U.S. firms to gain access to military 
technology. Officials apparently were afraid that it might use Mamco's 
technology for military purposes as well. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said there is no indication that Mamco had done anything to 
endanger the national security. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decision was expected to have relatively little impact on 
U.S.-China relations. Had Bush overridden his advisers' recommendations and 
approved the sale, it would have heightened tensions with Congress, which wants 
him to take a harder line. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also took pains to point out that the Administration had explored 
ways to save at least part of the sale, perhaps by having CATIC divest itself 
of particular parts of the Mamco operation, as has been done in similar cases 
before. "We've looked at every possible avenue," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision provided a dramatic demonstration that the Administration is 
prepared to block foreign takeovers when it believes that genuine national 
security issues are at stake -- an issue that had remained unresolved until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Mamco officials nor spokesmen for the Chinese government were available 
for comment Friday. A Mamco spokesman said Kenneth A. Keller, the company's 
president, was not taking calls. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision received mixed reviews from lawyers involved in representing 
U.S. and foreign clients in such takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first in which the foreign investment committee has recommended 
that a sale be rolled back. During the 15 months since enactment of the new 
law, the panel has reviewed 243 foreign takeovers. It has investigated six of 
these and sent four to Bush for a decision.

YOUTHFUL BIOTECH INDUSTRY STRUGGLES TOWARD MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the 15 years since the term biotechnology burst into the public 
consciousness, the "industry" has been little more than hype and hope. The 
first of the hoped-for products have finally made it to market, but 
biotechnology is still a very young industry -- at most a toddler finding its 
way on still wobbly legs. 
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology is "nowhere close to a mature industry," said Howard E. (Ted) 
Greene, former chairman of Hybritech Inc. and now a principal in Biovest 
Partners, a San Diego venture capital firm. "We're still riding a growing wave 
of biotechnical research that won't play out for another 10 to 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement that Roche Holding Inc. agreed to invest $2.1 billion in 
Genentech and acquire 60% of its stock highlights both the opportunities and 
the hurdles the industry faces en route to maturity. Further consolidation is 
certain, analysts said, for the same reasons that many traditional 
pharmaceutical companies have recently merged: The tremendous expense of 
bringing drugs to market. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the agreement for Roche to invest in Genentech boosted several 
biotech stocks Friday. Amgen Inc. rose $4 per share to close at $48.75. Chiron 
Corp., another California-based firm among the industry leaders, closed at 
$26.375, up $2.625. 
</P>
<P>
"The Genentechs of the world need the Roche's of the world for capital," said 
G. Steven Burrill, chairman of Ernst &amp; Young's San Francisco-based 
biotechnology consulting group. Consolidation on a smaller scale had already 
begun. And, Burrill said, he expects the large European and Japanese 
pharmaceutical companies to buy into more U.S. biotechnology firms. 
</P>
<P>
The European giants are "flush with cash," said Steven B. Gerber, an analyst 
with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "It's becoming increasingly 
difficult for the independent biotech firms to raise funds and those companies 
(consume) a lot of capital," he said. The financial markets for raising capital 
are not terribly accessible today, and the new issues market is particularly 
"not too healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem for the industry is clearing regulatory hurdles, Burrill 
said. "Unlike other fields, the technology doesn't go directly to customers," 
he said. "Companies may never see customers if they don't get their products 
through the regulatory process -- the FDAs (Food and Drug Administration) of 
the world. The regulators are the gatekeepers of the industry. This is not 
meant to be negative (and) not to say there shouldn't be regulation. But the 
process is taking a long time and this is increasing the cost of bringing drugs 
to the market dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that it takes from $150 million to $250 million to bring a 
single drug to market. For the same amount that large pharmaceutical firms 
invest over a couple of years in research and development, they can buy a 
company with a promising product, Gerber said. 
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalist Greene noted that traditionally small technology firms, 
particularly in medicine, have been purchased by bigger companies. "Genentech 
has remained independent a lot longer than average," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms still lead the world in biotechnology, but the Japanese in 
particular have aggressively entered into marketing, research and equity 
agreements with about 250 U.S. biotechnology companies. Late last year, Chugai 
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. bought San Diego-based Gen-Probe outright for about 
$115 million. 
</P>
<P>
A relatively few biotechnology products have made it to market, but Burrill 
said the industry is about where it was expected to be in the 1990s. The most 
promising products were not expected to make it to market before the 1990s, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The industry should grow much larger in the 1990s than the current $2 billion 
in revenues as biotechnology plays a bigger role in formulating new drugs. 
Biotechnology drugs are not replacing traditionally formulated drugs, Burrill 
said. "Most of the new biotech drugs are creating new markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech is considered the largest in the industry, but analysts said there 
has been some blurring of definitions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
companies. In the past five years, Greene said, biotechnology companies have 
emerged doing research focusing on chemical engineering technology rather than 
gene splicing technology or the cell fusing techniques that have led to new 
antibiotics. These recent companies look more like traditional pharmaceutical 
companies that rely on chemical research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the biotechnology firms analysts and other observers consider to be 
industry leaders is Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, which won FDA approval of 
erythrpoietin, or EPO, a gene-spliced version of a naturally occuring protein 
in the kidney that triggers production of red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
The drug was approved to treat kidney disease patients suffering from chronic 
anemia. But Amgen's prospects are clouded by a patent dispute with Genetics 
Institute of Cambridge, Mass., another leading biotech firm. Amgen and Genetics 
Institute hold different patents on EPO. 
</P>

Florida's Largest S&amp;L Seized: Federal regulators seized Florida's largest 
thrift, CenTrust Bank, blaming its failure on junk bond investing and on lavish 
spending on art, a company yacht and high salaries. The Treasury's Office of 
Thrift Supervision declared that the Miami-based S&amp;L was operating in an 
unsafe and unsound condition and turned it over to the Resolution Trust Corp. 
for sale or liquidation. Centrust, with $8.2 billion in assets, is the nation's

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: MAKING SENSE OF ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our adjustable-rate mortgage keeps increasing although it is based on 
the 11th District cost of funds, which has been stable for the last two months. 
My problem is compounded by the fact that the figure I see in the newspaper is 
not the figure the bank says is operable. My bank says the index is about 0.2 
percentage points higher. How do I find out who is right? -- Y. B. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are not the only homeowner confused by the workings of the 11th 
District cost of funds, an otherwise esoteric measure of savings institutions' 
cost of attracting deposits that came into the limelight in the early 1980s 
with the rising popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
First, a brief explanation of the index and how it operates. The index is the 
weighted average cost of all funds deposited into the more than 200 savings 
institutions in the 11th District of the Federal Home Loan Bank, a territory 
that covers California, Arizona and Nevada. Among the funds tracked are those 
in savings, checking and money market accounts, certificates of deposit and 
other bank instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The interest rates of all these accounts are averaged to determine the index, a 
figure that represents the interest rate the savings institutions actually had 
to pay their customers to attract the money they now have available to lend. 
</P>
<P>
The district computes the index rate monthly and publishes the figure for one 
month on the final working day of the following month. This is probably where 
your problem with your bank stems. Although we cannot be absolutely sure, the 
two-month lag often leaves room for confusion. For example, the index for 
December, 1989, which was announced last Wednesday, is 8.476%. This rate will 
be used for mortgages originating this month and for existing mortgages set to 
recalibrate with the rate in effect in February. But this is not the February 
rate. That number won't be known until the end of March, and it won't take 
effect until April. 
</P>
<P>
To unravel your confusion, you should talk to your lender and make sure you 
understand which month of the year governs your mortgage adjustment. Perhaps 
your lender has made a mistake, or perhaps you don't understand the terms of 
your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is for sure: Your lender cannot arbitrarily and unilaterally 
alter the terms and conditions of your mortgage loan agreement. The month, the 
applicable index and the allowable margin over that index should be clearly set 
forth in your contract. So, if your mortgage rate is tied to the 11th District 
cost of funds in December, your basic rate would be 8.476, plus any margin 
above that base allowed by your contract. (Many agreements allow a lender to 
charge 2 percentage points, or more, above the 11th District index.) The 
current 11th District rate is available on a taped telephone message to 
California callers at (415) 393-1418.

Few Benefits From Selling Half of Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering selling half of our current home, worth about $300,000, 
to our son and purchasing a new home for ourselves. The purchase price of the 
new home would probably exceed $300,000. I am over age 55 and my wife and I 
have lived in the house for 25 years. Because we are selling only a portion of 
the house, are we still eligible to take advantage of the $125,000 exclusion of 
our profits from the sale? Or if we can't take the exemption, can we defer 
taxation on the capital gains from the sale by buying a new house? -- R. H. R. 
</P>
<P>
A: Our tax experts consider your plan innovative, but -- unfortunately -- 
illegal. Basically, you're not selling your principal residence; you're only 
selling half of it. And that leaves you unqualified to invoke either of the two 
tax-sheltering advantages otherwise available to you: the $125,000 exclusion 
available to home sellers age 55 or more and the deferral of gain by purchasing 
a replacement principal residence. 
</P>
<P>
So if you elect this option, you would be liable for taxes on whatever profit 
you realize from the sale, an amount that you would calculate by deducting half 
your cost basis in the house from your sales proceeds. Remember, your cost 
basis is determined by adding the costs of any capital improvements you made to 
the house to its original cost.

REGULATORS SELL TEXAS S&amp;L IN BAILOUT'S BIGGEST DEAL

Federal regulators on Friday sold the insolvent Bright Banc Savings Assn. of 
Dallas to an Ohio bank holding company in the largest thrift sale since 
enactment of the S&amp;L bailout law in August. 
</P>
<P>
Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, is receiving $1.1 billion in government 
assistance to acquire Bright Banc, founded in the early 1980s by H. R. (Bum) 
Bright, once one of the 50 wealthiest men in the country and the former owner 
of the Dallas Cowboys football team. Banc One is paying $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Banc, with $3.1 billion in assets, is the biggest failed thrift in Texas 
and the largest yet sold by the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is one of the first in which the RTC has persuaded the buyer to take a 
substantial portion of the thrift's loans and other assets. Banc One is getting 
$1.7 billion of the S&amp;L's assets, including residential mortgages, consumer 
loans, cash and securities. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is keeping $1.4 billion in assets, mostly sour loans and repossessed 
real estate. After it sells the assets, it estimates the government's total 
loss on the institution will be $1.4 billion, including the $1.1 billion paid 
to the Ohio company. 
</P>
<P>
RTC officials had promised a major sale after undergoing a tongue-lashing 
earlier this week from members of the Senate Banking Committee upset with the 
slow pace of the Administration's S&amp;L cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has taken over more than 350 failed thrifts, disposing of 43 of 
them. But, in most of the transactions it has simply transferred the failed 
institutions' deposits to the new owner and retained the assets for later sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bank One Texas, a unit of the Ohio holding company, is assuming all $2.6 
billion of Bright Banc's deposits in 250,000 accounts. The thrift's 48 offices 
will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition gives Bank One Texas a formidable retail network in Texas. It 
would add Bright Banc's branches to the 63 it currently operates and create a 
combined institution with about $14 billion in assets, among the 25 largest 
banking operations in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Banc One first ventured into Texas in June with the purchase of 20 failed banks 
formerly owned by Dallas-based MCorp., getting an estimated $2 billion in 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio company has a reputation as a pioneer in retail banking. It was one of 
the first banks to offer automated teller machines. And it has been a leader in 
packaging obligations owed by credit card holders into securities for sale to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Banc was created in the consolidation of three smaller S&amp;Ls and 
invested aggressively in Texas commercial real estate. It got into trouble when 
property values began to decline following the 1986 collapse of oil prices.

DOW RISES 16.44 AS INVESTORS CHEER JOB NEWS 
</P>

<P>
The stock market posted a moderate gain Friday after a government report on 
January employment boosted investor confidence about the economy and eased 
recession fears. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 16.44 points to close at 2,602.70. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,004 issues up, 495 down and 473 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 164.40 million shares, up from 154.58 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady 
at 5.3% last month while 275,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created. The 
number of new jobs was substantially higher than market expectations of about 
160,000 jobs, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stock investors took the attitude that employment is better than expected, 
which means business is better than expected and the economy is not in a 
recession," said Jack Solomon, equities analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said renewed merger activity also helped to revive takeover stocks. In 
particular, drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost from news that Roche 
Holdings would acquire a majority stake in Genentech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rally, the market retraced some of its gains late in the day as 
investors remained cautious ahead of next week's $30-billion Treasury 
refunding, which could provide a better clue about the prospects for interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed broadly higher in thin trading, 
boosted by program buying. The Nikkei 225-share index, which gained a modest 
17.47 points Thursday, soared 443.73 points to 37,650.15. 
</P>
<P>
British shares edged higher, helped by early strength on Wall Street. By the 
close the Financial Times 100-share index was 9.3 points up at 2,355.1.

Economy's Strength Weakens Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tumbled after the government released the January employment report 
suggesting that the economy is stronger than expected, diminishing chances for 
lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 
in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, jumped to 8.50% 
from 8.43% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Thursday.

Dollar, Gold Rise in Quiet Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mostly higher in light, uneventful trading on world 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose, with gains more pronounced in overseas dealings. On New 
York's Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold gained 20 cents to close at 
$418.20. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $418.50 an ounce, up 85 
cents from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose following the better-than-expected employment report.

Most of the day's activity centered on the dollar and the West German mark, 
both of which moved in a wide range.

On other commodity markets, copper and precious metals rose; livestock and meat 
were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.

Gasoline futures posted the sharpest gains, settling 0.83 cent to 1.9 cents 
higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 64.22 cents a gallon; West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 0.32 to 0.44 cent higher, with March at 
23.02 cents gallon; heating oil was 0.77 cent to 1.52 cents higher, with March

USG Corp: The Chicago building materials company reported 1989 net income of 
$28 million on sales of $2.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For 1988, net income totaled $125 million on sales of $2.25. billion. The 
figures are not comparable due to restructuring changes incurrd in mid-1988 
recapitalization. The company noted that gypsum board sales at its largest 
subsidiary, United States Gypsum Co., continued strong despite a reduced 
housing market.

AT THIS 4-H SHOW, COMPUTERS WILL HOG ALL THE ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Be careful: The blue-ribbon winner in this 4-H contest bytes. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Monday is the Second Artificial Life 4-H Show, featured attraction of 
the Artificial Life II Workshop in Santa Fe, N.M. While artificial intelligence 
uses computers to model the mind, artificial life practitioners use computers 
as a medium for evolution, ecosystems and self-reproducing automata. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 biologists, physicists, anthropologists and computer scientists 
are expected to attend and discuss the latest approaches to transforming 
software and silicon into life-emulating creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Artificial life is the new metaphor for machinery," says Esther Dyson, a noted 
computer science critic. "In the last century, people built things; this 
century, people are going to grow them." 
</P>
<P>
To add the spice of competition to the conference, the organizers sponsored 
their own 4-H contest in 1987 to let the participants show off their artificial 
life forms. "It was a way to have fun and reward people who did interesting 
things," says Chris Langton, a staff scientist at Los Alamos National 
Laboratories' complex systems group and a 4-H judge. "Our criteria were for 
things that were the most lifelike -- we won't say alive yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Best of Show" at the first Artificial Life conference in 1987 went to a team 
that developed a program that grew "branching structures." These structures 
evolved in forms uncannily similar to real life plants. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to a computer scientist who developed software "boids" -- 
bird-like computer creatures that emulated flocking and schooling behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
The possible front-runner in this year's contest -- expected to have more than 
50 entries -- is "Rod Brooks' Lab at MIT," says Langton, "if they bring along 
some of their critters." The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 
"Microbots" are a hot topic in the growing artificial life community. 
</P>
<P>
The real 4-H Council -- the one that sponsors thousands of county fair contests 
each year -- doesn't quite know what to make of this. "Are you serious?" asks 
4-H spokeswoman Denise Miller. "I'm having difficulty visualizing this."
