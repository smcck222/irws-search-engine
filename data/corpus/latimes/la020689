A disabled former Marine who said his life was ruined after he thwarted the 
possible assassination of President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 has been found dead 
in his apartment here. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver W. Sipple, 47, died of natural causes, the coroner's office said. His 
body was discovered Thursday by an acquaintance checking on him after he had 
not been seen for several days. An autopsy was performed, but the coroner's 
office declined Sunday to reveal the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple, who was wounded in Vietnam, was in the crowd outside San Francisco's 
St. Francis Hotel on Sept. 22, 1975, as Ford emerged. Sipple saw Sara Jane 
Moore's outstretched hand holding a chrome revolver aimed at the President. 
</P>
<P>
A shot was fired but missed Ford, apparently because of Sipple's deflection. A 
cab driver suffered a minor wound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ford Letter 
</P>
<P>
Sipple, who was retired from the Marines on full disability pension, received a 
letter from Ford expressing "heartfelt appreciation" for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week later, as the media thronged about him, it was reported that 
Sipple was a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, John E. Wahl, filed a $15-million invasion-of-privacy suit 
against seven major newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times. The suit 
alleged that Sipple's relatives stopped speaking to him and that he was exposed 
to contempt, ridicule and humiliation. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ira 
Brown dismissed the suit and his ruling was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Figure 
</P>
<P>
"They decided against him, wrongly I think," Wahl said Friday. "They said that 
because he thrust himself in the limelight by saving the President's life he 
became a public figure." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl said he last saw Sipple more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was sentenced to life in prison for the assassination attempt.

TRAGEDY RETOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a weary sadness to the story emerging from the present Senate hearings 
into allegations of corruption in the federal programs dealing with American 
Indians. The hearing transcripts will take their place on federal bookshelves 
next to other volumes that tell the same shameful tale over and over again -- a 
tale of distrust, deceit and neglect. There is an occasional chapter of 
well-meaning paternalism, but an overwhelming theme of exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all may be a pervasive perception that nothing can be done to make the 
situation right. This is not to suggest that the Select Committee on Indian 
Affairs is doomed in its attempt to identify the failings of the present system 
under the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, or to 
propose some new program that will work. The committee must make every effort 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the testimony that most people will remember will deal with the 
alleged corruption perpetrated by both federal bureaucrats and tribal leaders. 
As the hearings continue, there is likely to be particular emphasis on the 
excesses of Peter MacDonald Sr., the controversial leader of the Navajo Nation, 
and items like the $650,000 spent to remodel his own offices and business deals 
with relatives and buddies. 
</P>
<P>
The MacDonald story contributes to the myth that while Indians want to preserve 
tribal sovereignty and seek self-determination, they just cannot be trusted to 
handle their own affairs. Playing to this theme are those who promote the 
notion of free enterprise or assimilation for the Indians but insist on an end 
to tribal federal assistance in exchange, leaving the impression that the only 
alternatives are poverty and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
There are success stories throughout the nation of thriving Indian 
economic-development programs. But the hulks of failure abound as well, like 
the abandoned Sun Lodge Motel and the closed carpet mill across the road from 
the Custer Battlefield on the Crow reservation in southern Montana. These were 
the sort of tribal enterprises that were to create jobs for the unemployed and 
help keep young Crows from moving away. 
</P>
<P>
Tribal leaders insist that the businesses failed because they were ill 
conceived and "they weren't our ideas to begin with." Truman Jefferson, the 
tribal secretary, said in an interview with the High Country News that the mill 
was doomed from the start. Such failures then become stock examples of Indian 
ineptitude at the white man's business. "Now when we try to do something they 
refer back to the Sun Lodge and the carpet mill," Jefferson said. Down on the 
Navajo reservation, some of the entrepreneurial projects are beginning to turn 
sour, too. Thus the perception is reinforced that self-help programs are bound 
to fail no matter how much the well-intentioned non-Indian capitalists try to 
help. It is an age-old story that has affected attitudes toward Indians ever 
since colonial days -- the notion of an unbridgeable cultural gap. 
</P>
<P>
But the record also suggests that whites still are too quick to exploit the 
Indians' lack of expertise and to take advantage of both inter-tribal and 
intra-tribal political rivalries in promoting deals. There is considerable 
evidence from the Senate hearings so far that federal bureaucrats have indulged 
in this practice or tolerated it while running Indian programs with 
considerable inefficiency and mismanagement. The federal government must move 
away from a paternalistic relationship with the tribes toward real 
partnerships, but it also must accept responsibility for its role in tribal 
economic failures. 
</P>
<P>
There have been proposals already to abolish the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or 
to reorganize it outside the Interior Department. The mere substitution of one 
federal agency with another usually does not solve the problem. In this case, 
however, the bureau may have become so stigmatized that reorganization is the 
obvious place to begin. Even so, that would be just the first step in building 
a real program of tribal self-sufficiency, pride and dignity.

CHANGING THE GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paraguay's Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, whose 35 years of iron rule gave him the 
modern longevity record for Latin American dictators, has been overthrown by a 
junta with democratic pretensions. But there is scant evidence that the coup 
amounts to anything more than replacing one dictator with another. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner had ruled his landlocked nation of 4 million with absolute power 
since 1954, when he ended a long period of civil strife in Paraguay with a 
coup. He found the title of dictator distasteful, and created an elaborate 
facade of democracy in Paraguay that included a political party, the Colorados; 
the party routinely nominated him for president every four years, and he 
routinely won with 90% or more of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner maintained his grip by jailing or exiling legitimate political 
opponents and corrupting everyone else. The largest source of foreign exchange 
in Paraguay has long been contraband, electronic items and other goods smuggled 
from abroad and sold openly in a black market. Smuggled goods financed the 
payoffs that kept most of Paraguay's ruling class, especially the general's 
fellow officers, content with the regime. 
</P>
<P>
Only in recent years has Paraguay felt the stirrings of genuine democracy, 
inspired by new democratic governments in neighboring Brazil and Argentina and 
by an awareness that Stroessner, now 76, was increasingly frail. The regime 
still kept anti-Stroessner demonstrations and a small but courageous opposition 
press in close check. 
</P>
<P>
What appears to have happened is that elements of the system that Stroessner 
built have turned against him. The key question is whether they did so because 
they want to change the way things are done in Paraguay, or simply to preserve 
the status quo. Until the answer is clear, the United States and the rest of 
the world must look on claims that the new Paraguayan junta is democratic with 
a healthy dose of skepticism.

CONTROVERSY OVER PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Congress that now wants thousands of dollars in pay raises has presided 
over the dismantling of the family farm, the misallocation of taxpayer 
resources to a corrupt Pentagon, and has protected industry that pollutes our 
earth in the name of free enterprise. It has allowed the American taxpayer to 
be raped by our own government officials who have arranged for the buyout of 
savings and loans knowingly run by the greedy and corrupt, has encouraged by 
its tax legislation the merger-acquisition-buyout mania that makes a few men 
wealthy but puts the average man out of work, and is allowing the sale of 
America to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
These men and women in Congress have the power, authority and responsibility to 
deal with these and our many other serious problems, yet they refuse to do so 
until the situation reaches "meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, our members of Congress seem to be concerned with only two things: 
retaining their seats and increasing their salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
We, who scramble for pennies at a personal level, pay the bills. Congress 
spends our pennies into the billions, often paying for corruption and 
ineptitude at the highest level without oversight and accountability. This 
misallocation of our tax resources contributes to the lack of resources for 
domestic programs to alleviate the suffering of many of our fellow citizens now 
out of work, living in shelters, many of whom are children. 
</P>
<P>
It is incredible that under these circumstances our Congress has the temerity 
to come begging for thousands of dollars in pay raises, saying they are long 
overdue. This "let them eat cake" attitude on the part of Congress is immoral. 
</P>
<P>
It is my feeling that when Congress has the fortitude to handle some of this 
nation's problems on a bipartisan level with the best interest of the country 
in mind, there will be overwhelming public support for a pay raise. At this 
point, I think we deserve a refund.

BLACKS, LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Frank del Olmo on his articulate essay about the combined 
efforts of both blacks and Latinos in their court battle with Los County and 
its Board of Supervisors ("Partners, Not Rivals, in County Suit," Op-Ed Page, 
Jan. 27). Growing up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, I always thought that had 
Latinos and blacks merged together in their fight for civil rights many more 
successes and accomplishments would have followed for both groups. I also 
suspect that the transition and accessibility for future minority immigrants 
would have been made somewhat easier. 
</P>
<P>
As Del Olmo so deftly opined, by working together to change the system all of 
us benefit by the use of all of our talents. It would have worked 20 years ago. 
Let us not waste another opportunity.

IN HEARING DEFICIT ALARMS, WE TURN A DEAF EAR TO SOME POSITIVE POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES WOLF JR., Charles Wolf Jr. directs RAND Corp. research on 
international economic policy and is dean of the Rand Graduate School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While it's true that the deficit twins -- the budget deficit and the trade 
deficit -- are important, the degree of concern currently expressed about them 
is exaggerated. Failure to reduce, let alone eliminate, the deficits may be 
imprudent. It would not be a disaster. The budget deficit is actually a less 
serious problem than is commonly assumed, and the trade deficit is already in 
the process of downward, if admittedly uneven, adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Three extenuating considerations are usually overlooked in the exaggerated 
rhetoric about the budget deficit. First, from the standpoint of the effects of 
budget deficits on credit markets and the international accounts, what matters 
is the consolidated budgets of the states as well as the federal government, 
not the federal budget alone. Because the states have amassed a substantial 
aggregate budget surplus in recent years, the consolidated deficit shrinks by 
$50 billion to $60 billion annually. Thus, the consolidated budget deficit for 
1988 is about $100 billion, or about 2% of the U.S. gross national product -- a 
figure not out of line with comparable figures in Japan, West Germany or 
Britain in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the federal budget deficit exercises a braking effect on the otherwise 
strong political pressures in a pluralistic democracy for government spending 
to rise. In general, there is a small negative, but statistically significant, 
relationship between the size of the federal deficit in one year and the 
increase in federal spending in the succeeding year, net of inflation and net 
of debt service: A higher deficit in one year generally means a smaller 
increase than would otherwise occur in federal spending in the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a substantial component of capital formation in federal 
government spending. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University has estimated 
this component at between $100 billion and $250 billion annually -- the higher 
figure includes military procurement and military R&amp;D. It is not 
inappropriate to finance genuine and productive public infrastructure by 
government borrowing, because the infrastructure contributes to improved 
functioning of the economy and to widening the tax base, provided the capital 
expenditures have been wisely selected in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there remain good reasons for wanting to see the budget deficit 
reduced: for example, to keep interest rates down, to damp inflationary 
expectations, to restore fiscal policy as a credible instrument for countering 
recessions and, finally, to convey -- internationally as well as domestically 
-- the image of a responsible government that lives within its means. But these 
reasons are not matters of urgency, but rather of degree and of timing. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the other twin, there are encouraging signs that the trade deficit 
is already diminishing under the impact of two powerful market forces: the 
lowered exchange value of the dollar, and the discipline imposed on U.S. 
producers by having to compete for market share with foreign imports in the 
United States, and with foreign products in world export markets. As a result, 
the trade deficit in 1988 was about $20 billion below the approximate 
$152-billion deficit of 1987. By 1989, that figure will probably decrease by 
another $10 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. trade deficit declines, the adjustment problem this will create for 
the rest of the world will probably be considerably greater than that for the 
U.S. economy. It is too easy for our friends in Western Europe and East Asia to 
forget that, for the U.S. trade deficit to diminish, the trade surpluses of 
other countries -- especially Japan, West Germany and the Asian newly 
industrialized countries -- will have to decline; or they and other countries 
will have to experience trade deficits, or some combination of the two will 
have to occur. One finds much more criticism these days from European and Asian 
governments concerning the need for America to "do something about its trade 
deficit," than recognition of what this implies for their own economies. And 
these implications remain whether the U.S. trade deficit is reduced by actions 
that affect the U.S. budget deficit, the U.S. savings rate or U.S. investment. 
</P>
<P>
This prospect could be adversely affected by one development that has generally 
been overlooked. The attractiveness of U.S. assets, including real property, to 
foreign investors may propel a continued strong desire by foreigners to invest 
in the United States, in the process raise the dollar's value and impede the 
downward adjustment of the U.S. trade deficit. It is worth bearing in mind that 
capital flows can generate a trade deficit, rather than being generated by it. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, neither deficit warrants alarm. The federal budget and the trade 
accounts are less significant indicators of the economy's health than are the 
maintenance of sustained real economic growth, high employment and low 
inflation.

'BURNING BEACH': AN ALLEGORY ABOUT CUBA'S POLITICAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright Eduardo Machado's family came to the United States after the Castro 
revolution, when he was only 8 years old. Naturally, Cuba is a magical island 
to Machado and his characters. The aunt in his "Broken Eggs" (1984) even 
imagines that her "second self" is still living down there. 
</P>
<P>
Machado's new play at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, "A Burning Beach," is set 
in the twice-mythical Cuba of the past. The time is 1895. Two well-brought-up 
sisters have just lost their sinful Papa, and who is to take charge of the 
plantation now? 
</P>
<P>
Also figuring in the story are their black maid, with whom their father sinned; 
their half brother, the result of the sin; a beautiful and seductive American 
girl who claims to be related to Teddy Roosevelt; and the young leader of the 
first Cuban independence movement, Jose Marti. 
</P>
<P>
Actor E. J. Castillo makes Marti a dream presence, more than an actual one, 
perhaps reminding us of the godlike, young singing star in the play that 
Machado has just translated, beautifully, for the Mark Taper Forum, Jose 
Ignacio Cabrujas' "The Day You'll Love Me." There, too, we had a tribe of 
sisters wondering what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
"A Burning Beach," however, has a much more political agenda than the Cabrujas 
play. It is an allegory. The young American woman (Jennifer Joan Taylor) stands 
for seductive American imperialism. The black maid (Jonelle Allen) stands for 
voodoo and heat. The half-brother is Cuba (Robert Beltran), realizing that its 
mixed-blood is its strength. 
</P>
<P>
The two sisters? The frilly one (Christine Avila) is the patrician class, 
beautiful but ineffectual. The angular one (Ellen Barber) is harder to read. 
She shows considerable spirit, up to a point, but ultimately accepts being 
defined as an onlooker rather than a maker of history. Maybe we need to know 
more of the actual history here, or maybe Machado hasn't made his statement 
clearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
How does it work as a play? Not particularly well. Certain scenes go nicely: 
the business where the Yankee girl tries to seduce the sisters by turn, the 
meeting between the son and the mythical Marti. 
</P>
<P>
But the overall effect reminds one of the play's front curtain, presumably 
painted by designer John Iacovelli. It's a mural of heroic figures with a white 
space in the middle, as though the mural (the revolution?) hadn't been 
completed. We admire the scale of the work, we enjoy the freshness of the 
colors and we can make a general guess as to the strategy of the composition. 
But it doesn't truly fall into place, as a good mural and a good play ought to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
To marry the allegorical and the personal is a tough trick. "A Burning Beach" 
doesn't quite give us characters in whom we can believe, yet doesn't quite give 
us a clear and compelling social parable either. We may need to have more about 
the son's journey, the only one that has a real arrival. But something's 
keeping the story at bay. 
</P>
<P>
The production, co-directed by Bill Bushnell and Jose Luis Valenzuela, 
emphasizes visuals so strongly that one suspects a certain lack of confidence 
in the text. There are some striking stage pictures here -- a room full of 
cane-bottom chairs knocked askew by the fighting sisters, a row of doors 
opening onto a ghostly green void, a "beach" that is planks. (Douglas D. 
Smith's hot lights and Jon Gottlieb's surging ocean sounds supply the rest of 
the picture.) 
</P>
<P>
But when everything has to stop at a crucial point until the next scenic effect 
is ready behind the curtain -- this involving lots of candles -- the trappings 
of the production get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play that needs momentum, not pageantry. 
</P>
<P>
The acting, throughout, is lively and idiomatic, with Barber particularly 
affecting as the angular sister who doesn't know exactly what she wants, but 
knows that it's more than this. The cast understands the play in its blood, and 
that's a big help to the spectator who doesn't. Even then, "A Burning Beach" 
stays just out of reach.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that we are a world living with the threat of AIDS is, at last, a fact 
of our national theatrical consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
On Broadway today, two of the hottest plays in town, both from the Seattle 
Repertory Theatre, deal with AIDS as a contemporary given: "Eastern Standard" 
and "The Heidi Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Standard" even flirts briefly with a joke on what has now become the 
cliche of the stock gay character discovering he has AIDS. When a gay man 
complains that the worst thing he had ever imagined has happened to him, his 
straight friend gasps and then the gay man nods tragically: Yes, he has indeed 
lost his maid. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Hoffman's "As Is," playing at the Lyceum Space through Feb. 25 is, 
in many ways, a throwback to an earlier era when the condition was so new that 
an entire play could be built around a character's discovery that he has tested 
positive on the one exam everyone wants to fail. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "As Is" is so elegantly and movingly done by San Diego StageWorks in its 
premiere production that it is impossible not to feel the shock, anger and 
despair of a story unfolding that by now, sadly, we all know too well. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of "As Is" is the loving relationship between Rich (Jeff Okey) and 
Saul (Barry Mann), which breaks off when Rich runs off with Chet (Rick Kunz) 
and resumes -- at Saul's insistence -- when Saul discovers that Rich has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the play echoes "The Shadow Box," the touching story of 
terminal illness that tells of loss through a variety of vignettes and 
overlapping voices offering variations on the central stories. 
</P>
<P>
The excellent ensemble cast, under the direction of Alan Craig DiBona, moves 
smoothly over a striking range of roles: leather-clad pickups at a gay bar, 
crisis-control phone operators, straight relatives, doctors, AIDS patients in a 
therapy group, individuals giving testimony to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptional among these are Patricia DiMeo as a hospice worker making 
bittersweet jokes to get through the dying, Christopher Redo as Rich's straight 
brother wrestling with his love for a sibling and his fear of infection, and 
Larry Baza as everything from a lonely heart in a gay bar to an AIDS patient 
with a refreshing facility for cutting through the crap. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, Okey as Rich never softens his characterization to beg our 
sympathy for his niceness. Rich is smart but difficult, charismatic but deeply 
angry that this blow has been dealt him; he lets the zingers fly and does not 
flinch when he sometimes draws the occasional blood even from those he loves. 
</P>
<P>
Through the course of the story, we learn to love him on his terms, so that we 
can understand the sacrifices Saul is willing to make for him. 
</P>
<P>
The production values reflect the care that underlines the entire production: 
the careful costuming by John-Bryan Davis, the subtle lighting by Joseph D. 
Naftel and the striking set by Marc Sanchez that tells a poignant story by 
itself: airy and modern, Sanchez's design concludes with an exit framed by two 
ruined columns like a veritable gate to the other world. The broken pillars 
serve as a reminder not only of the ruined body Rich will be leaving behind, 
but of a more beautiful time when we all did not live under the threat of this 
disease like a modern sword of Damocles. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;

<P>
FUNKY VIEW OF SAN DIEGO PROVIDED BY CHANNEL 39

<P>
Last year, KNSD-TV (Channel 39) underwent major changes to establish a new 
identity for the station, and now it has one. It has firmly established itself 
as The Station with the Funky Station Breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the verdict is still out on the rest of the station, but it's time 
to acknowledge that the new station breaks may be the most interesting thing to 
happen on local TV since future Professional Television Journalist Bree Walker 
did a heart-stopping commercial, showing nothing but her lips, for a local 
radio station. Each station break is its own pleasant vignette. A pretty 
picture of San Diego is shown -- a picturesque shot of the bay, people at work, 
a sunset. The picture is always a live shot, provided by cameras situated 
around the county. With the station logo prominently displayed, they are 
complete with the station's theme music, which makes viewers feel as if they're 
in an elevator watching the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking from television tradition, Channel 39's station identifications 
actually give viewers real information. Each one displays the time and the 
current temperature. Every day people throughout San Diego say things like, 
"Gee, it sure is cold." Then they turn on their television sets and Channel 39 
tells them that, yes, indeed, it's 42 degrees outside, or whatever temperature 
it happens to be. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing these little moments to San Diegans every half-hour is a major 
endeavor for the station. Two cameras are mounted on tall buildings in San 
Diego and guided by remote control. One is atop the San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric Building; the station won't divulge the location of the other camera 
for fear it will be vandalized. The station periodically moves the other 
camera, just to provide a little variety in the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The station has established strict rules for using the cameras, primarily that 
they not be aimed at people. Channel 39 doesn't want to be known as The Peeping 
Tom Station. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the remote cameras, Channel 39 has an employee, dubbed the 
"Community Camera," whose sole responsibility is to wander around San Diego 
seeking pretty pictures from 3 p.m. to midnight each day. 
</P>
<P>
The station breaks only last for a few seconds, but they still have some 
entertainment value. When it rains, the remote cameras tend to provide surreal 
pictures, sort of like looking at San Diego in a dream sequence. Occasionally, 
a blissful shot of the bay from the camera atop the SDG&amp;E building will 
suddenly be interrupted by a huge 727 landing at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 executives believe this is the first time a station has attempted 
live station breaks. The idea was the product of Ivan Ladizinsky, a consultant 
and longtime cohort of station general manager Neil Derrough. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our grand themes is to become the San Diego television station people 
couldn't mistake," Channel 39 director of broadcast services Doug Dougherty 
said. "We consider (the station breaks) to be a distinctive and integral part 
of our identity." 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, The Station with the Funky Station Breaks will take this concept a 
step further, showing all aspects of San Diego life. Maybe the "Community 
Camera" can set up in Southeast San Diego and provide live glimpses of gang 
activity. A camera could be mounted inside Mayor Maureen O'Connor's kitchen, so 
people could watch the mayor eat breakfast. Or perhaps a camera could be placed 
in the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Then people would really remember The Station with the Funky Station Breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a poll of subscribers conducted by Southwestern Cable TV are a 
little less than fascinating and bordering on the strange. It is a poll only of 
Southwestern subscribers willing to put a stamp on a questionnaire and return 
it to the station. In other words, we'll give the benefit of the doubt to the 
majority of Southwestern Cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 125,000 questionnaires sent out, 11,000 were returned, a healthy number. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to list their favorite channels, the 11,000 chose the Arts and 
Entertainment Network, followed by the Discovery Channel -- impressive choices. 
It's a little strange that "Headline News" finished fourth, ahead of ESPN, but, 
remember, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. Asked what services they 
would like added, the response was "Bravo," a fine choice, followed by -- and 
this is really strange -- the Weather Channel. The Weather Channel? 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the poll, Southwestern is leaping into action. Bravo will be added, 
Arts and Entertainment will be expanded to 24 hours and -- drum roll please -- 
the Weather Channel will return. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere there is a hall of fame for cheesy TV. Paul Bloom's "Crime Watch" 
reports on Channel 39 are long overdue for membership. Not only does Bloom 
often come across like a shill for the police department, there is nothing 
cheesier than Bloom's dramatic re-creations of crimes. Last week, impeccably 
dressed in a double-breasted suit, he charged up the stairs in front of a 
house, fiercely pantomiming a criminal with a machine gun, looking like a very 
well-dressed 10-year-old playing G.I. Joe. . . . "Break of Dawn," the film 
biography of San Diegan Pedro Gonzalez produced by the San Diego-based 
Cinewest, will finally get its Los Angeles debut March 8. . . . Yes, it is 
sweeps month, which explains the current avalanche of tacky, well-advertised 
television news "special reports." . . . Executive producer Mel Buxbaum said 
Channel 10 has committed to 13 weeks of the Roger Hedgecock Show. Channel 10, 
though, was not so definite. Details are still being worked out, program 
director Don Lundy said. But the station has slotted the show on Sundays at 6 
p.m. for the next few weeks. Sunday's show is scheduled to be on animal rights. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Turner of KSON-FM (97.3) thought he had been nailed for speeding last 
week when he was stopped while driving the station's van on the way to a 
charity radiothon sponsored by the station. Instead, the La Mesa police officer 
gave him a $5 donation for the radiothon, which raised $150,000 for St. Jude 
Children's Hospital. Disc jockey Mike Brady offered to mow the lawn for anybody 
who donated $150. One caller offered $75 if Brady promised not to come over. A 
few minutes later, a caller bid $120 -- if Brady didn't come over to his house, 
either. . . . Union-Tribune editors were scheduled to meet Sunday for another 
"test" workshop, designed to give editors a chance to practice putting out the 
paper in case of a strike. Last year's workshop resulted in the infamous mock 
edition, featuring a bogus headline proclaiming a new Jesse Jackson and Pat 
Robertson coalition, which was accidentally delivered to about 100 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Steele, the new CEO of the California Theater, is a little frustrated in 
her attempts to build a movie audience at the theater, which is primarily used 
as a concert hall. An unadvertised Humphrey Bogart double-bill two weeks ago 
attracted no more than half a dozen people. The following week, after running 
ads in three local newspapers, a screening of "From Here to Eternity" filled 
about 10 seats. Steele hopes to develop the theater as "an all-around 
entertainment venue," including movies.

The Chinese may soon be getting a look at Madonna. Promoters are trying to 
arrange a tour for the Material Girl this spring, which would make her the 
first American pop star to sing in the People's Republic, China Youth News 
reported. The newspaper said negotiations are under way between mainland China 
promoters and agents in Hong Kong for the singer to arrange the tour. Last 
year, Shanghai promoters were reported to be negotiating with agents for 
Michael Jackson to arrange a tour for him but nothing came of it. ALEENE

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going to federal Court in 
Los Angeles today to protect the image of its famous Oscar. At issue is a 
statue manufactured by Creative House Promotions of Chicago and awarded by the 
Houston International Film Festival. "No other trophy manufacturer has imitated 
us quite as enthusiastically," said Academy executive administrator Bruce 
Davis. Oscar, a sculpted man holding a sword, is 13 1/2 inches tall (including 
a 3-inch base), weighs 8 pounds and is 24-karat gold-plated. The Houston 
trophy, a man holding a large star, is 12 inches tall (including a 4-inch 
base), weighs about 5 pounds and has a gold-colored metallic coating. Creative 
House Promotions also sells the trophy to other groups. Houston festival 
director J. Hunter Todd said he doesn't believe that "any of the movie 
directors or stars who have been awarded the trophy have in any way confused it 
with an Oscar." Houston has used the trophies for 11 years, but the Academy has 
not complained until now, Todd noted. Davis says the Academy became aware of 
the similarity about a year ago and wrote letters trying to dissuade the 
festival from using the trophy. "If you know about an infringement and fail to 
object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain," said Davis.

Playwright Arthur Miller has added his voice to the growing number of writers 
and artists around the world calling on Czechoslovakian authorities to free 
jailed playwright Vaclav Havel. "I can't imagine a government in Europe in 1989 
doing this to a writer. It is beyond belief, it is a horror," said Miller. 
Havel, a founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement, was arrested Jan. 16 
for calling for protests to mark the 20th anniversary of the suicide of student 
Jan Palach, who took his life to protest the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of 
Czechoslovakia. Havel's plays are acclaimed abroad but banned at home. Miller's 
play, "The Archbishop Ceiling," highly critical of Czechoslovakia's Communist 
rulers, is currently playing in Budapest. Noted Miller: "It's amazing. We live 
in curious times." ALEENE MacMINN and JUDITH MICHAELSON

Andre Previn travels to Vienna and Hong Kong this month. The Los Angeles 
Philharmonic's music director conducts his orchestra's Pension Fund benefit 
Tuesday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (when Itzhak Perlman is soloist 
in Beethoven's Violin Concerto), then takes the red-eye to Austria. In Vienna, 
Wednesday through Saturday, Previn will rehearse the Vienna Philharmonic in 
preparation for the orchestra's engagement at the Hong Kong Festival, Feb. 
15-22. In Hong Kong -- the Vienna Philharmonic is the only orchestra playing at 
the 1989 festival -- Previn will lead the orchestra in four programs, including 
Beethoven's Fourth and Seventh Symphonies, Dvorak's Eighth (which he leads 
here, Tuesday) and other works by Mozart, Brahms, J. and R. Strauss and Haydn's 
Symphony No. 104. Previn returns to Los Angeles Feb. 25, and will conduct his 
next L.A. Philharmonic concert on March 3. ALEENE MacMINN and JUDITH MICHAELSON

More than 100 firms from West Germany, Europe and the United States helped 
build the chemical plant in Libya that Washington says is intended to produce 
poison gas, the head of a West German company said. He did not identify any of 
the firms. Ernst Pieper, chief of the state-owned Salzgitter AG concern, said 
in an interview with the newsmagazine Der Spiegel that because so many firms 
were involved in constructing the plant at Rabta, near Tripoli, it is possible 
no single company could have known its ultimate use. " . . . In the end, none 
of the firms had a true overview for the whole project," Pieper was quoted as 
saying.

The crew of the shuttle Discovery flew to Florida's Kennedy Space Center for a 
practice countdown amid work to remove the first of three suspect engine turbo- 
pumps that must be replaced before a delayed blastoff in March. Discovery's 
crew -- commander Michael Coats, 43; co-pilot John Blaha, 46; James Bagian, 36; 
Robert Springer, 46, and James Buchli, 43 -- flew to the spaceport to 
participate in a dress-rehearsal countdown scheduled to end Tuesday with a 
simulated engine ignition. Engineers working in Discovery's engine compartment 
were disconnecting a high-pressure liquid oxygen turbopump from the shuttle's 
three main engines.

Iranian President Ali Khamenei said that diplomatic relations with Washington 
will not be possible until the United States abandons its hostile posture 
toward Iran, Tehran Radio said. "There can be no change in our stance against 
America, unless there is a change in American foreign policy toward Iran," the 
official broadcast quoted Khamenei as saying. "What forces us into our present 
stance against the United States is its hostile and extremely conspiratorial 
behavior toward the Islamic Republic and the revolution. . . ." Khamenei said 
improved relations would have to be preceded by the release of billions of 
dollars in Iranian assets frozen by the United States after the Islamic 
revolution in 1979.

State courts convicted about 583,000 felons in 1986, a new analysis by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics said. The analysis, for the first time providing 
data on state court felony activity, found that about 46% of those convicted 
that year were sent to a state prison and another 21% to a local jail. A 
spokesman for the bureau, part of the Justice Department's Office of Justice 
Programs, said the last nationwide prison count showed there were 604,824 state 
and federal prisoners as of June 30, 1988, an increase of 23,240 over the 
number six months earlier. If that trend continued, the nation would need 900 
new prison beds every week, said the spokesman. The analysis, based on data 
from 100 counties throughout the country, found that state courts accounted for 
about 95% of all felony convictions.

Pakistan successfully has test-fired its first long-range, surface-to-surface 
missiles, its army chief, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, said. Quoted by the official 
Associated Press of Pakistan, Beg told military officers that two versions of 
the missiles, with a range of 185 miles and 50 miles respectively, were tested 
recently. "These missiles, including their guidance systems, have been 
developed indigenously," he said, adding that Pakistan would also be able to 
roll out its first homemade tanks within two years. Beg called the missile 
production a "landmark achievement" by Pakistan. The development, however, 
could signal renewed tension between India and Pakistan, which have fought 
three wars since independence from Britain in 1947.

Carbon monoxide fumes from propane heaters built up in an ice-fishing shanty on 
a frozen lake near Manitowoc, Wis., and killed four teen-agers -- three boys 
and a girl -- sheriff's officers said. The 7-foot-by-6 1/2-foot wooden shanty 
was one of more than 50 such shelters on Harpt Lake. The victims were staying 
overnight as they participated in an ice-fishing derby. A friend of the victims 
who was going to join them fishing found the bodies at dawn. "The girl's father 
was in the shack right next door. He tried mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation, said 
Mary Lee Stueck, a contest organizer.

Eighteen Brazilian prisoners died and eight others were injured after they were 
jammed into a tiny cell in a punitive action following an attempted jail break, 
authorities said. Several died of asphyxiation, while others were trampled to 
death by cellmates when about 50 prisoners were packed into a 3-by-9-foot cell 
without a window or ventilation, a Sao Paulo state prison system spokesman 
said. The prisoners were confined to the cell after grabbing a guard at the 
Parque Sao Lucas jail in Sao Paulo.

Roman Catholic Mass was celebrated in Vilnius Cathedral for the first time 
since the Communist authorities of Soviet Lithuania seized the building 40 
years ago and turned it into a warehouse. The 17th-Century cathedral in the 
Lithuanian capital was packed as Bishop Julijonas Steponavicius prostrated 
himself in front of the pillared altar in a reconsecration ceremony. The 
cathedral was seized in 1949 as part of a campaign by Communist authorities 
against organized religions in the three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia 
and Estonia, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. The 
authorities agreed last October to return the cathedral amid signs of a warming 
in relations between church and state.

<P>
The last Soviet soldier left this besieged capital city Sunday, Soviet media 
reported, and President Najibullah vowed that his fragile government will not 
succumb to the rebel onslaught expected after the Soviets complete their 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
In a report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, Moscow Radio 
quoted today's edition of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda as reporting 
that "on Sunday, the last Soviet soldier left Kabul." It said Soviet soldiers 
remain in other parts of the country, including at the airport just outside 
Kabul, but that they are moving toward the border. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran, representatives of the Afghan resistance meeting in Tehran signed a 
cooperation pact Sunday, clearing the way for a united front against the Kabul 
regime, Iran's foreign minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet news agency Tass said Kabul is "effectively under martial 
law," adding that some new security measures had been taken in the capital. It 
said tensions had begun to rise as Soviet troops pulled out, just 10 days ahead 
of the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul on Sunday, Najibullah told members of the ruling People's Democratic 
Party that his Marxist government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the 
Soviet pullout after a decade-long occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war," Najibullah told 
about 10,000 party members who gathered in bitter cold near the presidential 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd chanted "Down with imperialism" and brandished thousands of unloaded 
Kalashnikov assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Weapons have been distributed among party organizations in Kabul "so that every 
one of us could defend the cause," said Daud Razmyar, first secretary of the 
Kabul city committee of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russian armies are leaving the country, and we will defend ourselves," 
said the 43-year-old Najibullah, dressed in combat fatigues. "We have to be 
strong. We have to unite." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, more than a dozen Soviet transport planes streaked off in 
different directions, spewing flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles 
used by the guerrillas. Artillery fire could be heard in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials in Kabul said today that the last troop convoy left the 
capital Saturday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that 
a battalion of about 1,000 Soviet soldiers will remain at the airport, on the 
outskirts of the city, to assist the supply airlift into the capital. They are 
not expected to pull out until Feb. 12 or Feb. 14, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the Afghan moujahedeen 
delegates "finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future 
government for Afghanistan." He refused to give details of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan resistance movement is split into two groups: the minority Shiite 
alliance, based in Iran, and the larger Sunni coalition in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The pact came after weeks of negotiations and clears the way for a united front 
against the Kabul regime, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said it is believed the two sides agreed on the number of seats 
each will take in a proposed national representative council, which they hope 
will lead to an interim government to replace Najibullah's regime. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December, 1979. Under a 
U.N.-mediated accord, Moscow agreed last year to withdraw all of its estimated 
115,000 troops by Feb. 15.

BUSH TO ASK S&amp;L BAILOUT BY BANKS; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER DEPOSIT PREMIUMS WOULD RAISE MONEY FOR INSURANCE FUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will call on banks to bear most of the financial burden of 
paying for the costly rescue of the federal insurance fund for savings and loan 
deposits, government and industry sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy S&amp;Ls would be expected to shoulder a smaller share of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan hammered out at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., over 
the weekend by Bush and his top financial advisers, the government would spend 
about $50 billion over three years to shut about 350 failing S&amp;Ls and pay 
off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which Bush is expected to propose this week, would require 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Reforms Sought 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said that Bush's plan would also call for 
substantial reforms within the thrift industry designed to prevent a recurrence 
of the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that the plan would place oversight of S&amp;Ls 
under the Treasury Department but would likely merge the administrative duties 
of the two agencies that insure funds at S&amp;Ls and banks. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion would come from the sale of 30-year bonds by a federal 
financing agency, and taxpayers would pay interest on the bonds -- probably 
about $5 billion a year once all the bonds were sold. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an equal sum of money would be raised through additional 
premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls for their federal deposit insurance, to 
offset the bond interest payments on the federal budget. Thus, the Bush 
Administration will be able to assert that the taxpayers would not be bailing 
out insolvent savings institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the additional funds would come from the banks, which now pay 83 cents 
a year for each $1,000 in deposits for their deposit insurance. The proposed 
increase would bring banks' premiums to $1.80 or $1.90, figures sure to provoke 
cries of outrage from the banking community, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;Ls, which pay $2.08 per $1,000 in deposits, are likely to face a 
smaller increase, but officials did not indicate a specific level. "We're going 
to bring banks up, but not as high as S&amp;Ls," one knowledgeable official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank Outrage Described 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be a war," predicted a banking industry official, who said banks 
are outraged at the idea of paying for a problem they did not create. 
</P>
<P>
Some bankers had indicated privately that they would accept a lesser increase 
in their insurance premium than the Administration seems prepared to propose. A 
50% increase, from 83 cents to $1.20, "might be acceptable," an official of a 
major West Coast bank said. "But the further you get, the greater the level of 
opposition. A big increase will generate massive opposition from the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating these arguments, the Administration will tell the bankers that 
they would simply be paying higher premiums into their own insurance fund and 
not directly helping to alleviate the S&amp;L crisis. But the availability of 
the banks' money would enable the Treasury Department to use other funds for 
the S&amp;L problem without worsening the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bush Administration was putting the final touches on an S&amp;L 
rescue plan that would place most of the financial burden on banks, the 
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said Sunday that taxpayer funds must 
be the "last resort." 
</P>
<P>
The government, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) said on ABC's "This Week 
With David Brinkley," should "look within the industry for all of the financial 
help you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Riegle gave tentative support to the argument that industry competition will 
keep savings institutions from passing on any increased deposit insurance fees 
to consumers. This concept was advanced by another guest on the program, 
Preston Martin, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and an 
investor in California S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said "there is no way" the increase could be passed along to customers 
of the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition for savings in this country, particularly from Wall Street 
mutual funds, means that you drop your savings rate and the money leaves," he 
said. And, he said, competition for mortgage business is stiff enough so that 
"if you change your mortgage rate, you won't originate any mortgages." If there 
is an increase, he said, "we absorb it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budgeted Amount Cited 
</P>
<P>
He noted that his group, which controls three S&amp;Ls, has budgeted $13 
million for deposit insurance premiums payable to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. but "may have to pay more." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who heads the congressional 
General Accounting Office, agreed that "there is a lot of pressure on the 
deposit rate" but predicted "a big effort" to pass on any increase in deposit 
insurance fees. 
</P>
<P>
There was no support on the ABC program for the idea, originally floated by the 
Treasury, of charging depositors 25 cents for every $100 in deposits, which 
Riegle called "a non-starter." 
</P>
<P>
But Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), the Senate's minority whip, refused to rule out 
the deposit fee. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to put all sorts of things on the table," Simpson said on NBC's 
"Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
Riegle argued that an effort should be made to extract as much money as 
possible from the S&amp;L industry, especially in cases in which funds have 
been siphoned off through fraud, before the taxpayers are asked to finance a 
bailout plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lending Reforms Sought 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher strongly supported this approach but emphasized that reforms in lending 
practices should be put in place before taxpayer funds are committed. 
</P>
<P>
Another guest on the ABC show, Edwin Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board, which regulates the savings industry, said the board had 
warned Congress "many times" of problems with the S&amp;L industry, recalling 
that he told the House Banking Committee in 1984 that "massive infusions" of 
Treasury funds "may well be necessary to shore up the system." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said "one of the big reasons" Congress failed to act "was that the 
powerful thrift lobby, with all of those contributions going to members of 
Congress, was stopping any action by the Congress to come to grips with it." 
</P>
<P>
Another panelist, Theo Pitt Jr., former chairman of the U.S. League of Savings 
Institutions, avoided direct comment on the charge. Instead, he called 
attention to congressional decisions, starting in the late 1970s, to deregulate 
interest rates and to "put us back in the position to be competitive because of 
the rapid run-up in interest rates." He said the industry warned Congress 
several times and asked for authorization to offer adjustable rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
If these requests had been granted, he said, "we wouldn't be in the mess we're 
in today."

It came to Ferdinand Marcos like a shiver in the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I am president. I am the most powerful man in the Philippines. All that I have 
dreamt of I have," he wrote one April morning early in his second term as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"More accurately, I have all the material things I want of life -- a wife who 
is loving and is a partner in the things I do, bright children who will carry 
my name, a life well lived, all. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel a discontent." 
</P>
<P>
At the pinnacle of his political career, Marcos remained a man hungry for power 
and the validation of history -- a man frustrated by the limitations of 
democracy. Whispering the future, his discontent would grow into the full 
misery of defeat and disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Ally, Special Problem 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand E. Marcos, special ally of the United States, would become its 
special problem. He would turn an American-tailored democracy into a 
dictatorship, be driven into exile, take refuge in Hawaii and, finally, be 
accused by a U.S. grand jury of plundering his homeland and the Filipino 
people. 
</P>
<P>
A photocopy of more than 2,500 pages of his handwritten diary was obtained by 
The Times through Manila government sources. A spokesman for Marcos said the 
former president could not comment because of ill health. In the past, Marcos 
objected to The Times' publication of excerpts from this diary as part of a 
story detailing his plans to declare martial law. He called that story an 
"invasion of privacy."

The Marcos diary, apparently abandoned when he fled Manila in February, 1986, 
was discovered about a year ago, sources said, by Philippine government 
investigators. The journal was known to exist because Marcos previously had 
shown portions of it to diplomats and at least one journalist. Its original 
pages, handwritten mostly in blue and black ink, were found in 30 file boxes 
stored in the care of presidential security officials, the sources told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Security 
</P>
<P>
Most of the entries after the mid-1970s are missing. The sources who provided 
the documents deleted additional pages, in part, they said, to protect 
Philippine national security. 
</P>
<P>
Sample pages of the photocopy have been inspected by an expert in document 
authentication, who found "virtually everything" about the samples consistent 
with documented examples of Marcos' handwriting. Because the sources could 
provide only photocopies -- and no access to the original diary pages in Manila 
-- the expert could not rule out the possibility of some inauthentic pages 
being added. However, to ensure accuracy, The Times independently verified 
details from historical accounts and through interviews with participants in 
events Marcos described. 
</P>
<P>
The diary offers a unique insight into the Marcos personality. It shows the 
hidden traits of a dictator whom the United States and five of its Presidents 
-- beginning with Lyndon B. Johnson and ending with Ronald Reagan -- considered 
a valued Pacific partner. It demonstrates that it was Marcos' personality, as 
much as his country's overwhelming social problems, that made this alliance 
problematic from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' journal reveals an insecure but ambitious man who fell easy prey to the 
temptation of unchecked authoritarian power. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction of authoritarianism haunted Marcos for many months before the 
end of 1972, when he finally imposed martial law, arrested hundreds of his 
critics and political opponents and established what he would call a 
"democratic dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
When he expressed his discontent on that morning of April 3, 1971, he was 
already well on his way toward declaring martial law. Here, from the diary of a 
dictator, is a story of how his fascination with authoritarian rule moved from 
fantasy to reality. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a landslide victory in his campaign for an unprecedented second term as 
president, Marcos did not enjoy any honeymoon in the days following his Jan. 1, 
1970, inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
The press reported allegations of corruption and election fraud; a soothsayer 
predicted he would be assassinated before spring; there were rumors of a 
planned U.S.-supported military coup, and violent street demonstrations drove 
both Marcos and his wife, Imelda, into seclusion inside Malacanang Palace in 
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, workers hastily constructed fortifications against mob assaults. 
Inside, Marcos tried on bulletproof vests. He was a virtual prisoner of 
Malacanang when, shortly before midnight, Marcos wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
January 28, 1970 
</P>
<P>
"The pattern of subversion is slowly emerging. The danger is now apparent to me 
but not to most people. (I see) the conspiracy to grab power and assassinate me 
... the terrorism ... the pink intellectuals, writers, professors and students 
and fellow travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I am certain this is just the beginning. The newspapermen I have on my 
list are busy placing the government in disrepute and holding it in contempt 
before the people. . . . The slow chipping at the people's confidence in 
government authority (will continue). 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not prepare measures of counteraction, (Communist subversives) will 
not only succeed in assassinating me but in taking over the government. So we 
must perfect our emergency plan." 
</P>
<P>
 This "emergency plan" became a constantly evolving contingency plan for 
martial law. And Marcos became ever more suspicious of others -- so much so 
that he began to believe that even priests and nuns were dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Nuns, he wrote, reportedly have threatened taxi drivers with bodily harm to 
force them to demonstrate against the government. 
</P>
<P>
"A little unbelievable, but . . . now the priests and nuns are using goons." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year Marcos flirted with the notion of dictatorship. At one 
point, when anti-Marcos protests reached a peak, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
February 17, 1970 
</P>
<P>
"I have that feeling of certainty that I will end up with dictatorial powers if 
the situation continues -- and the situation will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (leftist radicals) will continue to try to bring about a revolutionary 
situation. Massive sabotage is indicated by the crude bombs they are 
manufacturing. . . . They are not getting any aid (military) from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should allow them to gather strength but not such strength that we cannot 
overcome them." 
</P>
<P>
According to the diary, many of Marcos' closest aides encouraged "sterner 
measures" to put down the unrest. Imelda told him that dictatorships were the 
best form of government for developing nations; his military advisers endorsed 
martial law, and he was told that Latin American ambassadors were "all for" a 
Philippine strongman. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos drew up secret plans for a military takeover and slipped an unsigned 
declaration of martial law into a palace safe. It would be signed, he said, if 
anyone tried to assassinate him. 
</P>
<P>
As the new year approached, fraught with problems, a self-righteous Marcos 
blamed everyone but himself: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
December 30-31, 1970 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly our society is sick and the government muddles on. ... The 
legislature (is) . . . arrogant and vain. The city people are more interested 
in gossip than in achievements. The media is sensationalist and deliberately 
distorts and even falsifies news in order to raise a headline. The businessmen 
are not interested in the plight of the common people but are obsessed with 
amassing wealth. The oligarchs are at their favorite pastime to get the levers 
of power. The opposition party is irresponsible and didn't care less whether 
what they do would prejudice the people provided it enhances their chances to 
return to power. All our attempts at progress are deliberately blocked. Even 
the radicals seek nothing but power for power's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pre-dawn darkness of New Year's morning, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I am reviewing the contingency plan for the proclamation of martial law if the 
occasion demands it. ... As we were gathered to await the new year .. I 
wondered whether the year 1971 would usher in an authoritarian government in 
the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
By early 1971, Marcos believed not only that the country needed a "benevolent 
dictator," but also that martial law was the "Christian solution." If massive 
sabotage and terrorism occurred, he would impose authoritarian rule. It seemed 
inevitable, and Marcos was, by then, entranced by the prospect. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 21, 1971 
</P>
<P>
"Played golf this morning. I must be out of form. The coolness of the past 
several weeks has given way to a humid sultriness that weakened me in the 
second nine when I was practically dragging myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I go through these days with a feeling of unreality, as if it were a 
dream or drama of which you already know the ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus we all go through the required rituals or ceremonials of our respective 
roles when we know that ultimately there must be a military confrontation and 
the Communists or revolutionists who have already pledged to mount a revolution 
must do so while I wait for the right moment when I must proclaim martial law 
and practically take over the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime we must fence and hedge and dissimulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have a feeling that all these tentative efforts of ours are futile and 
that all further efforts will be frustrated. . . . So there actually is no 
alternative but to push the situation into its logical conclusion -- the 
denouement of a military confrontation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
During the spring, Marcos convened a secret meeting in the palace library with 
his top military advisers and predicted that Communist radicals would try to 
burn Manila during the summer. He told his generals that he intended to meet 
this violence with a declaration of martial law. He noted: No one objected. 
</P>
<P>
But when months went by without the predicted trouble, Marcos authorized the 
military to "stimulate" the radicals "into violence." 
</P>
<P>
Violence came in August, but it was directed at his political opponents. 
Unidentified assailants threw grenades into a crowd of 10,000 at Plaza Miranda 
during a campaign rally in Manila for Liberal Party Senate candidates. A bomb 
exploded beneath the speaker's stand. Nine people were killed, including a 
child. All eight Liberal candidates were seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
A Marcos loyalist defected to the Liberals, saying publicly what American 
intelligence agents were saying privately: The bombing was the handiwork of the 
Philippine military. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos insisted that a Communist insurrection had been launched. He curbed 
civil liberties nationwide, authorizing arrests without warrants. The next 
afternoon, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
August 21, 1971 
</P>
<P>
"I have declared by proclamation No. 889 a suspension of the privilege of the 
writ of habeas corpus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This after the police ... and others agree that the bombing of the LP rally 
at Plaza Miranda ... was caused or done by subversives... . 
</P>
<P>
 "Such a grave and heinous crime must be met with decisive action on the part 
of government. Otherwise our democracy is doomed. (Defense) Secretary (Juan) 
Ponce Enrile was for outright declaration of martial law. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Gen. Ramos drew up the list of persons to be arrested. . . . Sen. (Benigno 
S.) Aquino who was absent from the platform during the bombing (suspiciously 
so) is the prime suspect as the mastermind . . . of the whole dastardly plot. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Aquino is the most ruthless man in the Philippines today." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Aquino, then husband of current Philippine President Corazon 
Aquino, would be shot to death -- it is widely alleged by Marcos' supporters. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, less than three months after suspending civil liberties, Marcos 
was stunned by an election debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Party senatorial candidates, wounded in the Plaza Miranda bombing, 
campaigned in wheelchairs, splints and bandages. Marcos had declared that the 
election would be a referendum on his leadership and the policies of his 
Nationalist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberals won overwhelmingly, even defeating Marcos candidates in the 
president's home province. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Marcos blamed sympathy for the bombing's victims, soaring prices, a 
rice shortage, the clergy and a "vicious media." But a week after the election, 
Marcos decided that the Philippine public was not smart enough for democracy. 
He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
November 14, 1971 
</P>
<P>
"For the last several days, I have been overwhelmed by a sense of frustration 
because of the implications of the senatorial elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the emotional issue of Plaza Miranda and the bombing was something that 
would catch the imagination of the people, we underestimated the capacity of 
the media to spread it all the way down to the barrios. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the results indicate that the people still do not have the wisdom and the 
discrimination required for a truly democratic republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the demagogues and the simpletons were elected instead of the highly 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the consequences may be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now fear for our Republic." 
</P>
<P>
As the year waned, Marcos wondered whether anyone could solve the nation's 
economic and social problems unless he is a "dictator for at least a short 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos turned to history for the counsel of past conquerors. He read about 
Napoleon and how he ascended to dictatorship. He studied the lessons of 
Hitler's failures. Frequently, he came back to one of his favorite historical 
figures -- Julius Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing a John Gielgud-Marlon Brando film of Caesar's life and 
assassination, Marcos noted: 
</P>
<P>
 "Reminded me of the conspiracy going on now against me by all the envious men 
who have failed. Remind me to have my guards around me always. I have often 
wondered why Caesar had no protection when he was assassinated." 
</P>
<P>
 And while discussing violence and social unrest in the United States, he 
mused: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
February 20, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"At what point of anarchy would a Julius Caesar take over the (U.S.) government 
as a dictator? Although . . . it may be difficult to control the U.S. from one 
central point as it has too many centers of power." 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered whether in the United States, the Philippines or any other country 
"the old concepts of democracy and freedom are still valid or whether 
dictatorship or authoritarianism is not demanded for survival." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he read a book about how, 2,020 years before, Caesar had led his army 
across the Rubicon River to seize dictatorial control of the Roman Empire. And 
Marcos pondered the rhetorical question: 
</P>
<P>
"Who waits beyond our Rubicon?" 
</P>
<P>
In other pages of his diary, he associated himself with De Gaulle, Prometheus, 
Alexander the Great, Christ and Churchill. And he grew increasingly preoccupied 
with his own historical self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often wonder what I will be remembered in history for. Scholar? Military 
hero? Builder? The new constitution? Reorganization of government? Builder of 
roads, schools? ... Uniter of the variant and antagonistic elements of our 
people. He brought light to a dark country? Strong rallying point or a weak 
tyrant? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "History should not be left to the historians. Rather be like Churchill. Make 
history, and then write it." 
</P>
<P>
But he remained painfully aware that he was the ruler of a lesser power. 
</P>
<P>
He hired a scientist who had a "new way to split the atom" -- it sounded like a 
scheme closer to alchemy than physics. 
</P>
<P>
And he started a missile program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a launcher on a dump truck." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1972, Marcos became obsessed with the business of a 
constitutional convention that was considering changes in the Philippine system 
of government. The old constitution barred him from a third term. Without a 
change, Marcos could not retain the presidency unless he invoked martial law to 
seize the government. 
</P>
<P>
Drafting the new constitution was a slow, frustrating and scandal-ridden 
process. An impatient Marcos turned to God for a sign that martial law had the 
blessing of providence. 
</P>
<P>
It came at a religious retreat -- a priest's theological lesson on the subject 
of authority was interpreted as "the sign." And Marcos, in a rambling 
"Spiritual Exercises on the Specific Problems of Martial Law," wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 28, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the Lord for a sign. And he has given it. In the meditation this 
morning the following thoughts were brought out. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'My job is too heavy. But your will and not mine be done.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The permissiveness of society must be balanced with authoritativeness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it for the glory of God that there be authoritativeness? Yes, for we 
return order where there is chaos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "And the permissiveness of our society has spawned the many evils that will 
wreck our Republic. It must now be balanced with authoritativeness -- and that 
is martial law. However, I put as a condition the occurrence of massive 
terrorism, which would alarm the people as well as the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Adapting another religious exercise to his martial law meditations, Marcos 
compared freedom with a diet of meat, which sometimes may not be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I conclude that freedom is not always good. There may be periods in a 
country's life when it is like meat. For the time being, it must be curtailed 
or denied." 
</P>
<P>
 He waxed messianic. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'This is your principal mission in life -- save the country again from the 
Maoists, the anarchists and the radicals.' This is the message that I deduce 
from the visions that I see asleep and awake. 'Subordinate everything to this,' 
God seems to be saying to me. 'And you are the only person who can do it,' He 
says. 'Nobody else can. So do not miss the opportunity given you. ...' " 
</P>
<P>
 His messianic visions took on an eerie mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
At Mass on his birthday, Marcos wrote, "I could feel I was in communication 
with my Creator. The sermon on being alone was apropos. And as I prayed, I felt 
tears springing to my eyes from the joy of communication. I was on the verge, I 
believe, of one of those mystic seizures where the spirit lifts up from the 
body." 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Marcos denied he would try to extend his term in office, either by 
pushing for a temporary extension through the constitutional convention or by 
having Imelda run as a surrogate presidential candidate. Privately, however, he 
was gripped by a paranoia that his very life might depend on retaining the 
presidency. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May 25, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"I am now convinced that even if we retire peacefully we will be hunted and 
killed by the Communists or the political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "So there may be no other option but to wait until the Communists start their 
urban operations making it necessary to declare martial law." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos' fear of physical danger became a preoccupation that verged on 
hypochondria. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, he measured his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
He complained of a pain in the groin, broken teeth, indigestion -- "relieved by 
three doses of Gelusil." 
</P>
<P>
One weekend he watched a pornographic movie. "The girls were completely nude, 
pubic hair and all, which disgusted me and actually gave me a stomach ache." He 
took two doses of Gelusil and an electrocardiogram. 
</P>
<P>
He got a backache and summoned a doctor. "His diagnosis . . . is the soft, 
lumpy bed." 
</P>
<P>
 He got a summer cold. "I called a conference of doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Marcos yielded to the temptation of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Under his direction, martial law planning shifted to a frenetic pace. An 
enemies list was drafted of "target personalities" to be arrested. The most 
loyal generals were to monitor other less-trusted generals. The military would 
oversee the media. The plan was code-named (and misspelled): "Sagittarius." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos asked American Ambassador Henry A. Byroade whether the Nixon 
Adminstration would "atleast remain neutral" if martial law was needed to curb 
Communist expansion in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He answered that his government will support my move. But I noticed a 
hesitancy . . . indicating that he would prefer to have (the controversy) 
avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos was irritated by U.S. intelligence reports that there were no more than 
100 armed rebels in the Philippines, that Red China was not helping the rebels 
and that Communist insurgents posed little, if any, threat. An angry Marcos 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
August 27, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. State Department has a consistent record of error in the assessment 
of Asian situations and judging Red Chinese intentions. It is preposterous, 
therefore, for them to lecture to us on their estimate of the threat we face 
from the local Communists. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "How stupid can they get?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors swept Manila and Washington that martial law was imminent. The United 
States sent a fact-finding mission led by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), to 
assess the aftermath of a typhoon -- and the political storm warnings over the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
At the palace, where Marcos aides were drafting takeover plans in another room, 
Inouye pressed Marcos about reports that he would try to retain office despite 
the constitutional limit. A disingenuous Marcos recorded: 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me what is going to happen. He explained that he has been told there 
are four options: 1. Extension of my term, 2. A parliamentary form of 
government, 3. I run for reelection, 4. Martial law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately countered that I do not need martial law to win an election and 
that in the present situation anybody I supported would come out (winning); 
that I would not agree to allowing the First Lady to run since it would be 
unfair to her. 'We are too old in this game to need martial law to get votes,' 
I said, and he smiled with understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'However,' I explained, 'do not misunderstand me. If the Communists sow 
terror in Manila; if they bomb and burn, kill and kidnap, if they use the Viet 
Cong tactics, then I will not hesitate to proclaim martial law.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bombs went off around the city, causing damage but few injuries. Critics said 
the military had done it. Marcos said "there is hysteria in Manila" that might 
force him to put his plans for martial law into effect soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the floor of the Philippine senate, Benigno Aquino revealed the 
existence of "Sagittarius," igniting a new burst of press and political 
criticism. Public support for Marcos appeared to be slipping. It was time for 
Marcos to wade into the Rubicon. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour meeting with top military aides he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
September 13, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"We finalized the plans for the proclamation of martial law.... They all agreed 
(that) the earlier we do it the better because the media is waging a propaganda 
campaign that distorts and twists the facts, and they may succeed in weakening 
our support among the people if it is allowed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finalized the target personalities, the assignments and the procedures." 
</P>
<P>
They also set the date: martial law would be declared Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Sept. 21 was a date divisible by Marcos' favorite number: 7. 
</P>
<P>
He won his first nomination for president by 777 votes. He named his yacht the 
President 777. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Byroade called on Marcos at the palace at 11:15 a.m. on Sept. 21. 
While they conferred, Marcos aides feverishly typed the final martial law 
proclamation and various presidential orders. Marcos noted: 
</P>
<P>
 "(He) was apparently interested to know whether there would be martial law. He 
seemed to favor it when I explained it is intended to primarily reform our 
society and eliminate the Communist threat. But he suggested that a 
proclamation before the American elections may be used by (George S.) McGovern, 
the Democratic presidential candidate, as proof of the failure of (Nixon's) 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I did not want it said that he was intervening in internal matters 
of the Philippine government and that no decision has been arrived at, but ... 
there seemed no other solution." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper work was finished by 8 p.m. All that remained was an act of 
insurrection to justify the order. It would come in exactly 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
As Defense Secretary Enrile's blue Ford with the tinted windows was escorted 
past the Wack Wack golf course, it was hit by gunfire. He was unharmed, having 
chosen this night to ride with his escorts. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Enrile would admit the attack was staged. But at 9:55 that night, 
Marcos turned to page 2332 of his diary to write: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
September 22, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential order had already been issued -- backdated to Sept. 21. 
Before dawn 50 people, mostly journalists and political opponents -- including 
Benigno Aquino -- were arrested without warrants. 
</P>
<P>
All demonstrations stopped. Democracy stopped. A triumphant Marcos wrote: "I am 
some kind of hero!" 
</P>
<P>
The new dictator confronted a delegation of Philippine Supreme Court justices, 
declaring he would ignore any ruling challenging the constitutionality of 
martial law. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
September 24, 1972 
</P>
<P>
"They . . . do not understand that a new day has dawned."

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a scene to conjure with -- Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the 
baronial chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, bouncing on the Lincoln bed 
in the upper reaches of the White House with his wife, Peatsy, while President 
Bush snapped their picture. 
</P>
<P>
His honeymoon with Congress may be short-lived, but at least for now, George 
Bush's skillful use of such personal touches -- coupled with a barrage of 
disarming rhetoric -- has some of the most powerful congressional Democrats all 
but eating out of his hand. And the capital is caught up in a new spirit of 
bipartisanship not seen for a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The personal touch makes a real difference," said Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "It doesn't change folks' 
positions, but it makes them willing to sit down and talk with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a leader of the Democrats' liberal wing, 
said Bush "is building up respect for a willingness to listen and that goes a 
long way. We have our differences, but he is helping us try to find middle 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
Few expect the new bipartisanship to last indefinitely or eliminate the 
all-too-real disagreements that exist on critical national issues. Some wonder 
whether it can even survive past next Thursday, when Bush lays out his policy 
agenda and the details of his position on the federal budget before a joint 
session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But after 12 years of often-rocky relations with the Ronald Reagan and Jimmy 
Carter administrations, congressional leaders appear to welcome the possibility 
of less confrontational dealings with the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Democrats said they are relieved to be dealing with a President 
who shows interest in them and their work and understands Congress as an 
institution. Bush's background as a former Texas congressman is seen as giving 
him a degree of understanding and respect for the role of Congress that many of 
his predecessors lacked. 
</P>
<P>
The new atmosphere on Capitol Hill "is for real," said Nunn, "because we've got 
somebody in the White House now who's listening to people in Congress and that 
makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstrates Interest 
</P>
<P>
Calling Bush's approach "beyond bipartisanship," Kennedy said the President 
"has demonstrated an accessibility and an interest in Congress and an 
understanding of it as an institution that we haven't seen in a long time -- at 
least since President Ford." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald R. Ford had been a member of Congress, of course, and Carter and Reagan 
are, as Kennedy pointed out, "not of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush has sometimes portrayed his appeals for bipartisanship as a 
return to traditional values, bipartisanship as "a big idea" in American 
politics did not take hold until President Franklin D. Roosevelt's appeals to 
Congress for cooperation during the Great Depression of the 1930s, according to 
James David Barber, a presidential scholar at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis of the Depression was so severe and Roosevelt so 
persuasive, Barber said, that House members shouted, "vote, vote" and quickly 
passed the economic measures Roosevelt sent to Capitol Hill. Otherwise, 
bipartisanship has seldom taken hold on domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goal Seldom Realized 
</P>
<P>
It prevailed in foreign affairs during World War II and afterward during much 
of Harry S. Truman's second Administration, but even in the sensitive area of 
foreign affairs bipartisanship has been a goal presidents have more often 
expressed than fully realized. 
</P>
<P>
On the foreign relations front, however, Bush's call for bipartisanship may 
already be paying some concrete dividends. While declining to reveal specifics, 
Nunn said the President's private sessions with Democratic senators has brought 
the Administration a step closer to achieving a consensus on the thorny problem 
of South Africa's system of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas has spoken of "earnestly" sharing Bush's goal 
of a bipartisan foreign policy and has announced several initiatives to show 
"good faith" on the Democrats' part. And he has expressed optimism about 
reaching a bipartisan consensus on how to end the bloody conflict in Nicaragua, 
which was the source of bitterly partisan fights during the eight-year Reagan 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The new atmosphere was reflected at a dinner party hosted by Kennedy at his 
spacious home in nearby Maclean, Va., several nights ago. 
</P>
<P>
Attended by leaders of both parties, the dinner was a tribute to a man who 
personifies bipartisanship: Max M. Kampelman, a longtime Democrat who is 
retiring after serving as the Reagan Administration's chief arms negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests: Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and Senate Democratic 
Whip Alan Cranston of California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker Consults Cranston 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the party, Baker pulled Cranston aside to assure him that 
the Administration agreed with his strong statements denouncing right-wing 
death squads in El Salvador and the recurrence of violence against leftist 
opposition leaders there. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told Cranston, who was obviously pleased at being consulted, that Vice 
President Quayle, who was leaving the next morning on a trip to Latin America, 
would carry "a very strong message" about the violence to military leaders in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Kennedy, Cranston and other Democratic leaders raved about the 
red-carpet treatment Bush had rolled out at the White House for officials of 
both parties at a reception earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The guided tour of the White House for leaders of both parties and their wives, 
conducted by Bush and his wife, Barbara, gave a grateful Cranston the first 
look he had had of upstairs at the White House in his 20 years in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For an equally grateful Kennedy, it was his first view of the residential 
quarters since his brother John was President in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking with business leaders invited to the White House for lunch 
Friday, pointed out that he is "the product of Congress in some ways" and said 
he realizes he will have differences with Congress when he outlines his 
proposals on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sending Confusing Signals' 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is serious about consulting and listening to Congress because 
"it'll be good for domestic policy, and I'm absolutely convinced that it is 
vital for foreign policy because we've been sending confusing signals around 
the world of two major branches of government that can't ever quite get 
together on something important." 
</P>
<P>
While wooing Democrats, Bush also has felt compelled to stroke the feathers of 
right-wing members of his own party in the House who have served notice they 
will not support the President on policies that veer from conservative 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will "remain true to conservative ideas," insisted Frederick D. McClure, 
the President's assistant for congressional liaison, while also continuing to 
reach out to "all spectrums" on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
McClure conceded that Bush's proposals on Thursday may be a serious test for 
his bipartisanship campaign, but added: "I wouldn't say all hell's going to 
break loose because while he's going to make some tough choices, he's going to 
try to keep his approach as bipartisan as he can." 
</P>
<P>
Several senators contrasted Bush's approach to Congress with that of Carter and 
Reagan, who they felt never fully understood or appreciated the institution. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who had fought constantly with the Legislature when he served as 
governor of Georgia, ran into difficulty from the outset of his presidency, 
fulfilling a prophecy of a longtime aide who expressed concern Carter would 
treat Congress like it was the Georgia Legislature and Congress would treat him 
like he was Georgia's governor. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan parlayed his popularity with voters into congressional support 
for his economics program early in his first term, he and Congress were 
constantly at loggerheads in the second term. In the first term, Reagan charmed 
key members of Congress with a great deal of personal attention, but when 
things turned sour in the second term he began to ignore them and frequently 
attacked Congress on domestic and foreign issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush does not mind giving credit to Congress for the vital role it plays in 
government, according to several senators. "I think it was Woodrow Wilson," 
said Kennedy, "who said, 'There's no end to what can be achieved in this city 
if one is willing to give credit to others.' Bush understands that." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Democratic leaders are so sanguine about Bush's overtures to Congress. 
Hollings expressed concern that Democrats are "so intoxicated with this 
honeymoon that Bush may believe he can finesse the budget situation for another 
four years the way Ronald Reagan did for eight years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk of Tour 
</P>
<P>
Hollings and his wife enjoyed the White House tour. At Kennedy's dinner party 
they talked enthusiastically of how Bush snapped their photo as they bounced on 
the bed where Abraham Lincoln slept. 
</P>
<P>
But the senator said the way he sees it, "this stroking by Bush is just to get 
us to go along with this charade of saying no new taxes when we know we have to 
have new revenue to solve our budget problems." 
</P>
<P>
And Senate Majority Leader Mitchell insisted Congress will not "be lulled by 
the current relations and atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere will be better throughout the Bush term because he's a 
different person from Reagan and much more likely to sustain a positive 
relationship with the Congress," Mitchell said, "although there will certainly 
be substantial differences on specific issues."

TALKS BEGIN ON TEACHER SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Los Angeles Unified School District board and its 
teachers' union went into negotiations at school district headquarters Sunday 
in an effort to end their yearlong labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
After about four hours, the head of the teachers' union, Wayne Johnson, emerged 
to say that he would "pull the plug" on the talks if more rapid progress was 
not made quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the teachers, who have been seeking a 12% one-year pay increase, 
had reduced their demand to 11%. But he said no counter offer had been received 
from the school board, which had retired to a closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
The entire school board and officers of the union were in attendance. A state 
mediator was shuttling information between the two sides. The talks had been 
billed as face-to-face, around-the-clock negotiations, but as of Sunday 
evening, Johnson, school board President Roberta Weintraub and their respective 
aides had not sat down together.

SNOW FALLS IN WIDE AREA AS MERCURY DIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Arctic air continued to assault Southern California on Sunday, bringing reports 
of snowfall in low-lying areas from Riverside to Orange County, keeping high 
temperatures at record or near-record low levels and prompting officials to 
issue freeze warnings for some agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature at Lindbergh Field in San Diego was 54 degrees. The 
mercury at UC Riverside only reached 47, shattering the old low maximum of 51 
degrees set in 1949. The peak reading of 53 degrees recorded at the Los Angeles 
Civic Center was only 1 degree warmer than the coldest high for the date, 
recorded in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
Snow showers were reported in the San Bernardino Valley, and snow stuck to the 
ground for a time near Rancho Cucamonga, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Mid-20s 
</P>
<P>
March Air Force Base, near Riverside, reported snow showers at 1,500 feet 
elevation, and snow also fell in the Orange County community of Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were expected to drop into the mid-20s this morning and Tuesday, 
prompting the weather service to issue a frost advisory for inland valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Cold air moved into San Diego County with the weather service saying that the 
coldest inland areas will drop to the upper 20s. Agricultural interests in 
those areas were alerted to take measures to protect crops from frost since the 
temperature was expected to fall below freezing early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight will be even colder, the weather service said, as lows drop to the low 
and middle 20s. The frost advisory will remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Two inches of snow fell on Mt. Laguna Sunday, and hail was reported at 
Montgomery Field. No rain or snow is expected to fall today, but the cool 
temperatures will remain. The high at Mt. Laguna Sunday was 27. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, light snow covered the higher hills of the San 
Francisco Bay Area Sunday after overnight temperatures dipped below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
Snow was also reported at sea level in Marin County for the first time in 13 
years. Two inches fell at Dillon Beach and children made a small snowman at 
Agate Beach in the coastal town of Bolinas. 
</P>
<P>
Record low temperatures were reported in Red Bluff, where the mercury hit 22 
degrees early Sunday morning, the coldest in 100 years. A bone-chilling 21 
degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 16 degrees below zero, was recorded in 
Redding. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers closed the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 
through the Tejon Pass and the Tehachapis on Sunday morning after snowplows 
were unable to keep the highway clear during a steady snowfall. The freeway, 
the main artery between the northern and southern halves of the state, was 
reopened to traffic at 2 p.m. when weather conditions improved. 
</P>
<P>
High temperatures in the Los Angeles Basin will be in the mid-50s today and 
tomorrow, with northeast winds gusting up to 25 m.p.h. below the canyons, said 
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury will move up a degree or two on Wednesday, Dittmann said, but "the 
rest of the week is unsettled. Storms now over the Pacific are headed toward 
Southern California, and we may see wet weather for most of the region from 
Wednesday through Friday."

HE SEES 'MORE OF A CONFLICT' THAN PERSONAL LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
SIMPSON CONCERNED OVER FEES TO TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Minority Whip Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said Sunday that he sees "more of 
a conflict" in Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's receipt of more than 
$750,000 from Pentagon contractors than in allegations about the nominee's 
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's heavy bucks, and people just don't understand that part," Simpson said 
of Tower's lobbying and consulting fees from six defense contractors from 1986 
through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's comments on NBC's "Meet the Press" are significant both because of 
his Republican leadership role and his friendship with President Bush, with 
whom he went fishing shortly after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's concern over the appearance of conflict in Tower's moving from a 
lucrative business relationship with arms makers to presiding over billions of 
dollars of defense contracting came amid indications that FBI agents have 
turned up nothing significant in checking on recent personal allegations that 
delayed a committee vote on his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interviews 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Tower said the FBI had found nothing, but still has a couple 
of interviews to conduct, probably today. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has been conducting a round-the-clock inquiry since Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, called off a scheduled 
committee vote on Tower's nomination and referred new allegations of 
drunkenness and personal misconduct to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
With some interviews still to be conducted this week, an Administration source 
said the latest charges "just aren't shaking out." 
</P>
<P>
Tower's claim to the committee that he has moderated his drinking and now 
indulges only in an occasional glass of wine could be called into question by 
some of the findings, the Administration source said. "But they haven't found 
anything that would be regarded as debilitating or outrageous public 
drunkenness," the source added. 
</P>
<P>
Although FBI agents in Houston questioned members of Houston's Soviet emigre 
community extensively, it was understood they found no support for the 
allegation that Tower had an affair with a Soviet-born ballerina there. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration source said that unless new information surfaces, the FBI 
report could be completed by midweek, making possible a committee vote this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appearance of Conflict 
</P>
<P>
Simpson made his comments when asked if Tower's receiving $763,777 in defense 
consulting and lobbying fees raised the problem of the appearance of conflict 
and meant that he would be recusing himself from dealing with the defense 
contractors to the degree "that he can't really be secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . You are absolutely right, it is the appearance over everything in this 
community," Simpson answered. 
</P>
<P>
People would "say, 'Wait a minute, if you come up with that same person you're 
dealing with (on) procurement, isn't that a conflict?' " Simpson said. "And I 
think that's more of a conflict than anything with regard to his personality." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said the committee is "probably going to approve him and I think they 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Tower said they did not read Simpson's comments about the 
appearance of conflict as a signal of weakening support for the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said that 
all Republicans on the panel are in line behind Tower despite Simpson's 
assessment Sunday. "There is no carping, no hand-wringing," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said the most recent allegations against Tower were "wild 
and arresting. If they're true, it's the end." But, he noted, the charges "are 
easily provable or disprovable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severed Ties 
</P>
<P>
In testifying Jan. 26 before the Senate committee about his consulting and 
lobbying fees, Tower said he has severed all ties to the six contractors and 
that his decisions as defense secretary will not be swayed by past 
affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be people who will suspect anyone who has been formerly 
associated with the defense industry," Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
The former Texas senator promised to "bend over backwards" to avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict of interest, and said that he would remove himself 
from decisions that could result in a former client's being suspended or barred 
from doing business with the federal government.

BRITAIN TO PROBE CHARGES THAT WWII HERO ORDERED GERMAN PRISONERS SHOT

<P>
The Ministry of Defense said Sunday it will investigate allegations that 
Britain's most decorated World War II hero ordered the machine-gunning of seven 
German prisoners in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the charges have been leveled against retired Rear Adm. 
Anthony Miers, who died three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Miers received a Victoria Cross -- Britain's highest decoration for valor -- 
three weeks after the officer, who was then a lieutenant, allegedly ordered the 
crew of his submarine Torbay to shoot the Germans, who were cast adrift in a 
dinghy after the British submarine sank a freighter off Crete. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the alleged killings were first published in a recent book by 
Ludovic Kennedy, who said they were ordered by a war hero but did not name him. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper named Miers in its latest edition and Kennedy 
confirmed it. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the killing of the seven prisoners was similar to war crimes 
for which several German submarine commanders were tried and executed. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet-ridden bodies were found by the Germans and may have led to brutal 
treatment meted out to captured British commandos in the area afterward.

HOMELESS AID BILLS VIE FOR TIGHT FEDERAL DOLLARS

<P>
President Bush has called it a disgrace. Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp has vowed it will be his top priority. And Barbara Bush, 
calling on the nation's volunteer spirit, has visited a community center to 
make sandwiches for homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to a growing belief that the Bush Administration -- backed by 
Congress -- will go beyond rhetoric this year and expand the federal 
government's commitment to easing the problem of homelessness. Just how much is 
another question, however. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush sounds more helpful than the previous Administration, but 
that's easy," said Maria Foscarinis, general counsel to the National Coalition 
for the Homeless. "I think everybody's waiting to see what he puts on the 
bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledged Full Funding 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is to unveil his budget revisions Thursday, during the campaign 
pledged full funding of the McKinney Homeless Act, which supports temporary 
programs ranging from emergency housing for families to soup kitchens and 
shelters for the homeless. Last year, Congress released only 60% of the money 
originally authorized for these programs, and additional federal cuts have 
taken a heavy toll in California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, for example, California's share of federal funds to help 
homeless mentally ill people plummeted to $258,000 from $6 million the year 
before. In Los Angeles, those cuts threaten to shut down new programs to offer 
shelter beds in Venice and professional staffing of a Skid Row hotel that 
caters to the homeless. In San Diego, programs of counseling for homeless women 
are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"When the federal money goes, so do the programs funded with those monies," 
said Roberto Quiroz, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental 
Health. "Those cutbacks, coupled with our own local budget cuts, mean we have 
an impending crisis on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Now, some members of Congress have introduced legislation for full financial 
backing of the McKinney law. They say it is time for Washington to keep its 
promise to the homeless, but they are unsure whether Bush will agree to so much 
new spending -- about $255 million this year -- given the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Others question how receptive Bush and Kemp will be to a bipartisan bill that 
would set aside $2 billion for renovation of about 280,000 units of public 
housing over two years. Sponsors estimate that the legislation, which seeks a 
more permanent solution to the crisis of homelessness, could make new housing 
available for nearly a million people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Past Good Feelings' 
</P>
<P>
"We're past the point of rhetoric and good feelings with this issue," said Rep. 
Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), who is sponsoring both proposals. "It's time for 
specifics." 
</P>
<P>
As speculation about the initiatives increases, much of the attention is on 
Kemp, who has promised to bring "new energy and new ideas" to the problem of 
homelessness. Although he is reluctant to discuss spending, Kemp said in an 
interview that the federal government has a major role to play. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the HUD secretary said, he would be exploring initiatives to 
help the homeless mentally ill, who make up between 20% and 25% of the homeless 
population. He noted that many of those now living on the streets were released 
from state mental hospitals during the "deinstitutionalization" programs of the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Those programs envisioned the construction of community-based homes for the 
former mental patients, Kemp said, "but that promise was never kept. There was 
a 1963 federal law passed to encourage the building of these centers, but they 
were never built. That's why I think we should find a way to get Congress and 
state governments back into this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp also said he would promote economic partnerships for homeless aid between 
government and the private sector. During a Christmas Eve visit to a community 
shelter, the former New York congressman said, he and his wife "saw the great 
possibilities" in the idea of developers, church groups and the federal 
government coming together to run such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, federal, state and local governments could help secure sites for 
shelters, he said. Other costs, such as personnel and security, would be borne 
by volunteer groups and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just not enough money in the federal Treasury to pay for all of those 
costs," Kemp said, "but imagine the possibilities if we got more churches 
involved, more synagogues, and families would each sponsor a homeless person. 
Imagine the work we could do!" 
</P>
<P>
Kemp conceded that many of those involved in aiding the homeless "felt 
neglected" by former President Ronald Reagan, who several times suggested that 
many people sleep on the streets because they choose to do so. Under Reagan, 
HUD's commitment to building housing for low-income people shrank to $7.12 
billion in 1987, from $32 billion in 1981, according to federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to use my role (at HUD) as a bully pulpit . . . to call attention to 
the problem, to marshal energies in government and in the private sector," Kemp 
said. "There are government programs that need to be utilized, and I'm 
certainly not an enemy of what works." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kemp was reluctant to discuss dollars and cents, and indicated that the 
Bush Administration would proceed cautiously in proposing new spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there needs that we should be addressing, areas where we should be doing 
more? Absolutely," he said, "but does that automatically mean new funding? 
Maybe, maybe not." 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, however, some members of both parties are convinced that the 
severity of the problem requires a greater government investment in solving it. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the homeless population range from 560,000 to nearly 3 million in 
recent surveys. The National Coalition for the Homeless has reported that Los 
Angeles, with an estimated 50,000 homeless people, has only 5,000 shelter beds 
available on any given night. Only New York City, which has between 70,000 and 
90,000 homeless residents, has more people on the street without permanent 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a report of the U. S. Conference of Mayors concluded that the 
McKinney Homeless Act was effective in meeting a variety of needs, even though 
it provided only temporary relief and was not fully financed. The mayors' 
report went on to say that the government should be addressing long-term 
problems such as the growing number of homeless families, mentally ill people 
living on the streets and the shortage of affordable rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates fear the homeless issue, because of its complexity, may get lost 
in the budget shuffle. Vento, for example, suggested that Bush "may want to 
talk about doing this (full funds for the McKinney Act) next year. That's what 
I fear, because this money is needed now." 
</P>
<P>
Others are not so pessimistic. In view of the President's pledge, "it's 
definitely in the realm of possibility" that emergency legislation will be 
passed, said an aide to Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N. M.), the ranking Republican 
on the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress authorized $1.3 billion for the McKinney Homeless Act, 
$633.5 million for the current year and $655.5 million for fiscal 1990. After 
budget cuts, however, only $378.23 million was released this year. In his last 
budget, Reagan recommended spending $310 million on homeless programs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A bill to restore the full amount of money, sponsored by Vento and 52 others, 
is expected to come up for a vote in April. Its backers are optimistic that it 
will pass, but they are less confident about a second, $2-billion proposal to 
build permanent housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
That bill, co-sponsored by Vento and Rep. Patricia Saiki (R-Hawaii), would 
authorize spending over the next two years to provide shelter for homeless 
people whose incomes are 50% or less of the median income in their area. It 
would upgrade and make use of vacant public housing and other rental properties 
-- a cost-effective approach, since the units are already in place, sponsors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"The virtue of this is that we're not re-inventing the wheel or setting up a 
new bureaucracy," said Saiki. "We're going to get a lot of bipartisan support 
for this because it's so logical. The investment has already been made to build 
these properties." 
</P>
<P>
As for the cost, Saiki acknowledged that "Republicans are naturally concerned 
about the deficit . . . but we're talking about fine-tuning existing programs 
here. It's just a matter of whether we can fit it into the total budget." 
</P>
<P>
Another complication may arise from rival housing legislation sponsored by 
Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). Under their 
bill, about $3 billion would be allocated to different groups, ranging from 
low-income tenants and renters to young families struggling to make down 
payments on first homes. 
</P>
<P>
With money for new programs so scarce, Congress may allocate funds to a variety 
of housing programs rather than to the homeless alone, Senate aides said. 
</P>
<P>
"These bills represent clearly different approaches, and I suspect you're not 
going to find the money for both," said one aide. "That $2-billion price tag 
(for the Vento-Saiki bill) is a pretty hefty amount. I don't know if that's the 
kind of thing the new Administration is really going to consider." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Congress expects Bush to deal with the homeless issue, and soon. 
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has sponsored several bills for the 
homeless, said he looks forward to a "solid, open dialogue" with Kemp and the 
Bush Administration.

A young professionals group is under investigation for raising up to $75,000 
through eight charity parties but donating just $3,565, a paper reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A judge ordered a bank account for the Boston Society of Young Professionals 
frozen last week, but no money was in it, said Joanna Soris, an assistant state 
attorney general. The probe began after two charities complained that they 
received no money. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of young professional singles over an 18-month period flocked to the 
benefits for the Jimmy Fund, a Boston children's charity, the U.S. Olympic Swim 
Team, the American Cancer Society and the Pine Street Inn, a shelter for the 
homeless, the Boston Sunday Herald reported.

JEWISH FUND DRIVE $1 MILLION OVER GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles' United Jewish Fund 
surpassed its fund-raising target by $1 million Sunday as more than 5,000 
volunteer telephone solicitors received pledges for $4 million during the 
12-hour campaign, council officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Super Sunday," the campaign raised money to fund a broad range of 
health, education, welfare and social service programs in Los Angeles, Israel 
and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign officials said a "significant" amount of the money raised will be used 
to help pay resettlement costs for between 3,000 and 5,000 Soviet Jews expected 
to arrive in the Southland this year.

OPERATORS AT HEART OF 911 SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS OF RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES DEPENDS ON HUMAN JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all their high-tech hardware and its ability to relay information in a 
split second, authorities acknowledge that the 911 emergency systems in Los 
Angeles County are only as good as the people who answer and say, "911 
emergency. What are you reporting?" 
</P>
<P>
From the huge communications center below Los Angeles City Hall to a small 
glass booth at the sheriff's station in the Santa Clarita Valley, 911 operators 
must make snap judgments on calls nearly every minute of the day. 
</P>
<P>
And it is in that oft-repeated human transaction that the system is most 
vulnerable to failure. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that we have the hardware, the most important thing is the human 
element," said Capt. Robert Spierer, Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
That was no more evident than at 10:36 p.m. on Jan. 20 when a veteran deputy 
and 911 operator at the Valencia sheriff's station said, "Have a nice day," and 
hung up on a man frantically trying to report a gang shooting and fearing for 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caller Not Injured 
</P>
<P>
The caller was not injured, but sheriff's officials acknowledged that he was a 
victim of human error -- the deputy made a snap judgment that 911 operators are 
trained not to make. He decided that a call for help was not legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, now the subject of an internal investigation, has raised 
questions about how 911 calls are handled and how system operators are trained. 
Though as many as one in four calls are pranks, one basic rule is that an 
operator should never terminate a call for urgent help because he suspects that 
it is bogus. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not our place to decide whether it is real," said Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. John Emerson, a communications room supervisor. "The caller could be lying 
through his teeth, but we have to take it at face value. We have no reason not 
to send a car." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities stress that the Jan. 20 incident does not indicate a larger 
problem. They say that only a few complaints about the handling of 911 calls 
have been made in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
All 911 calls in Los Angeles, including those from the San Fernando Valley, go 
to the Police Department's communications center four floors beneath City Hall. 
In a dimly lit room nearly the size of a basketball court, more than 100 
computer screens glow in 911 and radio-dispatch consoles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mostly Civilian Operators 
</P>
<P>
The operators at the 15 consoles where calls come in are mostly civilians. A 
few exceptions are police officers who ask for experience handling 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
The civilians must complete a seven-month training and testing program before 
taking their first 911 call. The program teaches them how to deal with callers 
ranging from drunks to children, from those who are hysterical to those who are 
injured or unable to explain their emergency. 
</P>
<P>
During training, the operators spend several hours handling simulated emergency 
calls before they can take real 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
An actual call that reports what sounds like a life-threatening situation is 
termed a "hot shot." The operator immediately dispatches the information to 
patrol cars. The 911 computer automatically tells the operator the caller's 
location and the nearest patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of calls are not emergencies. Those are transferred to radio 
dispatchers at 45 other consoles. The calls then are assigned to patrol cars 
according to availability and priority. Calls for fire or medical services are 
immediately transferred to the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Staffing of the city's 911 consoles varies from shift to shift, police said. On 
weekend nights, all 15 consoles are staffed. During daylight hours, fewer 
operators are needed. Sometimes only half of the consoles are staffed. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the city's quiet 911 center, the Sheriff's Department's 911 
facilities seem less rigid or confined. 
</P>
<P>
At the Valencia station, two 911 consoles are in a 5-by-10-foot glass booth 
behind the front desk. Emergency calls are sometimes answered at the front desk 
or in the station sergeant's office. 
</P>
<P>
When a call comes in, information taken by a deputy is put on a computer screen 
and sent to the sheriff's communications center in East Los Angeles to be 
dispatched. The 911 deputy also tells the dispatchers the nearest patrol car to 
the caller. 
</P>
<P>
Police and sheriff's officials said the dispatching of calls takes only seconds 
in either system. But sheriff's officials believe their decentralized method 
has an added advantage because calls are answered by law officers with 
firsthand knowledge of emergency situations and the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us more of a customized service," Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-the-Job Training 
</P>
<P>
Deputies assigned to 911 receive some instruction from manuals but mostly 
receive on-the-job training from a senior operator, or watch deputy, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
California, which pays for the state's 911 systems, has no training 
requirements for operators. 
</P>
<P>
"There are generic minimum standards" for the operation of the equipment, said 
Leah Senitte, 911 program manager for the state General Services 
Administration. "But everything that happens after a call is answered is the 
local agency's responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said that each station fills its 911 positions with 
carefully chosen personnel, not with troublesome or patrol-weary deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never put somebody who we believe is not adequate on 911," Spierer 
said. "If we have a deputy who says he is tired of the street, he can volunteer 
but his qualifications for handling emergency situations are the primary 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keys to Advancement 
</P>
<P>
Spierer said the 911 posts are seen as keys toward advancement in the 
department. The senior position within the system -- watch deputy -- is the 
highest-paying deputy classification. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, Deputy Jim Greene, a 25-year veteran who had worked in the Santa 
Clarita Valley for 19 years -- four of them answering 911 calls -- was the 
watch deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Greene picked up the call from a pay phone on San Fernando Road in Newhall. The 
caller, Jim Finnila, reported that a teen-ager had been shot and lay bleeding a 
few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Until then the sheriff's system had operated smoothly. An emergency call had 
been answered by a seasoned deputy familiar with the area from which it came. 
</P>
<P>
But then something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Get the cops here quick!" Finnila said after indicating that he too was in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later Greene made a judgment call that 911 operators say should 
never be made. Sheriff's officials said he apparently decided that Finnila's 
call was not a legitimate emergency and disconnected the call. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recognized Address 
</P>
<P>
In this case, one of the positive aspects of the sheriff's 911 system may have 
worked against it. According to Sheriff Sherman Block, Greene apparently 
believed that the address flashed on the computer was that of a neighborhood 
bar, perhaps leading the deputy to dismiss the call. 
</P>
<P>
Greene apparently realized his mistake a few seconds later when a deputy on the 
other 911 console informed him about a shooting report at that location. The 
call had come 30 seconds ahead of Finnila's, but Greene hadn't known about it. 
</P>
<P>
When a caller provides incomplete information or cannot be understood, the 
Sheriff's Department and Los Angeles Police Department require that a patrol 
car be automatically dispatched on an "unknown trouble" call to the address. 
</P>
<P>
The 911 operator then must extract more information from the caller and pass it 
along to the officer. Even if the operator believes the call might be a prank, 
a patrol car must be dispatched, albeit with a warning that it is suspicious, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take a person literally," said Police Lt. David Musil, a 
communications center supervisor. "We have to respond." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department's Spierer agrees that it is better to be safe than 
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Judgment' 
</P>
<P>
"When there is something that doesn't sound right . . . that is a very 
difficult judgment to make," Spierer said. "In 99.9% of the cases, we are going 
to take a chance" and dispatch a car. 
</P>
<P>
There is little question that Greene's handling of Finnila's call reflected bad 
judgment, Block said. Greene, who no longer answers 911 calls, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities do not tabulate false 911 calls, but city and county 911 
supervisors said many calls are not legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"911 is really abused," Musil said. "We have people who call up just to ask 
what time it is. It is frequent that someone will report something very heinous 
and it is not true. They just want to see the lights and sirens." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department last month released an audit of a three-day period 
showing that only 1,430 -- or 28% -- of the 5,077 calls were actual 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Medical or fire emergencies, which were immediately transfered to the county 
Fire Department, accounted for 15% of the calls. Non-emergencies and referrals 
to other agencies made up 31%. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 911 calls -- 1,248, or about 25% -- were listed as prank calls, 
including false crime reports, the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,500 Calls Daily 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said they receive about 5,500 calls daily on the 911 system. 
Prank calls are not tabulated, officials said. But 70% to 75% of the calls are 
non-emergencies, Musil said. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens frequently complain when their non-life-threatening calls cannot be 
handled as emergencies and are instead dispatched according to priority. But 
mistakes in which emergency calls are erroneously believed to be phony are 
rare, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Senitte, the state program manager, said 911 systems in California handle 30 
million calls a year and only a handful of valid emergency calls go unheeded. 
"It happens only in very rare situations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years there were only two justified complaints that Los Angeles 
police operators mishandled 911 calls, believing they were not actual 
emergencies, Musil said. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the operator was faulted for not getting enough information from 
the caller to realize that the situation was life-threatening. He said he knows 
of no case where an operator hung up on a caller reporting an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. David Gomez of the Sheriff's Department said there were two complaints in 
1988 about the handling of 911 by sheriff's deputies. But he declined to 
elaborate on the circumstances.

SLOW-GROWTH PLAN'S FOES MISS A CHANCE TO COUNTERATTACK 
</P>

<P>
One of the hottest issues in Burbank has drawn a blank. 
</P>
<P>
When a proposed ordinance to limit construction of apartment buildings and 
other large residential developments appears on the sample ballot for the Feb. 
28 Burbank election, residents will see an argument from the law's author, 
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, urging them to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
If they look for a rebuttal on the next page, they will see nothing but white 
space. Opponents of the ordinance did not file an argument against it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why there's no opposing argument on the ballot, but I'm glad 
there isn't," Howard said. "I'm sure there will be some response to it at the 
appropriate time. But I think this ordinance is fair. Everyone has to realize 
there has to be some controls." 
</P>
<P>
Howard has often contended that Burbank's single-family home neighborhoods are 
increasingly being invaded by apartment complexes. In addition, the city's 
undeveloped hillsides are being eyed by hungry developers who want to build 
large housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would limit zoning changes in residential neighborhoods and force 
developers to meet stricter environmental and design standards. 
</P>
<P>
But just because its opponents didn't put their words in black and white 
doesn't mean that they intend to be silent. Several developers and real estate 
agents said they plan to launch a campaign to warn voters about the negative 
aspects of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bad, bad law," said Thomas Tunnicliffe, one of Burbank's more 
prominent developers. "This ordinance has unintended consequences that would 
take away the property rights of everyone in the city. It would give the 
outside world, which already has enough bad thoughts about Burbank, more 
ammunition." 
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition is anything but well-organized. The Burbank Board of 
Realtors did not issue a formal statement against the ordinance until Friday 
afternoon. The group's president, Mario Iacobellis, said the board had not been 
aware of the Dec. 22 deadline to place a rebuttal on the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"But we plan to fight this any way we can," Iacobellis said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael R. Hastings is not fighting the ordinance, but he is 
not wildly enthusiastic about backing Howard. Hastings complained that her 
ordinance has "no teeth" and would be ineffective. He said it could also be 
changed by a majority vote of the council. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he supports it because he believes that some kind of development 
control is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings' less-than-wholehearted support stems in part from the council's 
refusal last year to place his own slow-growth ordinance on the ballot. The two 
ordinances were similar, but Hastings' measure, unlike Howard's, placed a limit 
on residential development. 
</P>
<P>
The council last year approved a number of large developments in and around 
neighborhoods of single-family homes. The projects included a controversial 
129-home tract on hillside land. Council members also voted to increase density 
guidelines on some properties to accommodate the developments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Rate Up 
</P>
<P>
An average of 186 residential units -- apartments, condominiums and 
single-family homes -- were built annually in Burbank from 1974 to 1985. But 
the rate rose dramatically in 1986, when 1,819 residential units were 
constructed. In 1987, 1,117 units were built, and planning officials estimated 
that at least 1,000 units were built in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Rick Pruetuz said the city expects an average of 350 units a year 
to be built over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under Howard's measure, which would become effective immediately, the council 
would not be permitted to increase density standards, as they did last year, 
before 1993. Any changes would have to be approved by the council and voters, 
and further amendments to the city's general plan, which puts limits on growth, 
would not be allowed until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also establish environmental and landscaping standards for 
apartments or multifamily residences. Pruetuz said a consultant is preparing a 
study, which will take at least three months to complete, to determine what the 
standards should be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditional-Use Permits 
</P>
<P>
Until criteria are determined and adopted by the council, all residential 
projects intended to house more than one family would have to come before the 
city's planning board, and the developer would have to secure a conditional-use 
permit before building. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the ordinance would increase the opportunity for public comment on 
development and ensure that such public services as police, fire or utilities 
would not be strained by sudden growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens will no longer stand by and watch our beautiful neighborhoods 
slowly deteriorate through the stranglehold of traffic congestion, smog, 
brownouts, visual blight and the loss of municipal services," Howard wrote in 
her ballot argument. "Let's put the citizens of Burbank back into the driver's 
seat!" 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Hastings were the only council members to support a proposed 
citywide building moratorium in 1985. Howard said she has always wanted to take 
the issue straight to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developers' Opposition 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is being opposed by several developers and the Board of Realtors. 
They said it is not needed because the building of multifamily units has 
already slowed. 
</P>
<P>
They added that the City Council last year adopted three measures that 
addressed residents' concerns about development: limiting the height of 
industrial and commercial buildings near residential neighborhoods, increasing 
parking requirements on apartment and office buildings, and creating buffer 
zones between single-family neighborhoods and neighborhoods with higher 
density. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance is like kicking a dead dog," said Michael Cusumano, vice 
president of Cusumano Development in Burbank, another of the city's largest 
residential and commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
"At what point do you keep beating our heads against the wall?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Builders Affected 
</P>
<P>
The opponents said requiring developers to get conditional-use permits for all 
multifamily dwellings would hurt the small "mom-and-pop" builders. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone couldn't even build a duplex on their property without going before 
the city and the planning board, even if their property were zoned for that," 
Iacobellis said. "The large developers can handle going through the 
conditional-use process, but the smaller builders cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Iacobellis and other developers added that city codes regulating development 
should not be set in stone. He said the proposed ordinance would have prevented 
the rezoning last year of several acres in the Mariposa Triangle, a 
single-family neighborhood where residents are allowed to keep horses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1940s, part of the area had been zoned for light-industrial use to 
accommodate horse stables. But last year, residents protested when a developer 
tried take advantage of the zoning to build a public storage building. 
</P>
<P>
Bending to the community's wishes, city officials worked out an exchange with 
the developer for other property in the city, and the area was more strictly 
zoned to fit with the surrounding single-family homes and stables. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Howard's proposed ordinance also claimed that it would prohibit 
the rehabilitation of blighted areas and prevent the reconstruction of existing 
buildings destroyed by fire, earthquakes or other causes.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 78-year-old Sun Valley man who had been missing since Friday was found Sunday 
night afterhe called a friend's home. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce William McEntire looked about "an inch from being homeless" when he was 
found at Tampa Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard, according to his son, Chuck 
McEntire. He had spent the last two days doing "a lot of driving and sitting in 
his car", said his daughter, Nancy McEntire. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce McEntire called a friend, Sherree Herts, after looking up her number in 
the phone book about 9 p. m. Herts kept him on the phone while Chuck McEntire

SHOTS FIRED INTO TOPLESS BAR WOUND PATRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A customer in a Kearney topless bar was wounded in the chest Saturday night 
when two irate customers, who were kicked out of the bar an hour earlier, 
allegedly fired shots through the entrance, police said. 
</P>
<P>
John Posk, 44, was in Dirty Dan's, in the 4000 block of Kearney Mesa Road, 
about midnight when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the two suspects returned after being thrown out of the bar 
and waited by the entrance. One pulled out a gun, fired five rounds into the 
bar, then both escaped in a yellow Toyota Corolla, police said. The management 
of Dirty Dan's would not comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Posk was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was in fair condition 
Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman said.

RILEY WINS AN ARGUMENT AND LAKERS WIN THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may seem like quibbling now, what with the Lakers' latest blowout victory, a 
134-116 drubbing of the New Jersey Nets Sunday night at the Forum, safely 
secured and probably quickly forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
But at the time, with the Lakers needing every point they could acquire to 
repel the surprisingly competitive Nets, there was considerable haggling over 
an obscure NBA rule involving free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the deal: Midway through the second quarter, Net guard John Bagley was 
fouled on a drive, spraining his left ankle in the process. Bagley was forced 
to leave the game, and the rules stipulate that opposing team select a 
designated free-throw shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he wanted to select little-used Charles Shackleford 
to shoot the free throws. But referee Ed Middleton told Riley he had to select 
a player already in the game, so former Laker Mike McGee was chosen. He made 
one-of-two shots. 
</P>
<P>
But, just before the start of the second half, it was announced to the crowd of 
17,505 that the score was not 61-60, Lakers. The referees thumbed through the 
rule book and determined that Riley indeed could have selected any Net player 
to shoot the free throws. 
</P>
<P>
So, McGee's free throws were nullified, and Riley chose to bring Shackleford to 
the line to shoot just before the start of the third quarter. Shackleford 
almost made the Lakers pay for the move. He made the first shot but missed the 
second, keeping the score 61-60, Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then, I remembered something I read in the rule book 20 years 
ago," Riley said. "That's why I selected a guy off the bench. I wanted 
Shackleford in there. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, to compound the problem, Eddie told me after the half that I was 
right. I said, 'Just let it go.' He said that he couldn't because the Nets 
could have protested the game. It was just one of those bizarre turn of 
events." 
</P>
<P>
That's about the way things went for the struggling Nets on this night. Playing 
beyond probably even their own expectations, the Nets pushed the Lakers as best 
they could for three quarters, before careening back to reality in the fourth 
quarter that quickly became a Laker blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by only one point entering the fourth quarter, the Lakers put together 
a 15-4 run in the first 6 1/2 minutes to put away the Nets. New Jersey, which 
had shot better than 60% until then, made only one field goal in the first nine 
minutes of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But, for three quarters, the Nets could have been mistaken for that team on the 
other side of the Hudson River -- the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, who beat the Lakers in overtime at New Jersey in December shot 60.4% 
in the first half, out-rebounded the Lakers through three quarters and 
generally made the Lakers work hard for this one. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie forward Chris Morris scored 21 of his 27 points and guard Dennis Hopson 
19 of his 21 through three quarters, each hurting the Lakers from both the 
perimeter and underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the fourth quarter, and a reality check for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey's shooting went into a deep freeze, and the Lakers (32-14) seized 
upon the missed shots to jump-start a sputtering fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, another Laker blowout, running their home record to 20-1 and keeping 
them three games in front of the Seattle SuperSonics in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
The box score will show the usual Laker performances. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had 27 points and 13 assists, James Worthy 22 points and Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar adding 18 points and, somewhat surprisingly, nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's first basket enabled him to surpass the 38,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers also received 20 points from former Net Orlando Woolridge and 17 
from reserve swingman Tony Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
But what is not immediately apparent is that the Lakers needed all of those 
productive performances to overcome the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
"They really played well," said Johnson on the Nets, whose record fell to 
17-28. "They didn't play like their record. They shot the ball extremely well. 
</P>
<P>
"And, the thing is, they really made some tough shots. What happened was, a lot 
of times we had good defense, but (Morris and Hopson) shot over us and made it, 
anyway. But we knew that, eventually, they just can't keep doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riley: "It was contagious, the more outside shots they hit. Hopson was 
hitting running one-handers, (Lester) Conner (16 points) was dropping in 
three-pointers." 
</P>
<P>
But when the Nets finally could not find the net, it was a severe drought. And 
the Lakers, despite being pressed hard through three quarters, still had enough 
left in reverse to pounce on the opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets made only seven of 23 shots in the fourth quarter -- many coming in 
the ragged latter stages -- while the Lakers made 11 of 18 in that span. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to pick up the 'D'," Johnson said. "I think our defense caused a lot of 
those misses, and they had a lot of long rebounds that (enabled) us to get 
running." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the way the team played tonight," said Morris, held to four 
points in the fourth quarter. "The Lakers are a great team over four quarters. 
We made some big mistakes in the final quarter and, as usual, Magic made the 
key plays." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson was not the only Laker to excel when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lakers fell behind by seven points early in the third quarter, Worthy 
went to work. He 11 of his 12 points that quarter after the Nets had taken that 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell scored 11 points in the fourth quarter, when the Lakers broke open the 
game. Perhaps the key basket during the Lakers' 15-4 run came with 8:41 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson missed a three-point attempt, but Campbell rebounded the ball 
underneath the basket, flipped in a one-handed shot and was fouled on the play. 
His subsequent free throw gave the Lakers a 108-98 lead, and the Nets were not 
heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker guard Byron Scott attended his first Laker game, in street clothes, since 
being sidelined with urinary bleeding 12 days ago. Scott is scheduled to 
practice with the team today and Tuesday in hopes of being cleared to play in 
Wednesday night's game against the Golden State Warriors. The Lakers, however, 
might choose to hold Scott out of Wednesday night's game, the last before the 
All-Star break. That would give him six additional days of rest. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he feels fine and that symptoms have not returned after working out 
on his own the past week. Scott said the illness has been tough on him, 
physically and emotionally. "It wasn't just something I was dealing with for 
two or three days," Scott said. "It was more than a week of not feeling well 
and having blood coming out. That was the scary part, seeing that and then not 
knowing what was causing it. Emotionally, it was tough to handle, but I also 
felt bad. But I thought I said something early enough to catch it. The first 
time I really noticed the blood, I told my doctor. If I had let it go longer, 
it would've been a lot more serious, really bad."

BRUINS RUN MILLER OUT OF PAULEY; 
</P>
<P>
SHOWING NO MERCY, UCLA OVERWHELMS HIS BEAVERS, 92-75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA used the occasion of Ralph Miller's final visit to Pauley Pavilion Sunday 
to present the veteran Oregon State basketball coach with a crystal clock and a 
piece of vasa sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Miller, who will retire at the end of the season, undoubtedly 
would have preferred a more sentimental parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
A victory, for instance, would have been the 667th of his career, enabling 
Miller to join John Wooden in sixth place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, though, took home only the hardware. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA buried the cold-shooting Beavers, 92-75, giving Coach Jim Harrick his 
first career victory over Miller and enabling the Bruins to maintain a 
realistic chance of winning the Pacific 10 Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' fourth straight victory improved their record to 14-5 overall and 
9-2 in the Pac-10, leaving them within striking distance of Arizona, which is 
11-1 in the conference after beating Washington, 85-68, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will play Arizona twice in its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
An Oregon State victory would have moved the Beavers (14-5, 7-4) into a 
three-way tie for second place with UCLA and Stanford and all but assured 
Arizona of winning its second straight conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the Beavers, who beat UCLA, 82-69, last month and had lost just once in 11 
games since Dec. 23, shot only 40.3% and were outrebounded, 44-32. 
</P>
<P>
In last month's game at Corvallis, Ore., Oregon State shot 62.7%, easily the 
best by a UCLA opponent this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We got whipped good," Miller said. "We could not handle their offense and we 
didn't run our own offense very well. 
</P>
<P>
"They got their running game started. And when you (allow) that, you're always 
in trouble against UCLA. So, we certainly didn't come close to playing as well 
as we can. UCLA played very well and deserved the victory. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins did most of their damage under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to try to make them stop us inside because, from what I've seen, 
that's a tough thing for them to do," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, it was close to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's starting forwards, Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean, each scored 26 points. 
Wilson made 10 of 16 shots and pulled down a game-high 14 rebounds and MacLean 
made 12 of 20 shots to overtake Rod Foster as UCLA's all-time leading freshman 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Pooh Richardson added 18 points and nine assists for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-0 run by UCLA early in the second half included five points by 
Richardson, four by MacLean and a dunk by Wilson, giving the Bruins a 54-38 
lead. UCLA later stretched its advantage to 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson scored five points and MacLean scored four in an 11-0 run early in 
the second half that was capped by Wilson's dunk and gave the Bruins a 54-38 
lead. UCLA eventually stretched its lead to 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the outside shooting of Gary Payton, who made six of nine 3-point 
shots and scored 23 points, could keep Oregon State close. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty excited beforehand," Wilson said. "We thought that if we played 
up to our ability we would have a pretty good time of it." 
</P>
<P>
Led by the enthusiastic Wilson, the Bruins played well enough to saddle Miller 
with his 20th career loss at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
A major college coach for more than 37 seasons at Wichita State, Iowa and 
Oregon State, Miller won only four times in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really aggressive," said MacLean, who also had eight rebounds, "and 
that translated into easy baskets." 
</P>
<P>
The day started on a cheerier note for Miller, who was given a standing ovation 
from the crowd of 8,636 as he and his wife, Jean, received their gifts just 
before tipoff from Harrick and his wife, Sally. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, ran out to a 37-32 halftime lead despite making only three of 10 
free throws in the last 12 minutes of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Bruins' shooting improved markedly in the second half, when they made 
22 of 33 shots, including eight of 11 by MacLean and six of seven by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be playing this way at this time of the year," said Harrick, whose 
team will meet Arizona Feb. 16 at Tucson and March 4 in Pauley Pavilion. "I 
thought we played with great emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Also, they took care of the ball, making only eight turnovers, the least 
they've made since Dec. 7, when they made seven against Boston University, and 
12 less than they made last month against the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key because last time we killed ourselves against their press," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
This time, all they killed was Miller's bon voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended a five-game winning streak for Oregon State, which had also won 
three straight against UCLA. . . . Jim Harrick's career record against Ralph 
Miller is 1-4, including an 0-3 record when Harrick coached at Pepperdine. . . 
. UCLA assistant coach Paul Landreaux stayed home with the flu. . . . Can UCLA 
beat Arizona? "I think, of all the teams in the conference, UCLA has the talent 
to do it," said Oregon State's Eric Knox, who scored 21 points Sunday. "They're 
a lot better than they were a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean has 379 points in 19 games, a 19.9 average. Rod Foster scored 368 
points in 32 games in the 1979-80 season, averaging 11.5 points. "When he gets 
the ball one-on-one around the basket, he's very hard to defend," Harrick said 
of MacLean. "I don't know a lot of guys who can stop him down there." . . . 
UCLA's Kevin Walker had a career-high six assists, bringing his season total to 
39. In his first two seasons at UCLA, Walker had only 16 assists in 56 games. . 
. . UCLA will play USC Wednesday night at Pauley Pavilion.

JIM MURRAY: THE LOS ANGELES OPEN;

<P>
WHEN THIS GUY GETS A LITTLE MAD, HE GETS A LOT BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
We never know what's good for us. Remember how your grandmother used to tell 
you that to get you to eat your broccoli? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the worst thing that can happen to you is to get what you think you 
want most in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Take Mark Calcavecchia, the golfer. On Sunday afternoon in the brisk raw 
setting of Riviera Country Club's 12th hole, Calcavecchia was standing in the 
middle of the fairway with a little seven-iron to the green. He was one-shot 
behind the dour Scotsman, Sandy Lyle, with eight holes to play in the L.A. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
All Calcavecchia wanted in the world was to nip that little shot up there on 
the green somewhere adjacent to the hole where he could putt for a birdie and 
tie the match. Lyle had already jerked his shot into the left rough. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia got a break. Only he didn't think so. The shot came off just as he 
had pictured it. It landed perfectly on the green right where he was aiming. 
"It was just a perfect shot," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
And, then, it took this unaccountable one hop over the green and into the rough 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia was beside himself with rage. He slammed his club in the 
ground, cursed, kicked at it -- and strode off with teeth gnashed and fists 
clenched. 
</P>
<P>
He had just won the golf tournament is all. Because, Mark Calcavecchia was to 
go up to the green and take his most trusty club -- a weapon he calls his 
"L-wedge," and squirt a chip shot right in the hole for a three. Lyle was to 
miss his birdie shot and, in fact, was to miss a par shot two holes later. He 
was to lose the tournament by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
If Calcavecchia had brought off his approach shot the way he devoutly wished, 
the match might have gone on into the gloaming. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time in the round that Calcavecchia wanted to go bury a 
club in the ground. At the 10th hole, he similarly stood over a near-perfect 
drive. He took his wedge and, in his own words, "hit it fat." The resulting 
terrible shot put him at such a disadvantageous position near the green, he was 
in danger of needing three putts. He only needed one. Another birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Golf is that kind of a game. Life may be unfair but golf is downright satanic. 
It's the real evil empire. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia is the L.A. Open champion today -- joining such illustrious 
ancestors as Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Gene Littler -- 
because of two shots which, if someone had said after he hit them, "Oh, here's 
a ball, hit another one!" he would have done and yelled "Pick that one up I 
just hit over the green, will you? I'll play this one." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he had to go play two balls which turned out to be in perfect 
birdie position. 
</P>
<P>
He had to play 27 holes to win the L.A. Open Sunday. And 23 of them were pars 
and four of them birdies. Three of the birdies were chip-ins after approach 
shots that had Calcavecchia railing at the gods. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the matter are that Mark Calcavecchia is playing about as good 
golf as anyone on the American tour at the moment. He plays it at one speed -- 
wide open. If he were a pitcher he'd be a fireballer. If he were a race driver, 
he'd floor it. In basketball, he'd go for three-pointers. In fact, driving to 
the course Saturday, he got a traffic ticket. He wasn't speeding, he explained, 
just driving too fast. Mark even wants to birdie Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks every shot should be a birdie, every putt a drop. Every drive should 
split the fairway, every pitch should hit the flag. He takes it personally when 
a shot doesn't come off the way he thinks it should. He takes it out on the 
club, the ball, the bag, whatever is nearest. He threw such a tantrum at the 
AT&amp;T last week that he later apologized to his playing partner, Gary 
Carter, and anyone else within earshot. 
</P>
<P>
He's not as tempestuous as, say, Tommy Bolt. Tommy was sure golf was out to get 
him. The guy Mark Calcavecchia fears (rightly) is Mark Calcavecchia. "Whenever 
I start making a jerk out of myself, start acting like a crybaby, I rely on my 
wife to straighten me out. She comes and says, 'Hey, you jerk, you're making a 
jerk out of yourself. You're lucky to be out here, you're lucky there's a game 
like golf for you to play. Stop embarrassing me -- and yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Impatient, bad-tempered, suspicious, Mark is not apt to put anybody in mind of 
St. Francis of Assisi just yet, but he did note that, as angry as he got at the 
shots that won him the tournament, two years ago it would have been worse. "It 
used to take me three to four holes to get over it. I would pout, fume. It's 
all right to get mad if you just go on to the next shot and put it behind you." 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Sandy Lyle, probably just got a lousy break. He didn't have any 
shots to get mad at, any perfect swings that just took bad hops. Of course, the 
trouble with Sandy Lyle is, you cannot tell by looking at him whether he liked 
the shot or not. In fact, you cannot tell by looking at him whether he just won 
a million bucks or just heard he had a year to live. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be a cliche to say of Tommy Bolt, "No telling how much he would have 
won if he had not gotten so angry on the golf course." Now that Mark 
Calcavecchia has won two tournaments and $358,952 already this year, look for 
the golf books to put rage right alongside keep-your-left-arm-straight as an 
adjunct to good shooting. Except that Mark Calcavecchia may be the only guy on 
tour to go into a tantrum over a shot that has just put him up there in birdie 
range and won him an L.A. Open.

MORRISON, 52, DIES OF HEART ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH CAROLINA COACH, EX-GIANT STAR COLLAPSES AFTER RACQUETBALL GAME

<P>
Joe Morrison, head football coach at South Carolina and a star for the New York 
Giants during the 1960s, died Sunday night of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, 52, had been playing racquetball at the university and was found 
collapsed in the shower, Providence Hospital spokeswoman Dawn Catalano said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not feeling well, apparently went to the shower and was found in the 
shower collapsed when they started CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on him," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Morrison was alive, but unconscious, when he was brought to the 
hospital at 8:44 p.m. EST. He was pronounced dead at 9:03 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Diggs, South Carolina's running back coach, saw Morrison just hours 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed fine," Diggs said. "He was upbeat, spirited and so forth. 
Racquetball is one of his biggest pastimes when he has the chance to get some 
exercise. It just came as a big 7shock to everyone. It never even crossed my 
mind that anything like this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Catalano said Morrison, who played for the Giants from 1959 to 1972 as a 
running back and tight end, had a history of heart problems and previously was 
hospitalized for that condition. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison previously coached at Tennessee Chattanooga and New Mexico. His career 
record was 101-72-7 over 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He was 39-28-2 in six seasons at South Carolina, including 8-4 in 1988, when he 
took the Gamecocks to the the Liberty Bowl, where they lost to Indiana 34-10. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison was the 1984 Walter Camp national coach of the year after South 
Carolina went 10-2, losing to Oklahoma State, 21-14, in the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
He was born on Aug. 21, 1937, and grew up in Lima, Ohio. At Cincinnati, he set 
school records in scoring, passing and rushing and twice was named to the All 
Missouri Valley Conference team.

CHANG, AGASSI WRAP UP U.S. SWEEP OF PARAGUAY IN DAVIS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the U.S. Davis Cup team, aside from Michael Chang and Andre Agassi, Sunday 
was just a day of fun in the sun before a supportive capacity crowd of 5,500 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans had clinched this first-round world group matchup Saturday, when 
Ken Flach and Robert Seguso won the doubles for the third point of the 
best-of-five encounter against Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
And much of the talk around the host Sonesta Sanibel Harbour Resort was about 
what was ahead for this team, namely its April 7-9 quarterfinal against France 
in the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The only real business of the day was to entertain the fans, and that wasn't 
all that crucial because they did a good job of entertaining themselves by 
basking in the hot Florida sunshine and holding up signs for television cameras 
that said: "+80 Wind-Chill Factor." Certainly those parts of the country 
suffering through freezing temperatures were less than amused. 
</P>
<P>
The matches played and won by Chang and Agassi, the American teen-agers who had 
gotten their team off to a 2-0 start Friday in a fairly pressure-packed 
situation, were a nice sideshow to the fun in the sun. Even though how they did 
wouldn't affect the team, it mattered to Chang, 16, and Agassi, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Chang beat the fabled Hugo Chapacu, who somehow won the first set, 7-5, and 
then played as if he planned to live forever off his heroic victory over Jimmy 
Arias in 1987. Chapacu lost the next sets, 6-0, 6-1, in the shortened 
best-of-three-set match, appearing so excited about the whole thing that he 
even bothered to chase down five or six of Chang's shots during the last 13 
games. The only surprise when it was over was that Chapacu's shirt was wet. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi won, 6-2, 6-4, over Francisco Gonzalez, who replaced the injured and 
out-of-shape Victor Pecci for the singles finale. Unlike Chapacu, Gonzalez 
tried hard. Like Chapacu, it probably didn't matter anyway. 
</P>
<P>
After their victories completed the 5-0 sweep, Chang and Agassi explained why 
this all really had mattered. Chang's reason was fairly logical. Agassi's was, 
well, vintage Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said: "I felt pressure to win today. Here's a guy, ranked way below me 
(No. 490 to Chang's No. 30) and if I can't beat him, well, it says something 
about my game. It wasn't pressure like I felt before I played Pecci Friday, 
when I didn't really sleep all night. The thing is, I don't really look at 
myself as a 16 year old. I go out in every match to win, and I expect to keep 
improving." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said his motivation was that the opponent was Paraguay. He had seen on 
television and had been told the things that had been done to the U.S. team in 
'87 in that South American country -- the rock-throwing and drum-beating and 
questionable line-calling that took place in Paraguay's 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
And Agassi said his motivation became even more intense when he was told that 
Gonzalez, not Pecci, was his opponent, since Gonzalez was the Paraguayan player 
who told the press here earlier this week that he thought the U.S. team was a 
"bunch of crybabies." 
</P>
<P>
So Agassi met the press after his match, wearing a T-shirt that said: "Who's 
Crying Now, Paraguay?" 
</P>
<P>
"I can never imagine myself being that determined in a Davis Cup match in which 
we were up, 4-0," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say that what happened here, with us winning like we did, was a 
gesture to Paraguay. Hopefully, in the future, they can be more civilized. 
Anybody who couldn't admit that they were uncivilized (in '87 in Paraguay) is 
asinine. 
</P>
<P>
"So I wanted this match bad. It mattered. A lot. The issue of the Gonzalez 
crybaby quote before the match was a big one with me. From what he said, and 
from what I have heard from others on the tour about him, if I based my opinion 
on him from that, then he would not be the kind of person I care to know well." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said this was just a Paraguay thing, not a policy statement on the state 
of Davis Cup nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect crowds in San Diego to be anything other than supportive. 
Nothing more," he said. "We play France there, good players, nice people. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different here," he said. "It made me want to fight hard to win all the 
time. You had six Paraguayan fans trying to stir up things, take on a whole 
American crowd. So I just gave it back to them a little." 
</P>
<P>
A little? 
</P>
<P>
When he broke Gonzalez's serve to go up, 5-4, in the second set, he headed for 
the sidelines for the break, then stopped, faced the small Paraguayan cheering 
section, stuck his thumbs in his ears, waved his hands and stuck out his 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
To visualize it, think of what a 5 year old does when he's told to eat his 
spinach. In fact, for a general impression of many of Agassi's court antics, 
just think of a 5 year old. 
</P>
<P>
When Agassi put the victory away with a huge topspin forehand passing shot, he 
stood in the middle of the court, looking like Rocky on the top of the stairs, 
and celebrated with the crowd. Then he trotted across to the far side and 
tossed his sweaty headband into the crowd, drawing a crescendo of young female 
screeching. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it was one of those great moments in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Right here in Ft. Myers, Fla., in the closing moments of a Davis Cup match 
against a country outnumbered on site by 5,500 to six and a country that just 
lost its president in a bloody military coup, an 18 year old from Las Vegas was 
conducting international sports policy-making, supported feverishly by his 
groupies. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kissinger would have gotten sick on his wing-tips.

All right Michael Chang, youngest U.S. Davis Cup player of the modern era, how 
do you feel about good old Placentia, Calif., your hometown, the city that has 
given the sports world Olympic swimmer Janet Evans from El Dorado High School 
and you, now the world's 30th-ranked tennis player at age 16, from Valencia 
High? 
</P>
<P>
Chang, after his Davis Cup match, said Sunday: "Well, it's kind of like, in 
Placentia, they've got this big sign when you drive into town and it says: 
'PLACENTIA, HOME OF JANET EVANS.' Then, down here, there's this sign that says: 
'Also Home of Michael Chang.' " BILL DWYRE

<P>
There were a few tense moments Sunday as the Nevada Las Vegas basketball team 
flew home after its 99-98 Big West Conference loss at UC Irvine Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The team's America West Flight 573 lost cabin pressure midway through the 
flight followed by severe, but brief, vibrations and a loss of altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers complained of a shortness of breath, severe ear pressure and 
hearing problems. But others didn't notice anything. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels Coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose team hopes to break a two-game losing 
streak tonight against UC Santa Barbara, said: "I've got so many things to 
worry about, I didn't even know anything was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said the cabin pressure loss was caused by a circuit break, 
which was repaired in flight.

SCOTT OSTLER: RARE PAIR STEPS FORWARD FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Half of UCLA's front court is built like a rock and has the touch of a 
blacksmith. 
</P>
<P>
The other half is built like a bread stick and has the touch of a diamond 
cutter. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean can do pretty much anything you 
might want your front court to do. 
</P>
<P>
Score? Sunday, in an important Pacific 10 game against Oregon State at Pauley 
Pavilion, they each had 26. 
</P>
<P>
Rebound? Wilson grabbed 14 Sunday, MacLean 8. 
</P>
<P>
Run? Wilson is a very quick 6-foot-8, MacLean a real smooth 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
Play defense? When they put their minds to it. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, they're in sync, as dissimilar yet as well matched as Hap-pea and 
Pea-wee, those pea-soup making twins. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Wilson and Maclean have worn one another out on the basketball 
court for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"First time I saw Don was when he was in the sixth grade and I was in the 
eighth grade," says Wilson, who is now a junior. 
</P>
<P>
They were playing on opposing teams in the American Roundball Corporation, a 
youth league in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
They were both big, both very good, and within a couple of years they became 
regular workout partners, even though Wilson lived in Sherman Oaks and MacLean 
in the Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
When MacLean was going into the ninth grade and was deciding to get serious 
about basketball, he and Wilson worked out one-on-one, or two-on-two, every 
weekend, workouts that continued for two years, then resumed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He prepared me for high school," MacLean said. "He prepared me for this 
season, too." 
</P>
<P>
What more can you ask out of your power forward? Wilson not only rebounds 
better than anyone in the conference, but he also has helped groom one of the 
nation's two or three finest freshman basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean might not even be a Bruin if it weren't for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him (during recruiting) about the possibility of us playing beside 
each other," Wilson says. "We complement each other, we know where the other 
one will be. But there were a lot of things going on at UCLA (Walt Hazzard 
fired and Jim Harrick hired), so I couldn't tell him to come into a program 
where I wasn't sure about the coaching situation." 
</P>
<P>
Was Wilson's presence a factor in MacLean's decision to become a Bruin? 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the advantages," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, MacLean coming to UCLA was a disadvantage to Wilson. His buddy, the 
freshman, has overshadowed Trevor somewhat. MacLean is the phenom, the gifted 
scorer with the beautiful touch. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson doesn't seem to mind sharing the spotlight. He and MacLean are 
roommates, and Wilson is MacLean's biggest booster. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor is proud of MacLean's un-timid style of play, proud that MacLean has 
developed somewhat of a reputation as a woofer, a smart-mouth freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"When they try to push him around or talk about him because he's a freshman, he 
comes right back at them," Wilson said. "He's gotten a lot better, he fights 
back now, he doesn't like to be pushed around." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Wilson, who despite the acclaim for MacLean and for senior guard 
Pooh Richardson, might be the key Bruin on a team that has an outside shot at 
the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The Pooh-led fast break most often starts with a Trevor Wilson rebound, and 
he's second on the team in scoring, 18.7 to MacLean's 19.6. 
</P>
<P>
"Trevor is just a great athlete," Jim Harrick said. "He has great quickness for 
a forward, and when he consistently hits his medium-range jump shot, he'll be 
ready (for the National Basketball Assn.)" 
</P>
<P>
Right now he's definitely ready for the Pac-10. His 26 points Sunday were a 
career high. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to pick up the intensity the last few games," Wilson said. "You have 
to go all out, make a consistent effort. When people are pushing you, you push 
back. It's hard to explain, but (Harrick) said I wasn't aggressive enough. I 
watch film all the time, and I agree with him." 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive Wilson is impressive. Sunday he scored seven of UCLA's first nine 
points, then tossed an assist to MacLean. Trevor threw down at least three 
dunks in the game, including one where he started to jam two-handed, changed 
his mind in midair and swooped in for a right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is one of those guys who can intimidate the other team just by strolling 
onto the court to jump center. He's a dedicated off-season weightlifter who 
looks as strong as he plays. 
</P>
<P>
He has helped push MacLean into weightlifting, although on MacLean the effects 
of the iron are less obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, they have impressive skills. Together, they can be unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA assembly line cranks out forwards one after another, fine-tuned and 
NBA-ready. Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Keith Wilkes, Dave Meyers, Marques 
Johnson, David Greenwood, Kiki Vandeweghe, people like that. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Wilson &amp; MacLean, playground buddies from way back, could wind 
up as good as any two the Bruins ever put on the floor.

HORTON LEADS IOWA OVER ILLINOIS, 86-82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all these years, Iowa's Ed Horton still gets a kick out of playing the 
Big Ten Conference team from his home state. 
</P>
<P>
Facing Illinois for the seventh time in his college career on Sunday, the 
6-feet-8 senior from Springfield, Ill., scored 26 points and grabbed 17 
rebounds to lead No. 9 Iowa to an 86-82 victory over the No. 2 Illini at Iowa 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those guys out there are my friends," Horton said of the Illinois 
players. "It gets me going." 
</P>
<P>
Horton, getting 20 or more points for the 10th time in the past 11 games, made 
10 of 17 shots, including two consecutive baskets midway through the second 
half after Illinois had pulled into a 57-57 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's B.J. Armstrong scored 24 points, and Roy Marble had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa also got a big lift from 6-10 forward Matt Bullard, who played for the 
first time since tearing ligaments in his left knee on Dec. 12. Bullard had 
eight points, including a pair of three-pointers, and six rebounds as the 
Hawkeyes, 17-4 overall, pulled into a second-place tie in the Big Ten with 
Illinois and Michigan at 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (18-3, 5-3) lost for the third time in four games since starting guard 
Kendall Gill was sidelined by a broken bone in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona 85, Washington 68 -- Anthony Cook scored 23 points and Sean Elliott had 
21 points as the No. 4 Wildcats finished with a flurry to beat the Huskies in a 
Pacific 10 game at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (17-1, 11-1) led just 72-66 with 1:14 left before going on a 13-2 burst 
to close the game. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge Recasner scored 18 points for the Huskies (9-11, 5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 69, Villanova 55 -- Jaren Jackson scored 27 points, but it was a 
stifling man-to-man defense that lifted the No. 6-ranked Hoyas (17-2, 7-1) over 
the Wildcats (12-10, 3-6) in a Big East game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown's 6-10 freshman who leads the nation in blocked 
shots with a 5.5 average, blocked eight. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova made only 23 of 69 from the field (33.3%). Georgetown shot 24 for 50 
(48%). 
</P>
<P>
Duke 102, Notre Dame 80 -- Danny Ferry scored 28 points, 11 during a key 
second-half surge, as the No. 12 Blue Devils routed the Irish at South Bend, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Duke led by four points before going on a 20-2 burst that made it 78-56. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils, who had lost four of their last five games, are now 15-4. 
Notre Dame is 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 60, Rutgers 58 -- The No. 18 Mountaineers held the Scarlets 
Knights scoreless for the final 4:22 to win an Atlantic 10 game at Piscataway, 
N.J., and extend their winning streak to 16, longest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers are now 17-2 and 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
Backup center Wade Smith scored what proved to be the winning basket, banking 
in a five-foot shot with 2:44 to play for the game's final points. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers (8-11, 6-4) had four chances to tie the game, but Tom Savage missed a 
three-point attempt, turned the ball over and then had a shot blocked with 1:05 
to play. Rutgers missed its final chance when Craig Carter's driving 10-foot 
bank shot bounced off the rim at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 84, Kentucky 72 -- Alec Kessler scored 22 points as the Bulldogs (13-8, 
5-6) beat the Wildcats in a Southeastern Conference game at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky, which could have gained a share of the SEC lead with No. 19 LSU, fell 
to 11-11 and 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mills led Kentucky with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Methodist 68, UNC Charlotte 66 -- Center Glenn Puddy hit two free 
throws with :01 left to give the Mustangs the nonconference win at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Puddy, who led SMU (9-10) with 20 points and 18 rebounds was fouled while 
attempting to rebound teammate Todd Alexander's jump shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Williams led the 49ers (12-8) with 17 points and Cedric Ball added 16.

A dispute between Jerry Reynolds, coach of the Sacramento Kings, and guard 
Derek Smith could come to a head today with the end of Smith's six-day 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sacramento Bee, negotiations to buy out Smith's contract have 
deadlocked, with Reynolds threatening to quit if Smith rejoins the team. Smith 
says he will report to practice unless he's waived. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's agent, Ron Grinker, said the 27-year-old guard, acquired by the Kings 
in a 1986 trade with the Clippers, intends to file a defamation suit against 
the Kings if the club refuses either to allow him back or waive him. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Lukenbill, the Kings' managing general partner, said the team will stand 
behind Reynolds and end its three-year association with Smith, who has been on 
reserve status since December. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds suspended Smith Jan. 30 after a disagreement during a team meeting.

TRIAL REVEALS THE TRAIL OF CLUES THAT LED POLICE TO NIGHT STALKER SUSPECT 
RAMIREZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When police investigators arrived at a double-murder scene on March 28, 1985, 
they found a distinctive shoe print in a flower bed outside the Whittier home. 
Within four months, they would encounter that same shoe print at five other 
residential robbery-murder scenes throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Those shoe prints would emerge as one of the first key clues that alerted 
police agencies to the likelihood that a serial killer was roaming the county, 
killing, raping, slashing and beating victims during nighttime burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
New details of how an areawide police task force pursued the trail of the 
sadistic killer, who became known as the Night Stalker, began to emerge last 
week with the opening of the prosecution case against Richard Ramirez, 28, now 
facing 13 murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the shoe prints, the Night Stalker task force quickly learned to 
recognize other signatures left by the killer. Among them were distinctive 
slash wounds in five of the murders, similar handcuffs used to restrain some of 
the victims -- and then left behind -- and "blunt force" head trauma to half a 
dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Method of Entry 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the killer apparently entered the homes through an unlocked 
window or door after removing a screen. In two incidents, the intruder 
apparently gained entry somehow through a pet door. In Monrovia, he painted two 
pentagrams -- an inverted star inside a circle -- on the thigh of one victim 
and on the bedroom wall of a second. 
</P>
<P>
And after Ramirez's Aug. 31, 1985, arrest, authorities say, his fingerprints 
were matched with those found at several of the crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But such clues pointing to one suspect were still in the future as homicide 
detectives arrived in Whittier that March morning nearly four years ago and 
noticed the shoe print. 
</P>
<P>
Police next encountered the shoe print in early May, outside a Monrovia home 
that had been ransacked. The elderly woman resident died a short time later of 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after that break-in, the same shoe print -- made by an Avia aerobics 
shoe -- turned up outside the bedroom window of a Monterey Park home. The man 
in the house had died from a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
From then through July 20, 1985, the shoe print appeared at murder scenes in 
Monrovia, Arcadia, Monterey Park and Sun Valley. By then, the Night Stalker 
task force -- one of the largest police mobilizations since the infamous 
Hillside Strangler case in the 1970s -- was in full gear. 
</P>
<P>
As the crimes continued, interviews with survivors and other evidence left the 
task force with little doubt that a brazen killer was on the loose. The same 
four handguns, for instance, were being used in many of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
By then, it had also become apparent that the killer typically struck homes in 
quiet, often remote residential neighborhoods close to the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block held a press conference on Aug. 8 
after an alleged Night Stalker attack in Diamond Bar in which a man was shot to 
death and his wife sexually assaulted. The sheriff's remarks touched off 
widespread fear throughout Southern California, prompting runs on gun shops and 
home-security stores. 
</P>
<P>
"As information began to develop from other police agencies, regarding the 
nature and the method of operation and so forth, it became apparent that at 
least some of these crimes may have been committed by the same individual," 
Block said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Encounters 
</P>
<P>
While the Night Stalker task force was already in high gear, Ramirez twice had 
close encounters with members of the LAPD who stopped him on traffic charges. 
Once Ramirez ran away, and the other time he was given a ticket for a minor 
traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez eventually was identified through a partial fingerprint on a stolen 
car, which was found abandoned. A witness had placed the car at the scene of an 
alleged Night Stalker attack in Orange County. Ramirez, a self-proclaimed devil 
worshiper from El Paso, Tex., had a criminal record, mostly involving drugs and 
vehicle violations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured by civilians after he tried to commandeer a getaway car in East 
Los Angeles, about 12 hours after his photograph was widely disseminated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identified by Survivors 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he was identified by many survivors of alleged Night Stalker attacks 
and was linked to many recovered items that had been taken from the crime 
scenes, such as TVs, stereos and jewelry that were confiscated from a relative 
and an acquaintance. Police also found a car in the El Sereno area linked to 
Ramirez that had a pentagram drawn on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
Retrospectively, homicide detectives also linked to Ramirez the murder in June, 
1984, of a 79-year-old Glassell Park woman. Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Phil Halpin said during his opening statement last week that two of 
Ramirez's fingerprints were found on the frame of a window screen that had been 
removed from the woman's ground-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, Ramirez faces 13 murder counts and 
30 other felony charges, including attempted murder, rape, sodomy and oral 
copulation. He faces a 14th murder charge in San Francisco and attempted murder 
and sexual assault charges in Orange County.

STATE PLAN ON NURSING HOME INSPECTIONS ANGERS CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Senior citizen activists, county health officials and prosecutors who handle 
nursing home abuse cases are reacting with dismay and anger at a proposal by 
the state to replace Los Angeles County's nursing home inspection program with 
an operation of its own. 
</P>
<P>
In Gov. George Deukmejian's budget, state health officials estimated that about 
$1 million a year could be saved by the state taking over inspections at the 
county's estimated 400 private nursing homes. State employees would take the 
place of county employees in paying periodic visits to the homes to monitor the 
quality of care and follow up on complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's decision has provoked widespread opposition in Los Angeles 
County, the only county in the state that employs its own nursing home 
inspection teams. The criticism has prompted state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles), chairman of the Senate's Health and Human Services Committee, to 
schedule a hearing on the issue later this month in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the state's decision threatens to break up a well-run system that 
has been in place since 1966. County officials said the aggressive prosecution 
of nursing home operators in violation of care standards could be jeopardized 
if county inspections are halted. 
</P>
<P>
"The county of Los Angeles does the best job in the whole state," said Adele 
Erenberg, head of the health task force for the seniors' activist group, Gray 
Panthers, in Southern California. "The state has not got a record to fall back 
on to show they can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Frauens, a Los Angeles deputy city attorney who is supervisor of the 
consumer protection section, said she was very distressed by the state's move. 
</P>
<P>
"The County of Los Angeles has been a model agency of how nursing home cases 
should be investigated," Frauens said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, however, said they suggested the takeover because the state is 
facing a budget crisis and must save money wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the very important things we want to get across, and we've made it 
clear to the Los Angeles County staff, is that it is not an action that is a 
statement of poor performance or anything like that. It is frankly a money 
issue," said Teresa Hawkes, deputy director for licensing and certification 
with the state's Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Los Angeles County is unique because it is the only local 
government in California that inspects nursing homes, hospitals and home 
health-care services through a contractual agreement with the state. Everywhere 
else, state personnel conduct the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have filed cases against more than 200 operators in the last 
decade, said Ralph Lopez, the county's associate deputy director of 
environmental management, who oversees the inspection section. Prosecutors said 
that working with county inspectors ensured a level of cooperation that does 
not always exist in other counties where the state conducts the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
State documents show that another consideration was that the nursing home 
industry is expected to support the change. 
</P>
<P>
A state memo that included reasons for the switch, stated: "Over the years, the 
nursing home industry and provider associations have been critical of the 
state's contract with Los Angeles County. Termination of the contract is 
therefore projected to be favorably received by the providers." 
</P>
<P>
"I find it slightly amusing, though it's no laughing matter, that one of the 
stated reasons" for the switch is that "the nursing home industry and providers 
have been critical of the state contract," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dave Helmsin, spokesman for the California Assn. of Health Facilities, 
which represents more than 900 operators, said the industry is neutral on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any particular problem with who does the inspections, as long as 
they are done in a credible fashion and done within state standards," Helmsin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials dispute the state claims of a $1-million savings with 
the state taking over nursing home inspections. They said the county will 
contest the state's figures at the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Cut Jobs 
</P>
<P>
One way the state proposes to economize is to eliminate some positions and to 
close two of the county's five regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkes said more detailed studies of potential savings will be calculated soon. 
If it appears the state will not save money after all, the plan will be 
dropped, she said. The state will also consider allowing the county to remain 
in charge of the program but only if comparable savings can be demonstrated.

HYDROPOWER HIGHLIGHTED IN SDG&amp;E BUYOUT PLAN

If the government took over San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. today, the new 
municipal utility might be able to buy lower-cost electricity from the Pacific 
Northwest, but it would be difficult to transmit that power to San Diego County 
customers, utility industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Investor-owned utilities control most of the power lines that link California 
with the Pacific Northwest. For 20 years they have effectively blocked most of 
California's municipal utilities from using the lines to transmit power from 
other western states. Only the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the 
nation's largest municipal electric utility, enjoys significant transmission 
access. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Off With Merger 
</P>
<P>
Gaining access to those transmission lines is so difficult that, under today's 
conditions, San Diegans who favor hydroelectric power might be better off under 
the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric with Southern California 
Edison, the Rosemead-based utility that controls a hefty portion of the 
transmission system that links energy-hungry Southern California with the 
power-rich Northwest, say SDG&amp;E officials. 
</P>
<P>
But state Sen. Larry Stirling, who is trying to block the SDG&amp;E-Edison 
merger and replace it with a municipal buyout of SDG&amp;E, said he believes 
the power blockade could be broken by the construction of a new, 
"consumer-owned" power line. Eventually, Stirling added, the state could even 
condemn existing lines and purchase them for the regulated use of public and 
investor-owned utilities across the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hydropower as Main Plank 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, a San Diego Republican, is using the hydropower issue as a main plank 
in his argument for a government takeover of SDG&amp;E. He contends that a 
municipal utility would be better positioned, and more inclined, to buy clean, 
cheap power from the Northwest rather than investing more heavily in 
non-renewable and air-fouling fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
That hydropower, Stirling argues, could come from the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration and from BC Hydro, a Canadian company owned by the province of 
British Columbia. Hydropower is typically cheaper than electricity produced by 
oil- or gas-fired electrical generating plants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision for the next 100 years," Stirling said. "It's really an 
attitude or a process that says, 'We have a right as San Diegans to address our 
energy future.' " 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Bonneville and BC Hydro said their agencies have or plan to have 
sufficient surplus power to ship to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies market their electricity in two ways. One is a simple energy sale, 
where the purchaser buys the electricity for money. The alternative is what is 
known as a "capacity-energy exchange," where utilities transfer electricity 
back and forth to meet each other's needs during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
BC Hydro is on the verge of a major expansion aimed at the U.S. market, 
according to Doug Forrest, vice president of marketing for POWEREX, a BC Hydro 
subsidiary. He said the company is watching the San Diego situation closely. 
</P>
<P>
"The province wants to get into the long-term business of selling power to the 
U.S.," Forrest said. "Initially, we would be looking at 400 to 600 megawatts. 
But we think that's just a start." 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve Wright, manager of Bonneville Power's California marketing 
office, BPA has a dwindling supply of energy that it can put up for simple 
sale. But the agency has a surplus of 1,500 megawatts of capacity and is 
ideally suited to trading it with Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
When Southern California needs energy to power its air conditioners on hot 
summer days, the cooler Northwest usually has plenty to spare, Wright said. The 
California utilities can return the borrowed energy at night, when needs are 
lower, or in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utilities Still Benefit 
</P>
<P>
Although the California utilities typically return more energy than they 
receive, they still benefit because the transfers allow them to postpone or 
avoid building new, expensive power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the cost of energy they're providing to us is less than what it 
would cost them to meet their capacity needs without us, then they're getting a 
good deal," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal laws give California's municipal utilities a slight advantage over 
investor-owned companies in bidding for Bonneville's power. While the price is 
the same for either entity, an investor-owned utility would have its supply 
curtailed sooner in the event of a shortage, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
But SDG&amp;E officials downplay the value of hydropower for Southern 
California. The San Diego utility currently has no long-term contracts for 
hydropower, and, in 1988, when low rainfall limited the supply of hydropower on 
the spot market, SDG&amp;E used the resource for just 2.5% of its needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if SDG&amp;E used all the hydropower it could now transmit to San Diego, 
the supply would only meet about 10% of SDG&amp;E's total customer demand for 
electricity, according to SDG&amp;E Power Contracts Supervisor Mike Strong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Loaded Up as Best We Can' 
</P>
<P>
"If we continued to be independent, we would continue to use hydropower as we 
have in the past," said Jim Kenney, SDG&amp;E's manager of fuels and power 
contracts. "We have loaded up as best we can during times when hydro is 
plentiful. I suppose during times when certain hydro contracts come up for 
renewal, we will probably put in to get an allocation of it." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney added that the proposed merger with Edison, which has access to roughly 
1,500 megawatts of hydropower, would probably bring more of the resource to San 
Diego than either the status quo or a government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego will wind up with a higher mix of hydro than it has today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if hydropower were available and a San Diego customer wanted to buy more 
of it, getting the electricity to the county would be difficult, many in the 
industry say. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that California's north-south transmission system -- 
like the state's freeway system -- is old and crowded. Building new 
transmission lines is an expensive and time-consuming process because local 
residents usually oppose them as undesirable land uses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Problem 
</P>
<P>
There is an additional problem: The public owns the state's freeway system, but 
the Pacific Intertie, the only north-south high-voltage transmission system 
connecting California and the Pacific Northwest, is controlled largely by 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The two investor-owned utilities control about two-thirds of two lines that 
travel through California to the Oregon border. Edison, PG&amp;E and the Los 
Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power, the nation's largest municipal system, 
control 86% of a third line that cuts through Nevada on its way to the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
That ownership structure has severely limited use of the lines by other 
Southern California municipal utilities such as Anaheim, Riverside and Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the municipal systems initiated a federal court battle to gain 
access to the intertie. Transmission has gained in importance because "we're 
like islands in the middle of Edison," according to Gordon Hoyt, general 
manager of Anaheim's municipal utility. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Matt, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has represented the municipal 
utilities in their fight to gain access to the intertie, said the municipals 
are basing their legal claim on a St. Louis railroad case decided in the early 
1900s. A judge in that case determined that one train company could not refuse 
to give competitors access to a bridge over a river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Year-Old Battle Continuing 
</P>
<P>
"Without that bridge, you couldn't reach the train terminal, and without that 
terminal, you didn't have a business," Matt said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old federal court battle is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Edison critics contend that the Rosemead-based utility simply doesn't want to 
give publicly owned competitors in California access to cheaper hydropower 
available in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like saying there's so much food in the world that nobody need 
starve," according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers 
Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "Supply isn't the problem -- 
distribution is." 
</P>
<P>
Edison declined to discuss available capacity on the intertie lines that it 
owns. "That is something that will be discussed in (upcoming) regulatory 
proceedings," Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps said last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
340-Mile Line Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Concern about future access to transmission lines led 15 municipal utilities in 
Northern California to propose a 340-mile transmission line that could become 
operational by 1993, according to Steve McClary, a staff person with the 
Sacramento-based Transmission Agency of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
and the Modesto Irrigation District, would own 42% of the proposed 
"California-Oregon Transmission Project." Municipal utilities in Southern 
California -- such as Anaheim, Riverside and Banning -- would own about 7.5% of 
the new line. 
</P>
<P>
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities would own 40% of the 
project. Edison would own 17.5%, PG&amp;E would own 20.4% and SDG&amp;E would 
own 2.9%. However, the state Public Utilities Commission has yet to grant 
required permits that would clear the way for the investor-owned utilities to 
take part in the $400-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Stirling suggests that a municipal utility in San Diego could dramatically 
increase SDG&amp;E's share of that line or work to build yet another. He also 
said he will support legislation first proposed last year to require all 
utilities to provide access to their lines to "wheel" power around the system. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Stirling advocates a public takeover of all the state's 
long-distance power lines, an idea that would be fiercely fought by the 
investor-owned utilities that built the lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Should Condemn Interties 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the interties are public networks is to me the right answer," 
Stirling said. "There are some things that it is just better to have a consumer 
network do. This is one of them. The state ought to go ahead and condemn all 
the interties and pay for them, and make clear that the interties are available 
to anyone who wants to transport electricity, north or south." 
</P>
<P>
That politically Draconian solution would give municipals access to cheaper 
hydropower produced by the Bonneville Power Administration. But it still would 
be difficult to transmit power from BC Hydro, because transmission through 
Washington and Oregon is largely controlled by Portland Power &amp; Light, a 
subsidiary of Portland-based Pacificorp, which recently merged with Utah Power 
&amp; Light. 
</P>
<P>
In that merger, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required the newly 
created utility to open up transmission access to competing utilities. But the 
utility contends that there is no room on the lines for its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
California's municipal utilities have asked federal regulators to order similar 
transmission access in the proposed merger between Edison and SDG&amp;E. Not 
surprisingly, Edison is opposing any federal attempt to broaden transmission 
access. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling acknowledges that today's conditions are not the best for a municipal 
utility hoping to gain access to Northwest power. But he brushes aside many of 
the problems by saying that he is "dealing not in what is, but what can be." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of investing in hydropower would be nothing compared with the price 
the United States has paid to keep oil flowing into this country from abroad, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have polluted our beaches, we have distorted our economy, we have subjected 
ourselves to Middle Eastern warfare, sacrificing the lives of our servicemen," 
Stirling said. "It has been an incredible national effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting a power link from here to Bonneville pales in comparison."

CLUES FOUND FOR FISH OIL'S ROLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists report they have evidence that might explain why fish oil would be 
effective for treating diseases in which the immune system malfunctions, like 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
A fatty acid found in fish oil appears to suppress key immune system hormones, 
perhaps preventing the immune system from attacking the joints and other parts 
of the body in autoimmune diseases, the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have the mechanism as to why this may work," said Dr. Charles 
Dinarello, a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine who 
headed the research. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to apparently reducing the risk of heart disease, previous studies 
have suggested that substances in fish oil known as n-3 or omega-3 fatty acids 
appear effective in treating a variety of autoimmune diseases. In autoimmune 
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, the immune system 
apparently malfunctions, attacking the joints and skin respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dinarello and 
his colleagues gave nine healthy volunteers commercially available fish oil 
concentrate for six weeks and measured the blood levels of substances known as 
interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. The levels of the two substances, 
which are important hormones involved in causing inflammations, dropped sharply 
for up to 10 weeks after the supplementation, a finding the researchers called 
"striking."

CAUTION ON PREGNANCY TESTS

<P>
Women using home pregnancy tests apparently get incorrect results about 10% of 
the time because they make mistakes using the tests, raising unfounded hopes 
and fears, researchers said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a new study evaluating two popular home pregnancy tests, the 
researchers said the tests themselves are highly accurate when used properly, 
but they are so complicated that users often produce errors. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the kits themselves are accurate and perform well. But in 
the hands of lay people who are not used to doing home testing, many mistakes 
can be made," said Jocelyn Hicks, chairwoman of laboratory medicine at 
Children's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington. Hicks recommended 
the tests and instructions be simplified. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the companies that make the two tests involved in Hicks' study 
said they were confident in the accuracy of their products and the clarity of 
the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks obtained 200 urine samples from urban adolescents and gave them to a 
variety of non-technical hospital employees, such as secretaries and janitors, 
to test with two popular home pregnancy tests. A test, sold as e.p.t. Plus and 
made by Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., produced incorrect results 
-- false positives and false negatives -- in 9.5% of the cases. A test called 
ADVANCE and made by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., produced false 
results in 12.5% of the cases, the researchers said.

PUPILS FIND FAST TRACK ENDS AFTER JUNIOR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reed Junior High School ninth-grader Jon Sorenson, who has taken every math 
class offered by Los Angeles schools, says the district's treatment of its 
smartest kids just doesn't add up. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no math classes I can take when I get to high school," said Sorenson, 
13, who has already received college credit for a second-year calculus course 
that he took at the North Hollywood school. 
</P>
<P>
Sorenson's problem is not as rare as it might seem. Several hundred students 
identified by school district psychologists as highly gifted, having IQs of at 
least 145, graduate from accelerated elementary and junior high school programs 
such as Reed's only to find that no high schools offer the same fast-paced 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the district's brightest students are forced to either start college 
early or coast through high school classes covering material that they've 
already learned, say students, teachers and parents critical of the present 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Want School 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a high school for advanced studies has prompted a group of San 
Fernando Valley parents to revive a 1986 proposal to create one. The parents, 
whose highly gifted children attend Carpenter Avenue Elementary School in 
Studio City, say private foundations and corporations are willing to help pay a 
large part of the proposal's multimillion-dollar price tag. 
</P>
<P>
But money, though significant, probably won't be the biggest obstacle facing a 
high school for the highly gifted, according to those in and out of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the bureaucracy," said Paul Mertens, a history teacher who has taught 
highly gifted students at Reed for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say regular high schools are doing a good job of teaching 
the highly gifted. There are already a number of district programs, including 
about 25 advanced placement courses, through which students can earn college 
credit by passing tests, said Daniel M. Isaacs, the district's high school 
division superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids go on to every major university," said Lorna Round, the district's 
associate superintendent of instruction. "So their educational needs are being 
dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular School Programs 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the district's 3,700 highly gifted students do not go to such 
schools as Reed or the highly successful magnet schools that have special 
programs, said Sheila Smith, who heads the district's gifted and highly gifted 
programs. "We work very hard on our regular school programs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But that approach wastes the district's most precious resource, said Milton 
Kopelman, principal of the 50-year-old Bronx High School of Science in New 
York. The school, which admits only those students who pass a rigorous 
examination, is nationally known for its graduates, four of whom have won Nobel 
Prizes in science. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vitally important for governments to do something with their gifted 
students," Kopelman said. "You can't let them just hang out in regular schools, 
saying that because they are so bright they will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Districts are reluctant to create schools for highly gifted students because of 
complaints that they are "skimming off the best kids," Kopelman said. 
Unfortunately, "there are many regular schools where youngsters look down on 
kids who are interested in achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Reed Principal Charles Stewart, former principal of the Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts, said most principals will admit privately that schools 
often fall short in teaching the highly gifted. But he warned that students can 
be pushed too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"If a school becomes a junior university, there is the possibility of burnout, 
of kids getting turned off because of too much pressure on them," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Work 
</P>
<P>
But ninth-grade students attending Reed's highly gifted program said in a 
recent classroom interview that they are worried that they won't have enough 
work when they attend regular high school classes next year. Many of them have 
been together in highly gifted programs since grade school at Carpenter Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The students, whose IQ levels put them in the top 0.5% of the general 
population in intelligence, said they learn more from exchanging ideas with 
other smart youngsters. Such teachers as Mertens and math teacher Bill 
Fitz-Gibbon constantly push and challenge them, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
Most agreed that a high school for advanced studies is a good idea. But a few, 
such as Marissa Goodman, said they have grown tired of being secluded from 
regular students. "They think we're nerds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Kibrick, 15, said she hopes that the high school is a magnet school 
that will draw more minority students than the Reed program. Reed and Carpenter 
have drawn some criticism because their highly gifted programs are not required 
to comply with ethnic quotas that apply to magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is based solely on IQ, with the highest-scoring students being 
admitted first, school officials said. The Reed and Carpenter programs predate 
the district's magnet school program, which was created to attract white 
students to minority neighborhood schools, district officials said. The two 
schools, unlike magnets, do not provide transportation for students traveling 
to them and receive no special funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spots for Minority Students 
</P>
<P>
To prevent criticism about minority enrollment, supporters of the advanced 
studies high school said they will set aside a certain number of places for 
minority students. Robert Claire, a parent and one of the organizers of the 
drive to create the high school, said the school will be academically 
challenging and ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
"No one questions spending for the educationally and physically handicapped; 
why not the highly gifted?" Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Claire has enlisted the help of school board President Roberta 
Weintraub, the East Valley board representative. "I'm 1,000% behind the idea," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley board member Julie Korenstein said she's interested in studying the 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
Both said the idea has come at a good time. The district in the next few weeks 
will begin studying an ambitious expansion of its magnet school program, 
Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been feelings by other board members about this being elitist, but 
high IQ occurs for all races, incomes and nationalities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
District statistics bear that out. Of the district's 3,700 highly gifted 
students, about 34% are white and the rest are minority, including 30% Latino, 
6% black and 25% Asian, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administrators Critical 
</P>
<P>
Because such a small number of gifted and highly gifted students are among the 
district's nearly 600,000 students, many administrators are reluctant to 
support a school that would take away their best students. Others say students 
who are isolated with only the very brightest don't learn how to get along with 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is not just upper-edge people," said Joan Martin, coordinator of the 
Van Nuys High School Magnet centers for math, science and arts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the students from highly gifted junior high schools who attend the Van Nuys 
High School Magnet, those who do well "are the ones who get along with people, 
who lose the arrogance they hang onto that they get from schools that put a 
gifted label above their forehead," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
But former Reed student and Harvard physics graduate Ron K. Unz said an 
advanced studies school would inspire regular students to higher achievement 
"by showing how much can be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems with not having these kinds of schools, and having people 
around who are just as smart as you, is that you get the idea that you're the 
smartest guy around," Unz said.

The Killing Game by M. R. Henderson (St. Martin's Press: $17.95; 304 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Another cozy little book about a serial killer and his final comeuppance. This 
one may be pleasant for Los Angeles readers because it's set in the Los Feliz 
district -- all the fine little social distinctions about whether you live 
above Los Feliz Boulevard in a big house or below Los Feliz in a stuffy 
apartment -- whether you hang out on Fountain Avenue or Vermont -- all these 
are dually observed. One segment of the readership for "The Killing Game," 
then, includes graduates of John Marshall High School. 
</P>
<P>
Others who might like "The Killing Game" are those who collect Hollywood or 
movie novels, either for a hobby or for purposes of scholarship. As long as the 
genre of the "movie novel" has existed (as far as I know, since "Love Story of 
a Movie Star," 1905), the hoary question of appearance-and-reality has been 
addressed in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Love Story of a Movie Star": a band of nomadic movie makers roams the streets 
of New York. A woman leans out of a burning building, holding a bundle: "Help! 
Save my child!" But first the movie-gypsies film the real disaster; only then 
do they save the desperate mother and her baby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implausible Plot 
</P>
<P>
So, here in "The Killing Game," a nice girl named Jeanne from Minneapolis is 
hired by her old teacher to be an assistant director in a Hollywood movie. (If 
you believe that, you'll believe anything.) Jeanne and her husband, Glenn, move 
out here, and within the first few days, Glenn is crunched in a freeway 
accident that puts him hors de combat and in a permanently bad mood for the 
rest of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne is stuck in a depressing Los Feliz apartment with grumpy convalescing 
Glenn. But she meets, in quick order, Mark Bonner, the pleasant neighbor down 
the hall; Terry Faust, her film's director (she knew him already; he gave her 
the job); Brad Raven, the mean producer; Wray Jarvis, the handsome leading man 
of this movie, which is . . . The story of a serial killer! But listen to this! 
Even as Jeanne keeps working on the film, a serial killer begins a crime spree 
right there in the Los Feliz district, and each murder directly follows the 
circumstances in the script. So, odds are that the killer is somebody involved 
in the movie, or at least somebody who's read the script. 
</P>
<P>
"The Killing Game" goes on that way, really very much like a game: First a 
chapter for the killer, then a chapter for Jeanne, then a chapter for the 
killer, then a chapter for Jeanne, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Bad Book 
</P>
<P>
And, because there's absolutely nothing scary about this book and because it's 
well-written, and because if you haven't guessed the murderer yourself by now, 
it's not a bad novel to take to somebody in the hospital or to buy when you're 
going on a long trip. "The Killing Game" is OK. 
</P>
<P>
But I'd like to bring up the question, since life does so often imitate art, 
why can't some of these authors who write about serial killers turn that job 
description into some kind of equal opportunity employment? Why do these bozos 
always have to be killing pretty young women? I, personally, get a little bored 
reading about terrified young girls getting their eyeballs jabbed out with ice 
picks, or getting strung up with twine and hacked to death while their killer 
is having an orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there anybody else in this society who deserves killing? How about an 
unfairly taxed maniac going after every bureaucrat in his local branch of the 
IRS? How about an assistant professor, denied tenure, killing off every member 
of his department? You could title that one "Murder by Degree," right? How 
about a crazy man, on a sugar-high, going after the makers of every weird brand 
of frosted flakes? That way he really could be a "cereal" killer. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a thought.

ANDY-MANIA IS ALIVE AND WELL IN NEW YORK

<P>
Andy would have loved it. He would have loved the big yellow banner luffing in 
the cold outside the Museum of Modern Art announcing "Andy Warhol, A 
Retrospective." First since 1971. First since his death in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Still famous after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
He would have loved the fact that -- even before the 300-work survey opened to 
the public today -- a record 10,000 fans turned out for members' previews, the 
press opening drew 500 journalists, and the museum was inundated with requests 
from network television, which usually treats art shows the way headwaiters 
treat panhandlers. Even MTV came. Steve Martin and Paul Simon were seen among 
the usual art world luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
The milk-pale little man with the silver wig snapped to his forehead would have 
been shyly thrilled that the exhibition will travel to Chicago, London, 
Cologne, Milan and Paris after it closes here May 2. Since he worshiped the 
movies, he might have been a bit disappointed that his show -- including a 
dozen of his underground films -- will not come to Los Angeles. Well, so are 
we. He had his first solo show at La Cienega's old Ferus Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, however, he would have brightened again at the serious and aesthetically 
dignified way his oeuvre is presented by curator Kynaston McShine. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, maybe not. After all, this is the artist who, more than any 
other, wedded fine art to popular culture, promoting a breakthrough rock band, 
publishing a gossip magazine, selling commercial endorsements and generally 
making his name as much of a household word as, well, Campbell's soup. 
</P>
<P>
"Warhol" became as inescapable a signature of the '60s as the Kennedys or the 
Beatles. Warhol literally forged our visual image of the decade with his 
deadpan, silk-screened Brillo boxes and images of glamorous sexpots repeated 
like so many sheets of postage stamps. He demythified the idea of the artist's 
studio by calling his the Factory and remythified the notion of the bohemian 
loser by dubbing members of his exotic-oddball entourage "Superstars" with 
names like International Velvet and Candy Darling. 
</P>
<P>
The Warhol that remained the boy Andrew Warhola, the frail star-struck 
autograph hound from Pittsburgh, thought all these besotted misfits were magic 
until one of them -- a frenzied radical feminist named Valerie Solanas -- shot 
him nearly to death in 1968. After that he retreated, frightened, into 
conventional celebrity in the fashion of his friend and longtime infatuation, 
Truman Capote. 
</P>
<P>
Funny. In her recent Warhol memoir, "Famous for Fifteen Minutes" former 
superstar Ultra Violet observed that most of the Factory faithful were, like 
herself and Andy, fallen-away Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Warhol died absurdly at 58 following a gall bladder operation, the 
priests of art tended to regard him as a has-been and a sellout who lived on 
past glory and cranked out uninspired commissioned portraits for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was discovered that the aging street urchin who wore panty hose and 
schlepped a shopping bag had led a double life. The hip leather-and-mylar 
Phantom of the Media lived in a frumpy Victorian brownstone with his Czech 
mother until she died in 1972, convinced that her Andy went to Mass every 
Sunday. The house was chockablock with compulsive collections ranging from 
cookie jars to carrousel horses. When the collections went on the auction 
block, record prices made it clear that Andy-mania was not dead. His estate, 
</P>
<P>
according to one estimate, was worth $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol defined an artist as someone who markets his aura. His is so 
inextricably meshed with his work that it will not be simple to separate them. 
All the same, the impressive exhibition tends to return one to an older 
estimate of Warhol as an artist of the weight and magnitude of a Jackson 
Pollock and an artistic personality as beloved as Salvador Dali. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly did Warhol accomplish? In radical contrast to the intense 
subjectivity of the Abstract Expressionists, he placed a mirror in front of a 
more public and generalized American Dream. It is the dream of the little guy 
sitting sopping up fantasies of wealth, glamour and fame from the newspaper, 
the radio and the television, constructing a world from the vulgar phantoms of 
the media. They seem more real than his own boring life even though utterly 
without substance. 
</P>
<P>
The first works in the exhibition are a series of paintings based on comic 
strip panels -- Superman, Dick Tracy and Popeye circa 1960. They tend to bear 
out Robert Hughes' notion that the keys to Warhol's sensibility are his 
homosexuality and his Catholicism. There is a gay campiness and nostalgia about 
them as well as a devotional quality of hero worship. 
</P>
<P>
But their most striking quality -- so far up front that we are liable to miss 
it for sheer obviousness -- is their incredible detachment. This is the art of 
a man who simply and openly did not want to have feelings. He did not want to 
be touched or hurt or comforted when he had a bullet in his chest. Yet he told 
Ultra Violet that he chose Dick Tracy, Popeye and Superman because he had had 
sexual fantasies about them as a boy. As a man he came to long for disembodied 
sex, robot sex. 
</P>
<P>
What it seems we should look for in Warhol's art is a kind of oblique closeted 
confession, and sure enough that is what we find. A series of early 
black-and-white ads for water heaters, drills and the like tap into the 
Dadaists tactic of using mechanical objects as sexual metaphors. By the time we 
get to "Campbell's Soup Can With Can Opener" we know we are dealing with an 
image of sadistic erotic violation. 
</P>
<P>
Come on. How do we know it isn't just a soup can? The same way we know when 
Warhol is making great art and when he making lousy art. His best work has a 
riveted intensity. The images are terse, direct and honed even when they appear 
to be mere silk-screen copies of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
We know because Warhol evokes a surprising range of emotions for an artist who 
pretended not to have any. There's a beatific sweetness in his do-it-yourself 
paintings of sailboats and flowers. There is terrible moral despair in the 
disaster paintings of suicides, race riots and bloody bodies draped across 
ambulances. They have the horror of a Francis Bacon, but their detachment 
doubles the chill. They seem to say, "Hey, man, I don't know what's the matter 
with me. I see all these terrible things on the news and I just go on eating my 
TV dinner. Do you ever do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, we do, but we don't own up to it. We pass by our freezing hearts 
like we shrug off a beggar. Warhol's candor is disarming. He never held himself 
up as a model for anybody. He was an open travesty of his own creepiness and so 
became an Everyman for shy persons with megalomaniac longings. He liked money 
so he painted it. He like Del Monte Peaches so he painted them. He worshiped 
fame so he painted its icons tirelessly but somehow with a consciousness of 
them as monstrous illusion and lethal trap. His holy virgin was Marilyn Monroe 
on a gold background. His "Triple Elvis" is an hallucinatory masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the decade we see him slipping. His rigorous selection of 
images gives way to journalistic disengagement and show-biz sentimentality. He 
paints the collector Ethel Skull 36 times from photo booth pictures, just 
standing back laconically letting her make a fool of herself. He paints the 
artist Joseph Beuys and you wonder why he has selected an artist so utterly 
unlike himself. The image has no resonance. 
</P>
<P>
He strikes the note once again with his monumental faces of Chairman Mao, but 
the idea goes sour. It's shockingly funny to present the Chinese Communist 
patriarch as the World's Greatest Celebrity, but it is so profoundly dumb that 
it boomerangs and makes Warhol look like a twit along with a million pulp 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Warhol was an outsider spinning dreams of fame, glamour and wealth, 
he made prescient, lean-hungry art full of American-immigrant shyness, longing 
and alien insight. 
</P>
<P>
Once he became an insider, he lost it, painting his fellow luminaries with the 
lugubrious chumminess of Sammy Davis Jr. on a TV spectacular. Oh, Liza, I love 
your eyes. Oh, Mick, I love your lips. 
</P>
<P>
He performed the weary trick of putting his trademark on art history, 
Warholizing Pollock, Edvard Munch and even Leonardo. Picasso got away with 
that, not little Andy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a tragic dimension to most great modern art that has to do with the 
fact that almost no truly creative people know exactly what they are doing. 
They bumble in and out of their greatness without really knowing what is 
special about it. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol's instincts led him to create a purgatorially realistic panorama of the 
vanity of a society whose paradise vision is formed by hype. His heartless 
naivete is a drag-queen mirror of what it portrays. In every picture he 
confesses he is a monstrous camera depicting a monstrous camera and in so doing 
issues a priestly caution that redeems him. He was an Expressionist frozen into 
a TV dinner. 
</P>
<P>
He told the art world where it was headed and labeled the gate: "Abandon Hope." 
Nobody listened.

RESTORED 'LAWRENCE' CONQUERS NEW YORK PREMIERE AUDIENCE

<P>
A capacity crowd braved freezing temperatures here Saturday night to bask in 
the sun-scorched glories of the kind of film making that Hollywood doesn't do 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie premiere for the newly restored "Lawrence of Arabia" culminated 
an epic struggle to locate, repair and re-edit footage that began disappearing 
within weeks of the film's initial release, back in December, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three premieres marking the film's re-release. Sunday's 
Washington premiere was held at the Cineplex Odeon Circle Avalon Theater. And 
the Los Angeles premiere will be held Sunday at the Cineplex Odeon Century 
Plaza, where the film officially opens Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hacked-away over the years, first so that exhibitors could squeeze in more 
screenings, then so that television could squeeze the movie into a time slot 
(and squeeze its sprawling 70-millimeter images into a TV format), "Lawrence" 
-- winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture -- acquired a kind of 
legend through the years, becoming a cause celebre among film 
historians/lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The thunder of applause that greeted the film's latest adventure would seem to 
signify that the saga of T. E. Lawrence, the unlikely hero who helped to unite 
Arab tribesmen in their battles against the Turks, is once again off and 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
Restored to director Sir David Lean's original cut, the 3-hour, 40-minute 
"Lawrence" mesmerized the crowd that filled the more than 1,200 seats of the 
Art Deco-studded Ziegfeld Theater on West 54th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the night's excitement: the presence of Lean himself, and his two 
once-unknown stars, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were Oscar-winning editor Anne V. Coates (who wore a purple, 
rhinestone-studded Middle Eastern caftan "especially for the occasion") and 
Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young. 
</P>
<P>
The night's other VIPs included Robert A. Harris and Jim Painten, producers of 
the restoration; film makers/restoration-preservation advocates Martin Scorsese 
and Steven Spielberg; and Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel. (It was 
Scorsese and Spielberg who convinced Steel that the studio should back the 
restoration.) 
</P>
<P>
For O'Toole, the night marked the opportunity to "see my old chums again." 
(With understated aplomb, O'Toole said, "This is all awfully nice.") 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to yesterday's epic motion pictures, O'Toole added, "We'd make them 
tomorrow if we could." He smiled at Sharif as he quipped, "Just think -- if we 
did 'Lawrence' again, I could play the Alec Guinness part and he could play 
Tony Quinn's role." 
</P>
<P>
For Sharif, it was his first "Lawrence" screening since 1962. "I can still 
remember that very first premiere in 1962. Then I was so nervous. I had no way 
of knowing how the audience would react. Would they like the picture? Would 
they like me?" 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm seeing an old friend I haven't seen for a long, long time," 
said a jubilant Lean. The seriousness of the night was echoed by Scorsese and 
Spielberg. Said Scorsese: "This is not a film that was made in 1925. It's not a 
movie no one has ever heard of. This film is a legend. It won Oscars. It has 
stars who have become household names. And there are moments from this film 
that people associate with those stars." He sighed: "That a movie like 
'Lawrence' could have deteriorated so quickly. That is truly alarming." 
</P>
<P>
American Film Institute director Jean Firstenberg introduced the "Lawrence" 
participants as they lined up in front of the theater's massive gold curtains. 
"We are in the midst of film history tonight," she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Underwritten by Columbia, the film's three premieres will benefit the AFI's 
film preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrence" will play only New York, Washington and Los Angeles to begin with. 
The reason: prints are costly (just under $40,000 each) and few modern theaters 
are capable of showing a film of "Lawrence's" wide-screen scope. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder then that Lean created a stir among the Ziegfeld audience when he 
kicked off the screening by looking at the theater's massive screen, and 
proclaimed: "This is what the movies should be shown on." 
</P>
<P>
That said, the overture began. (The film's stirring score earned Maurice Jarre 
an Academy Award.) So did the applause. It grew thunderous when Lean's name 
appeared. There was applause, too, for the stars' credits -- as well as an 
audible gasp when the words "And introducing Peter O'Toole" appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lawrence" celebration continued later that night, as a crowd of 600 (who 
had paid $250 to $1,000 a ticket) gathered for a dinner in the Grand Ballroom 
of the Pierre Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of starry names among the crowd, including Sylvester Stallone, 
Christopher Reeve, Jane Alexander and Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mets' first baseman Keith Hernandez was there, too -- signing 
autographs and searching for some himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying his 1962 souvenir "Lawrence" movie program, Hernandez worked the room 
getting the movie's cast and crew to sign it. "I got it when I first saw the 
film. I was about 9. I never, ever forgot it," said Hernandez. "I couldn't wait 
to see this movie again." 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrencemania" also struck Manhattan Beach attorney Rick Lesser, who came with 
his 5-year-old son, Ricky (who wore a little tux). "I spent $250 a ticket -- 
and Ricky isn't subbing for anyone," Lesser said. "I really wanted him to be a 
part of this night. I still remember the first time I saw 'Lawrence.' It was 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
As for what the movie magic means to the modern studio executive, Dawn Steel 
was upfront: "I'm not about to compare 'Lawrence' with any of our other 
(upcoming) titles. That wouldn't be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steel: "With this movie, you're talking about perfection -- or as close 
to it as you can get. You just don't get better than David Lean."

MEXICAN FARM TRADE MAY MOVE ON 2-WAY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past seven or eight years, Cardinal Distributing Co. in Coachella, 
Calif., has contracted with growers in Mexico to produce the asparagus and 
green onions -- crops that require a lot of field work -- that the U.S. company 
then sells on this side of the 2,000-mile common border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking advantage of the labor market in Mexico," explained Nicholas H. 
Jarrett, Cardinal's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett is not crazy about buying from Mexico produce that grows up and down 
the Coachella Valley. But, he explained: "Labor is the biggest part of the end 
cost, and to stay competitive we have to grow in Mexico. We're in it for the 
economics -- but we'd just as soon not be." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal is not alone today among U.S. agricultural concerns exporting part of 
their operations to Mexico to benefit from that country's ample supply of cheap 
labor. Several competitors are moving their carrot-packing operations from 
Coachella to Mexico -- shipping California-grown produce south for handling, 
then bringing it back for sale in the United States. And other firms, such as 
two-year-old Andrew &amp; Williamson Sales in San Diego, capitalize on Mexico's 
trade advantages: They import seasonal crops, such as tomatoes and 
strawberries, that ripen earlier in Baja and therefore command premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
But, although such moves may increase Mexico's agricultural sales to the United 
States at the expense of California produce, many trade specialists think that 
Mexico's long-depressed and highly protected market for foreign food is about 
to swing open once again. They maintain that agricultural trade in both 
directions is on the brink of significant expansion for the first time since 
Mexico's oil boom collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, farm trade between the two countries, which had been flowing modestly 
in Mexico's favor since 1986, is near equilibrium and will probably shift to a 
U.S. surplus this year -- and possibly a strong one at that. U.S. farm exports 
last October and November, the first two months of the government's new fiscal 
year, soared to $533.6 million. For the same months a year earlier, sales 
totaled $181 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mexico's shipments north increased modestly to $190.9 million, up 
from $184.3 million, according to the government figures. 
</P>
<P>
So Western growers, these experts maintain, might well focus less on fears of 
an invasion of the United States by low-cost Mexican produce and processing, 
and more on increased export opportunities for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico appears to be moving into the position of becoming a larger market for 
U.S. agricultural products," Leon G. Mears, agricultural counselor at the U.S. 
Embassy in Mexico City, wrote in a recent assessment. "Anticipated changes in 
Mexico's agricultural production and trade in the next few years are likely to 
have a considerable effect on the quantity and composition of its agricultural 
imports." 
</P>
<P>
California, at least, appears to anticipate significant growth in two-way trade 
across its southern border. Gov. George Deukmejian, who last year opened state 
trade offices in London and Tokyo, will dedicate a third foreign outpost next 
month -- this one in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
In his analysis, Mears pinned his optimism on anticipated economic growth and 
increased income in Mexico. That, he calculated, should boost consumption of 
meat, dairy products and eggs, which declined by up to 30% from the 
pre-recession high in 1981. U.S. food exports to Mexico reached a record $2.7 
billion that year before plunging to less than $1.5 billion in a year. After 
bottoming out at $1.1 billion in 1986, however, they are again approaching the 
$2-billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's population is growing rapidly, and a larger proportion of it is young, 
which translates into a hungrier country, Mears said. In addition, urbanization 
continues at a rapid pace: Although 30% of the country's inhabitants lived in 
cities in 1950, 60% had moved to town by 1980. That is significant in terms of 
agricultural trade, he said, because urban consumers tend to buy more animal 
products and processed foods than do rural residents, many of whom also grow 
some of their own food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Trade Boom 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, migration, particularly to the United States, is expected to slow 
because of changes in immigration laws. And Mexico is experiencing a boom in 
the tourist trade, which attracted 5.5 million visitors last year and is 
expected to draw 8 million by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
That dynamic backdrop adds significance to the fact that Mexico traditionally 
buys 70% of its food imports from the United States and has greatly liberalized 
its trade policy over the past five years, Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
This start on reducing tariffs, licensing requirements and other import 
barriers was a precondition to Mexico's joining the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade in 1986. A year later, Mexico signed a bilateral pact with 
the United States that, Mears said, "should provide for further trade 
liberalization." 
</P>
<P>
The question is what form future liberalization might take, said Scott D. Morse 
of Morse Merchant Agribusiness, a San Francisco consulting firm that 
specializes in trade finance and regulation. It will likely require U.S. 
producers to give up some of the tariff protection that they enjoy on a wide 
range of commodities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential for Growth 
</P>
<P>
A further significant reduction in food trade barriers, Morse said, could 
quadruple California's farm trade with Mexico. This accounted for only about 2% 
of the state's $3.34 billion in total agricultural exports in 1987, but the 
potential for growth is considerable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mears said significant export opportunities for U.S. farmers exist for a 
variety of "high-value agricultural products." These include almonds, walnuts, 
cherries, apples, peaches, pears, sweet corn and dried fruits. In addition, 
high-quality beef is needed to meet the tastes of Mexico's expanding tourist 
trade. And wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages are in demand; also wood 
products, animal skins and hides, and prepared animal and poultry feeds. 
</P>
<P>
Mears is not alone in his optimistic outlook for growth in Mexico's food 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmye S. Hillman, an agricultural economist at the University of Arizona, told 
the American Farm Bureau Federation last month in San Antonio that "healthy 
economic tendencies" are in the wind. Mexico, he noted, already is the United 
States' third-largest agricultural trading partner (after Japan and Canada), 
and the U.S. market is Mexico's largest outlet for its farm exports. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman said he expects Mexico to become more dependent on the United States 
for food imports. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not happen without encouragement, Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza 
(D-Tex.), chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, told the U.S. farm 
group. "Mexico is in a very difficult situation, and we have to help them out." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the disparity in labor costs represents a major Mexican 
advantage in terms of its agricultural trade with the United States, as the 
Coachella firms tapping into that resource demonstrate. And that worries some 
farm groups, which complain that government policies -- federal and state -- 
often magnify foreign competitors' trade advantages by unnecessarily increasing 
domestic costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our growers just can't be expected to compete with Mexican growers paying 
daily wages equal to our hourly rates," said David Moore, president of 
Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., which represents 2,700 produce growers, 
packers and shippers in California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move 'Off Shore' Feared 
</P>
<P>
The danger, spokeswoman Barbara Buck said, is that domestic farm interests, as 
happened earlier with automobiles, steel and textiles, will move "offshore," 
attracted by lower production costs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that, economically and with no emotions, that wouldn't be a bad 
thing," Buck acknowledged, "but these are families, living on family farms -- 
for four generations, some of them. It's going to be difficult to have it be a 
purely economical decision." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, increasing Mexico's standard of living to reduce the labor 
imbalance may be impossible without long-term U.S. aid, suggested Henry J. 
Voss, a Ceres rancher who heads the California Farm Bureau. "There is no reason 
why Mexico someday should not be as big a trade partner as Canada is," Voss 
said, "but there is a need for a great amount of California investment in 
Mexico to bring that about. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving a lot more aid to other countries than to Mexico right next 
door."

Mattel Inc., where shrinking operations have left office and parking spaces 
vacant, is completing a deal to trade most of its 36-acre headquarters complex 
in Hawthorne to a developer in return for office space in a $150-million 
mixed-use project on the site. Comstock, Crosser &amp; Hickey Development Co. 
of Manhattan Beach is to renovate Mattel's six-story tower and build the toy 
company a second office building and parking structure on eight acres of the 
site. In exchange, the developer will receive the remaining land, where it will 
build office space, a hotel, restaurants, a health club, a large retail store 
and perhaps a shopping center.

Chrysler Motors Corp. said it was restructuring its vehicle engineering 
operations to focus product development on an entire vehicle rather than its 
components. Chrysler Motors is Chrysler Corp.'s auto-making arm. Under the 
restructuring, the engineering operations will be divided into four basic 
groups, with support units also being created. The support units include 
scientific laboratories and Chrysler's proving grounds. No layoffs in the 
6,000-worker Chrysler engineering organization are planned, the statement said.

Murray Industries Inc., maker of Chris-Craft pleasure boats, has been sold for 
about $58 million to Outboard Marine Corp. of Waukegan, Ill. The sale came in a 
spirited auction in the Tampa, Fla., courtroom of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 
Alexander Paskay, who has been overseeing Chris-Craft since Dec. 9, when it 
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
code. Murray, based in Bradenton, Fla., had been virtually paralyzed since the 
filing, which listed $70 million in debts and less than $60 million in assets.

Dentsu Burson-Marsteller, a joint venture between Japan's largest advertising 
agency and a major U.S. public relations firm, opened an office in Los Angeles 
to provide communications counseling to Japanese companies doing business in 
the United States and based on the West Coast.

said extending the company's services to the Los Angeles market was a logical 
and necessary step. 
</P>
<P>
Richard de Leon will run the Los Angeles office. He previously was with the Los

Kim, Kang, Yun &amp; Co., an accounting firm founded by two Korean-Americans in 
Los Angeles, has merged into Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, one of the nation's 
Big Eight accounting firms. KKY, formed in 1980, has concentrated on providing 
accounting services to Korean-owned businesses and subsidiaries of Korea-based 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first Korean-American accounting firm to be acquired by a Big Eight 
firm. The major U.S. accounting companies have their eye on Korean clients for 
potential new business. Ten years ago, they moved into the Japanese market by 
merging with Japanese-American accounting firms that had Japan-based clients. 
</P>
<P>
KKY's founders, Dongsoon Kang and Nack Koo Kim, will become partners of 
DH&amp;S. The staff of 10 expands DH&amp;S National Korean Industry Client 
Services Group, which also has a bilingual staff of 12 in New York and three in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about the merger because it provides an excellent opportunity 
to service this vital segment of the Southern California business community, as 
well as to significantly expand our national effort," said Keith Renken, area 
managing partner for DH&amp;S. 
</P>
<P>
Among DH&amp;S' Korean clients are Sunkyong, Korea Explosives, Samsung, 
Goldstar, Daewoo, Hyosung and Kolon.

<P>
When Jerri Kiesler used to get upset, lonely, or bored, she'd pull out her 
dozen credit cards and zoom to the shopping malls in search of some little 
bauble to raise her spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked to go to specialty stores where they would call me by my name as I 
walked through the door," said the 50-year-old Dayton, Ohio, grandmother. "It 
gave me a feeling of self worth." 
</P>
<P>
Her mood changed as the bills arrived, followed by late notices, dunning 
letters and curt telephone calls from creditors. In two years, Kiesler amassed 
$12,000 in credit card debt, nearly half her annual income from an accounting 
job. There was no way she could pay all the bills. 
</P>
<P>
She now jokes that at least her trip to bankruptcy court was made in style, 
thanks to the dresses and more than 200 pairs of shoes she'd charged from 1984 
to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Kiesler, who filed for personal bankruptcy three years ago and has remained 
"clean" since, is one of many American credit card holders facing crippling 
financial problems from the enormous power of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Cash Advances 
</P>
<P>
The National Foundation for Consumer Credit says 2% of the 130 million 
Americans who buy on credit are mired in credit card debt, 4% face "some 
difficulties" and 10% experience "some discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
Some troubled card holders might take cash advances from one card to pay debt 
from another, the foundation says. Others dip into savings or borrow from 
friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Credit problems grow more acute this time of year because the Christmas bills 
have rolled in. The American Bankers Assn. says holiday credit card use rose 8% 
to 9% in 1988 over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Debt counselors and therapists say they've noticed a steady increase in the 
number of people with credit problems seeking help, and requests for assistance 
have intensified this month. 
</P>
<P>
Many claim that's partly because banks and credit card companies have lowered 
their standards by giving people far more credit than they can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Gatling, who runs the nonprofit Budget &amp; Credit Counseling Services 
Inc. in New York, said that while calls for help from debt-swamped clients 
might be more noticeable after the holidays, "this business doesn't really have 
an ebb or flow." 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that we got real busy at the end of January. But because of the 
proliferation of credit you don't see it as acutely," he said. "Christmas does 
heap on credit (and) . . . this may push some people over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
To help credit card addicts, the Maryland-based National Foundation for 
Consumer Credit, an umbrella group for services such as Gatling's, has nearly 
doubled its nationwide offices to about 400 in the last two years, said Donald 
L. Badders, foundation president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spendthrift Yuppies 
</P>
<P>
He said the number of individuals and families receiving budget counseling from 
them soared to 211,000 for the year ended Oct. 1 from 176,700 in 1987 and from 
118,000 five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"As baby boomers came of age in the past 10 years . . . the consuming public 
has grown," Badders said. "The complexity of consumer economics has grown." 
</P>
<P>
So has the spendthrift yuppie mentality, to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten to be a much more materialistic society. The cost of looking 
successful is going up and up," said Evan Steffans, a therapist at Miami Valley 
Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, who co-founded a Shopper Stoppers counseling program 
with Kiesler three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Badders said the percentage of debt-dogged consumers has remained fairly 
constant but the size of their debt is "a lot deeper than it was 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the average person counseled at the foundation offices in 1980 had 
about $9,000 in accumulated debt, compared to $15,000 in 1987 and $17,000 last 
year. Badders said credit card debt is the fastest growing component of overall 
consumer debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Marketing 
</P>
<P>
"This tells us that the percentage of those getting into trouble have taken 
advantage of more credit opportunities," he said. "What I've seen happen is 
more aggressive marketing on the part of credit card companies." 
</P>
<P>
That marketing, some credit counselors contend, can be irresponsible. The 
counselors complain that banks, in particular, don't adequately supervise 
different subsidiaries that peddle cards. 
</P>
<P>
Kiesler and many others who have faced even worse credit problems claim that 
they sometimes have received card applications from the same banks harassing 
them to pay delinquent bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a challenge to get credit cards. I still get applications," said 
Kiesler, now unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Funds at Risk' 
</P>
<P>
Joseph L. Boutin, an executive vice president for Howard Bank in Burlington, 
Vt., and an ABA executive vice president, said those cases are rare. He said 
most banks thoroughly check credit backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you're going to be able to find some banks that have lowered their 
standards for whatever reasons," Boutin said. "Most banks recognize when they 
make a loan they have to be paid back because we have deposit funds at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Still, more people who are normally considered a greater credit risk -- young 
adults, teens and modest-income earners -- hold a significant portion of the 
850 million credit cards in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Johnson, director of Purdue University's credit research center, said 
his most recent data show 21% of families with annual income of less than 
$10,000 were card holders in 1986, compared to 12% in 1983. He said 42% of 
those under age 25 had credit cards in 1986, compared to 20% in 1983. Many 
bankers and merchants agree that solicitations for new credit card customers 
have increased, but they attribute it to wider acceptance of credit cards and 
growing competition for customers. 
</P>
<P>
This rivalry has pressured issuers to reduce annual fees or lower interest 
rates, at a time when interest rates have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
Further squeezing profits are tax-law changes reducing the deductibility of 
credit card interest. The ABA says about a third of all card users used to pay 
their entire bills at the end of the month, but in the last year that rose to 
40%. Many issuers had derived much of their earnings from interest payments on 
balances left outstanding.

FOR MOST CEOS, PERK IS STILL PREFERENCE

Lee A. Iacocca may be pulling down $18 million a year in salary and bonuses, 
but his counterparts in the rest of corporate America want you to know how the 
other half lives. 
</P>
<P>
The median salary for chief executives at the nation's small and medium-sized 
firms -- those with sales of less than $100 million -- is $139,000 a year, 
according to the National Institute of Business Management, which surveyed 562 
companies on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
If that seems like a weekly allowance compared to Iacocca's take, it should. 
But this cadre of executives doesn't seem to mind. They prefer the executive 
perk, things like wining and dining on the corporate expense account, driving a 
company car and socializing on company-paid country club memberships. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many executives at smaller companies, particularly private firms, are 
willing to forgo compensation in favor of plowing profits back into the 
business, which they may just happen to own themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Perks are more valuable to them than to larger company executives because 
their . . . personal compensation is not that exorbitant," said Harry H. 
Linowes, managing partner of BDO Seidman, an accounting and consulting firm 
that co-sponsored the survey along with the Research Institute of America. 
"They of necessity cannot afford to lay out of their own pockets for some of 
these most important things in life -- an automobile, a phone in the car or 
being able to belong to a country club." 
</P>
<P>
The corporate perks, which averaged $7,000 per executive, are a sign of the 
times. Four years ago, the use of car phones didn't even register on the 
survey's hit parade. Today, car phones are No. 9 on the chart, with 31% of the 
institute's members offering them to one or more executives. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as four years ago, offering tax preparation assistance to 
executives was not a big seller. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks partially to the complications of dealing with the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986, some 32% of companies offer tax help, compared to 25% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The use of entertainment expense accounts has also gained in popularity -- 67% 
of the companies offered some form of them in 1988, compared to 54% in 1987. 
This includes everything from credit cards for personal use, to country club, 
athletic and dining memberships, to first class business travel. 
</P>
<P>
The perk to watch, according to the institute, is personal computers. 
Currently, 13% of executives have the luxury of working at home on a personal 
computer, either paid for or provided by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Other perks on the cutting edge include liability insurance for executives and 
telephone credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Off the top 10 perk list are supplemental medical insurance, company paid 
parking, supplemental retirement plans, low or interest-free loans and 
financial counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The old stalwart, the company car, is still found in the garages of seven of 10 
executives.

ALCOHOL, DRUG USE IN MILITARY LOWEST SINCE '80, PENTAGON SAYS

Heavy alcohol and drug use among U.S. military personnel is continuing to 
decline and is at its lowest level since such surveys began in 1980, the 
Pentagon said today in releasing its 1988 report. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette smoking has also declined significantly since 1980, according to the 
final results of the Pentagon's 1988 "Worldwide Survey of Substance Abuse and 
Health Behaviors among Military Personnel." 
</P>
<P>
"The military population is somewhat older, has more officers, has more married 
personnel and is better educated than in 1980 -- factors that are associated 
with lower rates of substance use," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that use of all non-medical drugs during a one-month period 
declined from 27.6% of military personnel in 1980 to 4.8% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Marijuana use and use of other drugs declined significantly between 1985 and 
1988. Marijuana is still the most commonly used drug, with 2.7% of military 
personnel reporting its use within the last 30 days of taking the survey and 
6.1% reporting its use at some time in 1988.

Convoys of Soviet armored personnel carriers and tanks draped in red banners 
streamed back into the Soviet Union from Afghanistan today, crossing the Oxus 
River to a hero's welcome from waving children and soldiers' families. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda said moujahedeen rebels, who have battled 
Soviet troops for nine years, held their fire as Kremlin forces pulled out of 
Afghanistan in a huge convoy that left Kabul last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pravda said the last Soviet soldier had left the capital, a battalion 
of about 500 Soviet troops remained in Kabul to guard the airport until the end 
of a Soviet airlift taking out personnel and equipment and bringing in flour 
and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Igor Korolyov told reporters in the Soviet border town of Termez that 
30,000 troops had left Afghanistan during the second phase of the withdrawal. 
This indicated that about 20,000 Soviet forces remained in the country, in five 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
In one convoy, 300 men of the 350th Parachute Regiment riding 60 freshly washed 
tanks and armored personnel carriers crossed into Termez over the "Friendship 
Bridge" across the Oxus. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of schoolchildren waved flags, and soldiers' families brought to 
Termez by air and road waited to be reunited with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
Red banners draped across tanks proclaimed "We have fulfilled our orders" and 
"We defended the peaceful Afghan people." Some soldiers had stuck red 
carnations in their gun barrels. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the crossing, some young Soviet officers told foreign 
journalists that Moscow's decision to send troops to support the Kabul 
government nine years ago was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow pulled out half its 105,000 troops by last August in the first stage of 
the withdrawal due to be completed by Feb. 15 under accords on the conflict 
signed last year.

PLO BROKE TERRORISM VOW, ARENS SAYS

Launching a campaign to persuade the United States to halt its dialogue with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today 
accused the PLO of breaking its promise to refrain from terror. 
</P>
<P>
"Two days ago, we had an example of a terrorist act by a branch of the PLO," 
Arens said in a speech to the New York-based Conference of Presidents of Major 
American Jewish Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli troops killed five Palestinian 
fighters on the northern border of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in 
south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The radical PLO factions of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed Palestinian Liberation Front said 
their guerrillas were on a mission to attack Israeli positions. 
</P>
<P>
Arens said the action "clearly and unequivocally violated" U.S. conditions for 
opening talks with the PLO after a 13-year boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"I presume that in Washington, they also noticed what happened. But, to the 
extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we will draw his attention to 
it," Arens added on Israel Radio after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official later said, "Israel is calling on the United States 
to reconsider the dialogue considering that the PLO, the Habash faction, took 
responsibility for the attempt to penetrate Israel." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials shocked Israel by opening talks with the PLO in December after 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and said he accepted Israel.

President Corazon Aquino said today that she has sent a senior adviser to the 
United States to talk with Ferdinand E. Marcos' lawyers about a deal between 
the ousted Philippine strongman and the country he allegedly pillaged for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
She said she sent Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on 
Good Government, to Hawaii to verify Manila newspaper reports that Marcos 
"sincerely wants to discuss a settlement" of demands for the return of millions 
of dollars he is alleged to have stolen from the Philippines while in power. 
Caparas' trip has "nothing to do with bringing Marcos home -- only his money," 
said the Philippine Daily Globe newspaper, published by an Aquino aide.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: CHRISTMAS SPIRIT KEEPS HER MERRY REST OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Around her workplace, Dottie Kraus is called Santa Kraus and often gets Merry 
Krausmas wishes. It seems fitting, since she celebrates Christmas the year 
around with three Christmas trees and nearly 100 Santa Claus figures in her 
Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never get depressed if you have Santa Claus living in a Christmas room 
in your house," is her logical reason for the 365-day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus said she likes the feeling of good will that comes with Christmas. "I 
love Christmas, and it's a shame we can't keep that feeling the year around," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus notes, however, that more people seem to be spending additional time 
celebrating Christmas by leaving the tree and decorations up throughout 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that helps people keep the good-will spirit for a longer time, too," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
At Brea Junior High School, where Kraus works as a guidance counselor, she 
often metes out discipline in her office, which contains a year-round Christmas 
tree and part of her ornament collection. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the students know my feeling for Christmas, and many of them send me 
Santa Claus figures for presents, which I add to the collection," said Kraus, 
whose Santa Claus shopping trips extend as far north as Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus, a Brooklyn native, has developed a hobby from her affection for the 
yuletide holiday by collecting sundry holiday-related items, including music 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Her collections have taken a toll of her home, where she has removed closets to 
make room for her Christmas keepsakes, including 8-foot, 4-foot and 3-foot 
imitation Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
"During the Christmas holiday I buy a real tree for the living room and 
decorate it with the ornaments I have collected," she said. "I have to have a 
real tree for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
So well known is her Christmas spirit that Kraus was paid tribute at a 
leadership conference at the Anaheim Convention Center with an ornament-covered 
Christmas tree and a message that read, "Like this snowflake, Dottie is an 
original." 
</P>
<P>
The tree holds a place of honor in her office, where she works as a school 
activities director as well as an instructor for student government classes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she is the publications director for the California Assn. of 
Activities and is a founding member of the Leadership Assn. of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a whole lot of extra time," she said, "so I have to combine my 
Christmas shopping with my regular shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Kraus said she's happy with her job at the school but wouldn't mind getting an 
extra special Christmas present this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a job as an elementary school principal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There was Michael Gay, a 21-year-old sailor, having a good time on a weekend 
liberty from the battleship USS New Jersey, which is berthed in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to visit Newport Beach and went into a store for some ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he walked into an armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect rifled the cash register, ran out and made his getaway in a car. 
Gay jumped into his own car, and the chase was on. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately -- not knowing Gay was the good guy -- witnesses in the parking 
lot gave police Gay's 
</P>
<P>
license plate number. It wasn't long before he was stopped by officers. 
</P>
<P>
And would you believe that while Gay was explaining the mistake, the suspect 
had made a U-turn and was driving by the officers? 
</P>
<P>
Gay alertly pointed him out, so the cops took off and nabbed the suspect. The 
arraignment is set for Feb. 16 in Santa Ana Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Villa Nova Restaurant in Newport Beach gave Gay its Outstanding Citizen 
Award -- as well as a complimentary meal. 
</P>
<P>
With ice cream.

PUBLIC WORKSHOP ON TRANSPORTATION OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest in a series of public workshops on the future of transportation in 
Orange County is scheduled for Thursday night at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, sponsored by the Orange County Transportation Commission, is an 
opportunity for the public to present ideas about a 20-year master plan of 
transportation improvements being prepared for eventual use in a sales tax 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Although no formal decision has been made, county officials are considering a 
half-cent sales tax for transportation projects. The proposed tax may be 
contained in a ballot measure that would be placed before voters as soon as 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The Saddleback College workshop will be held from 7:30 to 10 p.m. in Fine Arts 
Room 101 at the Mission Viejo campus, 28000 Marguerite Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
A similar workshop is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the Oasis Senior Citizens Center 
in Corona del Mar.

READING ALL ABOUT IT MAKES 'THE LAGOON CYCLE' A CHORE TO APPRECIATE 
</P>

"Performance, text, image, interactions -- we're involved in everything," 
asserts Helen Mayer Harrison, the matronly, confident-looking woman whose work 
is on display at the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about that," interrupts Newton Harrison, her bearded husband. 
"I'm not involved in everything. I'd like to say we're involved in almost 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Harrison laughs. The couple (she is an educator; he is a sculptor and 
painter) have spent the last 18 years collaborating on projects at the 
crossroads of science, environmental studies and art. What they do is as close 
to "everything" as seems humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
They work in the real world -- studying harmful land uses and ways of 
preserving the ecosystem, experimenting with methods to generate a cheap food 
supply, creating a greenbelt in San Jose and a promenade in Baltimore. And they 
translate their research and opinions into performances, site-specific works 
and permanent documents that can be shown in museum settings. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, they are showing their "Lagoon Cycle," a seven-part artist's 
book that has been unbound and mounted on the gallery walls. It documents the 
wide repercussions and influences of their 12-year experimentation with an 
edible crab that breeds in a lagoon in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
A reader finds Newton and Helen assuming the respective roles of "Lagoonmaker" 
and "Witness" to hash out their ideas in metaphor-laced dialogues. Often, other 
characters intrude. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, a Sri Lankan talks about how the richly stocked lagoons in his 
country are being depleted by foreign fishing fleets while modernization of the 
dams and reservoirs is impoverishing the people and ruining the land's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sri Lankans -- shopkeeper, priest, taxi driver, actor, doctor, student, 
water department official, tourist guide -- add their own two cents about the 
country's lingering traditions and recent changes. The truth of the matter is 
elusive, seen through a kaleidoscope of personal interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the reader begins to absorb the texture of the Harrisons' 
experience, and realizes that a topic with implications as vast as ecology 
necessarily impinges on such far-flung considerations as religion, history, 
economics, legend, habit and symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what they learned in Sri Lanka, the Harrisons write of constructing a 
tank, figure out how to simulate conditions in the lagoon, acquire grant 
support for the project and even come to empathize with their captive 
crustaceans. Other people -- an investor, a scientist, a newspaper publisher, 
an accountant and a political radical -- evince interest in the experiment, but 
each has a personal ax to grind. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Harrisons propose to create an estuarial lagoon in California's 
Colorado Desert fed by the briny Salton Sea and the fresh-water All-American 
Canal, and they find themselves looking at maps of the coastal area in strange 
new ways. To the Lagoonmaker, the Salton Sea becomes "a diseased bladder," and 
he imagines himself "as a surgeon, inserting a catheter and generating an 
artificial urethra." 
</P>
<P>
The Witness replies that the ocean then becomes a septic tank. If the Salton 
Sea is flushed out by making it a lagoon, that means 360 square miles of 
contaminated, too-salty water will be transferred to the Pacific. And who will 
flush that out? 
</P>
<P>
The latter stages of "The Lagoon Cycle" become increasingly metaphorical and 
speculative, climaxing in a great melodic crescendo of statements about a 
global phenomenon: the persistent rise in the water level that one day will 
force the populations of the world to "withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
Woven through the pages and pages of narrative are meticulous maps, diagrams, 
colored drawings and hand-colored photographs. But the essential meaning, 
energy and poetic reverberation of the piece comes largely from the power of 
the written word. And therein lies a problem. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that many works of contemporary art convey their message only with 
exceedingly careful observation and a great deal of thought on the part of the 
viewer. But "The Lagoon Cycle" exhibit demands that viewers endure eyestrain 
and fatigue while trying to read a dense, handwritten manuscript that snakes 
around the gallery walls. And that's a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
Although the light-colored script helps to give the dialogue a personal, 
individualistic character, a typeface would have been much easier on the eyes. 
But even with a clearer text, this is a book that, like any other, begs to be 
handled by a comfortably seated reader. 
</P>
<P>
A closed copy of the original limited-edition book, positioned under a dramatic 
light and chained off from viewers' grubby hands, is available for the faithful 
to gaze upon in a separate gallery -- an absurdly pseudo-dramatic installation 
that doesn't jibe with what the Harrisons are all about. 
</P>
<P>
The full text is available in the paperback catalogue of the exhibition. Still, 
the optimum (though undeniably pricey) solution to exhibiting "The Lagoon 
Cycle" in museums might be to translate the text, maps and charts into an 
interactive computer program and show the drawings and photographs separately. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the exhibit includes an excellent short video introduction to 
the Harrisons and their work, created at the Long Beach Museum of Art Video 
Annex by Joe Leonardi and Cathleen Kane with the support of the Fellows of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the exhibit's mechanical problems, the project itself is extraordinary 
-- rather like a lively mini-university dispensing information, analysis, 
doubt, vision and poetic discourse. Not to mention a cogent and timely warning 
of ecological crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lagoon Cycle" continues through March 12 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 
Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. 
Admission: $2. Information: (714) 494-6531.

ORANGE COUNTY DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
SNOW FALLS IN WIDE AREA AS MERCURY DIPS

Arctic air continued to assault Southern California on Sunday, bringing reports 
of snowfall in low-lying areas from Riverside to Orange County, keeping high 
temperatures at record or near-record low levels and prompting officials to 
issue freeze warnings for some agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said Sunday that the death of a man believed to have 
been a transient may have been caused by exposure to the cold weekend weather, 
and there were reports of snow falling in Rancho Santa Margarita and Trabuco 
Canyon, although it dissolved as it touched the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervising Deputy Coroner Rick Plows said the body was found 
early Saturday morning near the Slater Avenue overpass of the San Diego Freeway 
in Fountain Valley. The victim, who carried no identification, was pronounced 
dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center and may be "a 
possible hypothermia death," Plows said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was described as a white male 5-feet, 9 inches tall, 124 pounds, about 
60 years old, with a 3- or 4-day growth of beard, black-gray hair, hazel eyes 
and a tattoo spelling "Jeef" in a heart on his upper right arm. He was wearing 
light-blue jeans, a light-blue, long-sleeve shirt, a dark-blue-and-tan, 
long-sleeve sweater and yellow-and-brown rosary beads with a white cross around 
his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"Our examination today revealed that he has had a stroke in the past," Plows 
said. Anyone with information about the victim is asked to contact the 
sheriff-coroner's office at (714) 647-7400. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's high in Santa Ana reached 55 degrees, after a low of 39 Saturday 
night, said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today and Tuesday is mostly clear skies and cool temperatures, 
with daytime temperatures in the 50s and upper 40s, Dittmann said. Winds are 
expected to gust up to 30 m.p.h. below the canyons, and nights will be very 
cold, especially in wind-protected areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol dispatcher Janelle Clem said there were reports of 
snow "in Trabuco Canyon, Rancho Santa Margarita, a bunch of places." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not sticking," she said. "Maybe tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Civic Center, a peak reading of 53 degrees was recorded, 
just 1 degree warmer than the coldest high for the date, recorded in 1909. The 
mercury at UC Riverside reached just 47, shattering the old low maximum of 51 
degrees set in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Snow showers were reported Sunday in the San Bernardino Valley, and snow stuck 
to the ground for a time near Rancho Cucamonga, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Mid-20s 
</P>
<P>
March Air Force Base, near Riverside, reported snow showers at 1,500 feet. 
Temperatures were expected to drop into the mid-20s this morning and Tuesday, 
prompting the weather service to issue a frost advisory for inland valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Cold air moved into San Diego County, with the weather service saying the 
coldest inland areas will drop to the upper 20s. Agricultural interests in 
those areas were alerted to take measures to protect crops from frost. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight will be even colder, the weather service said, as lows drop to the low 
and middle 20s. The frost advisory will remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, light snow covered the higher hills of the Bay Area on 
Sunday after overnight temperatures dipped below freezing.

JUDGE TO HEAR LAWSUIT TODAY OVER GOP USE OF POLL GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 2 months of partisan charges and countercharges, a lawsuit challenging 
the Orange County Republican Party's decision to station uniformed security 
guards at polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts on Election Day is to 
go before a federal judge today. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Judge J. Spencer Letts will hear motions 
to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought by Latino groups, a laborers' union 
and several individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the defendants are the county and state Republican Party organizations, 
county Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Pringle won the 72nd Assembly District election in November over Democrat 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach by 867 votes. All 20 Santa Ana voting precincts 
to which the guards were sent are in the 72nd District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Democrats Keep Issue Alive 
</P>
<P>
On another front, county Democrats resolved last week to ask for up to $100,000 
from the state Democratic Party at its convention next weekend in Sacramento to 
pay for an attempt to recall Pringle because of the guards incident. While the 
resolution is given little chance of passing, it has served as a rallying point 
for local Democrats who want to keep the issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes and others involved in hiring the guards have said they were a 
necessary precaution because of rumors that Democrats might try to bus illegal 
voters into the 72nd District to tip the election to Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino groups' lawsuit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in 
Spanish admonishing non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino 
voters and may have frightened them away from the polls. It asks that election 
results in the district be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"They found the weakest link in our party," Stanton City Councilman Sal Sapien 
told Democrats meeting last week in Santa Ana. "Here we have people who are 
going to vote for the first time in their lives, who are normally intimidated 
by uniforms. . . . So therefore, the first time they get to the polling place, 
they have these people in uniforms asking them for ID, asking them for 
registration, asking them if they are citizens of the United States. And many 
of them had a hard time understanding what it was all about." 
</P>
<P>
Letts, who was appointed to the federal bench during the Reagan presidency, 
will hear arguments on whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue over the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
He will also weigh the defendants' assertions that no actual harm can be shown 
because there is no proof that anyone actually failed to vote because of the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
But even if this assertion is so, plaintiffs' attorney Kathleen Purcell argued 
in papers filed with the court, "the right to vote . . . encompasses more than 
merely the right to mark a ballot. It includes within its scope the right to be 
free from coercion, intimidation and retaliation for exercising the franchise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sapien Leads Movement 
</P>
<P>
The county Democratic Party's effort to get a Pringle recall movement afoot has 
been led by Sapien. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can commit the state party to do something about this, we have a better 
chance of redressing the issue," Sapien said at a Democratic Central Committee 
meeting last week. "Even if it's $1,000, whatever it is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But so far the recall idea has brought a tepid response from Democratic 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said he thinks it is good 
that Democrats are keeping the guards issue before public, "but in terms of it 
becoming a major Democratic effort . . . I don't think that's to be." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Jetton, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
said Brown is "appalled and displeased" over the use of the guards and "the 
implied blocking of people's right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that "we haven't seen any evidence that it made a 
difference in the outcome" of the election. "Barring that evidence, I don't 
know what could be done." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who helped Thierbach run his campaign, 
said the recall effort is "a way to remind people that just because the 
election is over with, people still have to take responsibility for their 
actions, whether it's Curt Pringle or Tom Fuentes." 
</P>
<P>
County Democratic Party Chairman Mike Balmages said local Democrats would like 
to get money from the state party organization to use for the recall "or 
alternatively on a very early start on taking back the seat in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages, responding to earlier criticism by Fuentes that the guards issue was 
being used for partisan politics, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's right," Balmages said. "I think it is a partisan political 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We ought not to let the people who perpetrated it . . . get away 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes could not be reached for comment about recent developments.

MOLEST SUSPECT SAYS HE'S MISUNDERSTOOD, BUT PROSECUTORS INSIST HE'S A CON MAN

There is a picture of James Allen Hydrick sitting at the base of the Great 
Pyramid of Giza, feet crossed in the lotus position, eyes raised toward the 
heavens, a white cotton kaffiyeh headdress shielding his face from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
As Hydrick tells it, the hurricane-force winds that he summoned through 
meditation suddenly began whipping through the Western Desert. It was, he says, 
quite an impressive show for the Egyptian dignitaries who had gathered to watch 
this young American demonstrate his psychic powers. 
</P>
<P>
He prizes the picture, one of the many faces of James Allen Hydrick. 
</P>
<P>
In one series of photos, Hydrick, his tattooed arms set off by a jet black 
martial arts outfit and white headband, smashing through six slabs of concrete 
with a bare fist at Venice Beach. A crowd of spectators is shown cheering, and 
Hydrick responds with a muscular arm raised in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
These are the images that James Allen Hydrick wants the world to see: of 
achievement, of success, of a man who has earned the adoration and respect of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
But Huntington Beach police see a different person in the 29-year-old karate 
expert currently held in a high-security area of the Orange County Jail. What 
they see is a master manipulator, a fast-talking con artist who finally ran 
afoul of the law one too many times. 
</P>
<P>
Between last June and September, police say, while Hydrick was living in a 
small apartment in downtown Huntington Beach just a few blocks from the ocean, 
he befriended a group of young boys who were awed by his tales of psychic 
tricks and martial arts demonstrations. Then, according to police, Hydrick 
lured them to his apartment, where he molested them in exchange for food, drugs 
and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick now faces 13 counts of felonychild molestation, one misdemeanor child 
molestation charge and one count of failing to register as a sex offender. 
Authorities have declined to identify the exact number of alleged victims. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski said the sex offender status stemmed from a 
1978 incident in Santa Monica in which Hydrick was convicted of oral 
copulation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plea Yet 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick has yet to enter a plea because his arraignment has been postponed at 
least three times, in part because of the controversy that surrounds the man 
who calls himself "Sir James" and claims to have escaped from no fewer than 148 
jails and institutions across the United States. When he has appeared in court, 
it has been amid uncommonly tight security. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick is scheduled for arraignment again today in West Orange County 
Municipal Court in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick's notoriety stems from his self-professed ability to slip out of 
handcuffs and bust out of the strongest prisons, his undisputed expertise in 
karate and tae kwon do, and a bizarre tale about how he was transported back to 
California after being arrested in Georgia and extradited. 
</P>
<P>
According to law enforcement officials, private security guards who had been 
driving Hydrick back to California became unnerved when they suspected that 
Hydrick was using supernatural powers to rock the van. In Johnson County, Ark., 
where Hydrick was dropped off with local authorities, the security guards 
warned county jailers not to look Hydrick in the eye for fear he might cast a 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Hydrick arrived in Orange County earlier this month, local 
officials already knew of his reputation and his love of publicity. Jail guards 
joked about Hydrick levitating himself out of the downtown Santa Ana facility 
to freedom, about the prisoner giving "the evil eye" to guards. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Boyd, the Orange County public defender who represents Hydrick, finds 
her client in a precarious position because of the publicity and stories about 
supernatural powers and multiple escapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors are abounding about what he is capable of, and I want to stop the 
circus atmosphere every time he comes to court," Boyd said. "This guy does have 
an ability to slip out of his cuffs . . . (but) I don't have any personal 
knowledge of him putting hexes on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Neither prosecutor Koski nor Huntington Beach police would elaborate on the 
case against Hydrick, but they did say they consider him an escape risk because 
of his past. Koski said it had been confirmed that Hydrick escaped from at 
least three jails in Utah, Georgia and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He's Perplexed 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, Hydrick said he is innocent and is perplexed 
about why the young men he had befriended in Huntington Beach had turned on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart I don't think I did wrong," he said. "I didn't hurt anybody. I 
like kids. I wouldn't ever hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a soft accent that told of his rural Deep South upbringing, Hydrick 
denied that he had ever presented himself as someone gifted with supernatural 
powers, but affirmed that he had escaped from countless jails, allegedly after 
being mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
"If they treat me like an animal, I act like an animal, and I get out," he 
said. "(But) I'm no more psychic than you are. I don't know where that started. 
My promotions are breaking bricks with my hands, that's all. If I have 
supernatural powers -- and sometimes I can do funny things with my mind -- I 
don't know it." Hydrick said he was appearing in promotions for a local 
sportswear company, breaking bricks and concrete with his hands, when he began 
teaching a group of Huntington Beach teen-agers the martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never hurt anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims of Escape 
</P>
<P>
In a cover story on Hydrick that appeared in the November issue of Inside 
Kung-Fu magazine, a martial arts trade journal, Hydrick made his claim to have 
escaped from 148 jails and other institutions. It was in that story that he was 
credited with whipping up an 80-m.p.h. wind for the Egyptian officials. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick said he was in Egypt on a promotional tour, but like so many things 
about this man, even that seems in dispute. His adoptive mother told The Times 
that the 1981 trip was not a promotional tour but rather a simple vacation, and 
that there was no demonstration before local Egyptian dignitaries. She said she 
knew nothing about her son making the winds howl in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he'd say that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One story that Hydrick likes to tell, but that could not be confirmed, centered 
on his claim that about 10 years ago he spent a year wandering the Savannah 
River in Georgia with a Tibetan monk learning kung fu and other martial arts 
disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear, however, is that he did learn martial arts from someone -- and 
excelled at it. Last year he set an unofficial world record by breaking 89 
inches of concrete at a tournament in Long Beach, according to Inside Kung-Fu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Martial Arts Expert 
</P>
<P>
His expertise at martial arts and his alleged psychic ability, moreover, have 
been the subject of at least three syndicated television talk shows. 
Ironically, it was his last television appearance, on the nationally televised 
"Sally Jessy Raphael" show on Nov. 29, that led to his arrest. An off-duty 
Huntington Beach police officer saw him on the show and tracked him down to 
Georgia, where he was in custody on an unrelated charge. 
</P>
<P>
If Hydrick presents a complex picture in public, his family and friends say 
that beneath all the bravado is a troubled young man who has been in and out of 
jails since he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of what Allen does are just tricks," said his sister, Deborah Olmstead, 
speaking from New Ellington, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
And all the talk about psychic powers and putting hexes on people? "That's just 
Allen talking big again, trying to get attention," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Olmstead said she believes her brother's problems stem from a desire "to be 
somebody. Even now he feels like he is a nobody. He wants so much to call my 
daddy up say, 'Hey, aren't you proud of me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Olmstead and her brother, Billy Hydrick of Gloverville, S.C., said that they 
know of at least six different times that Hydrick escaped from local jails in 
South Carolina and Georgia, but that the escapes were not the result of him 
smashing through bars or putting hexes on guards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walked Out the Door 
</P>
<P>
"One time a deputy went to answer the phone and Allen just walked out the 
door," his brother said. "That was about all there was to it." 
</P>
<P>
In Aiken County, S.C., Sheriff Carroll Heath described Hydrick as a perennial 
problem who "has made a right good pest of himself." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no psychologist, but let's face it, everybody likes to be liked," Heath 
said. "Problem with James, he didn't attract too much attention from the adult 
population but the kids idolized him. He'd lay that Rambo stuff in their heads. 
He'd tell everyone that he had a chauffeur and a limo down around Atlanta, 
about how famous he was, that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Heath said, Hydrick escaped from the Aiken County Jail by 
kicking out some concrete blocks and slithering through a hole, along with two 
other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to be psychic to do that," he said. "But he did have some 
martial arts training. One time he kicked the whole top of a steel door down 
with his feet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Childhood 
</P>
<P>
Janice Shrock Smith, a 60-year-old Salt Lake City woman who adopted Hydrick 
when he was almost 22, said the seeds of her son's problems were sown in a 
troubled childhood in which he was abused and abandoned. She said she adopted 
Hydrick because "I thought I could help him." 
</P>
<P>
The Hydrick children were taken from their parents when they were toddlers and 
placed in a succession of foster homes and institutions. By his own count, 
Hydrick was moved among at least seven different foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an abused baby," Smith said. "It's not his fault. It's bravisimo that 
comes through and they don't understand their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is convinced that Hydrick is psychic, said her adopted son was 
always drawn to teen-agers because he empathized with them, seeing a little of 
himself in the troubled youngsters who would watch him break bricks and perform 
other martial arts feats on the beaches of California. 
</P>
<P>
"He is like a Pied Piper," she said. "He is not a child molester. He can't 
stand to see parents abusing kids. He feels for kids who are having problems 
with their parents. He is tremendously naive when it comes to kids. He forms an 
attachment, a protective attachment to them. He feels for kids who are having 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
To Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Bill Peterson, the Hydrick case is a simple one 
of child molestation that should not be made "larger than life." 
</P>
<P>
"The charges speak for themselves," Peterson said, saying he could not comment 
on details of the case. "He is very manipulative. This gentleman appears to 
like publicity. He is a showman."

NOTEBOOK: DAYWORKERS ARE HEROES TO FAMILIES IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By its very nature, daily journalism often provides little more than a snapshot 
of any given story. Reporters document events as they evolve, and quite often 
the first published version of an incident yields only a glimpse of a much 
larger story. 
</P>
<P>
That's why we keep writing and reporting -- to try to get it right, to set the 
record straight, to find that one truth that always lurks behind the headlines. 
But there is never enough space to write everything you want, to include all 
the background that helps round out stories and puts things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about this the other day as this newspaper ran another story on the 
Latino dayworkers who seem to have caused such a stir in some parts of Orange 
County. They hang around the streets and in convenience stores, loitering about 
drinking coffee until someone picks them up for a construction job or to plant 
shrubs or dig ditches for minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these young men are from Mexico, many of them are here illegally, and 
at times they have made nuisances of themselves by their mere presence. Some 
merchants, for example, say they scare away other customers by hanging around 
in knots in front of stores. 
</P>
<P>
But their presence in the county is only part of a much larger story. The part 
that isn't often covered concerns the motivation that brings these men here in 
the first place -- and the wives and children and homes they leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining The Times, I lived and worked in Mexico for more than 3 years as 
the Latin American correspondent for the Dallas Times Herald. 
</P>
<P>
One of my last assignments in that job was a series on immigration, dealing 
with the young men who leave their families and travel to the United States to 
scrape up money that they can send back to Mexico. I spent several weeks 
traveling the countryside, visiting such small towns as Asuncion de Ocotlan, a 
village of maybe 1,000 residents outside of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. I talked 
to the men who would make the long trek to the border and to their wives about 
how the influx of U.S. dollars helped make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of towns like Asuncion de Ocotlan in Mexico, desperate and 
poor and built on the barren, unproductive soil of Mexico, villages that 
literally send their entire male populations north looking for seasonal labor. 
Most of these people cross the border illegally, not with the intention of 
staying but only to collect enough money to get them through the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Sit down with these people in their homes, and they will tell you of the 
heartbreak of seeing the men leave town en masse each year, how they pray at 
night that these fathers and husbands and brothers will make it safely across 
the border, how the children learn to grow up without their fathers around. 
These are kind and gentle people who risk so much for what, to us, seems so 
little. 
</P>
<P>
I remember Rosario, a diminutive and gracious grandmother who pointed with 
pride to an old electric stove and a single bed sitting on a rusty metal frame. 
It was the only electric stove in Asuncion de Ocotlan; it was bought with the 
dollars that Rosario's three sons had made by working in the strawberry and 
vegetable fields near Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The floor in Rosario's tiny adobe house was dirt. She said they planned to pour 
concrete with the money the boys made the following year. 
</P>
<P>
I also remember the family in San Luis de la Paz, a village in central Mexico, 
where some of the men had gone to Dallas and Houston and other Texas cities to 
work. You could tell where these people lived: Their homes were the only ones 
with brick walls, concrete patios and shades on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
In a village without running water or indoor plumbing, one kindly matriarch 
told me with pride how good her life had been because of the work in el norte. 
She is blessed, she said, because 9 of her 12 children are male. Men, she said, 
can go north to make money and in turn take care of the elderly and the women. 
</P>
<P>
"They miss their children," she said. "And we miss them. Sometimes they are 
gone for 9 months, sometimes a year. But there is no work here, so they must 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when I look into the eyes of the dayworkers who gather on the 
streets of Laguna Beach and Orange and Santa Ana, I see the faces of Asuncion 
de Ocotlan and San Luis de la Paz. And I know why they're here.

POSTCRIPT: WITH TRIAL WELL PAST, FUTURE BRIGHTENING FOR JOERI DEBEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joeri DeBeer is setting his sights high and not looking back. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before his 21st birthday, the Netherlands native is engaged, 
attending college, playing basketball on a neighborhood team and anxiously 
awaiting the chance to become an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
All this is a long way from 3 years ago and DeBeer's murder trial for shooting 
his guardian and setting the body on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in that trial heard that Phillip Parsons, a convicted child molester, 
had persuaded DeBeer to leave his mother and stepfather, then living in Saudi 
Arabia, when he was 13, by promising to make the youth a motocross racing 
champion. In 1985, DeBeer testified, after years of abuse, he killed Parsons, 
51, when his guardian again tried to sexually assault him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury reluctantly found DeBeer guilty and then pleaded with the judge for 
leniency. Jurors offered to take DeBeer into their homes, and offered him money 
to start his life over. A northern California couple, Syd and Jenny Ward of 
Oakley, acquaintances of DeBeer through his motocross races with their son, 
offered to be the youth's new guardian family. 
</P>
<P>
After a year and a half with the Wards, DeBeer decided to move out. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many decisions were being made for me" at the Wards, he said. "Jenny Ward 
is a great lady and did a lot for me, but I was 19 and making mistakes, and in 
order for me to learn I had to be on my own. I had no idea where I was going to 
go or how I was going to make it, but I had to find out." 
</P>
<P>
DeBeer's move took him from Oakley to Antioch and Concord, where he stayed with 
friends for a few weeks at a time while continuing to take classes at Diablo 
Valley College in Pleasant Hill. It was in a philosophy class there that DeBeer 
met his fiancee, Pat Nguyen, 19, the daughter of a Vietnamese immigrant and an 
American soldier who had left the family in Vietnam before the war was over. 
</P>
<P>
At first, DeBeer said, Nguyen's mother disapproved of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat is half Vietnamese and half American. And at first her family didn't 
accept me because I wasn't Vietnamese or anything, but after awhile they got to 
know me and thought I was OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, DeBeer, Nguyen and her mother have lived in a two-bedroom 
apartment in San Ramon, a small city outside San Jose. DeBeer sold his car to 
pay the first and last months' rent, and Nguyen's mother pays the monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
DeBeer, a 6-foot, 2-inch blond with a diamond stud earring in his left ear, is 
studying African history, anthropology and computer science and is considering 
a career in business and computers. 
</P>
<P>
Although money for the trio is tight, they manage, DeBeer said. His college 
tuition and some of his other costs are paid by Patricia de Carion, one of the 
jurors in his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat's been basically like a mother to me," he said. "If it wasn't for her I 
wouldn't be in the position I am now. She really gives me a lot of courage to 
hang on." De Carion has been filling a scrapbook with every picture and letter 
she has received from DeBeer and newspaper clippings about him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Joeri a long time ago that I would never let him down, and I don't 
intend to break that promise," she said. "He's struggling financially because 
he can't get work, but hopefully the bill will pass." 
</P>
<P>
A bill introduced in Congress by Sen. Pete Wilson in 1987 would allow DeBeer to 
apply for U.S. citizenship. Currently he can't apply because a federal 
immigration judge has ordered him deported for violating his student visa by 
leaving the country for a fishing trip off Mexico and for Parsons' slaying, a 
"crime of moral turpitude." That order has been appealed, but Wilson's bill 
would override it. Without a green card, DeBeer cannot get a job. 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time you just stop and think, 'When is this going to happen?" 
DeBeer said about becoming a citizen. "At times I want to give up, but then I 
keep hoping and praying that one day I'll get a phone call that says, 'Guess 
what? Pick up your green card and get a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, DeBeer attends counseling sessions as part of his probation, 
which ends in June. He also keeps busy with the Hoopsters, his neighborhood 
basketball team, playing with his three dogs -- a rottweiler, golden retriever 
and poodle -- going to college and spending time with Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at life, Pat's probably the best thing that happened to me 
besides being released," DeBeer said. "It's almost like a fairy-tale story. 
We're around each other almost 24 hours a day and it only gets better." 
</P>
<P>
DeBeer said he and Nguyen will marry next summer if they have enough money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only getting married once, and I want it to be perfect," he said.

JUDO STANDOUT HOLDS FAMILY'S GOLDEN DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Okada is almost as shy as he is talented, so he doesn't waste words 
bragging about what he does best. That is why many people, even some of his 
wrestling teammates at Savanna High School, don't know that he is one of 
America's brightest hopes to make the 1992 Olympic team -- in judo. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that Okada, 16, is one of America's elite judo athletes and 
an outstanding high school wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
His great-grandfather first learned judo in his native Japan, the country where 
the sport originated. His grandfather competed in judo, but when he immigrated 
to Lomita, Calif., the family also began learning judo's American equivalent, 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
Okada's family tree reads like a Who's Who of judo and wrestling. His uncle, 
George Espinoza, wrestled at Arizona State and won a gold medal in the 1977 Pan 
American Games. Another uncle, Kenny Okada, was a member of the 1972 U.S. 
Olympic judo team that competed in Munich, West Germany. And Okada has two 
cousins who wrestle at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at a few family get-togethers and it is very rare that things don't 
erupt into the coffee table being moved and people sprawled about on the floor 
doing things," said Tom Caspari, Okada's wrestling coach at Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
Okada acknowledges that his father has had a profound influence on his judo 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I know (my father) would want me to be the first from the United States to win 
the Olympics in judo," Okada said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the dream of his father, Ted Okada, to become an Olympian in judo. He is 
a former high school national champion and senior national champion. In 1964, 
he was one of the youngest black belts in the nation at 15. But a knee injury 
playing high school football ended his competitive career. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has inherited the dream. 
</P>
<P>
Ted, one of the premier judo coaches for juniors (18 and under) in the United 
States, is the instructor at Orange County Buddhist Church judo club. He has 
trained Tony since he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It is what he tells me he wants," Ted said. "He knows it will sadden me (if he 
quits) but he also knows he must do it for himself, not because I want him to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scott, head of U.S. junior development for United States Judo 
Incorporated, recognized as the sport's governing body by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, said he doesn't believe Ted Okada lives through his son. 
</P>
<P>
"While Ted is a strict father, and makes sure Tony gets to judo practice, I 
don't think he lives through the kid," Scott said. "It takes a pretty secure 
man to say, 'My son is unique. He is his own person, and I have these goals for 
him, but I also know it is not me doing it, it is him.' He is really proud of 
his kid and rightly so. He is not a judo parent, not a Little League parent. 
Those kids usually drop out by the time they are out of high school and they 
are always rebelling. And I don't see that in Tony." 
</P>
<P>
When Tony was 11, he said he almost quit because "my uncles and dad and 
grandparents were telling me to do different things. I really didn't want to 
listen to anyone but my dad. Everyone's yelling at me to do one thing and 
another (person) is yelling the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
He was starting to dislike judo, when his dad intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked to me and said (I should) act like I was listening to them but do 
what I think is best because once I get good enough, I will know my own 
mistakes," Tony said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has been making all the right moves, so much so that the Olympic selection 
committee has had its eye on him for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
He is like a football player in that he likes the contact, said Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"In any fighting sport, be it judo, boxing or wrestling, you have to like to 
fight," Scott said. "I am not talking about in the bully-boy sense. . . . You 
can tell Tony enjoys the combat, the competition." 
</P>
<P>
"He really, truly is a young sensation," said Patrick Burris, one of the U.S. 
Olympic judo coaches. "It is uncanny someone that young could have the 
instincts he has already for the sport. His reactions are amazing. His balance 
is unparalleled in this sport at this time. He is very strong for a young man. 
And the way he moves -- the way he flows his knowledge of the sport is like an 
experienced veteran because he has fought in so many national and international 
tournaments as a young man, and quite honestly because of his uncles and 
father." 
</P>
<P>
Tony, who has a black belt in judo, competes in 25 to 30 judo tournaments 
annually with the financial help of his family and USJI. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to develop him as much as we can," Scott said. "We want to send him 
places and do things with him and spend some money on him to get this kid some 
opportunities he wouldn't otherwise have." 
</P>
<P>
Those opportunities have included travel across the United States and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
He visited Tokyo in 1987 to train with Japan's top coaches and with Yasuhiro 
Yamashita, 1984 gold-medalist, nine-time All-Japan champion and a national 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he traveled to Colorado Springs, Colo., for the U.S. Invitational 
Open tournament, an international competition featuring top seniors (21 and 
older) from 12 countries. Okada placed fifth and lost a close decision to 1984 
Olympic bronze medalist Ed Liddie. 
</P>
<P>
He won the National Junior Olympics in Marquette, Mich., in 1988 and a silver 
medal at the junior Pan-American Games in Mexico City in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last month he traveled to Bremen, West Germany, where he won a gold medal 
competing against the top high school youths from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But at Savanna, Tony is just another kid who likes surfing, dirt biking and 
wrestling. And though he certainly wouldn't boast about it, he is Orange 
County's top-rated wrestler at 126 pounds with a 35-4 record and victories in 
four of the five tournaments he has entered this season. He finished sixth in 
the Southern Section 3-A last season as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna wrestling Coach Caspari believes Okada has the potential to be a 
wrestling state champion. But he understands Okada's Olympic pursuits have 
priority right now. 
</P>
<P>
He is trying to make the Olympic team at 19 when the average age is 25 or 26, 
Caspari said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a 16-year-old, he is placing in (senior tournaments) and winning 
international tournaments. So actually in judo, he is a man right now. He is 
not a boy. In wrestling, he is a boy, and he is doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
After the Olympics, Tony plans to concentrate on collegiate wrestling. But for 
now, he plans to enter more senior tournaments so he can accrue enough 
recognition and points to be among the field of about 64 invited to the Olympic 
trials. From there, tournament competition will determine the final eight 
athletes to represent America in judo. 
</P>
<P>
Tony makes it clear that he doesn't plan just to attend the Olympics, but 
return a champion. "I think he is not only one of the great young athletes but 
a great young person," Olympic Coach Burris said. "In his attitude, his 
disposition, his manners, he is every bit the champion his parents could want 
him to be."

FORMER MATER DEI STAR CHRIS JACKSON ENDS LONG SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS AND A 
WINNING PROGRAM AT UC RIVERSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
A SUCCESS STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Jackson has never sought glory on the basketball court, only success. 
</P>
<P>
All he asks for is a winning season, maybe a conference championship. A playoff 
berth? Sure, why not? 
</P>
<P>
Success drove Jackson at Mater Dei High School and the lack of it drove him 
from UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
This desire for winning led Jackson to UC Riverside, after playing one year at 
Rancho Santiago College -- where, of course, he had success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect everything to turn our rosy all the time, I just want to win," 
Jackson said. "It's a terrible day when you lose." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has found plenty of success since he came to Riverside in the fall of 
1987. The Highlanders were 22-8 last season and are 17-2 this year. The times 
have been good, and so has Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly Jackson's greatest moment came on Christmas Day, which he thought was 
going to be one of those terrible days. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside had to face Iowa in the championship game of the Chaminade Christmas 
tournament in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Iowa, from the big time and Big Ten. Fourth-ranked Iowa. No one 
needed a caucus to predict the outcome of this one. 
</P>
<P>
"They were joking around, smiling and laughing, during warmups," Jackson said. 
"I don't think they were taking us seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the last laugh was on the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, a Division II team from the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., 
upset the Hawkeyes, 110-92. The Highlanders set a National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. record by making 21 of 36 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a 6-foot-4 senior, contributed 12 points while being guarded by Roy 
Marble, an All-Big Ten selection a year ago. It wasn't exactly a scoring 
onslaught, but Jackson did hit some key baskets. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the second half, the Hawkeyes were making a run. With the 
45-second shot clock winding down, Jackson got the ball behind the three-point 
line -- the National Basketball Assn. three-point line -- and sank a shot to 
beat the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Marble looked at me and said, 'That was luck,' " Jackson said. "The next time 
down, I went into the corner and made another three-pointer. Marble looked at 
me and shook his head. That still gets me pumped up. 
</P>
<P>
"We were little Riverside before, now we're big Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
Big or little, Jackson is at Riverside for just one reason -- success. And he 
hasn't been disappointed, because the Highlanders are ranked No. 1 in the NCAA 
Division II poll. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I didn't think we had a chance at Chris," Riverside Coach John Masi 
said. "I thought he was a little above our program. There were so many Division 
I schools interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
The trek that landed Jackson in Riverside began at the Long Beach Arena in 
March of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, an eighth-grader, was sitting in the rafters with his friend, Mike 
Fielder. They watched in awe as Inglewood defeated Long Beach Poly, 52-46, for 
the Southern Section major division championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We were watching Inglewood celebrating," Jackson said. "Mike and I decided 
right then that some day we were going to be the ones on the court 
celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
But, in his dream, Jackson wasn't wearing a Mater Dei jersey. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Monarchs had yet to win a Southern Section title and were 
considered just another good basketball school. 
</P>
<P>
When Ray Alvarado, Jackson's traveling team coach, told him about Mater Dei, it 
didn't really mean much. He was already set on attending La Quinta with his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
The matter might have died had not Alvarado told John Jackson, Chris' father, 
about the Monarchs' program. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents had always wanted to send their kids to a private high school," 
said Jackson, the youngest of seven children. "But they never had the means to 
do it until it was my turn to go to high school. My dad got it in his mind that 
Mater Dei was where I would go." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the vision that Catholic schools were strict," he said. "You had to go 
to church all the time and there were a bunch of nuns running around with 
rulers." 
</P>
<P>
All through the summer, Jackson pleaded with his parents not to force him to 
attend Mater Dei. Finally, the night before school was to start, his parents 
relented and said he didn't have to if he didn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, it was too late, I already had my clothes and books," Jackson said. 
"I was going to Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs were moderately successful in Jackson's sophomore season. They 
qualified for the Southern Section 4-A playoffs and reached the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, Gary McKnight replaced Bill Alexander as coach. Mater Dei went 
on to win the first of its five Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wasn't the star, but he was a key component -- a little scoring, a 
little rebounding, a little defense. "I never wanted to be a star, I just 
wanted the team to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It did. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982-83, the Monarchs defeated Long Beach Poly in the final, 62-44, at the 
Long Beach Arena, where Jackson and Mater Dei teammate Fielder had sat in the 
rafters three years before. 
</P>
<P>
"We were celebrating after the game and Mike and I looked and, at the same 
time, we said, 'remember,' " Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs finished 29-3 in 1983-84, but lost in the championship game to 
Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, college recruiters were making regular visits to Mater Dei, as 
they coveted the likes of Tom Lewis (6-7), Matt Beeuwsaert (6-6) and Mike 
Mitchell (6-5), as well as Jackson and Fielder (6-4). All would receive 
scholarships to Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my senior year was the first time I really took basketball seriously," 
Jackson said. "I not only wanted a scholarship, I wanted to go to a Division-I 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson accepted an offer from Jerry Pimm, the first-year coach at UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jackson was happy with his choice. 
</P>
<P>
Pimm was grooming Jackson to be the team's point guard. He even started a few 
games for the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was just how Jackson planned, except one thing -- winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was a little spoiled at Mater Dei," Jackson said. "I went from 
losing five games in two years to losing five games in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, Jackson was at an all-time low. He wasn't playing 
much, the team wasn't winning and basketball stopped being fun. 
</P>
<P>
Pimm met with Jackson over the summer and told him he was welcome to stay, but 
not obligated. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that in the end, Chris Jackson was the only person he had to 
satisfy," Pimm said. "If he stuck it out, he might have the success he was 
looking for. But I told him he should make a decision with himself in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson decided to leave and transferred to Rancho Santiago. He sat out his 
first year and got as far away from the basketball court as he could. 
</P>
<P>
"When a kid takes a year off like that, you never really know if he's going to 
come back," Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said. "Chris just said he needed 
the time to himself. We never had any meeting, although I made it a point to 
bump into him once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
The Dons won the Orange Empire Conference and reached the semifinals of the 
state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, recruiters came calling, but this time Jackson was ready. 
</P>
<P>
He made visits to TCU, Boise State, the University of San Diego and the 
University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in Coach Pagett's office one day, talking about all the schools 
I had visited," Jackson said. "I didn't really want to go to any of them. He 
asked what was wrong with those programs. Finally he said, 'You're just been 
spoiled by winning.' I realized he was right and that ruled out all those 
schools. Division II was the only other option." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was the starting point guard for Riverside last season, averaging 9.8 
points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. The Highlanders finished 22-8 
and shared the CCAA title with Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
This season, his numbers have improved, but not dramatically (10 points, 5 
rebounds and 5 assists per game). 
</P>
<P>
But it's enough that the Highlanders are successful on the court. Anything else 
is just a bonus.

Police have arrested a woman who forced her 13-year-old daughter into 
prostitution, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Two others arrested were a 36-year-old man who had paid for sex with the girl 
for the past four years and a woman who acted as an intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the operation, which came to light during an investigation of a 
murder in the area, ended last week when they raided the house where the 
encounters took place and found the man with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
They said the man, a local businessman, had been paying the girl's mother, 
herself a prostitute, and the woman intermediary to film the girl or have sex 
with her since she was 9 years old.

A Seal Beach man was killed this morning when a fire raced through his home 
near the central business district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Deitrick II, 55, was killed in the blaze in the 200 block of 2nd 
Street, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 4:17 a.m., she said, and two occupants of the house 
escaped. A woman was burned on the foot while fleeing the fire and was taken to 
Los Alamitos Medical Center. The other resident escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The two occupants who escaped tried to return to the house to rescue Deitrick 
but the heat from the fire prevented them from returning, Cha said. Cha said 
the house did not have a smoke detector.

DESKTOP COMPUTER PRICE CUT $200

<P>
Compaq Computer Corp. said today it has cut the suggested retail prices of its 
Deskpro 386S desktop computers by $200, sending its share price lower. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq was down $1.75 at $72.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said there is concern among investors that the price cuts may hurt the 
Houston-based personal computer maker's earnings or signal a weakness in sales 
of the 386S models. 
</P>
<P>
But Compaq spokesman Bob Beach said demand remains strong for the 386S line, 
which uses Intel Corp.'s 80386SX microprocessor. The line was introduced in 
June, 1988, and supplies just recently caught up with demand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the new price of the Deskpro 386 Model I was $3,599, while the 
Model 20 and Model 40 machines were priced at $4,299 and $4,999 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Beach said the timing of the price cuts followed Compaq's normal pattern for 
lowering prices over the course of a product's life. "This is pretty much in 
line with time lines for other products," he said. He said the reductions also 
reflect lower costs for the Intel chip.

<P>
The dollar ended mixed in European trading today after a round of central bank 
intervention dampened the currency's strength. Gold prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the absence of any strong policy statements 
arising from the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in Washington on 
Friday provided the foundation for a further strengthening of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
But the bullishness was dampened by intervention from the Federal Reserve, West 
German Bundesbank and other European central banks, which sold dollars and 
diluted the impact of the currency's rise. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later in London it was quoted at 129.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.7345, cheaper for buyers than the $1.7410 
exchange rate late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion was trading in London at a bid price of $388.95 a troy ounce, up 
from $388.25 bid late Friday.

In Zurich, the bid price was $387.50, down from $389.90 bid late Friday.

EC RESTRICTS MICROCHIP MARKETING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The European Community today introduced strict new rules affecting access to EC 
markets for microchips in a move that diplomats said could intensify U.S. and 
Japanese charges of protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
The EC's executive commission said in a statement that the regulation requires 
a crucial high-technology stage in the manufacture of microchips to take place 
in the community for them to be considered "made in the EC." 
</P>
<P>
Defining the origin of the wafer-thin semiconducting circuits, which are at the 
heart of computers and most modern electronic products, is important because 
any EC business importing them as components must pay duty on non-EC 
microchips. 
</P>
<P>
The EC said that for a microchip to count as EC-made, a process known as 
diffusion must take place in the community. Diffusion is the complex and costly 
procedure of imprinting the pattern of the microcircuit on wafers of silicon. 
</P>
<P>
That would exclude microchips that are assembled in the community from wafers 
diffused elsewhere, the practice of some, but not all, of the big U.S. and 
Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been established that the diffusion stage is technically the most 
complex, the most difficult and that which requires the biggest investment in 
research," the commission said in its statement to justify the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Some non-EC microchip manufacturers already carry out diffusion in the 
community, including Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Inc. and Japan's NEC Corp. 
So do big EC producers such as NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken of the 
Netherlands, West Germany's Siemens AG and Britain's Plessey Co. PLC.

Hansjoerg Tauscher of West Germany, a non-winner in three seasons on the World 
Cup circuit, won the gold medal in the weather-delayed men's downhill today at 
the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, 21, continuing a tradition of unexpected finishes in World 
Championship competition, was timed in 2 minutes, 10.39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Peter Mueller, the defending world champion in the downhill and a 
favorite in this race, finished 19-hundredths of a second back at 2:10.58 to 
take the silver medal, and Swiss teammate Karl Alpiger won the bronze in 
2:10.67. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss skiers claimed the next two places as well, with Daniel Mahrer finishing 
fourth in 2:10.91 and William Besse fifth in 2:10.94. 
</P>
<P>
Two other favorites, Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg and Pirmin Zurbriggen of 
Switzerland, finished out of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher's best previous finish in a World Cup race was fifth in a downhill at 
Laax, Switzerland, on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
No one expected Tauscher's gold-medal breakthrough today. He had finished no 
higher than sixth in any of the four training runs. 
</P>
<P>
The race, originally scheduled for Saturday, was postponed when three feet of 
snow inundated Beaver Creek. Earlier, high winds interrupted training and 
contributed to a crash by Zurbriggen, leaving him with a bruised upper back and 
bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Crews managed to clear the course of most of the fresh snow, but today's 
winning time was about two seconds slower than early training times on a 
harder, icier surface. 
</P>
<P>
Mahrer, with what was considered a disadvantageous start number (2) because 
early racers had to plow through more loose snow, posted a quick time that 
stood up until Tauscher, with bib No. 9, came down. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher was a full second behind Mahrer at the second intermediate clocking 
but had narrowed the gap to two-hundredths at the fourth intermediate, then 
made up the difference on the bottom part, which featured numerous bumps and 
rolls and some tight turns. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, running 11th, and Zurbriggen, starting 15th, could not catch him, 
although Mueller was slightly faster through the fourth intermediate clocking. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Norway's Atle Skaardal placed sixth in 2:10.99, followed by three 
Austrians: Helmut Hoeflehner in 2:11.24, Peter Wirnsberger in 2:11.52 and Roman 
Rupp in 2:11.60.

TOP-RATED SEYBOLDS FEEL TIME HAS COME FOR U.S. SKATING TITLE

This is the moment for Natalie and Wayne Seybold. They intend to seize it -- 
and their first U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Seybolds are the top-rated pair in the country. After 16 years of skating 
together and seven years on the national scene, the brother and sister from 
Marion, Ind., say they are ready for their biggest season. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're the top-ranked team in the United States, and we want to come 
here and prove that and win a gold medal," Wayne said. "We've been junior 
national champions, we've been on the world team, the Olympic team, we've been 
second, third, fourth, fifth and ninth at senior nationals. We've won 
international competitions and things, but the one thing that's eluded us is 
the national championship. That's what this year is all about." 
</P>
<P>
With Olympic bronze medalists Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard now professionals 
and their prospective successors, Gillian Wachsman and Todd Waggoner retired, 
the Seybolds are favored this week. They begin competition Wednesday night with 
the original program and finish Friday with their free skating program. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens this year in Baltimore will affect what happens in the Olympic 
trials in 1992," said Wayne, 25, two years older than his sister. "It's just a 
fact, because you've got to have kids who are consistent, who are willing to 
train year after year and make their skating grow over the four-year period in 
order to have good representation at the Olympic Games." 
</P>
<P>
The United States had that at Calgary -- Wachsman and Waggoner were fifth and 
the Seybolds 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest foes for the Seybolds probably will be Katy Keeley and Joe Mero, 
and the sensational teen-agers Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo, who won the 
1988 world junior crown. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi also has surged into the rankings in women's singles. She will push 
1987 American champion Jill Trenary, who was fourth at the Calgary Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo will double up in singles but is not considered a challenger to Chris 
Bowman or Paul Wylie, who are rated even at the top of American men's skating 
now that Olympic champion Brian Boitano has turned pro.

CLEVELAND ATHLETES IN CALL GIRL BOOK

The names and addresses of two Cleveland Browns football players and a 
Cleveland Indians baseball player appear in a black book seized by police from 
the alleged ringleader of a prostitution ring, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Sunday a claim by police that prostitutes 
from a call girl ring also worked in other National Football League cities has 
prompted Browns officials to notify the NFL about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Among the names in the black book are quarterback Bernie Kosar and cornerback 
Hanford Dixon of the Browns and Indians outfielder Mel Hall, the Plain Dealer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar and Dixon declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Byrne, Browns spokesman, said the Browns' director of security, Ted 
Chappelle, telephoned NFL security personnel on Wednesday to alert them to 
allegations that have surfaced since the Jan. 13 arrest of Karen M. Panek, 37. 
</P>
<P>
Panek, who pleaded not guilty Friday to a charge of promoting prostitution, 
allegedly operated a ring involving about 40 suburban women under the guise of 
escort services in Cleveland and Akron. Panek's lawyer, Stuart H. Lippe, has 
insisted that a black book containing about 100 names that was seized by police 
is only an address book. 
</P>
<P>
Browns officials suggested that Dixon's name was in the book because of his 
involvement with a March of Dimes fund-raising auction in which Panek bid $600 
for a date with him. They said Panek became angry when Dixon refused to go 
through with the date. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he knew Panek only casually because they had once lived in the same 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Browns owner Art Modell said he had agreed to talk about the appearance of 
players' names in the black book "because this involves the reputations of some 
very important people to us." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, who said he discussed the black book with Kosar last week, described the 
quarterback as extremely upset that his name had become associated with Panek 
by somehow getting into her black book. Byrne said Kosar had told him he didn't 
remember ever meeting Panek and didn't know why his name was in the book.

RED WINGS' KLIMA JAILED 3 DAYS AND FINED FOR DRUNK DRIVING

Detroit Red Wing Petr Klima was sentenced today to three days in jail for his 
guilty plea to a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, a court 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge fined him $550 or 40 days in jail, plus a $60 screening fee, plus 
three days in jail, with credit for one day already served," said 44th District 
Court administrator Kevin Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
Klima was taken to the Royal Oak Police Department and to the city jail 
immediately after his 9 a.m. sentencing before Judge Daniel Sawicki, Sutherland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki also sentenced Klima to 18 months' probation and suspended his driver's 
license for six months, Sutherland said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings left wing was fined $150 on a charge of failure to stop after an 
accident, to which he also pleaded guilty in December, Sutherland said. Both 
charges are misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Klima was arrested in October while still on probation for a 1987 impaired 
driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 2, 48th District Judge Edward Sosnick sentenced Klima to 31 days in 
jail and two years of probation and suspended his driver's license for six 
months for violating probation. Part of that sentence was served at a 
children's hospital.
